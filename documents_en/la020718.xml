<LD>At last, someone to blame for the shootings, beatings, kickings,
chokings, slammings and other forms of violence perpetrated by police
officers on handcuffed, unconscious, sleeping or dead persons in
their custody. It's the media's fault.</LD>
<LD>   For years I have pondered over who exactly to accuse when cops,
their tempers triggered by race, testicle squeezing or various forms
of "silent insolence," go on a rampage. Now I know.</LD>
<LD>   Since the most recent slamming/beating/choking by a policeman, it
has been pointed out by media critics that if we just hadn't, you
know, mentioned it, there'd be no big fuss. The trouble is, as my
mother used to say, we can't leave well enough alone.</LD>
<TE>   I am speaking here, of course, about Inglewood Police Officer
Jeremy Morse, a fun-loving, devout Christian, who did unto
16-year-old Donovan Jackson what he wouldn't have liked being done
unto him. What complicated matters is that portions of the beating
were videotaped by 27-year-old Mitchell Crooks, who, incidentally,
instead of being kept around to answer questions, was hustled off to
a cell in Placer County for alleged crimes.</TE>
<TE>   While the current to-do is partially his fault for videotaping the
beating in the first place, he's an amateur and didn't know that he
should have instantly turned off his camera when he saw Morse slam
the kid onto the hood of the car. But the majority of the blame for
stirring things up lies with us--the professional media--and today I
want to apologize on behalf of us all for causing such distress among
those within earshot. Or eyeshot. Whatever. It was my fault.</TE>
<TE>   The media's insistence on butting in where they aren't wanted has
been pointed out to me over and over again in the wake of Officer
Morse's display of curbside justice. E-mailers and telephone callers,
in angry references to "you guys," flayed not only what they
perceived to be our sensationalistic tendencies, but also our
annoying attention to details of the incident and to our insidious
delving into the background of the Inglewood Police Department, which
is proving to be something less than a center of gentility.</TE>
<TE>   Television was taken to task for simply showing Crooks' video in
the first place, intruding, as it did, on otherwise serene summer
days. Show more good news, critics carped: kids splashing in the surf
and half-naked women at the beach and maybe baseball players beating
each other senseless in the name of sport.</TE>
<TE>   I have, alas, no control over television and therefore do not feel
compelled to fully apologize for its faults. However, I do agree that
the public would be better served with shows exploring the first
sexual experiences of young men and women (due out soon) rather than
clips of unpleasant news events.</TE>
<TE>   And on top of everything else, why in God's name, I hear you
shout, do we keep pointing out that the 16-year-old kid was black and
Morse was white? Are we trying to imply, for heaven's sake, that some
cops are racist?</TE>
<TE>   But there I go again, as Ronald Reagan used to say, stirring
things up by suggesting that some cops just don't like people who
don't look or speak the way they do. There I go again, suggesting
that those cops--the racist ones--might take every opportunity
afforded them to display their dislike in a variety of convenient
ways.</TE>
<TE>   This could vary, as we have seen before, from a finger-shaking
no-no to a bullet in the heart. In terms of well-publicized police
violence, the name Rodney King, of course, instantly comes to
mind--the case of another darned video-taker not minding his own
business while the cops were attending to theirs.</TE>
<TE>   But at least King walked away. Others haven't been so lucky.
Margaret Mitchell, barely 5 feet tall and weighing only slightly more
than 100 pounds, was shot to death by a cop because she threatened
him with a screwdriver. And Tyisha Miller was shot 12 times by four
Riverside policemen, because, sitting half-drugged in her car, she
appeared to reach for a gun when they smashed in her window.</TE>
<TE>   The media raised a fuss about them too, I'm sorry to say, and I
guess I've got to apologize retroactively for our unacceptable
behavior in reporting the details of those, er, incidents and causing
so much strife. We should have left them alone. We shouldn't have
bothered.</TE>
<TE>   And, hey, while I'm at it, I'd like to apologize on the media's
behalf for a lot of other annoyances we've had the bad taste to
mention. Like: wars, holocausts, the spread of AIDS, corporate greed,
disgraced politicians and God knows how many acts of criminal
stupidity. There'll be no more of that. Like the messenger who was
killed because he brought the king bad news, we've learned our
lesson. It's happy talk from now on. Close your eyes and cover your
ears, and let the good times roll.</TE>

<HD>Work of a Gay Rights Pioneer Is Never Done</HD>
<DH>Advocate* With a memoir out, Betty Berzon, 74, looks to
fiction to right the movement's wrongs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEVERLY BEYETTE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is the second half of the century and a UCLA biologist named Omar
has discovered a test to identify the sexual orientation of newborns.
When he goes public with his test, he consults a gay research
assistant, who leads him to Artemis, a grass-roots gay leader.
Together, they create an institute to study gay life and launch a
network of after-school programs for gay children where they learn to
be happy and well-adjusted.</LD>
<LD>   As adults, they will be open about who they are--and politically
powerful. And, oh yes, with an assist from the new president,
legislation legalizing same-sex marriages will soon pass in the
Congress.</LD>
<LD>   "I just fix everything that's wrong with the gay rights movement.
It's a wonderful experience," says Betty Berzon, co-founder of the
L.A. Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center and, now, with this
work in progress, first-time novelist. Berzon, a psychotherapist who
for 30 years has specialized in counseling gays, has written five
nonfiction books dealing with gay and family issues and, most
recently, her memoir, "Surviving Madness: A Therapist's Own Story"
(University of Wisconsin, 2002).</LD>
<TE>   While the social fixes in her novel--with the working title "Queer
Babies"--are fictional, she is quick to point out those things that
need fixing within the gay movement are very real. Among these: What
she sees as a paucity of political leadership. "Most of the people
who think of themselves as gay leaders in this country, other [gays]
never heard of." And an overemphasis on fund-raising. "Too often
that's what gets talked about in gay and lesbian organizations,
rather than the work they're doing and the people being helped."</TE>
<TE>   Her book, which does not yet have a publisher, fixes that too.
"There's a unification of all gay organizations into one federation"
that fund-raises through tithing. "If every gay person in America
tithed one dollar a month, there would be enough money," Berzon says.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon in the book-lined den of the Studio City
home she shares with longtime partner Teresa DeCrescenzo, a social
worker and founder and director of Gay and Lesbian Adolescent Social
Services, Berzon, 74, reflected on her path from denial to
self-acceptance, contentment and activism.</TE>
<TE>   She describes that tortuous journey in her memoir. As the story
begins, she is 23 and, having just botched a wrist slashing, is
tethered to a bed in an L.A. psychiatric hospital. As a teenager,
she'd battled strange romantic feelings toward women. "I'd heard of
homosexuality ... heard that it was a sickness, and I wondered if I
had caught it."</TE>
<TE>   Later, at Stanford University, a female dorm-mate's sexual
advances so alarmed and confused her that she left school. She smiles
and says, "I left college because I thought I might be homosexual.
Now people go to college to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Berzon's subsequent road took some amazing turns. She dated a
young Si Newhouse (of the Conde Nast empire), made an awkward stab at
the Greenwich Village lesbian bar scene, spent 20 years in therapy,
had several lesbian affairs, ran her own bookstore in Hollywood, had
an affair with one of Anais Nin's two husbands, suffered a serious
depression and had an abortion in Tijuana after a fling in Rome with
an Iraqi banker.</TE>
<TE>   Found Her True Calling</TE>
<TE>   Luckily, an administrator at one of the mental hospitals she
stayed in saw in her the potential to help other troubled souls.
While working as a psychiatric aide, she earned a degree in
psychology from UCLA. One of her professors was Evelyn Hooker, a
social psychologist and groundbreaking researcher on the mental
health of gay men.</TE>
<TE>   Berzon later added a doctorate, worked with Carl Rogers, the
father of encounter groups, at La Jolla's Western Behavioral Sciences
Institute and was involved in the human-potential movement at Esalen,
a human potential institute in Big Sur. And she dated men.</TE>
<TE>   On her 40th birthday, she finally faced facts: She was a lesbian.</TE>
<TE>   She began conducting Quest for Love workshops for gays and
lesbians (where she met DeCrescenzo), helped found the L.A. Gay and
Lesbian Community Services Center and in 1971 co-founded the first
gay group within the American Psychiatric Assn. Two years later the
association deleted homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses
and the American Psychological Assn. soon followed suit.</TE>
<TE>   Berzon was a pioneer, says Bonnie Strickland, a psychology
professor at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and past
president of the American Psychological Assn. "It took great courage
for her to do what she did," considering that among psychologists and
psychiatrists homosexuality was a taboo subject until the late '70s,
Strickland says. "No question about it, she was well ahead of the
times. When I was growing up, and when she was growing up, for us to
even mention any lesbian interests, we'd be rushed off to a
psychiatric hospital."</TE>
<TE>   To Strickland, 65, who came out as a lesbian in her late teens,
Berzon has been a kind of Dear Abby. "There are some wonderful
lesbian therapists, but they weren't necessarily as public as Betty
was. They were writing more for the profession than for the public."</TE>
<TE>   Berzon stays on top of current issues with her advice column,
"Love Letters," on Planet- Out.com. With young people today "much,
much less conflicted" about their homosexuality, their issues have
moved beyond coming out. "Probably the hottest issue in the gay
rights movement is freedom to marry. Most gays want family life, not
the bar life that was once their lot."</TE>
<TE>   No state has legalized same-sex marriage but Berzon thinks it will
happen "in about 20 years," even though some gays oppose
legalization, saying "it's too much about being like the straights."</TE>
<TE>   Berzon considers herself married to DeCrescenzo and wears a gold
band. "We're registered in California as domestic partners," which
gives them some rights of the legally married, such as legal,
financial and medical decision making if one partner is
incapacitated--as well as the right to be a legal adoptive parent of
a partner's child. But, says Berzon, "That doesn't mean you are
married in the eyes of the IRS, or can automatically inherit." Even
in Vermont, which has legalized "civil unions," federal laws are not
affected.</TE>
<TE>   As a Californian, Berzon says, it's easy to think things are
pretty much OK for gays. But on a visit to St. Louis, her hometown,
earlier this summer, "Suddenly, I was transported back to the world
at large." The Southern Baptist Convention was meeting and Berzon
joined a peaceful protest staged by Soulforce, an interfaith group
opposing anti-gay religious policies and teachings. At issue: What
Soulforce says is the convention president's refusal to refute the
words of Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, a Southern Baptist. He said
in a ruling against a lesbian mother trying to get custody of her
three children that "confinement and even execution" were perhaps
appropriate to prevent homosexuals from parenting.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned With Legacy</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Malcolm Boyd, a retired Episcopal priest and noted
writer, was a founding member with Berzon of the now-defunct Los
Angeles Gay and Lesbian Writers Circle. "I think Betty's always been
a pioneer," he says. "Betty and I are elders. I see her in that
role," concerned with legacy and trying to help some boomer types
learn to be elders.</TE>
<TE>   When Berzon began writing about gay and lesbian issues in the
'70s, Boyd says, homosexual writers were decidedly "on the fringe,
quite separate. Nobody was interested in the books anyway, and people
couldn't be 'out' to write them, for the most part." The L.A.
writers' circle, which included the late Paul Monette, brought these
writers together to share ideas "and a few triumphs."</TE>
<TE>   Now semi-retired, Berzon sees some gay male patients. Most seek
counseling about relationships or workplace issues. If a man's family
refuses to accept that he is gay, she advises giving them time to get
used to the idea, bringing them books, taking them to a meeting of
Parents, Friends and Families of Gays. Above all, she counsels, "Keep
the subject alive. You must not withdraw."</TE>
<TE>   Berzon says, "There has been a tendency to sexualize being gay.
Parents don't like to think about the sex life of their children. You
counter it by talking about different parts of your life. I like to
say, 'If you never had sex again, you'd be just as gay as you are
now.'</TE>
<TE>   "There's an overarching sense of identity that all gay people
have. We have something very profound in common and we know it--who
we choose to socialize with, what we choose to do with our lives,
what occupations we enter."</TE>
<TE>   She finds that her "Love Letters" correspondents are distrustful
because they have bought into long-standing, largely outmoded,
beliefs that gay relationships don't endure. Male-male and
female-female partnerships each present unique challenges, says
Berzon. Men are "socialized to be competitive, strong and not
vulnerable" and this can create a power struggle between partners. In
lesbian relationships, "Women will simply over-identify with one
another. And I think women become much more dependent on one another
for a sense of feeling OK."</TE>
<TE>   Another issue for gays is aging. "We don't socialize
intergenerationally," Berzon says. "Older people are isolated in the
gay community. But that is changing." A few retirement communities
for gays have opened. New York-based Senior Action in a Gay
Environment, with a network of affiliates, is working to meet the
needs of the "gay and gray" who are alone and lonely, with no spousal
Social Security benefits or pensions.</TE>
<TE>   Still an Activist</TE>
<TE>   She is still doing her bit as an activist. Checking into
Cedars-Sinai in March last year for a mastectomy, Berzon confronted
an admissions clerk who asked whether she was single, married or
divorced. "I said, 'None of the above. I've lived with a woman for 29
years.' " Not an option allowed by the computer, said the clerk,
entering "single." Berzon protested in a letter to the top and,
ultimately, "domestic partner" was programmed into the admissions
system. "I'm kind of proud of that. I just badgered them."</TE>
<TE>   She and DeCrescenzo will reaffirm their commitment to each other
next year in a 30th anniversary ceremony. Of the relationship, she
says, "It seems pretty permanent. We have our crypts bought and paid
for" at Westwood Village Memorial Park.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Berzon will read from "Surviving Madness" at 7 p.m. Aug. 11 at
Skylight Books, 1818 N. Vermont Ave.</TE>

<LD>THE SILENCE OF THE RAIN</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Luiz Alfredo Garcia-Roza</LD>
<TE>   Translated by Benjamin Moser</TE>
<TE>   Henry Holt</TE>
<TE>   264 pages, $24</TE>
<TE>   Readers who like their thrillers to possess something beyond a
fast-paced, tricky plot will find much to marvel over in Luiz Alfredo
Garcia-Roza's "The Silence of the Rain." A bestselling novelist who
lives in Rio de Janeiro, Garcia-Roza has written a crime trilogy,
with the last two installments also slated to be translated into
English. In typical thriller fashion, this novel opens with what
police assume to be a murder, in this case, of a corporate executive
named Ricardo Carvalho. But the crime scene appears nearly pristine
to Inspector Espinosa, the quirky and contemplative detective
assigned to the case, who, like most of the story's other characters,
becomes as intriguing as the crime itself.</TE>
<TE>   Something of a literary buff, the divorced Espinosa spends a good
deal of time mulling over the intricacies of character, both those he
finds in literature and in real life. Despite his idiosyncrasies,
Espinosa never comes off as a mere caricature of the offbeat
detective; rather, he reminds us that policemen may also be as
complex and as ordinary as anyone else. After ruminating over the
possible scenarios at the crime scene, Espinosa decides to pay
Carvalho's widow a visit. During one of their early conversations,
Bia Vasconcelos notices the detective's interest in her painting
supplies and asks if he knows much about art:</TE>
<TE>   " 'Not really ... unless, like Thomas De Quincey, you consider
murder one of the fine arts.' He added: 'Have you read Thomas De
Quincey?</TE>
<TE>   " 'I'm afraid not, Inspector. What did he write about?</TE>
<TE>   " 'About crime and his experiments with opium. He had a real
passion for murder, though he himself was a very mild mannered
Englishman who wouldn't have hurt a fly. He wrote about murder; he
didn't practice it himself.' "</TE>
<TE>   Bia finds Espinosa's comments disconcerting because she is
accustomed to thinking that the average Brazilian cop is a dunce. But
as this scene develops, it becomes clear that Bia's discomfort with
hazy class boundaries might trouble her more than any genuine feeling
of guilt over her husband's death.</TE>
<TE>   Espinosa's investigation becomes more complicated when he finds
himself attracted to two of the women involved: Bia and Alba Antunes,
the owner of a local gym who also happens to be the girlfriend of
Julio Azevedo, the man who was seen having a beer with Bia at a local
club on the night of her husband's death.</TE>
<TE>   Predictable as these love tangles may sound, Garcia-Roza carries
them off with panache. His success in depicting a smitten murder
detective arises from his capacity to reveal character well beneath
the surface. Espinosa spends nearly as much time mulling the
subtleties of these two women's personalities as he does trying to
solve the crime. But we never feel that his attractions cause
Espinosa to shirk his duties. Rather, puzzling out the easily
observable and more hidden natures of Bia and Alba assists him in
puzzling out the possibilities of Carvalho's death.</TE>
<TE>   When Espinosa contemplates the various players in his
investigation, he finds himself especially drawn to thinking about
Julio, the man with ties to the two women Espinosa is drawn to: "I
couldn't deny a certain curiosity about Julio Azevedo. What made him
superior? Granted, he was good-looking, had a nice voice, was an
architect and a professor and had an answering machine that responded
in three languages. Curiosity was a kind of attraction. And yet I
didn't like him. Frightened, hesitant, romantically ambivalent,
professionally ambiguous, a careless seducer ... the picture was
strangely familiar .... It could have been Julio or it could have
been me."</TE>
<TE>   Espinosa's capacity for introspection and self-criticism breathes
fresh air into the crime novel genre, and goes a long way in
illustrating the old axiom about the importance of self-knowledge in
the solving of any sort of problem. Garcia-Roza's interest in the
interior of character also has the effect of lulling the reader; we
can almost forget that we are visiting a brutal world. But we do not
remain lulled forever, and the violence seems all the more shocking
for our attention having been quietly held elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Those readers who expect and require a certain quota of graphic
violence in their crime stories will doubtlessly feel gratified,
while some of the rest of us may wish Garcia-Roza could have pulled
off a conclusion with the same understated finesse of the rest of the
novel.</TE>

<HD>He's the Circus' Clowning Glory</HD>
<DH>Ringling's David Larible, praised for his antics, reflects
on a timeless craft</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There've been funny clowns and tragic clowns, heart-wrenching clowns
from Italian verismo opera and homicidal-maniac outer-space clowns
from Hollywood B movies.</LD>
<LD>   Then there's David Larible, the Italian-born "prince of laughter"
and star attraction of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus,
which has taken up residence at the Los Angeles Sports Arena through
Sunday. Appearing at a Tuesday night reception in his honor at the
Italian Cultural Institute in Westwood, Larible was everything one
might expect from a man who's been amusing friends and strangers
since childhood: spontaneous, intelligent, warm, un-self-important
and, thank goodness, funny. He'd left his red nose and oversized
shoes behind, but then, you can't have everything.</LD>
<LD>   A gentle-eyed, barrel-chested man who can look like Robin Williams
or Harvey Keitel, depending on his expression, Larible is one of the
best-known clowns alive. He has won practically every major award
that international clowndom bestows, including the Golden Clown,
presented to him by Prince Rainier of Monaco. He comes from a family
of circus and vaudeville performers, seven generations' worth, and is
said to play seven instruments and speak five languages.</LD>
<TE>   But on Tuesday, all he needed was his accented English to express
why clowning, to him, is not always a laughing matter. "Every time
people take themselves too seriously, big tragedy happen," said
Larible, 45, who wore a gray business suit and round-collared shirt.
"I don't think Hitler ever laugh at himself. Do you think Osama bin
Laden is going to laugh about his beard?"</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, the soiree had the look of one of those surreal,
inconsequential L.A. happenings. And, anyway, what was a professional
pratfaller doing at the Istituto Italiano di Cultura, a place that
normally devotes itself to toasting the glories of the Arte Povera
movement or the cinematic genius of Fellini, Pasolini and Antonioni?</TE>
<TE>   But as several of those present observed, clowning has deep
Italian roots, extending from the archetypal buffoons of medieval
commedia dell'arte, to the cuckolded antihero of Ruggero
Leoncavallo's 1892 opera "I Pagliacci," to comic Roberto Benigni's
Oscar-winning turn as a father who tries to joke his way through the
Holocaust in "Life Is Beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Some would even argue that Mussolini, the fascist dictator who
ruled Italy in the 1930s and early '40s, was one of the greatest
unbilled clowns in history, though nobody laughed very much at the
time. An exception was that notable English-born clown Charlie
Chaplin, who envisioned Mussolini as the buffoonish "Benzino
Napaloni" of the country "Bacteria" in his 1940 comic masterpiece
"The Great Dictator."</TE>
<TE>   Chaplin, Larible said, was part of a fine old tradition of clowns
who enjoyed success in the United States, including Emmett Kelly and
Lou Jacobs. "Then I think they started to do it a different way with
Ronald McDonald and Bozo."</TE>
<TE>   By L.A. standards, the occasion was low-key: first, cocktails and
hors d'oeuvres in the institute's courtyard, then a brief video
presentation on Larible's career, followed by a few remarks from the
guest of honor and a Q&amp;A with the audience. A speedy 90 minutes from
start to finish.</TE>
<TE>   Both Larible's wife, America, a Mexican-born trapeze artist, and
his mother, Lucina, were present. Now a Florida resident when he's
not on the road, Larible has been with Ringling Bros. for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Larible, who was born in the northern Italian town of Novara, said
he was, "of course, the class clown. I was always in trouble." Did he
study clowning or just learn it on the fly? "I'm not a big believer
in clowning school," he replied. "I don't think anybody can teach you
to be funny."</TE>
<TE>   At that moment, a woman who'd been listening to Larible and said
she teaches at the Second City improvisational comedy troupe chimed
in. "If tragedy is about a class war, maybe even against God,
clowning is the one remedy that can be treasured," she said.
"Clowning is about taking off the mask, which is the prison."</TE>
<TE>   Larible looked startled but nodded in agreement. "Fellini used to
say that the clown is the shadow of the human being," he said. And
clowns, he insisted, are not actors. "The clown always plays the same
character; the situation changes around him. Chaplin was a clown
because he always played the same character."</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Feld, producer and owner of Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp;
Bailey, said he recruited Larible after seeing him perform in Europe.
Larible's signature is coaxing audience members into the spotlight to
perform with him, and Feld said his star's genius lies in being able
to seize on a telling bit of body language to "produce humor out of
an Everyman." "He could pick up your pen and do something funny with
it," Feld said.</TE>
<TE>   Guests drifted into a small theater, draped with American and
Italian flags, to watch clips of Larible's performances. Afterward,
Larible recalled the first time he made an audience laugh. "That
sound was, for me, music," he said.</TE>
<TE>   An audience member asked if Larible would compare his style with
that of the Cirque du Soleil clowns. "I have more people in Cirque du
Soleil copy my routine than any other place," he replied evenly. It
only bothers him when others take credit for inventing his material,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   As the theater emptied, the crowd milled in the courtyard, where
fresh coffee in stout urns and biscotti awaited. The air had cooled,
and a soft glow suffused the scene as Larible obligingly posed for
snapshots.</TE>
<TE>   Talking with friends near a large piece of abstract sculpture,
Tina Fanelli-Moraccini, the institute's head of special
projects/cultural affairs, had a theory as to why Italy produces such
great clowns. "They're just giving, loving, friendly people," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, yes, love--the tonic that fuels the human comedy. Even those
who spend their lives making others smile are pained if they suffer
its deprivation. "When people laugh, they feel less lonely," Larible
had said earlier. "When people laugh at what you do, you feel love,
you know what I mean?"</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citrus needs to be watered more often than other fruit trees because
of the relatively shallow roots, but don't overdo it. Evenly spaced
irrigations are the key to preventing fruit drop and splitting. A
good soaking every two weeks is often recommended in summer. Leaves
yellowing between the veins in summer are a sign of chlorosis. Cure
by fertilizing with trace elements such as iron or zinc, available at
nurseries.</LD>
<LD>   Most plants don't need fertilizing in summer. Notable exceptions
include roses, warm-season lawns and summer annuals, which should be
fertilized monthly. Anything confined in a container also needs
regular monthly fertilizing.</LD>

<LD>Welcome to Southern California</LD>
<LD>   Southern California is home to many people who have come here from
other countries. Did you know that many of our plants have come from
other parts of the world too? One of these places is South Africa--a
country halfway around the world from us.</LD>
<LD>   Look at a map of the world and you'll see why South African plants
are happy living in Southern California. Even though the two places
are far apart, both are about the same distance from the equator and
both are near an ocean. The similar climate makes South African
plants feel welcome here.</LD>
<TE>   One plant, Lily of the Nile, has big clusters of purple or white
blossoms that look like fireworks at the top of strong stalks.
Another is the geranium with red and pink flowers and roundish
leaves. Both can be seen in flowerbeds all over Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The South African plant with which you might be most familiar is
the African daisy. Can you guess why it is also called the "freeway
daisy"? It gets its name because it often covers the sides of
freeways. Freeway daisies bloom in the summer and open their flowers
to the sun. On dark, foggy days, when the flowers are half closed,
you still will see color on the backs of the petals. Next time you're
riding in the car, look for bright purple flowers along the side of
the freeway. As you ride by, remember that freeway daisies, and their
other South African friends, are from a far-off land. Be sure you
tell them, "Welcome, and thank you for making Southern California
more beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Plants from South Africa and many other places around the world
grow at Descanso Gardens. For more information, call (818) 949-4200
or visit www.DescansoGardens.org.</TE>

Drive, in La Canada Flintridge.</TE>

<LD>* My favorite amusement park ride is Splash Mountain at Disneyland. I
love that feeling of terror you get when you're slowly going up the
long, tedious slope, hearing the screams of the log ahead of you.
That feeling is so exciting, especially when you ride it at night.
Although I hate the drop, the emotion of terror is worth everything.</LD>

<DH>Made-to-order furniture is the custom at the Cotton Box,
which also features a fabric emporium</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET EASTMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Personal taste. It's so, well, personal. How else can you explain the
appeal of a French chaise longue upholstered in Austin Powers'
lime-green velour? Or a distressed-finished armoire with modern
chrome hardware?</LD>
<LD>   People's expanding need to decorate to reflect their personalities
has created a spurt in stores that specialize in custom furniture,
which is a part of the $24-billion residential furniture industry in
the U.S., according to the American Furniture Manufacturers Assn. in
High Point, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   New homeowners needing to fill rooms, newlyweds looking for future
heirlooms and shoppers straining to match the style and stains of
existing pieces find that made-to-order fits their needs.</LD>
<TE>   The Cotton Box Home on Melrose is an example of showrooms that
give people the power to piece together the parts they see on the
floor--a cushion from one sofa, the arms from another--and have it in
their home in a few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Gavin Brodin opened the Cotton Box a year ago as a fabric store in
the shadow of heavyweights Diamond Foam &amp; Fabric Co. and the Silk
Trading Co. Soon he found that many of his customers inquired about
custom furniture as well, so last month he doubled his space to
12,000 square feet and stocked it with examples of traditional and
contemporary European-inspired furniture that can be made in his
downtown factory in two to six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The Cotton Box (a name that Brodin just liked the sound of but
that doesn't reflect the fabric selection) is separated into two
side-by-side stores: one for furniture and one for fabrics. (Brodin
made a name for himself in south London by opening a chain of fine
fabric stores.) The furniture gallery sells sofas, chairs, tables,
cabinets, beds and armoires--for clothes, electronics or
collectibles--that are made of solid wood with European hardware.</TE>
<TE>   The Cotton Box follows the tradition of showrooms offering room
vignettes to help people visualize how everything could look--in
style and scale--in a room, and to present complementary pieces and
accessories. But these setups are just suggestions, says Brodin, who
adds, "We can make anything in every style and stain."</TE>
<TE>   One vignette has a 7-foot Notting Hill-style sofa with a solid
alder frame, filled with white goose down and wrapped in
camel-colored ultra suede ($2,695). Boxing in the sofa is a
three-piece espresso-colored modular bookcase ($2,395). Also part of
the set are two oversized butter-soft black leather club chairs with
modern tufting ($1,795 each), a dark-grained coffee table ($995) and
a 5-by-8-foot swirl-patterned silk rug ($2,100). Completing the scene
are a silver modern Deco lamp (at $450, it's "the most expensive
table lamp in the store," says Brodin) as well as candles, imported
ceramic vases and frames.</TE>
<TE>   The fabric store houses more than 1,500 rolls, from classic silks,
linens and cottons to bolder woven animal prints and velvets from the
1960s and '70s. A Ratti paisley cotton from India sells for $69 a
yard while a Lismore red chenille is $23 a yard. Customers can work
with staff interior designers to create wall and window treatments,
bed linens, pillows and upholstered furniture.</TE>
<TE>   Set directors and party planners such as Donielle Baca of Paulette
Wolf Events &amp; Entertainment Inc. use the Cotton Box as an inspiration
point. Baca, who was looking for ideas for a large corporate event,
was caressing a roll of khaki-colored silk with pearl beading.
"Unique ideas have to come from somewhere and a fabric store is a
good place to start," she says.</TE>

<LD>Cherry Eyes made Annette imagine a miniature world with white mice
harnessed and pulling Cinderella's tiny pumpkin coach. It gave her an
idea.</LD>
<LD>   "What you doing?" Tyler said as Annette put Cherry Eyes into her
dollhouse. She put a cracker on the table. He got up on a tiny chair
and began nibbling it.</LD>
<LD>   "Let's see if Cherry Eyes likes my police car," Tyler said.</LD>
<TE>   Cherry Eyes hopped in and stuck his wiggly nose out the window.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in the back like a criminal," Annette said.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, he stole some cheese. RRRRROOOW." Tyler made a siren sound.</TE>
<TE>   When Annette returned Cherry Eyes to his cage he jumped on his
wheel and galloped away. She had another idea. Taking out the wheel,
she sat it in the tile hallway and put the mouse on it. He began
running and drove the wheel clickety clicking down the hall.</TE>
<TE>   "That's funny!" Tyler clapped his hands.</TE>
<TE>   When Cherry Eyes demonstrated his driving skill, the entire family
laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "Mouse power," Dad said.</TE>
<TE>   But Nadia was returning tomorrow, and Annette wanted to clean his
cage.</TE>
<TE>   She put Cherry Eyes in a shoe box in the bathroom and closed the
door.</TE>
<TE>   Then she scrubbed his cage. After it dried, she went for Cherry
Eyes, but the box was turned over and empty. Annette's heart beat
rapidly.</TE>
<TE>   "Tyler, did you use the bathroom a few minutes ago?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah."</TE>
<TE>   "Did you leave the door open?"</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe."</TE>
<TE>   "Cherry Eyes is gone! Where's Sammy?"</TE>
<TE>   "He was running around in here a minute ago."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, no! Chasing Cherry Eyes!"</TE>
<TE>   Annette and Tyler started calling Sammy. He was sleeping in
Annette's bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   "I just know Sammy caught him," Annette sobbed. She looked under
the bed, under and around the furniture, on the bed, the dresser.
That evening Mom and Dad helped look. "Sammy caught him and ...
and...." Annette couldn't say it.</TE>
<TE>   That night she cried and cried. Nadia's dear pet! Why hadn't she
protected him?</TE>
<TE>   Friday: How will Annette tell her friend what happened to Cherry
Eyes?</TE>

<HD>Laying It All on the Table</HD>
<DH>A simple quest for custom-made furniture evolves into a
complex--but satisfying--production</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN FREUDENHEIM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 8:30 on a Saturday morning, I was halfway to San Diego, talking on
my cell phone to my friend Boon-Keng Woo and totally recasting the
shape of a table she was designing for my family. For the third time.
That was when I realized how the process of creating custom furniture
can take over your life. And what a pleasure that can be.</LD>
<LD>   Over the years, I have met many people who were consumed with the
details of creation, certain that the difference between success and
failure can lie in the timing of a single beat in a song or the
finish on a floorboard of a room. I once sat in a studio while six
Disney animators spent 20 minutes discussing the psychological
implications of stripes versus flat color on a cartoon character's
bathing suit. I thought they were nuts.</LD>
<LD>   And then came my table. For almost two years, I have looked for
the perfect dining table, and in the months since we decided to
custom-build one, I have obsessed about every aspect of its shape,
materials, weight and color, changing my mind more than once on
almost every detail.</LD>
<TE>   What I have come to realize is that the decision-making process of
custom design can teach you a great deal about yourself. When you're
suddenly asked to narrow an infinity of possibilities into a single,
"perfect" piece of furniture, your taste comes into focus. And so do
the intimate associations you make with the things around you.</TE>
<TE>   This latter is particularly true for a dining room table, which
for many is the heart of a home. For our family of three, it is the
place where we eat our meals and read the newspaper. It is where my
daughter sometimes does her homework, where I pay bills when the desk
is too jampacked to work on, and where we sit down to talk--as a
family and with friends. Our life centers around the table, and not
incidentally, it is the first thing you encounter when you come in
our front door. In our house, the table sets the tone.</TE>
<TE>   But I never considered all this when I started my search. I
thought a good table was something you just buy on the fly. I began
stumbling toward my new consciousness only after, for the 10,000th
time, I had walked by and tried not to look at the walnut Ethan Allen
country dining set that my husband, Richard, bought secondhand for
$200 when he was still single. Throughout our marriage--more than a
decade--that has been our only dining set, a symbol of just one more
thing that needs to be replaced ... someday. And since our house is a
quasi-Modernist hillside cottage, with lots of floor-to-ceiling
windows, the old table's inappropriate rustic nature has been
impossible to miss from inside and out, even when camouflaged by
tablecloths.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the clunker had some essential good qualities that we
wanted to duplicate. It is round, a hefty 48 inches in diameter, and
expands wide enough with two leaves to seat eight (as long as nobody
breathes) without overtaking the room.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was, these days, extension tables are not round. Or
when tables are round and expandable, they're not as big as ours.
Richard graciously looked at hundreds of possibilities, rejected them
as I had, and then left me to pursue my own path, knowing that
ultimately he'd have (limited) veto power, if he felt strongly
enough, in the final moments.</TE>
<TE>   I wanted the new table to be natural wood with roughly the same
dimensions and expandability as the old one. And thus began the
downhill slide in the search for a ready-made.</TE>
<TE>   High- and low-end stores and the Internet yielded nothing to suit
my idea. Same for designer catalogs. Hadn't the late and very
prolific Charles and Ray Eames--two of the greatest mid-20th century
furniture designers--ever made a table like this, I hoped? No. Not an
extension table, although their design for a lovely round table with
a metal base gave me hope. Why couldn't that idea be expanded?</TE>
<TE>   I turned to Boon, a Rhode Island School of Design-trained former
furniture designer, who is now a full-time mom, for help. "Can you
design a table like that one, but that does this?" I said, pointing
to the Eames table in a catalog and gesturing with my hands to
indicate the shape. I found myself surprisingly inarticulate at
stating my vision, but Boon was too polite and too generous with her
time to say no; she was also too much of a friend to charge me for
her efforts.</TE>
<TE>   However, I now know what she knew then: I was asking a lot.
Designing a table is no small task.</TE>
<TE>   She shot a series of questions back at me: What kind of wood? How
thick do you want it? What kind of legs? Nothing was obvious. I
stumbled along, pointing to more pictures, realizing how much we take
for granted when we shop for ready-mades. We settled first on a round
maple design with straight polished-chrome legs. Boon made a drawing,
and I could tell she thought it was uninspired. In February, we took
her design to SDM Co., a manufacturer she'd worked with often, which
has a custom furniture shop on Washington Boulevard, near Fairfax.
Michael Cohen, whose father founded the 30-year-old family-owned
company, told me he could do it and gave me a quote of about $2,600.
The price seemed reasonable. I've seen extension tables that cost
anywhere from $600 for a low-end one, to $3,000 or much more,
depending on the size, wood and quality of the workmanship. Cohen
said they would do a mock-up on cardboard so I could get a sense of
the full-scale design before any wood was cut. I left thinking we
were on our way.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, as I was obsessing about the table to Boon one day, I
was leafing through a magazine and saw a picture of a table
completely unlike our design. Apologetically and spontaneously, I
said, "You know, if I had my dream table, it would be the one I'm
looking at now." She had the same magazine, and when I directed her
to the picture, she immediately sounded more excited than she had
been throughout the process. "That," she told me bluntly, "is a much
more interesting table." So we called SDM and told them we were
starting over.</TE>
<TE>   Even if we could have tracked down the table in the picture and
ordered one like it, I wasn't eager to do that at this point. My
family's needs were too specific, and besides, I wanted to see this
custom project through to the end. I liked the control over the
finished product that having it custom-made offered. We completely
trashed our old design for one that is almost square, but slightly
rounded on two sides. It's an unusual and elegant shape, with a
3-inch apron that rims the outer edge of the table and hides the
expansion mechanism. We were inspired, but not limited, by the
magazine picture, and because it was a pretty tiny image, we could
hardly have duplicated it anyway.</TE>
<TE>   We stuck with a maple veneer for the top because, Cohen explained,
these days a high-quality veneer over a medium-density fiberboard
core provides a durable and even finish without the random color
you'd get with solid wood. Instead of the metal legs, we now used
gracefully tapering triangular legs of solid maple. Boon told SDM
what we wanted verbally, we got a quote similar to the first and then
waited for the next cardboard mock-up. It came out all wrong.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, settling on the exact shape of the tabletop was
the hardest part, and that is what we were talking about when I was
driving to San Diego that day. I later did several sketches on
napkins that were enough to give Boon an idea. We'd been too
informal, trusting that our conversations were conveying enough
information to the builders to execute the design. So once again,
Boon sat down and did detailed drawings, which we faxed over. No
longer was this a casual conversation between friends. Belatedly, we
were becoming more professional about the job.</TE>
<TE>   After we'd signed off on the final mock-up, it took a couple weeks
for us to get the call to come see the completed table. Richard, Boon
and I went by SDM a couple of weeks ago, and seeing in three
dimensions what had been only an abstraction was, to me, completely
satisfying.</TE>
<TE>   Boon has told Richard and me that this table will change
everything, that nothing in our house will look the same once we have
it. Richard just laughs, and I nervously hope she isn't entirely
correct. I like most of our other furniture and want to keep it, and
anyway, buying all new furniture is not in our budget right now.</TE>
<TE>   But I find myself thinking of how this table will change the
atmosphere of our home and how it will make me proud to entertain. My
investment in its shape is a story I want to share, a symbol of
friendship past and future.</TE>

<LD>Nelly's "Nellyville" album tops the nation's album charts for the
third consecutive week, easily withstanding the challenge of the Red
Hot Chili Peppers' new "By the Way" collection, Nielsen SoundScan
reported Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The rapper's collection sold another 340,000 copies last week to
push its total to the 1.5 million mark. The Chili Peppers' album sold
282,000 copies to claim second place.</LD>
<LD>   Eminem's "The Eminem Show," which has now sold 4.1 million copies
since its release in late May, finished third last week with sales of
231,000 copies.</LD>
<TE>   Two other new releases joined the Peppers in the Top 10: the rock
group Counting Crows' "Hard Candy," which finished No. 5; and rapper
Styles' "A Gangster and a Gentleman," which ranked No. 6. The
remaining positions in the Top 10 were claimed by, in order: Avril
Lavigne, Irv Gotti, Josh Groban, Ashanti and Aerosmith.</TE>
<TE>   Nelly's hold on No. 1 is expected to end next week because the
Dave Matthews Band's new "Busted Stuff" got off to a strong start
Tuesday, its first day in stores, retailers said. Early projections
suggest the collection should top the half-million mark. The band's
last album sold 730,000 copies in its first week in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The remix version of Elvis Presley's 1968 single, "A Little Less
Conversation," remains No. 1 on the singles chart. The original
single only reached No. 69 on the charts.</TE>

<TE>   Sound Advice</TE>
<TE>   Red Hot Chili Peppers' "By the Way" (Warner Bros.). The collection
lacks the striking spareness of its "Californication," but the
arrangements are rich and often surprising, deploying strings, spacey
effects and acoustic stretches to vary the atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Nelly's "Nellyville" (Universal). The follow-up to the hugely
successful "Country Grammar" proves that the urban class-leap story
doesn't have to be hackneyed.</TE>
<TE>   Eminem's "The Eminem Show" (Aftermath/Interscope). What makes
Eminem an extraordinary blend of commercial appeal and artistic
accomplishment is that he can move from the darkness of "Cleaning Out
My Closet" to the catchiness of "Without Me."</TE>
<TE>   Avril Lavigne's "Let Go" (Arista). Girl-rock meets boy-rock in
this debut from a 17-year-old Canadian waif with attitude.</TE>
<TE>   The Dave Matthews Band's "Busted Stuff" (RCA). Matthews has
retreated even further into the sanctuary of his own sound, if that's
possible, resulting in a gorgeous sonic flow with absolutely nothing
to say.</TE>
<TE>   The Vines' "Highly Evolved" (Capitol). This highly touted
Australian rock group's debut album alternates between piquant and
sweet, like Skittles for your ears.</TE>

<LD>"I'm going to be acting and singing with people who think the way I
do about acting ... working with people who think like me. I'm not
used to that. I value music so, so much. To me, music is almost like
religion."</LD>
<LD>   Danielle Withers, 18, of Mason, Ohio, was waxing enthusiastic
about her upcoming trip to Hollywood, where she and others like her
will perform at the John Raitt Theatre. As the newly formed Cappies
Hollywood Theater company, the young actors--award-winning high
school theater artists from Ohio, Oregon, Texas and Virginia--will
present three musicals, staged by theater professionals, starting
Friday and running through Aug. 3.</LD>
<LD>   "It's pretty much an opportunity of a lifetime," said cast member
Jonathan Matthews, 18, of Springfield, Ore.</LD>
<TE>   To be chosen for the Cappies Hollywood Theater company, Withers,
Matthews and eight other teens competed against other Cappie Award
winners--theater arts students recognized for excellence by high
school theater critics. The critics and performers are participants
in the Critics and Awards Program, a 3-year-old, national mentoring
and peer review program sponsored by the Capitol Steps political
satire troupe.</TE>
<TE>   Capitol Steps and Cappies co-founder William Strauss, whose most
recent book, with co-author Neil Howe, is the sociological study
"Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation," saw the Cappies as a
way to counterbalance the negative press teenagers received following
the tragedy at Columbine High School in Colorado. He also wanted to
give recognition to students in theater arts who often "don't have
much attention paid to them in relation to sports, for example.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal we had was to try to provide more positive community
celebration of the great things that teenagers do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The young actors will strut their stuff in two original musicals,
written by Strauss and scored by veteran composers Bo Ayars and
Steven Rosenhaus.</TE>
<TE>   "MaKiddo," a comic take-off on Gilbert &amp; Sullivan's "The Mikado,"
satirizes high school stresses over grades, standardized tests and
college applications. "Freethemusic.Com," said Strauss, "is about
high-tech teenagers who like to upload and download songs and a big
entertainment company that wants to stop them."</TE>
<TE>   In its final week, the company, joined by veteran Broadway star
John Raitt and "surprise guests," will present "A Tribute to Richard
Rodgers," a musical revue celebrating the centennial of the
composer's birth, which they also will perform at the Beverly Hills
Civic Center Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   The Cappies joined with the Hollywood-based American Center for
Music and Theater this year to create the Cappies Hollywood Theater.
Next year, the center plans to expand the program into a larger
summer stock company with actors 18 and older.</TE>
<TE>   "High school theater is the real youth culture," Strauss said.
"That's where they're out there, doing something, shaping something.
And what they're doing is so much more illuminating than what you see
on TV shows or movies."</TE>
<TE>   "People at a young age are not always taken seriously as
performers," said Paul Gleason, American Center for Music and
Theater's co-founder and general director. "We had one person call
this a summer camp. It ain't no summer camp. They are working 12
hours a day; they are doing three full shows and performing for
legitimate audiences. They have [theater and film professionals]
advising them.</TE>
<TE>   "These are not kids. From this moment, we call them young working
professionals."</TE>
<TE>   Withers, who will attend Howard University in the fall with a
double major in music education and musical theater, will
"definitely" pursue it as a career. "Maybe be Vanessa Williams doing
'Into the Woods' someday. I want to be a star."</TE>
<TE>   "MaKiddo," John Raitt Theatre, 6520 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood,

<TE>   In a city well-known for creating animation, LACMA hosts a new
exhibition that turns animation on its ear. South African artist
William Kentridge, who is the subject of a survey opening there
Sunday, composes short animated films from thousands of gritty
charcoal drawings. The drawings are made and erased in the filmmaking
process and often address the complex politics and history of his
homeland. In total, the survey will include 11 animated films, more
than 60 drawings, two sculptural installations and video presentation
of theater and opera productions that Kentridge designed.</TE>

<LD>8:30pm Dance</LD>
<LD>   In nine dances that explore the dynamics of women's relationships,
choreographer Arianne MacBean and her Big Show Company turn a poem by
C.K. Williams titled "This Happened" into an evening of contemporary
movement theater. Praised by The Times for what one reviewer called
"provocative thought and deft physicality," the 3-year-old, locally
based company now has a repertory of 20 works and specializes in
multidisciplinary performance events. Some sections of "This
Happened," for example, include spoken and projected texts. Expect
taped music and live percussion, plus video, along with a complex
architectural arrangement of white walls and cubes. Unifying all the
elements, MacBean says, is the theme of friendship--between dancers,
between choreographer and dancer, and between women.</LD>
<LD>   Arianne MacBean and the Big Show Company in "This Happened,"
Highways Performance Space, 1651 18th St., Santa Monica, 8:30 p.m.
Also Friday and Saturday, 8:30 p.m. $13 (students); $15. (310)
315-1459.</LD>
<TE>   8:30pm Jazz</TE>
<TE>   His 1960s musical forays with John Coltrane are the stuff of jazz
legend--furious, creative innovation that led audiences to new and
unfamiliar musical frontiers--and saxophonist Pharoah Sanders has
managed to carry on that avant-garde tradition into the succeeding
years without sacrificing his intensity. The jazz veteran makes his
annual visit to L.A. this week.</TE>
<TE>   Pharoah Sanders Quartet, Catalina Bar &amp; Grill, 1640 N. Cahuenga
Blvd., Hollywood, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m. Also Friday and Saturday, 8:30
and 10:30 p.m.; Sunday, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. $18 to $25. (323)
466-2210.</TE>
<TE>   8pm Music</TE>
<TE>   American violinist Leila Josefowicz returns to the Hollywood Bowl,
this time with veteran conductor-violinist-violist Jaime Laredo, a
moving force in North American chamber music over the past 40 years.
The two string players share the spotlight in Mozart's Sinfonia
Concertante, K. 364, and in Bach's Double Concerto. Laredo leads the
Los Angeles Philharmonic in Mendelssohn's beloved "Italian" Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Philharmonic, Hollywood Bowl, 2301 N. Highland Ave.,
Hollywood, 8 p.m. $1 to $76. (323) 850-2000.</TE>
<TE>   10pm Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   Alt-country musician and storyteller Jim White started calling his
new tour "Man With Machines" as a joke, but the phrase stuck. Instead
of just strumming his guitar while singing his songs, which look deep
into the psyche of the American South, the Pensacola, Fla.-reared
maverick will accompany himself with tape loops, audio samples and
other electronic bells and whistles for shows tonight and Friday at
the AlterKnit Lounge in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Jim White, AlterKnit Lounge, Knitting Factory Hollywood, 7021
Hollywood Blvd., 10 p.m. Also Friday, 10 p.m. $12. (323) 463-0204.</TE>
<TE>   all day Movies</TE>
<TE>   In "Annie Hall," the spider Woody Allen had to deal with was only
the size of a Buick. In "Eight Legged Freaks," engineer David
Arquette and sheriff Kari Wuhrer do battle with arachnids the size of
SUVs, the outgrowth of a toxic-waste spill near their rural mining
town. The carnivorous bugs, clear descendants of the B-movie monsters
of the '50s, terrorize the small town's inhabitants, including
Scarlett Johansson, Doug E. Doug, Rick Overton and Scott Terra.</TE>
<TE>   "Eight Legged Freaks," rated PG-13 for sci-fi violence, brief
sexuality and language, opened Wednesday in general release.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Armed with a seductive accent and a keen eye for the humorous side of
life, Jamaican-born actor-writer Debra Ehrhardt crafts a warmhearted
narrative out of her lifelong struggle to understand the opposite
sex--and the unexpected sources of support and strength she found
along the way--in "Invisible Chairs" at the Lee Strasberg Creative
Center.</LD>
<LD>   In this debut staging for the Group at Strasberg, director Laraine
Mestman plays to Ehrhardt's performance strengths--her attractive,
charismatic presence and relaxed, confessional delivery. But
Ehrhardt's insights, while important in the context of her own
journey, don't offer much in the way of groundbreaking
revelations--this is essentially a solo performance as therapy
session, albeit an entertaining one that deals with problems many of
us can relate to.</LD>
<LD>   To further personalize the event, Ehrhardt enlists the onstage
support of her real-life, 18-year-old son, Danny, who gamely fills in
some of the supplemental characters (most successfully his own);
hence the billing as a "one-and-a-half" person show.</LD>
<TE>   The central issue Ehrhardt confronts knows no geographic or racial
boundaries--her compulsive need to keep the men in her life at a
distance. The prospect of intimacy was so terrifying that she avoided
men to whom she was passionately attracted, instead marrying someone
she knew she would never fall in love with. Predictably, the union
didn't last, but the birth of Danny meant she could no longer keep
ducking understanding and emotional ties with the male she would have
to raise.</TE>
<TE>   Blocking her path stands the forbidding figure of her father, an
irresistibly charming salesman with feet of clay. Through
remembrances of his emotional rebuffs of the young Debra, and
re-enactments of his disastrous marriage to her mother, the narrative
skillfully grounds the origins of Ehrhardt's failed relationships in
"the daddy problem" she had coped with all her life.</TE>
<TE>   It falls to Danny to unearth a poignant discovery about her
father's past that allows Ehrhardt to break her own cycle of
emotional distancing in this compact, unpretentious celebration of
the power of understanding and forgiveness.</TE>

Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 5 p.m. Ends Aug. 11. $17-19.

<DH>Robbie Rist will play with 16 bands during a 17-day
festival. Now, can we just forget that 'Brady Bunch'- Cousin Oliver
stuff?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN BRONSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seconds after the calamitous final performance by the eminently
likable but unfortunately named pop band the Masticators, Robbie Rist
was a shambles.</LD>
<LD>   Guitars had been thrown, drumsticks hurtled. The small, raucous
crowd at the Galaxy Theatre in Santa Ana pleaded for an encore,
unaware that on this night last summer, the Los Angeles
foursome--like the relationship between its charismatic drummer,
Rist, and prepossessing frontwoman, Lisa Mychols--was breaking up.</LD>
<LD>   Rist bridged an awkward moment with an a cappella interlude, and
the band soldiered through one more number. Then he marched offstage,
disheveled and emotionally drained, with the hollow eyes of a man
you'd reckon would head straight into seclusion.</LD>
<TE>   But the next night the former child actor, drummer, guitarist,
vocalist, hyperkinetic showman and 5-foot, 6-inch power-pop warrior
was sitting in with another band, bouncing around as if he just
returned from a five-star first date.</TE>
<TE>   "Music is the only thing that has gotten me through everything,"
Rist says, waving his hand at the travails of being a fringe player
in the entertainment business. "And when it comes right down to it, I
just want to play."</TE>
<TE>   And play he does. Besides his primary focus as guitarist for the
Andersons, Rist is working on a new project with Steve Barton of the
'80s new-wavers Translator and filling in with Cockeyed Ghost, the
Last, Cosmo Topper and myriad other scrappy blue-collar bands that
populate the L.A. community.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, at the 17-day, 180-band International Pop Overthrow
festival that begins Friday, Rist is scheduled to perform with no
fewer than 16 acts.</TE>
<TE>   "He's ubiquitous, and that word applies in a number of ways," says
John Borack, a musician and journalist who has tracked local pop.
"He's been a magnet for the whole L.A. pop scene."</TE>
<TE>   Now if folks would simply put "The Brady Bunch" behind them.</TE>
<TE>   Cousin Oliver is 38 now, and he thinks you should get out more.
Walk the dog, check out the neighborhood garage band--anything except
sprout roots in front of the television.</TE>
<TE>   Rist laughs at his three-decade conundrum: When he was 9, he
appeared in the final six episodes of "The Brady Bunch," kicking off
a career that would ensure him a degree of celebrity, at the expense
of a few degrees of normalcy.</TE>
<TE>   "I entered the cultural zeitgeist, and it wasn't even 'Donna Reed'
or 'All in the Family,' " he says. "But think about how big that is.
I've been recognized, in Italy.... Let something I achieved myself
receive that kind of notoriety."</TE>
<TE>   Not that it's easy living up to constant Cousin Oliver
expectations, especially if you've gotten on with your life.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember on a long road trip talking to Robbie about the Cousin
Oliver thing," says Walter Clevenger, a veteran pop musician with
whom Rist has performed, "and I came away thinking, 'I wouldn't want
any kid to go through that.' "</TE>
<TE>   Rist has moved on, with an attitude chirpier than you'd expect
from a guy who totes around his music gear in a Ford Aerostar van
with more than 300,000 miles on it.</TE>
<TE>   After his early work in TV, which included a few episodes as Ted
Baxter's son on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," Rist had sundry small-
and big-screen roles and has done extensive voice work, notably as
Michelangelo in the "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" movies.</TE>
<TE>   "But music has always been the one thing that's mine," he says.</TE>
<TE>   *Rist didn't plunge into music in earnest until he was almost 30,
but his influences were in place long before. "When I was 14, I saw
the Knack and said, 'Holy cow, I wanna do that,' " he says.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, 2 1/2 decades later that brand of pop is about as cool
as plaid pants. Still, fashion fascism does not stop Rist from
championing the cause or pontificating on perceived crimes against
melody.</TE>
<TE>   "High hip quotient I have no time for," Rist says. "There's a
wealth of music out there that people have never heard because they
were too busy buying Trent Reznor records that were created in a
vacuum. That's not music, it's collage, and I learned in kindergarten
that collages belong on the refrigerator.</TE>
<TE>   "But then again," he adds, laughing, "I have half-baked theories
about everything."</TE>
<TE>   "That's Robbie," says David Bash, the International Pop Overthrow
promoter. "He's very precocious, just like Cousin Oliver was. Part of
his charm is that he still has that precocity. He can get away with
saying things that other people couldn't.</TE>
<TE>   "But even so, he's not as impressed with himself as other people
are with him."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Rist's skill at any number of instruments--and the energy
he brings to the stage--make him a welcome addition to many bands.</TE>
<TE>   The Florida power-pop outfit Nice Guy Eddie needed a bass player
on its trips to the West Coast. Frontman Chris Jackson found Rist.</TE>
<TE>   "I sent him a tape of our songs, but I don't think he listened to
it," Jackson says. "We practiced twice. He was like, 'Just go ahead,
I'll get it.' And he did."</TE>
<TE>   "And he's not just a quick study," says Ken West of the L.A. band
Receiver. "He gets 100% behind it. He more than just produced our
record--he literally grabbed my hand and told me what we were gonna
do. It's a complete mystery to me why Robbie's not just huge."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe when the cultural spinning wheel stops on skinny ties and
Rickenbackers again, he will be. "I'm not as big as Bill Gates," Rist
says, "but sometimes I bet he says, 'I wish there wasn't so much
stuff involved."</TE>

<LD>Aloha to the Lava Lounge, which celebrates its ninth birthday tonight
with its annual hot Lava Luau. Senor Amor is DJ, so you know Cupid's
gonna be in the hiz-ous.</LD>
<LD>   We hear that the downtown Standard hotel's hottest scene is Sunday
afternoon, when DJs spin on its rooftop. Top that.</LD>
<LD>   Punk of the Week award goes to Greg Hetson. I ran into the Bad
Religion guitarist in Ventura at the Vans Warped Tour. He was
cruising around on a little girl's bicycle with pink sparkly tassels,
wearing an REO Speedwagon T-shirt. Now that's hard core.</LD>
<TE>   Speaking of hard core, the New York band the Casualties shredded
so hard on a Warped Tour side stage, I'm still blistering.</TE>
<TE>   Hey now, it's not too late to book a flight to Cabo San Lucas for
the Labor Day weekend Mextravaganza festival, which includes
performances by Jane's Addiction, Pennywise, Ozomatli, the Vandals,
Cypress Hill and many more.  eforeAndale! The Lucky Duck restaurant on La
Brea just debuted the Lucky Duck Bar, a lovely lounge adjacent to the
restaurant. Its specialty is fresh juice cocktails. Sweet.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of sweet, the Hunns, featuring the rock 'n' roll dream
team of Corey Parks and Duane Peters, is playing at the Viper Room on
July 29. Shake it; don't break it now.</TE>

<HD>Shinozaki Takes a Refreshing, Direct Approach to 'Eroica'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A fresh breeze blew across Cahuenga Pass Tuesday night. It signaled
not only the balminess of the Southern California evening, but the
exuberance coming off the podium at the Hollywood Bowl, where Yasuo
Shinozaki conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic in a bracing and,
until the finale, immaculate performance of Beethoven's "Eroica"
Symphony.</LD>
<LD>   The familiar piece, for decades one of this orchestra's
specialties, sounded new under Shinozaki's earnest, serious and
direct approach. He concentrated on the exhilaration and
single-mindedness of the opening movement, stressed the terror and
grief that make the Funeral March the core of the work, lightened up
for the jolliness of the Scherzo. Throughout, the orchestra played
brightly and achieved genuine transparency.</LD>
<LD>   When the last movement arrived, the Philharmonic's assistant
conductor seemed to run out of concentration, and, one suspects,
rehearsal time, because the focus went out of this reading and what
had been tight suddenly turned sloppy. At the end, it was as if he
hit a brick wall.</LD>
<TE>   The first part of this evening was less surprising. It began
promisingly with Karen Tanaka's gently striking "Guardian Angel," an
11-minute meditation scored for an ethereal combination of strings,
clarinet, percussion and harp.</TE>
<TE>   Mozart's E-flat Concerto for Two Pianos, K. 365, was the
centerpiece, played by Emanuel Ax, a regular visitor here for a
quarter-century, and his wife, Yoko Nozaki, in her Philharmonic
debut. They gave the work a solid and charming reading, aided
comfortably by Shinozaki and the orchestra.</TE>

<HD>Circus Tradition: Adhering to It Here, Updating It There</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIBBY SLATE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you think it's tough being a horse whisperer, consider Sara
Houcke's job. She talks to tigers. The seventh-generation circus
performer, billed as Sara the Tiger Whisperer, is a star of the 132nd
edition of Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, which opened
Wednesday at the Los Angeles Sports Arena and moves to the Anaheim
Pond next week.</LD>
<LD>   Houcke, born in Torquay, England, is just one of Ringling's
featured artists who is trying to break through conventional notions
of circus performances. She had worked with camels, zebras, horses
and elephants, but in 1999 she decided to enter the traditionally
male domain of the tiger cage.</LD>
<LD>   "A man in the ring is a little bit more of a macho type," says
Houcke, 25, who uses vocal commands with nine tigers and also does an
elephant act. "With me, it's more like the tigers are my children
than anything else."</LD>
<TE>   It took a year to fully earn the big cats' respect, she adds. "I
have a great relationship with them. I can pet them, kiss their
noses, put my head on their shoulders. I feed them meat out of my
hand rather than from a stick. If I'm not feeling well, they totally
know it."</TE>
<TE>   Have the tigers ever harmed Houcke? "No," she says. "They're big
pussycats toward me."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, David Larible quotes Fellini, reads Dickens and speaks
five languages. Raised in Verona, Italy, he also happens to be a
world-renowned clown and another seventh-generation circus performer
trying to break with tradition. Rather than white-face makeup and
slapstick, Larible's act is inspired by centuries-old European
performing traditions.</TE>
<TE>   Larible bases his comedy on his homeland's commedia dell'arte, a
16th century theater form that combined improvisation with stock
characters and scenarios, and on the European version of the Auguste
clown, a naturalistic Everyman whose makeup allows the performer's
own facial features to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   "When you say 'clown,' people think of Bozo and McDonald's; that's
what I'm trying to fight," says Larible. "When you do clowning the
right way, it's an art."</TE>
<TE>   Also in the ring this year is the hand-balancing act performed by
Ringling novice Mei Ling. Almost all hand balancing is done by men.
Ling knows of only two other women--in Europe--who perform tricks as
difficult as hers. And she knows of no one else, male or female, who
executes them atop a rotating motorcycle.</TE>
<TE>   Ling, 23, a third-generation circus performer and native of Berne,
Switzerland, began hand balancing at 15. "My teacher gave me his
routine, with choreography and music," Ling says. Her dad suggested
adding the motorcycle.</TE>
<TE>   From a platform 10 feet to 15 feet above the bike, Ling balances
her body primarily on one hand during her five-minute act.</TE>
<TE>   "Hand balancing is about strength," says the 5-foot-2-inch
performer.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why it's more of a male routine. It's a cool feeling. It
makes me feel powerful."</TE>
<TE>   Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, through Sunday at the
Los Angeles Sports Arena, 3939 S. Figueroa St. $13-$35. (213)
748-6136 or Ticketmaster: (213) 480-3232. Wednesday-Aug. 4 at the
Anaheim Pond, 2695 E. Katella Ave. Tickets $13-$15. (714) 704-2500 or

<HD>Making the Scene ... in Glendale?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HEIDI SIEGMUND CUDA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a Wednesday night in Glendale, and the Scene Bar is where it's
at. They've got two turntables and a microphone and Sam Velde from
Bluebird is DJing--rocking the house with heavy helpings of the
Stooges, the Who and the Jam. The last thing you'd expect to find
midweek in Glendale is a hot nightclub with Eastside hipsters packing
the place as if it were the Short Stop on a weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Well, it's not so surprising when you consider that Short Stop
co-owner Dave Neupert, who transformed the legendary cop bar into
Echo Park's favorite hang, is the guy behind the Scene.</LD>
<LD>   I thought he was just being cheeky when he told me his new
Glendale club was called the Scene Bar, but he says that's been the
name for 40 years. And over those years, the Colorado Boulevard
watering hole had decayed into something out of "Barfly." It had
become a community blight, but Neupert and manager Carl Lofgren saw
potential.</LD>
<TE>   One of a band of smart young barkeeps--Mitchell Frank of
Spaceland/The Echo and Bobby Green of the Bigfoot Lodge among
them--Neupert continues to push the geographical boundaries of where
scenesters are willing to go for fun.</TE>
<TE>   First rule: If you're going to make people drive to Glendale for
night life, you have to be willing to provide it. Even industry
players who live in Glendale may be leery of opting to spend the
night in their own neighborhood when Hollywood, Silver Lake and the
Atwater draw, the Bigfoot Lodge, are short night-crawls.</TE>
<TE>   But the 4-week-old Scene Bar has a plan: It's brought Silver Lake
and Hollywood to you. And its beaten-down roadhouse look gives it a
dusty, Southern appeal, as if you've just landed in Texas and Patrick
Swayze is kicking someone's rear out back. The interior is simple,
and the backyard--with a circular barn and a huge dirt area--looks
like the Hootenanny in miniature.</TE>
<TE>   Neupert and his partners, Kevin Regan and Michael Barnes, have
stocked the place with DJs seven nights a week and are filling the
summer calendar with beer bashes and live music. They're also booking
bands from the Eastside scene, the psychedelic rock quartet Bluebird
among them.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of Bluebird, the night Velde teams up with Buddyhead's
Travis Keller to spin some records, has turned into one of the
coolest things to do on a Wednesday. Last week, everyone was
representing L.A.-style and getting treated to excellent rock 'n'
roll by the Rolling Stones, the Saints and Stone Roses, a
sweet-smelling blend. The guests took advantage of the club's two
pool tables and rounded bar.</TE>
<TE>   One way the Scene Bar is very unlike its Hollywood counterparts:
Despite its residential location, its owners haven't received any
noise complaints and, in fact, have been embraced by the community.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, Glendale rocks.</TE>
<TE>   The Scene Bar, 806 E. Colorado Blvd., Glendale, (818) 241-7029. 21
and older. Open daily 6 p.m.-2 a.m.</TE>

<AU>BARBARA HANSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The greatest challenge in eating at All Family Restaurant may be
finding it. If you can read Korean, no problem. You go to a mall on
Crenshaw Boulevard just south of Olympic Boulevard and look for the
shop with a red sign. The name does appear in English on the door,
but it's too small to be seen from the parking lot.</LD>
<LD>   Then you can relax, because there's no language problem inside
this plain little restaurant. The menu is written in Korean, but the
waitress quickly brings a table card with clear-cut English
translations like "steamed dumplings" or "fried dumplings." This is
important, because dumplings (mandu) are the lead dish here. There
are miniature dumplings, giant dumplings and in-between-sized
dumplings; dumplings in soup and dumplings in stew; even sacks of
dumplings to take out.</LD>
<LD>   The steamed dumplings, brought to the table on a steamer inset
lined with white cloth, are tender. The fried dumplings are light,
crisp and not a bit greasy. Both are filled with pork, beef, garlic
and green onion and accompanied by a soy dipping sauce. Hat-shaped
steamed dumplings that contain kimchi as well as meat (kimchi mandu)
don't appear on the English menu but are worth asking for. They come
in shi nu nim soup or on a platter with slivered daikon in the
center.</LD>
<TE>   All Family Restaurant deals in dough, you could say. In addition
to dumplings, it has noodles and flat oval rice cakes. You can even
have dumplings and rice cakes together, in a hearty bowl of broth
with scrambled egg, spinach and green onions. This dish is lighter
than you might expect. It isn't spicy either, though Koreans have a
reputation for lacing food with hot pepper. (A pot of kimchi on the
table serves that purpose here.)</TE>
<TE>   In South Korea, college kids snack on a chewy rice cake called
unbi. Women taking a break from shopping also eat unbi (spelled "eun
bees" on the English menu). This extraordinary dish is a gaudy red
(the color of the sauce) and a little spicy, as well as sweet. These
rice cakes are tubular, and they're combined with triangles of
delicately flavored fish cake.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the noodles are hand-cut, with a good, chewy bite to them.
Slim potato starch noodles are also chewy. To put it in Italian
terms, all the noodles are al dente.</TE>
<TE>   A friend who doesn't eat meat ordered hand-cut noodles in anchovy
broth. Surprise: The broth was subtle, not based on strong-tasting
Caesar salad-type anchovies. Other noodle soups include beef, chicken
or kimchi.</TE>
<TE>   Cold bean soup noodles are as plain as can be, spruced up only
with a pinch of sesame seeds. The creamy broth is based on soy milk,
not dairy cream. This old-time dish is so bland you may want to add
salt or soy sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Sobang nim (hand-cut noodles in hot anchovy broth with seafood)
has shrimp, crab, clams, mussels and fish cake as well as strips of
zucchini, potatoes and eggs. The pretty slice of fish cake is notched
at the edges. A pink line swirls through the center.</TE>
<TE>   Tchol myon is a beautiful cold dish combining firm, narrow potato
starch noodles with a sweet, spicy red sauce, like the one on the
rice cakes. At first you don't see the noodles, because they're at
the bottom of a bowl, covered with a mound of finely shredded green
and red cabbage. A few strands of cucumber and carrot add color, and
a hard-boiled egg half sits on top. To make it easier to eat, the
waitress clips through the cabbage with scissors. The English menu
doesn't mention this dish, but many Koreans order it.</TE>
<TE>   All Family serves a few dishes apart from noodles and dumplings.
The spicy red sauce for stir-fried squid with vegetables has a subtle
grilled flavor. On one side is cabbage topped with sweet, pale pink,
creamy dressing, like a Korean Thousand Island. A small bowl of white
rice also accompanies this dish. The menu lists pork cutlet, and a
Korean friend who could read the names of dishes posted on the wall,
says there is bulgogi (barbecued beef) too.</TE>
<TE>   A frosty pitcher of cold barley tea comes with whatever you order.
Pale gold and almost as light in flavor as water, it's a nice
alternative to regular iced tea and pairs well with these assertive
dishes.</TE>
<TE>   All Family Restaurant, #B, 1032 Crenshaw Blvd., L.A. (323)
935-2724. Lunch and dinner from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Mondays through
Saturdays. No alcohol. Parking lot. Visa and MasterCard. Dinner for
two, $12 to $20.</TE>
<TE>   * What to get: steamed or fried dumplings, kimchi dumplings, rice
cake dumpling soup, hand-cut noodles in broth, sobang nim, unbi (eun
bees), tchol myon.</TE>

<LD>The House of Blues was howling the night Los Lobos played. A packed
and eager crowd--from young Latino college couples to middle-aged
Anglo hipsters--had come to see the legendary Chicano roots-rock band
perform last month at the West Hollywood club.</LD>
<LD>   But for one unexpected moment before the band took the stage, fans
got a rare glimpse of the percolating promise of the Latin
alternative music scene in Southern California. Quetzal, the fine
Chicano fusion band from East L.A., was finishing its set when Los
Lobos' David Hidalgo and guitarist Raul Pacheco of the world-fusion
group Ozomatli joined them for their finale. The enhanced band
delivered a thrilling rendition of the classic "El Cascabel,"
rejuvenating the old folk tune from Veracruz with an electrified
intensity cultivated in barrios ranging from El Sereno to San
Fernando.</LD>
<LD>   Many fans might have missed the meaning of the moment. But for
L.A.'s underground army of anonymous Latin musicians, it encapsulated
decades of dreams and aspirations, which suddenly seemed attainable.</LD>
<TE>   These three bands--Los Lobos, Quetzal and Ozomatli--today
represent the best of a new wave of Latin alternative bands working
throughout Southern California. It has taken two generations to put
this kind of Latino talent on stage here simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   But for the few bands that have made a name in the business, there
are dozens of other unheralded outfits practicing in their garages,
from Oxnard to Anaheim. They save money to make their own recordings
and pay for their own tours. They have no managers and no record
deals. But what they have in abundance is energy and the drive to
have their music heard.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California has witnessed an explosion of bands in the
Latin alternative genre in the past decade. The scene is heating up
so fast, says the normally understated Hidalgo, that he can't keep
track. It reminds him of the 1980s heyday of the L.A. rock scene when
Los Lobos shared bills and friendships with bands like X and the
Blasters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like it was in the '80s, when we played around town and we'd
go to each other's shows and support each other," says Hidalgo, whose
two sons play in a local punk band. "It's alive again, but it's more
in the Latino community now."</TE>
<TE>   The bands are everywhere, yet they are invisible to the mainstream
record business. They get no radio play and little publicity. They
are rarely offered a chance to open for the big-name alternative
bands from Latin America they idolize.</TE>
<TE>   To find the local bands, you have to search them out. You'll see
them at community halls in Boyle Heights and dark coffeehouses near
Venice. They play in barrio bars next to trash-strewn lots in El
Sereno, and in a low-rent mini-mall in Westchester. Occasionally,
they'll pop up at trendy clubs on the Sunset Strip, but mostly on
weeknights when the venues need to fill their calendars.</TE>
<TE>   Today, L.A.'s alt-Latino bands come in many styles. They are
bilingual and monolingual, all-male and all-female, recent immigrants
and longtime residents, politically active and apathetic. Their art
can be as course as cursing or as refined as classic poetry. They
play everything from folk-rock-salsa fusions to raw punk, thrash
metal, rap, reggae and ska. Their names are as varied as their
sounds.</TE>
<TE>   There's a band called Calavera, which means "the skull," and
another called Skalavera, the skull that plays ska. The band Las 15
Letras is named after a bar where Pancho Villa killed a traitor.
Quinto Sol, a multicultural reggae group, takes its name from the
doomsday Aztec myth of the Fifth Sun. There's Horny Toad and Maria
Fatal. Los Abandoned and Los Villains (featuring Los Lobos'
offspring). Aztec Underground and Arkestra Clandestina. The Blues
Experiment and Burning Star.</TE>
<TE>   There's even diversity among the all-girl bands: Femi-Tabu are
stand-up rockers, while Cihuatl Tonalli (Circle of Women) play
indigenous instruments sitting down.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the bands admire Los Lobos, but few come close to that
level of composing and playing--not yet. The majority of local bands
lack experience and an original identity. Their sound can be raw,
their presentation unpolished. Their events can be a little flaky.
Sometimes the bands don't show. Sometimes, there are almost more
bands than fans.</TE>
<TE>   At the recent Aztlan Fest, an annual, daylong marathon of local
Latin rock held in the large parking lot of the Grand Olympic
Auditorium, just a few hundred die-hard fans came and went during the
day. Yet band after band played punk and thrash as if they were stars
of arena rock.</TE>
<TE>   A small group of young men dressed in gothic black started a mosh
pit at one point, but they were too few and too scattered to create
the critical mass required. They just marched around in a circle,
occasionally speeding up to push and shove one another, as if they
were driving bumper cars, without the cars. Nearby, only scattered
customers approached booths selling CDs and T-shirts with the
clashing images of Zapata and Iron Maiden.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody is innocent," shouted the lead singer of the Mexican metal
band Garrobos to close its set. "Todos somos criminals" (We are all
criminals).</TE>
<TE>   That pearl of subversive rock wisdom was delivered with such
conviction you could imagine the missing roar of the masses.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has always enjoyed the lively presence of some forms
of Latin music--from the Afro-Cuban dance bands of the mambo era to
the excellent mariachi ensembles of today. But this region has lagged
in the pop and rock arena. In fact, Los Lobos, which next year
celebrates 30 years as a group, is the only major band to emerge from
L.A.'s Latino community in the past two decades. Skeptics say that
predictions about the potential of L.A.'s alt-Latino scene are as old
as Los Lobos themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, during the '60s and '70s, there were so many local bands
in the barrios that they created their own style. The so-called East
L.A. sound was popularized by groups such as Cannibal and the
Headhunters, which opened for the Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl in
1964, and Tierra, which had a brief stint on the pop charts in the
early '70s.</TE>
<TE>   But it all went nowhere. In fact, the surge of the '70s was
followed by the empty '80s. In the '90s, ironically, L.A. became an
important consumer market for Latin alternative music from other
countries. And it is now home to two of the most important figures in
rock en espanol: famed Argentine-born producer Gustavo Santaolalla
and talent manager Tomas Cookman, who co-organizes the annual Latin
Alternative Music Conference in New York, where he was raised.</TE>
<TE>   Neither of these heavy hitters expresses much faith in L.A.'s
current crop of bands, struggling to compete with the big acts they
represent. Santaolalla, who has produced albums by Juanes and Cafe
Tacuba, says Latinos in L.A. simply don't suffer enough to create
truly great music like their counterparts south of the border, who
daily deal with poverty, political violence and corruption.</TE>
<TE>   "Alternative music nurtures itself with context," says
Santaolalla, who has his home and studio in Echo Park. "That's why we
have such exciting music coming out of Latin America, because the
reality there is so harsh. It's not the same thing to be a starving
musician in Los Angeles [as] to be a starving musician in
Montevideo."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Please don't preach to Giovanny Blanco about what it's like to be
a struggling musician in L.A. The singer-bandleader-VJ was 12 when he
first saw Los Lobos on a cable network in the Dominican Republic,
where he was born and raised. It was a revelatory moment for a kid
who idolized Queen's Freddie Mercury. Blanco was thrilled to see
"Latin dudes doing rock!"</TE>
<TE>   Back home, Blanco became part of a teeny-bop group named
Mermelada, which sold 50,000 albums, "and I didn't see a dime." After
a move to the East Coast, a car crash that left him in the hospital
for six months at 17, a breakup with his girlfriend and the breakup
of another band, Blanco headed to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, he became a founding member of Viva Malpache, a new band
influenced by Mexico's Maldita Vecindad and Argentina's Fabulosos
Cadillacs, which both represented the fusion of rock and native Latin
styles. It took a year to record their first self-financed album,
"Los Greatest Hits de Viva Malpache," using leftover studio time at 2
a.m. after paying bands went home for the night. "We were on a
mission to get recognized," says Blanco. "We wore black suits with
black ties and Mexican masks we bought in Tijuana."</TE>
<TE>   Blanco recalls one early show at a swap meet in West Covina,
attended by only 300 fans. Because of the competitive jostling for
position in the lineup, Viva Malpache kept getting bumped. They
finally went on at midnight, the last band of the evening.</TE>
<TE>   Then they were told to keep their set short. But when Blanco's
mike was cut off after just one song, the band furiously kept
playing. So the singer jumped into the crowd of some 50 stragglers,
who then stormed the stage and started overturning speakers.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going anywhere in this town," the angry soundman later
threatened.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't do anything, man, but what I came here to do," answered
Blanco.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, Viva Malpache opened for the legendary Maldita
Vecindad --and the same soundman remained silent.</TE>
<TE>   Blanco, 31, has struggled to keep the band together. He has
started a respected side project named Spigga, a "trippy jazz" duo
along with his friend Jaswho?,who's dabbled in house, funk and
reggae.</TE>
<TE>   Does Blanco think L.A. bands have potential?</TE>
<TE>   "Without a doubt," he says over a hobo omelet at a diner near his
cramped Echo Park apartment. "First, we need to get a little more
organized. And second, we need to get out of here. We've all hit the
ceiling locally, and what we need to do is prove that we can rock
crowds out of the country."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The members of Pastilla, another veteran L.A. band, were headed to
Mexico City last month. But first, they had to raise the funds for
the tour.</TE>
<TE>   Formed in the early '90s by two brothers and their high school
buddies from Pomona, Pastilla was once the sensation of the local
scene--the only home-grown, rock en espanol band to land a record
deal with a major label, BMG of Mexico. Everybody thought it was the
big breakthrough that would finally put L.A.'s Spanish rock scene on
the map. But after two albums, Pastilla's rock-star pretensions had
far outstripped its record sales.</TE>
<TE>   It's been four years since Pastilla's last record, "Vox Electra,"
which contained an unusual bilingual song that played in Spanish on
the left speaker and English on the right. (Listeners turned the
balance dial to avoid stereo babble.) Still with three of its
original members, the quartet headlined a show at the Westchester
Sports Grill on one recent Friday night. The funky, '50s-style bar,
located in a strip mall near the airport, has become a low-rent venue
for weekly rock en espanol shows.</TE>
<TE>   The place is far from glamorous, with its white rock walls on the
outside and fake wood paneling inside. A big eight ball adorns its
retro sign out front, dominating the coin laundry and tortilla
factory next door. The crowd is young, 16 to 25, tops. They're mostly
Latino, dressed as hip as their immigrant means allow.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a hungry crowd," says Juan "Da Bomb" Rodriguez, a key local
promoter of rock en espanol events. "These people who come out to the
shows are the ones who want something big in L.A."</TE>
<TE>   The kids are so well-behaved that Pastilla's singer at one point
berates them for acting as if they're at a wake. Smokers casually
linger outside within a roped-off area in the parking lot. Inside
near the bar, young men shoot pool, using cue sticks occasionally to
play air guitar.</TE>
<TE>   Near the stage, a table draped in a Mexican serape is set up to
take donations for the band's then-pending, two-week tour to Mexico
City. A small, resealable sandwich bag served as a kitty for the
collection. By midnight, it contained just a couple of dollars and
some coins.</TE>
<TE>   With no label support, touring becomes too expensive. So to help
send Pastilla to Mexico, the three other bands on the bill--Fanatic,
Uztar and Curanderos--have agreed to play for free. The take from the
$10 cover charge all goes to the cause.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope you guys do good, because we're coming right after you,"
shouted the singer for Curanderos, which will need its own
fund-raiser to help pay for its upcoming Mexican tour.</TE>
<TE>   The concept of creating a circuit between L.A. and Mexico is being
backed by Spanishrockla.com, Juan Da Bomb's Web site, and Al Borde, a
weekly newspaper that promotes the local scene. Recently, the
newspaper also sponsored a series of workshops at two coffeehouses
that also feature local acts, Cafe Bolivar in Santa Monica and
Angeles Bohemios on Sunset Boulevard. The topics included how to
produce your own record and how to copyright your work, a protection
local musicians virtually ignore, though songwriting is often their
greatest strength. (Pastilla has 45 new songs in the can for its next
album.)</TE>
<TE>   So much work, so little payoff. Don't these people get
disillusioned?</TE>
<TE>   "No, I'm excited about being in L.A., because there's a whole
scene here and people come out to support the bands," says Grant
Goad, Pastilla's manager, as the band starts grinding through its
midnight set on the club's crackling sound system. "Our goal is to
get a new album out and go on the road, and if the major labels don't
want to help, then we'll just do it ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In L.A., the promotion of local Spanish rock has always been a
grass-roots effort. One of the original marketing plans was
unwittingly started by two close friends, with only a stack of index
cards and a lonely passion for the music.</TE>
<TE>   Yvonne Gomez and Flora Tapia founded the Club Rock en Espanol in
October 1989 at their homes in Monterey Park and Southgate. They were
on "an eternal search for cool Latin rock music," says Yvonne, who
now is manager for Santaolalla's Surco label.</TE>
<TE>   Recordings were almost impossible to find in those days. They
figured there must be other fans like them in Southern California.
But there was no way to connect. Until one day, a story about the
girls appeared in a local magazine, along with their home phone as a
club contact.</TE>
<TE>   They were flooded with calls. They soon had 3,000 names and
addresses of fans on those index cards, and the major labels latched
onto them as the only marketing tool in town for alternative music,
Gomez recalls.</TE>
<TE>   They soon became known as Las Chicas del CREE, the club's acronym,
which is Spanish for "believe." Eventually, they started promoting
local shows and managing the emerging bands.</TE>
<TE>   Across town at UCLA, student and alt-Latino fan Mariluz Gonzalez
began booking acts on campus. Hard-core devotees also braved muggings
and police raids to attend underground shows at an empty warehouse in
South-Central, a place fans nicknamed La Bodega.</TE>
<TE>   But by far the hottest spot for the nascent scene was Hong Kong
Low, a now-closed restaurant on Broadway in Chinatown that once
featured punk bands. That place was "lo maximo" (the best), recalled
Gonzalez, who recently borrowed $4,000 from her credit union to start
a new indie label, SourPOP Records.</TE>
<TE>   Every Friday night, the Chinatown shows became like a family
gathering of musicians and their fans.</TE>
<TE>   "They were all L.A. bands," Gomez said. "They were our bands, and
they were our friends. It was like we were all joined together by
this music, and it didn't really matter where we were from or what
language we spoke. We were all just roqueros."</TE>
<TE>   At around the time Las Chicas del CREE were getting organized,
Tony Estrada started his band, Voz de Mano. He was 20 at the time,
still single. Now 32, he's married and has two daughters, one born
just last month.</TE>
<TE>   Estrada, a guitarist and songwriter, still has the band, which has
released three independent albums, attracting critical praise but few
sales. In the early days, he thought for sure they'd be big stars by
now. Estrada, who works for the Pasadena Water &amp; Power department,
says he still loves what he does and has no intention of giving it
up. Music is "kind of like therapy for me," says the native of the
Mexican coastal state of Nayarit, who moved here at age 4, with his
parents and siblings all cramming into a single hotel room.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, says the soft-spoken musician, he'll hear a melody in
his head while he's at work or running errands. So he calls home and
hums the melody into his message machine.</TE>
<TE>   "What is that thing you left on the voice mail?" his wife asked
one time.</TE>
<TE>   "That's my next song," answered Estrada. "Don't erase it."</TE>

<LD>La Banda Elastica, the magazine of Latin alternative music, presents
the second annual Battle of the Bands in Los Angeles, with the first
round of competition taking place next Thursday. From hundreds of

<LD>* The 26-year-old forward has played with the Lakers for two
championship seasons.</LD>
<LD>   Team Dinners: One thing that was really cool that Rick Fox did was
he planned a team dinner at the beginning of every single round of
the playoffs. One of the first was at a place called Asia de Cuba up
in West Hollywood, which was really good. And then we also went to a
place called the Palm in West Hollywood. During the playoffs, we all
spent time together at those dinners and were able to unwind, relax
and share stories from the last series of the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Shopping With Shaq: I go to Rochester Big &amp; Tall on Wilshire in
Beverly Hills almost exclusively. The thing I like about it most is
just that it has big sizes. That's the thing. I went to the Men's
Wearhouse last year, and I guess one of my suits didn't quite fit me
right, because all the guys on the team said that I needed a looser
fit. At Rochester Big &amp; Tall, they have a lot of loose-fitting things
and the people there are really nice. A couple of years ago, Shaq
took me there to help me pick out a few things.</LD>
<TE>   Mormon Singles: For the last few years, every Sunday, I've gone to
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is located
right behind the big temple on Santa Monica Boulevard. The services
are three hours long. It's actually a young, single, adult
congregation, so I've made some good friends. You're going for the
worship service, but it's specifically for singles, and a few of my
friends have met their boyfriend or girlfriend there and gotten
married. I was recently asked to be a Sunday school teacher in the
congregation, so I teach twice a month and I spend some time during
the week preparing the lesson. I try to go to church when the team is
in other cities too. It doesn't always work out in every city, but
that's something that I really enjoy.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "A World I Never Made," presented by the Occasional Theatre at
Third Stage, playwright Bryan Williams is trying so hard to be Eugene
O'Neill, it hurts. Although self-consciously Irish in tone, Williams'
misbegotten story is set in America from 1979 to 1988.</LD>
<LD>   The narrator, who steps out of the action to tip the audience off
about what it has just seen and what it can expect to see, is Nell
(Barbara Keegan), a lovelorn Irish-born widow who runs an inner-city
tavern catering to cops.</LD>
<LD>   Nell has nursed an unrequited love for her brother-in-law Evan
(Jim Krestalude) since their school days.</LD>
<TE>   One very moody guy, Evan is so inflexible that he has seriously
estranged his wife and teenage daughter. As his personal life erupts
in tragedy, Evan focuses his obsessive anger on the unfortunate Dete
(Greg Vojtanek), a small-time drug dealer who once sold pot to Evan's
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' primary theme, emphasized at frequent and didactic
intervals, is that all actions have reactions, and that people are
responsible for their behavior. Evan's inflexibility, Nell's
resulting deception and Dete's moral failings all have tragic
consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Those consequences are unforeseen by the characters. The audience,
however, spots them coming a mile away. Instead of mitigating
Williams' blatant sentimentality, director Michael Lilly, justly
lauded for such previous efforts as "Elephant Sighs" and "Additional
Particulars," both by playwright Ed Simpson, buys right into it.
Characters croon Irish ballads at the drop of a shillelagh, and
belabored metaphoric yarns are delivered to the sting of sappy music.</TE>
<TE>   Lines like "The links of the fence are clattering like banshees"
don't help, nor does Krestalude's weirdly stiff performance.</TE>
<TE>   As for Lilly, he puts his actors in awkward situations and lets
them flounder, gasping fish out of place in a mulligan stew.</TE>
<TE>   "A World I Never Made," Third Stage, 2811 W. Magnolia Blvd.,
Burbank. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends Aug. 17. $15. (818)
842-4755. Running time: 2 hours, 25 minutes.</TE>

<HD>Pharoah Sanders Quartet, With a Nod to John Coltrane</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saxophonist Pharoah Sanders was an important participant in the
heady, envelope-stretching jazz of the '60s. Closely associated with
John Coltrane's ensembles for the last few years of the legendary
figure's life, he interacted synergistically, influenced by
Coltrane's style while simultaneously contributing his own robust
musical passions to the music's turbulent currents.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday night at Catalina's Bar &amp; Grill, Sanders opened his set
with vivid recollections of those connections--first via an
incantatory rendering of "Welcome," followed by an up-tempo romp
through "Giant Steps." Although these particular works were first
heard before Sanders' arrival in the Coltrane circle, his capacity to
grasp their fullest creative implications was profound.</LD>
<LD>   "Welcome" was the perfect introduction to the evening, a work
whose soaring melody took flight via Sanders' upper-register lines
over a murmuring, shimmering swirl of sound and rhythm from pianist
William Henderson, bassist Jeff Littleton and drummer Ralph Penland.</LD>
<TE>   When vocalist Dwight Tribble entered, initially with sweet,
suspended tones, eventually arriving at a warmly spiritual musical
greeting, the performance reached an extraordinary level of
collective communication.</TE>
<TE>   "Giant Steps" shot headfirst into the upper stratosphere of
extended harmonic improvising. The tune's chordal scheme--a
stunningly demanding sequence in which key changes arrive every few
bars with frightening regularity--posed no hazards for Sanders.
Launching quickly, he delivered a stunningly facile improvisation,
playing at great length, maintaining his inventive edge from
beginning to end.</TE>
<TE>   The balance of the set shifted away from Coltrane and into a
multilayered version of "Body and Soul," with particularly
imaginative contributions from the gifted Tribble. (At a time when
male jazz singers are in such short supply, it's astonishing that
talents in- ferior to his are receiving so much more attention.) A
hand-clapping blues--displaying Sanders' considerable
versatility--wound matters up.</TE>
<TE>   It would be easy to criticize Sanders--as some have done--for his
allegiance to the Coltrane musical canon. But this music--like that
of Ellington, Monk, Parker et al--is part of the essential jazz
repertoire.</TE>
<TE>   Although most of it was not conceived in the same fashion as
European concert music, it similarly merits continuing interpretation
and reinterpretation. And Sanders deserves credit for doing just
that--for insisting that Coltrane, like Bach, should be heard in
every possible creative manifestation.</TE>

<HD>International Pop Overthrow: 180 Acts, 17 Days, 10 Venues</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Bronson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As he convenes the fifth edition of International Pop Overthrow,
festival founder David Bash acknowledges a comic frailty.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't say no," the 43-year-old promoter says, shaking his head
giddily at a 180-act lineup that includes 23 shows over 17 days at 10
venues. "There are so many bands that want to play."</LD>
<LD>   The festival, a celebration of hook- and harmony-laden music
tracing its roots to such forebears as the Beatles, Raspberries,
Cheap Trick and the Beach Boys, features seven or eight bands per
show, each playing sets of about half an hour.</LD>
<TE>   Almost half the groups hail from outside Southern California,
including 18 from outside the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   That so many performers again agreed to play Bash's
showcase--free--fuels the momentum he gained in the last eight months
by staging festivals for the first time in New York and Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "People had been suggesting I take IPO on the road, and last
summer Michael Mazzarella of the Rooks told me, 'You could take this
thing to New York,' " Bash says.</TE>
<TE>   The native New Yorker said yes, and the resulting IPONY in
December attracted 90 bands to small clubs around a city wounded by
the events of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not the New York I remembered," says Bash. "I got the
sense that the people had a renewed sense of life in general."</TE>
<TE>   It followed, then, that Bash would take IPO to Chicago, a
power-pop mecca and home of the band whose first album gave the
festival its name, Material Issue. "It was a perfect fit," he says of
the 150-band event in April.</TE>
<TE>   Bash's wave of inclusion even carried over to this year's IPO
album (free to attendees at any show). "International Pop Overthrow
Vol. 5" is a three-disc, 68-song collection featuring an unreleased
Jellyfish number and tracks by such artists as the Lackloves, Helium
Angel, Copperpot, AM Radio, Starbelly and Kevin Tihista.</TE>

<LD>   Johnny on the Spot--The opening image of "Johnny on the Spot" at
the Matrix is a glowing joint, followed by the toker's
radio-announcer intonations. Thus the title character of Neil
Landau's new play about a Peter Pan-syndrome poster boy's journey to
maturity is introduced. Johnny (Jason Brooks) fears conformity, but
the box is closing in. Neither his long-suffering pregnant girlfriend
(Helen Cates) nor his pill-packing mother (Miriam Flynn) thinks
Johnny is ready for fatherhood. Having just lost his insurance job,
he quite agrees. Director Jules Aaron stages this post-Durang parable
with sleek expertise. Brooks, balancing priceless stoner moments with
inner anguish, is marvelously attuned to the affecting Cates. Flynn's
locomotive delivery hijacks the house. Landau's quirky, assured
script carries post-larval incongruities, the ghosts erratically
integrated and Johnny's narration evaporating midstream. But merely
the emotional tug of the inspired denouement disarms criticism, as
does the immensely satisfying trip it concludes.</LD>

<HD>ABC Keeps It in the Family</HD>
<DH>Executives hope to turn the network's fortunes with nightly
'happy hour'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Still reeling from a dismal season in which prime-time ratings fell
more than 20%, ABC officials told reporters Wednesday that they hope
the network has touched bottom and can begin to see "tangible signs
of a turnaround" during the coming television season.</LD>
<LD>   Meeting the press as part of the twice annual TV Critics Assn.
tour in Pasadena, network officials also acknowledged that most of
the new programs on its fall lineup won't offer much appeal to
critics, who tend to be drawn to more challenging and offbeat fare.
ABC Entertainment President Susan Lyne said the schedule is, rather,
tailored to "what a network audience is looking for when they come
home after a long day."</LD>
<LD>   "We'll leave groundbreaking to someone else," said Lyne, who
assumed her post in January after her predecessor, Stu Bloomberg, was
let go.</LD>
<TE>   ABC is seeking to improve its fortunes in part by establishing
programs with broad family appeal nightly during the first hour of
prime time--billing it as the ABC "happy hour"--in an effort to bring
cohesion to a schedule that has undergone sweeping changes. Lyne
flagged one of the new night-opening shows, the sitcom "8 Simple
Rules ... ," starring John Ritter, as having "the cleanest shot" at
becoming a hit.</TE>
<TE>   Although the strategy represents a kind of return to the network's
roots, many TV industry executives are second-guessing its chances of
succeeding, saying it harks back to an era that no longer exists,
given the explosion of new channels and competition that the major
networks face.</TE>
<TE>   Lyne's boss, ABC Entertainment Television Group Chairman Lloyd
Braun, said that despite the disappointments endured of late, the
network has seen some "encouraging" signs, among them the fact that
ABC sold roughly as much advance prime-time advertising for the
2002-2003 season--around $1.5 billion--as it did last year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, that reflects a decline of more than $700 million from two
seasons ago, when the network occupied first place thanks to the
since-faded "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." In addition, the network
ad market rebounded somewhat this year, making ABC's competitive
standing much worse, with the network's sales lag by more than $1
billion behind prime-time leader NBC.</TE>
<TE>   Braun also caused critics to wince a bit by suggesting that ABC
would be working to "squeeze every last ounce of appeal out of every
show." He subsequently stressed that the network would collaborate
with producers and not dictate changes designed to make their
programs more commercially viable.</TE>
<TE>   ABC will have a few advantages during the coming season that it
didn't possess this year. The network has acquired rights to NBA
basketball games previously shown on NBC and will broadcast the Super
Bowl in January, which will be used as a launching pad to introduce a
new late-night comedy series with Jimmy Kimmel as host.</TE>
<TE>   The network also brings back "The Bachelor," the dating show that
delivered strong ratings last season. ABC announced Wednesday that in
addition to a version that mirrors the original--in which one man
chooses a potential mate from among 25 women--the network will turn
the tables with "The Bachelorette," featuring Trista Rehn, the
runner-up from the first edition, picking one of 25 men. The former
will premiere in the fall, while the latter incarnation with Rehn is
tentatively set for January.</TE>
<TE>   After canceling some series with borderline ratings--including the
first-year drama "Philly" and "Once and Again," which had a smaller
but fiercely loyal following--Braun said the network will "need to
err on the side of patience" in deciding whether to stick with its
new shows.</TE>
<TE>   One problem ABC faces is that its ratings have fallen so far, its
on-air advertising--a key source of promotion--is reaching fewer
people. As a result, the network will take advantage of the far-flung
marketing resources of its corporate parent, the Walt Disney Co.</TE>
<TE>   Questions also linger about Disney officials' level of influence
in ABC's programming decisions, and Disney President Robert Iger was
in attendance Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   For her part, Lyne said the new job is "more fun than anything I
have done in my life."</TE>
<TE>   ABC is also amending the much-lampooned yellow color scheme
introduced a few years ago, with a new network logo and graphics for
fall that the network describes as being "an upbeat color spectrum
full of life and energy."</TE>

<LD>   Alcohol, Cocaine Found in Aaliyah Pilot's System</LD>
<TE>   The Bahamas Department of Civil Aviation announced Tuesday that
Luis Antonio Morales, pilot of the doomed flight that killed
singer-actress Aaliyah last summer, had cocaine and alcohol in his
system at the time the plane went down.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are still trying to determine the extent to which
those substances--revealed in an autopsy and subsequent toxicology
tests--influenced his flight skills.</TE>
<TE>   The statement also indicated that the Cessna 402B, which was
flying 700 pounds overweight, may not have had the requisite
maintenance, specifically fuel-pump wiring modifications. But an
examination of the plane showed no cause for malfunction.</TE>
<TE>   It has already been established that the pilot was not authorized
to fly the Cessna and that, 12 days before the crash, he'd been in a
Florida courtroom pleading no contest to cocaine possession,
trafficking in stolen airplane parts, theft and driving with a
suspended license. He was sentenced to three years' probation.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities have launched a criminal probe into the owner
of the plane--Florida-based Chacon's Blackhawk International Airways,
which wasn't licensed to fly charter planes in the Bahamas. A civil
lawsuit has been filed by the families of Aaliyah and other victims,
charging Virgin Records, several video production companies and
Blackhawk with negligence and recklessness.</TE>
<TE>   The singer was in the Bahamas shooting a video for "Rock the
Boat," an album released posthumously.</TE>

<TE>   New 'Ren &amp; Stimpy' Episodes on the Way</TE>
<TE>   John Kricfalusi, the man who created the Nickelodeon hit "The Ren
&amp; Stimpy Show," is coming back--creating six new original episodes of
the series for TNN.</TE>
<TE>   The network will also air the 52 original shows as part of its
adult animation block set to launch in the spring. The tale of an
ornery asthmatic Chihuahua and his trusting feline sidekick, the show
was a catalyst for the animation renaissance of the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   It's a victory, of sorts, for Kricfalusi, who left the series
during its second season in 1992 in an acrimonious parting with
Nickelodeon, which continued to produce the program. A resulting
lawsuit was settled out of court and Viacom now owns the property.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole gang is back. It's just like the old days--only ruder,"
said Kricfalusi, who will reprise the voice of Ren.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angelina Jolie and her husband, Billy Bob Thornton, have been
living apart for four months and haven't seen each other since June
3, the Oscar-winning actress told Us Weekly. Thornton's spokesman
told the magazine they remain "very married." ... Paul McCartney will
kick off his "Back to the U.S." tour this fall--a few months after
completing his first swing through the nation. Local dates: the
Arrowhead Pond on Oct. 25 and Staples Center three days
later....David Chase, the creator of "The Sopranos," revealed this
week that he and the show's producers are discussing the possibility
of a big-screen version after the HBO series ends....'N Sync's Lance
Bass has been selected by the Russian Aviation and Space Agency to
fill the third seat of the fall space mission, though he still has
several steps to complete and no contract has been signed.... "The
Price Is Right" host Bob Barker returned to his L.A. home Tuesday
after undergoing prostate surgery. He expects to return to work Aug.

<HD>Wuhrer Has Dreams--But No Illusions</HD>
<DH>The B-movie veteran is happy, sort of, to continue to
appear in films such as the new horror-comedy 'Eight Legged Freaks'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK OLSEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The stars are the spiders, really. The rest of us take a back seat
to the giant spiders."</LD>
<LD>   It's hard to imagine many actresses approaching a certain age
talking with such seemingly genuine enthusiasm about starring
opposite David Arquette and a gaggle of computer-generated spiders,
even harder to conceive such a role underscoring a career
renaissance.</LD>
<LD>   Kari Wuhrer is definitely not most actresses.</LD>
<TE>   Her role as a small-town sheriff and single mother in "Eight
Legged Freaks," which opened Wednesday, marks something of a turning
point. Directed by Ellory Elkayem, and produced by Dean Devlin and
Roland Emmerich, the studio-financed "Freaks" is a far cry from the
independent, late-night cable fare that makes up the majority of her
surprisingly large resume.</TE>
<TE>   Vivacious and candid, with the air of a knowledgeable yet unjaded
veteran, Wuhrer seems all too aware of her position in the Hollywood
food chain.</TE>
<TE>   Since her emergence on the late '80s MTV game show "Remote
Control" (which also introduced to the world Colin Quinn and Adam
Sandler), she has picked up a sizable fan base among the ranks of
sci-fi/fantasy junkies, Internet shut-ins and B-movie trash
aficionados. Over the years, she's done an infomercial, appeared in a
video game and been to the brink of a broader, more mainstream
stardom numerous times--be it for her work as Jack Nicholson's
stripper girlfriend in "The Crossing Guard" or her role on the cult
TV show "Sliders"--but Wuhrer exudes a definite sense that her time
is now.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a woman in her early 30s," information the 35-year-old
delivers with a playful, knowing wink, "it's hard to say how many
more chances I'll get.</TE>
<TE>   "I've done 50 movies--most of them not good--but nothing's ever
really put me over. But within taking these parts and doing those
films, I can never say I didn't get something out of every piece of
[junk] I've ever done.</TE>
<TE>   "Because I have. Even if it was just the chance to travel the
world. So what if the sets are cardboard and shake when you close a
door--I got paid to see Prague. What's wrong with that?"</TE>
<TE>   Long a staple of the Maxim/FHM men's magazine circuit, Wuhrer's
freewheeling, top-down, up-for-anything persona in many ways
predicated the guy's-girl phenomenon of Cameron Diaz rump-shaking and
naughty-not-dirty lasciviousness. That same exuberant "life force,"
as she calls it, has also at times gotten in the way of growth both
personal and professional, and Wuhrer is now determined to change
some minds.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people have a hard time defining me because I've a hard
time defining me," she explains. "So I've fallen into that B-class
category of 'chick with fake boobs who sort of can act.' Which is
great for B-movies, but it became too easy, and I stayed there
because it was safe.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been given great opportunities--I work steadily, I have a
house and a good life because of it--but I've sold myself short, so
other people have too. It's not an insult to be thought of as a
B-actress, but I'm tired of that now, I'm bored with it. It doesn't
feel like who I really am. So I got rid of the boobs and I'm getting
myself together to annihilate the image I've created through fear. I
just want the stakes to be higher. I'm ready for that."</TE>
<TE>   With a handful of independent roles still awaiting release, after
"Eight Legged Freaks" Wuhrer is looking for material to produce
herself, hoping to more closely shape and control the image she
conveys through her work.</TE>
<TE>   Despite her years of struggle, Wuhrer hasn't lost sight of what
brought her to this "kaleidoscope fantasy land" in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the movie game," she gushes. "I just love it. I've made a
million movies, but it's still so much fun to me. It's everything
I've ever dreamed of. It's exciting to be on a billboard on Sunset
Boulevard, and I'm not beyond enjoying it.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in this business for 18, 19 years, and the little
things still make me giddy. Like when they mentioned my birthday on
'Entertainment Tonight'!"</TE>

<LD>Suede and Comfort Food: Designer Dodd Mitchell, who's responsible for
the look of Sushi Roku, Katana and Linq, is in the midst of creating
a new place called Avenue, which is aiming to open in Beverly Hills
in September. "It will be really sexy, with lots of grays and
browns," he says; "lots of suede and some fake fur." He plans to
place 2-foot square silicone pillows in silly, unexpected places.
(Yes, that's silicone, as in silicone implant.)</LD>
<LD>   The restaurant-lounge will feature a suspended bar, a lot of
African ebony, glossy teak floors and custom kitchen equipment in
red-toned stainless steel. "You'll be able to see the Sub-Zero
[refrigerator] like you're in someone's home," he says. It also will
have a large, circular patio with a fireplace and fountains,
waterfalls and the like. The food will be simpler. Executive chef
Andrew DeGroot (former executive chef at Casa del Mar and Pastis)
describes it as upscale American comfort foods with a few exotic
dishes thrown in.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The sixth annual Latino International Film Festival runs Friday
through July 28 at the Egyptian and several other nearby venues. It
offers a wide range of films, videos and special programs.</LD>
<LD>   Betty Kaplan's "Almost a Woman" (L.A. Film School, 6363 Sunset
Blvd., Hollywood, Saturday at 5 p.m.), adapted by Esmeralda Santiago
from her memoir, lacks style and pace, but is a warm, well-acted and
poignant account of a gifted young Puerto Rican, Negi (Ana Maria
Lagasca), who arrives in Manhattan in 1961 when her mother (Wanda De
Jesus) leaves her philandering father, taking with her three of her
seven children, to begin a new life. It is a classic immigrant saga
focusing on Negi's growing need to forge an identity that
incorporates both American and Puerto Rican culture. De Jesus is a
strong and stunning presence.</LD>
<LD>   Jesse Lerner's "The American Egypt" (Egyptian's Spielberg Theater,
6712 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, Monday at 7:30 p.m.) is a boldly
experimental documentary that connects the evolution of the silent
cinema with the emergence of the Americas' first socialist
government--on the Yucatan peninsula between 1915 and 1924 as part of
the Mexican Revolution. Mexico's first feminist congress was held
there in 1916, but the progressive rule of Gov. Salvador Alvarado
ended with his assassination in 1924.</LD>
<TE>   Drawing from a treasure trove of largely unfamiliar archival
footage and period texts, Lerner links U.S. economic exploitation--in
this instance, the growing of sisal hemp, the source of twine--with
that in other Latin American countries, and compares oppression of
laborers with that of slaves in the pre-Civil War South. Lerner even
reconstructs scenes from Mexico's first feature film, a no longer
extant work shot in Yucatan. "The American Egypt's" wealth of images
and information, assembled in a complex, intricate structure,
presents a challenge to the viewer, but it's one well worth
accepting, even if it is not possible to comprehend everything in one
viewing.</TE>
<TE>   Three other splendid documentaries also screen: "Yank Tanks,"
about the mechanics who keep Cuba's 1940s-era American cars running
(Egyptian, Sunday at 8:50 p.m. and Wednesday at 3:20 p.m.); "Nosotros
La Musica" (Egyptian, Wednesday at 7 p.m.), a 1965 survey of popular
music and its stars; and "La Tropical" (Egyptian, Sunday at 11 a.m.),
about a legendary open-air ballroom and revue theater that is the
cradle of Afro-Cuban music; it first screened in the recent Los
Angeles Film Festival. (323) 469-9066.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the New York Independent Film and Video Festival
continues at the Fairfax Cinemas and Raleigh Studios. David
Warfield's "Ocean Park" (tonight at 6 at Raleigh, 5300 Melrose Ave.,
Hollywood) marks a feature debut of painstaking craftsmanship and
sophisticated style. It is a morality tale of the eternal power of
Hollywood to corrupt, and takes the form of a murder mystery. It
involves two young actor friends, Wilson (Kenneth Hughes) and Rick
(Jonathan Aube). Rick makes it big quickly while Wilson, probably the
more talented, doesn't. Alexandra Wilson is Jolette, an unstable
aspiring actress, who becomes entangled with both men. The cast is
solid, with Aube a standout, and technical credits are impressive.</TE>
<TE>   Screening tonight at 6 at the Fairfax (7907 Beverly Blvd., L.A.)
is Joffre McClung's "Best Wishes," a sort of upbeat reworking of
"Imitation of Life," in that a white woman and a black woman form a
friendship and then a successful business partnership. McClung
probably took on too much by starring as well as writing and
directing, for the film lacks pace and is overly talky. She is a
capable actress and her co-star, Danielle Rickman, is more than that.</TE>
<TE>   McClung plays Peggy, a pretty, dutiful and woefully neglected and
unappreciated housewife of a successful, hard-driving, belittling and
often absent husband in Fort Worth in the 1950s. When Rickman's
recently widowed Lucille comes to work as Peggy's housekeeper, the
two women forge a friendship that is put to an unexpected test when
Lucille discovers that Peggy has an amazing way with desserts and
sweets. (323) 363-5096.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The American Cinematheque's Alternative Screen series offers
tonight (the Egyptian, 7:30) an accomplished example of independent
regional filmmaking. Richard Bean's "Tattoo: A Love Story" is a
slight but sweet romantic comedy in which an ultra-controlling,
conservative and exceedingly dedicated Boise, Idaho, third-grade
teacher finds herself astonished to discover her attraction toward a
laid-back, handsome but very hefty tattoo parlor owner and biker, who
is his own best advertisement. Virgil (Virgil Mignanelli) represents
all that Megan Edwards' uptight Sara ostensibly deplores, only to
have her view of him shift when her live-in fiance (Stephen F.
Davies), a local physician, decides he needs a vacation from her
bossiness. Sara and Virgil have a transforming effect on each other,
and are very well-played by Edwards and Mignanelli, with the film
ending on just the right note.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfest 2002 winds up Monday with the 8 p.m. screening at the
Regent Showcase (614 N. La Brea Ave., L.A.) of Stanley Kwan's
beautifully told love story "Lan Yu." Liu Ye has the title role as an
impoverished student from the countryside who falls in love with Chen
Handong (Hu Jun, the park policeman in "East Palace, West Palace"), a
hard-driving head of a shady Beijing securities company.</TE>
<TE>   To Handong, the slim Yu is merely a hustler, a convenience while
he presents to the world a macho facade, even marrying for the sake
of preserving a heterosexual image. As the men's tempestuous
relationship seesaws, the corruption of contemporary China and the
continuing oppression of gays surface in a subtle manner. A stalwart
of the Hong Kong cinema, Kwan remains a consummate, evocative
storyteller.</TE>
<TE>   One of the festival's many notable documentaries, JJ Martin's "The
Self-Destruction of Gia" (Directors Guild, 7920 Sunset Blvd., L.A.,
Saturday at 9:45 p.m.) is especially compelling. Fashion model Gia
Carangi (1960-1986), whose story was also dramatized on HBO, was
breathtakingly beautiful, a member of the first generation of
supermodels. She was a lesbian, and her occasional use of heroin
became an epic-scale addiction. Splendid archival footage attests to
her awesome beauty, intelligence and recklessness; friends,
colleagues, her therapist, a lover and her mother speak of her
charisma and of the horrors she endured in her addiction and
excruciating death from AIDS. (323) 480-7065.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Nude Restaurant" (1968), which screens at the Pacific Design
Center in West Hollywood on Friday at 7 p.m. as part of the Museum of
Contemporary Art's Warhol on Screen series is all fantasy except for
a prologue in which Warhol superstar Viva talks a blue streak. We
then move to a restaurant in which Viva, playing a waitress, and her
customers wear nothing but G-strings.</TE>
<TE>   Viva, who could look alternately bizarre and exhibit a Garbo-like
beauty, has a wit and intellect that cuts through her dazed demeanor
and earns her considerable compassion. On the other hand, that same
intelligence helps make this nonstop talker appear tarantula-like
alongside the passive Warhol males--especially when she's perversely
paired with the marvelously woebegone and quite stoned Taylor Mead.

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At first glance, you might mistake Gary Lee Boas' Brownie camera
photographs for a vast collection of blurred and faded family
memories. There is something remarkably familiar in the towering
beehives, the tiny mini-dresses, the endless corduroy, all color bled
to a strangely nostalgic pale. The images look as if they could have
been pulled from the dust-covered albums that sit in bottom drawers,
or in attic boxes, of just about anyone.</LD>
<LD>   But a closer look reveals the subjects of Boas' prints to be not
Uncle Joe or Junior at the Little League championships, but a slew of
Hollywood icons: Charles Bronson standing on the side of a city
street, Jack Nicholson walking down a crowded hallway, Mick Jagger
slouched in the back seat of a car.</LD>
<LD>   What began nearly 36 years ago as an impulse grew into a hobby,
then full-blown obsession. Boas' immense body of work was finally
compiled in 1999 (by local publishers Dilettante Press) into the book
"Starstruck: Photographs From a Fan." The pictures themselves have
traveled to galleries all over the world, finally arriving, last
week, in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Boas began taking impromptu photographs of celebrities after
unexpectedly spotting singer Robert Goulet in his hometown of
Lancaster, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   "He was coming out of the doors of the hospital, and there were
all these people around him, a crowd of people smiling and laughing,
and there was something about that that excited me," remembers Boas,
"the excitement of being a fan. People were delirious. So I ran home
and grabbed my camera."</TE>
<TE>   Soon Boas began traveling to Philadelphia and New York for
theatrical openings and tapings of talk shows, waiting patiently at
back doors for a celebrity (any celebrity; Boas wasn't picky) to
emerge. The result of his persistence is literally thousands of
snapshots of everyone from Lucille Ball to Richard Nixon, each
captured for the camera in a way that is eerily revealing. Without an
army of stylists and makeup artists to provide an aesthetic armor,
these icons are shown in all their imperfection--as flawed, as
vulnerable and as real as any Aunt Bertha or Uncle Joe.</TE>
<TE>   Writing for Artforum a couple of years ago about Boas' work, Bruce
Hainley noted: "Boas is what Andy Warhol might have been if, instead
of aiming for that job in New York, he had stayed put in Pittsburgh
with his mother, Julia."</TE>
<TE>   As Boas describes his style, "There's an impulsiveness and
innocence I have when I shoot as a fan. As a professional, you don't
get the same results; you don't get the woman in the background with
the cat's-eye glasses or the '57 Chevy. There's an element to them
that makes them seem more real because you don't have that editing."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Boas himself has become a kind of celebrity, signing
autographs, doing interviews and, in a beautiful play of irony,
posing for photographs. But after a lifetime of celebrity worship,
his fanaticism seems to have finally begun to fade. Although he still
takes photos, he seems less than dazzled by the allure of today's
stars.</TE>
<TE>   "Stars were more accessible then. They were out in the real
world," Boas says rather wistfully. "I met Bette Davis in a back
alley in Philadelphia, and you're not going to meet Julia Roberts in
a back alley in Philadelphia. It's different today because it's not
so much about talent as about what they're wearing or who they're
shacking up with or if they had breast implants or not. Then, talent
was what mattered most, and that's what really made me want to take
their pictures, to capture that talent and that charisma. That was
the real seduction."</TE>

<LD>Yeah, baby, yeah.</LD>
<LD>   With the much-hyped "Austin Powers in Goldmember," starring Mike
Myers as the dentally challenged secret agent, due in theaters July
26, Fox Home Entertainment has released four groovy DVDs of popular
espionage thrillers from the 1960s ($15 each): "Our Man Flint," "In
Like Flint," "Fathom" and "Modesty Blaise."</LD>
<LD>   The best of the lot are the two "Flint" comedies. "Our Man Flint,"
from 1965, was Hollywood's answer to Ian Fleming's James Bond. In his
first starring role, James Coburn is Derek Flint, a U.S. secret agent
who must battle a unique deadly weapon: the weather. Lee J. Cobb, in
a rare comedic role, plays the president's rather overtaxed
right-hand man.</LD>
<TE>   In 1967's "In Like Flint," the secret agent is pitted against a
group of wealthy female tycoons who brainwash women through hair
dryers.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a lot of fun," recalled Coburn, 74. "Flint was a lot of
things I wanted to be."</TE>
<TE>   Coburn, who won a best supporting actor Oscar three years ago for
"Affliction," was a friend of the film's producer, Saul David.</TE>
<TE>   Raquel Welch stars in the silly but genial 1967 spoof "Fathom" as
the curvy Fathom Harvill, a champion U.S. skydiver competing in
Europe who is asked by a Scottish colonel working for a top-secret
organization to find an important atomic device that is missing.Try
to avoid at all costs "Modesty Blaise," a dreadful 1966 spoof that is
all style and no substance. Directed by the usually reliable Joseph
Losey, the film stars Italian actress Monica Vitti, struggling with
her English, as a sexy secret agent who is hired by the British as a
decoy in an elaborate diamond heist. Terence Stamp and Dirk Bogarde
are wasted in support.</TE>
<TE>   All four DVDs feature wide-screen editions of the films and the
original trailers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest foreign film hits in recent years is "Amelie,"
Jean-Pierre Jeunet's sweet, clever romantic fable. Pixyish French
actress Audrey Tautou shines as a shy young Parisian waitress who
discovers immense happiness when she performs random acts of
kindness. Nominated for five Academy Awards, including best
foreign-language film and original screenplay, "Amelie" also stars
Mathieu Kassovitz and Rufus.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax's lovely two-disc DVD ($30) of the French comedy includes
amusing commentary with director Jeunet available in French and
English. Though the director keeps saying he doesn't speak English
very well, he's quite understandable and has a wry and charming sense
of humor.</TE>
<TE>   There is also storyboard-to-film comparison, an "intimate chat"
with Jeunet in French with English subtitles, a terrific look at the
making of the film that is produced in the style of a home movie.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New from Criterion is the two-disc DVD of Wes Anderson's quirky,
whimsical comedy "The Royal Tenenbaums" ($30). Gene Hackman stars as
the eccentric patriarch of a dysfunctional family, along with
Anjelica Huston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, Bill
Murray, Danny Glover and Owen Wilson (who also co-wrote the film with
Anderson).</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's brother, Eric, who supplied the pastel drawings seen in
the film, created the box art for the DVD as well as the amusing
menus.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD includes an episode of the Independent Film Channel
documentary "With the Filmmaker: Portraits by Albert Maysles," about
Anderson and the making of the film. The DVD also features interviews
and behind-the- scenes footage; a fascinating examination of the
movie's art direction and production design; two rather
undistinguished deleted scenes; trailers; a talk-show spoof, "The
Peter Bradley Show," which features interviews with minor cast
members of the film; and commentary from Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   Among the interesting tidbits Anderson offers: The opening of the
film, which is a narrated montage of the Tenenbaums' early years, is
a tribute to Orson Welles' "The Magnificent Ambersons," and the title
sequence, in which each character is introduced, is based on the
opening of the 1934 fantasy "Death Takes a Holiday."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some of Hollywood's best-loved actresses of yesteryear--including
Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard,
Joan Fontaine and Mary Boland--headline "The Women," a sassy 1939
adaptation of the Clare Boothe Luce play that recently made its DVD
debut this week (Warner, $20).</TE>
<TE>   Though the story is badly dated, the dialogue crackles and the
performances--especially Crawford's and Russell's--are a joy to
watch. George Cukor directed. The DVD features two MGM shorts
previewing the studio's coming attractions for 1939 and 1940, and
alternative footage to the Technicolor fashion sequence.</TE>
<TE>   Also new from Warner is the underrated 1987 sci-fi comedy
"Innerspace" ($20). Dennis Quaid plays a test pilot who is
miniaturized for a medical experiment.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Joe Dante, the film won an Oscar for its
then-cutting-edge special effects. The disc features a new digital
transfer of the film and entertaining commentary from Dante among
others.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Though the jokes often miss, there are some wonderful moments in
the 1984 comedy "Top Secret!" (Paramount, $25), written and directed
by those wild and crazy "Airplane!" guys, Jim Abrahams, David Zucker
and Jerry Zucker. Val Kilmer, who is prettier than any of the
actresses in the movie, made his film debut in this sendup of spy
flicks.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the name Pisano registers only mildly to some, it resonates fairly
significantly in the world of jazz guitar. Nimble Los Angeles-based
guitarist John Pisano was a frequent collaborator with no less a
guitar hero than the late great Joe Pass for many years.</LD>
<LD>   More recently, Pisano was responsible for organizing a concert
series at the old Brentwood location of Rocco's.</LD>
<LD>   For many months, every Monday night in that inviting space up by
Mulholland Drive, guitar fans could count on hearing champions of the
straight-ahead jazz genre, usually in duet with Pisano, a host with
plenty of chops.</LD>
<TE>   Pisano also performs in cahoots with his wife, vocalist Jeanne,
the context for the guitarist's show Saturday as part of the "Music
Under the Stars" series at the Olivas Adobe. Pisano enjoys the
company of another guitarist, in this case Jim Fox, for an evening of
standards, originals and things Brazilian. Expect musicality,
fretboard gymnastics and sweet hot vocals.</TE>
<TE>   * The Flying Pisanos, with Jim Fox, Olivas Adobe, 4200 Olivas Park
Drive, Ventura, Saturday at 7:30 p.m. $15, general; $13, senior
citizens and children 12 and younger. (805) 658-4726.</TE>

<TE>   Plays Are the Thing: Theater-in-progress as a living, evolving
entity is the underlying theme of the Ojai Playwrights Conference.
Its fifth annual season begins Sunday at the Happy Valley School in
Ojai. The school's Zalk Theater will be the headquarters of a
weeklong roster of symposiums and readings of new plays.</TE>
<TE>   Open to the public, the readings include Luis Alfaro's "No Holds
Barrio," Kelly Stuart's "Mayhem," Arthur L. Kopit's "Discovery of
America," Jessica Goldberg's "Katzman and the Mayor" and Jon Robin
Baitz's "The Paris Letter."</TE>
<TE>   One feature of the conference is a weeklong workshop called "Why
Don't You Just Go Write a Play About It?," presented in association
with Ojai's small but mighty Highway 150, a living example of the
get-up-and-do-it theater sensibility.</TE>
<TE>   * Ojai Playwrights Conference, Zalk Theater at Happy Valley
School, 8585 California 150, Sunday- through July 28. $12 for
readings, $50 for conference series and $5 for symposiums. Call for

<TE>   Dog Ploy: A man, a woman and a beloved canine make up A.R.
Gurney's "Sylvia," summer fare at the Rubicon Theater. Gurney, who

when a fetching dog wins his affection.</TE>
<TE>   The acting talent arrives with Joe Spano of TV's "Hill Street
Blues" and "NYPD Blue" and Laurie Walters from "Eight Is Enough," who
star as the human couple. The starring pooch is Kristi Lynes, whose
resume includes, aptly enough, "Cats" on Broadway. Rubicon Artistic
Director James O'Neill directs.</TE>

<TE>   HoJo Homicide: The Vagabond Players dig into the murderous farce
genre with "Murder at the Howard Johnson's," opening Friday. Written
by Ron Clark and Sam Bobrick, the play deals with concurrent

<LD>8pm Theater</LD>
<LD>   In "Cooking," a comedy of (table) manners by L.A. Jewish Theatre
founder Jorge Albertella, Circe, the mythological sorceress who
turned men into pigs, now lives in an American city--and operates a
cooking school.</LD>
<LD>   "Cooking," L.A. Jewish Theatre, 1528 Gordon St., Hollywood, 8 p.m.
Regular schedule: Thursdays to Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m.
Ends Aug. 18. $18. (310) 967-1352, (323) 466-0179.</LD>
<TE>   8pm New Music</TE>
<TE>   "Two Evenings of New Music" begin with a solo performance by Josie
Roth on viola, voice and effects, assisted by the Illustrious Theater
Orchestra. The second of the two programs, called "Music From the
Autonomous Zone," is next Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Josie Roth and the Illustrious Theater Orchestra, Orange County
Center for Contemporary Art, 117 N. Sycamore St., Santa Ana, 8 p.m.
$7. (714) 667-1517.</TE>
<TE>   4pm Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   Paulina Rubio is suddenly everywhere, including Saturday's edition
of Reventon Super Estrella at the Arrowhead Pond. The show is Latin
pop's equivalent of the wide-ranging Wango Tango festival, which the
Mexican former kiddie pop star also played recently. In addition to
Rubio's frisky pop, the music runs from the moody rock en espanol of
Argentina's Enanitos Verdes to the energetic merengue of Puerto
Rico's Elvis Crespo. Others on the bill include Rabanes, Pilar
Montenegro, Aleks Syntek, Kabah and Fey.</TE>
<TE>   Reventon Super Estrella, Arrowhead Pond, 2695 E. Katella Ave.,
Anaheim, 4 p.m. $55 to $95. (714) 704-2500.</TE>
<TE>   2pm Theater</TE>
<TE>   "3 by Shakespeare's Skum," is the West Coast premiere of a trio of
Shakespeare parodies by Carolyn Spedden. "Tag Team Romeo and Juliet,"
"Leave It to Hamlet" and "Macbeth in 20 Minutes or Less" are
presented outdoors by the Culver City Public Theatre. Bring blankets
or low-profile lawn chairs for seating.</TE>
<TE>   "3 by Shakespeare's Skum," Paul Carlson Memorial Park, Motor
Avenue and Braddock Drive, Culver City, 2 p.m. Regular schedule:
Saturdays and Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends July 28. Free. (310) 712-5482.</TE>
<TE>   8pm Music</TE>
<TE>   Carl St.Clair conducts Beethoven's Ninth Symphony this week in the
Pacific Symphony's summer home, the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in
Irvine. Vocal soloists are Jane Jennings, Jennifer Roderer, Robert
Bracey and Derrick Parker. The contrasting first half of the outdoor
event is devoted to Mozart's Concerto for Two Pianos, K. 365, in
which the soloists are Arianna Goldina and Remy Loumbrozo.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Symphony, Verizon Wireless Amphitheater, 8808 Irvine
Center Drive, Irvine, 8 p.m. $19 to $72. (714) 755-5799.</TE>
<TE>   8pm Dance</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time, a lovesick imp named Assetniuq changed into
human form with the help of an evil shape-shifter named Melekelem.
But her transformation unraveled when Melekelem ran afoul of the
Royal Imp Jester and his protector, the good shape-shifter Abanaba.
We won't reveal how it all ended, but we can promise merriment and a
lesson about being yourself when the dancers of the Auricle Ensemble
and the percussionists of Looney Brooms get together to perform "Then
Came the Imps." The 50-minute "Imp Ballet" by Tim Bender and Jeanette
Wrate is the obvious main event, but the program also includes the
drum solo "Three Views of Rumi" and a whimsical showpiece for group
percussion titled "Harold's Hobo." Loquat-colored costumes are
featured in a definitive display of imp chic.</TE>
<TE>   Auricle Ensemble and Looney Brooms in "Then Came the Imps,"
Angel's Gate Cultural Center, Studio H, 3601 S. Gaffey St., San
Pedro, 8 p.m. Also Sunday, 7 p.m. $10. (562) 243-9105.</TE>

<TE>   * New this week: "John Q." is an all-stops-out rabble-rouser that
takes aim at the HMO hell that so many Americans have experienced
firsthand and drives home its message with the subtlety of a
sledgehammer. It also has the courage of its material and reveals
what it means to be a father and a husband in the fullest, most
uncompromising sense of the words. It doesn't hurt that the husband
and father in question is played by Denzel Washington, very much at
the top of his considerable form. Director Nick Cassavetes and writer
James Kearns know exactly how to shape their story into a dramatic
form that allows a raft of first-rate actors, including Robert Duvall
and Ray Liotta, to express it vividly.</TE>

<LD>Poet's obituary--An obituary of Venice beat poet John Thomas in the
April 7 California section incorrectly stated that he died at the
Veterans Administration hospital in Westwood. He had been treated
there earlier, but died at County-USC Medical Center. The obituary
also omitted some important facts that came to light after
publication of the story. At the time of his death on March 29 at age
71, Thomas was serving a 120-day jail sentence after he pleaded no
contest to a charge of sexually molesting his daughter in 1971 when
she was 14. His sentence included 60 months of probation, and he was
ordered to pay $200 in restitution. A change in state law lifting the
statute of limitations on unreported sex-abuse crimes in which the
victim was a child allowed him to be prosecuted.</LD>

<HD>Northrop Earnings Increase Solidly</HD>
<DH>Defense: Results of Pentagon contractors reflect rising
spending for weapons since terrorist attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defense contractors, led by Northrop Grumman Corp., posted strong
second-quarter earnings Wednesday as the industry continued to
benefit from an uptick in spending for weapons and homeland security
since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Northrop, Boeing Co. and General Dynamics Corp., the nation's top
defense contractors, reported better-than-anticipated earnings,
fueled mainly by new contracts and increases in sales of certain arms
such as smart bombs, missiles and unmanned spy planes used in
military operations in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   But defense analysts and company executives said Wednesday that
increases in defense spending so far have been gradual and moderate,
with the biggest gains yet to come. Congress is mulling over a 14%
increase in the nation's defense budget for fiscal 2003, the biggest
jump in two decades.</LD>
<TE>   "There have been spending increases in emergency bills [to fund
military operations] and for homeland security, but it's been in
drips and drabs," said Paul H. Nisbet, a defense analyst for JSA
Research Inc. "We haven't seen the real acceleration yet."</TE>
<TE>   Still, second-quarter earnings for most defense contractors were
better than what most analysts were expecting, fueling a surge in
defense stocks after steadily declining for nearly a week amid a
general slump in the stock market. Northrop shares rose $1.53 to
$110.03, Boeing climbed $2.07 to $42.94, and Lockheed Martin Corp.
rose $2 to $60, all on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   One exception was General Dynamics, whose shares fell to $90.16,
down $7.61, on the NYSE despite posting a 16% increase in earnings
and beating analysts' estimates. The maker of submarines and armored
vehicles posted net income of $263 million, or $1.29 a share,
compared with $227 million, or $1.12 a share, a year earlier.
Analysts said investors were worried about a large drop in backlog of
orders resulting from the company losing some key defense contracts
to competitors. A shrinking backlog could signal earnings problems
later, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Century City-based Northrop, maker of unmanned spy
planes, stealth bombers and aircraft carriers, said net income rose
4% to $182 million from $175 million a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding pension income and other items, operating income rose
60%, bolstered by a sharp increase in sales of military ships. The
results included Newport News Shipbuilding Inc., which Northrop
acquired last year to become the world's largest military
shipbuilder. Earnings per share was $1.53, compared with $1.28 a year
earlier. Sales rose 20% to $4.4 billion, compared with $3.7 billion a
year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The rise in defense spending also helped bolster Boeing, which has
been hammered by a slump in air travel since Sept. 11. Boeing
delivered 112 airplanes in the quarter, compared with 141 a year
earlier. Although Boeing reported a 7% drop in second-quarter
earnings, mainly because it delivered 29 fewer commercial aircraft,
the decline was less than anticipated thanks to a surge in earnings
from its defense and space businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Combined operating earnings from its military aircraft and space
and communications units surged 18% to $639 million from $540 million
a year earlier, offsetting a 17% drop at its commercial airplane
business.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing won two major multibillion-dollar contracts from the Army
in the quarter: designing a network of new lightweight vehicles and
weapons and developing a digital communications system.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing Chairman Phil Condit said Wednesday that he didn't expect
the commercial aircraft market to recover soon, although he expected
the slump to bottom out by next year.</TE>
<TE>   "This decline is significantly bigger than anything we've ever
experienced," Condit said.</TE>
<TE>   A slump in the telecommunications industry also hurt Boeing's
commercial satellite making operations in El Segundo, where the
company has been laying off employees. In a teleconference call with
analysts, Boeing executives acknowledged Wednesday that the unit's
operating profit dropped by $15 million in the quarter, though the
company would not disclose its overall profit. The results could have
been far worse had the company not significantly cut costs, they
said.</TE>

<HD>AMR Posts $465-Million Loss in 2nd Quarter</HD>
<DH>Earnings: American Airlines' parent warns of more losses if
fare discounts and reduced business travel persist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing a 15-year low in average ticket prices, American Airlines
parent AMR Corp. reported Wednesday a second-quarter loss of nearly a
half a billion dollars and warned of another "sizable" loss for the
third quarter if current trends persist.</LD>
<LD>   The world's largest airline indicated that those trends--slack
passenger traffic, heavy fare discounting and reduced business
travel--will persist through the end of the year. "Key business
markets remain very weak," Jeff Campbell, AMR's chief financial
officer, said in a conference call with analysts.</LD>
<LD>   The Fort Worth-based airline lost $465 million, or $3 a diluted
share, before a tax-related charge in the three months ended June 30.
That was in line with analysts' forecasts, but a dreary showing for
what usually is a strong quarter for the airline industry. Including
the charge, AMR's net loss was $495 million, or $3.19 a share.</LD>
<TE>   American and Continental Airlines--which reported a $139-million
quarterly loss Tuesday--set the stage for what is expected to be more
than $1 billion in total industry losses when the other airlines post
their second-quarter results later this week.</TE>
<TE>   American, like most big network carriers, faces problems on
several fronts. Travel demand still is down amid the lackluster
economy and the aftermath of Sept. 11. Profitable low-cost, low-fare
carriers such as Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways are
encroaching on American's market share. All these factors are putting
downward pressure on ticket prices and reducing American's revenue
and yield, or average fare. AMR said its second-quarter revenue
plummeted 20% from a year ago, to $4.5 billion from $5.6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "We continued to see a very weak revenue environment in the second
quarter, and although traffic has rebounded nicely since last fall,
average fares are at a 15-year low, sharply depressing yields," AMR
Chairman Donald Carty said.</TE>
<TE>   American has made some attempts this year to raise leisure fares,
but often has been forced to rescind the increases after other
carriers, mainly Northwest Airlines, have refused to match the higher
prices. Campbell still said the public should expect to "see us try
some things to see if we can make any progress" in pushing fares
higher.</TE>
<TE>   American also continues to cut costs and adjust its service to
reduce its losses. For example, the airline has been paring the
frequency of flights on some heavily traveled routes and moving those
jetliners to certain leisure markets, where passenger traffic is
growing. Even so, "I'd expect [overall] traffic for the third quarter
to be about flat" from a year earlier, Campbell said.</TE>
<TE>   AMR did end the quarter with a relatively strong balance sheet,
including $2.6 billion in cash. The airline's losses have continued
to narrow--from $798 million in last year's fourth quarter and $575
million in the first quarter of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, American said the Federal Aviation Administration
agreed to mediate its dispute with Long Beach Airport, which so far
has refused American's request for four more permanent slots at the
facility.</TE>
<TE>   Space at Long Beach is scarce because a noise ordinance limits the
number of commercial takeoffs to 41 a day. JetBlue has the rights to
the 27 remaining spaces, or slots, at the airport, an agreement
American says violates state and federal law.</TE>
<TE>   AMR's shares closed Wednesday at $12.87 a share, down 40 cents, on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Brokerages Struggle With Analyst Rules</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Regulators want more disclosure, but
compliance can be problematic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brokerages are struggling to comply with new disclosure rules adopted
in the wake of recent scandals involving securities analysts, and
some firms are going far beyond the rules to protect themselves from
charges of misconduct.</LD>
<LD>   The new regulations require that all Wall Street analysts
appearing on television and radio or at public forums detail, during
the appearance, any financial interest they or their firm may have in
the stocks they recommend. That would include whether their firm has
an investment banking relationship with a recommended company.</LD>
<LD>   Taking the idea a step further, some brokerages are pressuring
their analysts to make the same disclosures to newspaper and magazine
reporters, although the rules don't require that.</LD>
<TE>   At least one firm, Chicago-based William Blair &amp; Co., plans to
require reporters to sign forms promising that they will disclose
potential conflicts of interest in their stories before they can
interview a Blair analyst who is making a specific stock
recommendation.</TE>
<TE>   "We live in a society where there is a lot of suspicion about what
businesspeople are saying," said Art Simon, general counsel for
Blair, which has 26 stock analysts. "We're not trying to hide
anything here, and we want the public to know it. We're a
conservative firm."</TE>
<TE>   Brokerage analysts have faced heavy attack during the last year
for their aggressive stock touting during the late-1990s bull market.
Critics say analysts face inherent conflicts of interest when their
firm is seeking to provide lucrative investment banking services to
companies the analysts are supposed to be rating objectively.</TE>
<TE>   In April, New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer alleged that Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co.'s Internet stock analysts had touted publicly shares they
had slammed privately as "junk." Spitzer said the analysts had skewed
their recommendations solely to help Merrill's investment bankers win
business and thus had duped public investors.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill subsequently paid $100 million to settle the charges, and
agreed to restructure its research operations and disclosure
policies, though the firm didn't admit guilt.</TE>
<TE>   The new industrywide rules, drafted by the National Assn. of
Securities Dealers and the New York Stock Exchange and approved by
the Securities and Exchange Commission, are aimed at limiting how and
when analysts issue opinions on stocks, and require brokerages and
their analysts to publicly disclose more about their links to the
firms they recommend or pan. The rules took effect July 9.</TE>
<TE>   But the rules regarding analysts' conduct with the media cover
only appearances in electronic media, because it would be difficult
to enforce the requirements in print media, an NASD spokesman said.
An analyst might voluntarily disclose certain conflicts to a print
reporter, but if the reporter chose to leave out those details the
NASD has no authority to levy punishments on the press.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators can't punish electronic media, either, but the rules
are clear regarding enforcement for electronic media that might edit
out conflict-of-interest disclosures made during an interview. The
NASD "expects that an analyst will decline subsequent appearances,
absent assurances that the disclosures will not be edited out,"
according to an NASD background release on the rules.</TE>
<TE>   Also, brokerages are expected to keep records and tapes of all
appearances by their analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Some brokerages say they are considering broadening the scope of
the rules to include print media.</TE>
<TE>   "We are encouraging our analysts to make those disclosures in
print interviews," said Susan McCabe, spokeswoman for Merrill Lynch.
But unlike William Blair, Merrill has no plans to require reporters
to sign forms guaranteeing certain disclosures, McCabe said.</TE>
<TE>   At Blair, the forms that a print reporter would be asked to sign
are still being developed, officials said. The firm has yet to test
the plan because it hasn't faced a situation in which an analyst was
being interviewed about a specific stock recommendation (as opposed,
say, to being asked generically about an industry), officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Many experts say First Amendment issues make it unlikely that
print media would allow reporters to sign any document guaranteeing
certain commentary in a story.</TE>
<TE>   "We know it's cumbersome for print reporters," said Blair's Simon.
"But we're all operating on sketchy facts with these new rules. We're
scrambling to figure out how to best put them in place."</TE>
<TE>   At New York-based investment firm Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods, known
for its research on bank stocks, analysts and lawyers also are
struggling with how best to comply with the new rules. They have
discussed whether to ban analysts from talking to the press
altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "People are just so scared," said Mitchell Kleinman, Keefe's
general counsel. "That's why they're saying, 'We're just going to hit
this thing with an elephant gun.' "</TE>
<TE>   Kleinman said the firm may consider having an attorney present
during analyst-press phone calls. Keefe said it doesn't want to ban
press interviews, in part because many of its analysts are new and
are working to establish their reputations. The firm lost nearly all
of its research team when the World Trade Center collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   For print media, the issue of what is necessary disclosure is
thorny. A basic question is whether certain boilerplate disclosures
are relevant in a story when an analyst is discussing an industry or
is commenting on a firm without being asked to rate the stock.</TE>
<TE>   Also, many newspapers publish stories from wire services, such as
Reuters or Bloomberg News, which may not automatically include
disclosure of potential conflicts when analysts are quoted.</TE>
<TE>   Some reporters are diligent about requiring all
conflict-of-interest disclosures, and some may simply avoid quoting
an analyst where there is a conflict, but there is no industrywide
policy within the press, said Martha Steffens, a journalism professor
at the University of Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a key issue for business editors around the country,"
Steffens said. "The business press is going through some
soul-searching and thinking about our watchdog role."</TE>
<TE>   At the Wall Street Journal in New York, spokesman Steven Goldstein
said the newspaper has no policy specifically regarding quoting
analysts, but that the paper had "an existing practice of identifying
any conflict or other relevant motive of our sources."</TE>
<TE>   Conflict-of-interest identification is a "principal part of a
reporter's job," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At The Times, Business Editor Bill Sing said the newspaper seeks
to make sure any relevant conflicts are disclosed, but that so far
the paper has not insisted that potential conflict-of-interest
disclosure accompany every analyst reference.</TE>

<HD>Consumer Loans Boost Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Profits</HD>
<DH>Financial services: Net income climbs, but stock market
slump crimps investment banking results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. said lending to consumers
for home equity loans and mortgages drove up second-quarter profits.</LD>
<LD>   Citigroup, the world's largest financial services company, said
net income rose 15% to $4.08 billion from the same quarter last year.
J.P. Morgan, the top arranger of loans to U.S. companies, said profit
more than doubled to $1.03 billion from a year earlier, when its
earnings were depressed by venture capital losses.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. economy is helping bolster commercial banks' profits as
consumers increase spending through credit cards and take advantage
of low interest rates to seek new home financing. A stock market
slump cut investment banking revenue at J.P. Morgan by 35% and
reduced profit growth at Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney Inc. unit
to 4%.</LD>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan shares dropped 36 cents to a four-year low of $28.14
on the New York Stock Exchange after Chief Financial Officer Dina
Dublon said consumer banking revenue may have peaked in the second
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup shares rose 73 cents to $36.93, also on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup second-quarter net income rose to 78 cents a share from
70 cents in the same quarter a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Profit from Citigroup's credit card unit, the world's largest with
108 million accounts in 47 countries, rose 34% to $744 million.</TE>
<TE>   Citibank branch profit increased 26% to $748 million. Consumer
finance earnings, including home equity lending, rose 15% to $565
million.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan's net income rose to 50 cents a share from 18 cents a
year earlier, the first profit growth in two years. Earnings from
mortgage, auto lending and credit-card businesses and 530 branches
rose 60% to $686 million.</TE>
<TE>   Credit-card revenue increased 24% to $529 million as the bank
signed on almost 900,000 new accounts. J.P. Morgan had $49.5 billion
of credit-card loans at the end of the quarter, up 29% from a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Profit from mortgage lending was $268 million, more than double
that of a year earlier.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Specialty Laboratories Inc. said the federal government had
reinstated its right to bill Medicare and Medicaid as of June 19.</LD>
<LD>   Regulators charged earlier this year that the Santa Monica
company's laboratory testing was conducted by unlicensed staff, and
they suspended its ability to bill the government health insurance
programs. The company also was fined $3,000 a day, starting Feb. 22.</LD>
<LD>   Specialty Labs earlier this month cited the suspension and fines
in reporting a loss for the second quarter and the firing of about 80
employees, or 10% of its work force.</LD>
<TE>   The announcement was made after the markets closed. Specialty
Laboratories' shares fell 28 cents to $8.25 on the New York Stock

<DL></DL>
<LD>Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co. reported a drop in profit in the second
quarter but said it would earn more than expected in 2002 because
residential lot sales are at the high end of previous estimates.</LD>
<LD>   Net income fell 88% to $9.38 million, or 38 cents per partnership
unit, as revenue declined 50% to $52.2 million.</LD>
<LD>   The year-earlier results include revenue of $88.1 million related
mainly to the sale of the Chiquita Canyon Landfill and its option on
1,800 acres in Colorado, Newhall said.</LD>
<TE>   The limited partnership said it expects earnings of $1.50 to $1.60
a unit this year, up from earlier estimates of $1.10 to $1.15 a unit.
It expects to sell about 1,331 lots this year, compared with its
earlier estimate of 1,000 to 1,400.</TE>

<HD>San Bernardino Fires Pension Fund Manager</HD>
<DH>Benefits: Retirement board says AIM violated investment
guidelines and lost $55 million. The firm denies wrongdoing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Bernardino County Retirement Board said Wednesday that it
fired a Pittsburgh-based money manager, alleging that fraud by the
manager cost the county's employee pension funds $55 million in the
stock market's recent dive.</LD>
<LD>   The board said the loss, which amounted to 1.7% of the $3.2
billion in the funds, doesn't jeopardize the pensions of county
workers.</LD>
<LD>   "We caught this problem very early," said Timothy Barrett,
executive director and chief investment officer of the funds. "It's a
serious matter, but it will not have a long-term effect on the fund."</LD>
<TE>   The board said it terminated the contract of Advanced Investment
Management Inc. for allegedly violating county investment guidelines
in managing a stock index fund. The board is expected to meet today
in executive session to decide whether to file a lawsuit against the
firm.</TE>
<TE>   AIM, one of 16 investment firms the county has tapped to manage
fund assets, was hired in March to manage a so-called enhanced
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index account, the county said. The term
"enhanced" often means the investment is designed to move at a faster
rate than the market itself.</TE>
<TE>   On July 8, the county said, it became aware that AIM had used
"leverage" in the account, against county investment guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that AIM violated the investment guidelines in an
attempt to mask losses" as the stock market plunged in June, Barrett
said, though he said he could not elaborate on how the guidelines
were violated.</TE>
<TE>   AIM Chief Executive J. Thomas Allen said the firm "did not manage
the retirement account in a fraudulent manner. During the short time
the account was open, the board received regular reports....Nothing
was concealed from them. While the investment results of the account
were not up to our expectations under extreme market conditions, the
results achieved were within our permitted discretion."</TE>
<TE>   Allen declined to provide details of the structure of the index
account the firm used.</TE>
<TE>   The county administers the fund for workers such as clerks,
janitors, and police and fire employees. It pays benefits to 5,000
retirees.</TE>

<HD>Study: Drug Makers Focus on Promotion</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: A report says less is spent on R&amp;D than on
other costs. The industry calls the findings simplistic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A consumer health advocacy group blasted the pharmaceutical industry
Wednesday with a study saying drug makers spend far more on overhead,
lavish executive compensation and marketing campaigns aimed at
hospitals, doctors and patients than they do on research and
development.</LD>
<LD>   The report from Washington-based Families USA also scoffed at the
industry's boasts about the extent of its spending on new drug
development, arguing that the drug makers have dedicated far more
resources to "life-cycle" spending designed to develop new patents
for old drugs or to come out with slightly altered and more expensive
versions of older drugs in an effort to keep cheaper generic drugs
off the market.</LD>
<LD>   "The industry is paying much more attention to that now than it is
to breakthrough science," said Ron Pollack, director of Families USA,
a nonprofit organization that advocates "high-quality, affordable
health and long-term care for all Americans." Pollack said the
group's study showed that spending on marketing, advertising and
administration was often double that of R&amp;D for many large
pharmaceutical manufacturers.</LD>
<TE>   The pharmaceutical industry, backed by at least some Wall Street
analysts, fired back that the group's arguments and figures were
either dated, specious or simplistic.</TE>
<TE>   The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Assn. of America
trade group issued a statement saying: "The only way the
pharmaceutical industry critics are able to get a number higher than
$30 billion [the industry's total R&amp;D spending] is to lump in
'administrative costs' with advertising and promotion. What are
administrative costs? They are the operating costs that every
business in America has to pay such as state and federal taxes, the
electric bill, the trash collection bill, the copier repair bill, ...
rent and other costs of running a business."</TE>
<TE>   The trade group also noted that spending on research and
development has nearly doubled to $30.3 billion from $16.9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   But other researchers independently bolstered the consumer group's
arguments, saying that the industry has engaged in less hard science
than in the past and successfully spends billions on marketing and
persuasion.</TE>
<TE>   "The sales reps go door to door to the doctors' offices to bring
plenty of free samples for patients and materials to market their
products," said Dr. Meredith Rosenthal, lead author of a recent New
England Journal of Medicine article titled "Promotion of Prescription
Drugs to Consumers."</TE>
<TE>   "The drug companies spend the bulk of their promotional dollars on
the doctors with everything from notepads [to] free pens, and they
bring lots of study results to keep the doctors informed on
developments."</TE>
<TE>   Families USA said that Merck &amp; Co., for example, spent less than
$2.5 billion on R&amp;D last year but spent more than $6 billion on
marketing, advertising and administration. For the industry as a
whole, the study said promotional spending more than doubled from
1996 to 2001, from $9 billion to $19 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Merck spokesman Greg Reaves said that promotional activities
directed at doctors and patients were beneficial in that they helped
reach some of the millions of Americans who have high cholesterol,
for example, and persuaded them to visit their doctors and make
inquiries.</TE>

<HD>Ford Reports Profit Amid Restructuring</HD>
<DH>Autos: Modest gains are expected for the year as the firm
begins to recover from its poor performance in 2001.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Emerging from its disastrous financial performance last year, Ford
Motor Co. said Wednesday that it turned a profit in the second
quarter and probably would earn "a modest profit" for the year.</LD>
<LD>   A drastic restructuring program announced six months ago, after
Ford lost $5.45 billion last year, is starting to take effect,
although more belt tightening is needed, said Chief Financial Officer
Allan Gilmour.</LD>
<LD>   "The key to our success is to execute successfully our
revitalization plan in North America and Europe," Gilmour said in a
conference call. "But we are still far from our objectives."</LD>
<TE>   The world's second-largest auto maker recorded second-quarter
operating profit of $610 million, or 31 cents a share, contrasted
with a $551-million operating loss, or 30 cents a share, in the same
quarter last year.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's net profit was $570 million, or 29 cents a share. In the
year-earlier quarter, an extraordinary $3-billion pretax charge to
cover the replacement of millions of potentially defective Firestone
tires took Ford's net earnings to a $752-billion loss, or 42 cents a
share.</TE>
<TE>   The wrenching turnaround launched in January includes eliminating
10% of its workers and closing three North American factories.
Gilmour said that the company was not reaching targets for
eliminating vehicle costs and that Ford would decide on further
streamlining that could include additional job cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "Ford is huffing and puffing to meet its cost-reduction targets,"
John Casesa, industry analyst for Merrill Lynch, said Wednesday in an
investment note to clients. "Ford is making slow progress, but
progress nonetheless, in difficult conditions."</TE>
<TE>   Steven Girsky, Morgan Stanley's chief automotive analyst in New
York, said he is concerned "that profitability remains weak despite
strong industry demand. The competitive environment appears to be
getting more difficult, and the company's cost-cutting efforts appear
inconsistent."</TE>
<TE>   Ford's previous chief executive, Jacques Nasser, was ousted in
October in part because of the Firestone debacle but also because an
acquisition binge got Ford into non-core businesses such as auto
repair and Internet retail. Gilmour said Ford has raised $400 million
from the sale of non-core assets since the beginning of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Gilmour pointed to a number of positive gains for Ford in the last
three months, including a 12% improvement in a closely watched
quality study by J.D. Powers &amp; Associates; a $3.4-billion increase in
cash from the last quarter to $24.9 billion; gains in full-size sport
utility vehicle sales with the arrival of the redesigned Ford
Expedition and its sister luxury vehicle, the Lincoln Navigator; and
considerably stronger sales at Ford-owned Jaguar and Land Rover.</TE>
<TE>   Gilmour said Ford probably would post a loss for the third
quarter, traditionally the weakest of the year because of an annual
manufacturing shutdown in July and changeovers in some factories to
production of new models.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to expect a modest profit for the full year," said
Gilmour, a Ford veteran who was reappointed CFO two months ago after
being called back from retirement. "It will be small relative to the
size of Ford Motor Co."</TE>
<TE>   Ford shares rose 2 cents to $12.52 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Ford and General Motors Corp. shares have fallen sharply in recent
days on concerns that weak stock markets would drive up pension
costs.</TE>
<TE>   Both keep large portions of their multibillion-dollar pension
funds in stocks, and both assume high rates of return to fund future
obligations. GM had to inject $3.2 billion into its pension fund in
the second quarter, which was under-funded last year by $9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Gilmour said Ford's U.S. pension fund assets declined by 6.7%
through June 30, resulting in under-funding of $3.2 billion. Despite
the decline, he said Ford saw no changes to its 2002 pension expenses
and no need to make a cash contribution this year.</TE>

<HD>Southland Home Prices Hit Record Highs</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Shrinking housing supply helps boost June
median cost in L.A. County 18% from last year's level. O.C. sees a
19% increase.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home prices surged to another record high across a wide swath of the
Southland in June as falling mortgage rates and a tight supply of
housing continued to boost property values.</LD>
<LD>   The median cost of a Los Angeles County home jumped 18% from a
year ago to $269,000, marking the eighth consecutive month that the
county set a record price, according to a report released Wednesday
by DataQuick Information Systems Inc., a La Jolla-based firm that
charts real estate trends.</LD>
<LD>   In Orange County, the median price jumped 19% from a year ago to
$359,000, reflecting the sharpest rate of increase for any month
since May 1989, DataQuick said.</LD>
<TE>   "It's telling us the market is still rock-solid," said John
Karevoll, the analyst who compiled the data. "If you dig into the
details of the numbers, not just the fact that a record median was
set for Los Angeles and Orange counties, the sales counts and prices
are strong in all categories. In other words, there are no categories
of homes that are shaky."</TE>
<TE>   Despite that upbeat assessment, analysts warned that the current
rate of growth in home values is unsustainable. A primary reason for
the surge in values is that the pool of available homes is shrinking.
That statewide trend is more pronounced in Orange and Los Angeles
counties.</TE>
<TE>   Prices will be high enough within the next few months to encourage
a greater number of owners to put their homes up for sale, Karevoll
predicted. If that happens, the annual rate of appreciation should
edge down to about 12% to 15%. However, he said, the market should
remain too robust for prices to decline.</TE>
<TE>   Uncertainty over the national economy's strength and corporate
scandals on Wall Street could discourage prospective home buyers,
said Leslie Appleton-Young, chief economist for the California Assn.
of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Appleton-Young said, growth in employment in Los Angeles
County and the rest of the state will show gradual improvement over
the next few months and won't add much fuel to the housing market.</TE>
<TE>   The housing market remains a bright spot in the U.S. economy, with
most measures of demand still at robust levels.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate report Wednesday, the Mortgage Bankers Assn. of
America said homeowners flooded lenders with refinance requests last
week. Although the number of consumers who wanted loans to purchase
homes slipped from the previous week, demand remains strong.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said U.S. housing
starts in June declined nearly 4% from the previous month to an
annual rate of 1.67 million units. The results, which analysts
consider to be healthy, followed a spurt of almost 11% in May.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no evidence the strength in housing is any way impeded,"
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In the Southland, sliding mortgage rates in June drew buyers into
the market. Sales rose more than 9% from a year earlier in Orange
County, while falling more than 3% in Los Angeles County. But a year
ago, Los Angeles County experienced the best June since the late
1980s, and analysts said last month's decrease was the result of
fewer homes available for sale, not a slowing market.</TE>
<TE>   At the current pace of sales, the inventory of existing homes in
Los Angeles would be depleted in less than two months, down from
three months a year ago, according to the latest figures from the
California Assn. of Realtors. Orange County has a two-month
inventory, compared with a supply of more than 3 1/2 months at this
time last year.</TE>
<TE>   Tightening supplies and rising prices are raising barriers for
first-time buyers in Los Angeles and Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the number of purchasers with down payments of 5% or less
declined in both counties from a year earlier, suggesting that those
buyers are being priced out of the market, Karevoll said.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Post Gains, Snapping Dow's Losing Streak</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: The tech sector shows continued strength.
Analysts say market needs a sustained rally to attract buyers.</DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dow industrials on Wednesday struggled to their first winning
session since July 5, and the broad market also closed higher in
volatile trading.</LD>
<LD>   Continued strength in many battered technology stocks boosted
hopes that the market has reached at least a near-term bottom.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow closed with a gain of 69.37 points, or 0.8%, at 8,542.48,
though it had been up as much as 250 points early in the day.</LD>
<TE>   It was the first positive session for the Dow after losing 906
points, or nearly 10%, since July 8, and was the first time all major
stock indexes closed higher since July 5.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 added 4.99 points, or 0.6%, to 906.04,
inching up from Tuesday's five-year low.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite, dominated by tech stocks, rose 21.99 points,
or 1.6%, to 1,397.25. Nasdaq has gained 3.8% since reaching a
five-year low of 1,346 on July 10.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks have been hammered for the last eight weeks as corporate
financial scandals have depressed investor sentiment already weighed
down by concern about the economy and the threat of more terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The latest sell-off has left the S&amp;P 500 down 41% from its
all-time high reached in March 2000. That is the deepest decline
since the 48% loss in 1973-74. Nasdaq is down 72% from its peak.</TE>
<TE>   Now, "you're witnessing a pitched battle between two camps," said
Kevin Caron, market strategist at Ryan, Beck &amp; Co. in Livingston,
N.J. "You've got the bearish contingent concerned about accounting
scandals, and you've got value investors who are looking for
bargains."</TE>
<TE>   The market may have been responding positively Wednesday to
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who gave a second day of
congressional testimony on the economy. He repeated that he is
optimistic about the economy's prospects for continued recovery. "At
this moment, we are still on path.... We are poised for a reasonably
good expansion," he told a House committee.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan also said he doesn't believe that CEOs of all publicly
held companies should have to personally verify the accuracy of
company finances with federal regulators, as the Securities and
Exchange Commission now is requiring.</TE>
<TE>   Strong second-quarter earnings reports from a number of major
companies, including Citigroup and United Technologies, helped the
mood Wednesday, traders said. Citigroup rose 73 cents to $36.93.
United Technologies jumped $3.05 to $64.95. Both are in the Dow.</TE>
<TE>   Many tech stocks advanced, building on recent gains from multiyear
lows. Intel rose $1.08 to $19.44, Yahoo added 50 cents to $14.26,
Microsoft gained 75 cents to $52 and Cisco Systems was up 53 cents to
$14.80.</TE>
<TE>   But Apple Computer slid $2.23 to $15.63 and Broadcom fell $1.25 to
$19.74.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of major credit card companies plummeted on worries about
loan losses. Capital One Financial dived $20.12 to $30.48, and Metris
slid $2.22 to $3.85.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were encouraged that rising stocks outnumbered losers by
18 to 14 on the New York Stock Exchange and by 19 to 15 on Nasdaq, in
heavy trading.</TE>
<TE>   Also, a weekly survey of investment newsletter writers by
Investors Intelligence showed that the percentage of newsletters that
are bearish on stocks, 39.6%, has topped the percentage that are
bullish, 35.4%, for the first time since September. That is often a
"contrarian" indicator, meaning bearishness often reaches a peak just
before the market rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many analysts are reluctant to suggest that the market's
decline has halted for good, because stock valuations relative to
underlying earnings remain far above levels usually seen at market
bottoms.</TE>
<TE>   More immediately, the market needs to sustain a rally over a
number of days to attract more short-term buyers, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we need to do is get investor sentiment turned around. But
it's hard to do that because we can't get any continuity on the
upside here. This is the kind of market that just crushes the spirit
of investors," said Michael Murphy, head trader at Wachovia
Securities.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading Wednesday, the dollar was steady against the euro
and climbed modestly against the yen. Treasury bond yields were
mostly flat after surging Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe stock markets rebounded sharply. The German market
gained 2.9% and the British market jumped 4.2%.</TE>

<HD>Union Offers to Cut Jobs in Port Talks</HD>
<DH>Labor: To get better benefits, workers would accept
technology that could trim high-paid posts. Shipping lines say
proposal is not enough.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seeking to break a stalemate in contract talks covering West Coast
ports, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union has offered to
accept new technologies that it says would cut hundreds of high-paid
jobs in exchange for increases in wages and pension benefits.</LD>
<LD>   Union spokesman Steve Stallone said the 11-page proposal,
submitted Tuesday night, would save shipping lines at least $100
million a year through increased efficiencies and lower labor costs.</LD>
<LD>   The introduction of labor-saving technology at port terminals has
been the most contentious element of these contract negotiations.
Stallone said this proposal gives the Pacific Maritime Assn., which
represents shipping lines and cargo loading companies, what it says
it wants.</LD>
<TE>   "To a certain extent, we're calling them out, asking, 'Are you
really serious about negotiating?' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the PMA said the union's offer did not go far enough.</TE>
<TE>   "This proposal may have taken the ball a few yards down the field,
but there's a long way to go with time running out on the clock,"
said association President Joe Miniace. He said the association would
submit a counterproposal Wednesday evening, but would not provide
details.</TE>
<TE>   A source close to the talks said PMA negotiators believe the
number of union-covered clerical jobs actually would jump under the
proposal. That is because the union would expand its jurisdiction to
jobs that are sometimes performed by nonunion contractors, such as
planning the layout of a ship's cargo.</TE>
<TE>   The union said those jobs should be union under the existing
contract, and noted it has won more than a dozen arbitration cases on
the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The contract, which covers about 10,500 dockworkers, was due to
expire July 1 but has been extended by both parties on a day-to-day
basis since then.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations have been closely watched by retailers and
manufacturers across the country, who depend heavily on the movement
of goods to and from Asia and worry about the prospect of a strike or
lockout.</TE>
<TE>   Many had hoped a deal would be reached by Monday, when union
representatives gather for a long-planned caucus.</TE>
<TE>   Several observers close to the talks said that now appears
unlikely, although movement by both sides Wednesday indicates a deal
could be reached by the end of the month.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal is the union's first detailed response to the PMA's
calls for efficiency-boosting technology at West Coast ports.
Stallone said the ILWU spent "considerable time" writing it up, and
compared the document to a breakthrough union agreement that allowed
ports to convert to the use of truck-size containers in the early
1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the offer allows for the free flow of data
into the ports from shippers in Asia, trucking companies and other
sources.</TE>
<TE>   It proposes establishing "terminal control centers," operated by
marine clerks, to monitor the information. The number of clerks
staffing entry gates would be cut in half, as scanners and other
equipment automatically input data such as the container number into
the computer system.</TE>
<TE>   In supporting documents, the union repeatedly assures the PMA that
clerks will not retype information that is already in the computer--a
recurring complaint from the association. It also repeatedly insists
that any remaining clerical jobs, as well as any jobs created by the
new technology, be handled by marine clerks.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal covers only technology issues, and the union did not
specify improvements it wants in pension benefits or wages, which are
still being negotiated.</TE>
<TE>   About 2,100 marine clerk jobs are assigned daily at the 29 main
ports on the coast, including the ports of Los Angeles and Long
Beach, and the agreement would reduce those jobs by about 630 per
day, Stallone said. However, the union expects growth in cargo to
erase those losses within a few years.</TE>
<TE>   Clerks on average earned $118,000 last year, including overtime,
according to maritime association records.</TE>
<TE>   Longshore workers, the bulk of union members, earned an average of
$83,000 last year, while foremen earned $158,000.</TE>

<HD>Vacant Luxury Rooms With a View</HD>
<DH>Rentals: Some high-end coastal properties are languishing
as vacationers opt for fewer frills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Upscale vacation rentals on the Southern California coast that go for
thousands of dollars a week are not drawing enough paying guests to
suit their owners this summer, setting off a scramble to book them
before the sand turns cold.</LD>
<LD>   Reservations of luxury properties started slowly this year and
have continued to drag as some wealthy foreigners and well-heeled
Americans take a pass on extended stays at the beach.</LD>
<LD>   This is in contrast to the much bigger part of the vacation rental
market: smaller, less expensive homes with fewer frills. These homes
generally have been leased up.</LD>
<TE>   Some owners of luxury seaside retreats have taken the unusual
steps of cutting prices or offering an incentive of staying five
weeks for the price of four to lure last-minute renters.</TE>
<TE>   In Laguna Beach, Danielle Purcell showed a visitor through a
dramatic home where the turquoise waves of the Pacific nearly curl
into the living room and are easily seen through a wall of glass that
extends the length of the villa.</TE>
<TE>   She temporarily cut the monthly rent to $16,000 from $20,000, but
the house, along with several other costly rentals Purcell manages,
is available through early September. It is the first time in more
than a decade that she can recall a vacancy for a beachside home
during the peak season.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep lowering prices, but I have no tenants," said Purcell, an
agent at Village Rentals in Laguna Beach, as she headed down a spiral
staircase to the bottom floor. She shrugged her shoulders. "There's
nothing else I can do."</TE>
<TE>   Expectations were high this year for a brisk vacation rental
market, from high-end beach homes to low-end inland cottages. A poll
of more than 500 property managers nationwide predicted an 8% rise in
revenues from short-term rentals compared with a year ago, according
to the Vacation Rental Managers Assn., a Santa Cruz-based group.</TE>
<TE>   The upbeat view came despite a growing number of consumers,
particularly baby boomers in their peak earning years, who have been
pulling money out of the stock market or other investments to buy
second homes that can be turned into rentals, adding to the inventory
in many resort areas.</TE>
<TE>   But with the economy still laboring and travel concerns lingering
after Sept. 11, consumers have scaled back their plans for expensive
vacations, said Michael Sarka, the rental association's executive
director. The Travel Industry Assn. of America predicted only a 2%
increase in summer travel this year. That survey found tourists were
planning to take shorter trips, spend less money and stick closer to
home.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers also planned their trips later this year, Sarka said,
probably hoping to stretch their dollars further. Heading into
summer, many property firms nationwide found bookings were less than
90%, he said, leaving them concerned about whether the season would
be a financial success.</TE>
<TE>   Along the Southern California coast, from Santa Barbara to San
Clemente, property owners have reported mixed results. Although some
have seen a decline largely because of fewer affluent couples or
groups willing to rent exclusive homes, others have seen a steady
stream of families willing to rent more modest homes.</TE>
<TE>   On Catalina Island, mid-priced condominiums located off the beach
with a distant view of the Pacific Ocean lease for $1,400 a week and
remain 98% occupied by vacationers who return each year, said Kevin
Strege, owner of Catalina Island Vacation Rentals Inc. Overall, he
said, business has grown 10% from a year ago as more travelers opted
for shorter trips instead of flying to faraway places.</TE>
<TE>   With travelers staying closer to home, cottages in Oxnard renting
for $1,200 a week have been filling up with value-conscious visitors,
said Annette Schaefer, who operates Channel Island Realty in Oxnard.
Vacancies have remained on par with a year ago, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just about full," said Jim Jacobs, who heads Associated
Realty Services on Newport Beach's Balboa Peninsula, where mid-range
and upscale rentals have been more than 95% occupied this summer,
slightly ahead of the same time last year.</TE>
<TE>   But in other resort areas, vacancies in the upper-end were easier
to spot while more modest homes were hard to find.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Barbara, some owners of luxury properties have taken the
unusual step of negotiating monthly rates, as an estimated 10% stands
empty this season, said Gary Goldberg, who owns Coastal Getaways
Realty. In a couple of cases, he said, the price fell to $20,000 from
$25,000, as some homeowners were willing to cut rates 20% on
expensive units that usually are the first to be reserved.</TE>
<TE>   "People just aren't throwing their money around as much," Goldberg
said. "I think our high-end has been hit by the stock market more
than anything else."</TE>
<TE>   Despite fewer tenants, some owners are unwilling to budge on
prices. Around Malibu, a refuge of the entertainment elite, more than
50 high-end homes were available in July, double the usual number,
said Jay Rubenstein, manager of Coldwell Banker Malibu West, whose
agents handle rentals. Yet most Malibu-area owners of luxury homes
have held the line on monthly rents that range from $10,000 to
$100,000, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, more vacationers than usual have been signing up for one
month in top-of-the-line rentals rather than the whole summer, said
Jack Pritchett, owner of Pritchett-Rapf &amp; Associates, a real estate
brokerage in Topanga that also handles rental properties.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe they're just staying home one month and then splurging on
another month," he said. "It hasn't been that way in the past."</TE>
<TE>   In Laguna Beach, Purcell has found tenants willing to lease
lower-priced homes this summer. But demand has diminished for her
plush properties, she said, partly because renters from several
countries, including Saudi Arabia, who have flocked to Orange County
in the past haven't shown up.</TE>
<TE>   Struggling to fill the more expensive units, she has cut rents on
modest two- or three-bedroom homes by 15% to 20%, and sometimes more.
Purcell recently slashed the monthly rent on one unit to $7,000 from
$15,000. "It's better than leaving them empty," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But some property owners think otherwise. Steve Weldon owns a
four-bedroom, four-bath home with a swimming pool and guest house
only blocks from the ocean in Laguna Beach.</TE>
<TE>   He has stuck to his monthly rent of $30,000, money he normally
plows back into the property for improvements, even though his house
has drawn only one booking for this summer.</TE>
<TE>   The lone reservation came in late June, representing a drop from
three tenants he typically books during the peak season, mostly from
overseas or out-of-state vacationers.</TE>
<TE>   But Weldon, who owns an advertising firm in Laguna Beach and other
homes in Palm Springs and Big Bear, said less revenue won't be a
surprise.</TE>
<TE>   Of rents these days, he said, "We don't count on it."</TE>

<LD>PricewaterhouseCoopers has agreed to pay $5 million to settle
allegations by federal regulators that it broke rules meant to ensure
that auditors remain independent from the companies whose books they
oversee.</LD>
<LD>   PricewaterhouseCoopers neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing in
the settlement that the Securities and Exchange Commission announced.
The firm agreed to be censured for engaging in improper professional
conduct and to make changes in how it operates, the agency said.</LD>
<LD>   As a result of the independence rules violations, the SEC found
that 16 clients of PricewaterhouseCoopers submitted financial
statements from 1996 to 2001 that didn't comply with federal
securities laws. Avon Products Inc., for one, agreed to restate 1999
and 2001 earnings as a result.</LD>

its patents to create a version of Fosamax, a drug that treats bone
loss associated with age.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for Merck say in a lawsuit filed Monday in federal court

and 2001, and has applied to the Food and Drug Administration to sell
a generic version of Fosamax in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Whitehouse Station, N.J.-based Merck rose 49 cents to

<LD>In a move to restore investor confidence in Vivendi Universal, the
company's new management team has named a respected French TV
executive as its new chief financial officer.</LD>
<LD>   Jacques Espinasse, chief operating officer at French satellite TV
consortium TPS, faces a daunting task as Vivendi copes with a cash
crunch and an investigation by French regulators into its financial
communications with investors. The company recently secured a
$1-billion loan with banks and is said to be negotiating a second
loan for $2 billion to $3 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The 59-year-old executive replaces Guillaume Hannezo, who had
close ties to former Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier, ousted in a
boardroom coup two weeks ago.</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi said Hannezo, whose departure was widely expected, will
serve as an advisor to its new chairman and current CEO, Jean-Rene
Fourtou, for six months.</TE>

<LD>Capital One Financial Corp. shares plunged, leading other credit card
stocks lower, after the fifth-largest U.S. issuer of Visa and
MasterCard said regulators required it to increase reserves for loan
losses.</LD>
<LD>   Capital One shares fell $20.12, or 40%, to $30.48 on the NYSE.</LD>
<LD>   Federal regulators are scrutinizing lenders that expanded during
the economic growth of the 1990s by going after customers with bad
credit backgrounds and charging rates of 20% or higher.</LD>
<TE>   Some investors said they were surprised that Capital One, which
has had the lowest default rate among the top 10 U.S. credit card
issuers since a recession took hold early last year, was forced to
boost reserves.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators said they were concerned Capital One might be growing
too fast. The Falls Church, Va.-based company increased loans at an
annual rate of 35% in the first six months of this year.</TE>

<HD>Music Companies Seek New Piracy Protection</HD>
<DH>Technology: Recording group wants to develop a way to
prevent Internet radio songs from being redistributed online.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS and JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Opening a new front in the war against digital music piracy, major
record companies are asking computer and electronics manufacturers to
help stop consumers from sharing songs copied from online radio
broadcasts.</LD>
<LD>   The Recording Industry Assn. of America, the industry's main trade
group, wants to develop an "audio performance flag," similar to the
"broadcast flag" technology being developed to protect digital
television programs, Mitch Glazier, senior vice president of the
RIAA, disclosed Wednesday at a Commerce Department meeting on piracy.</LD>
<LD>   The goal is to prevent music transmitted by an Internet radio
station from being redistributed over the Internet. The flags would
act as markers that tell devices not to move any part of the
broadcast back onto the Internet.</LD>
<TE>   This approach would require changes to millions of computers and
other Internet-connected devices. Because computers convert digital
audio files to analog in order to play them, it may be impossible to
stop pirates from making fresh recordings with no digital
protections.</TE>
<TE>   Internet radio is not a significant source of piracy today, in
part because of its inferior sound quality when compared with CDs.
But as high-speed Internet connections proliferate and broadcasting
costs drop, online stations are expected to shift to higher-fidelity
feeds.</TE>
<TE>   Glazier said the RIAA has held "very limited, preliminary
discussions" with people in the consumer electronics and information
technology industries, but the talks haven't progressed far. The next
step, he said, is to ask industry groups and companies more formally
to get involved.</TE>
<TE>   The latest effort is one of half a dozen or more by the labels and
Hollywood studios, which are eager to deter piracy with technology.
Others include inter-industry efforts to stop digital movie files
from being copied and to prevent digital TV programs from being
transmitted online.</TE>
<TE>   Yet another set of discussions is expected to start in the next
few weeks, as the Hollywood studios hold high-level talks about
piracy with a group of leading computer and information technology
companies. The companies offered to meet with the studios if the
discussions also included non-technological approaches to piracy,
such as giving consumers a legitimate source of movies online. The
Motion Picture Assn. responded late Tuesday with an offer to meet
"with no preconditions."</TE>
<TE>   Under federal copyright law, online broadcasters can automatically
obtain licenses to the labels' music if they follow certain rules for
playlists. They have to pay royalties, but the amount--0.07 cent per
song per listener--is much lower than they would have to pay for an
on-demand service.</TE>
<TE>   If users record those broadcasts and send the songs over the Net,
Glazier said, it undermines the distinction between free or low-cost
online radio and on-demand services. That's why the RIAA wants to put
some kind of digital marker into Webcasts to prevent them from being
redistributed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although streams aren't a major piracy problem, the RIAA has an
interest in preserving a range of distribution options, said Jonathan
Potter of the Digital Media Assn., which represents online audio and
video services. "Our industry is all in favor of there being several
different types of business with several different price points,"
said Potter, DiMA's executive director.</TE>

<HD>IBM Squeezes Out a Quarterly Profit</HD>
<DH>Technology: A slump in purchases by struggling companies
drops revenue to $20 billion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IBM Corp. said Wednesday that it eked out a second-quarter profit of
3 cents a share as it took a $1.4-billion charge to cover job cuts
and write-offs.</LD>
<LD>   Earnings at IBM, whose products range from software to microchips
to computer services, fell sharply even without the big charge, as
corporations concerned about their own bottom lines cut back on
technology spending.</LD>
<LD>   The Armonk, N.Y.-based company earned $56 million in the quarter
ended June 30, down from $2 billion, or $1.15 per share, in the
second quarter last year. Without the one-time items, IBM would have
earned 84 cents a share, 1 cent more than analysts surveyed by
Thomson First Call expected.</LD>
<TE>   Total revenue fell to $20 billion from $20.8 billion in the
year-ago period. Chief Financial Officer John R. Joyce said IBM was
hurt by a slump in purchases by struggling technology companies.</TE>
<TE>   IBM shares rose $1.68 to $70.69 on the New York Stock Exchange
before the firm issued its earnings. The stock rose as high as $73.20
after the report, though shares still are off 42% for the year.</TE>
<TE>   In other earnings Wednesday:</TE>
<TE>   * Advanced Micro Devices Inc. posted a second-quarter loss of $185
million as it continued to struggle with weak demand and strong
competition from Intel Corp. The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based chip maker
said sales of its Athlon and Duron microprocessors were down 35% in
the quarter compared with 2001. AMD's loss amounted to 54 cents per
share, compared with a profit of $17.4 million, or 5 cents a share,
in the same period a year ago. Overall sales for the quarter fell 39%
to $600.3 million, down from $985 million last year. Analysts were
expecting a loss of 45 cents a share on sales of $600 million. AMD
also said it expects microprocessor sales to pick up in the current
quarter, though not enough to prevent another loss.</TE>
<TE>   * Fear of computer viruses led Symantec Corp. to a first-quarter
profit of $56.6 million, or 36 cents a share, compared with a loss of
$21.2 million, or 14 cents a share, a year earlier. The Cupertino,
Calif.-based maker of Norton anti-virus software reported sales of
$316 million in the three months ended June 30, up from $228 million
last year.</TE>
<TE>   * Handspring Inc., the maker of Treo hand-held computers, narrowed
its fourth-quarter loss to 11 cents a share as its gross margin
improved. The Mountain View, Calif.-based company reported a net loss
of $15.4 million, down from $67.2 million, or 60 cents a share, a
year earlier. Sales fell 20% to $49 million from $61 million.</TE>
<TE>   * FileNet Corp., a Costa Mesa document-management software maker,
posted net income of $1.7 million, or 5 cents a share, for its second
quarter, contrasted with a loss of $10.7 million, or 30 cents a
share, for last year's second quarter. Sales rose 7% to $88.2
million.</TE>
<TE>   * Inktomi Corp., a Foster City, Calif., maker of Internet search
software, said its fiscal third-quarter net loss widened to $235.7
million, or $1.62 a share, compared with $155 million, or $1.22 a
share, a year earlier. Revenue in the three months ended June 30 fell
40% to $23.8 million from $39.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Online bank and brokerage company ETrade Group Inc., based in
Menlo Park, Calif., reported quarterly operating income of $38.8
million, or 11 cents per share, up from $5.4 million, or 2 cents a
share, in the same period last year. Revenue rose to $316.1 million
from $308.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Commerce One Inc., which makes e-commerce software, said its
second-quarter net loss narrowed to $71.1 million, or 25 cents a
share, from a loss of $2.07 billion, or $9.02 a share, a year
earlier. The Pleasanton, Calif.-based firm's sales dropped 73% to
$27.8 million from $101.3 million.</TE>

<HD>5 Killed in Tel Aviv Bombings</HD>
<DH>Israel: Two suicide attackers and three others die; 40 are
hurt. Many victims appear to be foreign workers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS and HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>TEL AVIV</DL>
<LD>Two suicide attackers set off explosions Wednesday night in a rundown
commercial neighborhood here frequented by foreign workers, killing
at least three other people and wounding about 40, police reported.</LD>
<LD>   The twin explosions ripped through the Neve Shaanan area, near Tel
Aviv's former central bus station, shortly after 10 p.m. Most
nightspots were closed as Israelis observed Tisha B'Av, a day of
mourning that marks the dispersions of the Jewish people following
the destruction of the First and Second temples in Jerusalem.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses said they heard a blast near the entrance to an open
coffee shop favored by immigrant workers from Romania.</LD>
<TE>   "There was an explosion, a couple of moments of quiet, and then
another one," said Yelena Malayev, 18, a student who said she and a
friend had walked past the site moments before the bombs went off.
Malayev said they rushed back to a scene of devastation, where bodies
were strewn on the ground and the injured were screaming.</TE>
<TE>   The attack, the first suicide bombings inside Israel since the
army reoccupied much of the West Bank last month, came a day after
Palestinian gunmen ambushed a bus carrying Jewish settlers to the
settlement of Emmanuel, in the northern West Bank. Eight Israelis,
including two infants, died in that ambush.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, President Bush, who is scheduled to discuss
the Middle East crisis today with the foreign ministers of Saudi
Arabia, Egypt and Jordan, offered his sympathy for the victims of the
attacks and said, "The American people and I condemn these despicable
acts of terror."</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian Authority also issued a statement condemning the
attack, but charged that Israel was responsible for "creating ... the
suitable atmosphere for such operations, which we condemn and
reject."</TE>
<TE>   Al Manar, the television station of the Lebanese Shiite militia,
Hezbollah, said it received a claim of responsibility for the attack
from the militant group Islamic Jihad. The claim could not be
verified.</TE>
<TE>   By law, Israeli restaurants, cafes and places of entertainment are
closed on Tisha B'Av, but a handful of open cafes in Neve Shaanan
were crammed with foreign workers Wednesday after the mourning period
began at sundown. The attackers reportedly were less than 100 feet
apart when the bombs they apparently carried in bags went off seconds
apart, spewing nails and other metal fragments.</TE>
<TE>   The first rescue workers to arrive said the street and sidewalks
were littered with bodies. Police said at least one of the dead was a
foreign worker, and an ambulance driver said many of the injured
appeared to be foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai said that many of the 60,000 to 80,000
foreigners working in the city live in the Neve Shaanan neighborhood.
Israel has gradually replaced many of the Palestinians from the West
Bank and Gaza Strip who used to do menial labor with workers from
other lands. There are believed to be about 300,000 foreign workers
living in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Huldai said the city opened its help center for foreign workers
immediately after the blast. "Unfortunately, we are already
experienced," he told Israel Television.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen of the injured were taken to nearby Tel Aviv Medical
Center, where one later died, hospital officials said.</TE>
<TE>   From her gurney in the hospital, 18-year-old Hanit ben Abu said
she and two friends were sitting at an outdoor table in the shopping
strip when they heard a blast.</TE>
<TE>   "We ran toward the first explosion, and then there was the second
and I felt the heat on my face," Ben Abu said.</TE>
<TE>   In her confusion, Ben Abu ran into the street and was hit by a
car. She was lightly injured.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think this would happen to us," said her sister, Smadar,
who was at her side in the hospital. "Just make it stop."</TE>
<TE>   Two hours after the blast, the uncovered body believed to be that
of one of the bombers lay on a pedestrian strip under a still-lighted
shop sign flashing "Have a Good Time," an advertisement for Time
cigarettes. Plastic tables and chairs lay on their sides outside the
small cafes that bore the brunt of the blasts, and the street and
sidewalk were carpeted with debris.</TE>
<TE>   Israel is being used "as a testing ground" by militants, Public
Security Minister Uzi Landau said at the scene. "If, God forbid, they
should be successful, these weapons, these means, will be exported to
the rest of the Western world."</TE>
<TE>   Landau defended police efforts to thwart such attacks, telling The
Times that security forces have "absolutely been effective, but in a
war, sometimes you get hit."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before the Tel Aviv attack, Israeli warplanes fired
rockets into a metal factory in the central Gaza Strip, in what the
army said was a strike against a facility that manufactured mortar
shells and rockets. Palestinians have fired hundreds of mortars at
Jewish settlements in Gaza, and have sometimes fired them inside
Israel's pre-1967 borders, but they rarely cause damage or injury.</TE>
<TE>   In another incident Wednesday night, soldiers shot to death one
Palestinian and possibly injured another, who escaped, as they tried
to cross into Israel near the northern West Bank town of Kalkilya. An
army spokesman said the military believed that the pair were
attempting to carry out an attack inside Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The army launched a manhunt for the suspect who escaped, searching
inside Israel's pre-1967 borders. He reportedly was captured shortly
after midnight.</TE>
<TE>   In yet another incident Wednesday night, Israeli troops battled
gunmen from the Tanzim militia, which is linked to Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, in a village near
Nablus, east of Kalkilya. The army reported that two gunmen were
killed and two injured. The army said it found an explosives lab in
the building where the firefight erupted.</TE>
<TE>   The government recently began constructing a series of walls,
barricades and trenches that runs roughly along the pre-1967 borders,
and to the east of it, bowing to public pressure to fence the West
Bank off from Israel, as it has done with the Gaza Strip. The barrier
is expected to take months to complete.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before midnight Wednesday, the Defense Ministry issued a
statement saying that Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer had
canceled measures he had authorized earlier in the day that would
have alleviated the economic pressures faced by Palestinians,
including allowing more Gaza residents to work in Israel.</TE>

<LD>   Hundreds of unarmed women seized control of at least four more
ChevronTexaco facilities in the Niger Delta, even as the occupation
of the Escravos terminal by other village women ended.</LD>
<TE>   The occupations were spurred at least in part by the crushing
poverty in which villagers live amid the region's oil wealth.</TE>
<TE>   The women involved in the latest takeovers were refusing to leave
until they had met with senior company executives to press their
demands for jobs and community improvements. The actions mirrored the
takeover of the Escravos terminal, which began last week, but a
protest leader said the demonstrations were unrelated.</TE>

<HD>German Ruling Upholds Gay Marriage</HD>
<DH>Rights: Three states that challenged the law say the
decision is a blow to the nuclear family.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Legal recognition of same-sex marriages presents no threat to
heterosexual couples, Germany's Constitutional Court ruled Wednesday
in a blow to conservatives who have waged a campaign for traditional
family values in this emotionally charged election season.</LD>
<LD>   Conservatives in the three states that challenged the year-old gay
marriage law conceded defeat but continued to loudly lament what they
see as deterioration of official support for the nuclear family.</LD>
<LD>   Bavarian Gov. Edmund Stoiber, who is challenging Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder for national leadership in the Sept. 22 election,
called the high court ruling "regrettable." But he said he and his
rightist political allies would not seek to repeal the gay rights
legislation if they win the election.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, liberal Berlin celebrated the legal milestone in this
country where Nazis once persecuted homosexuals, who until 1969 were
defined as criminals.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Klaus Wowereit, Germany's most prominent openly gay
politician, praised the decision as "a meaningful contribution to
ending centuries of discrimination."</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder's Social Democrats and their coalition partners, the
Greens, also heralded the ruling as validation of the social policies
defining the center-left government, which is facing a tough
reelection battle.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin said the court's 5-3
decision to uphold the constitutionality of gay unions was proper and
urged Stoiber and his conservative allies in the Christian Democratic
Union to cease their parliamentary and legal blockade of other
legislation meant to enhance gay rights.</TE>
<TE>   The Constitutional Court challenge was brought by the states of
Bavaria, Saxony and Thuringia, all governed by conservatives who
contended that legal status for gay marriages violated the 1949 Basic
Law's protection of marriage and family.</TE>
<TE>   In its ruling, the court said that "marriage is neither damaged or
in any other way restricted" by the new law. Gay marriages are also
recognized in Denmark, Sweden, France and the Netherlands.</TE>
<TE>   "This is everything we have wished for," Axel Blumenthal of the
Lesbian and Gay Assn. of Germany said. He predicted that thousands
more same-sex couples will join the 4,400 pairs married since the law
took effect Aug. 1, 2001, now that their legal rights have been
affirmed.</TE>
<TE>   The law allows gays to wed at government registry offices, extends
inheritance and insurance rights to both partners and requires a
legal decree of divorce in the event of the relationship's
dissolution.</TE>
<TE>   Legislation is pending in the Bundestag, the lower house of
Parliament, that would accord the same tax privileges to gay
marriages as to heterosexual couples.</TE>
<TE>   All major political parties except the CDU and their Christian
Social Union allies in Bavaria hailed the ruling as a positive step
toward guaranteeing equal rights.</TE>
<TE>   Stoiber this month named a 28-year-old unwed mother as his social
policy advisor in a bid to improve his standing in the former
Communist east and among women. But the choice of Brandenburg state
legislator Katherina Reiche as his aide angered many traditionalists
in his party. That may explain her about-face on gay rights: In an
interview Wednesday in the conservative Die Welt daily, she deemed
such unions unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   Roman Catholic Church leaders have long opposed the recognition of
gay partnerships as legal marriages and refuse to sanctify the unions
with church rituals.</TE>
<TE>   The Catholic Bishops Conference in Germany lamented the upholding
of gay marriage as constitutional. Cardinal Karl Lehmann warned that
equating homosexual marriage with the sacramental state between a man
and a woman constitutes "damage to society."</TE>

<HD>Taliban's Shadow Falls Across Women Jailed for Crimes of
Love and Defiance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Wrapped in blankets and bright scarves, the six inmates were
scattered like wallflowers on the side of a cell inside the women's
prison here.</LD>
<LD>   There was Marzia, 28, whose 55-year-old husband won't give her a
divorce. She claimed that he chained her feet and locked her in a
small damp room in his house for a month.</LD>
<LD>   There was Nilofar, 16, and Fariba, 19, who fell in love with boys
next door, and tried to elope. When Fariba refused to marry a cousin,
she said, her father threatened to "chop me up and give me to my
cousin in pieces"--while the cousin sent her a message in jail that
he would kill her as soon as she was freed.</LD>
<TE>   On Nov. 13, when the Taliban left Kabul, the women's jail emptied.
But in the last six months, women and teenage girls have started
trickling back in, arrested for many of the same crimes that got them
jailed during the Taliban era.</TE>
<TE>   Of 29 current prisoners, 60% were jailed for eloping or leaving
their homes, and 20% were accused of adultery. There was one charged
with murder, one with theft and a third charged with selling her
married daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Western pressure for greater attention to the rights of
women in Afghanistan, the legal system remains a great question mark.
Many laws pertaining to women have not changed in Afghanistan, and
there is confusion in legal circles and among investigators as to
what the law actually is.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan now runs under a dual legal system, with both Sharia,
or Islamic law, and some parts of the civil code that existed before
the Taliban took control in 1996 and did away with all the
contemporary laws, legal records and books.</TE>
<TE>   But Martin Lau, an Islamic law specialist at the University of
London's School of Oriental and African Studies, said some offenses,
such as the "honor crimes" in which male relatives kill females for
dishonoring the family, are more a matter of tradition than law.
"It's custom here. It's not Islamic law," he said in a recent
interview in Kabul, the capital. "There is nothing in Islam that says
a betrayed husband has the right to take the law into his own hands."</TE>
<TE>   Sherin Aqa Manawee, deputy of Afghanistan's Supreme Court, said
that under Sharia law, a man or woman is entitled to choose a spouse,
provided neither is engaged--and the woman's father has no legal
right to interfere.</TE>
<TE>   But it rarely works out that way. The law clashes with the
long-held Afghan tradition that families select the spouse. Women and
girls who run away from the homes of their fathers, husbands or other
male relatives are arrested and taken to jail, where they stay unless
claimed by a male relative.</TE>
<TE>   Lau was in Kabul recently on a project for the International
Commission of Jurists, a Geneva-based human rights group of legal
experts, to examine the compatibility between Afghanistan's law and
international human rights standards. But he said there were
contradictions between judges and legal experts about what laws are
in force.</TE>
<TE>   "Just trying to find out what the substantive law is, is
impossible," he said. "There seems to be a huge amount of legal
uncertainty."</TE>
<TE>   Lives Ruled by Relatives</TE>
<TE>   The detention of women for running away from home is part of a
culture that treats them as though they were minors, their lives
ruled by their male relatives. Under the law applied by the Taliban
and still widely in force, a woman has to be represented by her male
guardian or husband in all legal proceedings. In a country where clan
connections are all-important, a woman must rely on her male
relatives to push her cause with police and court officials. For
Afghan women, the legal system is opaque and terrifying.</TE>
<TE>   In the corridor of the nearby Kabul Police Department one evening
last month, a girl of perhaps 16 or 17 waited, her blue burka hitched
up to reveal a round face with frightened eyes.</TE>
<TE>   In a tremulous, birdlike voice she revealed that she had no
parents. She had fled her step-uncle's home in the northern city of
Mazar-i-Sharif to avoid being married off to a shoe repairman, and
surrendered to the police who moved her to the women's jail in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Now she was being freed, handed over to a man who claimed to be
her uncle. The girl said he was her late father's god-brother.</TE>
<TE>   In a few confused minutes, she was hustled away by the man, who
refused to speak. They disappeared into the dense Kabul night.</TE>
<TE>   Under Sharia law, a man's word is worth twice that of a woman's.
Convincing a court that she has been beaten by her husband or raped
or needs a divorce is difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Under Sharia law, a woman or girl who reports a rape but fails to
prove that she did not consent may risk a charge of fornication.
Rana, 40, Kabul's senior female police investigator, who also held
the position under the Taliban, argued that rape is physically
impossible and that the crime therefore cannot exist. Rana is
responsible for investigating all crimes involving females. Peering
through thick, black-rimmed spectacles, she drew a strange analogy,
comparing rape with a needle and thread.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you force the thread through the needle if the needle is
jerking around?" she argued, suggesting that no man could force sex
upon any female who really struggled.</TE>
<TE>   Marzia spent eight months in prison because she wants a divorce. A
month ago she was released pending the divorce trial, but she may be
sent back to her husband, if the court refuses a divorce. Now she
lives with her one male relative, a 95-year-old uncle.</TE>
<TE>   She's been twice married. Her first husband married a younger
woman, divorced Marzia, and he and his new wife took her 2-month-old
girl. She never saw the child again.</TE>
<TE>   When she was 18, a shopkeeper 27 years her senior took her as his
second wife, but she claims that he never consummated the marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he'd not married me to have children. He'd married me to
work for his first wife," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Several years later, in pre-Taliban times when the government of
Burhanuddin Rabbani ruled Kabul, bringing in fundamentalist Islam,
she tried to get a divorce. Her husband refused and had her jailed
for 18 months. Eight months ago, Marzia said, she again sought a
divorce after her husband, who she said was often angry and violent,
chained her in a dark, wet room.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hungry and thirsty. The other wife brought me something
secretly," she explained. "I respect her very much, like a mother."</TE>
<TE>   When her husband objected again to divorce, she ran away. He went
to authorities and had her jailed a second time. The investigator,
Rana, corroborated Marzia's version, explaining that her husband, the
shopkeeper, was a powerful figure with good connections.</TE>
<TE>   After returning to her husband's house the first time, Marzia
said, he beat her frequently, "almost every day."</TE>
<TE>   "If I'd have argued with him, that would be one thing," she said.
"But I never spoke out against him. I never screamed, because I was
frightened. I felt guilty. I felt ashamed. I was very afraid that he
would kill me."</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, she said, he broke her ribs with a full Coca-Cola
bottle because she put fresh yogurt into a bowl instead of leaving it
in a bag in a cool place. Another time he hit her with the handle of
a shovel.</TE>
<TE>   Manawee, the Supreme Court deputy, said "even a woman" is entitled
to a divorce under Afghan law if her reasons are logical.</TE>
<TE>   Rana, however, said that obtaining a divorce is difficult if the
husband objects. She predicted that the court will simply advise the
husband not to be cruel to his wife, and will send Marzia back to
him.</TE>
<TE>   Rana said a woman typically needs males in the family to testify
to violence against her, or neighbors who have heard her screams.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately," she said with a sigh, "in our country [divorce]
is all left up to the men."</TE>
<TE>   Manawee, 35, appointed to the Supreme Court after the fall of the
Taliban, believes that getting a divorce should be difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you noticed the problem in the West, that there's more
divorce cases in foreign countries than in Afghanistan? We don't want
these unfavorable changes or the experiences that Westerners face,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although widows can choose whom to marry, single women
traditionally have no say. Many young men have no choice either. The
match is arranged by their parents.</TE>
<TE>   The girls and young women jailed in Kabul for eloping have all the
defiant love and bravery of Jane Austen heroines, but come across as
very shy. Nilofar, from provincial Ghorband, hung her head and
retreated under a long pale blue shawl, as she told the story of her
love for Anjamuddin, 20, a driver who lived next door. She said she
was determined not to marry the cousin her father chose: "When my
mother married a relative, she did not have a good life. My sister
also married my father's relative, and she is not happy either."</TE>
<TE>   The couple saw one another over an adjoining wall and whispered
for two hours each night. Finally, they ran away but spent only nine
hours together before they were arrested at a relative's home.</TE>
<TE>   "If no one caught them, they'd keep on talking," said the male
prison chief, Diwane Amneyat Ama, who, along with Rana, insisted on
being present during interviews with the prisoners and often answered
for the women.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't afraid," said Nilofar, who did not expect to be jailed
for running away for love.</TE>
<TE>   The prison chief scoffed: "She thought she'd get married easily!"</TE>
<TE>   At times paralyzed into silence by her shyness, Nilofar
nonetheless insisted that she was not bowed by what had happened.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's a scandal for the family, but I do not regret it for
any reason. I still want to marry him," she said in her cell in
April. But Rana said the family would never agree to the marriage,
and added that there was a risk the male relatives would kill the
girl.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether she wanted to be a good wife and mother, or if she
wanted other things as well, Nilofar did not have a chance to answer.
"What can she be?" said Rana, amazed at the question. "She's not
educated. What can she be except a homemaker?"</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the older woman was proved right. Nilofar's will broke
while she was in prison, and she bent to her father's demand to give
up the boy she loved and marry the cousin she does not. As soon as
she agreed, one month ago, she was freed.</TE>
<TE>   A Five-Year Sentence</TE>
<TE>   Fariba was sentenced under the Taliban to five years in jail for
eloping with a neighbor when promised by her father to her cousin,
Allah Mohammad.</TE>
<TE>   The man she loves is poor. Sayed Agha, 22, visited her house as a
relative of her mother. He would bring gifts, they would talk alone
for an hour or two, and sometimes steal away outside. They secretly
pledged their love and eloped.</TE>
<TE>   "I love him so much I was willing to go to jail for him," Fariba
said.</TE>
<TE>   The couple spent two years in separate jails. Released when the
Taliban fell, they went to the new authorities in Kabul, expecting to
get permission to be married.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking that this government would be better, but it was
the same or even worse than the Taliban," she said. The earlier
sentence was confirmed, and the pair were returned to jail.</TE>
<TE>   Fariba's father, Allahdad, 56, never criticized her behavior until
she refused to marry her cousin.</TE>
<TE>   But after that, she said, he beat her with a power cord and
threatened to kill her.</TE>
<TE>   She is terrified that her father or one of her five brothers will
kill her when she is freed.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all this, she is firm. "I will never agree to marry my
cousin."</TE>
<TE>   Rana said that even if Fariba and Agha receive court permission to
marry after they serve out their terms, their lives will be at risk.</TE>
<TE>   "All my relatives are waiting at my back," Fariba said. "I hope
the day I am released, none of them will be here."</TE>
<TE>   Dixon was recently on assignment in Afghanistan.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Plans Pakistan Sale, Aid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration is planning its first major military sale to
Pakistan since U.S. sanctions against the country were lifted last
fall for its cooperation in the war against Al Qaeda and the Taliban
in neighboring Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Agency for International Development also outlined plans
Wednesday for an increased aid program intended to improve Pakistani
education and health.</LD>
<LD>   The Defense Department gave Congress the required notification of
the possible sale of six C-130 cargo planes and related equipment and
services valued at up to $75 million.</LD>
<TE>   "This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and
national security of the United States by helping to improve the
security of a friendly country which has been and continues to be an
important force for economic progress in South Asia," the Pentagon's
Defense Security Cooperation Agency said.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan needs the planes to improve airlift capabilities both for
its own air force and as it seeks to support the U.S. campaign in
Afghanistan, the agency said.</TE>
<TE>   Though there have been some small transfers of military spare
parts since the sanctions were lifted, the proposed $75-million deal
is the largest. Some of the sanctions were imposed after Pakistan's
nuclear tests in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   USAID, meanwhile, said it would give Pakistan $50 million in aid
annually and hoped to raise the amount to $80 million by 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the aid is set aside for improving the quality of and
access to health and education services.</TE>

<HD>Appeal Filed for 3 Convicted in Pearl Case</HD>
<DH>Pakistan: Key evidence presented against the men is false,
the defense lawyer says. The ringleader plans his own appeal this
week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Three men sentenced to life in prison for the kidnapping and murder
of U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl launched an appeal Wednesday,
claiming that key evidence against them is false.</LD>
<LD>   Convicted ringleader Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, who was sentenced to
death by hanging, plans to file a separate appeal with the Sindh
province High Court by the end of the week, defense lawyer Rai Bashir
said.</LD>
<LD>   All four convictions "are illegal, against the law and against the
evidence which is on file," Bashir said after filing a six-page
appeal on behalf of Sheikh's accomplices, Salman Saquib, Fahad Naseem
and Sheikh Mohammed Adeel.</LD>
<TE>   Their appeal came a day after prosecutor Raja Qureshi asked the
High Court to increase the penalty from life, which in Pakistan
carries a maximum of 25 years in prison, to death by hanging.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals could go to the nation's Supreme Court and take many
months to exhaust. But Qureshi predicted in an earlier interview that
judges wouldn't allow the process to drag on too long and said the
terrorism convictions would be upheld.</TE>
<TE>   The defense charged that Judge Syed Ali Ashraf Shah, who presided
over the closed trial in a heavily guarded jail courtroom, reached
his verdict under orders from Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf.</TE>
<TE>   "After reading the judgment, I've come to the conclusion it was
not written by the judge but [by] a bureaucrat," Bashir said.</TE>
<TE>   'Sense of Fear'</TE>
<TE>   Shah found all four men guilty of kidnapping and murdering Pearl,
former South Asia bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal, and said
they wanted to create a "sense of fear nationally, [and] insecurity
nationally and internationally."</TE>
<TE>   "The minor discrepancies pointed out in evidence ... did not hit
or touch the root of the case," the judge wrote in his 54-page
verdict Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution called 23 witnesses, including an FBI computer
expert who examined a laptop he said was used to e-mail ransom notes,
which included photos of Pearl in captivity.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh, a British-born Islamic extremist who once confessed to
kidnapping an American and three British tourists in India in 1994,
called only two character witnesses: his father, Saeed Ahmad Sheikh,
who is a wealthy businessman in London, and uncle Rauf Ahmad Sheikh,
a Pakistani judge.</TE>
<TE>   Shah accepted evidence that the ransom notes were transmitted on
Naseem's Internet account and that police found the original,
handwritten messages in Urdu and English at his home.</TE>
<TE>   He also concluded that handwriting expert Ghulam Akbar Jafferi had
proved that Adeel wrote the Urdu ransom notes and that Sheikh penned
the English version.</TE>
<TE>   Saquib was with Naseem when they bought the Polaroid camera and
computer scanner used to create the e-mailed photos of Pearl, the
judge found.</TE>
<TE>   Police are still looking for seven other suspects in the
kidnapping and murder of Pearl, who disappeared Jan. 23.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl was researching a story on Richard C. Reid, a Briton who was
arrested in December after allegedly trying to set off explosives in
his sneakers on an airliner flying from Paris to Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Appeal Faults Judge</TE>
<TE>   In their appeal, Sheikh's accomplices accused the judge of
ignoring any evidence that contradicted the prosecution's case.</TE>
<TE>   The only evidence against Adeel is the alleged ransom note in
Urdu, which "was not corroborated by any other piece of evidence,"
Bashir wrote in the appeal notice. And Jafferi admitted in court that
he had no training in handwriting analysis, the lawyer added.</TE>
<TE>   The only two pieces of evidence against Saquib, alleged
confessions by him and Naseem, were made under police pressure after
a long period in custody and were later retracted, according to the
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   A laptop computer, scanner, computer disk and Urdu and English
ransom notes that police say they found Feb. 11 in Naseem's Karachi
apartment were inadmissible for several reasons, including
discrepancies in serial numbers, Bashir argued.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agent Ronald Joseph testified that the laptop was used Feb.
2-4, "while the prosecution case is that the abductor sent the e-mail
on Jan. 27 and Jan. 30," according to the appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Pakistan's Interior Ministry and the investigating police
officer admitted that Naseem didn't live at the address where police
found the computer equipment and notes, but with his parents, Bashir
wrote.</TE>

<HD>Bus Ambush Victims Mourned</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Funerals are held for five of the eight Israelis
killed in the West Bank attack. Among the dead is a baby delivered by
caesarean section.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Reeling from the second attack on their settlement in seven months,
the devoutly observant Jews in the West Bank enclave of Emmanuel
buried their dead Wednesday, as Israelis grappled with the reality
that not even the army's reoccupation of much of the West Bank has
stopped the terror.</LD>
<LD>   Just hours after funerals were held for five of the eight Jewish
settlers killed Tuesday when Palestinian gunmen attacked a bus
outside the settlement, a double suicide bombing in Tel Aviv
underscored the resurgent threat. A pair of Palestinians blew
themselves up in the seaside Israeli city, killing at least three
other people and wounding about 40.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier in the day, an Israeli lieutenant and a Palestinian gunman
were killed during a running gun battle across the northern West
Bank's rocky slopes and narrow valleys. The army said it suspected
that the militant was a member of the cell that ambushed the bus.
Three Israeli soldiers were injured in the fighting, and a military
spokesman said troops spent the day searching for other members of
the cell.</LD>
<TE>   "After 26 days of quiet, we are back at the starting point,"
mourned the lead editorial Wednesday in the Israeli daily Maariv,
referring to the weeks-long lull in fatal attacks on Israeli
civilians before the bus ambush. "Once again there is terror, and
victorious cheers on the Palestinian side. Once again [Palestinian
Authority President Yasser] Arafat pays lip service in condemning
terror, and once again we bury our dead."</TE>
<TE>   At least 17 Israelis were injured in Emmanuel. All of the dead and
wounded were from the settlement, where a similar attack occurred in
December, killing 11 Emmanuel residents.</TE>
<TE>   The army said Wednesday that it believes that the same cell of the
militant Islamic movement Hamas that carried out the December attack
also ambushed the bus.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the cell's members have been killed or captured since
December, but the leader is believed to be alive and to have
commanded Tuesday's attack, an army spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that the operation which is currently going on will end in
the killing of all of the four terrorists," Israeli Defense Minister
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer told representatives of the Jewish settlements
after visiting the scene of the attack. "We know who they are; we'll
catch them all. We'll also get those who sent them."</TE>
<TE>   Among the dead from the bus assault was a baby boy delivered by
caesarean section after his mother, who was eight months pregnant,
was badly wounded in the pelvis and leg. Doctors initially
resuscitated the infant, who was born without a pulse. But he died
early Wednesday, according to hospital officials. His mother
reportedly remained in serious condition.</TE>
<TE>   Ben-Eliezer said the attack underscored the need for Israeli
forces to stay deployed inside Palestinian cities across the West
Bank. The army seized seven of the eight largest cities last month,
after back-to-back attacks in Jerusalem killed 26 Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   "Our presence inside the cities, considering the warnings we have
[of planned attacks], is a must," Ben-Eliezer said. "This isn't a
political question, it's a question of security par excellence.
There's no possibility to evacuate the cities today."</TE>
<TE>   Although Tuesday's bus attack was widely viewed here as an Israeli
military failure, the army's presence inside Palestinian cities and
across the West Bank has led to the arrest or killing of dozens of
militants and the near-daily thwarting of attacks, army officials
pointed out.</TE>
<TE>   About 800,000 Palestinians have lived under virtual
round-the-clock military curfews for nearly a month, allowed to come
out of their homes only for a few hours every few days to buy
supplies. Israeli intelligence has been able to collect "real-time"
information on the ground, used to apprehend would-be suicide bombers
and their handlers.</TE>
<TE>   Until Tuesday, no Israeli civilians had been killed by
Palestinians since the operation, dubbed Determined Path by the army,
got underway June 20. However, at least 40 Palestinians have been
killed, including 22 who were unarmed, according to B'Tselem, an
Israeli human rights group.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's attack prompted criticism here of the army and the
government and calls for tougher action against the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Most galling for the army was the fact that the cell they believe
attacked the No. 189 bus in December was able to elude capture for
seven months, then brazenly return to the scene, carry out a similar
ambush and escape again.</TE>
<TE>   Sooner or later, wrote military analyst Amos Harel in the Haaretz
daily, "every new chief of staff ... goes through this experience ...
a military failure just as he takes office." Harel noted that
Israel's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Moshe Yaalon, just happened to face
his sooner than usual--a week after his appointment.</TE>
<TE>   Several analysts agreed that the army is stretched too thin in the
West Bank, where it is controlling Palestinian towns, pursuing
militants, thwarting attacks and guarding about 200,000 settlers who
live in hundreds of widely scattered communities.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Naveh, a minister without portfolio in the government of
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, said those who fault the government
should instead blame the Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, there is no one to talk to on the other side, no
one to negotiate with and to reach some sort of solution and calm
with. There's no one on the Palestinian side with whom we can start a
dialogue which would lead to an agreement that he would assume the
responsibility for security and do the work for us."</TE>

<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Britons endured disruptions in services ranging from garbage
collection to libraries, schools and the London Underground on
Wednesday in strikes that underscored the unhappiness of workers with
the government of Prime Minister Tony Blair.</LD>
<LD>   The one-day strike by municipal workers was their first nationwide
walkout since 1979, when a wave of stoppages during the "winter of
discontent" toppled a Labor government and ushered in the Thatcher
era. But despite the inevitable comparisons, Wednesday's strikes had
a limited impact on the average person.</LD>
<LD>   A separate 24-hour strike by workers in the Underground that began
at 8 p.m. Wednesday was likely to be the more disruptive, causing
massive inconvenience for the 3 million commuters who use "the tube"
daily. Workers scurried to complete their homeward commutes by 8
p.m., and traffic chaos was predicted for today.</LD>
<TE>   The strikes came as several big unions affiliated with Blair's
Labor Party slashed their contributions to the party, claiming that
the government had turned its back on its traditional supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Municipal workers were demanding a 6% raise, while local
governments had offered 3%. The unions argued that municipal workers'
salaries lagged behind those of other public-sector workers.
Employers countered that they were offering a generous raise that was
twice the rate of inflation.</TE>
<TE>   The three unions behind the municipal workers strike--the
Transport and General Workers Union, the GMB general workers union
and UNISON -- claimed that 750,000 workers stayed home Wednesday. But
the Employers' Organization for local government gave a lower
estimate. It said 600,000, about half the workers involved in the pay
dispute, took part. It estimated that one-quarter of state schools
closed, while unions claimed that 70% were forced to shut down.</TE>
<TE>   Unions said a classroom assistant earns $18,750 a year and a
school cook about $11,700.</TE>
<TE>   "The issues in the dispute are not just about pay," said Bill
Morris, general secretary of the TGWU. "It's about respect and it's
about dignity in the workplace."</TE>
<TE>   John Edmunds, an official with the GMB, said on British
Broadcasting Corp. radio that many of the lowest-paid workers were
women.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a very big problem of low pay in local government. Over a
quarter of a million people, many of them women, earn less than 5
pounds [$7.80] an hour," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The strike comes days after the Blair government announced plans
to increase spending by the equivalent of $95 billion in the next
three years, mostly on education, housing, defense and crime
fighting. But the government sidestepped the labor dispute Wednesday,
arguing that it was between local governments and their employees. It
said it had provided the local governments with generous funding.</TE>
<TE>   The strike by the Underground workers was expected to bring the
subway to a halt today, although management pledged to run what
services it could.</TE>
<TE>   The Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers union organized the
strike. The RMT, Britain's largest rail union, claimed that
government plans to partially privatize the Underground rail network
would jeopardize safety. Polls conducted by the BBC and the union
indicate that many people fear that safety could be compromised
because serious accidents occurred after the privatization of the
national railways.</TE>
<TE>   For the rail union, the issue is not just about safety. It is also
political.</TE>
<TE>   The RMT last month cut its financial contribution to the Labor
Party from the equivalent of $172,000 to $31,000 because of anger
over the government's refusal to renationalize the railways and plans
to partially privatize the subway. Tens of thousands of union members
also quit the party.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Britain's main postal workers union, the Communication
Workers Union, announced that it would cut funding to the Labor Party
by $780,000 over the next three years because of plans to cut 15,000
employees.</TE>

<HD>Swiss File Papers to Join U.N.</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Switzerland formally applied for membership in the United Nations on
Wednesday, ending its longtime anxiety about joining the world body
and other international organizations.</LD>
<LD>   Emphasizing his country's neutrality, Jeno Staehelin, the Swiss
observer at the world body, handed U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
a thick sheaf of documents and a letter signed by Swiss President
Kaspar Villiger.</LD>
<LD>   No date has been set for the application to be approved by the
15-member Security Council and the 189-member General Assembly, but a
positive vote is a foregone conclusion in both bodies. The tiny
Pacific nation of East Timor, which became independent in May, is
expected to clear the membership procedure by September.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly 55% of voters in Switzerland, which is home of the U.N.'s
European headquarters in Geneva, approved membership in a March
referendum by a margin of about 10 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   The referendum carried 12 of 23 cantons, the Swiss equivalent of
states, with French-speaking areas outvoting the reluctance among
rural German-language regions. The close result underscored the
divisions created by the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Staehelin, in handing over the application, said his government
wished that "Switzerland could join the United Nations as a neutral
country and contribute to the work of the organization as a neutral
country."</TE>
<TE>   In response, Annan said, "We really look forward to working with
Switzerland as a member of the United Nations, and I wish to
congratulate you and your government and the Swiss people for having
taken what I consider a wonderful and wise decision."</TE>
<TE>   Switzerland has participated in U.N. agencies since the 1950s.</TE>

<HD>For CEOs, It's a Lot Lonelier at the Top</HD>
<DH>Scandals: The pay and perks still are lavish, but many
executives bristle at the public's scorn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kathy Bronstein leads a life to envy. As chief executive of Wet Seal
Inc., she rules a chain of 584 clothing stores with 7,000 employees.
Her weekly paycheck exceeds $16,600, more than some Americans earn in
a year. Like most CEOs, she is celebrated, praised, coddled and
obeyed.</LD>
<LD>   Bronstein also is proud of how she's guided Orange County-based
Wet Seal. Yet on a recent vacation to Hawaii, she found herself
reluctant to reveal her occupation.</LD>
<LD>   "I was embarrassed to tell people I was a CEO," she said. "It's
like being a big sinner."</LD>
<TE>   CEOs and other top executives nationwide concede they're under a
spotlight of scorn because of the scandals rocking corporate America.
From small firms to the behemoths of the Fortune 500, senior managers
find themselves targets of outrage from everyone from President Bush
to Main Street investors whose stock portfolios are plunging in
value.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly it's open season on CEOs now," said William Clay Ford
Jr., chairman and chief executive of Ford Motor Co. "But the broad
brush with which everybody is tainted isn't really justified."</TE>
<TE>   With their lavish compensation, CEOs may have a tough time getting
sympathy--particularly from Americans whose jobs or nest eggs have
been destroyed by corporate corruption. But in a series of
interviews, CEOs said the fallout from scandal-ridden firms has
damaged their companies and their reputations--and many feel angry
and insulted.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm infuriated with executives at Enron, Global Crossing,
WorldCom and others who have gone way overboard and hurt us all,"
said Stephen Baum, CEO of Sempra Energy, the parent of Southern
California Gas Co. and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric.</TE>
<TE>   "They've created a huge problem for shareholders and employees
throughout the economy," Baum said. "Stocks like ours have been
trashed. I'd like to wring their necks."</TE>
<TE>   A Question of Trust</TE>
<TE>   Most companies have clean books and ethical employees, and the men
and women in charge say they are distressed that the new distrust of
all things corporate is demolishing the value of companies that many
of them spent years building up.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how we're going to go about restoring trust now that
we've destroyed it," said Lewis Platt, retired CEO of Hewlett-Packard
Co.</TE>
<TE>   Integrity, represented by a female figure high on the neoclassical
facade of the New York Stock Exchange itself, is under assault, and
many CEOs are seething.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an assumption that you are somehow less than upright, an
assumption that you may be cooking the books or doing something
else," said Mitchell Kertzman, CEO of Liberate Technologies, a
supplier of interactive TV software.</TE>
<TE>   And though the job of CEO still is one that many want and few
attain, "the great majority of these people are feeling that their
reputations are being smeared by the Enrons and WorldComs ... and
these CEOs are upset," said Bill Coleman, senior vice president for
compensation at Salary.com, an online site that focuses on executive
pay.</TE>
<TE>   Added Jeffrey Christian, himself CEO of Christian &amp; Timbers, an
executive search firm in Cleveland: "For many CEOs, it's just not as
fun anymore."</TE>
<TE>   It's still not digging ditches, either. Chief executives of major
companies enjoy a rarefied, often lavish lifestyle, with plush
offices, executive jets, limousines, personal assistants and other
perks. A CEO with at least two years' tenure had a median salary and
bonus of more than $1.6 million last year, and that doesn't include
the millions of dollars in stock options many receive, a survey by
Mercer Human Resource Consulting and the Wall Street Journal showed.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, top executives are expected to deal with all sorts of
problems, including economic swings, labor strife, regulatory
changes, lawsuits and, of course, competition.</TE>
<TE>   But with the wave of scandals this year, CEOs must work harder and
find new solutions simply to maintain the credibility they have,
executives said. And they must do so in a business and political
climate that has changed dramatically in just a few months.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a new order, a new world," said Paul Charron, CEO of New
York-based apparel maker Liz Claiborne Inc. "You've got to be squeaky
clean."</TE>
<TE>   Fred Hipp, CEO of the 137-store California Pizza Kitchen chain,
agreed, saying that "if you play the game of being overly aggressive,
it's going to catch up with you."</TE>
<TE>   Reactions to the scandals are forcing CEOs to quickly switch gears
to stem the crisis of confidence, which has sent the stock market
tumbling to its lowest levels in five years. Wall Street wants more
financial disclosure. Congress wants more independent directors on
corporate boards, which hire and fire CEOs. Regulators want CEOs to
certify their companies' financial statements.</TE>
<TE>   And some of the perks may be taken away. The Senate voted last
week to ban corporate loans to executives, which often are made to
help managers relocate or buy company stock.</TE>
<TE>   The Business Roundtable, an association of CEOs, supports many of
those steps. "I'm not sure you can print what I think" about the
scandals, said Edward Rust Jr., the group's vice chairman and CEO of
State Farm Insurance Cos. "Businesses have enough challenges day in
and day out without the totally unacceptable behavior we've seen in
the last six to nine months."</TE>
<TE>   General Electric Co. and Coca-Cola Co., two icons of U.S.
capitalism, have been moved by the scandals to change their way of
doing business. GE was prodded to supply more information about its
quarterly financial results. And Coke said this week that it would
start treating employee stock options as an expense to avoid any
suggestion that its accounting standards aren't tough enough.</TE>
<TE>   "When Enron happened, I thought it was just one company," said
Gary Fayard, chief financial officer of the Atlanta-based soft-drink
giant. "But every time I picked up the paper or watched the news, the
accounting scandals continued. I've just been shocked."</TE>
<TE>   So has Tom Evslin, founder and chief executive of ITXC Corp., a
Princeton, N.J.-based provider of telecommunications services. The
telecom industry and its investors have been especially shaken in
light of the WorldCom and Global Crossing fiascoes, and, Evslin said,
"It's necessary to work harder to get trust.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not fair to the vast majority of CEOs who are honest, and
yet there's been enough abuse so that you can certainly understand
why people feel abused," he said. "They have been."</TE>
<TE>   Even executives of privately held companies, which don't have
stocks traded on public markets, are feeling pressure to be more
forthright. "I just communicate more often" to investors and
employees, said Dan Hesse, CEO of Terabeam Corp., a Seattle-based
maker of telecom equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Fear of Overreaction</TE>
<TE>   But Hesse, who also spent 23 years at giant AT&amp;T Corp., said he
also is afraid that the reforms sweeping through Congress will go too
far, and "we'll get government regulations that will make it very
costly for companies and therefore for the economy." Still, the
scandals are "extremely discouraging, and in fact almost
unbelievable," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Kertzman of Liberate Technologies said "good companies effectively
should get in front of the governance issues" rather than wait for
government action, and that he has "committed to our board ... to
implement and make sure we are organized and are practicing the
highest standards of governance."</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all the upheaval and new challenges, Liz Claiborne's
Charron said he's still proud to be a CEO, as did several others.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an honorable calling," Charron said. "Yes, the dynamics
between boards and CEOs have changed. The world has forever changed.
But my company and I have reputations of doing the right thing, and
as long as we continue to do that, we're going to be just fine."</TE>
<TE>   And despite their frustration, CEOs are trying to keep their sense
of humor. Tuesday, after Continental Airlines Inc. reported a
second-quarter loss of $139 million, CEO Gordon Bethune quipped to
reporters: "Obviously if we were going to cook the books, we should
have come up with better numbers than this."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Marc Ballon, Elizabeth Douglass, Leslie
Earnest, James Flanigan, Jon Healey, Terril Yue Jones, Joseph Menn
and Alex Pham contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Promises of Boroughs Nothing New in L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX and NITA LELYVELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a few short weeks, borough plans were the latest craze in Los
Angeles politics. With the threat of secession bearing down, several
lawmakers latched onto the notion as a way to diffuse power outside
City Hall without breaking up Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   But then the secessionists' citywide poll numbers faltered and a
City Council that preaches the virtues of power-sharing let the idea
die.</LD>
<LD>   So it goes throughout Los Angeles history. When the outlying areas
start grumbling, downtown leaders vow to give them more voice and
power. Then the promises are forgotten or small reforms are
substituted for substantive power-shifting ones, until anger
threatens to erupt once again.</LD>
<TE>   Few people paw through Los Angeles' political past. If they did,
they'd know the borough concept is one of the city's golden oldies.</TE>
<TE>   Boroughs helped make Los Angeles big; the city dangled the promise
of them to persuade San Pedro, Wilmington and the San Fernando Valley
to annex.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since, the city has used the appeal of boroughs to stay big,
raising the prospect virtually every time those same areas have
complained loudly about how they're treated. Los Angeles has tossed
out--and then snatched back--the idea at least six times over the
past century.</TE>
<TE>   The basic idea of boroughs is to increase representation by
propelling power into a city's far-flung neighborhoods. Los Angeles
has grown tremendously, but its City Council hasn't; the 15 members
now represent about 250,000 people apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Boroughs will be back--the city's history all but ensures
that--especially if secessionists come close to winning cityhood in
the Valley or Hollywood on Nov. 5, and the city feels the need to
appease them.</TE>
<TE>   "The history of L.A. is a history of sweeteners," UC San Diego
political scientist Steven P. Erie said. "They're used tactically to
head off discontent."</TE>
<TE>   The city's earliest borough bait dates to 1909, when Los Angeles,
angling to acquire land for a harbor, wooed San Pedro and Wilmington
to join the city by offering local control and money for civic
improvements. Los Angeles voters even approved a charter amendment
allowing for newly acquired areas to form boroughs to "regulate and
control all local municipal affairs."</TE>
<TE>   At first, though, the state Constitution did not provide for
boroughs. A 1911 amendment fixed the problem. But by then, the city
was pouring money into the harbor area, so no one pushed for
autonomy, said James W. Ingram III, a political scientist at San
Diego State University who has written about the history of Los
Angeles charter reform.</TE>
<TE>   The contentment didn't last. In 1917, when Wilmington activists
demanded a borough for their area, the City Council used legal
technicalities to block them, a move backed up by the California
Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of natural inertia to the system; bureaucracy, the
various unions, various council members create real resistance to
change," Ingram said. "So the real changes that would make a
difference in the city mostly get buried. So many radical reform
ideas have come in here, and all have gone the way of the dodo. And
historically, the City Council has been the greatest force to
preserve the status quo."</TE>
<TE>   So it went in 1925, when the city wrote a new charter that
included boroughs, giving them real clout. But the charter allowed
the council to block borough creation.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s and 1970s, secession rumblings in the Valley, harbor
area and Westside prompted another flurry of borough proposals, which
went nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   The council yanked a plan for neighborhood boards out of a
proposed charter (which voters ultimately rejected) in 1970. In 1973,
the city legislative analyst said the original borough provision in
the 1925 charter was obsolete, and voters agreed to remove it.</TE>
<TE>   Boroughs tend to be offered as a lure only in times of pressure,
said Ingram.</TE>
<TE>   "You would never see a push for boroughs if it weren't for
secession. In the past, the city has always blocked them," he said.
"We're talking about way back to stopping the original boroughs in
the harbor."</TE>
<TE>   Just what a borough is anyway depends on who is talking. Over the
years, they've been defined both as mini-governments with broad
powers and as advisory boards informing the city of neighborhood
points of view. Often, conflicting definitions have surfaced in a
single debate.</TE>
<TE>   Though people agree that change is needed, what form that change
should take has long been a sticking point.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, Los Angeles voters approved a new city charter
only after a combative, two-year process involving two separate
charter commissions (the result of a dispute between the mayor and
the council).</TE>
<TE>   Erwin Chemerinsky, the USC law professor who led the elected
charter commission, said his panel thoroughly considered
boroughs--although people called them "elected neighborhood councils
with decision-making authority" instead.</TE>
<TE>   "No issue received more attention from the charter reform
commission than this one," he said. "In the end, though, we rejected
it [because] we never found a good answer to the NIMBY problem. The
concern was that a neighborhood council with decision-making
authority over land use--you can call it a borough if you want--would
never allow the next halfway house or jail or battered-women's
shelter to be built in its area."</TE>
<TE>   So the charter ended up with two weaker innovations: neighborhood
councils with advisory power, and area planning commissions whose
land-use decisions can be overturned by the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   George Kieffer, head of the appointed charter reform commission,
said he thinks that the planning commissions, at least, are beginning
to make real headway and that people would like them if they knew
about them.</TE>
<TE>   "We should have called them borough planning commissions," he said
jokingly.</TE>
<TE>   But Valley secessionists, some of whom had said they supported
charter reform, declared that the new charter did not go far enough.</TE>
<TE>   Playing politics with boroughs isn't just a downtown pastime. Over
the years, secessionists have learned to use the city's reform
efforts to promote their cause.</TE>
<TE>   "The key advocates of secession were never authentically
interested in charter reform," said former City Councilman Mike
Feuer. "Their tactic was to try to obtain as much as possible, only
to deem it insufficient."</TE>
<TE>   In the most recent borough brouhaha, three council members and two
state legislators produced four separate plans to either create a
borough system or study one. But none of them will be on the Nov. 5
ballot. The council even shot down a proposal to study the structure
of local government.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Valley separatists decried the plans as a crass attempt
to derail secession. Then last week, two key secession leaders
huddled in secret with borough backers to talk compromise. When Mayor
James K. Hahn nixed the deal and news of the back-room meetings
leaked out, red-faced secessionists took a new, old tack, denouncing
city officials for "killing reform."</TE>
<TE>   "This city couldn't reform itself if its future depended on it,"
said Richard Katz, the former assemblyman and Valley secession
leader. "Those that have power will never give it up willingly. If we
want boroughs, or any system of government that gives real power to
neighborhoods, that will only come through cityhood."</TE>

<HD>Coalition Faults Networks Over Lack of Diversity</HD>
<DH>Television: Multiethnic group criticizes ABC, CBS, NBC and
Fox, saying they have failed to comply with a 1999 accord. TV
executives say progress has been made.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brandishing "report cards" with several sub-par marks, a multiethnic
coalition pushing for more minority representation on network
television once again blasted the four major broadcast networks
Wednesday for what they called a lack of significant progress in
honoring commitments to increase diversity in their prime-time
lineups.</LD>
<LD>   The networks, however, are striking a more defiant tone than they
have since the issue arose three years ago, giving the coalition
itself low marks for a lack of cohesion among its leaders as well as
what they say is a failure to acknowledge legitimate progress,
weakening the effort's credibility.</LD>
<LD>   "That's the conversation that has been going on in the upper ranks
of network offices--that this group is losing steam," said one senior
network executive, on condition of anonymity. "You look at the raw
data from 1999 to today, and there have been significant strides
made. But all we have gotten from the coalition is a backhand."</LD>
<TE>   Several network executives said that leaders of the coalition have
diminished its impact by concentrating on individual agendas for
their respective ethnic advocacy group rather than working together
toward a common goal. They also cited the relative low profile of the
group's most influential member, NAACP Chairman Kweisi Mfume, as a
major factor behind the coalition's deteriorating clout.</TE>
<TE>   "The coalition is not a unified front," said another TV executive,
criticizing the group for failing to recognize the strides that have
been made.</TE>
<TE>   Mfume was not present at a news conference Wednesday, at which
coalition leaders handed out their annual report card on how well
ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox were doing in honoring a 1999 agreement to
increase diversity. That pledge followed a season in which none of
the 26 new shows on the four major stations featured a minority lead.</TE>
<TE>   Although NAACP spokesman John White appeared with other coalition
leaders, the civil rights organization did not issue grades with the
other groups. White said the NAACP would issue its separate report on
television diversity later this month.</TE>
<TE>   Issuing grades were the Asian Pacific American Media Coalition,
the National Latino Media Council and American Indians in Film &amp;
Television.</TE>
<TE>   CBS landed at the bottom overall with a D-minus, a drop from the
D-plus the network received last year. NBC, which received the
highest grade last year with a C, dropped to a D-plus.</TE>
<TE>   ABC, which scored the lowest last season with a D-minus, improved
to a C-minus. Fox, which received a C-minus last season, came out on
top with a C.</TE>
<TE>   Saying they are now being pushed to take action against CBS,
coalition leaders said they are writing letters to eight of the
network's top advertisers and the board of its parent company,
Viacom.</TE>
<TE>   The NAACP, however, is not signing the letter. Said White: "We
would have given CBS a different grade. It probably would be higher.
We feel they have made some progress."</TE>
<TE>   The coalition had particularly harsh words for CBS President
Leslie Moonves. Said coalition leader Karen Narasaki: "Les Moonves
was never that interested in significantly increasing opportunities
for Latinos, Asian Americans and Native Americans. Now he appears to
have lost interest altogether."</TE>
<TE>   Josie Thomas, CBS' senior vice president in charge of diversity,
said she did not understand the coalition's grade, adding that there
has been a significant increase in minority casting at CBS and that
several minority creative executives had been hired. CBS also
scheduled a drama with a predominantly black cast, "City of Angels,"
though the show was canceled because of low ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "Les Moonves has been out in front of this issue from the very
beginning," Thomas said. "This is extremely important to him."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, CBS said that it has been "in the vanguard in its
support for diversity. This biased and distorted attack on the
company represents the personal agenda of one segment of the
coalition and that of its leader." Spokesmen for the other major
networks also maintain that they are making important progress on the
diversity front.</TE>

<HD>Accrediting Commission Warns College</HD>
<DH>Education: State panel says Ventura campus' annual report
lacked information on school's improvements and contained sections
that were identical to its 1998 document.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV and AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura College received a warning last month from a California
accrediting commission for submitting a report that did not include
up-to-date information on its hiring improvements.</LD>
<LD>   College President Larry Calderon also was notified in a June 19
letter from the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior
Colleges that some portions of his school's 2002 report were
identical to those in its 1998 report.</LD>
<LD>   Although the 25,000-student college showed improvements in hiring
practices and other areas, those changes were not contained in the
latest report submitted in March, the Santa Rosa-based commission
stated.</LD>
<TE>   The college's executive vice president, Joan Smith, said the
report was submitted by her predecessor and she did not know why he
excluded information or why he recycled old material.</TE>
<TE>   Calderon was not available Wednesday for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "Many sections appeared to be copied directly from the college's
1998 Midterm Report, giving the commission little information about
what progress may have been made since 1998," the warning letter
stated.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who assumed her post last month, said she is working with
faculty, administrators and the Academic Senate president on next
year's report, which will be submitted in April, when an
accreditation team visits all three campuses in the Ventura County
Community College District.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very, very confident this will not be an issue," Smith said.
"The commission said we made improvements; it just wasn't reflected
in the report. But it will be done and we will be off the warning."</TE>
<TE>   A warning is the least serious action administered by the
commission, which accredits colleges every six years.</TE>
<TE>   All campuses in the state community college system are required to
be accredited, which means they have been self-evaluated and
independently scrutinized by a team of experts on all aspects of
campus life, including student services, instruction, finances and
governance.</TE>
<TE>   An accreditation team presents recommendations to improve the
school. Those improvements are usually outlined in a report submitted
by the campus president.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the view of the commission and the visiting team that the
college did not take seriously its responsibility to the commission
for thoughtful and thorough response to the previous
recommendations," the letter stated, "nor did the report present
accurately a description of college programs and services as required
by commission standards."</TE>
<TE>   The commission made 10 recommendations in 1998, including that the
college should conduct a comprehensive review of its hiring
procedures to ensure the highest quality and diversity among faculty,
classified staff and administrators.</TE>
<TE>   Such procedures and policies are already in place across the
district, Smith said, but they were not included in the latest
progress report.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what they were trying to say is the district is doing its
job, and the commission wants to see it in writing," she said.</TE>

<HD>Veteran Officer Killed in Freak Firearm Accident</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: He was crossing the San Fernando police station
parking lot when he dropped his gun and it fired. An investigation is
underway.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A San Fernando police officer was killed Wednesday when he
accidentally dropped his service pistol and it discharged, the bullet
striking him in the head, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Jesse Kenneth Paderez, 46, of Sylmar, a 10-year veteran of the San
Fernando Police Department, had apparently been carrying his
holstered .45-caliber gun in his hands as he walked through the
department parking lot early Wednesday, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Paderez had stopped at the station about 6:45 a.m. to pick up a
patrol car and was scheduled to attend a training class on radar use
later that morning, Lt. Mike Langston said.</LD>
<TE>   "The gun was secured in the holster but he was carrying it in his
hands, most likely along with other items," Langston said. "The
hammer of the gun struck the ground when it dropped and discharged.
We believe it was a freak accident."</TE>
<TE>   Langston said police are investigating how the firearm discharged
and whether safety mechanisms worked properly.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Anthony Alba said an investigation by Los Angeles County
sheriff's detectives resulted in a preliminary determination that the
death was accidental.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something that shouldn't happen but could happen," said
Alba, who took over the 39-officer department in May. "But it all
hurts the same."</TE>
<TE>   Paderez was the third officer in the department's 91-year history
to die in the line of duty, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Paderez had seven sisters and five brothers. Officers and a sister
described him as a dedicated officer who was an avid runner and
relished coaching and mentoring young people.</TE>
<TE>   "He was highly dedicated to children and working with them meant a
lot to him" said Jeri Arriaga, a sister and a retired Los Angeles
County sheriff's deputy. "It's like losing half of your heart."</TE>
<TE>   Arriaga said several family members have entered law enforcement.
One brother, Ernesto, worked for the Los Angeles Police Department
but died 11 years ago in a traffic accident, Arriaga and Langston
said.</TE>
<TE>   At the San Fernando Police Station, the mood was somber. Officer
Al Martinez said he was stunned by his friend's death.</TE>
<TE>   "He was always very cautious," Martinez said.</TE>

<HD>A Vote Against Drilling Off Coast</HD>
<DH>Congress: In a rebuff of Bush administration, House
approves cutoff of federal funds used to support new oil wells off
California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a bid to call attention to what they say is unequal treatment by
the White House, members of California's congressional delegation won
a bipartisan House vote Wednesday to cut off federal money needed to
permit new oil drilling off the state's coast.</LD>
<LD>   The amendment to an Interior Department spending bill passed 252
to 172, with the support of 67 Republicans.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters of the amendment, including 42 of California's 52 House
members, said they hoped the vote would nudge the White House to buy
out leases off California's Central Coast--as President Bush agreed
to do last month for controversial offshore leases in Florida, where
his brother Jeb is running for reelection as governor.</LD>
<TE>   "This vote puts Congress on record against new drilling off
California's coast," said Rep. Lois Capps (D-Santa Barbara), who
sponsored the amendment with Reps. George Miller (D-Martinez) and
Nick J. Rahall II (D-W.Va.). Capps called its passage "a major step
toward terminating the leases that threaten the central coast's
environment and economy."</TE>
<TE>   The half-hour debate on the amendment was charged with accusations
of favoritism on Bush's part.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem we have here is we just haven't been able to find any
of his relatives in California," said Rep. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.). "I
hope if you're a Bush relative in California--I don't care if it's a
second cousin, third time removed--call the White House and ask him
to take care of California."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's effort to curtail administrative funding earmarked for
helping oil companies act on outstanding drilling leases in federal
waters off the California coast mimicked tactics used in the past by
other states.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a similar vote on drilling off the coast of Florida was
used by that state's delegation to help fuel their fight to keep
their coast pristine. That vote passed 247 to 184, with the support
of 70 Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   But opponents called the amendment on California's leases
meaningless because activity on new sites off the state's Central
Coast had already been suspended last year by a federal judge, a
decision now on appeal. Furthermore, they argued that continuing to
lock up regions of the country against new oil exploration was the
wrong answer</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot reduce the amount of energy production that our country
has today without dramatically impacting our freedom," said Rep. Zach
Wamp (R-Tenn.). "We'd better not tie our hands behind our back with
this amendment and others like it."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) spoke against the
amendment, saying it amounted to helping "some very wealthy people
concerned about their view."</TE>
<TE>   Rohrabacher, who told his colleagues he is an avid surfer and
scuba diver who spends every weekend in the ocean, said he believes a
move away from offshore drilling platforms would mean more oil
tankers and greater risk for the coastline. "It's trendy to be
against offshore drilling," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is it that we've got people in this body who will vote
against any type of energy development when it comes to oil or
natural gas? Why is that, when they realize we have people overseas
at this moment risking their lives because our country is dependent
on potentially hostile powers for our oil?" Rohrabacher said.</TE>
<TE>   "My California colleagues and I have been fighting [against
offshore drilling] for many years," said Rep. Lynn C. Woolsey
(D-Petaluma), one of several California Democrats to speak for
cutting off funding. "It is not a fad."</TE>
<TE>   Nine California Republicans--Rohrabacher, John T. Doolittle
(Rocklin), Wally Herger (Marysville), Howard P. "Buck" McKeon (Santa
Clarita), Gary G. Miller (Diamond Bar), Richard W. Pombo (Tracy),
George P. Radanovich (Mariposa), Ed Royce (Fullerton) and William M.
Thomas (Bakersfield)--voted against the amendment. Democrat Tom
Lantos (San Mateo) did not vote.</TE>
<TE>   The fate of 36 offshore leases--some of which are next to Channel
Islands National Park--has become a hot issue in the gubernatorial
race between Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, and Republican businessman
Bill Simon Jr. Davis' request to Interior Secretary Gale Norton to
buy out California's leases--as the department did for Florida--was
rejected last month.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter, Norton cited ongoing oil production off California's
coast as evidence that "Florida opposes coastal drilling and
California does not."</TE>
<TE>   But Simon--who has come out strongly against new offshore
drilling--emerged from a White House meeting last month saying he had
Bush administration support to sit down and talk about ridding the
California coast of oil rigs.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Doors were locked. Not a single kid splashed in the pool. And the
lush, green courtyards of the Smoketree condominium complex--usually
buzzing with children--were empty Wednesday morning.</LD>
<LD>   Until a few days ago, parents paid no mind as their children ran
down the sidewalks and up the alleys with friends in this quiet
enclave of about 100 condominiums in Stanton.</LD>
<LD>   Then 5-year-old Samantha Runnion was dragged screaming into a car,
killed and left by the road in the Cleveland National Forest, sending
this small community into shock.</LD>
<TE>   Parents in Smoketree are struggling to find ways to cope. They
agonize over choosing the right words to share with their children
and wonder whether they can ever let them out of sight again.</TE>
<TE>   It's a dilemma facing many parents in Southern California and
beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say parents must tread a careful line between scaring
their children and leaving them unprepared for danger. Tell children
not to talk to strangers and what to do if approached, counselors
advise, but don't give them the sense the world is an unsafe place.</TE>
<TE>   "Children will pick up on fears," said Ginger Wilson, a
psychologist with the American Red Cross of Orange County. "You've
got to be careful not to spook them."</TE>
<TE>   She advises adults to talk out their fears with friends,
counselors or spiritual leaders. Adults should reassure their
children about how they are safe with family, friends and teachers,
Wilson said, and remind them who they can trust if they ever feel in
danger.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere are parents more bedeviled by these questions than at the
Stanton condominium complex where Samantha lived.</TE>
<TE>   Lydia Petrey, 44, who was never before uncomfortable about
allowing her 7-year-old son to play in front of her condo said one of
her biggest concerns is that she doesn't know many of her neighbors,
which makes it hard to keep tabs on activity in the complex--who
belongs there and who doesn't. She hopes to change that.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to get together more and take some responsibility for
keeping our eyes open and looking out for each other," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Even some Red Cross workers who live nowhere near Smoketree were
too traumatized by Samantha's killing to come and help with
counseling on Wednesday, Wilson said. She called the slaying the
hardest thing she has had to deal with personally or professionally
since counseling the families of victims of the World Trade Center
attacks as they identified body parts.</TE>
<TE>   "These kinds of events change your perceptions forever," she said.
"You think, 'My home isn't safe; the courtyard isn't safe. What if he
comes back? What if he is here right now and we don't know it?' "</TE>
<TE>   There is already talk of installing an electronic gate to wall off
the condo complex. Parents don't let their children outside alone,
and residents have stopped waving hello to people they don't know.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not only distrustful of people I don't know--now, it's even
some people I know," said Monica Klingporn as she and her three
children brought flowers to a memorial set up for Samantha.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people are still in shock," said Sandy Hill, a counselor
with Trauma Intervention Programs of Mission Viejo. She advised
parents to prepare for unpredictable reactions from their children as
they talk about what is going on. "Kids don't know how to express
what they are feeling and what their fears are," she said. "Children
are going to need to talk about whatever they need to talk about."</TE>
<TE>   Hill and other volunteers carry teddy bears around Smoketree to
give to children as part of counseling. They walk by signs that say
"Samantha" in green and blue letters posted on shade trees in the
courtyards. One sign has notes scribbled on it from other children.
"I miss you," one note says.</TE>
<TE>   Healing is just beginning, experts say. It will be a long process,
and the wounds will be reopened by media updates on the hunt for a
suspect and any trial, among other triggers. The vulnerability,
depression and outrage may linger for years.</TE>
<TE>   "People need to channel their fear into enhanced awareness of
themselves, their families and their neighborhood," said Wilson of
the Red Cross.</TE>
<TE>   Residents are trying to do that.</TE>
<TE>   "I've gone from nervousness and fear to anger," said neighbor
Patrick Douglass. "But ultimately, this will bring us closer
together."</TE>

<HD>FERC Raises Energy Price Caps</HD>
<DH>Power: Limit jumps to $250 per megawatt-hour under plan.
Panel moves to cut Davis' authority over state electricity grid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR and NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal regulators Wednesday more than doubled the top price at which
energy generators can sell electricity in California and moved to
sharply reduce Gov. Gray Davis' authority over the state's power
grid.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, however, they voted to create a
computer-controlled system designed to block attempts to manipulate
power prices.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said their
actions, taken together, would curb price spikes and thwart market
manipulation while laying the groundwork for increased power
supplies.</LD>
<TE>   "This is an attempt, as surgically as we can, to make sure that
market power [abuses] are in fact squelched," said FERC Chairman
Patrick H. Wood III. He said the new system would allow prices to
rise in genuine shortages, while stopping abusive price manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, however, immediately criticized the FERC actions, as did
consumer activists.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, FERC views its constituency as energy generators, not
consumers," said the governor. "FERC has acted with lightning speed
to benefit energy generators, but we've yet to see a penny for
California consumers."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers'
Action Network in San Diego, predicted that California consumers
would pay more under the new rules. "This emboldens generators to
overreach," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) called the new price limits a
"workable solution" that "should prevent what happened in 2000 from
happening again." Feinstein added, however, that she would have
preferred FERC to leave existing price caps in place.</TE>
<TE>   And California's staunchest ally on FERC's governing board urged
state officials not to rush to judgment. "I would ask of those in
California who might be concerned ... to take a close look at the
[new system] and the protections from the exercise of market power it
affords," said William Massey, a Democrat who last year led the drive
for price controls.</TE>
<TE>   The key FERC ruling would replace the current electricity price
cap of $91.87 per megawatt-hour with a higher limit of $250.</TE>
<TE>   Generators that offer power for more than $91.87 would have their
bids scrutinized by a computer program, and the bids would be
automatically reduced if indicators of potential abuse are detected.</TE>
<TE>   Peak power prices in California are now in the range of $40 per
megawatt-hour.</TE>
<TE>   FERC's governing board said its two unanimous rulings were
intended to chart a course for the state that would eventually revive
deregulated electricity markets under tight, independent supervision.</TE>
<TE>   California's electricity markets have changed greatly since last
year. Now, nearly 90% of the state's power needs are met through
long-term, fixed-price contracts. The FERC ruling affects the
remaining power purchases needed to balance the electric grid and
keep the lights on from day to day.</TE>
<TE>   The new price-limitation system is based on a model recommended by
experts in California and already used in New York. It is designed to
replace a temporary price limit on wholesale electricity enacted in
the midst of last summer's crisis. That temporary limit is set to
expire Sept. 30.</TE>
<TE>   FERC officials said the new system, scheduled to take effect Oct.
1, is designed to stabilize prices for California consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Wood said the new $250 price limit was not a signal to encourage
generators to charge more, but a "safety net" in case of problems
with the computer-based monitoring system.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the country, such upper limits on bids are set at
$1,000 per megawatt-hour. California consumers should not face more
price spikes, he said.</TE>
<TE>   By and large, FERC approved a package of market rules proposed by
CAL-ISO, the independent system operator that operates the state's
power grid.</TE>
<TE>   The price-limitation scheme is designed to eliminate the need for
protracted litigation over refunds by limiting the amount that an
energy generator can bid for power. California is currently embroiled
in a case before FERC, seeking $9 billion in refunds for alleged
overcharges.</TE>
<TE>   The computer-driven system looks for two main indicators of
possible abuse: prices far in excess of previous bids submitted from
each generating plant, and bids that could drive up the overall
market price by $50 or more. If the program detects indications of
abuse, the bid is automatically reduced to a predetermined level
based on the plant's cost of production.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer groups remained highly skeptical. Doug Heller, of the
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica, called
the new price-control regime "utterly senseless."</TE>
<TE>   "Despite all the talk about restraining out-of-control
corporations, the Bush administration is turning the power system
over to the Enrons and others who stole billions from California," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the current price limits, the new system will continue
indefinitely, with no expiration date. The FERC ruling also contained
measures geared to prevent generators from withholding supply. It
also called for a conference to address a continued shortfall in
California's production of energy.</TE>
<TE>   FERC's second ruling Wednesday dealt with the politically charged
issue of who controls the ISO.</TE>
<TE>   The commission determined that the current board, composed of five
Davis appointees, was not independent, and therefore is in violation
of basic organizing principles for such entities.</TE>
<TE>   Davis controls both the board that oversees the transmission
system and one of that system's largest clients, the state Department
of Water Resources, which is purchasing power for cash-strapped
utilities.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only does the ISO have to be independent in reality, but it
must be independent in perception," said FERC Commissioner Massey.
"In my view, as presently constituted, the California ISO fails both
tests."</TE>
<TE>   FERC ordered that the present board be replaced by a new board
chosen in consultation with a range of parties involved in California
energy policy, including generators, utilities, consumer groups and
state officials. It set a deadline of January 2003 for revamping the
board.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute over control could lead to a pitched battle between
FERC and the Davis administration.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we may have the state police and the federal marshals
both showing up at the first board meeting in 2003, figuring out who
gets to sit and who doesn't," said Mike Florio, a senior attorney
with the Utility Reform Network and one of Davis' appointees to the
ISO board.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see how we can legally surrender our authority until we
have an appellate court decision," he added. "FERC is going out on a
legal limb, saying that their authority allows them to change the
governing board."</TE>
<TE>   When California launched its deregulated electricity market in
April 1998, the ISO was overseen by a 26-member board structured
along the lines that FERC is now calling for. After wholesale prices
began to soar, the board debated acrimoniously for days over whether
to impose price caps.</TE>
<TE>   Davis accused the board of being dominated by private power-plant
owners, and in January 2001 he signed a bill that created a new board
composed of his appointees. Since then, "we've been in a showdown
[with FERC]," said ISO Chairman Michael Kahn.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Doug Ose (R-Sacramento), a leading critic of Davis, welcomed
the FERC ruling. "When Gov. Davis controls the marketplace and
simultaneously controls the largest market participant, it sends a
chilling signal that the state will put Gov. Davis' political fate
before that of the consumers and suppliers," Ose said.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under fire from a Latino civil rights group, Ventura County
Supervisor John Flynn issued an apology Wednesday for comments he
made during a well-publicized flap with the wife of Oxnard's mayor.</LD>
<LD>   The League of United Latin American Citizens on Tuesday asked the
U.S. Department of Justice to mediate a dispute between Flynn and
Irma Lopez that in recent weeks has escalated to include other
influential members of Oxnard's political community.</LD>
<LD>   The dispute stems from Flynn yelling "I'm gonna get you!" to Lopez
as she left a Democratic picnic in June.</LD>
<TE>   In subsequent news accounts, Flynn accused Lopez and other Latino
leaders of attempting to oust him from office and replacing him with
a Latino politician, saying Lopez "won't be happy until she sees a
sea of brown faces in every political office in west Ventura County."</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference Wednesday, Flynn said he was sorry he made
Lopez believe he was threatening her. Flynn said he was only trying
to defend himself against perceived attacks on his reputation. He
also apologized for the "brown faces" comment that has inflamed some
in the local Latino community.</TE>
<TE>   "I used these words to support the idea that everyone regardless
of race, color ethnicity or religion should have the opportunity to
win an elective office," he said. "I probably could have used a
different set of words to express the idea."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez was out of town and unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn earlier proposed a "peace summit" with Latino leaders in
Oxnard, but said that idea didn't appear to have much support. He
issued the apology in an effort to resolve the matter faster, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Denis O'Leary of the Latino league's local chapter, said while he
appreciated Flynn's apology, he believes a mediation session with the
Justice Department is still necessary. Attempts to reach Justice
officials were unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   "Supervisor Flynn has done a great job for the Latino community,"
O'Leary said. "Unfortunately, his relationships with many community
leaders have not been appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Flynn, at the news conference, said he would prefer a summit
organized by the Ventura Center for Dispute Settlement. He also said
he does not know whether he would participate in a meeting organized
by the Latino league.</TE>

<HD>2 Policemen Indicted in Boy's Beating</HD>
<DH>Courts: Grand jury charges one Inglewood officer with
assault under color of authority and the other with filing a false
report. They likely will surrender today.</DH>

<LD>The Los Angeles County Grand Jury indicted two Inglewood police
officers Wednesday on felony charges in the videotaped beating of a
16-year-old boy who was handcuffed, then slammed onto the trunk of a
patrol car and punched in the face, according to officials and others
close to the case.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Jeremy Morse, who can be seen on the videotape striking
the boy, was charged with assault under the color of authority;
Officer Bijan Darvish, his partner, was charged with filing a false
police report, sources said. The indictment will be unsealed today,
they added, and the officers are expected to surrender and be
arraigned in court.</LD>
<LD>   County prosecutors took the case to the grand jury within days of
the videotape's first airing July 7. They finished presenting
testimony late Wednesday morning, and the grand jurors handed up the
indictments about 3:30 p.m. to Supervising Criminal Judge Dan Oki,
sources said.</LD>
<TE>   Attorneys for both Darvish and Morse were contacted Wednesday
afternoon and told that their clients must appear in court at 11 a.m.
today or arrest warrants will be executed. Morse's attorney, John
Barnett, said Wednesday afternoon that he had not seen the indictment
but will be in court with his client today.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett added that he would review the indictment and might ask
for the arraignment to be postponed. Ultimately, he said, his client
will plead not guilty. "We are confident that an unbiased jury will
determine that he used an appropriate level of force, and he is not
guilty of any crime," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's vote by the grand jury concluded a six-day inquiry
into the Inglewood case. The grand jury heard testimony from 11
witnesses, sources said. They included beaten youth Donovan Jackson
and his father, Coby Chavis; the two county sheriff's deputies
involved, Carlos Lopez and Daniel Leon; as well as other Inglewood
police officers. Morse did not testify.</TE>
<TE>   Criminal grand jury proceedings are conducted secretly, with only
the jurors, prosecutors and a court reporter present. By obtaining
grand jury indictments, prosecutors avoid a preliminary hearing, a
proceeding at which witnesses can be cross-examined by the defense.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, Morse and Darvish each could face up to three years
in state prison. The bail for both officers will probably be set at
$25,000.</TE>
<TE>   The incident, which occurred July 6, began when the two sheriff's
deputies approached Chavis at an Inglewood gas station to investigate
expired registration tags on his car, according to accounts provided
by the Sheriff's Department, Inglewood police and others.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson came out of the station market and ignored orders by one
of the deputies, the Sheriff's Department report said. Patrolling
Inglewood police arrived to assist, and a struggle ensued. Jackson
was struck in the face twice by Darvish before being handcuffed,
according to the Inglewood police report.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of the boy have said he is developmentally disabled and
does not fully process commands.</TE>
<TE>   When the videotape of the incident begins, Jackson is lying on the
pavement, already in handcuffs. At that point, Morse, who is white,
lifts Jackson, who is black, off the ground and slams him into the
police car. Morse is then seen punching the boy in the face--a
response, he said in the police report and to others, to Jackson
grabbing his testicles.</TE>
<TE>   The treatment of the boy attracted nationwide attention, drawing
comparisons to the 1991 beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police
officers. That case went to trial in state court, and after the
officers involved were acquitted, Los Angeles was plunged into riots
that ended with dozens dead and more than $1 billion in property
damage.</TE>
<TE>   In the Inglewood case, U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft sent his top
civil rights lawyer to Southern California last week to investigate;
the FBI has indicated that it would look into the beating, and both
the Inglewood police and the Sheriff's Department are conducting
internal investigations. A federal civil rights lawsuit was filed
last week on behalf of the boy and his father.</TE>
<TE>   While those investigations moved forward, Morse was placed on paid
administrative leave; the other officers remain at work but have been
assigned to desk duty. The two sheriff's deputies are still at work,
and department officials have said they do not believe they engaged
in any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood City Administrator Joseph T. Rouzan Jr. said that the
Police Department's internal affairs investigation is nearly complete
and that he expects to decide whether to fire or discipline the
officers within 14 days.</TE>
<TE>   "We've just about completed the interviews of everyone except Mr.
Morse," he said Wednesday. "Sometime next week I'll have the chief's
recommendation.</TE>
<TE>   "If you go by information you have here, you have a very serious
offense that requires very serious consideration based on what is
known," said the former Inglewood and Compton police chief of the
taped incident.</TE>
<TE>   Rouzan said there are few if any circumstances that justify an
officer striking a suspect in custody. In Inglewood, the maximum
suspension for an officer is 30 days; any offense more serious than
that results in dismissal.</TE>
<TE>   An indictment will not affect the decision on the officers' fate,
Rouzan said.</TE>
<TE>   One issue that prosecutors and others have raised is the accuracy
and thoroughness of the official reports describing the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Darvish, who wrote the Inglewood incident report, said he and
Morse arrived at the gas station as backup when they saw Jackson
lunge at one of the deputies. Darvish wrote that Jackson said, "I'm
not getting in the car! I'm not getting in the car!" The officer also
wrote that he and Morse saw Jackson hit the deputy, so they grabbed
his arms and pulled him to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson struggled and flipped over on his back and began
scratching and pulling on Morse, the report said, adding that the boy
then grabbed at Darvish. The officer wrote that Jackson ignored
commands to stop grabbing his uniform, so he struck the youth twice
in the face. He said other officers then helped subdue Jackson, who
was placed in handcuffs.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, an unemployed disc jockey, Mitchell Crooks, began
videotaping the encounter. Crooks was arrested last week on
outstanding warrants by district attorney's investigators who were
seeking to obtain the videotape for the grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   The tape shows a limp Jackson being lifted by his pants and thrown
onto the patrol car. The police report does not describe the manner
in which the boy was placed on the trunk of the car. It says that
officers "assisted Jackson to his feet and had him stand facing the
police vehicle."</TE>
<TE>   As Jackson was splayed across the trunk of the car with his hands
behind his back, his head moved. It was then that Morse punched him
in the face, a moment captured on video and described in the report
as well. In the report, Darvish said Jackson had grabbed Morse's
testicles. The video does not make clear whether that occurred.</TE>
<TE>   On the tape, another Inglewood officer, Mariano Salcedo, appears
to come between the boy and Morse. They separate, and Jackson is then
led to a patrol car.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's investigators interviewed both Chavis and Jackson, and
neither indicated that they were hurt by the deputies, sources said.
However, Chavis' attorney, Milton Grimes, said his client told the
grand jury that a deputy choked Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Morse, who has three years' experience with the Inglewood Police
Department, has had several other complaints made against him. But he
was described by some in the department as a dedicated officer,
firmly committed to his job.</TE>
<TE>   In other developments Wednesday, state Assembly Speaker Herb
Wesson (D-Culver City) announced the creation of a commission that
will examine police departments' use of force in light of the
Inglewood incident.</TE>
<TE>   The new Speaker's Commission on Police Conduct, which will examine
use-of-force issues in the hope of improving safety and protecting
the civil rights of the arrested, is scheduled to meet for the first
time Friday in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>FBI Says Slain Girl's Abductor Sent Message: 'Come Find Me'</HD>
<DH>Crime: The killer of a Stanton 5-year-old posed the body in
a way to indicate he would strike again, investigators say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY and GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The killer of 5-year-old Samantha Runnion posed her nude body in a
mountainous ravine as a "calling card," according to investigators
who described the assailant Wednesday as a sexual predator who could
strike again soon.</LD>
<LD>   "We feel he was challenging us," said Richard T. Garcia, head of
the FBI's criminal division in Los Angeles, confirming that a child's
body found late Tuesday in plain view near Lake Elsinore was
Samantha's.</LD>
<LD>   The girl was grabbed from outside her Stanton condominium in
northern Orange County on Monday evening, and authorities believe the
kidnapper spent several hours with Samantha, sexually assaulting and
eventually asphyxiating her sometime Tuesday. Officials suggested the
girl fought back, scratching her attacker's face and arms.</LD>
<TE>   Detectives said they've gathered physical evidence from around
where Samantha's body was found, including DNA samples and tire
tracks. Using this evidence and assumptions FBI agents gathered from
other cases, investigators developed a detailed profile of the
killer. They urged the public to be on the lookout for anyone who
matches a broad set of characteristics, from drinking excessively to
being unusually moody.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities asked the public to report anyone who suffered bruises
or scratches, missed worked Monday or Tuesday, paid unusual attention
to media coverage of the case or recently changed hairstyles.</TE>
<TE>   Although profiling has produced a mixed record in past cases,
officials asked people to call police even if there is a seemingly
plausible explanation for the behavior. The warnings sparked alarm
among some parents, who said they were watching their children with
extra vigilance and, in some cases, forbidding them from playing
outside without adult supervision until a suspect is arrested.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm overwhelmed and scared," said Stanton mother Lydia Petrey,
44. "It doesn't take long. I can be watching [my son], turn around
for a moment, and then he could be gone."</TE>
<TE>   While detectives believe they understand the killer's motivation,
they have no specific suspects.</TE>
<TE>   The profile is based in part on the way Samantha's body was posed,
though officials would not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   "The killer knows the position of the body, so we don't want to
make that public. It was posed to indicate this person would do it
again," Garcia said. He added the killer was sending a message: "Here
I am, come find me."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities promised they will.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't sleep, don't eat, because we're coming after you," Sheriff
Michael Carona warned the killer at a news conference outside
Samantha's home during which his voice cracked with emotion.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement agencies received thousands of calls from the
public offering tips. The suspect is described as an "Americanized
Hispanic" male with slicked-back black hair and a mustache who was
driving a green car, possibly a Honda or Acura. Officers have pulled
over many cars matching the description since Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody knows this guy," FBI spokesman Matthew McLaughlin said.
"And because he was driving a car when this kidnapping took place, it
stands to reason he had to work somewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "So if not people at work, then people who may know him as friends
need to contact us."</TE>
<TE>   Samantha and a friend, Sarah, were playing about 150 feet from the
Runnion home Monday when the kidnapping occurred. The friend said a
man drove up after making a U-turn, got out and asked whether they
had seen his "little chihuahua." He then grabbed Samantha and carried
the girl back to his car as she fought back.</TE>
<TE>   Criminal behavior analysts developed a checklist of so-called
"artifacts" that could identify the man from injuries on his hands,
arms or face, to changes in work habits or sleeping patterns. The FBI
said it doesn't believe the suspect has killed before, but its
profilers have painted a portrait of a man with a history of
kidnapping and sexually assaulting children.</TE>
<TE>   "This may be the first time it ended in death. That's what leaves
us to believe he may do it again," Garcia said. "The person has a
short fuse."</TE>
<TE>   Because of that, the public was asked to report any recent
attempted kidnappings or assaults.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to hear from parents if they or their children have been
approached," Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials acknowledged that their unusually direct public pleas
were alarming but said the evidence warranted it.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a time to let your kids out of your sight," Carona
said. "That doesn't mean you need to keep them in the house."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, as a memorial grew by Samantha's doorstep, the only
children around were those being interviewed by reporters --and they
were being closely watched by parents.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to be the same around here for a long time for a
lot of people, especially her friends," said Joey Garcia, 11, who put
up signs with Samantha's name on trees throughout the complex.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha's mother, Erin Runnion, who pleaded on television for her
daughter's return after the kidnapping, was in seclusion Wednesday
but sent an e-mail to friends thanking them for their support.
Sheriff's deputies were stationed outside the house of Samantha's
playmate, the only known witness to the abduction.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I'm scared," said Zia Ezzat, an 8-year-old friend of
Samantha. "If I play around here or out on the street, someone might
come up to me and ask the same question as they asked Samantha."</TE>
<TE>   The case is the latest in a series of disappearances of young
girls in recent months nationwide, including the abduction and
killing of 7-year-old Danielle van Dam from her San Diego area home.
Danielle's mother said Wednesday she had spoken to Erin Runnion.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a conversation--mother to mother--about our daughters, our
pain and also our hope that Danielle and Samantha are dancing
together in heaven," Brenda van Dam said in a statement. "These
outrageous crimes being committed against our young, innocent
children must be severely punished."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information is asked to call the Orange County
Sheriff's Department at (714) 890-4280.</TE>

<HD>A Final Dip in the Pool</HD>
<DH>Facility: Mission Viejo reopens 30-year-old Sierra
Recreation Center for last season of fun and games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>mckibben/willon/dunn / jw</AU>
<BD>.....</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The local outcry to save Mission Viejo's Sierra Recreation Center
convinced the City Council to grant a summertime reprieve for the
aging public pool, but that has failed to persuade many swimmers to
take the plunge.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the heat Wednesday, only a few residents bothered to cool
off in the 25-meter, eight-lane pool. However, those who dropped by
for a swim were happy the facility was still open, even with its
cracks and rust-stained deck.</LD>
<LD>   "Thank God it's reopened," said Judy Findley, who moved to Mission
Viejo seven years ago from Torrance. "I've been coming here since the
day we moved here.</LD>
<TE>   "The city has really done some neat things for its residents with
the mall, the lake and the new library and City Hall. Keeping this
place open would be another nice thing they could do."</TE>
<TE>   City officials said refurbishing the 30-year-old center would not
be cost-effective, especially since Mission Viejo plans to spend $1
million next year to renovate and expand Montanoso Recreation Center,
which is a mile from Sierra and offers swimming and workout
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an emotional issue," City Manager Dan Joseph said. "I don't
think you'll ever appease those who have enjoyed having their summer
swimming pool close to their home. But you can't have pools a mile
from everybody's home. And at what expense and at whose expense do we
do that?</TE>
<TE>   "There's 100,000 people in this community. I'd venture to say a
lot of those people would say, 'Those are my tax dollars too and
there are a lot of other things we could use my tax dollars for.' "</TE>
<TE>   The council voted 4-1 in May to close the Sierra center and
upgrade Montanoso. In the last five years, the once-bustling Sierra
sports center was open only during the summer. Last August, city
officials said the pool averaged 22 swimmers a day. Joseph said it
would cost the city $1 million to refurbish the pool, deck and the
activities building</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the city sent out a survey to residents asking what to
do with Sierra. The respondents voted to fill in the pool and build a
children's park.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Sierra proponents organized the Save Our Sierra group
to spare the pool.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters spoke out at a July 1 council meeting, saying the
sports center was one of the amenities that attracted them to Mission
Viejo. In response, the council voted to keep Sierra open through
Oct. 31, and instructed staff to meet with residents about possibly
forming an association to purchase and operate the center.</TE>
<TE>   Since the pool was reopened Monday after being closed for nine
months, swimmers have begun to trickle in. On Monday and Tuesday,
Sierra's staff reported daily attendance of 87 and 66. Wednesday at
noon, the staff outnumbered the swimmers, 3 to 2.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin McCalley, 29, who drove from San Clemente to swim a few
laps, nearly had the pool all to himself. "This is one of the pools I
learned to swim in," he said. "I love it here. I heard it was open
again and I came up to support it."</TE>

<HD>Profiling Not Always Model of Accuracy</HD>
<DH>Forensics: Instant analysis of a serial killer in O.C. case
may be pushing limits of an inexact science and causing undue alarm,
experts say.</DH>

<LD>Someone had splashed cold water in the face of a carefree town. It
was 1990, and five students had been murdered in Gainesville, Fla.
Stumped investigators turned to criminal behavior
analysts--detectives who specialize in developing a psychological
"profile" of a potential criminal suspect's mind.</LD>
<LD>   The ensuing profile was so general, though, that it only muddied
the case. Angry detectives demanded answers: Where did the killer
live? What kind of car did he drive? The answers, they were told,
were not available. It took months--and luck--to arrest Daniel
Rolling.</LD>
<LD>   Nine years later, three women were murdered near Yosemite National
Park, and police sought a profile. This time, the FBI brought back
specifics: The women were killed by drug-dealing bikers from Modesto.
They were wrong. Police eventually arrested Cary Stayner, a local
handyman--but not before he killed again, investigators believe.</LD>
<TE>   Wednesday's disclosure by authorities that they believe a serial
killer is on the loose marked another day in the periodically
brilliant, often-clunky and ever-imprecise development of
psychological profiling.</TE>
<TE>   Profiling is a natural contradiction. Its masters claim to
understand the minds of strangers--often irrational killers. It is a
soft, inexact science in a field that demands specifics.</TE>
<TE>   And in the case of the murder of 5-year-old Samantha Runnion, many
law enforcement officers and criminologists say, Orange County may
have pushed the limits.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Sheriff Michael Carona on Wednesday said the girl
had been sexually assaulted and that the fact her body was not
meticulously hidden indicates that the killer wanted it found and may
be challenging police.</TE>
<TE>   Those claims, said former and current law enforcement agents,
either mean that Orange County officials know more than they are
telling the public or that they are leaping to conclusions and
presenting them as fact to a terrified public.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't buy it," said Robert Ressler, former supervisor at the
FBI's behavioral science unit at Quantico, Va. "There is no way they
can come to these sorts of conclusions."</TE>
<TE>   This sort of rapid profiling, based on an eyewitness account from
the girl's 5-year-old playmate and a quick review of the evidence,
"is about as accurate as infomercials about dieting techniques," said
James Alan Fox, professor of criminal justice at Northeastern
University.</TE>
<TE>   "Profiling, when done right, is not a cram job. They may have
overreached. And it does tend to instill and inspire a tremendous
amount of hysteria," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Carona insisted he did not intend to frighten parents.
Nonetheless, said Fox, the message, even if unintended, is, "Lock up
your children."</TE>
<TE>   Officials stood by their conclusions. "This is an extreme case,"
said Richard T. Garcia, head of the FBI's criminal division in Los
Angeles. "Because of that, it is very important for us to move
quickly.... The concern is that this person will strike again. And
soon."</TE>
<TE>   The use of profiling to capture a suspect in a child abduction is
further clouded by the lack of knowledge about the prevalence of a
crime that historically has not been included in the federal
government's Uniform Crime Report. Local agencies have only
sporadically kept data.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of child abductions, an estimated
three-quarters, are committed by relatives or acquaintances--many
because of custody battles, according to a 2000 U.S. Department of
Justice report.</TE>
<TE>   An academic team commissioned by the government concluded in 1990
that strangers abduct between 3,200 and 4,600 children each year. The
vast majority of those children are held for a short time, then
released unharmed, according to the study, which is the most recent
definitive research on the subject, said Ben Ermini, a director of
the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and a former
police captain in Yonkers, N.Y..</TE>
<TE>   A small subset of that group, between 200 and 300 children each
year, are the so-called "stereotypical" child abductions--victims of
strangers who pluck them from their families with no intention of
returning them, Ermini said.</TE>
<TE>   All kidnappings, whether by strangers or in custody cases, taken
together constitute only one-tenth of 1% of crimes committed against
children, officials note. Kidnappings by strangers who intend to harm
make up as little as 4% of that total.</TE>
<TE>   "For every child abducted and killed this way, there are tens of
thousands of children who are sexually abused by fathers, stepfathers
and men who have some reason to be around the children. Yet this kind
of crime, of course, frightens the community because it is so
horrible and publicized and irreversible," said Park Dietz, a noted
forensic psychiatrist.</TE>
<TE>   While the cases are rare, investigators have been able to develop
a profile of the stranger-abductor, Ermini said. Typically, they are
single, white men, older than 25, who live alone or with their
parents. They are child molesters with criminal records and they were
likely abused as children themselves, he said.</TE>
<TE>   That's historically as far as profilers have gone. In this case,
they have gone further.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the body was discovered, FBI profilers had called from
Washington to offer help. Based on media reports alone, the agents
called in with thoughts about who the kidnapper might be. And shortly
after the discovery of the body, using photos of the girl and the
crime scene e-mailed from Los Angeles, the analysts concluded the
killer could strike again, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Under that premise, the FBI developed a list of "artifacts"--clues
that could help identify the killer. From the possibility of
scratches on the killer's arms to changes in work habits or sleeping
patterns, the FBI created a composite they hope will spark tips from
the public.</TE>
<TE>   But such composites are not always accurate--and there lies the
danger of relying too heavily, too quickly, on profiling to solve a
crime, experts and law enforcement officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Yosemite case, FBI officials expressed confidence for
months after the first homicides in the profile that targeted a biker
gang from Modesto. What's more, they said that the suspects in the
slayings of the tourists had all been captured.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in July 1999, Joie Armstrong was beheaded in the park by
Stayner, according to his confession. This time, Stayner left behind
evidence, and he was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   "There were plenty of reasons to go with the original theory that
it was the bikers," said an FBI agent, speaking on condition of
anonymity. Stayner, for example, planted the wallet of one victim in
Modesto, apparently to mislead investigators.</TE>
<TE>   "You might as well sit down with a Ouija board," the agent said.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers fear Orange County could alarm the public by
placing too much faith in an inexact science.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like it's a bit sensational at this point," said
Gainesville Police Capt. Sadie Darnell, a 24-year department veteran
who was a public information officer during the investigation of the
serial killings there in 1990. "I can see where that could be
alarming to the community as a whole."</TE>
<TE>   But what if they're right?</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1980s, a man had killed 17 prostitutes in the
Rochester, N.Y., area. Police were stumped--until a profiler
predicted the killer would go back and visit the bodies of his
victims. That's exactly what Arthur Shawcross did. He was standing on
a bridge, looking down at a body, when he was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, it is not tried and true," said former Chicago Police
Department profiler Tom Cronin, now police chief in Coeur d'Alene,
Idaho. "But human nature is not tried and true. If it were, we all
would need only one psychologist to fix us all up."</TE>

<HD>Simon Campaigns in L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. toured some of Los
Angeles' neediest neighborhoods Wednesday with former Housing and
Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, promising to spur investment
in the inner city through tax credits.</LD>
<LD>   But Simon's message was interrupted by persistent questions about
his finances, as protesters organized by the Democratic Party
shadowed him throughout the afternoon, waving signs that said "Tax
Evader" and chanting "What is Simon hiding?"</LD>
<LD>   The multimillionaire businessman, who has refused to release his
tax returns, has come under increasing scrutiny in recent days since
the Internal Revenue Service listed him as the beneficiary of a
possibly illegal tax shelter set up by KPMG, one of the world's
biggest accounting firms.</LD>
<TE>   Simon, who has not been accused of any wrongdoing by the IRS, has
repeatedly said that he has complied with California's disclosure
rules and insisted that tax returns are a private matter between an
individual and the government.</TE>
<TE>   But the issue continues to dog him on the campaign trail. On
Wednesday, as he boarded a bus in downtown Los Angeles to take a tour
of several affordable housing projects--walking in the shadow of the
KPMG office building--he had to squeeze by a dozen protesters,
including one dressed as a 1040 tax form.</TE>
<TE>   "Disclosure!" they shouted. "We want disclosure!"</TE>
<TE>   "I have disclosed," Simon said, smiling as he clambered onto the
bus.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he will not change his mind about releasing his
returns, adding that Californians are not interested in his financial
arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll tell you what they want to talk about," he said. "It's not
tax returns; it's jobs. It's not tax returns; it's schools, it's the
quality of life. It's their roads, their water and their power.</TE>
<TE>   "If [Gov.] Gray Davis wants to switch the subject because his
track record is very poor in those areas, I guess I don't blame him,"
he added.</TE>
<TE>   Aides to Davis said people have a right to know how Simon has
spent and invested the money he has made.</TE>
<TE>   "When you run for office, you're asking people to trust you,"
Davis spokesman Gabriel Sanchez said. "In return, you have to trust
them to make an informed decision about you based on your record,
whether it be as a businessman or elected official."</TE>
<TE>   Simon spent the afternoon visiting projects in Pico Union and East
Los Angeles on a tour organized by the Greenlining Institute, a San
Francisco-based advocacy group for economic development in poor
communities.</TE>
<TE>   At La Villa Mariposa in Pico Union, a 115-unit complex for single
women and their children, Simon and his wife, Cindy, tiptoed around
children napping on cots in the spacious day-care center.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't this great?" he said, gently patting some of the sleeping
children. One boy woke up with a start and stared at him in
confusion.</TE>
<TE>   The $15-million nonprofit project, built on land purchased by the
Community Redevelopment Agency, was financed by the Bank of America
and other investors.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a progressive idea," Kemp said. "This can be done in
other communities."</TE>
<TE>   Simon said government needs to provide more incentives through tax
credits for businesses to invest in similar projects.</TE>
<TE>   During a news conference with Kemp, the candidate repeated his
call to cut the capital gains tax to 5% and said he would designate
urban empowerment zones in needy areas where the capital gains tax
would be eliminated entirely.</TE>
<TE>   "The state must focus on and foster public and private
partnerships within local communities, and eliminate high taxes and
crushing regulations which have caused good jobs and businesses to
leave our state in droves," he said.</TE>
<TE>   John Gamboa, executive director of the Greenlining Institute, said
he would like to see the state government play a broader role in
promoting investment in low-income areas by requiring insurance
companies and investment houses to make the same kind of community
development loans that banks currently do.</TE>
<TE>   "The missing link has been the government," Gamboa said.</TE>
<TE>   But Simon said he favors a different approach.</TE>
<TE>   "What we need to do is have people voluntarily come in here with
their capital," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As he left for the next stop on the tour, Simon was greeted by the
same gaggle of protesters.</TE>
<TE>   "Disclosure, disclosure, what's it all about?" they chanted.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh boy," the candidate said under his breath, smiling firmly as
he walked past them.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The nicked wooden stairway leading up to the old cascade head
works in Sylmar vibrates with every step Gerald Gewe takes. Gaining
the roof of the open-faced shed enclosing the site, he lowers his 6
feet, 7 inches through a small square opening.</TE>
<TE>   Down inside, the big man lays hands on one of two large, cast-iron
turn wheels and looks out at the vista.</TE>
<TE>   Before him, the San Fernando Valley is suffused in dusty sunlight
all the way to the horizon. Nearby, the Golden State Freeway streams
with traffic. Just below, the concrete spillway of the historic
cascade curves left down the mountain.</TE>
<TE>   From the freeway, the old cascade seems little more than a
concrete oddment halfway up a dry hill. Yet it is the site where Los
Angeles and the Valley were ceremoniously betrothed, a place of new
historical resonance now that the two entities are contemplating
divorce.</TE>
<TE>   Here, at 1:15 p.m. on Nov. 5, 1913, after various potentates
speechified and Ellen Beach Yaw sang her song, L.A. water czar
William Mulholland gave a signal. Workmen turned the cast-iron
wheels, and Los Angeles Aqueduct water flowed down the cascade and
into the thirsty Valley for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   The unleashed snowmelt from the distant Eastern Sierra made the
union of rural Valley and burgeoning city inevitable. Taking no
chances, the L.A. City Council decreed eight days later that any
outlying areas wanting the water must annex. When the Valley, most of
it, formally came to the altar in 1915, it did so by popular vote,
but under this duress all the same.</TE>
<TE>   The perceived high-handedness of mainland L.A. has been irritating
Valley residents ever since, and as a result on this Nov. 5--89 years
to the day after the head works' gates first opened--city voters will
decide whether or not to dissolve the nuptials.</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Gewe (pronounced GAY-vee) is 58 and has worked for the L.A.
Department of Water and Power for 27 years. Now the DWP's assistant
general manager for water, two decades ago he was in charge of
aqueduct operations. It's "the most fun job I ever had."</TE>
<TE>   In that capacity he once got to raise the head works gates
himself, turning one of the cast-iron wheels with his own hands, just
like those long-departed workmen who responded to the signal from
Mulholland, a figure of reverence to history-conscious DWP engineers
like Gewe.</TE>
<TE>   As a city employee, Gewe won't offer an opinion on the charged
issue of secession. As an engineer, however, he's confident that the
water system Mulholland spawned will endure intact no matter if or
how the city of L.A. is sundered. "Given the complexity of the
system, it would be so expensive to totally separate it that it's not
in the cards," he said. "In spite of the politics, the underlying
infrastructure was designed to operate as one system."</TE>
<TE>   Eighty-nine years ago, the water that tumbled down the cascade,
binding Valley to city, was considered inexhaustible, a delusion
dispelled scarcely a decade later as the city's population went about
quadrupling during a persistent dry spell.</TE>
<TE>   The betrothal site has changed a great deal over time. In 1922,
the DWP built an 8-foot-diameter pipeline that parallels the old
cascade down the mountain. Ordinarily, it bears the burden of the
water, which comes from the Owens River and three streams that feed
Mono Lake in the Eastern Sierra.</TE>
<TE>   The water comes at the behest of gravity through 338 miles of open
channel and sealed pipeline. It traverses 158 tunnels, the last one
of which terminates at the old cascade head works.</TE>
<TE>   At full flow, the water fills the final length of pipeline to the
brim and barrels down into the Valley at 450 cubic feet a second to
turn the turbines at the San Fernando power plant. The old cascade
reenacts its historic role only when the water is diverted to it from
the pipeline during maintenance shut-downs at the power plant.</TE>
<TE>   Just to the east of the old cascade, a newer and much longer
cascade and pipeline rise up and over Terminal Hill. These are the
last leg of the second L.A. Aqueduct, which was completed in 1970 to
handle an augmented supply of water from the Mono basin. Water in
this pipeline drives turbines at the nearby Foothill power plant.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, during the most recent fiscal year the
approximately 211 square miles of the would-be new Valley city
consumed enough water to cover itself to a depth of about 25 inches.</TE>
<TE>   About half of that came from the aqueduct, and half from the
Valley's other source, the State Water Project, which brings water in
from Northern California. The split in supply is the result of DWP
operational decisions; if necessary, the aqueduct is still capable of
serving all of the Valley's water needs in years of at least normal
rainfall.</TE>
<TE>   In this fitfully dry region, any tampering with the arrangements
that bring water is bound to create visceral anxiety. Yet, if the
current battle over secession has made anything clear, it's that
L.A.'s days of water-bullying the Valley are long since over. The
state commission refereeing the secession matter has ruled that
residents of a Valley city would continue to receive the water
they're accustomed to, and at the same rates paid by users in the
downsized city of Los Angeles (City Hall continues to maintain that
it has the right to raise rates for any water client, if there is
reasonable justification for doing so).</TE>
<TE>   After 89 years of city-Valley wedlock, the "waters pure" that
first flowed down the old cascade into Ellen Beach Yaw's "land of
love," have come to look like what a divorce lawyer might call
community property.</TE>

<HD>Is Success in the Wings for Restored Landmark?</HD>
<DH>Some call Steve Needleman nuts for his $3-million
restoration of a Broadway movie palace downtown. But he's confident
of its future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From the stage of the Orpheum Theater, you can see the full splendor
of one of Los Angeles' oldest movie palaces, restored at a cost of $3
million. The original 1926 ceiling gleams in copper and gold leaf.
Towering pilasters and scalloped cornices create a feeling of height
and grandeur above cascading wall boxes and 2,000 wine-colored seats.</LD>
<LD>   You can stand where Judy Garland and Nat King Cole heard cheers
during the waning years of vaudeville--and gaze up, just as they did,
at the 12-foot chandeliers that fill the balcony with electric
candlelight. Looking carefully, you can also see a flaw: The blue
glasswork that rims each chandelier is darker in one than in the
other--a fact that Steve Needleman finds fascinating.</LD>
<LD>   "Back in the '40s," he said, "high school students were running
this place, because all the professional technicians were off at
war." Someone failed to properly brake the elevating mechanism, and
one of the fixtures came crashing down.</LD>
<TE>   "You can actually see a little bend in the railing up there where
the chandelier hit," he pointed out. "It's one of the stories."</TE>
<TE>   Having invested his own money in the risky refurbishment--on
Broadway, in downtown L.A.'s long-dormant old entertainment
district--Needleman was willing to let a few imperfections slip by.
He even seems delighted by the character they give the landmark,
touches of yesteryear nearly concealed beneath the gloss of white
marble, loud rugs and baroque statues.</TE>
<TE>   He walked past a series of paneled doors, each impeccably
finished, and stopped at the last door of the last aisle. This one
alone was worn and discolored by decades of hands, and faintly
scratched with names.</TE>
<TE>   "The graffiti that's etched into the wood, that's almost a
statement of what [the theater] was during the '50s and '60s," the
48-year-old owner said. "Some I've taken out, but I've left a few of
those in places. As silly as it may be, that's part of what it is."</TE>
<TE>   Needleman's restoration of the Orpheum, completed last year, is
seen as a flicker of hope for what was once one of the great theater
districts. In the 1930s, this stretch of Broadway was comparable with
that other Broadway in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "With an unprecedented 12 major theaters," the Los Angeles
Conservancy notes in one historical placard, "the famed ... [Los
Angeles] district contained the highest concentration of movie
palaces in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Those grande dames still exist between 2nd Street and Olympic
Boulevard. The Million Dollar Theater, the Los Angeles Theater, the
Globe, the Palace, the Roxie, the Tower and others form an impressive
variety of facades in styles from beaux-arts to Art Deco.</TE>
<TE>   No longer, though, is Broadway a destination point for wealthy
travelers who once came west by train. Lower-income families, mainly
Latino, flock to the street for discount shopping and fast food. The
historic theaters are used for church services, bazaars, movie
filming and weddings. A few are little more than humongous storage
closets.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news is: They haven't been demolished for a parking lot
or for a high-rise," said Linda Dishman, executive director of the
conservancy. "I'm actually thrilled they're there--they're intact."</TE>
<TE>   The conservancy has taken interest in Broadway almost since the
nonprofit preservation group was founded 24 years ago. One of the
earliest walking tours featured the theaters. A summer film series
was begun 16 years ago to give people the chance to see a movie in
places like the Orpheum, State and Los Angeles theaters. In 1997, the
conservancy created a campaign known as the Broadway Initiative,
aimed at transforming the district into something like Old Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   For all those efforts, Needleman has been the first theater owner
to carry out a complete restoration. He took over the building from
his late father, Jack, who bought it in 1964 and accumulated a number
of properties throughout the garment district.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve is very much the hero in this whole thing," said Dishman,
who presented him with the conservancy's 2002 Preservation Award
earlier this year. "He did a fabulous job."</TE>
<TE>   Needleman concedes that there are skeptics. "Everyone looks at me
like I'm some kind of a nut," he said, "because this is all privately
done. There's not a dime of public money." And it's a gamble. "I
could sit here with an empty building," he said. "[But] I don't think
that's going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   It might be unrealistic to imagine that the theater will ever
again show vaudeville acts or first-run movies--its two primary
purposes when eminent architect G. Albert Lansburgh designed it to
span those eras. At the time Needleman decided to remodel it, the
Orpheum was showing movies with Spanish subtitles--and struggling. It
was in such disrepair that he had to install all new seats, plumbing,
wiring and seismic retrofitting.</TE>
<TE>   When Needleman reopened the building last July--and the rooftop
scaffold sign was lighted for the first time in 60 years--the theater
was being touted for premieres, film and television production,
concerts and private events. Portions of "Austin Powers in
Goldmember" were shot there, as were episodes of "The West Wing" and
"Ally McBeal." Jackson Browne played to a full house in one of the
first public uses of the restoration last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Film premieres are tough to attract downtown, so the public may
still find few chances to attend events at the Orpheum. But earlier
this month 2,000 people turned out--including Hugh Hefner and an
entourage of Playboy bunnies--for the final night of "Last Remaining
Seats," the conservancy's six-part summer film series. The line
reached all the way down the block. The Harold Lloyd silent film
"Girl Shy" was shown with the accompaniment of the theater's original
white Wurlitzer.</TE>
<TE>   Bob DeSpain, 75, drove up from Rancho Palos Verdes and sat in the
balcony, not far from where the falling chandelier once landed. He
smiled and said, "The last time I was in this theater was in 1948-49.
There were street cars then."</TE>
<TE>   He harbored a regret, however. For years, Broadway was filled with
the most magnificent movie palaces he could ever imagine--and he
ignored them. He thought a theater was just a theater.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I know better," DeSpain said, waiting for the curtain to
rise. "It kind of makes me mad. I wish the rest of them would open
up."</TE>

<HD>College District Expected to Name Interim Leader Today</HD>
<DH>Chancellor: Officials say the job was offered to a former
president of the Moorpark campus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV and AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Moorpark College President James Walker, who earned a
reputation for diplomacy with faculty union leaders, is expected to
be named today as acting chancellor of the troubled Ventura County
Community College District.</LD>
<LD>   The district's five-member board of trustees must appoint a
temporary replacement for Chancellor Philip Westin, placed on paid
administrative leave while the district investigates allegations he
misspent thousands of taxpayer dollars.</LD>
<LD>   Several district officials confirmed Wednesday that Walker, 66,
was offered the post and has accepted. Walker could not be reached
for comment.</LD>
<TE>   Walker retired July 1 after a decade at the helm of Moorpark
College. He served as interim district chancellor following the death
of Chancellor Thomas Lakin in late 1994. He served until Westin was
hired in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Miller, president of the Ventura County Federation of
College Teachers, said Walker's appointment would promote goodwill
between trustees and a faculty union distrustful of the current
administration.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't have an ego that requires feeding on an hourly basis,"
Miller said. "He would make an excellent chancellor and would treat
everyone fairly."</TE>
<TE>   Community activist David Maron said placing Westin on leave and
appointing a popular interim chancellor were positive steps but not
enough. "The community is holding its breath and waiting to see what
the board does," Maron said. "The community believes that putting him
on administrative leave is just the first step toward getting rid of
him, but we need to know that the board is not going to cower."</TE>
<TE>   Westin could not be reached for comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   If the board asks Westin to resign, his contract allows him to
collect 18 months' salary, or $305,000. Termination of the
chancellor's contract would have to come with Westin's consent,
unless the board could show cause, according to the college
district's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   To show cause, the board would have to prove one of the following:
that Westin violated his contract; failed to perform his duties
competently; had a physical or mental disability that prevented him
from performing his job; that he habitually neglected his duties; had
engaged in willful misconduct, or was convicted of a felony or any
crime involving moral turpitude.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks Westin has acknowledged poor judgment concerning
some of his expenditures and imposed voluntary limits on meals, but
has repeatedly denied breaking any laws or knowingly violating
district policy. He has stated repeatedly he would not resign.</TE>
<TE>   Trustees planned to announce an acting chancellor at the
conclusion of a private meeting scheduled for this morning. They are
expected to begin the process of selecting an independent counsel and
an auditor to guide them through weeks of research that could help
determine Westin's fate.</TE>
<TE>   In coming weeks, trustees said, Westin will not be permitted to
enter his office. Meanwhile, investigators will have access to
Westin's files and computer equipment and are expected to interview
district employees, from administrators to secretaries to technology
experts.</TE>
<TE>   Westin has been under fire since March, when the Camarillo law
firm of Wood &amp; Bender presented trustees with a report detailing
$119,000 in expenses the chancellor charged the district between 1997
and 2001 for meals, travel, car maintenance, computer software and
other expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Trustees initially sought Westin's resignation. They changed
course after an auditor hired by the district said the expenses
appeared permissible.</TE>
<TE>   Westin alleged that one of the law firm's partners, David Bender,
had prepared the report in retaliation because Westin would not steer
lucrative legal work his way. Bender has denied the allegation.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the board of trustees voted 4 to 1 in May to renew
Westin's contract through 2006 and grant him a $30,000 raise,
bringing his salary to $203,000. Trustee John Tallman cast the only
dissenting vote.</TE>

<HD>Sewage to Be Fully Treated</HD>
<DH>Environment: Sanitation district, persuaded by clean-beach
arguments, agrees to drop its waiver.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA and JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By one vote, the Orange County Sanitation District late Wednesday
opted to abandon a federal waiver that allows it to release into the
ocean dirtier sewage than nearly all of the nation's 16,000 other
sewer agencies.</LD>
<LD>   In doing so, the district agreed to comply with the requirements
of the federal Clean Water Act.</LD>
<LD>   "By us developing a policy of full secondary [standard of
treatment], there's no need for a waiver," said Brian Brady, a
representative of the Irvine Ranch Water District, who made the
motion not to seek another waiver. He said the sanitation district
will have to negotiate with federal regulators, "but I have full
confidence that [sanitation district staff] can do that."</LD>
<TE>   County Supervisor Tom Wilson, who opposed seeking another waiver,
said that "as long as we're going in the right direction with the
right speed, those agencies will applaud us for what we're doing, not
penalize us."</TE>
<TE>   An overflow crowd of more than 200 people listened to the
speakers' comments during the nearly four-hour meeting. They packed
the boardroom, another nearby room and spilled out onto the lawn.
When the vote was announced, the spectators cheered.</TE>
<TE>   The sanitation district is the largest of 36 agencies nationwide
holding a five-year waiver to the federal Clean Water Act. That
waiver expires next June. Canceling the waiver will bring a higher
level of treatment, although it will take about 11 years and about
$400 million to get there, district officials say. That would mean an
average cost increase of $16 annually for homeowners and a major
increase for large businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The price tag does not sit well with Julie Puentes of the Orange
County Business Council. "It will not be acceptable for rate payers
to bear the cost ... only to find that the [beach pollution] problem
continues," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But other speakers countered that the cost will be minimal
compared to the economic gain of cleaning up the area's beaches.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is [that] the end user is going to have to pay a
little bit more," said Ken Kramer, president of the California State
Lifeguards Assn. "Let me have the honor of being the first," he said
as he handed an official a $16 check.</TE>
<TE>   The Clean Water Act requires two levels of treatment to kill most
bacteria and viruses before sewage is discharged into oceans, rivers
and lakes. Since 1977, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has
been allowed to grant waivers to this requirement in cases where it
would not harm the environment or public health. In California, state
water regulators must also sign off on the five-year waiver.</TE>
<TE>   The district, which serves more than 2.7 million residents and
businesses in central and northern Orange County, discharges 243
million gallons of moderately treated sewage into the ocean
daily--enough to fill the Rose Bowl three times. The waiver means
that only half of that sewage receives two levels of treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Directors spent much of the hearing describing the reasons for
their positions on the waiver.</TE>
<TE>   Beth Krom, who represents Irvine on the board, said that "the
health of our ocean is inextricably linked to the health of our
economy and the health of our community."</TE>
<TE>   Placentia representative Norm Eckenrode countered that he believed
there are more pressing matters facing the district. "I would rather
see this board move to urban runoff, which is where the true problem"
lies, he said. "I'm going to personally guarantee ... once the ...
lever is pulled, there will still be beach closures."</TE>
<TE>   Abandoning the waiver seemed to have greater support on the board
until sanitation district lawyers warned that while the new treatment
facility is being built, the agency would be liable for at least
$3,000 in fines a day because it would not have a waiver in place.
Some board members railed against the staff for raising this issue at
the last minute, but in the end, the board voted 13 to 12 not to seek
extension of the waiver.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, these waivers were approved with little fanfare or
public notice. Orange County's waiver was of little concern to
residents until three years ago, when a rash of mysterious closures
and warnings along Huntington Beach's shoreline stumped scientists
and led to millions of dollars in studies on whether the partially
treated sewage was responsible for the beach pollution.</TE>
<TE>   The studies proved inconclusive and sometimes contradictory--one
said the plume was not coming to shore while another concluded that
underwater waves could sweep the sewage from where it's discharged
more than four miles offshore back onto Surf City's coastline.</TE>
<TE>   But as more people learned that 243 million gallons of moderately
treated sewage was being piped offshore daily, the waiver became a
lightning rod for officials.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a group of activists began pushing city, county and
state officials to back efforts to kill the waiver. By this summer,
the loose-knit Ocean Outfall Group had persuaded Seal Beach,
Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, Irvine, Costa Mesa, Orange County
and several other cities and agencies to formally oppose the waiver.</TE>
<TE>   Said Ocean Outfall member Doug Korthof: "There is no compromise."</TE>
<TE>   The group's work drew the attention and resources of national
environmental groups, including the Surfrider Foundation, the Sierra
Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher J. Evans, executive director of the Surfrider
Foundation, said that "what happened today is a victory for
generations in Orange County and marine life and the economy. What we
saw today was courage by politicians."</TE>

<HD>The Bin Laden Guessing Game</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: An FBI official says he thinks the Al Qaeda
leader is gone. But evidence is scarce.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The FBI's top counter-terrorism official spoke out Wednesday about
the fate of Osama bin Laden, saying he believes the nation's
most-wanted terrorist is dead.</LD>
<LD>   The remarks by Executive Assistant FBI Director Dale Watson fueled
the growing debate over the threat posed by Bin Laden, after weeks of
contradictory speculation here and abroad by authorities involved in
the hunt for the elusive leader of the Al Qaeda network.</LD>
<LD>   ''Is [Bin Laden] alive or is he dead? I am not really sure of the
answer.... I personally think he is probably not with us anymore, but
I have no evidence to support that,'' Watson told federal law
enforcement officials at a conference sponsored by the Justice
Department.</LD>
<TE>   Watson's comments, which came in response to a question, are
believed to be the first public remarks on the Al Qaeda leader's
status by a senior U.S. law enforcement official. Watson heads all
counter-terrorism and counterintelligence operations for the FBI. His
remarks strongly suggest that the U.S. government's global
counter-terrorism dragnet has uncovered no information--through
intelligence intercepts and debriefings of captured Al Qaeda
operatives--that Bin Laden survived the massive bombing attacks on
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   One U.S. intelligence official confirmed that there have been no
intercepts or other information indicating that Bin Laden is alive.</TE>
<TE>   But that official and other U.S. counter-terrorism authorities
said they have interpreted the lack of information about Bin Laden's
fate in exactly the opposite manner as Watson.</TE>
<TE>   What is potentially far more telling, the intelligence official
said, is that nothing has been picked up in the international
''chatter'' to indicate that Bin Laden is dead, either.</TE>
<TE>   ''Is it possible that Bin Laden is dead? Yes, it's possible,''
said the intelligence official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ''But is there evidence pointing in that direction? No. He
could certainly be alive.''</TE>
<TE>   ''The bottom line,'' the official added, ''is that we simply don't
know.''</TE>
<TE>   Watson did not explain why he believed Bin Laden is dead. However,
even before Bin Laden came under attack by coalition forces, he had
suffered for years from kidney disease, which authorities believe
worsened as the terrorist leader was forced to flee his Afghanistan
stronghold.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials on Wednesday also cited the last video footage of
him, released in November. They now believe the footage shows that
Bin Laden, who appeared extremely gaunt, had lost the use of his left
shoulder, perhaps from an airstrike-related injury that went
untreated.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Justice Department officials said Watson's remarks caught
them by surprise, and that the department and the FBI officially
remain neutral about whether Bin Laden is alive.</TE>
<TE>   Several U.S. officials acknowledged that the ''is he dead or isn't
he'' speculation of the past few weeks is about as conclusive as
reading the electronic equivalent of tea leaves.</TE>
<TE>   But those officials also said Wednesday that if Bin Laden had
indeed been killed in battle or died of some other causes, Al Qaeda
cell phones would be ringing off the hook, and e-mail messages and
other electronic communiques would be pinging from one end of the
globe to the other. And they said that Bin Laden's modus operandi
over the past many years has been to remain in contact with his
followers, publicly or through communiques, even when he goes
underground. Such communications would have been tracked, they say,
by the vast electronic eavesdropping capabilities of the National
Security Agency.</TE>
<TE>   ''Some things that one would expect to see if he were dead haven't
happened,'' said the intelligence official, declining to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Other officials, however, have sided with Watson. They say that if
Bin Laden were alive, there would be no way the National Security
Agency's electronic ears and other intelligence-gathering methods
would not have picked up some tidbit of corroborative evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, some of Bin Laden's close associates have been sighted
recently in other far-flung locations, the officials said. And
because these men were tremendously loyal to Bin Laden, the theory is
that they would not have left their leader's side except in the event
of his death.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, a London-based Arabic newspaper quoted a senior
Arab journalist close to Bin Laden as saying the fugitive Saudi
millionaire underwent surgery last year to remove shrapnel that
lodged in his shoulder during a U.S. bombing raid.</TE>
<TE>   And although that report said Bin Laden had recovered, one U.S.
congressional official who tracks Bin Laden said such an admission of
an injury is often the first step in formally conceding that a
powerful Islamic figure has been killed.</TE>
<TE>   ''We could be seeing a slow evolution toward acknowledging that
he's not alive,'' said the congressional official.</TE>
<TE>   Watson's comments came after weeks of mounting--and
conflicting--speculation about Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Several Bin Laden associates have publicly claimed he is alive,
well and planning new attacks. Leaders of foreign intelligence
services, such as August Hanning of Germany, claim to have
information indicating that Bin Laden is alive.</TE>
<TE>   ''We are convinced that Bin Laden is still alive and is planning
new attacks,'' Hanning, president of Germany's foreign intelligence
agency, said earlier this week. ''He is still the figurehead of Al
Qaeda, but doesn't appear to move around very much.''</TE>
<TE>   Others, such as Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, have said in
recent weeks that Bin Laden is dead.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has avoided saying whether the government believes
Bin Laden is dead or alive. President Bush said last week that the Al
Qaeda leader ''may be alive.''</TE>

<HD>Web Friend or Faux?</HD>
<DH>Digital 'buddies' are elaborate marketing tools, but their
lifelike responses in online instant messages can be misleading.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When none of her friends is online, 11-year-old Olga Szpiro sends her
artificial ones an instant message to chat.</LD>
<LD>   "hey ... welcome back!" one replies. "what can i do for u?"</LD>
<LD>   But unlike Olga, these friends don't just socialize. They sell.</LD>
<TE>   One markets movie tickets. Another talks up a reality television
show. A third pushes magazine subscriptions.</TE>
<TE>   In a culture inundated with advertising, companies have discovered
a new way to connect with consumers and make their messages stand out
amid the din. They are using digital "buddies" to spread word of
their products on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The buddies are software applications also known as "bots."
They're programmed to make friends and small talk, and they're eerily
good at it. They take cues from a human acquaintance's questions and
answers and search databases for conversational fodder. Bot-speak can
be formulaic and stilted. It can also be witty, provocative and
startlingly lifelike.</TE>
<TE>   Buddies are not mere motor-mouths. The more elaborate ones have
quirks, preferences, yearnings--virtual personalities.</TE>
<TE>   Their presence on the Web represents a powerful new dimension in
marketing. It's easy to ignore a billboard or flip past a magazine
ad, and many TV viewers reach for the remote the instant a commercial
appears.</TE>
<TE>   Web-based buddies, on the other hand, make a direct, even
intimate, connection with people. They allow companies to reach
potential customers one on one, typically in the privacy of their
homes. The marketing message need not be heavy-handed or obvious: It
can be artfully insinuated into light badinage between buddies.</TE>
<TE>   At least a dozen companies have deployed bots, using software
developed by ActiveBuddy Inc., a New York firm. Hooking up with human
pals through instant message services, they urge people to buy Ford
trucks, check out the eBay auction site and take in "The Lord of the
Rings."</TE>
<TE>   Appearing in Szpiro's personal message list every time she goes
online to chat with one of her San Fernando Valley classmates, they
are indefatigable and ever-present.</TE>
<TE>   Most buddies are programmed with personalities that appeal to
their target audiences. ELLEgirlBuddy, the Internet ego of teen
magazine ELLEgirl, is a redheaded 16-year-old who likes kickboxing,
the color periwinkle and French class.</TE>
<TE>   GooglyMinotaur, a buddy for the British progressive rock band
Radiohead, affected a British demeanor with words like "mate." The
Austin Powers buddy, which promotes the summer film "Goldmember,"
interjects the movie character's favorite phrases--"yeah, baby" and
"grrr"--into conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Some buddies are even programmed to express emotions--sadness,
frustration, desire. In the year since it debuted, people have told
SmarterChild, the demo buddy for ActiveBuddy, "I love you" more than
9 million times, the company reports. Every time, it's responded: "I
love you."</TE>
<TE>   Though most users understand they are communicating with a
computer, some engage in deep conversation with buddies, talking to
them as they would to friends. College students look them up late at
night. Teenagers consult them about fashion faux pas and weight
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Such exchanges reveal how technology can assume a lifelike
character in people's minds, even when it's just an elaborate
advertisement.</TE>
<TE>   "People forget in very profound ways that they are talking to
nothing," said Sherry Turkle, director of MIT's initiative on
technology and self.</TE>
<TE>   Talking Back</TE>
<TE>   Computers first chatted in the mid-1960s, when MIT professor
Joseph Weizenbaum created a software program called Eliza. Designed
to converse in the manner of a psychotherapist, Eliza asked people
questions by rephrasing their previous statements. The "patient"
typed questions on a keyboard. Eliza's answer appeared on the screen
moments later.</TE>
<TE>   In a typical exchange, a user said that she was "depressed much of
the time."</TE>
<TE>   "I am sorry to hear you are depressed," Eliza replied.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true. I am unhappy," the person typed.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you think coming here will help you not to be unhappy?" Eliza
asked.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Eliza's chat partners thought they were communicating with
a human being. A few even formed emotional bonds with the program.
Disturbed by these reactions, Weizenbaum lost his enthusiasm for
artificial intelligence and wrote a book warning of its potential
dangers.</TE>
<TE>   The technology has only grown more sophisticated since then.</TE>
<TE>   Today's buddies operate through instant message services such as
America Online's AIM and Microsoft Corp.'s MSN Messenger, which allow
people to communicate in real time at their keyboards. A buddy can't
crash into someone's cyberspace; they have to be invited. Users
maintain online lists of friends and send them instant messages by
clicking on their screen names. People add digital buddies to their
lists after learning of them by word of mouth or from Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   When a user clicks on a buddy's screen name, a computer server
receives the message. By analyzing key words, it interprets what the
user is saying and formulates an appropriate response.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, a buddy's spiel is tailored to the products or services
of its sponsoring company. TheSportingNews offered sports scores.
TattleTeller dished Hollywood gossip. Agent Reuters looks up stock
quotes.</TE>
<TE>   Bots can promote causes as well as companies. The Virginia Tobacco
Settlement Foundation recently launched an anti-smoking buddy that
says, among other things, "Smoking can really make you sick."</TE>
<TE>   Buddies can also serve as research tools. Rather than scour a Web
site for a particular fact, a user can send a buddy an instant
message--"What is the weather in Los Angeles?"--and receive an answer
in seconds.</TE>
<TE>   When developers created the software for buddies, they focused on
delivering information, not making chitchat, said Stephen Klein,
ActiveBuddy's chief executive. But after launching their demo buddy
last year, company officials discovered that users engaged it in
lengthy chat sessions, sometimes submitting more than a hundred
messages in one sitting. So programmers tweaked the software to
improve its chat capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Buddies don't always understand a user's submission and sometimes
ask for clarification, but their responses often seem quite human.
Tell SmarterChild that you are sad, and it replies that "there are
plenty of things to feel good about ... listen to music, go for a
walk, learn something new, read a book, be creative." Use vulgar
language and it asks you to "play nice." Request a kiss and it
obliges with three Xs.</TE>
<TE>   The buddy can recite lyrics to "The Star-Spangled Banner" and,
with a human partner for a straight man, perform Abbott and
Costello's famous comedy routine, "Who's on First?"</TE>
<TE>   More than 8 million people have added SmarterChild to their
personal message lists, creating almost a cult following. Hundreds of
users have posted their conversations with the bot online, including
propositions for cyber sex and at least one fake suicide attempt.</TE>
<TE>   One fan Web site, Imaddict.com, displays portions of several dozen
conversations with the buddy.</TE>
<TE>   "So will you go out with me?" one user asked.</TE>
<TE>   "You're human, I'm a machine," the buddy replied. "I don't think
that would work out."</TE>
<TE>   After reviewing logs of conversations, company officials were
surprised by the intimacy of some chats. "Some people are very, very
close to it," said Chris Bray, ActiveBuddy's vice president of
application development.</TE>
<TE>   During one chat with SmarterChild, Megan Romigh, 21, of Massena,
N.Y., told it she was lonely and wanted to be friends. Romigh was
kidding. But the Columbia University student recalled that she became
upset with the buddy when it responded: "Maybe, maybe not. You know
how it is."</TE>
<TE>   "With a computer, you don't know what's on the other side," Romigh
said. "You have the emotion, but the computer doesn't."</TE>
<TE>   ActiveBuddy's bots save details about each user--names, birth
dates, even instances when the person used offensive language. When
the buddy recalls these facts, it could appear to the user that it is
taking a genuine interest in him or her.</TE>
<TE>   "We're programmed to respond to certain signals as though in the
presence of a life form," said MIT's Turkle. "These objects are
pushing our buttons."</TE>
<TE>   Almost the Real Thing</TE>
<TE>   ELLEgirlBuddy lives in San Francisco with her mother, father and
older brother. Her favorite book is "Catcher in the Rye." Her
favorite television show is "Buffy the Vampire Slayer." And her
favorite band is No Doubt. When she grows up, she wants to design
handbags, own a bookstore cafe and work overseas as a foreign
correspondent.</TE>
<TE>   "i looove making my own clothes," ELLEgirlBuddy says in an instant
message. "i use gap tees a lot. you just shrink em and add ribbons.
insta-chic! i like kickboxing (major crush on gabe, my kickboxing
instructor! :-*). reading... i like 2 curl up with a book and an
extra-chocolaty mocha. yum!"</TE>
<TE>   The buddy--launched in mid-February to drive users to the Web site
for ELLEgirl magazine--responds to questions as a 16-year-old girl
would. It has programmed answers to questions about ELLEgirlBuddy's
family, school and aspirations. The bot's personality is so developed
that some girls see it as a cyber confidant, writing to it about bad
haircuts and image problems.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something you wouldn't ask a computer," said Judy Koutsky,
senior director of ELLEgirl.com. "It's almost like a girlfriend."</TE>
<TE>   Almost.</TE>
<TE>   The buddy provides information on fashion, beauty and horoscopes,
often including links to features on ELLEgirl.com. While gabbing
about lip gloss and prom gowns, it interjects occasional promos for
the magazine, urging girls to click on a link and "give the gift of
beauty--give a gift subscription to ELLEgirl magazine, get billed for
it later!"</TE>
<TE>   Online subscriptions to the magazine were seven times higher in
May than the month before the launch, in part because of the buddy,
Koutsky said.</TE>
<TE>   New Line Cinema released its RingMessenger buddy in November to
promote "The Lord of the Rings." Besides detailing the movie's plot,
it provided show times and links to New Line's online store. The
buddy was such a success that New Line recently introduced an Austin
Powers bot to drum up interest in this month's opening of
"Goldmember."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a completely different type of marketing," said Gordon
Paddison, senior vice president of worldwide interactive marketing
and business development for New Line. "You follow people around, and
they can share [the application] with their friends. It's a very
unique tool, and it's sexy, and that's what is fun."</TE>
<TE>   The buddies' cute screen names and chatter may confuse some users
as to their true purpose. Olga Szpiro's father, Joe, said he knew
that his daughter played with the buddies but didn't know that some
of them were pushing products.</TE>
<TE>   ActiveBuddy logs all instant message conversations with its
buddies. Company officials say they use the logs to ensure that the
bots answer questions appropriately, not for marketing. User names
are removed to protect identities, the company says.</TE>
<TE>   But it's only a matter of time before such conversations are
collected and analyzed for marketing purposes, said Paul Saffo,
director of the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park. "People are
interested in trying it now, but the tools aren't there yet," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Though instant message services are regulated to some degree by
the companies that provide them, Saffo said that "people worse than
advertisers" could create their own buddies, to serve their own aims.</TE>
<TE>   "Where advertisers have started, everyone else is going to go," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Thinking Computer</TE>
<TE>   People tinkering with bots--researchers and hobbyists as well as
professional programmers--look to something called the Turing Test to
judge their success. The test is named for the late Alan Turing, a
British mathematician who in a 1950 journal article raised the idea
that machines could think.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Turing Test, a person communicates with a computer and a
human being, both unseen, and tries to tell from their responses
which is which. If the tester cannot distinguish man from machine,
the computer is judged to be intelligent.</TE>
<TE>   Long before ActiveBuddy's buddies had been unleashed on the Web,
countless bots had been developed at research labs and universities
to chat--even flirt--with people. For more than a decade, programmers
have competed in an annual contest to put their bots to the Turing
Test.</TE>
<TE>   Their innovations seem certain to make these digital creations
even more clever and convincing. The technology may become so
sophisticated that buddies will be able to talk among themselves.</TE>
<TE>   ActiveBuddy is working on a personal buddy capable of responding
to instant messages for its owner when he or she is not online.
Potentially, two buddies could schedule meetings or lunch dates
without having to bother their owners.</TE>
<TE>   After all, unlike people, buddies are always online.</TE>
<TE>   "ELLEgirlBuddy is right smack there next to Susie and Tommy and
Johnny," said ActiveBuddy's Klein. "[It's] there 24 hours a day,
seven days a week."</TE>

<HD>Bush Defends Cheney on SEC Probe</HD>
<DH>Business: President says he has confidence that the vice
president will be cleared in the inquiry of a firm he once headed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush, faced anew with questions stemming from his
administration's close ties to big business, said Wednesday he
expects Vice President Dick Cheney to be cleared by a Securities and
Exchange Commission investigation into the accounting practices of
the Texas firm Cheney once led.</LD>
<LD>   ''I've got great confidence in the vice president,'' Bush said at
the White House when asked about the probe of Halliburton Inc. ''When
I picked him, I knew he was a fine business leader and a fine,
experienced man. And he's doing a great job.''</LD>
<LD>   During a joint press conference with visiting Polish President
Aleksander Kwasniewski, Bush also rebuffed calls for more details of
his own business practices as a Texas oil executive in the early
1990s.</LD>
<TE>   Bush dismissed suggestions that he authorize the SEC to release
the entire file of its inquiry into a 1990 stock sale he made, saying
the transaction has been ''fully investigated by career
investigators'' who found that ''there was no case.''</TE>
<TE>   The persistent questions were a reminder of the cloud that hovers
over an administration laden with former captains of industry at a
time when corporate executive behavior is under intense scrutiny as a
result of a spate of accounting scandals.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the scandals may not have seriously affected Bush's
standing. A Washington Post poll released Wednesday found his job
approval rating standing firm at 72%--virtually unchanged from a
month ago.</TE>
<TE>   ''I'm a little surprised, given the extent of the coverage,''
White House Budget Director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. told reporters
during a breakfast meeting, adding that he regarded some of the
coverage as unfair and distorted.</TE>
<TE>   But some analysts believe that Bush--and Cheney--may have a harder
time staying immune from the corporate-scandals fallout if the stock
market keeps dropping.</TE>
<TE>   A nationwide poll released Tuesday by Zogby International found
some slippage for Bush, contrary to the Post survey.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's approval rating was 62% in the Zogby poll--still a strong
showing, but the first time the figure had slipped below 65% since
Sept. 11</TE>
<TE>   ''I think both [Bush and Cheney] will be dogged by this for some
time, but especially Cheney,'' said Larry J. Sabato, a University of
Virginia political scientist. ''That's because the Halliburton
controversy is ''really quite recent, and it relates directly to the
current overall scandal of corporate irresponsibility,'' Sabato said.</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, Democrats may conduct hearings on Halliburton's
accounting practices in the wake of a recent shareholders' lawsuit
filed by a conservative watchdog group alleging that the firm
overstated its revenue by as much as $445 million from 1999 through
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Halliburton officials have denied any wrongdoing, and the White
House said the lawsuit by Judicial Watch lacks merit.</TE>
<TE>   Among those calling for hearings is Rep. Henry A. Waxman of Los
Angeles, the top Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee.
Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), chairman of the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, also said hearings may be in order.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, spokesman Ari Fleischer denounced the talk of
hearings as ''old-style politics'' aimed at personal destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt, whom Democrats have
accused of being too lax in enforcing securities laws, vowed to
''follow the trail wherever it leads'' in its Halliburton probe. ''No
one gets a pass,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC in May disclosed that it was opening an investigation into
the methods Halliburton used to account for cost overruns in
construction jobs in a way that seemed to inflate profits.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney left the company in August 2000 to become Bush's running
mate.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Cheney made an $18.5-million profit selling his
Halliburton stock. Two months later, the firm revealed that its
business was way off, causing prices to fall sharply.</TE>
<TE>   To date, there have been no allegations of wrongdoing by Cheney.</TE>
<TE>   When asked specifically whether he is confident that Cheney did
nothing wrong at Halliburton, an energy services firm that he served
as CEO, the president replied:</TE>
<TE>   ''Yes, I am.''</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Millerwise, Cheney's press secretary, said the SEC has
not contacted the vice president's office. She also said it would be
inappropriate for Cheney to comment on the probe.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC investigation of Bush concerned his sale of stock in the
Harken Energy Corp. for nearly $850,000. Bush served on the company's
board.</TE>
<TE>   The stock sale occurred just weeks before the value plummeted. The
sale led to an insider trading inquiry by the SEC, but the agency
closed the investigation after finding ''insufficient evidence'' to
proceed.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Halliburton case, Sabato said, the Harken matter is
unlikely to cause problems for the White House because it is 12 years
old and there has been ''at least a stab at an investigation by
SEC.''</TE>
<TE>   Despite the questions about Harken and Halliburton, Bush seemed in
an upbeat mood during much of the 32-minute press conference, winking
repeatedly at reporters in the East Room and making asides to several
in the first row.</TE>
<TE>   Bush earlier had welcomed Kwasniewski during a ceremony on the
South Lawn, complete with a 21-gun salute and a review of troops.</TE>
<TE>   Kwasniewski is only the second foreign leader to be accorded a
state visit by Bush. The first was Mexican President Vicente Fox,
feted at the White House almost a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   In an Oval Office meeting, Bush and Kwasniewski discussed a range
of issues, including greater cooperation on military and economic
matters. Today, the pair of leaders are traveling to two Detroit
suburbs to visit with Polish Americans. Their spouses are going to
Philadelphia to tour the Polish American Cultural Center and the
Philadelphia Academy of Fine Arts.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A Senate committee unanimously approved the nomination of Dr. Richard
Carmona as surgeon general Wednesday, despite questions about his
medical record and work history.</LD>
<LD>   The vote by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions
Committee was conducted quickly at an informal meeting just off the
Senate floor. The nomination now goes to the full Senate, which must
confirm Carmona to the post, which has been vacant since Dr. David
Satcher's term expired in February.</LD>
<LD>   The surgeon general has a tiny staff, must rely on other agencies
for his budget and holds little power. But the position has proved to
be a powerful bully pulpit for disseminating health information.</LD>
<TE>   At a hearing last week, Carmona, an Arizona trauma surgeon and
part-time sheriff's deputy, faced numerous questions about his
record. Critics have questioned his qualifications and suggested he
lacks the temperament for the post, and have cited reports that it
took him eight years to be certified in his field, general surgery,
after failing the test twice.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona did not deny that it took him eight years to get certified
but said no one had ever questioned his abilities.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), committee chairman, said
Wednesday that Carmona deserved to be confirmed to the post.</TE>

<HD>Date-Rape Drug OKd to Treat Sleep Disorder</HD>
<DH>Health: The FDA says GHB can help the 50,000 people
afflicted by cataplexy, a sudden loss of muscle tone affecting
narcolepsy sufferers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A drug implicated in date rapes and nightclub deaths won federal
approval Wednesday for treating a rare type of sleeping disorder,
under special restrictions aimed at stopping its diversion to
nonmedical uses.</LD>
<LD>   GHB, or gamma hydroxybutyrate, has an unusual four-decade history
of use as an anesthetic, a body-building supplement and a party drug
popular on the rave scene. But reports of deaths and seizures among
users and the drug's ability to incapacitate rape victims prompted
Congress in 2000 to toughen laws for its possession and distribution.</LD>
<LD>   The drug was sometimes manufactured at home, and it was linked to
at least 58 deaths and 5,700 overdoses between 1990 and 2000. The
Food and Drug Administration banned its marketing in 1990 and barred
all chemical analogues a decade later.</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, however, the FDA approved the drug for use by
individuals with cataplexy, a sudden loss of muscle tone that can
cause a person to collapse. Cataplexy affects an estimated 50,000 of
the 120,000 or so people with narcolepsy, a sleep disorder.</TE>
<TE>   FDA officials said they had worked with the Drug Enforcement
Administration and the drug's manufacturer, Orphan Medical Inc. of
Minnetonka, Minn., to design strict restrictions on the distribution
of GHB.</TE>
<TE>   Patients will be able to obtain the drug only through a single
pharmacy, which will keep a master list of people receiving it and
doctors prescribing it. The list, the drug company and the FDA said,
will allow the pharmacy to detect whether patients are refilling
prescriptions too quickly or are obtaining prescriptions from several
doctors--both indications of possible misuse of the drug.</TE>
<TE>   ''The physician will receive a phone call after every prescription
to validate the prescription,'' said Dr. William Houghton, executive
vice president for scientific affairs at Orphan Medical. Patients
must also tell the pharmacy by phone that they have read an
educational packet that explains the dangers of misuse and the
correct way to dispose of unused medication.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is about as restrictive an approval that I've been a part
of,'' said Dr. Russell Katz, chief of the FDA's neurological drugs
division. ''No system is 100% fail-safe. Things can happen, of
course. But we thought this was a system that for the most part will
ensure a minimum to no diversion, and hopefully safe use of the
drug.''</TE>
<TE>   The drug will be sold under the name Xyrem.</TE>
<TE>   Restrictions on the sale of a medicine are unusual, but not
unique. Patients cannot obtain the anti-psychotic drug clozapine
without showing the results of a blood test, Katz said. The
requirement is aimed at preventing a life-threatening decrease in
white blood cells. And when RU-486, the ''abortion pill,'' came to
market in 2000, the manufacturer said it would distribute the
medication through doctors, not pharmacists.</TE>
<TE>   An advisory panel of the FDA had ruled previously that GHB was
effective in treating cataplexy, but split on whether it was safe to
market, Katz said.</TE>
<TE>   He said final approval was granted in part because cataplexy is a
''devastating condition'' and because there is no other approved
treatment for it.</TE>
<TE>   Usually triggered by strong emotional states, such as laughter or
sadness, cataplexy causes a loss of muscle tone that can range in
severity, causing eyelids to droop, speech to slur or knees to
buckle. Patients are conscious during the episode, but they are
unable to move certain muscles.</TE>
<TE>   The condition is one symptom of narcolepsy, a disease
characterized by an irresistible tendency to fall asleep, even during
a conversation or a meal.</TE>

<HD>Access Rules on Generic Drugs May Be Eased</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate, weighing legislation designed to cope with the rising
costs of prescription medicine, signaled support Wednesday for the
idea of forcing drug manufacturers to reduce their U.S. prices to
what they charge overseas.</LD>
<LD>   In a pair of votes on amendments, the Senate decided 99 to 0 to
require the secretary of Health and Human Services to certify that
importation of generic drugs would pose no significant safety risk
and would result in significant savings.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, senators voted 69 to 30 to allow the secretary to
block that supply line if evidence develops that shows that consumer
safeguards are insufficient.</LD>
<TE>   A more sweeping amendment to the legislation written to ease
public access to generic drugs likely will be approved today. That
provision would allow drugstores and medical distributors to buy
U.S.-made drugs in Canada, where they are cheaper, and resell them in
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   For some time now, many lawmakers and health-care groups have
complained that drugs are cheaper across the border in Canada--and
thousands of older Americans have traveled there by bus to drive home
the point.</TE>
<TE>   The bill's goal "is to try to force a repricing of prescription
drugs in this country," said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.), one of
the measure's sponsors. "The American consumer is charged
dramatically more for the same prescription drug. It's unfair."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats had initially opposed the HHS certification provision,
offered by Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), arguing that it would weaken
the bill. But Cochran said that without the certification provision,
"there's no guarantee of their safety or efficacy."</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers were still gridlocked over several competing plans to
add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. None of the plans has
the 60 votes needed for passage.</TE>
<TE>   Off-the-floor talks center mostly on a plan offered by Senate
Democrats that would cost up to $500 billion over 10 years and a
$370-billion plan offered by a tripartisan group of Democrats,
Republicans and an independent.</TE>
<TE>   In a sign that Democrats were willing to make changes, Senate
Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said he would be "flexible"
despite his support for the Democratic bill.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really not interested in drawing any hard lines in the sand
here," Daschle said. "I think that there is a real possibility that
some compromise is within our grasp."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Senate Democrats prepared to release a report today
that gives a state-by-state look at how senior citizens would fare
under the Democratic plan and competing proposals.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Studies Foam Bombs Among Options to Isolate Chemical
Weapons</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Defense researchers are pursuing novel ways to disable chemical and
biological weapons, including a missile that would isolate weapon
storage sites by coating them in an impenetrable foam.</LD>
<LD>   The foam bomb is one of several weapons on the drawing board that
could include toxic or other materials loaded on an earth-penetrating
warhead. The idea is to neutralize, rather than blow up, underground
storage sites for weapons of mass destruction, Stephen M. Younger,
director of the Pentagon's Defense Threat Reduction Agency, said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The approach would enable U.S. forces to isolate chemical and
biological weapons in urban areas without bombing them, which carries
the risk of releasing chemical or biological agents into the
atmosphere, endangering soldiers and civilians.</LD>
<TE>   Work on the concept comes as the Bush administration weighs an
invasion of Iraq that, military analysts say, would leave President
Saddam Hussein with little to lose by unleashing weapons of mass
destruction on an invading U.S. army whose goal would be his removal.</TE>
<TE>   Defense officials also voice concern that terrorists could team up
with Iraq or other nations with the capacity to develop chemical,
biological, or even nuclear weapons. Iraq, listed by the State
Department as a state sponsor of terrorism, is believed to have
furthered its research into chemical and biological weapons since the
Gulf War and has shown a keen interest in developing nuclear weapons,
Younger said.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. weapons inspectors believe Hussein has placed arsenals of the
taboo weapons beneath hospitals in urban Baghdad. Some of the devices
under consideration by the Pentagon could kill organic agents in an
enclosed space with intense and extended heat. Among the more
controversial weapons are nuclear-tipped missiles designed to
penetrate deep into the earth.</TE>
<TE>   Some concepts remain years away, likely too late for an invasion
of Iraq. But Younger suggested researchers are close to beginning
development on others.</TE>
<TE>   ''The component technologies are there. The basic research has
been done,'' Younger said. ''It may not be years [away] in some
cases.''</TE>
<TE>   But he said more work needs to be done on key technologies
allowing soldiers to detect chemical and particularly biological
weapons at a safe distance.</TE>
<TE>   Detection of chemical and biological weapons has improved since
the Gulf War and soldiers deployed in Iraq would be given chemical
suits and probably vaccines for smallpox and other diseases. Yet the
risks are ''still unacceptably high'' for soldiers, Younger said,
largely because reliable detection systems that can pinpoint multiple
agents at a distance are still being developed.</TE>
<TE>   Younger's agency, based at Ft. Belvoir, Va., is charged with
developing ways to deter nuclear assaults and reduce the threat from
all types of weapons. The agency, part of the Department of Defense,
has also been consulted for domestic strategy as the Bush
administration creates the Department of Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   One common theme is the need for weapons that penetrate deep into
the ground.</TE>
<TE>   ''Deeply buried, hardened targets are sort of the target of choice
right now,'' said Clark Murdoch, a former Air Force director for
planning who is now with the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a foreign policy think-tank.</TE>
<TE>   That priority stems not only from intelligence on the location of
weapons sites in Iraq but experience in the war in Afghanistan. U.S.
warplanes, targeting pro-Taliban fighters hiding in caves and
tunnels, dropped the first earth-shuddering thermobaric explosive,
the BLU-118, in the mountains in March. The device sends a
slow-release pulse of destructive energy deep below the earth
surface.</TE>
<TE>   Classified documents call for exploring the development of
nuclear-tipped missiles. While the concept has been criticized for
its potential to lower the threshold for nuclear attacks or to launch
a new nuclear small arms race, defense officials think modifying
weapons might be less controversial.</TE>
<TE>   Under one scenario, for example, a B-61--a bomb that can be
modified to deliver varying amounts of explosive power--could be used
to penetrate underground bunkers.</TE>
<TE>   ''The B-61 warhead is the only nuclear weapon at this time that's
configured for any kind of penetration before it explodes,'' Murdoch
said.</TE>
<TE>   But military analysts say it remains unclear how deep such a
weapon would have to go to reduce the spread of radiation to
acceptable levels.</TE>

<HD>House Gives Indians a Win in Funds Challenge</HD>
<DH>Congress: Lawmakers defeat a move to derail a full
accounting of royalties owed by the government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Native Am- ericans who claim the government squandered billions in
revenue from their land won a victory Wednesday when the House killed
a provision that would have prevented a full accounting of the money.</LD>
<LD>   Congress had ordered the accounting in 1994 to determine the scope
of government mismanagement of royalties from Indian lands. A federal
judge ruled in 1999 that the accounting must go back to 1887, when
the Indians were given plots of land, with the Interior Department
responsible for management of the land.</LD>
<LD>   The language in the Interior Appropriations Bill would have
essentially overridden the judge's ruling, prohibiting an accounting
before 1985.</LD>
<TE>   Rep. Nick J. Rahall II (D-W.Va.) called the Interior Department
"the Enron of federal agencies" for its management of the Indian
money and said removing the accounting prohibition was a matter of
fairness.</TE>
<TE>   "This provision is nothing more and nothing less than a gag order
on thousands of American Indians who are seeking a proper accounting
from the federal government of royalties owed to them," said Rahall.</TE>
<TE>   The House voted 281 to 145 to eliminate the provision.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Jim Kolbe (R-Ariz.) said Congress needs to get the Indian
trust fund dispute resolved. Limiting the accounting to 1985 would
have actually allowed it to be accomplished, he said; otherwise, the
additional cost of doing the accounting could divert funds from other
Indian programs.</TE>
<TE>   Indians who have sued the government claim the Interior
Department's mismanagement has cost them more than $10 billion. The
department insists the figure is much lower.</TE>
<TE>   The Interior Department estimates it would cost $2.4 billion and
take at least 10 years to perform the full accounting, a task that
would entail combing through 25 million electronic transactions and
500 million paper records.</TE>
<TE>   To perform the accounting back to 1985 would cost $907 million,
the department said.</TE>
<TE>   In February, Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton told Congress that
many records have been destroyed, damaged or lost and a full
accounting may not be possible.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's House action may force the department to face that
fact, said Keith Harper, an attorney for the Indian plaintiffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they have no sanctuary--not the Congress not the courts," he
said. "Ultimately, I think what this is going to lead to is the
admission finally by the administration that they cannot do a full or
fair accounting and there has to be some other resolution by the
court."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, impatient with the delays in
conducting the accounting he ordered in 1999, is considering whether
to hold Norton in contempt of court.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the accounting provision, the House stripped out
language that would have allowed the Interior Department to pay for
private attorneys for officials in contempt proceedings and would
have required the Interior Department to release a partial
accounting, which Lamberth has sealed.</TE>

<HD>Charge Cards Used for Lap Dances</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Some 200 Army personnel used government charge cards to get $38,000
in cash that they spent on "lap dancing and other forms of
entertainment" at strip clubs near military bases, Sen. Charles E.
Grassley (R-Iowa) said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Citing a congressional investigation, Grassley said the soldiers
used their military identification and government travel cards to
obtain cash from adult entertainment bars, spending the money there.</LD>
<LD>   The General Accounting Office, which conducted the investigation,
said the clubs charged a 10% fee to supply the soldiers with cash,
and billed their travel cards for the full amount as a restaurant
charge.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, 1.4 million defense employees with government travel
cards charged $2.1 billion; and 230,000 Defense Department workers
used purchase cards for $6.1 billion in goods and services.</TE>

<LD>Last in an occasional series</LD>
<LD>   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- His mother bled to death in the back of the
ambulance during the long ride to the hospital that accepted blacks.
She was the mother of 10, and he was her baby, just 4 months old.</LD>
<LD>   The city was aflame with race riots that night in 1964, but
Johnnie Mae Chappell was not out setting fires. She had gone for ice
cream for her family. She was in front of the Banner Food Market on
New Kings Road when four white men in a dark blue Plymouth drove
past. One of them shot her in the abdomen.</LD>
<TE>   "Mister police officer," she told the white policeman who was
first at the scene, "I'm going to die."</TE>
<TE>   By year's end, four men were arrested and charged in her death,
and three of them confessed. But only one was tried, and he was
convicted of a reduced charge of manslaughter when jurors concluded
it was a joy ride by young toughs and the gun had gone off
accidentally. He served three years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Criminal cases against the other three were never pursued.</TE>
<TE>   Johnnie Mae's boy, Shelton Chappell, is a man now, and he has been
piecing together the events that took away his mother. He questioned
his reluctant father before his death, and pored over the few court
records that still exist. Only in the last few years did he come to
fully understand what happened that night, and what followed her
death.</TE>
<TE>   He learned that the brief homicide report was hidden from
investigators. That there are no incident reports, no crime scene
photos. That the murder weapon disappeared from the evidence room,
and is missing to this day.</TE>
<TE>   And that the two white deputies who investigated the case were
fired after complaining of a cover-up.</TE>
<TE>   He learned all this from the fired deputies themselves, now well
into retirement.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, one of them, Lee Cody, came across a newspaper notice
about a Chappell family gathering to mark the anniversary of their
mother's death.</TE>
<TE>   Cody was living on a houseboat nearby. He had long ago moved on
with his life after his days as a sheriff's deputy.</TE>
<TE>   "And I thought, that's Johnnie Mae's son," he said. "I knew I had
to tell him."</TE>
<TE>   He waited in the shadows at the back of the hall during the family
reunion, then nervously stepped forward. The tall, white-haired white
man gently shook hands with the small, determined black man.</TE>
<TE>   They formed an alliance that has since been joined by another
voice from the past: a man who implicates his own father in the
cover-up, then-Chief of Detectives J.C. Patrick.</TE>
<TE>   Their testimony is at the center of a civil lawsuit filed by
Shelton Chappell in federal court against city and police officials
in Jacksonville and all four men, asking for a jury trial to air the
family's complaints of a wrongful death and attempted cover-up. The
suit is under review by the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta; a judge initially threw it out because it was filed too
late.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, a handful of white men have been convicted in
slayings of blacks in the 1960s, raising hopes in other long-dormant
civil rights cases. The most recent was the conviction of Bobby Frank
Cherry for his role in a Birmingham, Ala., church bombing that killed
four black girls nearly 40 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But there are scores of unsolved, race-driven killings of blacks
that never will be resolved. And even the relative handful of old
cases that are being revived appear to have slim prospects for
successful prosecution. Witnesses and suspects die, paperwork is
lost, evidence is thrown out. In many cases the original
investigations were so shoddy that there is little evidence to
resurrect decades later.</TE>
<TE>   The case of Johnnie Mae Chappell has not been taken up by law
enforcement authorities--partly because one of her assailants was
convicted at the time and sent to prison.</TE>
<TE>   But to some, the seemingly reckless handling of the case showed a
criminal justice system rooted in time and place, and betrayed the
unwillingness of a white-run community to demand justice for all when
the victim was black and the killers were white.</TE>
<TE>   The son wants a justice that goes beyond the short prison sentence
served by just one of the men in the car, something that makes the
city of Jacksonville pay, something that acknowledges his mother died
a martyr in the civil rights movement.</TE>
<TE>   "If they want to take me to jail, I'm willing to go to jail; I'm
willing to die for this cause," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Where Jim Crow Ruled</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the killing, March 23, 1964, Jacksonville for
several days had been convulsed by race riots, touched off when a
group of blacks staged demonstrations at downtown hotels and
restaurants for equal rights and opportunities. The local newspaper
described them as "a mob of howling Negroes."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Haydon Burns deputized 496 white firefighters to combat
"hit-and-run" groups of protesters. He was angry that President
Johnson was about to sign the Civil Rights Act giving blacks access
to public facilities and new voting protections.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor was running for governor at the time, under the Jim Crow
segregation banner. He was elected to the post that November.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, Jim Crow ruled the city. Whites, including police
officers, were known to beat blacks, shoot their dogs and throw live
alligators into black-only swimming pools.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier on the day of the Chappell homicide, about 10
fire-bombings erupted. Three men were wounded. About 200 were
arrested, most of them black.</TE>
<TE>   It was clearly not safe to be out. But Shelton's mother walked to
the market anyway. When she returned to the family's small green
house on Pipit Street, on the city's far north side, she realized her
wallet had fallen through a hole in her shopping bag.</TE>
<TE>   So she retraced her steps. Across a field and three blocks from
home, she came back upon the small market. With her eyes presumably
fixed on the ground, it is doubtful she ever saw the dark sedan come
roaring by, or at first recognized the blast as anything other than a
backfire.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the dark she must have been an easy target, clearly
visible in her white jacket, white blouse and a white-and-black
skirt. For anyone firing out of a passing car window, even just for
fun, Johnnie Mae Chappell would have been hard to miss.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, Willie, was at home with the children. He had
finished plowing a neighbor's field, and he was tired. At word of the
shooting, he rushed out to New Kings Road, just in time to climb in
the back of the "colored" ambulance.</TE>
<TE>   Johnnie Mae was dead before they reached the black hospital. The
next morning, her killing would rate a bare mention in the
Jacksonville newspapers; the Journal gave it 35 words in a roundup
about the riots.</TE>
<TE>   The state of Florida broke up the family, ruling that Willie
Chappell, working as a cement finisher and a gas station attendant
when he wasn't plowing fields, could not properly raise the five boys
and five girls.</TE>
<TE>   Five months after the killing, no arrests had been made. That was
when Deputy Cody met a young white man at the local Freeze-It
drive-in. The man seemed to want to talk but then drove away.</TE>
<TE>   Cody said he and his partner, Donald Coleman, noticed that the
man, a local tough named Wayne Chessman, was driving a dark Plymouth.</TE>
<TE>   They drove to Chessman's home, peeked through the front screen and
found him lounging on a sofa. They brought him downtown and Cody
placed the Bible in front of him, turning to the part about "thou
shalt not kill."</TE>
<TE>   "He started swearing," Cody said, and then suddenly blurted out a
stunning admission. "He said, 'I didn't shoot her. I didn't shoot
her. I didn't shoot her. I was just riding in the car.' "</TE>
<TE>   Chessman talked plenty. Cody said he implicated the others, and
the deputies arrested all four, including the shooter, J.W. Rich.
Three of them, including Rich, agreed to talk. The deputies said the
men told them they had gone out joy riding and they were out to "get"
a black.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, accomplices are just as culpable as a shooter, and the
deputies were ecstatic: As far as they were concerned, they had
solved the murder. But when they went looking for the case file in
the squad room, it was not there.</TE>
<TE>   They checked the office of J.C. Patrick, the chief of detectives
who was away at the time. There, under Patrick's chair, Coleman spied
a piece of paper sticking out from beneath the rug. He pulled it out,
and realized it was the Chappell homicide report.</TE>
<TE>   It was all of a page and a half. It did note, however, that
Patrick had been at the scene. It described the victim as a "colored
female age 35." The suspects were "unknown at this time," the report
said.</TE>
<TE>   Cody also located a one-page supplementary report. Another
"colored female" had reported hearing a "bang," but when police
searched the area for clues "no information or evidence could be
found." The report did not even mention that the bullet had been
recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Cody was amazed that so little police work had been done. It
appeared to him that his superiors had shelved the investigation.
"Can you imagine what we were thinking then?" he asked. "Obviously,
the chief of detectives had obstructed justice in a capital civil
rights murder case."</TE>
<TE>   The deputies pressed ahead. They located the gun, a blue-steel
revolver similar to a target pistol, after their suspected assailants
helped lead them to it. The deputies bagged it and placed it in the
police property room.</TE>
<TE>   They complained to the sheriff about the original handling of the
case, and the next morning confronted Patrick. As Cody remembers it,
Patrick's face turned "blood red." He ordered them out of his office
and, before slamming the door behind them, warned, "Don't you try to
rock this boat, boys, because the anchor's too goddamn big."</TE>
<TE>   The deputies were taken off the case. Soon they were assigned jobs
serving warrants or acting as bailiffs. Eventually they were labeled
as disruptive employees, and a year later, fired.</TE>
<TE>   They took new jobs driving garbage trucks at the Jacksonville
shipyard, and from the sidelines Cody watched the justice system take
its course.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests stood. The men withdrew their guilty pleas, but then
were indicted by a grand jury. Yet, only Rich was prosecuted. His
trial lasted two days.</TE>
<TE>   He testified that they were passing the pistol around in the car
when "I just picked it up and looked at it and the gun just went
off." He refuted Deputy Coleman's testimony that they were out to
"get" a black.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors never entered the .22-caliber handgun into evidence at
the trial, making it physically impossible to tie the bullet to the
gun that killed her.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies Cody and Coleman do not know what became of the gun.</TE>
<TE>   The jury deliberated for one hour. Charged with first-degree
murder, which carried the death penalty, Rich was convicted of the
lesser charge of manslaughter. He was sentenced to 10 years and made
parole after three. The state dropped the charges against the other
men.</TE>
<TE>   After the trial before an all-white, all-male jury, juror James P.
Loos told the newspapers: "I think it was just a bunch of boys
horsing around at night. They were out there harassing blacks and
accidentally killed a woman."</TE>
<TE>   Loos, now 71, a retired electrical plant technician, repeats his
story today. He recalled that they passed the bullet around in the
jury box. The bullet appeared scratched or dented, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rich's defense attorney described growing up on a farm where hogs
were slaughtered. The hogs were shot between the eyes, and the
bullets were dented when they hit the skull. The Chappell bullet, he
reasoned, must have first hit the pavement and then ricocheted into
Johnnie Mae's right side.</TE>
<TE>   "They were messing around in their car," Loos said. "I don't
believe in my mind they had planned to kill anybody. They were young
and they ran off, and most of them got away."</TE>
<TE>   Some years later, Patrick, the chief of detectives, was drunk one
day and beating his wife when their son James came home from hunting.
He heard his mother's screams and ran upstairs with his shotgun. He
fired one shot of No. 4 duck load into his father and, he recalls,
"blew him in half."</TE>
<TE>   Chappell Kin Scattered</TE>
<TE>   After his mother's death, Shelton Chappell passed through a series
of foster homes. He never really knew his family, with all the
siblings scattered about. He was an adult by the time he began to
reacquaint himself.</TE>
<TE>   He knew little about his mother and still less about her death.
His father, whom he sometimes visited, would not talk about it.</TE>
<TE>   A neighbor, Marguerite Golson, lives near the old Chappell home.
She is 85 now, and she saw the family split up. Their home, she said,
was abandoned and then became a crack house. Today it is boarded
shut.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew Johnnie Mae. I'm a mother too," Golson said. "She worked
every day. She was nice. She always was in a hurry to go to work, or
in a hurry to get home and tend to her children. You always saw her
running for the bus."</TE>
<TE>   Willie Chappell spent the next 30 years keeping his head down,
wary of demanding greater justice.</TE>
<TE>   "He lived all alone afterward, with his dogs," Golson recalled.
"He cut wood. He lived independently and he didn't bother anybody. He
grieved a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Shelton kept pestering his father.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally, he would share some of it," the son said. "He said he
saw one of the men go to jail, and I guess he thought justice was
done. But if he had pushed it any further, they would have killed him
too."</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, a year before the old man died, father and son visited
the public library and police headquarters and the courthouse,
searching for clues about the case. Shelton had taken a brief leave
from his electrician's job in Miami, where he has a wife and young
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   They were shown the only surviving piece of evidence: the bullet.
"I looked for some blood on that bullet to make me feel something,"
Shelton said. "But I didn't see it."</TE>
<TE>   Shelton saved a little money and made a few more trips to
Jacksonville, searching records, learning what little there was about
her death, sometimes speaking out on his mother's behalf. Along the
way, he picked up some minor victories.</TE>
<TE>   The city erected a small sign on New Kings Road, "Drive Safely in
Memory of Johnnie Mae Chappell," plunked in a field next to a yellow
fireplug and a red fiber-optic cable.</TE>
<TE>   A church in Georgia dedicated a stained glass window in her name.
A civil rights memorial in Alabama added her to its list of martyrs.</TE>
<TE>   Other efforts have foundered.</TE>
<TE>   Four Florida governors have been asked to acknowledge that the
criminal justice system in Jacksonville had failed the Chappell
family; none has done so. The city has been asked to build a civil
rights memorial in Johnnie Mae Chappell's name; it has not.</TE>
<TE>   But when former Deputy Cody contacted the Chappell family six
years ago, Shelton knew his case had grown stronger. And then James
Patrick stepped forward.</TE>
<TE>   After killing his father, Patrick was briefly detained, then
released when the state ruled the death justifiable. Only in his own
mind does his father's demise have any bearing on the case of Johnnie
Mae Chappell.</TE>
<TE>   James Patrick, now 51 and seriously ill, felt shame after learning
about his father's role in the Chappell investigation. He had heard
the Chappell family was trying to get the case reopened. He offered
to testify about his father's racism and the slaying cover-up.</TE>
<TE>   His father, he recalls, would rail about blacks and Jews, yell at
the television whenever blacks appeared on screen, and often drag his
boy along to Ku Klux Klan picnics.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in heaven and hell, and I think he went to hell," the
son says. "He did a lot of things wrong, just covering things up.
That was enough to put him in hell.... She got shot aimlessly and my
old man didn't pay much attention to it. It was bad, it was all
wrong. It was coldblooded murder."</TE>
<TE>   The willingness of the old deputies and the detective's son to
support the Chappell family's campaign for justice seems to suggest
how attitudes have changed. But maybe not.</TE>
<TE>   When the family filed its lawsuit, their lawyer, a white man, soon
found his office defaced, with KKK and other messages spray-painted
on the exterior. Out at his farm, one of his horses was stabbed.</TE>
<TE>   None of the four men hired a lawyer to contest the suit, but three
of them wrote out in longhand their own responses and filed them with
the court.</TE>
<TE>   "There was not a conspiracy!" Rich wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Chessman denied any wrongdoing, dismissing the killing as an "act
supposedly ... committed almost forty (40) years ago." Suspect Elmer
Kato wrote a one-sentence denial of any allegations, and the fourth,
James Davis, did not respond.</TE>
<TE>   All four apparently still live around Jacksonville. They either
could not be reached or declined to talk. Rich reportedly has cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit was dismissed in December by U.S. District Judge
Harvey E. Schlesinger. He said the four-year statute of limitations
had run out for such a claim.</TE>
<TE>   The judge added: "There is no constitutional requirement that the
sheriff's department investigate crimes."</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor, like the sheriff, is dead. Scott Makar, assistant
general counsel for the Sheriff's Office, called the ruling sound.</TE>
<TE>   Makar also defended the decision long ago not to prosecute the
other three in the car.</TE>
<TE>   "If the guy who pulled the trigger just got manslaughter, are they
really going to convict the other three?" he asked. "And what
evidence is there today to show that those prosecutorial decisions
were not appropriate?"</TE>
<TE>   Shelton Chappell does not have much hope for his lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   What he does have is a photograph.</TE>
<TE>   It was taken after the ambulance reached the hospital. A
photographer for Jet magazine, in town covering the riots and hearing
of the Chappell shooting, rushed to the emergency room.</TE>

<HD>Jeb Bush's Daughter Jailed on Drug Count</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Gov. Jeb Bush's 24-year-old daughter was put in jail Wednesday after
officials said she failed to meet the requirements of a court-ordered
drug treatment program.</LD>
<LD>   Noelle Bush, the niece of President Bush, was arrested in January
after police said she attempted to buy Xanax, an anti-anxiety drug,
with a phony prescription.</LD>
<LD>   She entered a drug treatment center, with the understanding that
if she completed the program, charges against her would be dropped.</LD>
<TE>   A letter from the treatment center to state Judge Reginald
Whitehead said Bush had prescription pills in her possession that had
apparently been taken from a nurse's office. Bush said she had found
the pills, the letter said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a concern about her lack of honesty, and how it relates
to her" recovery, the center's letter said.</TE>
<TE>   After receiving the letter, Whitehead sentenced Bush to a
three-day jail term for contempt of court. She was taken into custody
in Orlando, Fla., and was scheduled to be released Friday, with
another hearing on her case to be held the same day.</TE>
<TE>   "My family is saddened to share that our daughter Noelle has not
abided by the conditions of her drug court treatment plan," the
governor said in an e-mail to reporters. "Unfortunately, this happens
to many individuals even as they continue their journey to full
recovery."</TE>
<TE>   "There are consequences for every action we take in our lives, and
as her parents, Columba and I wish we could have prevented our
daughter from making the wrong choices," Bush said. "We love Noelle,
but she is an adult, and I respect the role of the courts in carrying
out our state's drug treatment policies."</TE>
<TE>   Bush visited his daughter at the jail Wednesday night after a
speech in Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   "We're saddened and disappointed that my daughter's not complying
with the court order," Bush told the speech audience. "People that
have addictions don't recover in a perfect way. My daughter's not
perfect."</TE>
<TE>   Bush is running for reelection, and the latest polls indicate the
Republican incumbent should win handily, even if the strongest
Democratic candidate, former Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, receives her
party's nomination.</TE>
<TE>   The continuing problems of Bush's daughter should have no
political downside for him, an observer said.</TE>
<TE>   "The way the governor has handled this reminds us that this could
have happened to any family," said James Witt, a professor of
government at the University of West Florida in Pensacola. Officials
of the Orange County Corrections Department said that because of her
prominence, Bush would be given special protection behind bars. She
either will be confined in a cell by herself, or share a cell with
another person in protective custody.</TE>
<TE>   Noelle is the Bushes' only daughter. They have two sons, George
and Jeb Jr.</TE>

<HD>Nurse Accused of Four Killings</HD>
<DH>Crime: She is charged in deaths of patients at a rural
Texas hospital. More charges are possible, authorities say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIANNE HART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>A vocational nurse was charged Wednesday in the capital murders of
four patients under her care last year at a rural north Texas
hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Vickie Dawn Jackson, 36, is accused of killing her victims by
injecting them with a potent muscle-paralyzing drug, mivacurium
chloride, which stops a person's breathing. The youngest of the four
dead patients was 65.</LD>
<LD>   "The FBI laboratory determined that mivacurium chloride was
present in the bodies of the victims that have been included in the
indictments," said Montague County Dist. Atty. Tim Cole. "There's no
legitimate reason, no medical reason in those cases for that to be
found."</LD>
<TE>   As many as 20 people may have been given lethal doses of the drug
at tiny Nocona General Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Nocona, an agriculture and oil town of 3,100, is about 100 miles
north of Dallas near the Oklahoma state line.</TE>
<TE>   "It is possible that we will file other counts of capital murder,"
said Cole, who is awaiting the results of FBI testing on six bodies
exhumed last year.</TE>
<TE>   Cole said he hasn't decided whether he will seek the death penalty
in what he declined to call mercy killings. "I personally don't find
it too merciful to kill people in this way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The unusually high number of deaths at the 38-bed hospital has
been a town mystery for months. Hospital officials became alarmed
when they realized that patients died at twice the usual rate from
December 2000 to January 2001. Their suspicions deepened when they
discovered that four of 10 vials of mivacurium chloride were missing,
and that most of the deaths occurred during Jackson's shift.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson had worked at the hospital for a year until February 2001,
when the Texas Rangers, Nocona Police and FBI began investigating the
case. That summer, 10 bodies were exhumed and grieving families have
been waiting for answers.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson stayed in the area, eventually finding a job at a grocery
store deli, where she was arrested Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   She remains in jail on $2-million bond.</TE>
<TE>   Michael R. Graham, the hospital's chief executive, said that while
"today's actions will in no way bring peace to the broken families
who have lost loved ones," they are "a very healthy first step to
finding out what has happened."</TE>
<TE>   "When you have an alleged serial killer working in your hospital,
it doesn't matter what policies and procedures you have in place.
That person's going to do what they're going to do," Graham said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the victims identified in the indictment was Oma Wyler, who
was 95 when she entered Nocona hospital in January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   She suffered from congestive heart failure, but the mother of six
had worked for years as a cook at the local high school. She was
strong, her family said. Wyler quickly rallied and was preparing to
go home a week later when she unexpectedly died.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought at first she had just expired," said Wanda Russell,
the eldest of Wyler's daughters.</TE>
<TE>   "Then we started hearing about other sudden deaths and we started
looking back. Did someone kill my mother? I was so angry for so long.
I felt like Vickie Jackson pushed my mother into heaven. I'm resigned
to it now. I would like to hear her motive. You always want to know
why."</TE>

<HD>House, Senate Leaders Move on an Accounting Bill</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Amid pressure to act, GOP names negotiators to
reconcile two measures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Under pressure from the White House and the public to act on
corporate reform, House and Senate leaders moved Wednesday to begin
talks on the final version of legislation to crack down on accounting
abuses--and set a goal of finishing work before Congress adjourns for
its August recess.</LD>
<LD>   House Republican leaders have balked at speeding the process by
simply accepting the more stringent bill approved unanimously earlier
this week by the Senate. Instead, they insist on formal negotiations
to reconcile differences between the Senate bill and a measure the
House passed in April.</LD>
<LD>   Faced with charges of foot dragging, House GOP leaders on
Wednesday named negotiators to work with Senate counterparts and said
they hoped the House would have a final bill to approve before the
end of next week. Senate approval presumably would follow within
days.</LD>
<TE>   House Financial Services Committee Chairman Michael G. Oxley
(R-Ohio), a vocal critic of the Senate bill, had wanted a more
leisurely timetable for negotiations. But Wednesday, he acknowledged
that political pressures made that unrealistic.</TE>
<TE>   ''In the best of worlds, it might be nice to have a cooling-off
period,'' Oxley said. ''But we're not in that world. You play the
cards you're dealt.''</TE>
<TE>   The schedule laid out by House leaders, if followed, would be a
setback for business lobbyists. ''It makes my job a lot harder,''
said Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, who has been lobbying against key provisions in the Senate
bill.</TE>
<TE>   Lobbyists such as Josten want to postpone final action on the bill
until after the August recess. That would give them more time to
fight provisions they oppose and, perhaps, slow the momentum for
legislation that has been fueled by public anxiety about stock market
instability.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats remained skeptical that GOP negotiators would be willing
to compromise enough to finish talks by the end of next week. Indeed,
the House was not in a compromising mood Wednesday when, after naming
conferees, they voted, 218 to 207, against a resolution endorsing the
Senate bill's provisions setting stricter penalties for corporate
misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   ''How serious are they in terms of negotiating?'' said Jesse
Jacobs, spokesman for Senate Banking Committee Chairman Paul S.
Sarbanes (D-Md.). ''It's a hope that we get it done by next week. It
is also a stretch that we get it done by next week, but we're
prepared to do that.''</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, meanwhile, are suspicious that Democrats want to drag
out negotiations to keep the issue alive. Citing a Democratic
leader's prediction that it would take two months to reach a
compromise, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer attacked what he
termed a ''Democrat plan to stall this bill.'' He called that
''unacceptable and not in the national interest.''</TE>
<TE>   At issue is legislation many lawmakers say is needed to help
restore investor and consumer confidence in the business community
that has been rocked by a cascade of scandals in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has urged Congress to resolve its differences and send him a
bill to sign before lawmakers go home for a month-long summer recess.
That recess begins at the end of next week for the House, and a week
later for the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill would create an independent board to oversee the
accounting industry, limit the ability of accounting firms to consult
for companies they audit, ban corporate loans to company insiders and
crack down on other business practices that contributed to the
scandals. It also would add new penalties for fraud and make it
easier to prosecute dishonest executives.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill also would create an accounting watchdog panel, but
its makeup and powers would differ from the Senate proposal. The
House bill did not include the stricter penalties for corporate
crime. However, the House on Tuesday passed a separate bill
authorizing increased penalties--going further than the Senate in
some respects and not as far in others.</TE>
<TE>   Oxley struck a more conciliatory tone toward the Senate measure
Wednesday, saying, ''The bills have many similarities, so we begin a
conference based on quite a bit of common ground.''</TE>
<TE>   Republicans defended their decision to call for a formal
conference committee on the bill rather than simply rubber-stamp the
Senate bill.</TE>
<TE>   ''We can take an OK bill and make it really good,'' said Rep.
Richard H. Baker (R-La.).</TE>
<TE>   One major point in dispute is the accounting oversight board.
Under the Senate plan, it would have full authority to set auditing
and ethics rules and to investigate and discipline auditors. The
five-member board would be named by the SEC, with two members, but no
more, having accounting backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill delegates much of the details of the new board's
authority to the SEC, an agency that critics say has not acted
aggressively enough to root out corporate corruption. House
Republicans also have reservations about Senate provisions giving the
board subpoena power, and favor a panel with four of the five members
having an accounting background.</TE>
<TE>   In other issues facing the conference, Oxley and Baker said they
would insist on House provisions to require firms to disclose
information affecting their financial health more rapidly than they
do now.</TE>
<TE>   Baker said he would also insist on a proposal to establish a
mechanism for returning funds to investors who have lost money as a
result of corporate malfeasance.</TE>
<TE>   Conference committee members appointed by the House include five
Californians: Reps. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), William M.
Thomas (R-Bakersfield), Ed Royce (R-Fullerton), George Miller
(D-Martinez) and Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles).</TE>

<HD>Bush's Powers in Security Plan Challenged</HD>
<DH>Defense: Both parties criticize effort to avoid Senate
confirmation of homeland security's assistant secretaries, other
constraints.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush's attempt to design a Department of Homeland Security
unfettered by the usual constraints of Washington bureaucracy is
drawing sharp criticism in Congress from lawmakers leery of an
executive power grab.</LD>
<LD>   Bush wants as many as 10 assistant secretaries in the new
department to be free of the ordinary requirement to undergo Senate
confirmation.</LD>
<LD>   The administration also is seeking the authority to manage the
department's more than 160,000 workers under a ''flexible,
contemporary'' alternative to the federal civil service system.</LD>
<TE>   And it wants the authority to reshuffle significant portions of
the department's budget each year without congressional approval.</TE>
<TE>   Bush contends that the more freedom he is given to hire and fire
employees, buy and sell government property, appoint top executives
and spend or save public money, the better his department will be
able to respond to an unpredictable, fast-moving terrorist threat.</TE>
<TE>   ''Our adversaries are not encumbered by a lot of rules,'' Mitchell
E. Daniels Jr., the White House budget director, told reporters
Wednesday. ''Al Qaeda doesn't have a 3-foot-thick code. This
department is going to need to be nimble.''</TE>
<TE>   While most in Congress profess support for a strong, agile
homeland security agency, senior lawmakers from both parties disagree
sharply with many of Bush's ideas.</TE>
<TE>   The emerging debate indicates that Congress is not just worried
about the size and shape of the new department, but also is
determined to have a strong say in how it would be run.</TE>
<TE>   The administration plan for a Department of Homeland Security
echoes ideas Bush and his aides have advanced to expand executive
powers in the Pentagon and other Cabinet departments after the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks. For instance, Bush has sought large, open-ended
''contingency'' funds to help him make war on terrorists. So far,
Congress has balked at his requests for blank checks.</TE>
<TE>   In creating a homeland security department, Bush--the first
president with an MBA--has found a blank slate to sketch out his own
ideas about management. He has left the proposed 15th Cabinet
department free of much of the red tape that encumbers the other 14.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the president's proposal, if enacted, would mark a
milestone in congressional-executive relations.</TE>
<TE>   ''It reflects a desire to move authority down Pennsylvania Avenue,
from Capitol Hill to the White House,'' said Paul C. Light, a
government scholar at the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan
Washington think tank. Light said he believed Bush's plan to name a
posse of assistant secretaries without Senate approval was ''almost
unprecedented.''</TE>
<TE>   While Bush's call for ''flexibility'' has considerable backing
from congressional Republican leaders, senior lawmakers from both
parties are attacking the plan piece by piece.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), chairman of the Appropriations
Committee and a leading advocate of congressional prerogatives, has
called the Bush plan flawed and is threatening to slow-walk it in the
Senate.</TE>
<TE>   In a hearing Wednesday before a House leadership panel, Rep. David
R. Obey (D-Wis.) denounced administration proposals to allow the new
department freedom to spend money in ways that Congress has not
approved. The Bush bill would allow shifts in funding of up to 5%
from one program to another.</TE>
<TE>   Such transfer of authority is not unprecedented; the departments
of Justice and Defense also have some discretionary spending power.
But a Democratic aide said it would be highly unusual.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that Congress' authority over the federal purse survived
the Civil War and two world wars, Obey said it was ''surprising and
disturbing that the administration would choose to revisit a decision
so central to our constitutional heritage.''</TE>
<TE>   Agreeing with Obey, the Republicans who lead the House
Appropriations Committee last week recommended killing the
administration plan for spending flexibility. House leaders do not
appear inclined to resurrect it.</TE>
<TE>   If anything, many lawmakers want more restrictions on how the
department may spend its money.</TE>
<TE>   The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has
recommended a ceiling on what the Coast Guard can spend on homeland
security if the administration's plan to transfer it to the new
department is approved. The committee says at least 12% of the Coast
Guard's budget should be spent on search and rescue missions, 13% on
illegal drug patrols and 11% on fishery patrols.</TE>
<TE>   Defenders of the administration plan say such detailed curbs would
place a straitjacket on the president's ability to respond to
terrorist threats. But the committee says essential services should
not be cut in the name of fighting terror.</TE>
<TE>   The administration proposal would draw about 164,000 employees
into the department (less than originally envisioned because the
White House has agreed to leave in place about 5,000 Agriculture
Department personnel).</TE>
<TE>   Critics say Bush's proposal for an alternative personnel system
would enable the administration to bypass whistle-blower protection
rules and potentially deny union representation to many workers who
now have it. The administration disputes such criticism.</TE>
<TE>   About 50,000 of the affected employees are represented by unions.
Democrats--and some liberal Republicans--contend that collective
bargaining and other rights should be guaranteed in law for those who
move to homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   The administration insists that current union members have nothing
to fear. But Bush aides say they want a system that will allow the
department to promote strong performers and reject weak ones.</TE>
<TE>   In a hearing this week, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman
of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, told White
House Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge that the Bush bill failed
to protect workers.</TE>
<TE>   ''It is essential that any reorganization respect and protect the
rights of these dedicated federal employees,'' Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) replied: ''I think this department has a
right, and it has a need, to have special labor treatment. We simply
can't afford incompetence.''</TE>
<TE>   The House plans to vote on creating a Homeland Security Department
next week, and the Senate could follow as soon as the following week.</TE>

<HD>Killings of 2 Women Spread Fear Throughout Taos Area</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TAOS, N.M.</DL>
<LD>Authorities said Wednesday that they were seeking a parolee believed
to have stolen a car belonging to one of two women slain in the last
week.</LD>
<LD>   Police said both women lived alone. Prosecutor Donald Gallegos
issued a warning to people in the area, especially single women, to
be extra vigilant.</LD>
<LD>   The slayings have sent fear rippling through this artists' colony
that earlier this month was the site of actress Julia Roberts'
wedding.</LD>
<TE>   State Police Lt. Rob Shilling said the stolen car was found about
140 miles away Wednesday in Albuquerque. He said an arrest warrant
had been issued for Richard Fresquez, a 23-year-old convicted burglar
paroled in May, on suspicion of taking the car and for parole
violation.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they were also looking for a teenage girl seen
with Fresquez.</TE>
<TE>   "We're also anxiously looking for a 16-year-old female," state
police Sgt. Michael F. Trujillo said. "We're concerned for her
well-being."</TE>
<TE>   On July 9, deputies found Marioara Shand, 38, stabbed to death in
her apartment in nearby Ranchos de Taos. The second victim, Leanne
Martinez, 22, was found dead Sunday in her mobile home in Taos. It
was her car that was stolen.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't get my female employees to stay at work past 5 p.m.,"
said Susan Backus, owner of a folk art gift shop. "They don't want to
be out at night. They're afraid they'll get stabbed."</TE>
<TE>   Angelina Vigil, 16, a sales clerk at a T-shirt shop, said she was
raised to not walk anywhere alone at night.</TE>
<TE>   "These events have been scary," she said. "For me, to think that
someone from this town is capable of such acts is unbelievable. The
more I think about it, the more it worries me."</TE>
<TE>   Gift shop manager Bernadine Herrera said it is difficult to
believe such things are happening.</TE>

<HD>Traficant Stays Defiant in Face of Congressional Ethics
Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Confrontational to the end, Rep. James A. Traficant Jr. on Wednesday
accused House ethics panel lawyers of lying, the federal government
of a vendetta and the jury that convicted him of not liking him
because of his attitude.</LD>
<LD>   "I've been railroaded once and I'll be damned if I'll be
railroaded again," Traficant shouted over the pounding gavel of House
Ethics Chairman Joel Hefley (R-Colo.), who tried futilely to get the
Ohio Democrat to calm down.</LD>
<LD>   Traficant, convicted in April by a federal jury of bribery, tax
evasion and racketeering, concluded his defense against House ethics
violations with rants against people he accused of aligning
themselves against him.</LD>
<TE>   He complained bitterly to the eight-member panel about an FBI
vendetta. "You're looking at the No. 1 target of the Justice
Department, and I hate those bastards, and I think that America's
starting to hate them too," Traficant said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers are deciding whether Traficant is guilty of accusations
that he engaged in a "continuing pattern and practice of official
misconduct" connected to the charges that he was found guilty of
after a trial in Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   If the committee finds that he violated House rules, lawmakers
would decide at a separate hearing whether to recommend that
Traficant become the second congressman since the Civil War to be
expelled from Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant said he plans on dressing in a denim suit and doing a
"Michael Jackson moonwalk" on the House floor when it comes time to
defend himself in front of the full 435-member House.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant, 61, who has been abrasive to committee lawyers and
panel members throughout the hearing, has indicated he expects to be
found guilty again.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have recommended he serve at least seven years in
prison. Sentencing is scheduled for July 30.</TE>

<DL>CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit that accused Tyson Foods Inc.
of depressing wages by hiring illegal immigrants at its plant in
Shelbyville.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling does not affect a pending federal case in which the
nation's largest meat processing company is accused of conspiring to
smuggle immigrants into the country to work at Tyson plants.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit dismissed Tuesday said Tyson used a scheme involving
temporary employment agencies that persuaded illegal immigrants to
work for the company.</LD>
<TE>   The plaintiffs, four former hourly employees at Tyson's
Shelbyville plant, planned to appeal, said their attorney Howard
Foster.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Worker for Smarts Indicted in Bank Heist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>A former handyman who worked in the home of Elizabeth A. Smart was
indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury on bank robbery charges.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Ricci, who police say is a possible suspect in the
gunpoint abduction of the 14-year-old from her bedroom early June 5,
is accused of being a masked gunman who robbed a bank on Nov. 2,
2001.</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday's charges are not associated with the girl's
disappearance, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   Ricci, 48, and two others are accused of stealing $1,713 from the
Far West Bank in Sandy, Utah. A 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol was
used in the crime, authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   Under the indictment, all three men face possible sentences of up
to 10 years in federal prison for being felons in possession of
firearms. The robbery charges carry a penalty of up to 25 years in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Because Ricci has been convicted of violent felonies twice before,
prosecutors say they will seek a mandatory life sentence under the
federal three-strikes law.</TE>
<TE>   Ricci has denied any involvement in the girl's kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   Ricci's attorney, David K. Smith, noted in a statement that the
indictment "has nothing to do with the disappearance of Elizabeth
Smart."</TE>
<TE>   Ricci was charged in state court last week with allegedly stealing
$3,500 in items from the Smart home and about $300 in cash from
another home in the neighborhood last year. He worked as a handyman
for both families, police said.</TE>

<HD>A Fearful Duality: American and Iranian</HD>
<DH>I can no longer count on a U.S. passport to bail me out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TARA BAHRAMPOUR</AU>
<BD>Tara Bahrampour is the author of "To See and See Again:
A Life in Iran and America" (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1999).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Iran's civil liberties tug of war has been going on since the early
days of the Islamic Republic, and despite improvements after the
election of a reformist president five years ago, banning an
entertainer from performing in public is not unusual.</LD>
<LD>   So when I read that Mohamad Khordadian--described as Iran's
best-known male dancer--had been convicted of promoting corruption
among young people and forbidden to leave Iran for 10 years or give
dance classes for the rest of his life, I barely gave it a thought.
And then I learned that Khordadian, an L.A. resident, had traveled to
Iran on a U.S. passport. And that the charges of his "corruption" of
young people were based on his activities in the U.S., where he has
lived for the last two decades.</LD>
<LD>   A surprising element of this story was that he was traveling on
his U.S. passport. That's unusual for Iranian Americans. Most of us
are considered Iranian by the Iranian government and are required to
travel accordingly.</LD>
<TE>   This is our dance: We leave the U.S. or Europe or wherever as
Americans; we make the necessary flight transfers as Americans until
the boarding call for the last leg of the journey. Then, the blue
passport with the gold-embossed eagle disappears into the money belt
and the maroon passport with the gold-embossed "Allah" comes out. We
land in Iran. If we are women, we will have pulled scarves and coats
over our jeans and T-shirts before disembarking and showing our
passports to the authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Often, those of us with dual citizenship arrive with no stamps in
our Iranian passports other than the last exit visa from Iran. "Where
have you been these three years since you flew out," they might ask,
"hovering in the air this whole time?" But they don't ask. And we
don't offer. They seem to accept our duality.</TE>
<TE>   Once we're in, our American passports stay tucked in drawers in
our relatives' homes while we roam the streets, Iranians in Iran,
free from the watchful eye often cast upon American visitors, but
subject to the laws of a country that has no diplomatic relations
with the United States. And yet there is that secret, precious paper
in the drawer; that document, coveted by so many throughout the Third
World, that will open the door on our return to the outside world.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing I ever actually used my U.S. passport for in Iran
was to gain entry into the British Embassy, which has an
English-language library that the few Americans living there can use.
I arrived to see an unmoving line of Iranians who had been standing
on the sidewalk since dawn, waiting to apply for British visas. I
sailed to the front of the line and into the office. Sure, I was
Iranian, but I was something else too.</TE>
<TE>   But what would happen if I got into trouble there? Consider the
nature of Khordadian's crime: He taught young people in the U.S. to
dance. How many Iranian Americans living in the U.S. could fall into
a similar criminal category? What of the Iranian-born art teacher who
uses nude models in his classes at an American university? Granted,
Khordadian is well-known in Iran, and his problem arose when
videotapes and satellite broadcasts of his classes found their way
there. Still, if Khordadian can get in trouble for his activities in
California, then could all of us be in danger for behaving like
Americans in America?</TE>
<TE>   And if we got stuck? In the absence of an American presence, the
Swiss Embassy handles U.S. interests in Iran, and that idea, vague as
it sounds, has reassured scores of us that we would have some
recourse. We imagine we would be considered U.S. citizens trapped in
Iran, with all that implies. My passport, if not a "get out of jail
free" card, was like the gift from the giant Simorgh bird of Persian
mythology--a feather I could burn when I needed the eagle to swoop in
and rescue me.</TE>
<TE>   In reality, there is not much the U.S. can do for its millions of
dual citizens when they are in their second country, especially if
that country has no diplomatic relations with the U.S. "He's in Iran.
He's subject to Iranian law," said Edward Dickens, a consular advisor
at the State Department. "If Iranian law is weird, it's too bad."</TE>
<TE>   Khordadian's situation is not unusual, he added. "It happens in
China, in Saudi Arabia; it happens all over the world. Especially in
places where sometimes these dual nationals disagree with the
politics of the country."</TE>
<TE>   Coming back to the U.S. from Iran, I have never been questioned at
the airport. Unlike many whose accents and features give them away, I
look and sound more like my Californian-born mother than my Middle
Eastern father. So I'm not worried about the U.S. side.</TE>
<TE>   But on my next visit to Iran, I will not sail in quite so perkily.
Whatever eventually comes of Khordadian's case, I and others like me
will arrive carrying a new prick of fear: that it is easier to get
lost in this world than we knew, that simply being American is not
necessarily enough to save us.</TE>

<BD>Gar Anthony Haywood's next crime novel, "Man-Eater," is
due in January from Penguin Putnam. E-mail: garhaywood@earthlink.net.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Allen Iverson, the Philadelphia 76ers' talented yet troublesome
superstar guard, surrendered to West Philadelphia authorities
Tuesday, a familiar debate was heating up on the national talk- radio
landscape: Is it racist to call a young black man from the 'hood a
thug if his behavior seems to warrant it?</LD>
<LD>   My answer would be no. But that doesn't mean the vigor with which
the "thug" accusation is sometimes made doesn't rankle me.</LD>
<LD>   As probably most know by now, Iverson is accused of forcing his
way into a West Philadelphia apartment July 3 in search of his wife,
then threatening its two male occupants with an unregistered handgun.</LD>
<TE>   Cornrow-headed and thickly tattooed, Iverson--a product of the
mean streets of Newport News, Va., and openly proud of it--has the
look, the attitude and the growing list of troubles with the law
necessary to make him a model for the thug life.</TE>
<TE>   How, his detractors want to know, can anyone, black or white,
muster the nerve to deny anyone the right to call so obvious a punk a
punk?</TE>
<TE>   Here's how: A lot of us are sickened by the zeal with which
Iverson and the like (yes, even O.J. was an example) are nailed to
the cross. No matter how guilty of a crime the accused might turn out
to be, a lynching is still a lynching.</TE>
<TE>   Criticizing a man in the open court of public opinion is one
thing, but virtually hanging him in the town square without a trial
is quite another.</TE>
<TE>   Generations of unenviable experiences have taught us African
Americans how to recognize the difference.</TE>
<TE>   When talk-show hosts and media commentators take to the task of
attacking a black individual accused of a crime--even something as
alarming as that which Iverson may indeed have committed--with a
vitriol that should be reserved for white-collar sociopaths like
Enron's Kenneth Lay and WorldCom's Bernard J. Ebbers, whose misdeeds
affect the lives and futures of millions, no one should be surprised
when black people either rush to the defense of the accused or refuse
to add their voices to that of the mob calling for his head.</TE>
<TE>   Should Iverson's life growing up on the battlefields of Newport
News have any bearing on the kind of man he is today?</TE>
<TE>   To his harshest critics, the answer is a simple and emphatic no.
They believe that once Iverson made the National Basketball Assn.
big-time, he should have shed the physical and psychological
trappings of his past experiences like an old coat. After all, who
needs a killer attitude and homies from the 'hood when nobody's
holding a gun to your head anymore?</TE>
<TE>   But whereas I and many other black Americans would concur that
Iverson's street mentality has no intrinsic value in his role as a
sports icon, we also understand that the matter of "keeping it
real"--which is to say, following a code of behavior one's very life
has literally depended on for years--is not so easily discarded. Or,
at the very least, it should not be treated as a nonissue in the
discussion of Iverson's inability (or reluctance) to straighten out
his act.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, none of these explanations for the refusal of some in
the African American community to take part in Iverson's on-air
persecution mean anything to his most vociferous assailants. Iverson
is a monster in their book, and anyone who would dare even request
that they put down their torches and terminate their march upon
"Iverson Castle" is only an apologist for him.</TE>
<TE>   They miss the point.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson's defenders aren't really debating his qualifications as a
thug as much as they are asking his eager-beaver, would-be
executioners a simple question: Aren't there bigger monsters in the
world more deserving of such unbridled passion?</TE>

<HD>A Foster-Care Tragedy Worthy of Dickens</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEW HOLLMAN</AU>
<BD>Lew Hollman is executive director of the Center for Law
in the Public Interest. The litigation referred to in this article is
being brought by the center; the ACLU Foundation of Southern
California; Heller Ehrman White &amp; McCauliffe; the Western Center of
Law and Poverty; Protection &amp; Advocacy, a law firm; Bazelon Center
for Mental Health in Washington, D.C.; and the Youth Law Center of
San Francisco.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles has a foster-care system driven by what is available, not
what is needed. Children receive too few services too late. Thousands
are shuttled to ineffective and expensive institutional care. They
are poorly monitored, with no consistent, individualized care. Not
surprisingly, many deteriorate in county care, populating our jails,
homeless shelters and mental wards after they "age out" of a failed
system. Many never overcome the effects of the abuse or neglect they
have suffered.</LD>
<LD>   At a time when funds for children's services are ever more scarce,
we are paying more for less in terms of healthy outcomes. Millions of
federal dollars are at risk because of our inability to meet
reasonable guidelines for stable placements--through family
reunification, adoption or long-term foster care. More important, the
children whom the system is intended to protect are being irreparably
harmed.</LD>
<LD>   This is not a problem that can be solved simply by changing the
person at the top, as L.A. County has done twice in recent years. It
requires a philosophical change at all levels--from a system based on
what services are available to a system based on earlier intervention
and individualized needs.</LD>
<TE>   A suit will be filed today on behalf of foster children put at
risk by a failed system. It will demand a wider array of mental
health services available under Medi-Cal; multidisciplinary
assessments of the needs of each child based on all relevant
information; continuity in services and plans for each child; and the
development of services and providers to ensure that no child will be
rejected.</TE>
<TE>   MacLaren Children's Center in El Monte, the county's emergency
shelter for abused and neglected children, is an apt symbol of our
failed system. Designated a short-term shelter, it has become instead
the county's warehouse for the unwanted. Once a home for wayward
girls, it retains its foreboding atmosphere. Such control as
exists--in many instances, poor management has led to children being
abused, often by other residents--is prison-like.</TE>
<TE>   Some MacLaren residents languish for months beyond the ostensible
30-day limit. Many more are constantly "recycled" as foster homes
reject them, adding to the trauma that brought the children to the
county's care. One plaintiff, removed from her home as a result of
sexual and physical abuse by her stepfather, was moved by the county
28 times between the ages of 9 and 13. Another is in a locked
facility because of the healthy impulse to find a better life
elsewhere. In less than three years, she was moved 25 times.</TE>
<TE>   When Dickensian stories like these are related to the uninformed,
they are greeted with incredulity. It is often assumed that lack of
resources must be the problem. Of course, no one desires these
rootless sojourns through impersonal care. And our society could, no
doubt, better invest in the needs of its children. But lack of money
is not at the root of these problems.</TE>
<TE>   Inertia and lack of accountability are the culprits. The county
has become increasingly defensive about releasing cost estimates.</TE>
<TE>   According to a recently released Los Angeles Grand Jury report,
however, costs during the 2001-2002 fiscal year at MacLaren
approximated $757 per day for each child--more than $276,000 per
year. Group-care facilities, recognized as contrary to the interests
of most children, were estimated to cost about $33,000 annually per
child five years ago. By contrast, children at risk who can be
assisted without removal from the home cost less than $5,000 a year,
and foster home and kinship placements less than $10,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Medi-Cal, through the early and periodic screening, diagnosis and
treatment program and other federal programs, can pay for many of the
intensive services that children need. True case management would
ensure the effective use of such services to enable children to
remain in--or quickly return to--their homes, be freed for adoption
or settled in long-term foster care.</TE>
<TE>   The county recognizes the penny-wise, pound-foolish nature of the
system. In addition to grand jury reports, state audits, independent
evaluations and testimony before the Board of Supervisors, it brought
its own expert in to evaluate and make recommendations in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Robert F. Cole, an independent expert nationally recognized
for his work with disturbed children, centered his recommendations on
an "integrated delivery system," such as "wrap-around" care, that
would coordinate services and deliver them in a family-like
environment, or the child's home, whenever possible.</TE>
<TE>   A successfully tested method, the wrap-around concept is used in
other counties in California and in other states, where it has
reduced cost and improved the outcomes of children in foster care.
The goal is for caseworkers, therapists, health providers and schools
to work together to ensure children prompt and stable placements and
the early development of a long-term plan to see children reunited
with their families, adopted or placed in long-term foster care.</TE>
<TE>   Two years after his initial report, Cole praised the county for
being poised to implement coordinated services for foster children.
But in that time, the county had contracted with only two providers
for wrap-around care, serving two children each. Although additional
foster care providers have been found since 2000, wrap-around care
and other types of intensive care are virtually unavailable in a
system providing services to more than 50,000 children a year, with
slightly less than 38,000 in county custody. Half of those in custody
are estimated to have serious emotional problems. Those problems will
become increasingly difficult and expensive to treat if effective
care is not provided.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court has held that due process under the
Constitution requires the government to protect from harm any child
it takes into its custody.</TE>
<TE>   The Constitution is violated when children deteriorate in county
care or are subjected to policies--such as 25 different placements in
less than three years--that no disinterested professional would
countenance. Federal Medicaid laws are broken when needed medical
services for children are not provided.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit to be filed today will ask the court to cut the knot
of inertia and hold accountable the county and the state officials
responsible for oversight.</TE>

<LD>Wars uproot families, villages, even cities, spilling their people
across borders to live in crowded encampments threatened by epidemics
and violence. For decades, hundreds of thousands of Afghans fleeing
Soviet invaders and later the Taliban endured miserable conditions in
Pakistan near the border of their homeland. Many more waited as
unwelcome guests in Iran for the day they could go home. That day has
come for far more refugees than expected.</LD>
<LD>   Feeding and housing the returnees has overtaxed the new Afghan
government. The countries that promised so much aid so many months
ago need to pay up.</LD>
<LD>   In the last four months, more than 1.2 million refugees have
returned from neighboring countries to Afghanistan, nearly triple the
number originally expected. The Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees calls it one of the largest and fastest
voluntary migrations in history. Hundreds of thousands more are
expected before the snow falls. Then there are the hundreds of
thousands who found shelter elsewhere in the country but want to get
home, moving from Kandahar to Mazar-i-Sharif or Spin Buldak to
Jalalabad.</LD>
<TE>   The influx has forced the U.N. refugee agency to cut back on
provisions. A family of six entitled to 330 pounds of wheat a month
ago now gets 220 pounds. Blankets and tarpaulins are gone, so
families receive only plastic sheeting. Donors had promised the U.N.
agency $271 million for refugee assistance. More than $50 million
that was pledged has yet to arrive, and far more is needed for the
unanticipated influx.</TE>
<TE>   The government's reconstruction minister says that of the $1.8
billion in foreign aid pledged overall, Afghanistan has received only
$300 million. The United States, Japan and Germany have provided the
most, but the minister says even they have not delivered all they
promised. So civil servants are paid late or not at all, irrigation
systems are not installed and shelters are not built.</TE>
<TE>   Governments that planned to spread out the aid over the year
should see whether they can deliver it sooner. And Washington should
start reminding other nations of their commitments and Afghanistan's
need.</TE>
<TE>   Washington also could entice donors by agreeing to expand the
international peacekeeping force beyond Kabul, as is sought by
Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan. Many private aid organizations say they can't provide security
for their workers in territories still controlled by warlords. Until
the workers and refugees feel safe, crops won't be planted and houses
won't be built.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly half the returned refugees have stayed in Kabul, straining
the capital's thin resources, because there are no jobs in their
villages.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan's finance minister appealed this week for swift
international help to cover a budget deficit of nearly $260 million.
The country needs much more assistance. Above all, it needs not to be
ignored, as it was in the international community after the Soviets
were driven out more than a dozen years ago.</TE>

<LD>One minute little Samantha Runnion is playing a board game with a
fellow 5-year-old near her Orange County condominium. The next a lone
man snatches her into his car. The following sunny summer afternoon
Samantha is found dead. And a stunned nation stares, appalled.</LD>
<LD>   Child abductions by nonrelatives are rare. But they're still every
parent's nightmare. Who hasn't warned his or her child of strangers,
told the child to run or scream? What shopper hasn't, for one
heart-stopping moment, turned to find the child not in sight, before
quickly discovering him or her hiding in a clothes rack or pulling
magazines off a nearby shelf? And then, out of desperate fear and
relief, delivered a stern scolding?</LD>
<LD>   Samantha's mother, Erin, seems to have done everything possible to
protect her daughter. She described practicing an abduction with
Samantha screaming for help. Samantha was smart, like the Peter Pan
on her bedroom wall. She did scream as she was carried away to an
unthinkable Never-Never Land. She kicked too. But she didn't have the
strength of the heroic Hercules, who also adorned her wall.</LD>
<TE>   The Runnions had moved to a safer, partly enclosed neighborhood.
Erin Runnion is a working mom, so Grandma was caring for Samantha by
day. What "if onlys" will run through those two mothers' anguished
minds for years to come about what they might have, should have,
could have done. In all of their anguish, they must remember that
it's the killer who deserves blame.</TE>
<TE>   Police suggest that Samantha's abductor will strike again,
probably at another little person. Presumably others like him wander
this land. Cannot this nation able to detect a warm engine from space
or an invisible planet from Earth devise some way to profile such a
predator before a child's life is lost? Did a relative, friend or
neighbor see the culprit's disturbing proclivities?</TE>
<TE>   And how close can we hold, protect, even clutch our most precious
possessions and still grant them the joys of childhood? To play. To
pretend. To fly high on swings. To watch silently as chocolate ice
cream dissolves over clothing and car seat. To explore. In short, to
grow up in wondrous ways before our admiring, amazed eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha was a curly-haired little girl who was going to get a 3-D
dinosaur puzzle, Legos and new Barbie dresses for her birthday next
week. This killer prevented her from resuming her ballet lessons.
Now, he's preventing countless other children from playing outside.
What are we going to do as individuals and a society to thwart future
predators? For now, there is one thing we can do, through law
enforcement: Hunt him down. And quickly.</TE>

<LD>The Irish Republican Army's long campaign against British rule in
Northern Ireland killed civilians carelessly if not deliberately. It
was certainly a walk along a path that could have led to hate-filled
suicide bombers. The IRA, however, took a significant step in the
right direction this week with its "sincere apologies and
condolences" to civilian victims and their families. It was a
much-needed moment of optimism for peace.</LD>
<LD>   Several years ago, the leader of the IRA's political wing, Gerry
Adams, apologized for one act, the 1987 Enniskillen bombing that
killed 11 people, but the new apology is the IRA's first broad
statement of remorse.</LD>
<LD>   The timing was significant, five days before the anniversary of
Bloody Friday, an infamous day in 1972 when the IRA detonated dozens
of bombs, killing nine people and injuring hundreds. The death toll
on both sides during the decades of strife is about 3,600.</LD>
<TE>   Some critics took issue with the scope of the IRA apology, which
included only noncombatants, contending that it should have been
broader. Many unionists dismissed the IRA statement as too little,
too late.</TE>
<TE>   It is true that the IRA has more to do. It has begun
decommissioning weapons and should continue, at a faster pace. The
IRA leadership also should come clean regarding its links to the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the narco-terrorist
guerrillas. It has yet to explain what three IRA operatives jailed in
Colombia were doing in guerrilla-controlled territory.</TE>
<TE>   In this week's statement, however, the IRA's words seem
unequivocal: "We remain totally committed to the peace process and to
dealing with the challenges and difficulties which this presents." We
hope it precedes equally forthright deeds of peace and healing.</TE>

<LD>Re "Stop Drift in Child Services," editorial, July 12: Your editorial
was on target. Our county's foster youth have been failed. However,
you ignored three vital priorities: fast-tracking the adoption
process, providing desperately needed assistance for emancipated
youth and fixing a dangerously inadequate child-abuse hotline.
Guidelines and objectives for the Department of Children and Family
Services are well established, and the Board of Supervisors has been
persistent in enunciating these expectations to the department.</LD>
<LD>   The county child support office has been turned around by a
capable director who takes a hands-on approach to problem-solving and
is responsive to clients and the Board of Supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   The DCFS' new director must also be a strong leader with
management skills, dedicated to following through on defined plans to
meet the needs of our young people, who require stable homes and
loving families.</LD>

<LD>Re Joe Cornish's July 13 letter, "Where Lofty Living Meets Downtown
L.A.": Oh, Mr. Cornish, please! You make loft living sound like a
stint in the Crusades with your term "weak at heart," referring to
those tenants who were fed up with conditions. My daughter and her
friend are anything but; they were prepared for the whole gritty
urban scene and loved the area. I visited and stayed with them and
loved the area too.</LD>
<LD>   What they and I did not like were the conditions at the Hellman
Building (first four letters only too appropriate). A roof fire,
chunks of the ceiling falling down, etc. We all are anxious to see
downtown succeed; more preparation is first needed for some of these
buildings to become safe.</LD>

<HD>Sympathetic Portrait of Hesham Hadayet</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What was "Those Who Knew LAX Killer Say Personal Agenda Died With
Him," your July 14 article about Hesham Hadayet? A eulogy to a
murderer? Does his "American dream" story vindicate his vicious act?
How about memorializing the victims and condemning the perpetrator of
an obvious hate crime and terrorist act? That would be the obvious
thing to do. In the article, the widow and family of Hadayet are
portrayed as the victims. I feel insulted for the families of the
real victims, Yaakov Aminov and Victoria Hen.</LD>
<LD>   Alita Z. Arnold</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your article on Hadayet, the airport murderer, is quite
mind-boggling--a sensitive bio on an obvious mass-murderer wannabe, a
racist and a wife-beater. Why did the article omit Hadayet's hatred
of the American flag after Sept. 11 and his hostility toward his
neighbor who was in the American military? Why did the article not
mention Hadayet's suspected ties to the Egyptian Islamic Jihad?</TE>
<TE>   I can't wait to see your portrait of journalist Daniel Pearl's
murderers. I am sure it will be a tear-jerker.</TE>

<TE>   Hadayet's widow has said that "there is nothing to suggest he was
a bad person." I offer the following reason why Hadayet was, in fact,
a bad person: He murdered two innocent civilians in a terrorist
attack at LAX.</TE>

<LD>Re "Simon's Success Story Is a Secret," July 13: I don't vote for
stealth candidates. Either Bill Simon does what Gov. Gray Davis and

<HD>With the Deficit Rising, Confidence Is Falling</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Markets Nearing Crucial Stage," July 14: Almost exactly a year
ago, President Bush's administration was loudly proclaiming that the
economic forces and political decisions leading to the
then-accelerating financial slowdown were rooted in the prior
presidency and thus could not be deemed to have occurred "on his
watch."</LD>
<LD>   But then, in that case, may I ask on whose watch were the policies
enacted--and continued for the ensuing year--to cut taxes, deplete
the treasury by giving back prior collections and commence borrowing
cash to do it, all instead of conservatively saving it for a national
rainy day?</LD>
<LD>   We have catastrophically frittered away a balanced budget along
with a historic surplus, and the buck stops at the Oval Office.</LD>
<TE>   David R. Ginsburg</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is patriotic and necessary that we support the "war on
terrorism." Whatever happened to the necessity of protecting the
national interest provided by the voice of the "loyal opposition"?
The president has been given a free pass.</TE>
<TE>   As the memory of my $600 tax rebate is nearly gone, I look in
horror at the rising federal deficit and the corporate tax cuts for
the rich who are driving it. As my retirement fund dwindles, I listen
to the president asking for stiffer penalties for corporate crooks
for doing the same things that he and Vice President Dick Cheney did,
without suggesting controls to stop the practices. Catch us if you
can, put us in jail and let us keep the money.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the easing of rules on the environment and allowing
big business to control pollution on a voluntary basis is akin to
letting the fox guard the henhouse. Hiding behind executive privilege
to protect the collusion of government and utility executives that
were used to formulate energy policy is appalling.</TE>
<TE>   The Democrats share the blame equally by looking at poll numbers
and failing to express any outrage over these policies. It is one
thing to be patriotic and another to ignore governing and the needs
of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Friedman</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Egregious corporate income tax dodges no doubt will exceed the
$165-billion deficit anticipated for this year by the White House.
These deficit dollars, with interest, will ultimately have to come
out of other pockets. Guess whose.</TE>

<HD>The Salton Sea Can, and Should, Be Saved</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two sentences into "Drop Bid to Revive the Dying Salton Sea" (by
Brent M. Haddad and Christopher J. Brown, Commentary, July 14) and I
was upset. By the end of the article I was incensed. That "there is
virtually nothing that can stop that" [the death of the Salton Sea]
is patently wrong. For there is a solution. And it is win/win/win.</LD>
<LD>   Bring water from the Sea of Cortez. It is less salty than the
Salton Sea. It is at sea level. The Salton Sea is more than 200 feet
below sea level. Win for the sea, for the birds, for recreation, for
jobs (anyone care about jobs anymore?), for the environment and for
Baja California. Areas to the north of the Sea of Cortez are dying
also because its northern feed has been taken by California farmers.
By sending the water north, the Sea of Cortez gets a flow (and its
fishing industry revived). With gravity on our side, the Pacific then
refills the Sea of Cortez and everyone has a better life.</LD>
<LD>   Or we could just let the sea die, the birds try to find their new
home--as the authors suggest--before they die and the residents of
Southern California try to stop the acid windstorms off the dead
seabed before we die. But why would the authors care? They are in
Santa Cruz.</LD>

<HD>Seeing the Big Picture In Mitchell Crooks' Video</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All the outcry by public officials and others over the arrest of
Mitchell Crooks, following his videotaping of the police-beating
incident in Inglewood, is curious for one reason ("National Activists
Decry Inglewood Incident," July 15). The crimes for which he was
arrested (and which have yet to be proved in court) have nothing to
do with the videotaping. What the videotaping did was merely raise
Crooks' profile.</LD>
<LD>   If the crimes he allegedly committed did not exist, there would be
nothing to arrest him for. Those who are "outraged" by the arrest and
who are raising money to help in Crooks' legal defense would do well
to bear this in mind.</LD>
<LD>   Dennis Hanrahan</LD>
<TE>   La Habra</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I think it is interesting, if not bizarre, that Rep. Maxine Waters
(D-Los Angeles) considers burglary and hit-and-run to be "minor
offenses" ("$10,000 Is Sought for Defense of Man Who Videotaped
Beating," July 14). Minor to whom? I would ask. I am sure this has to
be very discomforting to her constituents, some of whom have been
victims of these crimes, as well as to our L.A. city officials who
have been decrying the heinous nature of just such crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Robert E. Wilson</TE>
<TE>   West Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How often do cops get bloodied--even a little--on the job? Not
often. So when Officer Jeremy Morse is seen bleeding on the
now-infamous videotape, you know he's not going to be pleased. Cops
are human, and no amount of silly "sensitivity training" will ever
change that fact. When Morse punched Donovan Jackson after he was
handcuffed, yes, that was probably going over the line. But I
wouldn't define it as "brutality." Especially considering that we
don't really know the exact events leading up to this incident.</TE>
<TE>   But at the very least, we know that Morse's ear is cut and
bleeding. Jackson caused this. Then he got handcuffed and punched one
time too many. Is that not a fair assessment? Morse shouldn't be
fired. And he won't be. He should be suspended for a while, maybe, as
he is now. But no more, no less. Once again, a piece of videotape is
hideously blown out of proportion.</TE>

<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If the officers are guilty of excessive force in the arrest, this
does not make the young man they arrested innocent. The excessive
actions of Jackson caused the police to react as they did. It would
seem that both parties should be held accountable.</TE>

<HD>Bees Kill Dog, Sting Man, Daughter</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A swarm of bees attacked a Whittier man and his daughter Wednesday,
killed their dog and sent children at a nearby elementary school
fleeing into their classrooms, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The bees, which fire officials said may have been Africanized
honeybees, flew into the 6000 block of Pickering Avenue about 1 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   The man and his 12-year-old daughter were outside their home when
they were each stung a few times. They suffered no serious injuries,
but their Chihuahua was killed, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   At Lincoln Elementary School, children were confined to their
classrooms, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said they believed the bees had a hive in the family's
attic or garage.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Mussen of the Department of Entomology at UC Davis said
genetic tests could determine if the bees were Africanized, but that
Africanized insects are present in Southern California. "It's not the
first canine death," he said. "It won't be the last."</TE>

<HD>Charles Burton, 59; Circumnavigated Globe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles Burton, a British explorer who took part in the first
expedition to circumnavigate the world from pole to pole, has died.
He was 59.</LD>
<LD>   Burton, who survived life-threatening encounters with a polar
bear, an ice floe, glaciers and a fire during the expedition, died
Monday of a heart attack at his home in Framfield in southeast
England, his family said.</LD>
<LD>   Burton was in a small group that sailed down the River Thames from
London on Sept. 2, 1979, to begin a three-year journey that followed
the imaginary meridian line that connects the Royal Observatory in
Greenwich, where longitude and Greenwich Mean Time are calculated, to
the North and South poles.</LD>
<TE>   The Transglobe Expedition group--which also included leader Sir
Ranulph Fiennes; former brewery salesman Oliver Shepard; Fiennes'
wife, Ginnie; and their family terrier Bothy--was described by patron
Prince Charles as "refreshingly mad."</TE>
<TE>   The adventure lived up to its billing as the "toughest journey on
earth" when the group was attacked by a polar bear, stranded on a
glacier when its snow vehicles caught fire, marooned for three months
on a drifting ice floe, and severely burned by the sun when trudging
through the desert.</TE>
<TE>   From London, the explorers headed south through Europe, across the
Mediterranean and the Sahara to Cape Town, South Africa, where they
picked up a boat to reach Antarctica.</TE>
<TE>   After several months living in a cardboard hut and engaging in
scientific research, the three men set off on the 900-mile trek to
the pole, leaving Lady Fiennes behind to maintain radio contact.</TE>
<TE>   The first leg was relatively smooth, despite Burton falling down a
crevasse. The group became only the third from Britain--after Robert
Scott in 1912 and Sir Vivian Fuchs in 1958--to reach the South Pole
when they arrived Dec. 15, 1980.</TE>
<TE>   As they turned north, Shepard dropped out for personal reasons and
Burton used a short stop in Sydney, Australia, to marry his fiancee,
Thelma Petts.</TE>
<TE>   Burton, Fiennes and his wife then sailed across the Pacific and up
the west coast of North America, negotiating the Yukon and Mackenzie
rivers to enter Canada's Northwest Territories. There, the two men
again left Lady Fiennes behind to set up a base camp.</TE>
<TE>   It was on the northbound leg that the pair ran into their greatest
difficulties. As they raced both French and Norwegian parties to the
North Pole, a fire destroyed much of their supplies and, on one
occasion, Burton hung onto Fiennes' snowmobile with frozen hands as
it sank into open seawater while his companion rescued some vital
pieces of equipment.</TE>
<TE>   They eventually arrived at the North Pole, celebrating their
success ahead of the Norwegians and French with "a nicely chilled
magnum."</TE>
<TE>   But in their frantic bid to make the Spitzbergen Island before the
Arctic ice melted, they became stranded on an ice floe and were
forced to shoot a polar bear when it decided to join them.</TE>
<TE>   After drifting for three months, they met their ship and made it
back to Greenwich on Aug. 29, 1982--ending a 52,000-mile journey.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a commander in the Royal Navy, Burton was born in Cape
Town, South Africa, and went to Millfield, a boarding school, before
joining the army, serving with the elite Special Air Service.</TE>
<TE>   Burton is survived by his wife.</TE>

<HD>As His Campaign Flounders, Simon Seems Lost at Sea</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Bill Simon Jr. must feel like skipper Billy Tyne in "The Perfect
Storm," being attered by an unlikely convergence of climatic events.</LD>
<LD>   Bill, like Billy, steered right into the center of this storm
himself, unawares.</LD>
<LD>   The Republican candidate's dilemma:</LD>
<TE>   * Simon is running for governor as a rich businessman-investor at
a time when there seems to be a new revelation daily about some
corrupt CEO. For many voters, polls indicate, rich businessman is
synonymous with corporate greed.</TE>
<TE>   * The electorate isn't exactly singing the praises of corporate
America anyway because a majority of voters, I suspect, have been
watching their 401k retirement savings seriously erode.</TE>
<TE>   * Simon has refused to release his income tax returns, despite the
fact that practically every big-time politician does. He might have
gotten away with this, except the Internal Revenue Service now claims
he has used a tax shelter that may be illegal and certainly is
"abusive." A voter's logical question: What else is he hiding?</TE>
<TE>   * Since Simon has no experience in elective office, he must tout
the management and leadership skills he has shown in business. But he
refuses to back up his claims of success with facts about return
rates on investments. "They're private," he told Times reporter
Michael Finnegan.</TE>
<TE>   * Gov. Gray Davis had $31.6 million stashed in his political kitty
as of June 30, an enormous sum. His campaign proudly announced this
on Tuesday as Simon was speaking to the Sacramento Press Club. Why?
Simon was bound to get a lot of attention and Davis wanted to horn
in--to send a message to potential Simon donors that he'd be an
underfinanced, losing investment. Simon reportedly had only $5
million in cash.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Billy Tyne, Bill Simon is not a skilled skipper. He has
never been in rough water before. Indeed, before this voyage, Simon
had never been in any political water.</TE>
<TE>   Listening to him for an hour at the Press Club, I got the
impression Simon was in way over his head and probably should have
stayed on the dock.</TE>
<TE>   In the long run, a better course might have been to follow his
initial instinct and run for state treasurer or some other lower
office. But consultant Sal Russo convinced him that his best shot was
governor because Davis was vulnerable and without a strong GOP
gubernatorial candidate, Simon couldn't win a smaller office anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Simon did win the gubernatorial nomination, but by default. Former
L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan imploded while being ripped apart by Davis
attack ads. Secretary of State Bill Jones couldn't raise money.</TE>
<TE>   Simon outflanked his two GOP rivals on the right and now is
awkwardly trying to move toward the center, especially on abortion
and the environment.</TE>
<TE>   But the main reason Simon seems the wrong candidate for the wrong
office is not just because he's a "proud conservative" who's
"pro-life." Or that he's a businessman when many voters are
anti-business. Or totally lacking in any state government experience.
Or hasn't even always bothered to vote.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is his predicament mainly caused by a bloated staff constantly
being reshuffled, usually at the behest of presidential and national
GOP strategists.</TE>
<TE>   No, Simon's core problem is that he doesn't convey commitment or
conviction. Doesn't exude emotion or create excitement. He smiles,
but doesn't emit warmth.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Reagan did all that. Former Gov. George Deukmejian was
boring, but he had a long, solid record and left no doubt he'd lock
up the bad guys. Pete Wilson wasn't exciting, but he projected strong
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Simon beats up on Davis--"the first coin-operated governor"--and
he should. Davis is a sitting duck with a tarnished image. He leads
Simon by only seven points--41% to 34%--in the latest Field poll.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now people would prefer a change, but they're not going to
buy a pig in a poke," says Allan Hoffenblum, a longtime Republican
pro. "They may dislike Gray, but they don't fear him."</TE>
<TE>   "There's still plenty of time to elect the guy," GOP strategist
Ken Khachigian says of Simon. "But he ought to spend a couple of
quality weeks just thinking about where he's going. Getting his
bearings."</TE>
<TE>   Not being Gray Davis won't be enough. Voters will want to know who
Bill Simon is and whether he's an acceptable alternative. What will
he do for them? Tell them one or two specific things on education or
transportation. Spare the long, dull issues papers.</TE>
<TE>   Be upfront. Unfortunately for Simon, the tax issue has dragged on
too long. Release the returns. They're unnecessary baggage.</TE>
<TE>   Come up with at least one good, specific idea to help close the
state budget deficit. Cut more spending? OK, what? Exhibit some
courage.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid Billy Tyne's fate, Bill Simon will need to be less
cautious and more aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   He can't just keep drifting until November.</TE>

<HD>'Gigi' Delmaestro, 66; Maitre d' Made Everyone a Star</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He was the quintessential Hollywood maitre d', doling out tables and
booths to a celebrity clientele ranging from Madonna, Sylvester
Stallone and Adam Sandler to Jeffrey Katzenberg, Michael Ovitz and
the Reiners, Carl and Rob.</LD>
<LD>   But the Palm Restaurant in West Hollywood is not just a place for
stars, talent agents, studio executives and other entertainment
industry power eaters, Louis "Gigi" Delmaestro always insisted.</LD>
<LD>   "We try very hard to make everyone feel special," he said in an
interview several years ago. "I make everyone who comes in feel like
a star."</LD>
<TE>   Delmaestro, the Palm's gregarious Italian-born general
manager-maitre d', who was a fixture at the restaurant since it
opened in 1975, died Saturday of cancer at the home of his daughter
Madeline Tugentman, in Maplewood, N.J. He was 66.</TE>
<TE>   At the Palm, where the menu includes the Gigi salad, the
mustachioed Delmaestro was as much a part of the dining experience as
the celebrity caricatures on the wall and the restaurant's famous
steaks and lobster.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't come like Gigi anymore," said talk show host Larry
King, a friend of Delmaestro who eats at the Palm as often as three
times a week. "That's kind of a dying concept in restaurants, the
host who's always there.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of like show business: Gigi went on every day, two
shows a day, lunch and dinner. He knew how to treat people well, both
those coming in the door and the people in the kitchen. It was
comforting to come in and see him standing there at the desk."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone in show business, it seemed, knew Delmaestro.</TE>
<TE>   King said he attended the memorial service for Hollywood mogul Lew
Wasserman on Monday and "at least 20 people around me were talking
about Gigi [and his passing]. Everybody knew Gigi because the Palm
was a television and movie hangout."</TE>
<TE>   And yet, said Alan Horn, president of Warner Bros., Delmaestro was
"celebrity-blind, he was colorblind, he was prestige-blind. The
beauty of the place and the beauty of the man was he treated
everybody the same."</TE>
<TE>   Horn had been a customer of the Palm since it opened and became a
close friend of Delmaestro.</TE>
<TE>   "I got the feeling from him that he loved his work, he loved the
people who worked for him and he loved his customers," Horn said.
"That sense of his own devotion to everything about that place and
his work was almost visceral. It was part of his persona, of his
being, and it was communicated to me as a patron of this restaurant
and made me feel even more comfortable, even more welcome, even more
happy to be there.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a guy who loved his life."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Parma, Italy, Delmaestro came to the United States in 1950
at the age of 14 and entered the restaurant business two years later
as a busboy at Mario's Front Page on 46th Street in New York, where
he stayed for nearly 20 years and rose to general manager.</TE>
<TE>   He began working as a waiter at the original Palm Restaurant in
New York City in 1971 and helped open the Palm II in New York two
years later.</TE>
<TE>   Delmaestro joined Palm co-owner Wally Ganzi in opening the Palm in
West Hollywood in 1975 and after a few months working as a waiter,
moved into management.</TE>
<TE>   Delmaestro--he was called Gigi because a cousin couldn't pronounce
his real name, Luigi--attributed his skills as a maitre d' to
possessing a "great sense of people."</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of sense when they come in how they're going to react, and
basically I can almost sense what they're going to eat or drink," he
told The Times In 1998. "What makes me better than anybody else? I'm
seasoned. I've been doing this for a long, long time."</TE>
<TE>   Delmaestro is also survived by another daughter, Elizabeth
Salituri of Maplewood; his sister, Angela Delmaestro of Queens; and
three granddaughters.</TE>
<TE>   The family requests that memorial donations be made to the Gigi
Delmaestro Memorial Fund, in care of the USC-Kenneth Norris Jr.
Comprehensive Cancer Center, 1441 Eastlake Ave., Los Angeles, 90033,

<HD>Disneyland, Police See No Threat in Video From Terror
Suspect</HD>
<DH>Security: Officials say the tape seized in Spain showing
the Anaheim park, other landmarks is no cause for alarm because
they've been on alert since Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Disneyland, Anaheim police and federal officials Wednesday downplayed
any potential security risks stemming from the arrest of a terror
suspect in Spain and the seized videos that contain footage of U.S.
landmarks, including the Anaheim amusement park and the Golden Gate
Bridge.</LD>
<LD>   A Disneyland spokesman said that the park quickly determined there
was no credible threat, and that even if there had been, the park and
police have been on high alert since Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   "We work daily with the FBI and Anaheim Police Department,"
Disneyland spokesman Ray Gomez said. "Those are the law enforcement
agencies we rely on. We take our cues from them. If they tell us to
step up security, we will do it."</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, there was some confusion after Gov. Gray Davis' chief
security advisor, George Vinson, and officials from the California
Highway Patrol issued statements that they were doubling security at
the Golden Gate Bridge and quickly mobilizing local law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim police spokesman Sgt. Rick Martinez said the department
was not notified until late that afternoon--hours after they started
fielding media calls and began making their own inquiries about the
arrest of the suspected terrorist and the videotape seized from him.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez said police officials were curious about the delay in
notification and had to backtrack for information, but that they soon
realized there was no cause for alarm.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, Disneyland has checked all bags at entry gates,
restricted vehicle access to some areas in the resort, increased
security patrols and continued frequent communication with local and
federal law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, for example, police and the Orange County Sheriff's
Department bomb squad were called to Disneyland after the park's own
bomb-sniffing dog detected a suspicious odor from a truck. Police
closed nearby Ball Road for a while, but the truck ultimately was
cleared to enter.</TE>
<TE>   "What that tells you is that the security system we have in place
really does work," Gomez said. "We detained a suspicious vehicle. It
was proved not to be a threat. Our security system is working and
it's at high alert."</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A mall was evacuated and freeways became jammed with cars Wednesday
after a trailer carrying combustible and toxic materials overturned
in the City of Industry.</LD>
<LD>   About 11 a.m., a truck pulling two trailers containing liquid
peroxide, oil-based paints and acetone was on the Azusa Boulevard
onramp to the Pomona Freeway when its second trailer overturned.</LD>
<LD>   Because the cargo was flammable and could emit toxic fumes, county
hazardous material crews were summoned, and the Puente Hills Mall was
evacuated, as were about five miles of the freeway in both
directions.</LD>
<TE>   The northbound 605 Freeway connection also was closed.</TE>
<TE>   "The traffic was hellacious, an absolute nightmare," Fire
Inspector Ed Osorio said.</TE>
<TE>   The peroxide, in particular, posed a fire danger, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But only a few small containers opened, and the mall was reopened
by early afternoon, the freeway by about 3:20 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   No one was injured.</TE>

<HD>Davis Pushes for F-15Cs for Air National Guard</HD>
<DH>Defense: Governor says the warplanes are needed in the
fight on terror. Republicans assail the event after a statement
attacking Bill Simon is handed out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Bracketed between jet fighters and cheering National Guard troops,
Gov. Gray Davis on Wednesday asked the Pentagon to give California
faster and more lethal warplanes for terrorist duty in the skies.</LD>
<LD>   But the Democratic governor's appearance at a California National
Guard facility where he announced his request for F-15C Eagle
fighters was denounced by Republicans as an illegal use of state
employees and resources for political purposes.</LD>
<LD>   A top-level member of the governor's personal staff defended
Davis' appearance before the Guard members as an appropriate form of
official business, but conceded that a prepared statement by the
governor attacking Republican challenger Bill Simon Jr. was a mistake
and should not have happened.</LD>
<TE>   The governor arranged to announce his request for new aircraft
outside an Air National Guard hanger at the former Mather Air Force
Base near Sacramento. He spoke from a lectern framed against a
background of two jet fighters, an American flag and 50 applauding
Guard members in combat fatigues, flight suits and dress uniforms.
About 100 others sat on folding chairs in an audience in front of
him.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Air Force Secretary James G. Roche, Davis said the
Guard's current squadron of Fresno-based F-16 Falcons needed
"significant upgrades" for terrorist and other defense duties. He
said the more powerful, faster and better-armed F-15Cs are "better
suited" for homeland defense.</TE>
<TE>   He said he understood that the Air Force intends to reassign 19
F-15Cs to California or North Dakota. "This new airplane should be
deployed to California," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   The Guard members, many of whom had baked in the sun for more than
an hour waiting for the governor to arrive, applauded his speech
enthusiastically, as did Maj. Gen. Paul D. Monroe, commander of the
California Guard.</TE>
<TE>   In a printed statement distributed to reporters by aides at the
ceremony, Davis attacked Simon, who last month criticized the
readiness of the California National Guard. An Army veteran, Davis
said Simon never served in the military but had the "gall to
criticize our Guard's readiness."</TE>
<TE>   "All Bill Simon has demonstrated with his outrageous claims is
that he is the one person who isn't ready [to be governor]," the
document quoted Davis as saying.</TE>
<TE>   The governor did not repeat the criticism of his rival in his
actual speech or make any direct reference to Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Press Secretary Steven Maviglio said he did not approve the
statement before it was handed out but conceded it was a mistake to
include such partisan rhetoric in an official state document.</TE>
<TE>   "It should not be there," Maviglio said.</TE>
<TE>   However, the California Republican Party and the Simon campaign
pounced on Davis' event as a violation of state law prohibiting use
of state employees, equipment and other resources for political
purposes.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor is not content only to shake down the private sector
for campaign cash and support, but he also shakes down the National
Guard and state employees for that same support. It's wrong," said
Sean Walsh, a state GOP spokesman.</TE>

<HD>Joseph Luns, 90; Led NATO at a Critical Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joseph Luns, the Dutch foreign minister for 19 years and NATO chief
who guided the alliance through a critical Cold War decade, died
Wednesday. He was 90.</LD>
<LD>   A Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesman said Luns died at his home in
Brussels during the night. The cause of death was not announced, but
Luns had reportedly been in failing health.</LD>
<LD>   He was a leading statesman in the West during his long service as
the Netherlands' foreign minister and 13 years as NATO
secretary-general.</LD>
<TE>   He served in eight successive Dutch Cabinets until 1971, when he
was named head of NATO.</TE>
<TE>   He was regarded as one of the most vigorous and effective
architects of postwar European unity, and held an unshakable belief
in an Atlantic partnership, stressing the need for good relations
between Europe and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The tall, thin Luns loved jokes and brought a breezy personal
style to the North Atlantic alliance. His unorthodox approach made
him a favorite of journalists. Asked once how many people worked at
NATO headquarters, he responded: "About half of them."</TE>
<TE>   Before Luns took over, NATO had made a start on increasing the
European share of the Atlantic defense. He continued that trend,
pushing reluctant governments, including his own, into making a
greater defense effort.</TE>
<TE>   He laid heavy emphasis on building a stronger and more united
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Luns was born Aug. 28, 1911, in Rotterdam. He served in the Dutch
navy before studying law at the University of Leyden and the
University of Amsterdam. He received his doctorate in law from the
University of Amsterdam in 1937.</TE>
<TE>   His career in international politics was dotted with controversy,
especially in 1979 over disclosure of his prewar membership in a Nazi
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Luns' link to the Dutch national socialist movement from 1933 to
1936 surfaced in a newspaper story. It was confirmed soon afterward
and led to a full-scale parliamentary debate.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Luns first denied joining the group, then told the
government he was put on party lists without his knowledge by a
brother who later canceled the membership. Legislators decided
against holding an inquiry.</TE>

<HD>Museum Files Suit to Block Its Ouster by School District</HD>
<DH>Land use: Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified wants site for
special education program. Historical society says it has nowhere to
go.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIN CHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly popping out of a mural with his fiery red shirt and stern
stare, Juan Jose Dominguez surveys a 1784 land grant while eyeing a
roomful of South Bay artifacts. By his expression, it's as if the
Spanish soldier knows about the fight between two institutions for
the space in which he stands.</LD>
<LD>   The dispute between the Rancho de Los Palos Verdes Historical
Society Museum in Palos Verdes Estates and the Palos Verdes Peninsula
Unified School District escalated this week from a verbal tussle to a
courtroom battle.</LD>
<LD>   The school district told the museum in mid-June that it had until
Saturday to vacate its 3,800-square-foot facility and make way for
the school district, which wants the space for its special education
programs.</LD>
<TE>   The museum, which sits on school property and houses a large
display of Peninsula history, has refused, prompting the school
district to file a lawsuit Monday seeking to force it out.</TE>
<TE>   If the school district gets its way, Dominguez and the rest of the
mural would be protected by a plexiglass shield--or be destroyed--and
the items surrounding the painting would change from plows and swords
to dry-erase boards and desks.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the museum's 2,500 artifacts, including fossils of a
baleen whale's head, a mammoth's tusk and a floor-to-ceiling mural of
a Gabrielino Indian village, would have to move.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just dumbfounded," Sylvia B. Thompson of Rolling Hills
Estates said while visiting the museum this week. "I'm going to go
home and tell all my neighbors about this. How could you move a
mural?"</TE>
<TE>   Museum founder Mary Roderman said that besides an ownership issue,
the murals would be useless without the items they enhance. "What's
the point of the murals being here without the artifacts?" she said.</TE>
<TE>   But because artists painted the murals on public property, the
paintings belong to the school district, said Milan Smith, the
district's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   He said the district may preserve the murals, which took artists
Violet Parkhurst and Rodrigo Benitez about three years to paint. If a
chemical analysis shows lead in the paint, the district will destroy
the murals. Society board members say the paint does not contain
lead.</TE>
<TE>   At the core of the controversy are documents interpreted
differently by the school district and historical society board
members. The district says it allowed the society to use the property
on a yearly basis, but the historical society board contends the
agreement granted the museum a permanent site.</TE>
<TE>   An initial document, for example, grants usage of the space
"beginning September 1991 through August 1992" for a "permanent home
and museum for the Rancho de Los Verdes Historical Society."</TE>
<TE>   The society was "led to believe" that the annual renewal
agreements were "formalities," said Doug Foster, the museum's
attorney. But according to Smith, the language used to describe the
museum was written by Roderman and approved by a "low-level clerk."</TE>
<TE>   "These good folks," Smith said of the society board, "have the
preposterous legal argument" that a private person can condemn public
property.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never given them any kind of long-term assurance that they
could stay in that facility," said Supt. Ira Toibin. "We're a little
frustrated that we let them use the space for free.... It's small
thanks for the help we've given them."</TE>
<TE>   Toibin said the museum pays $49 a month for electricity, but no
rent. Capped by a tower with a seven-point crown, the museum is free
to the public and is run entirely by volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   The school district has tried to find the museum space in nearby
Rolling Hills Estates and Rancho Palos Verdes or on property owned by
the Palos Verdes Library District, but the society board "won't hear
of it," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Roderman said there is "absolutely not an alternative" for another
museum location, noting that the museum sits atop an old excavation
site for American Indian artifacts. "We hold the whole history of the
Peninsula in this very small space," Roderman said.</TE>
<TE>   The museum building is on the site of a closed intermediate
school. The property also is home to two private schools: the
International Bilingual School and Rolling Hills Preparatory.</TE>
<TE>   The school board has filed suit to evict the International
Bilingual School. Rolling Hills Preparatory also will have to leave
eventually, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   If the issue is resolved soon, the district will open its special
education school in September, Toibin said. It will serve 40 to 80
students from the Peninsula to Manhattan Beach.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Geoffrey Lowe, 9, of Rancho Palos Verdes visited the
museum to get an early start on Peninsula history for his upcoming
fourth-grade class. He glanced at rusted horseshoes, Spanish swords
and Juan Jose Dominguez. "It's really nice," he said of the museum
while staring at an embalmed rattlesnake. "It should stay here."</TE>

<LD>Jason Thornton got quite a surprise with his lunch Wednesday at the
Santa Monica Place mall.</LD>
<LD>   There he was, munching on his steak sandwich as an unusually high
number of infants around him suckled their mother's breasts.</LD>
<LD>   Thornton sat some distance away from the scene, not quite
understanding the sudden abundance of nursing children in the food
court.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought, wow, L.A. has changed a lot since the last time I've
been here," said Thornton, a 23-year-old shoe salesman from Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   The women were a contingent of about 70 mothers and a few fathers
from all over Los Angeles County who had gathered at the mall's food
court to make a statement about a woman's legal right to breast-feed
in public. The California Women's Law Center and the Breastfeeding
Task Force of Greater Los Angeles held the "nurse-in" because they've
been fielding numerous complaints from women who have been asked to
stop nursing in public places.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't know the law and employers aren't educating their
people," said Nancy Solomon, an attorney at the Women's Law Center.
In California, a woman has the right to breast-feed anywhere she and
her child are present, except at someone's private home, Solomon
said. It is illegal, Solomon added, to ask a nursing mother to cover
herself or to ask her to go somewhere else.</TE>
<TE>   As Abbe Dotson, 27, of El Segundo walked near the mall's food
court last month while nursing her daughter, Ruby Jane, a security
guard asked Dotson to cover herself.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he'd been getting complaints," Dotson said, as she fed
Ruby Jane. "He actually said that I was showing too much cleavage."</TE>
<TE>   Dotson was soon put in touch with the Women's Law Center and
subsequently the "nurse-in" was planned.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm taking care of my daughter in nourishing her and feeding her
and I'm being made to feel obscene for it," Dotson said.</TE>
<TE>   The women at the nurse-in cradled their children in their arms and
quietly chatted. Andrea Young, 25, wore a white tank top with the
words "Breastfeeding is not a Crime" emblazoned in red.</TE>
<TE>   Photographers and camera crews showed up to capture the event on
film. No formal speeches or picket signs were scheduled. This was
just a gathering of mothers doing what nature intended, participants
said. The protest was so subtle that some mall patrons had no idea
what was going on.</TE>
<TE>   "People usually don't know she's nursing, they just think she's
hugging me," said Jennifer Hoff, 31, who has been breast-feeding her
daughter Chloe for 21 months and Chloe's older sister, Allie, for six
years. In explanation, Hoff said her daughter has asked, "But Mom,
how will I get all my vitamins?"</TE>
<TE>   Those patrons who did notice the profusion of babies wondered what
was up.</TE>
<TE>   "All these babies! What do I do to get one?" asked one woman.</TE>
<TE>   Most patrons stared for a few seconds and moved on.</TE>
<TE>   "You gotta do what you gotta do," said Pete Defoe, 41, of
Glendale. "If a kid gets hungry, you can't tell the kid no."</TE>
<TE>   Others were more supportive.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm all for it!" shouted one man as he rushed through the mall's
exit. "Go team!"</TE>

be," Merritt said.</CP>

<HD>Mystified by Voices Coming From Your Radio? Try Turning the
'Off' Button</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of Paramount's newsletter says that a resident phoned
authorities "to report that he was hearing voices coming from his
radio." Must be a haunting experience, especially if all he hears is
talk radio.</LD>
<LD>   The SWAT team wasn't dispatched for this one, either: The police
log of the Los Alamitos News-Enterprise carried a complaint about a
gent who "threw his clothes on the bed because he knew it upset his
wife." Bet he leaves the toilet seat up too.</LD>
<LD>   The rising postal rates have everyone on edge: The
News-Enterprise's crime report also said a woman called the Joint
Forces Training Base in Los Alamitos, "cussed at the man who answered
and was disrespectful to the federal government."</LD>
<TE>   Harrumph for Hollywood: Is Tinseltown trying to secede or does it
intend to take over the City of Angels? Dick Barnes of Long Beach
noticed a magazine's discount dining guide had already wiped L.A. off
the map (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Shear enjoyment? Margaret Sargent of L.A. received a flier from an
establishment whose name caused her to ask: "Do you suppose they
offer to rinse the hair in beer?" (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Food for thought: Unless it's an attack on the media, Scott
Shulman thinks he came upon a funny malapropism on a sign (see
photo). Shulman recalled a fowl pun that the late Times columnist
Jack Smith used for a type of blooper (and it certainly is
appropriate here): a "pullet surprise."</TE>
<TE>   Ooh L.A. L.A.: French journalist Alain Jeannin tells me that "Los
Angeles," a melancholy song by Benjamin Biolay, is a hit in his
country. Which should come as no surprise. Jeannin noted the City of
Angels holds a fascination for the French, citing the popularity of
the recent movie "Mulholland Drive" and the mystery novels of James
Ellroy and Michael Connelly.</TE>
<TE>   Another popular French song of a few years back was "California"
by Mylene Farmer, which was set in an L.A. hotel room. Jeannin called
the song "dark and erotic." And before that there was Jane Birkin's
"Baby Alone in Babylone," which had an L.A. connection, sort of a
"sur les freeways de L.A." theme.</TE>
<TE>   Ooh L.A. L.A. (Part Deux): I'm not sure whether this genre should
include Frank Black's English-language song "Los Angeles," which was
also big in France in the early 1990s. It goes like this: "I wanna
live in Los Angeles/Not the one in Los Angeles/No, not the one in
South California/ They got one in South Patagonia."</TE>
<TE>   They do indeed have a Los Angeles in Chile's South Patagonia
region. I wonder if that L.A. has secession problems.</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: As for the controversy over whether to name Bodie or
Calico the official state ghost town, a friend of mine has a
compromise choice: "How about downtown L.A. after dark?"</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phyllis White, 79, a founding member of the first television writers
union who wrote for popular shows in the 1960s and '70s, died of a
stroke July 7 at her home in Venice.</LD>
<LD>   White was born in Pierre, S.D., and graduated from the University

<TE>   White won a Peabody Award in 1955 for her work on the documentary
series "Adventure" and was twice honored for outstanding scripts by
the Writers Guild of America.</TE>
<TE>   In 1950, she helped found the Television Writers of America, the
first TV writers union, which was folded into the Writers Guild of
America in 1954.</TE>
<TE>   She later was active in the Writers Guild, serving on its board of
directors and as vice president during the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   In collaboration with her husband, Robert White, she wrote for
such shows as "The Bold Ones," "Cannon," "Death Valley Days,"

<LD>The son of an Orange County assistant sheriff and two other teenagers
pleaded not guilty Wednesday to raping an unconscious 16-year-old
girl and recording it on videotape.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Craig Robison set bail for the youths, who
are each 17 and charged as adults, at $100,000 each. Gregory Scott
Haidl, Kyle Joseph Nachreiner and Keith James Spann each face 21

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Seal Beach man has been sentenced to nearly three years in prison
for failing to pay state income taxes on his earnings and the
$326,000 he allegedly embezzled from his employer's bank account.</LD>
<LD>   Richard A. Morley, 58, was convicted in May of failing to file
state income tax returns for 1998 and 1999, and failing to report
more than $300,000 in gross income from both his earnings and the
allegedly embezzled funds, said Patrick Hill of the state Franchise
Tax Board.</LD>
<LD>   The jury deadlocked on theft and forgery charges stemming from the
alleged wire transfers from Morley's employer's account, for his own
use, from 1997 to 2000. He faces a new trial in September.</LD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George R. Richter Jr., a founding partner of the Los Angeles-based
law firm of Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp; Hampton who helped draft the
state Uniform Commercial Code governing all commercial transactions,
has died. He was 92.</LD>
<LD>   Richter, who specialized in labor law and banking and financial
law, died Monday in La Jolla. The cause of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   Richter, who headed a number of committees for the American Bar
Assn. and the Los Angeles County Bar Assn., had a long involvement
with the Uniform Commercial Code.</LD>
<TE>   In 1948, he was appointed chairman of the first State Bar of
California committee to study the code.</TE>
<TE>   In 1953 he became a member of the permanent editorial board of the
Uniform Commercial Code.</TE>
<TE>   He also served as president of the National Conference of
Commissioners on Uniform State Laws from 1959 through 1961.</TE>
<TE>   And from 1951 through 1986, he served as a member of the
California Commission on Uniform State Laws and was commission
chairman from 1956 through 1973.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, the state Legislature passed a resolution recognizing his
work.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Richter donated $1 million for the advancement of
teaching, research and scholarship at his alma mater, the USC School
of Law.</TE>
<TE>   "George Richter is a shining example of the consummate lawyer, one
who has practiced law at the highest levels of professionalism and
contributed significantly to the improvement of the legal system
through his truly outstanding work with the movement to create
uniform state laws," Scott H. Bice, the dean of the law school, said
of him at the time.</TE>
<TE>   In recognition of his gift, the lobby of the main entrance to the
law school was dedicated as the George R. Richter Commons.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Blue Island, Ill., in 1910, Richter moved with his family
to Los Angeles after graduating from Culver Military Academy in
Culver, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   He earned his undergraduate degree from USC, and while attending
law school he joined what was then Mathes &amp; Sheppard as a law clerk
in 1932.</TE>
<TE>   After being admitted to the state bar in 1933, he became an
associate at the firm.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the Depression and clients were few.</TE>
<TE>   No longer able to afford Richter's $85 monthly salary, Mathes &amp;
Sheppard in 1934 gave him a leave of absence until the firm could
afford to take him back.</TE>
<TE>   Richter joined the legal department of Security First National
Bank in downtown Los Angeles, where he began developing an expertise
in commercial and banking law.</TE>
<TE>   After returning to Mathes &amp; Sheppard in 1936, he served lending
clients and became an expert in labor law. Richter became a partner
in 1941 and a name partner in 1945.</TE>
<TE>   He supported numerous local community and philanthropic causes,
including St. Joseph's Hospital in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   Richter also served on the board of trustees of the Newport Harbor
Art Museum, now the Orange County Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   Richter is survived by his wife, Betty Jane; his son, Craig, of
Laguna Beach; and his daughter, Georgann Lovejoy, of Palm Desert.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held at 2:30 p.m. Saturday at Pacific
View Memorial Park, 3500 Pacific View Drive, Corona del Mar.</TE>

<LD>A jury has convicted a businesswoman of plotting the kidnapping of a
private investigator, but was unable to reach a verdict on whether
she also had him killed.</LD>
<LD>   The partial verdict followed a trial in federal court that
included testimony from a woman convicted of spying for the Soviet
Union in the 1980s and gruesome allegations that the private
investigator was tortured in Tijuana.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors said a majority voted to convict Kimberly Bailey on a
federal charge of conspiracy to murder in a foreign country, but that
several members of the panel were unsure because authorities never
found the body of private investigator Richard Post, who disappeared
in 1998.</LD>

<LD>A state budget cut has forced Hearst Castle to reduce the tours it
can offer by 10%, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   About 86,000 fewer people will be able to take the tours this year
as a result, officials said. The decrease was part of cuts intended
to trim the state's projected $24-billion deficit.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, about 860,000 tours were taken at the hilltop estate of
William Randolph Hearst, said Kirk Sturm, superintendent of the San
Simeon State Parks District.</LD>
<TE>   The castle could lose more than $800,000 in ticket and other sales
as a result of the cutback.</TE>

<LD>Police Chief David Bejarano has decided against having officers
search the massive Otay Mesa landfill for clues in the April 25
disappearance of 2-year-old Jahi Turner.</LD>
<LD>   Bejarano said health officials warned that searchers would be
vulnerable to disease from germs at the landfill. Also, he said there
is no evidence that there are clues buried in the mounds of trash.</LD>
<LD>   In May, police and others searched the city landfill at Miramar
without success. The boy's stepfather, Tieray Jones, 23, told police
the child disappeared while left alone for several minutes at Balboa
Park.</LD>

<HD>Death of Proposal Revivifies Secession</HD>
<DH>Government: Valley and Hollywood breakaway leaders say City
Council's decision not to place a borough option on the ballot will
benefit their campaigns.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Leaders of the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood secession movements
Wednesday sought to capitalize on the Los Angeles City Council's
decision to kill a borough proposal for the Nov. 5 ballot, saying the
panel's action will boost the breakup campaign.</LD>
<LD>   The council's rejection of the borough plan this week sent a
message to voters that City Hall is unwilling to share power by
giving local communities more authority over spending, land use and
the distribution of services, the secessionists said.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the death of the borough proposal removed from
the secession campaign a distraction that might have siphoned votes
from the breakup measures, said Hollywood Independence Committee
chair Gene La Pietra.</LD>
<TE>   "Now that the council has defeated the borough proposals ... we
are optimistic for a positive campaign," LaPietra said.</TE>
<TE>   Former Assemblyman Richard Katz, who heads the Valley secession
campaign, said the council's scuttling of boroughs "reinforces that
City Hall is incapable of reforming itself."</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge Has Other Ideas</TE>
<TE>   However, Hollywood-area Councilman Tom LaBonge said reform at City
Hall is not dead. LaBonge unveiled a motion Wednesday that would
establish "service delivery districts" throughout the city to
customize services for local problems. There would be seven
districts, with regional offices staffed by employees transferred
from City Hall. The idea is make it easier for residents to apply for
permits, arrange for street repairs and get their trees trimmed
without have to travel downtown.</TE>
<TE>   'Magic' Joins the Team</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, basketball legend Earvin "Magic" Johnson formally
joined the anti-secession team Wednesday as co-chair of Mayor James
K. Hahn's campaign to keep Los Angeles together.</TE>
<TE>   "He's someone I believe has enormous credibility not only in the
African American community but all over the city," Hahn said at a
news conference at the Magic Johnson Theatres in the Crenshaw
Shopping Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, the Los Angeles Ethics Commission received a
complaint from a Hollywood cityhood leader alleging Council President
Alex Padilla is campaigning against secession on city time.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Jay, a board member of the Hollywood Independence Committee,
contends that Padilla crossed the line at a news conference Monday by
attacking secession while announcing plans to replace worn-out
garbage cans and recycling containers.</TE>
<TE>   David Gershwin, a spokesman for Padilla, said the councilman's
remarks were appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   "He was highlighting the improved service and he was not
explicitly telling voters how to vote," Gershwin said.</TE>
<TE>   Secession Vote Protested</TE>
<TE>   In another development, county officials said 4,175 Valley
residents have filed written protests against putting the secession
measure on the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The number is a small fraction of the more than 700,000 protests,
which would represent half the registered voters in Los Angeles, that
must be filed by July 25 to stop the secession election.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Beth Shuster contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Sex Focus of Speculation, Not Evidence, in Van Dam Trial</HD>
<DH>Court: Lawyers' attention to parents' 'swinger' lifestyle
or suspect's pornography may play on jurors' emotions but proves
nothing, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The murder trial of David Westerfield has been replete with
scientific testimony about topics ranging from computers to DNA to
the lifecycle of bugs, but there has been a surprising dearth of
testimony about an issue at the heart of the case: sex.</LD>
<LD>   From Day 1, the prosecution and defense have sought to use
accusations about sex to persuade jurors.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek, in his opening statement, said the
fact that Westerfield kept child pornography on his computer shows
that he harbors sexual obsessions about young girls. Westerfield is
accused of the kidnapping and murder of 7-year-old Danielle van Dam.</LD>
<TE>   Defense attorney Steven Feldman responded by suggesting that
police bungled the case by not investigating people who may have been
drawn to Danielle's home to partake in her parents' sexually
adventurous lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman later quizzed Damon and Brenda van Dam about their sex
lives and called witnesses to show that Brenda propositioned people
at a local bar to come back to the couple's home in tidy, upscale
Sabre Springs.</TE>
<TE>   But neither side has called any scientists or researchers to
support their contrasting assertions: that possession of child
pornography indicates a dangerous fetish, or that sexual "swingers"
are potential murder suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason we haven't seen evidence like that is that none
exists," said Gary Gibson, adjunct professor of law at California
Western School of Law in San Diego and a veteran criminal defense
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA psychology professor Neil M. Malamuth, an expert on the
relationship between pornography and violence, said that possession
of pornography, taken as an isolated fact about someone, cannot be
said to be proof of a tendency toward fetishes or antisocial
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ansar Haroun, a clinical professor at UC San Diego and
supervising psychiatrist for San Diego Superior Court, agreed with
Malamuth. Without the presence of risk factors such as a history of
hostility toward women or childhood traumas, pornography is not a
sign that a person is capable of sexual violence, Haroun said.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking at pornographic pictures does not give you fetishes, any
more than looking at pictures of goats gives you a fetish about
goats," said Haroun, who is not involved in the Westerfield case.</TE>
<TE>   As for Feldman's assertion about "swingers" being murder suspects,
sexuality researchers say that an appetite for recreational adult sex
does not indicate a potential for violence.</TE>
<TE>   A leading defense attorney in San Diego said it is unfortunate
that Dusek and Feldman have needlessly made sex an issue in an
already gut-wrenching trial.</TE>
<TE>   "Both sides would say, 'No, no, no, we're just arguing the logic
of our position,' " Eugene Iredale said. "But both are using sex to
play on the emotions of jurors. The prosecution is saying, 'He's
guilty because only pedophiles look at child pornography,' and the
defense says, 'The parents are so kinky their friends must have done
it.' That's the undertone of the trial."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Bob Grimes said sex is a legitimate issue in the
trial, but added that both attorneys are running the risk of
diverting attention away from more important issues, such as the DNA
evidence and the dispute about when Danielle was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Samples of the dead girl's hair, blood and fingerprints, found in
Westerfield's home and recreational vehicle, may establish a link
between Westerfield and the crime. Yet one expert witness' estimate
of the time of Danielle's death seems to undercut the prosecution by
suggesting that Danielle was killed after Westerfield was being
watched 24 hours a day by police. The expert, an entomologist, based
his theory of the time of death on the number and age of bugs found
on the body.</TE>
<TE>   Grimes said that such complex testimony could be overshadowed by
the emphasis on sex. "Sex is dangerous at trial," he said. "It can
distract the jury by showing them things that are more interesting
but less [relevant]."</TE>
<TE>   And Grimes said that if Westerfield is convicted, one possible
basis for appeal will be that the pornography, especially the child
pornography, unfairly biased the jury against Westerfield and that
Superior Court Judge William Mudd should never have allowed the jury
to see it.</TE>
<TE>   The law says material that is unrelated to the criminal charges
should be excluded from the jury if it would have a prejudicial
affect on the defendant's right to a fair trial. But the
determination of what is prejudicial is a subjective one. The judge
has permitted testimony that Westerfield drank to excess and became
sullen and hostile when he was drinking, but he would not allow
jurors to be told that Westerfield, 50, a design engineer, was
convicted of drunk driving in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield told police he was "pretty drunk" the night before
Danielle's disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   Before the trial, defense attorney Feldman argued that the
misdemeanor charge of possession of child pornography should be
separated from the murder and kidnapping charges because it would
unfairly prejudice the jury against Westerfield.</TE>
<TE>   Mudd rejected Feldman's request, but ruled that only a fraction of
the pornographic images kept in computers in Westerfield's home would
be shown to the jury.</TE>
<TE>   But that small number of images had an apparently powerful effect.
When jurors were shown a video that seemed to simulate a young girl
being raped, two jurors began to weep and others averted their eyes.</TE>
<TE>   After failing to block the introduction of the material, Feldman
countered with testimony from a computer expert who suggested that
the pornography had been downloaded not by Westerfield but by his
teenage son.</TE>
<TE>   In using allegations about sexual conduct that are unsupported by
scientific evidence, Gibson said, both sides are benefiting from the
so-called Victims' Bill of Rights measure that in 1982 amended the
state Constitution. It permitted the introduction of any trial
evidence that has "any tendency in reason to prove or disprove any
disputed fact."</TE>
<TE>   Even if an appellate court determines that Mudd was wrong in
permitting the pornography as evidence, it could rule that it was a
"harmless error" that did not influence the verdict, Gibson said.</TE>
<TE>   When the trial resumes July 22, Feldman will have the opportunity
to introduce expert testimony that questions the relevance of the
child pornography.</TE>
<TE>   But, as Gibson has pointed out, that would give the prosecution a
second chance to show jurors the shocking images downloaded onto
Westerfield's computer.</TE>

<HD>Reaction Mixed to Park Tax</HD>
<DH>Hearings: Owners of hillside properties speak out on a
proposed levy to fund land purchases in the Santa Monicas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A plan to increase parkland in the Santa Monica Mountains by taxing
40,000 to 50,000 hillside property owners in Los Angeles drew mixed
reaction at two public meetings Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "It appears that we are being taxed to give private property to
the government," resident Gloria Fisher told park officials at an
afternoon informational hearing attended by about 120 people at Bel
Air Presbyterian Church on Mulholland Drive.</LD>
<LD>   Others, however, said they see the tax as a rare opportunity to
spend a small amount of money to preserve the tranquillity of
mountain properties in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of us moved here for the quality of life," Wendy-Sue Rosen
said on behalf of the Upper Mandeville Canyon Assn. of homeowners.
"What else is there in this age of gridlock and overdevelopment?"</TE>
<TE>   The Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, a regional
park agency that owns about 35,000 acres of Santa Monica Mountains
wilderness, wants to tax each single-family home in the proposed area
about $40 a year and use the funds to buy open space, protect
wildlife and clear brush for fire protection. Businesses would pay
about $120 per acre, and apartment building owners would be assessed
on a sliding scale.</TE>
<TE>   The tax will be imposed if a simple majority of property owners
approve it. The votes are weighted, based on the amount of assessment
that would be paid.</TE>
<TE>   Mail-in ballots, which have already been sent out, are due to the
park agency by Aug. 14 or may be hand-delivered at a public hearing
to be held that day. The results will be announced on Aug. 21.</TE>
<TE>   Several residents voiced suspicion that the money would not be
spent properly.</TE>
<TE>   "I can assure you that the plan for Mulholland will include a lot
of lights, water and parking lots," said Sue Nelson, a member of
Friends of the Santa Monica Mountains. "I'm just very upset over the
kind of spin that's being put on this."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the meeting, Jerry Daniel, board chairman of the park
agency, disputed Nelson's prediction. "There's not going to be swings
and ball fields. It's going to be left natural," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The tax would generate each year about $2 million, which the park
agency would combine with matching funds from the state and other
sources to buy undeveloped properties in the taxed area.</TE>
<TE>   An evening public meeting, attended by close to 100 people, was
held at the Franklin Canyon Park nature center.</TE>
<TE>   Privately owned open space in the mountains is under constant
development pressure, Daniel said.</TE>
<TE>   His agency has proposed two tax districts that would straddle the
Santa Monica Mountains. The combined tax area would stretch from
Topanga Canyon Boulevard east to the Golden State Freeway and from
Ventura Boulevard south to Sunset Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Two districts are needed to ensure that the proceeds would be
spent on land near the homes paying the tax, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Inglewood Schools Chief Steps Down After 2 Years</HD>
<DH>Education: James Harris resigns to return to his native
Michigan as head of a suburban district.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After only two years in office, Inglewood's schools superintendent
resigned Wednesday night to run a suburban district in his native
Michigan.</LD>
<LD>   James Harris said he will become superintendent of the school
district in Taylor, a Detroit suburb, later this month.</LD>
<LD>   Harris, 55, spent much of his early education career in Detroit.
The move, he said, would put him closer to his beloved alma mater,
the University of Michigan, and, with his years of service in
Michigan schools, provide a better-funded retirement.</LD>
<TE>   "I got an offer that I could not refuse," Harris said. "I am sad
to leave, but I'm going back home. I have 19 years of experience back
there, and that's important with retirement coming up."</TE>
<TE>   Harris had never worked in California before arriving at the
18,000-student Inglewood school district in summer 2000. He
previously had been superintendent in Buffalo, N.Y., where he earned
a reputation for reviving music and performing arts programs.</TE>
<TE>   In Inglewood, Harris furthered that reputation, opening popular
arts magnets in the elementary schools and performing arts academies
in the high schools. He is fond of talking about the new band
uniforms. School officials credit him with improvements in student
attendance and a reduction in the percentage of the district's
noncredentialed teachers--from more than half to about one-third.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that Dr. Harris was certainly a visionary in the sense
that he had innovative ideas and brought some good academic programs
to the district," school board member Gloria Gray said.</TE>
<TE>   While Inglewood maintained its reputation for strong elementary
schools under Harris' watch, he was unable to make major improvements
at Inglewood and Morningside high schools, both of which have the
lowest rankings on the state's Academic Performance Index. "That's
the life of school districts," board President Cresia Green-Davis
said of Harris' departure after two years. "I'm happy for Dr.
Harris."</TE>
<TE>   Board members said they would install as interim superintendent
Paul Possemato, a former Laguna Beach superintendent and Los Angeles
Unified School District administrator. Possemato also served as
Inglewood's interim superintendent before Harris' arrival in 2000. A
national search for a new superintendent is likely, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Toll Road Boards Get Merger Talks Started</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Agencies survey a plan some say can save
the ailing San Joaquin Hills turnpike.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's two toll road agencies met Wednesday to discuss
merging, a proposal some say might save the financially ailing San
Joaquin Hills toll road as well as the plans to build another tollway
south of Mission Viejo.</LD>
<LD>   The first of many expected workshops on the proposal was devoted
to reviewing the legal complexities of melding the independent boards
and seeing whether the idea is politically and economically feasible.</LD>
<LD>   "This kicked it off," said Clare Climaco, a spokeswoman for the
Transportation Corridor Agencies, regarding the 90-minute meeting on
new board structure and legal issues.</LD>
<TE>   The San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency and the
Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency both are under the
umbrella of the TCA, but each is financed separately and run by a
separate board.</TE>
<TE>   The San Joaquin board suggested the consolidation in April, and a
month later the Foothill/Eastern board agreed to study the idea.
Proponents say the merger could save the San Joaquin Hills toll road,
which has failed to meet traffic and revenue projections since
opening from Costa Mesa to San Juan Capistrano in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the beginning of a yearlong process," Walter D. Kreutzen,
chief executive of the Irvine-based TCA, said when the merger plans
were announced.</TE>
<TE>   "Although we don't know yet whether a merger will work, I don't
think there is any other way to go right now."</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's meeting, legal consultants outlined several ways
the boards could combine. One major problem is financing.</TE>
<TE>   Because a consolidated agency would have to sell bonds to pay off
debts and finance the roads, its governing board could not be
controlled by a majority of members from either of the old agencies'
boards.</TE>
<TE>   "The important thing is that in order for the market to accept
this transaction it has to know that the new board will not be
controlled by either of the previous existing agencies," Climaco
said. "Determining a potential board structure is really fundamental
to the process.''</TE>

<HD>Simi Valley Union Threatens a Walkout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 100 members of Simi Valley's largest public employees union
are threatening to walk off the job next week after last-ditch
settlement talks Wednesday failed to produce a new contract
agreement.</LD>
<LD>   The strike threat followed an offer branded as substandard by
union officials. The walkout, which union officials said would begin
July 25, would include police dispatchers, bus drivers, custodians,
mechanics and dozens of clerks and secretaries.</LD>
<LD>   "Their offer is a small reprieve for a couple of years," said
Nancy Fisher, a city customer service representative and member of
the bargaining team for Service Employees International Union's Local
998. "In the long run, it takes us nowhere."</LD>
<TE>   The union's most recent contract expired June 30. Members will
take a final vote on the most recent offer Monday.</TE>
<TE>   During a three-hour meeting at City Hall on Wednesday, a dozen
negotiators for both sides debated the union's request for a
four-year contract that includes a pay hike and improved health
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, city negotiators offered a 4% annual increase in pay
and health benefits for the next four years, for a total of 16%.
Union members want closer to 21% total, including major changes to
the current medical plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, there are no medical benefits for our retirees, and
employees are paying nearly $300 out of pocket each month for an
HMO," said Zelma Baer, a union negotiator who works in the city's
accounting department.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders say city management and municipal employees working
in neighboring cities receive medical packages that offer 100%
coverage for an employee and a second person.</TE>
<TE>   City leaders say their offer, which equates to nearly $6 million,
provides ample funds for union members to pay for insurance. Union
leaders say the city's offer does not take into account continually
increasing premiums.</TE>
<TE>   "Their offer is just not enough money to cover our insurance,"
Baer said. "We're looking for 100% coverage."</TE>
<TE>   As for salaries, members of the local are seeking a 3% pay
increase, union leaders said. The average union member earns about
$16 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a fairly sizable offer on the table right now," Mayor
Pro Tem Glen Becerra said. "It's a fair offer considering the current
economic times."</TE>
<TE>   But union bargaining President Edgar McLemore, sounding tired but
resolved after Wednesday's meeting, said city officials in earlier
meetings had offered closer to a 19% increase over four years, but
then backpedaled.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not getting anywhere any other way," McLemore said. "The
strike will occur."</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley's Local 998 represents about 300 clerical and
technical workers, nearly half the city's work force. Dues-paying
members, a majority of whom voted to authorize a strike last month,
number about 160.</TE>
<TE>   Although union negotiators tentatively rejected the city's final
offer Wednesday, they will present the deal to members during a
meeting Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Union members can vote either by mail or at the meeting to accept
or reject the offer. Union leaders said there was little doubt the
offer would be rejected and the strike would occur.</TE>
<TE>   "If employees choose to [strike], we have contingency plans in
place to ensure there isn't any impact on the essential services,"
Assistant City Manager Laura Magelnicki said.</TE>
<TE>   She declined to discuss details of the plan, but said police
dispatching, sanitation services and buses would continue operating.
Such things as building permits, tree-trimming projects and water
bill payments could take additional days to process, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're concerned about there being a strike," Magelnicki said. "A
strike doesn't do anybody any good."</TE>

<HD>Sanity Question Goes to Virk's Jury</HD>
<DH>Courts: Defense calls the woman who tried to drown her
children 'very sick.' Prosecutor says she knew what she was doing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A distraught Port Hueneme mother was suffering from a severe mental
illness the night she tried to drown her two children and should be
found legally insane, a defense lawyer argued Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Gesturing to her teary-eyed client, attorney Cynthia Ellington
told jurors that 42-year-old Narinder Virk could not tell right from
wrong when she walked her children to Channel Islands Harbor two
years ago and pushed them off a dock.</LD>
<LD>   "What she did that night was the result of an insane delusion,"
Ellington argued during the sanity phase of Virk's trial. "This is a
very, very sick woman."</LD>
<TE>   But prosecutor Richard Simon argued that evidence presented during
the first phase of Virk's trial shows that she deliberately tried to
kill her children to punish her estranged husband.</TE>
<TE>   Simon urged jurors to find Virk sane.</TE>
<TE>   "She knew what she was doing," he argued. "And she knew it was
wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Virk sat hunched over a courtroom table during Wednesday's closing
arguments in Ventura County Superior Court. Draped in a pale green
scarf, she periodically dabbed her eyes while listening to the
lawyers argue about her mental stability.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, jurors found Virk guilty on two counts of attempted
murder after finding she deliberately tried to drown her children on
Jan. 12, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   According to the children's testimony, Virk woke them in the
middle of the night, led them to the harbor and pushed them off a
dock before jumping in herself. The children, now 8 and 11, did not
know how to swim.</TE>
<TE>   Virk was arrested after an Oxnard resident pulled the family from
the water. She pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.</TE>
<TE>   During the first phase of Virk's trial, Ellington argued that her
client, an illiterate Indian immigrant, was brutalized by her husband
and unable to seek help because of language and cultural barriers.</TE>
<TE>   Ellington said Virk suffered a mental breakdown after her husband
boarded a plane for India with plans to divorce her.</TE>
<TE>   However, Simon argued that Virk intentionally tried to drown her
children to punish her allegedly abusive spouse.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, he told jurors that Virk was not the helpless victim
portrayed by the defense. He described her as a cunning, selfish and
vengeful woman who deliberately tried to drown her children.</TE>
<TE>   "All this talk of abuse," he said. "Where is the evidence of it?
Where is the corroboration?"</TE>
<TE>   Simon repeatedly reminded jurors they found that Virk
intentionally tried to kill her children--a finding he suggested
conflicts with the defense theory that she was insane.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor did not dispute a diagnosis of depression offered
by at least four mental health experts during the trial. But he
argued it was not the reason Virk pushed her children off the dock.</TE>
<TE>   Ellington, however, pointed to the testimony of three
psychiatrists during the sanity phase that Virk was suffering from
delusions and was insane when she pushed her children off the dock.</TE>
<TE>   Virk probably suffered from a mental illness that went undiagnosed
for years, Ellington argued.</TE>
<TE>   Deliberations are expected to begin this morning.</TE>

<LD>Ventura County supervisors this week approved a series of projects
aimed at improving safety along Santa Rosa Road near Camarillo.</LD>
<LD>   A new traffic signal at Yucca Drive is intended to slow traffic
along the rural two-lane road, which is heavily used by motorists as
an east-west alternative to the Ventura Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   Other improvements include cutting deep grooves along the road's
center and shoulders to warn drivers when they are drifting from
their lane.</LD>
<TE>   Additional signs warning motorists about speed, no-passing zones
and the presence of school bus stops are also in the works.</TE>

<HD>Ocean-Bound Sewage to Be Fully Treated</HD>
<DH>Environment: Orange County Sanitation District, persuaded
by clean-beach arguments, agrees to drop its waiver.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA and JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By one vote, the Orange County Sanitation District late Wednesday
opted to abandon a federal waiver that allows it to release into the
ocean dirtier sewage than nearly all of the nation's 16,000 other
sewer agencies.</LD>
<LD>   In doing so, the district agreed to comply with the requirements
of the federal Clean Water Act.</LD>
<LD>   "By us developing a policy of full secondary [standard of
treatment], there's no need for a waiver," said Brian Brady, a
representative of the Irvine Ranch Water District, who made the
motion not to seek another waiver. He said the sanitation district
will have to negotiate with federal regulators, "but I have full
confidence that [sanitation district staff] can do that."</LD>
<TE>   County Supervisor Tom Wilson, who opposed seeking another waiver,
said that "as long as we're going in the right direction with the
right speed, those agencies will applaud us for what we're doing, not
penalize us."</TE>
<TE>   An overflow crowd of more than 200 people listened to the
speakers' comments during the nearly four-hour meeting. They packed
the boardroom, another nearby room and spilled out onto the lawn.
When the vote was announced, the spectators cheered.</TE>
<TE>   The sanitation district is the largest of 36 agencies nationwide
holding a five-year waiver to the federal Clean Water Act. That
waiver expires in June 2003. Canceling the waiver will bring a higher
level of treatment, although it will take about 11 years and about
$400 million to get there, district officials say. That would mean an
average cost increase of $16 annually for homeowners and a major
increase for large businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The price tag does not sit well with Julie Puentes of the Orange
County Business Council. "It will not be acceptable for rate payers
to bear the cost ... only to find that the [beach pollution] problem
continues," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But other speakers countered that the cost will be minimal
compared to the economic gain of cleaning up the area's beaches.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is [that] the end user is going to have to pay a
little bit more," said Ken Kramer, president of the California State
Lifeguards Assn. "Let me have the honor of being the first," he said
as he handed an official a $16 check.</TE>
<TE>   The Clean Water Act requires two levels of treatment to kill most
bacteria and viruses before sewage is discharged into oceans, rivers
and lakes. Since 1977, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has
been allowed to grant waivers to this requirement in cases where it
would not harm the environment or public health. In California, state
water regulators must also sign off on the five-year waiver.</TE>
<TE>   The district, which serves more than 2.7 million customers in
central and northern Orange County, discharges 243 million gallons of
moderately treated sewage into the ocean daily. The waiver means that
only half of that sewage receives two levels of treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Abandoning the waiver seemed to have greater support on the board
until sanitation district lawyers warned that while the new treatment
facility is being built, the agency would be liable for at least
$3,000 a day in fines because it would not have a waiver in place.
Some board members railed against the staff for raising this issue at
the last minute, but in the end, the board voted 13 to 12 not to seek
extension of the waiver.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher J. Evans, executive director of the Surfrider
Foundation, said after the vote that "what happened today is a
victory for generations in Orange County and marine life and the
economy."</TE>

<HD>San Diego Water Crisis Is Called a False Alarm</HD>
<DH>Health: Officials say reports of bacteria in supplies were
incorrect.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Civic fears over the possibility of tainted water eased Wednesday
night when follow-up tests showed that earlier tests that found
illness-causing bacteria in the county's water supply were apparently
erroneous.</LD>
<LD>   Nine of 23 local water agencies had immediately stopped buying
water from the regional San Diego County Water Authority when results
released Tuesday from monitoring at 11 sites purported to show the
presence of a coliform bacteria that can cause vomiting, fever and
flu-like symptoms.</LD>
<LD>   With most areas of the county devoid of their own sources of
water, the scare showed this growing county's extreme vulnerability
to disruptions or quality problems in its flow of imported water.</LD>
<TE>   The county's water supply "continues to be safe," a visibly
relieved Chris Guild, deputy general manager of the water authority,
said late Wednesday as the new results taken from 30-plus sources
were released.</TE>
<TE>   The county buys 85% of its water from the Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California, more than any of the six counties
that depend on the mega-agency.</TE>
<TE>   Authority officials had advised the 23 member agencies,
particularly those without their own treatment systems, to consider
halting their purchases of water from the county supply after
Monday's routine tests at all 11 sites in the far-flung system were
positive.</TE>
<TE>   .</TE>
<TE>   But officials had been perplexed by the fact that other tests
showed that the water was clean when it was shipped southward by the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and clean after it
was distributed to the local agencies that serve the county's 2.7
million people.</TE>
<TE>   Believing that the 11 tests were false positives, officials
immediately ordered a new round of tests.</TE>
<TE>   The authority will continue probing to determine why the Monday
tests resulted in false positives, Guild said. A private firm does
the authority's monitoring.</TE>
<TE>   The water authority, which functions as a consortium, buys water
from the Metropolitan Water District and distributes it to the 23
agencies. Only a few of those agencies have their own estimable
sources of water. Just 15% of the county's water comes from local
sources such as wells or mountain runoff.</TE>
<TE>   Along with advising local agencies to consider suspending their
purchases, water authority officials had also stressed that the
bacteria discovered by the tests is not the deadly e-coli bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   Like many water districts, the San Diego authority increased
security measures after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Additional
patrols, cameras and testing procedures were established.</TE>
<TE>   The city of San Diego, the authority's largest customer, opted to
continue buying from the water authority. The city has an extensive
treatment system.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the districts that discontinued purchases are small
agricultural districts that either have their own wells or their own
storage capacity. The cities of Vista (population 60,000) and
Oceanside (160,000) also suspended purchases, relying on storage and
telling residents to reduce usage.</TE>
<TE>   Some farmers in the avocado-rich northern section of the county
stopped irrigating their fields. One small agricultural district
advised residential customers to boil their water.</TE>

<HD>College District Likely to Name Interim Leader</HD>
<DH>Ventura County: While a spending probe targets the
chancellor, officials say the job has been offered to a former head
of the system's Moorpark campus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV and AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Moorpark College President James Walker, who earned a
reputation for diplomacy with faculty union leaders, is expected to
be named today as acting chancellor of the troubled Ventura County
Community College District.</LD>
<LD>   The district's five-member board of trustees must appoint a
temporary replacement for Chancellor Philip Westin, placed on paid
administrative leave while the district investigates allegations he
misspent thousands of taxpayer dollars.</LD>
<LD>   Several district officials confirmed Wednesday that Walker, 66,
was offered the post and has accepted. Walker could not be reached
for comment.</LD>
<TE>   Walker retired July 1 after a decade at the helm of Moorpark
College. He served as interim district chancellor following the death
of Chancellor Thomas Lakin in late 1994. He served until Westin was
hired in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Miller, president of the Ventura County Federation of
College Teachers, said Walker's appointment would promote goodwill
between trustees and a faculty union distrustful of the current
administration.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't have an ego that requires feeding on an hourly basis,"
Miller said. "He would make an excellent chancellor and would treat
everyone fairly."</TE>
<TE>   Community activist David Maron said placing Westin on leave and
appointing a popular interim chancellor were positive steps but not
enough.</TE>
<TE>   "The community is holding its breath and waiting to see what the
board does," Maron said. "The community believes that putting him on
administrative leave is just the first step toward getting rid of
him, but we need to know that the board is not going to cower."</TE>
<TE>   Westin could not be reached for comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   If the board asks Westin to resign, his contract allows him to
collect 18 months' salary, or $305,000. Termination of the
chancellor's contract would have to come with Westin's consent,
unless the board could show cause, according to the college
district's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   To show cause, the board would have to prove one of the following:
that Westin violated his contract; failed to perform his duties
competently; had a physical or mental disability that prevented him
from performing his job; that he habitually neglected his duties; had
engaged in willful misconduct; or was convicted of a felony or any
crime involving moral turpitude.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks Westin has acknowledged poor judgment on some of
his expenditures and imposed voluntary limits on meals, but he has
repeatedly denied breaking any laws or knowingly violating district
policy. He has stated repeatedly he would not resign.</TE>
<TE>   Trustees planned to announce an acting chancellor at the
conclusion of a private meeting scheduled for this morning. They are
expected to begin the process of selecting an independent counsel and
an auditor to guide them through weeks of research that could help
determine Westin's fate.</TE>
<TE>   In coming weeks, trustees said, Westin will not be permitted to
enter his office. Meanwhile, investigators will have access to
Westin's files and computer equipment and are expected to interview
district employees, from administrators to secretaries to technology
experts.</TE>
<TE>   Westin has been under fire since March, when the Camarillo law
firm of Wood &amp; Bender presented trustees with a report detailing
$119,000 in expenses the chancellor charged the district between 1997
and 2001 for meals, travel, car maintenance, computer software and
other expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Trustees initially sought Westin's resignation. They changed
course after an auditor hired by the district said the expenses
appeared permissible. Westin alleged that one of the law firm's
partners, David Bender, had prepared the report in retaliation
because Westin would not steer lucrative legal work his way. Bender
has denied the allegation.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, trustees voted 4 to 1 in May to renew Westin's
contract through 2006 and grant him a $30,000 raise, bringing his
salary to $203,000. Trustee John Tallman cast the only dissenting
vote.</TE>

<HD>Woods Should Step Up to the Tee for Equality</HD>

<LD>Tiger Woods could have made history this week before he even stepped
to the first tee to take a swing at the third leg of the Grand Slam.</LD>
<LD>   He could have made his mark by not playing in the British Open to
protest host Muirfield golf club's exclusion of women. Even if all he
did was mention the possibility of not playing he would make a point.</LD>
<LD>   Remember the commotion he caused two years ago when he hinted that
he might sit out PGA Tour events because of clashes with Commissioner
Tim Finchem, including use of Woods' image in marketing campaigns?</LD>
<TE>   He told Golf World in a November 2000 issue that it was "serious
enough that if we don't make everyone aware of it now, it could
escalate into a bigger situation."</TE>
<TE>   Golf's discrimination against women, while hardly new, has
escalated into a bigger situation. First Augusta National Chairman
Hootie Johnson went public with his rebuff of a women's group
leader's request to add women members to the home of the Masters.
Then the world's best golfers arrived at Muirfield, which won't even
allow women in the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Woods looked back down the course at the Muirfield members, with
their 2 1/2 centuries of exclusionary history, and he decided to let
them play through.</TE>
<TE>   "They're entitled to set up their own rules the way they want
them," Woods said in a news conference this week. "It would be nice
to see everyone have an equal chance to participate if they wanted
to, but there's nothing you can do about it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate, but it's just the way it is."</TE>
<TE>   Just the way it is? There was a time when all of Woods'
considerable talents and skills wouldn't be enough to get him on the
PGA Tour or into Augusta National because that's just the way it was.</TE>
<TE>   And things stay just the way they are unless someone or something
acts on them.</TE>
<TE>   The founder of Shoal Creek Country Club in Birmingham, Ala., once
said that his club wouldn't be pressured into admitting African
American members because "that's just not done in Birmingham."</TE>
<TE>   Then the Southern Christian Leadership Conference called for a
boycott of the 1990 PGA Championship held at the course and TV
sponsors threatened to pull out of the telecasts. Presto, the club
gave an honorary membership to a local black businessman and the PGA
revamped its guidelines to avoid playing at any other clubs with
racially discriminatory policies. Later that year, Augusta National
just happened to accept its first African American member. Progress.</TE>
<TE>   It's not fair to expect athletes to be any more politically active
than you or me, just because they're wealthier and more famous. But
this issue happens to fall into Woods' corner of the world. It's a
place where his views are valid, and where they can have direct
impact. Equal access should be a top issue to this man of African and
Asian descent.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods doesn't have to be a Jackie Robinson or Muhammad Ali.
Right now, I'd be happy if he were just more like Ken Reeves.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, that Ken Reeves, the fictional basketball coach at Carver
High on "The White Shadow" TV series. I just happened to watch a
rerun on ESPN Classic Wednesday morning, and in that episode Reeves
took Coolidge, Thorpe and Salami for a round of golf at a country
club where his girlfriend's father had a membership.</TE>
<TE>   The starter took a look at Coolidge and Thorpe and told Reeves
that they couldn't play because the club had a no-minorities policy.
Reeves told the starter to tell it to the towering Coolidge himself.
The group then proceeded to their 9 a.m. tee time. Later, Reeves'
girlfriend's father asked them to leave the clubhouse restaurant
because they were violating the "rules." They left, but not before
Reeves took the father out to the balcony and called him a bigot.</TE>
<TE>   Reeves showed a lot more principle than Woods. So did Arnold
Palmer in 1990 when the Shoal Creek controversy raged.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are doing a public golf tournament, you bring the issue to
yourself," Palmer said. "If you have a golf tournament, you have to
let the general public in. Such a course must make memberships
available, no matter race or gender."</TE>
<TE>   Woods could make a stand just like that. That's all Martha Burk,
the head of the National Council of Women's Organizations, wants to
see from him.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not asking Tiger Woods to file a lawsuit," she told
Bloomberg News. "We'd just like to see a strong moral statement out
of him. If others before him hadn't stepped across the line on the
race issue, he would not be where he is today."</TE>
<TE>   There's an unfair burden on Woods to carry the flag for social
justice, because he has an unequal amount of clout on the golf scene.
He's fully aware of it, but he seems to flex on only the matters
closest to him. He piped up about marketing, and he reportedly
threatened to sit out one of those televised one-on-one showdowns a
couple years ago unless his caddy was allowed to wear shorts on a hot
day.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, these are private clubs, free to select or reject whomever
they want. It just isn't fair to exclude people based on gender.</TE>
<TE>   One of Woods' first Nike commercials featured young boys and girls
of all races proclaiming "I am Tiger Woods"--the message being that
because of Tiger, everyone was welcome to play.</TE>
<TE>   Earl Woods proclaimed that his son would be some combination of
Gandhi, Mandela and the Messiah, spreading racial harmony throughout
the world.</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, Woods never said any of this himself. But he sure has
profited from it. It's time to show he has learned from it.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, in that Golf World interview, Woods said: "I
believe in what I believe in. I understand the whole picture."</TE>

<LD>The Seattle Mariners feel right at home deep in the heart of Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Bret Boone and Mike Cameron homered, and the Mariners beat the
Texas Rangers, 6-3, Wednesday night for their eighth consecutive
victory at Arlington, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Seattle has won all five games in Texas this season, and 11 of 14
the last two seasons.</LD>
<TE>   "There's no rhyme or reason, we're just a team that seems to play
very well on the road," Boone said. "We just take the same approach
every game, and don't take any team for granted."</TE>
<TE>   The American League West-leading Mariners, who lost their two
games at Baltimore earlier this week, are 18 games ahead of the
last-place Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   Boone hit a solo homer in the second, a 406-foot drive to
right-center field that gave the Mariners a 1-0 lead. After Boone
drew a leadoff walk in the fourth, Cameron hit his 17th homer.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie Moyer (10-4) gave up two runs and four hits in 5 2/3
innings. He struck out four and gave up his first walk in four
starts.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a so-so performance," Moyer said. "I kept them off-balance
early."</TE>
<TE>   New York 2, Detroit 1--Jason Giambi and Jorge Posada lifted the
Yankees with run-scoring singles in the bottom of the ninth at New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Redman (5-9) had given up three hits through eight innings,
but gave up a leadoff double to Alfonso Soriano and walked Derek
Jeter.</TE>
<TE>   Bernie Williams popped out to shallow center before Giambi drove
in the tying run. After Raul Mondesi fouled out, Posada singled down
the left-field line to drive in Jeter.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 7, Baltimore 1--Roy Halladay (11-4) gave up one run and
five hits in eight innings, and Ken Huckaby hit an inside-the-park
home for host Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Vernon Wells hit a three-run homer and tied a career-high with
four runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   Huckaby hit a ball in the second inning that bounced in front of
diving right fielder Gary Matthews Jr., who thought it was foul and
took his time retrieving the ball as Huckaby rounded the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 6, Tampa Bay 1--Derek Lowe gave up two hits in eight
innings at St. Petersburg, Fla., and Manny Ramirez homered for the
second consecutive game for the Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe (13-5) retired nine in a row before Randy Winn doubled in the
fourth. Aubrey Huff doubled with two out to drive in Tampa Bay's run.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe struck out three and walked one to win for only the second
time in his last five decisions. He retired his last 11 batters and
didn't give up a hit after the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 8, Cleveland 5--Torii Hunter fired his own fastball back
at Indian pitcher Danys Baez after being drilled by a pitch at
Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter, angered at being hit in the left side, retaliated in the
fifth inning by picking up the ball and hitting Baez--about 40 feet
away--in the upper leg.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Thome hit his 28th homer for Cleveland, a two-run drive.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 8, Chicago 6--Brent Mayne went four for four with four
RBIs at Kansas City, Mo., and the Royals won their sixth consecutive
game.</TE>
<TE>   Mayne had a two-run single in the second and run-scoring singles
in the fourth and sixth innings. He tied his career high for hits.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Thomas was four for five with three doubles, one driving in
two runs against rookie reliever Ryan Bukvich that pulled Chicago
within two runs in the seventh.</TE>

<HD>Allen Running in Top Form</HD>
<DH>Track and field: Cal State Northridge sprinter improves
technique to become a top junior sprinter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rashaad Allen of Cal State Northridge credits improved running
technique for "95%" of his development into one of the nation's top
junior sprinters this season.</LD>
<LD>   There's no denying, however, that the disappointment of his senior
season at Oakland McClymonds High last year has contributed to his
success.</LD>
<LD>   Allen, who will begin his sophomore year at Northridge next month,
failed to advance to the state high school track and field
championships in the 100-meter dash last year. Yet he placed fifth in
the 100 in 10.39 seconds in the World Junior championships in
Kingston, Jamaica, on Wednesday after running 10.34, the fastest time
in his career, in a quarterfinal Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   The junior event is the highest level for athletes under 20 years
old.</TE>
<TE>   Allen had the fastest high school time in the state in the 100
during the start of his senior season with a 10.69 clocking. But an
upset loss to Garry Jones of Oakland Skyline in the Oakland Section
championships in May prevented him from advancing to the state
championships in the 100 for the third year in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent two or three years trying to lead up to the point where I
was going to be the top in the state and for me to not make it really
hurt," Allen said. "This whole season was about making sure that
never happened again."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, winning the U.S. junior title--as Allen did at
Stanford on June 22--was not among his goals at the start of the
season. He wanted to be Northridge's top sprinter and the best
freshman sprinter in the Big West Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Allen placed second in the 100 in the Big West championships in
May, but his breakthrough came in the U.S. junior championships when
he ran 10.39, then the best time of his career, to defeat a field
that included five sprinters who began the meet with faster all-time
bests.</TE>
<TE>   Allen never gave much thought to running mechanics in high school.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first came [to Northridge], I was just running off
whatever kind of talent I had," he said. "But once [Northridge
assistants Jeff McAuley and Rena Reider] helped me make some
technical changes, I realized it makes a big difference in how you
run."</TE>
<TE>   McAuley says that the 5-foot-10, 160-pound Allen had a graceful,
flowing running style in high school, but his long stride was better
suited to a quarter-miler than a sprinter.</TE>
<TE>   "We just had to get him to take shorter, quicker, more powerful
strides," McAuley said. "We figured that once he did that, his times
would start to drop."</TE>

<HD>Time Is Right for Fabregas</HD>
<DH>Angels: Backup catcher, playing only because Molina is
injured, drives in two runs in 10-4 victory over the A's.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>If it were Tuesday, Jorge Fabregas would not have been playing.</LD>
<LD>   And in almost any other situation, he might not have been hitting.</LD>
<LD>   But, with starting catcher Bengie Molina put on the disabled list
before the game and his brother, triple-A catcher Jose Molina, en
route from Nebraska, Angel Manager Mike Scioscia had no choice but to
let his backup catcher hit in a critical situation Wednesday night.
So Fabregas, whose batting average was one out away from falling
below .200, singled home the winning runs in a 10-4 victory over the
Oakland Athletics.</LD>
<TE>   Had the Angels lost, they would have fallen into third place in
the American League West for the first time since May 8. But, with
their casualty list growing on a seemingly daily basis and their
general manager so far unable to procure reinforcements, the
resilient Angel players shrugged and won the first in a critical
11-game stretch against Oakland and the first-place Seattle Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   They trail the Mariners by three games and lead the A's by one. In
the wild-card race, they trail the Boston Red Sox by a half-game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's how you persevere and how you come through the tough times
that makes a champion," Fabregas said. "Troy [Percival] is down.
Bengie is down. The guys are looking to you to step up."</TE>
<TE>   The A's had won 15 of their last 18 games against the Angels;
Oakland starter Tim Hudson had a seven-game winning streak against
the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   No matter. Fabregas singled home two runs in the decisive sixth
inning, giving him his first two-RBI game of the year on one swing.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't replace Bengie. He's an extremely clutch hitter,"
Fabregas said. "Maybe hitting in his spot rubbed off on me."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels batted around in the sixth inning and again in the
eighth. David Eckstein hit a three-run homer and Garret Anderson hit
a two-run homer, and Adam Kennedy and Scott Spiezio had three hits
apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Appier held the A's to three runs over six innings, with
Brendan Donnelly, Scott Schoeneweis and Scot Shields handling the
final three innings.</TE>
<TE>   Center fielder Darin Erstad, sidelined by an infected foot,
watched from the bench. So did Molina. Three relievers who might have
appeared Wednesday--Percival, Al Levine and Dennis Cookpreceded
Molina onto the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels collected 15 hits. Everyone in the lineup had at least
one, with the exception of Brad Fullmer, who walked and was hit by a
pitch. Eckstein, the Angels' leadoff hitter, reached base five
times--on the home run, a single, two walks and an error.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels got five hits in the decisive sixth inning, but the
batter who did not get a hit might have been the most valuable.</TE>
<TE>   With the Angels down, 3-2, Anderson doubled to start the inning.
Troy Glaus struck out; he struck out in all three at-bats against
Hudson.</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer then drew a walk, but not before apparently exhausting
Hudson by working the count full, then fouling off three pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Did that tire out Hudson? Sure seemed to, because the next three
batters rocked him for hits, and he was gone.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio doubled in Anderson with the tying run.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had no left-handed hitters available to bat for
Fabregas, and besides they preferred not to have utilityman Shawn
Wooten catch the final four innings. So Fabregas, with a .200 average
at the time, was allowed to hit.</TE>
<TE>   And hit he did. He singled home Fullmer and Spiezio, giving the
Angels a 5-3 lead. Kennedy singled too, and Hudson departed. He had
made 100 pitches without surviving the sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Whether he might have batted for Fabregas had the Angels had a
full roster, Scioscia suggested, was hypothetical. What was not,
Scioscia said, was the terrific job Fabregas did in guiding Appier.</TE>
<TE>   "Jorge called an excellent game, and that's what we need from
him," Scioscia said. "If he can catch the way he did, that's
something we'll desperately need."</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Molina's Injury Could Hurt the Most</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>The Angels' latest injury could be their most severe. Catcher Bengie
Molina could be out until Sept. 1 because of a partially torn left
hamstring, sending General Manager Bill Stoneman scrambling to
investigate whether he should trade for a catcher as well as a relief
pitcher.</LD>
<LD>   Molina suffered the injury while batting Tuesday in his first game
after missing three because of a mild strain in the same hamstring.
Athletic trainer Ned Bergert said the injuries were not related.
Bergert also said the latest injury, diagnosed after an MRI
examination Wednesday, was as severe as the right hamstring injury
that sidelined Molina for seven weeks last season.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels put Molina on the disabled list and recalled his
younger brother from triple-A Salt Lake. Jose Molina was batting .307
at Salt Lake and batted .270 in 15 games with the Angels last season.
Manager Mike Scioscia said Jose and Jorge Fabregas would split most
of the catching duties, with Shawn Wooten also available.</LD>
<TE>   "We feel we have guys that can come in on a short-term basis and
do the job," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Bengie's batting average had fallen from .326 on May 2 to .268,
but he led major league catchers by throwing out 46% of runners
trying to steal and worked extremely well with the pitchers. Stoneman
said that several other clubs had expressed interest in trading for
Jose this season and said he was unsure he could trade for anyone
better.</TE>
<TE>   "If somebody's available that can be a reasonable upgrade at a
reasonable cost, we'll look at it, but it's hard to get catching at
any time of the year," Stoneman said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' tastes, then, would lean more to a catcher such as
Brent Mayne of the Kansas City Royals than Ivan Rodriguez of the
Texas Rangers or Jason Kendall of the Pittsburgh Pirates.</TE>
<TE>   On this trip, the Angels have put Bengie Molina, closer Troy
Percival and reliever Dennis Cook on the disabled list, and Scioscia
said outfielder Darin Erstad might be unavailable for several more
days because of a foot infection. As the Angels battle their division
rivals with a depleted roster, the remaining sound players would
celebrate if Stoneman could make a deal.</TE>
<TE>   "You always think they're looking for ways to improve the club,"
outfielder Tim Salmon said. "There's no doubt we've had some bad
news. It would be nice to hear something good."</TE>
<TE>   Molina, 27, never played more than 108 games in any of his seven
minor league seasons, often slowed by injury. He played 130 games in
his rookie season with the Angels two years ago, batting .281 with 14
home runs. The Angels then signed him to a four-year, $4.25-million
contract; he has been injured in each of the two seasons since.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels would be thrilled if Cook could return by Sept. 1, but
they're not counting on it. Still, Cook said he feels obligated to
try to rehabilitate the torn labrum and partially torn rotator cuff
in his pitching shoulder. He originally told doctors he would opt for
surgery on Friday, which would have ended his season, but changed his
mind and decided to take a chance on rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   "The more I thought about it, these guys are paying me to try to
pitch this year, not to try to fix it for next year," he said. "Plus,
we're winning, and I want to be a part of it as much as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Cook, 39, also said he would defer any decision about retirement.
He signed a $1.25-million contract with the Angels last winter and
had been leaning toward retirement after the season.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two children of Ted Williams who want his body kept frozen are
trying again to reach a compromise with their half sister, who says
the baseball great should be cremated.</LD>
<LD>   John Henry Williams and his sister, Claudia, asked a Florida state
court judge Wednesday to order a mediation session with their half
sister, Bobby-Jo Williams Ferrell. They hope to avoid a public
showdown in court.</LD>
<LD>   "John Henry and Claudia feel strongly that the disposition of
their father's body is a private matter," their attorney, Robert
Goldman, said in the motion.</LD>
<TE>   Williams died July 5. He was 83.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' children already have tried mediation, negotiating for
hours Monday, but were unable to reach agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrell's attorney, Richard Fitzpatrick, said an agreement is
possible.</TE>
<TE>   "There's middle ground everywhere," Fitzpatrick said. "Now this is
a very difficult case to find that--I agree with that--but I'm not
about to say there's no possibility that there couldn't be any middle
ground."</TE>
<TE>   Ferrell has accused John Henry Williams of sending their father's
body to the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Arizona so he could
profit off their father's remains or sell his DNA.</TE>
<TE>   "One point should be made clear," Goldman said at a news
conference. "Claudia and John Henry Williams will never profit off of
their father's body or the disposition of their father's remains."</TE>
<TE>   If no agreement is reached, a judge could decide whether Williams
wanted to be frozen or cremated. The Hall of Fame outfielder's will
and the executor of his estate present conflicting accounts of his
intentions.</TE>
<TE>   In the will that was filed and made public Tuesday, Williams said
he wanted his ashes "sprinkled at sea off the coast of Florida where
the water is very deep."</TE>
<TE>   Williams also specified he didn't want a funeral or memorial
service.</TE>
<TE>   But executor Albert Cassidy said that after Williams wrote his
will Dec. 20, 1996, he expressed a desire to have his body frozen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   George Steinbrenner responded to charges from Cleveland owner
Larry Dolan that the New York Yankees are to blame for baseball's
economic problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Since the day that Babe Ruth was acquired, the Yankees have been
the envy of many in the game and subject to the jealousies that
success brings," Steinbrenner, the Yankee owner, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "In reality, it is the Yankees' success and commitment to
providing a consistent winner that is at the center of the
criticism."</TE>
<TE>   Dolan said Tuesday the Yankees, whose payroll is about $135
million, are forcing other teams to overspend so they can compete.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay put pitcher Wilson Alvarez on the 15-day disabled list
because of left elbow tendinitis. Alvarez is in the final season of a
$35-million, five-year contract. He sat out the last two seasons
because of a left rotator cuff injury.... Atlanta activated Marcus
Giles from the 15-day disabled list and optioned him to triple-A
Richmond. Giles was the Braves' starter at second base before he
sprained his right ankle May 28.... Chicago Cub catcher Joe Girardi
went on the disabled list for the first time since 1994. He has a
strained rib cage muscle.... Cincinnati right-hander Joey Hamilton,
who hasn't pitched since July 7, went on the 15-day disabled list
because of a strained left hamstring.</TE>

<LD>Who is baseball's greatest living player?</LD>
<LD>   The recent death of Ted Williams--three years after the death of
Joe DiMaggio--has renewed an old argument. Among those frequently
mentioned are Hank Aaron, Frank Robinson, Pete Rose, Stan Musial,
George Brett, Barry Bonds and Rickey Henderson.</LD>
<LD>   But they all fall in line behind Willie Mays, based on a survey of
baseball historians, executives and current and former players
conducted by the Bloomberg News Service.</LD>
<TE>   Historian Ken Shouler narrowly picks Mays over Aaron because of
his superior overall game.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you allow that the offensive numbers are essentially
identical, the argument ends," Shouler said. "Mays goes ahead of
Aaron on the strength of being a far greater fielder and baserunner."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1970, Mays bounced hit No. 3,000
through the left side of the infield off Mike Wegener in the second
inning of the San Francisco Giants' 10-1 victory over the Montreal
Expos.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the only major league player with 3,000 hits,
300 home runs, 600 doubles, 100 triples and 200 stolen bases? Hint:
He's from Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong answer: Jay Mariotti of the Chicago Sun-Times writes that
Allen Iverson's image has taken a beating with his recent arrest:</TE>
<TE>   "And to think they marketed him as a misunderstood bad boy, an
edgy street hero trying his best to get along in society. Turns out
Iverson wasn't 'The Answer' as much as The Lie....</TE>
<TE>   "There will never be answers here, only questions. Such as: Why
would anyone, including the NBA commissioner, want anything more to
do with this creep?"</TE>
<TE>   Bud not wiser: Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle, taking
yet another shot at baseball Commissioner Bud Selig: "A tie All-Star
game? This never would've happened if Kenesaw Mountain Landis' kids
had thought to save some DNA....</TE>
<TE>   "A solution that should have occurred to baseball's brain trust:
While Selig was slowly sorting his options, freeze all the players,
then bring 'em back to life after Bud's had time to consult me."</TE>
<TE>   Golden (Bear) era: During an 18-year span, Jack Nicklaus won the
British Open three times, was second a record seven times and never
finished lower than 12th.</TE>
<TE>   By the numbers:  From the Caught on the Fly column in the Sporting
News: "The stat column to watch for the Bravos, BoSox and Dodgers is
IP, as in how much Atlanta's no-name 'pen, Derek Lowe and Odalis
Perez have to punch clock during the second half after throwin' much,
much more than usual in the first."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: El Segundo's George Brett.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: When forward Carlos Boozer played for Duke, it was
widely reported that his father, also named Carlos, had played on
Maryland's basketball team with John Lucas.</TE>
<TE>   But after the Cleveland Cavaliers, coached by Lucas, drafted
Boozer, his dad acknowledged that he only played in pick-up games
with Lucas at Maryland and was never a member of the basketball team.</TE>
<TE>   "After a while, the stories started that I played with John, and I
kind of let it go," Boozer Sr. told the Akron Beacon Journal. "I'm
kind of embarrassed about it."</TE>

<KH>THE BRITISH OPEN Today-Sunday at Muirfield Course, Scotland</KH>
<HD>Two Legs Up</HD>
<DH>With Slam in sight, Woods' biggest competition on his road
to historic victory might come from himself</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GULLANE, Scotland</DL>
<LD>Tiger Woods continues his assault on golf's major championships today
at 9:01 a.m., Grand Slam Time.</LD>
<LD>   There will be 155 other golfers teeing off at historic Muirfield
as well, some simply overjoyed to be part of the world's oldest, and
some say most prestigious, golf tournament, others intent on
preventing Woods from repeating the victories he already has this
year in the other two majors--the Masters and U.S. Open.</LD>
<LD>   But once the final putt is stroked over the rolling greens of this
7,034-yard, par-71 links layout late Sunday afternoon, the player who
will have the most to say about who lifts the Claret Jug is Woods.</LD>
<TE>   If he plays as he did during his three-stroke victories at Augusta
in April and at Bethpage in June, even the world's top golfers
acknowledge that keeping the world's No. 1 player from his second
British Open championship might be nearly impossible.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, we hope Tiger doesn't perform, and then we all will have an
opportunity," said Scotland favorite son Colin Montgomerie, whose
disappointing performance in 12 British Opens includes only one
top-10 finish and five missed cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "But if he plays the way he has been, we all believe that the
opportunity won't arise."</TE>
<TE>   Woods has won eight majors, seven of the last 11, and when he
plays well enough in the early rounds to sniff the winner's check, he
wins. He has never lost a major while playing in the final group on
Sunday and has won 24 of 26 times on the PGA Tour when leading after
the third round.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, whose tee time is 1:01 a.m. (PDT), will be playing
competitively for the first time since his U.S. Open victory June 16,
a layoff that might offer some hope to his more optimistic
competitors, but that worries Woods less than a tap-in birdie.</TE>
<TE>   "I was playing well," he said. "I'm hitting the golf ball right
now; I don't foresee it to be a problem."</TE>
<TE>   The course is soft and lush this year, a function of one of the
rainiest summers in 40 years. It rained 26 days in June and drizzled
continually during practice rounds Tuesday and Wednesday, which means
the greens are not yet firm and fast, and balls will not roll
unchecked through hard-pan fairways into the rough or one of the 148
bunkers on this 111-year-old layout.</TE>
<TE>   The rough is knee high just off the fairways and around the
greens, and so deep in some places that Ian Woosnam could put on a
camouflage rain suit and hide undetected in there for a fortnight.</TE>
<TE>   Winning this week will be impossible for anyone who can't keep his
tee shots in the fairway, though because of the moderate length, 200
yards shorter than at Bethpage, most players will play for position
rather than distance and hit their drivers only a handful of times
each round.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to keep the ball out of the bunkers, as well as the
rough," Woods said. "because it is a penalty for going in them."</TE>
<TE>   Only Ben Hogan, in 1953, has won the first three majors of the
year, but because the British Open and PGA Championship overlapped at
that time, he never had the opportunity to try for the Grand Slam.
The PGA this year , is at Hazeltine in Chaska, Minn., in August.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Nicklaus was the last player to win the first two majors of
the year, then came to Muirfield for the 1972 Open and lost to Lee
Trevino. The big question this week is whether there is a Trevino in
the 2002 field.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Mickelson is the world's No. 2 player. He was third in the
Masters, second in the U.S. Open and is the last person to win a tour
event that Woods led after three rounds--the 2000 Players
Championship.</TE>
<TE>   "Phil shot even par on Sunday of the U.S. Open and that's not easy
to do," Woods said. "I was just able to outlast him because I had a
bigger lead."</TE>
<TE>   Because Mickelson's record in the British Open has been the worst
of all four majors--he has never finished higher than 11th in nine
tries--the left-hander has spent more than a year refining his game
specifically for this event.</TE>
<TE>   He has worked hard on taking spin off his low shots, so they can
get more roll, and on putting in the wind, two elements important to
links golf he thinks might make all the difference here.</TE>
<TE>   "Without a doubt, I feel I'm more prepared than I have been for
this event," he said. "This is by far my best chance."</TE>
<TE>   And he says he is one player who's looking forward to squaring off
against Woods on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the feeling of playing in the last round or coming down
the stretch having a chance to win," he said. "That nervousness, that
excitement that goes through my mind and body; that opportunity to
compete is what I love so much."</TE>
<TE>   David Duval, the defending champion, won his first major at Royal
Lytham in 2001, played with moderate success the rest of the year but
has virtually disappeared in 2002. He has missed three consecutive
cuts and five of the last seven, which is reason enough for the
British bookmakers to make him a longshot to become the first repeat
winner since Tom Watson in 1982-83.</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Garcia, who won the British Amateur at Muirfield four years
ago, played in the final pairing with Woods in the U.S. Open but
slipped to a four-over 74 that left him in fourth place. He finished
ninth last year at Lytham.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my game is there. I think I play well enough," Garcia
said of his chances of winning. "But to win a major, it's not enough
playing well. You have to have good breaks at the right time ...</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of good players out there who can win and can
beat him [Woods]. He just somehow manages to hang in there and not
make many mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Els finished third last year, second in 2000 and was fifth
at Muirfield in 1992, but he has been struggling lately.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to play a lot better," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Two-time British Open champion Greg Norman says he wouldn't be
playing here this week if he didn't think he could win, though he
hasn't won a tour event since 1997. Nick Faldo won the Open the last
two times it was played at Muirfield, in '92 and '87, and has begun
to find the game that had deserted him the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   But however most of the golfers perform in the next four rounds,
it all boils down to one player.</TE>
<TE>   "He's mentally strong. He's not worried about competition," Faldo
said of Woods. "Tiger is definitely a step above everybody else."</TE>

<AU>MIKE JAMES and THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>GULLANE, Scotland</DL>
<LD>Phil Mickelson is the world's No. 2 player, coming off a victory at
Hartford and a winner of 21 PGA Tour events. He has plenty of money,
a loving family, good looks and a golf game that's second to, well,
one.</LD>
<LD>   To unseat Tiger Woods, at least occasionally, he says he has had
to toss aside the philosophy set by the man with the most major
championships in history--Jack Nicklaus.</LD>
<LD>   "I have listened to Nicklaus talk over the course of his career
and somewhat tried to buy into his theory of stay near the lead, just
kind of hang in there, and let the leaders come back on Sunday," he
said. "And that has not worked for me, because Tiger hasn't come
back.</LD>
<TE>   "So I have to approach the first three rounds now in a different
light ... try to vault into the lead early....</TE>
<TE>   "To have a chance on Sunday, I need to be right there heading into
the final day."</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson shot an even-par 70 in the final round of the U.S. Open
to Woods' 72, but still lost to Woods by three.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been difficult for Nicklaus to equate how he played majors
30 years ago and how they're played today, and his style and why his
style is no longer effective," Mickelson said.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't apply to the game anymore. So you have to look at a
different style to win majors, a more attacking, aggressive style to
compete against somebody that doesn't make mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   That aggressive style at Muirfield, as he tries to win his first
major championship and keep Woods from taking the third leg of the
Grand Slam this week in the British Open, won't come from the tee
boxes, but, he hopes, from the fairways.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson, like virtually every other player in the 156-man field,
says he'll be hitting two-irons, three-irons, even four-irons off
many tees to set himself up, then go after the pins</TE>
<TE>   "There are many pins that you can get to; the front of the greens
are all open, so you can bounce shots up and get them close," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as I put the ball in the fairway, then I can attack. I
would say I want to play attacking golf from the tee, which means not
necessarily hitting driver. It means positioning myself in the
fairway to where I can attack the pin. And that's the way I see
Muirfield being played."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson, who had never played Muirfield, arrived Saturday and
played 54 holes over the weekend. "It's probably my favorite course
in the rotation," he said of the eight or so regular British Open
courses.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The forecast calls for mild weather for the first few days of the
tournament, then the possibility of northerly winds on the weekend.
Of course, with the weather so variable off the Firth of Forth, that
can change in a second. There was little mention of rain before
Tuesday or Wednesday, but there was a constant drizzle both days.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Only two holes were changed from the 1992 Open at Muirfield, the
fourth and 13th. Each par-three was lengthened about 30 yards.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michael Campbell, who won the European Open two weeks ago and was
sixth last week at the Scottish Open, may be someone to watch at
Muirfield. Campbell, 33, challenged for the 1995 British Open title
at St. Andrews, where he had a 65 on Saturday, but tied for third
when he closed with a 76.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm definitely a better player than I was seven years ago," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Tiger is always up there and has a very good show of winning
again, but this golf course is suited to many other players, unlike
Bethpage and Augusta. Muirfield is around 300 yards shorter than
those courses and the nature of this course and the shots you have to
play--as opposed to Bethpage, a big-hitter's course--will bring into
the equation about 60 guys that can win this tournament."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   His back has not bothered him, so Colin Montgomerie says he is
healthy as he tries for the 15th time to win the British Open. The
closest he came was in 1994, when he tied for eighth at Turnberry,
but Montgomerie tied for 13th last year at Lytham and that's his
second best result.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie says he had a chance last year when Woods didn't play
well and tied for 25th.</TE>
<TE>   "I think David Duval took that opportunity with Tiger not
performing last year. It was an opportunity for everybody. [Duval]
took it. I didn't."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Padraig Harrington offered an interesting opinion on why the
so-called name players have seldom been able to knock off Woods
head-to-head.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the guys who have beaten Tiger in the past tend to be
guys who have grown up or performed most of their golfing career as
underdogs, so they're used to that situation," Harrington said.</TE>
<TE>   He listed Billy Mayfair as an example. Mayfair defeated Woods in a
playoff to win the 1998 Nissan Open at Valencia Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obviously tougher for guys who are always the top dog to
have the role reversed and to be the underdog coming up against
Tiger. They are not familiar with that situation."</TE>
<TE>   Harrington, three strokes behind Woods after 36 holes at the U.S.
Open, was paired with him in the third round, but he staggered to a
73-75 weekend and finished nine shots behind.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The head of the National Council of Women's Organizations criticized
golfer Tiger Woods for not speaking out against private golf clubs
that don't have women members.</LD>
<LD>   Martha Burk said Wednesday she was disappointed by Woods'
statement that "there's nothing you can do" to force all-male clubs
to open their doors to women.</LD>
<LD>   The clubs include Augusta National, home of the Masters, and
Muirfield, site of this week's British Open.</LD>
<TE>   "At some point, I hope that there is more than one golfer that has
the courage to speak out for those that are being excluded," said
Burk, whose Washington-based organization has more than 160 women's
groups.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Falling and Can't Get Up</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Padres' Lawrence gives up four hits in 7-0
victory. Perez can't get out of the sixth inning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Until Wednesday night, the Dodgers' second-half stumbles could be
rationalized because their mounting losses came against two of the
top teams in the National League.</LD>
<LD>   The defending World Series champion Arizona Diamondbacks are in
first place in the NL West and the St. Louis Cardinals lead the NL
Central.</LD>
<LD>   But the San Diego Padres have the second-worst record in the
National League and the fourth-worst record in the major leagues at
38-56.</LD>
<TE>   No matter.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Lawrence and the cellar-dwelling Padres shut out the
Dodgers, 7-0, before 33,778 at Dodger Stadium, extending the Dodgers'
losing streak to three games.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who were blanked for the 10th time this season, are
now 1-6 since the All-Star break. They have lost seven of their last
eight games and nine of their last 12.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no getting around the fact that right now we're in a
rut," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's loss dropped the Dodgers 1 1/2 games behind the
Diamondbacks, who defeated the Colorado Rockies. The San Francisco
Giants pulled to within a half-game of the Dodgers with a victory
over the Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   "The two clubs that we're involved with in our division, believe
me, they are not going to wait around--and we wouldn't do it either
if we were the club playing great baseball," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodger offense has not even been adequate since the All-Star
break. They had only four hits against Lawrence and have scored only
16 runs in the second half. They have scored two runs or fewer in
five of their last six games.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Lo Duca had three of the Dodgers' hits against Lawrence, who
struck out seven and pitched the second shutout of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger first baseman Eric Karros batted fourth and was hitless in
four at-bats, meaning Dodger cleanup hitters are one for 24 since the
All-Star break and five for 44 since July 2.</TE>
<TE>   "They're struggling a little bit and maybe they're a little
overanxious to get back on the right track," said Lawrence, who
retired the last 11 batters. "Maybe they swung at some bad pitches
and helped me out a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers had hoped that Odalis Perez could help them break
through their troubles. The 24-year-old left-hander came within an
out of shutout when he beat the Padres, 4-1, on April 21 at Dodger
Stadium, a performance that fueled his run to his first All-Star Game
selection.</TE>
<TE>   He gave up nine hits in six innings in a 3-2 loss against the
Diamondbacks on Friday with the runs coming on two home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Perez was victimized by the homer again Wednesday and lost for the
third time in his last four decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Kotsay and Julius Matos led off the third inning with singles
and Perez fell behind in the count, 3-and-0, to No. 3 hitter Phil
Nevin. The former Cal State Fullerton star received the green light
and hammered Perez's next pitch into the left-field pavilion for his
sixth homer and a 3-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Perez got through the fourth and fifth unscathed, but gave up a
single to Ryan Klesko and a double to Ron Gant to start the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Perez held the runners on a ground ball by Brian Buchanan and
walked No. 7 hitter Deivi Cruz intentionally to load the bases, but
Wiki Gonzalez made the Dodgers pay by hitting a fly ball that bounced
over the head of left fielder Brian Jordan and into the bleachers for
a two-run double.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Mulholland replaced Perez and struck out Lawrence, but
Kotsay singled up the middle to drive in two runs and give the Padres
a 7-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "That was really bad outing," said Perez (10-6), who gave up nine
hits and struck out six in 5 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence, meanwhile, was never really challenged, which did not
come as a complete surprise to the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   On April 14, Lawrence gave up four hits in seven shutout innings
in a 1-0 victory at Qualcomm Stadium. Five days later, he gave up
three runs and five hits in seven innings of a 5-2 loss at Dodger
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Lawrence (8-5) dealt the Dodgers their first shutout
since they were blanked, 7-0, by the Angels on June 29.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, everybody is just sitting back waiting for something
to happen," Jordan said. "We've been successful by putting pressure
on teams. Right now, we're not doing that."</TE>

<HD>The Fundamental Things Still Apply</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dodger pitchers say it was a coincidence, but more than four hours
before Wednesday night's series opener against the San Diego Padres
the majority of the staff was fielding bunts and ground balls from
Dodger coaches and throwing to various bases in a drill that is a
staple of spring training.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers lost to the St. Louis Cardinals the day before in a
game that featured an errant throw to third base by right-hander
Hideo Nomo on a bunt. It was a two-run error that triggered a
three-run inning and an eventual 9-2 defeat.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward, Manager Jim Tracy implored his team to execute the
fundamentals as they had during the first half.</LD>
<TE>   Wednesday's bunt-fielding session, however, apparently was not a
result of that meeting. Coach Jim Riggleman said it was arranged
informally after reliever Terry Mulholland asked if he could get some
extra work.</TE>
<TE>   "The last few weeks, when I've fielded ground balls, my throws
have been high or wide so I just wanted to get back to feeling
comfortable out there," said Mulholland, who pitched 1 1/3 scoreless
innings Tuesday and 2 2/3 scoreless innings Wednesday. "When Darren
[Dreifort] heard I was going to get some early work, he asked if he
could join in.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Nomo he could come if he wanted to and the rest of the
guys who were here early decided to get into it too. It wasn't
mandatory or anything. It was just good to see everyone working hard
to stay sharp."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dreifort is scheduled to pitch another simulated game on Friday as
he continues his comeback from elbow surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Dreifort, who threw 34 pitches over two simulated innings Monday,
will increase his pitch count, but Tracy said the number had not yet
been established.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy also said that Dreifort's role when he returns has not been
determined. The Dodgers, however, will increase his pitch counts
during simulated games and a rehabilitation assignment as if he was a
starter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   James Loney, the Dodgers' first-round pick in the June draft, is
batting .367 with four homers and 22 runs batted in through 27 games
for Great Falls in the Pioneer Rookie League.</TE>
<TE>   Loney, a first baseman, signed for $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Miller, a supplemental first-round pick who signed for about
$1.2 million, had a 1.29 earned-run average in seven innings over
three appearances for Great Falls before his second start Wednesday
night against Ogden.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Not Looking for Help From Outside</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Despite recent slump, players feel confident they
have the parts to contend for a postseason berth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers insist everything is fine despite their post-All-Star
game slump that has turned up the heat at Chavez Ravine.</LD>
<LD>   Going 1-6 out of the break is not the textbook way to build
second-half momentum, and the Arizona Diamondbacks and San Francisco
Giants have fared better recently in the tight National League West
race. Still, the Dodgers believe they are well positioned after
exceeding their expectations to this point, figuring they should
qualify for the playoffs as long as they stick together and play it
cool.</LD>
<LD>   Playing better would also help, but the last-place San Diego
Padres took the opener of a two-game series, 7-0, Wednesday night
before 33,778 at Dodger Stadium. The Dodgers are not expected to make
a major trade before the July 31 non-waiver deadline, and players are
not looking for outside help.</LD>
<TE>   "Everyone knows that we haven't been playing good baseball the
last week, but you've got to overcome a little adversity if you're
going to be a team that does anything," right fielder Shawn Green
said. "We've got a good enough team in this clubhouse to get the job
done, and we've shown that over the first half of the season. It's
just going to be a matter of the guys who had good first halves to
keep it up, and the guys who played under their expectations to get
back to form.</TE>
<TE>   "It's understandable that fans would look at [the last seven
games] and think that we need to make a move. You could understand if
they figured we needed to add something to help right now. When you
look at a team like the [New York] Yankees, that has an unlimited
supply of money and minor league players to do things, it's a natural
response for fans to expect that. But that's not the situation in
most of baseball, and that's not our situation."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have lacked the prospects to acquire premier players
in trades for many seasons, and baseball officials said little has
changed. Even if the farm system was teeming with talent in double-
and triple-A, teams are not interested in the players General Manager
Dan Evans wants to trade to bolster the 25-man roster and trim a
bloated payroll.</TE>
<TE>   Evans inquired about New York Met third baseman Edgardo Alfonzo,
who can become a free agent at the end of the season. But third
baseman Adrian Beltre would have to be included in a deal for
Alfonzo, as well as other impact players, and the Dodgers are not
willing to give up on Beltre, 23, despite his subpar season.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Evans doesn't understand what all the fuss is about.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the same team that, a week ago, everybody was extolling
as one of the great surprises in the National League," he said.
"We're not looking at this seven-game string and discounting what
happened the previous 85 or 90 games.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the people who are complaining now are a lot of people
who were complaining when we were 0-3. They're overreacting to a
minor part of the schedule."</TE>
<TE>   Said first baseman Eric Karros: "We've put ourselves in a
situation where things become magnified."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Manager Jim Tracy continues to accentuate the
positive.</TE>
<TE>   "This club is going to bounce back, that's what I'm very confident
in, and what that correlates to remains to be seen," he said. "There
are three clubs that are in heated competition in the framework of
our division, but our club will bounce back. It's a [seven]-game
stretch where we've won a ballgame, and every club goes through that.</TE>
<TE>   "It's that imaginary wall that you don't see, and for whatever
reason, you run into it. We're not the only ones it's going to happen
to. We've hit a stumbling block here, obviously, and we lead the wild
card and we're only [1 1/2 games] out in the division."</TE>
<TE>   But players take a different view, saying they expect skepticism
from fans after the chaos of the last few seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "We've put [fans] on a roller-coaster ride the last few seasons,
so everybody is going to end up panicking," catcher Paul Lo Duca
said. "But really, the only thing that concerns most of the guys is
that we're going to try too hard. If we try to do too much, then
we're not going to win."</TE>

<DH>Mosley adopts an angry attitude for his welterweight title
rematch with Forrest</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>A short but powerful summer storm swept through this city Wednesday
morning, venting its fury against all that stood in its path. The
rain, pelting the window of Shane Mosley's room in a downtown
high-rise hotel, served as a perfect backdrop for the mood of the
former boxing champion as he discussed Saturday's welterweight title
rematch against Vernon Forrest at Conseco Fieldhouse.</LD>
<LD>   Mosley wore his trademark smile, but beneath the surface, and not
very far beneath it at that, there also is a storm raging, fueled by
anger and frustration over his loss to Forrest in January.</LD>
<LD>   Mosley, gracious and easy going until the defeat, says no mas.</LD>
<TE>   "I am too nice a guy," he said. "But this [defeat] has opened my
eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Like the storm outside, Mosley was venting his fury at all sorts
of targets in his path, zeroing in on:</TE>
<TE>   * Forrest, whom he accused of beating him in the Theater at
Madison Square Garden in New York with an illegal head butt, which,
Mosley claims, Forrest was secretly taught by a former trainer of
Evander Holyfield.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not right for him to boast that he beat Shane Mosley," the
Pomona fighter said of Forrest, "when he didn't beat me the right
way, with class and honor. How can you feel good about something you
didn't earn?"</TE>
<TE>   * Cedric Kushner, Mosley's former promoter, who Mosley said still
owes him $600,000 from the first fight against Forrest.</TE>
<TE>   * Lou DiBella, an advisor to Forrest who is telling anyone and
everyone he meets that Forrest will knock Mosley out Saturday. Mosley
called DiBella a fair-weather advisor who will be back in his camp
after he emerges victorious.</TE>
<TE>   Few outside the Forrest camp had any doubt Mosley would emerge
victorious in the first fight. He entered the ring 38-0 with 35
knockouts, had won the International Boxing Federation lightweight
title, successfully defended it eight times, then moved up two weight
classes and beat Oscar De La Hoya for the World Boxing Council
welterweight crown two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Mosley defended that title three times before Forrest took it from
him by unanimous decision.</TE>
<TE>   Although he is 34-0 with 26 knockouts, Forrest has never enjoyed
the acclaim of Mosley, who was at or near the top of most lists of
the best pound-for-pound fighters until January. Forrest won the IBF
welterweight championship with a decision over Raul Frank last year.</TE>
<TE>   Against Mosley, whom he also had beaten in their amateur days,
Forrest gained the edge after a second-round head butt, knocked
Mosley down twice in that round and won a clear decision.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, in the ring and in the ensuing months, Mosley was the
perfect gentleman. He complimented Forrest, conceded he was the
better man that night and campaigned hard for a rematch.</TE>
<TE>   But Mosley said that all changed when he began working with a
former Forrest sparring partner, whom Mosley refused to identify.</TE>
<TE>   One day at Mosley's Big Bear training site, the sparring partner
told him the head butt was a planned tactic, according to Mosley.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you talking about?" Mosley asked the sparring partner.</TE>
<TE>   "He did it on purpose. They practiced that," the sparring partner
replied, according to Mosley, going on to describe secret
head-butting sessions staged for Holyfield and other Atlanta-area
fighters by a trainer Mosley said has since died.</TE>
<TE>   According to Mosley, Forrest would throw his left jab outside to
force Mosley to go to his right. If Mosley moved too far right, he
would be susceptible to Forrest's right hand. If Mosley instead moved
to the center, he would be in perfect position to receive the head
butt.</TE>
<TE>   Mosley also accused Forrest of excessive holding and throwing a
low blow that hit him on the spot where he has a scar from a hernia
operation.</TE>
<TE>   As expected, the Forrest camp laughed off the accusations. The
idea of a secret head-butting camp run by a trainer nobody would
identify and a sparring partner who wouldn't come forward drew
nothing but scorn from Forrest trainer Al Mitchell.</TE>
<TE>   'Who would teach that?" Mitchell said of the head-butt strategy.
"That's not [co-trainer] Ronnie Shields' style. That's not my style.
If you believe everything Mosley is saying, Vernon is going to bring
everything but a gun into the ring.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe because he lost so bad in the first fight, Shane is trying
to find something to sell tickets, to convince people it will be
close this time."</TE>
<TE>   Mosley claims Kushner received site-fee money belonging to Mosley,
but spent it instead on his other fighters.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a difference of opinion," Kushner said. "It's not
the first time the Mosleys [Shane and father/trainer Jack] and I have
had a difference of opinion on financial matters. The Mosleys and I
have always resolved these things amicably. It doesn't behoove either
of us to go to court. Whatever is due Shane, he will receive."</TE>
<TE>   As for DiBella, who formerly negotiated with Mosley as an HBO
executive, Mosley said, "He flip-flops so much, it's ridiculous.
After the fight, he'll probably flip-flop to be back on my team."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's rainstorm was gone in half an hour, leaving calm
weather in its wake. The storm within Mosley, however, is expected to
last until Saturday, if not longer.</TE>

<LD>The road, it turns out, was kind to the Galaxy as it began defense of
its U.S. Open Cup championship Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Very kind.</LD>
<LD>   The Galaxy went halfway across the country to beat the A-League's
Minnesota Thunder, 4-0, in a third-round game before 5,154 at the
National Sports Center in Blaine, Minn.</LD>
<TE>   It was the 10th time the Galaxy played on the road in its last 13
games.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy will remain on the road for the country's oldest soccer
tournament, playing the San Jose Earthquakes, who beat the Seattle
Sounders of the A-League, 4-3 in overtime, on Aug. 7 in a
quarterfinal match.</TE>
<TE>   Against the Thunder, midfielder Chris Albright scored two goals
and forward Carlos Ruiz and midfielder Alejandro Moreno each had a
goal and an assist. Goalkeeper Matt Reis, making his first start
since June 1, had six saves.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy's first score came in the 18th minute.</TE>
<TE>   With Ruiz approaching the goal on a one-on-one against goalkeeper
Jon Lowery, Ruiz suddenly passed left to an onrushing Moreno, who
scored.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz was named a starter for the MLS All-Star team that will face
the U.S. national team Aug. 3 in Washington, D.C.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Hit the Pros"</LD>
<LD>   Web site: www.foxsports.com/games</LD>
<TE>   Price: Free format; $9.95 monthly and $19.95 seasonal
subscriptions</TE>
<TE>   Most Internet sports games have a 1980s quality to them: dated
graphics, too simple, little connection to current athletes.</TE>
<TE>   "Hit the Pros," which was unveiled by FoxSports.com during the
All-Star game, is billed as a fast, challenging game with
PlayStation/Xbox quality.</TE>
<TE>   The concept allows players to choose selected hitters, among them
Sammy Sosa, Barry Bonds and Ichiro Suzuki, who face
computer-generated "pitchers" such as Randy Johnson and Pedro
Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   Using cameras and tracking software from games televised by Fox
and Fox Sports Net, actual pitches are simulated into the game and
inputted as quickly as 30 minutes after the completion of that day's
game.</TE>
<TE>   Hitting a Roger Clemens fastball is not easy, and the game's
makers, WildTangent and Adam Bain, FoxSports.com vice president of
production and development, have raised the difficulty quotient for
instances when players choose to attempt to hit a specialty pitch,
such as Mariano Rivera's cut fastball.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics are tied to the batter's performance, giving the game a
rotisserie element.</TE>
<TE>   Players select from 30 major league ballparks, weather conditions
and day or night game. Fox broadcasters Joe Buck, Tim McCarver, Thom
Brennaman and Steve Lyons "call" the action with Fox's baseball theme
music inserted. Additionally, hitters are equipped to pose when they
smash the pitches.</TE>

<LD>Double Cat, who has the pedigree to be a special filly, has won three
of four in a career that began more than a year ago. She'll try to
improve on that record when she breaks from the rail in today's
eighth at Belmont Park, a $50,000 allowance at one mile.</LD>
<LD>   A 4-year-old daughter of Storm Cat out of the stakes-winning mare
Hollywood Wildcat, Double Cat is owned and bred by Irving and
Marjorie Cowan, who also raced Hollywood Wildcat, and trained by Neil
Drysdale. Double Cat was beaten by Tamara Princess in her career
debut at Hollywood Park on July 11, 2001, but hasn't lost since.</LD>
<LD>   Today's race will be her first on dirt since her debut. Jerry
Bailey has the mount.</LD>
<TE>   Race of the day: Endless Summer, hampered by a slow start in his
U.S. debut for trainer Bobby Frankel, tries again in today's seventh,
a $51,000 allowance at 5 1/2 furlongs on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Trainer Steve Asmussen. He closed Lone Star Park's meet
with a flourish Sunday. He won seven of the day's 14 races to finish
with 95 victories, 12 more than Cole Norman. Asmussen is also the
country's leading trainer in terms of wins with 224 through Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: The field in today's 10th at Solano. The 13 original
entrants in the maiden race for Arabians are 0 for 96.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using It Was Meant To Be,
Shuffling Kid, Crooked Key, Classic Brief, Road To Justice and
Rainman's Request in the fifth, singling Stole My Heart in the sixth,
Endless Summer in the seventh and using T's Cafe, Conquistador Lad
and Runninwithscissors in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/162. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $13.60/$916.80. Total money bet: $1,050.</TE>

<HD>Van Boxmeer Joins Kings</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Successful coach and executive of minor league Ice
Dogs is hired as an assistant on Murray's staff.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings hired Long Beach Ice Dog Coach John Van Boxmeer as an
assistant coach, signing him to a multiyear deal Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Van Boxmeer, 50, has been with the Ice Dogs for seven seasons, as
vice president of hockey operations as well as coach.</LD>
<LD>   He replaces Dave Tippett, who was hired as coach of the Dallas
Stars.</LD>
<TE>   Van Boxmeer said that after he knew Tippett had the opportunity to
get a head-coaching job, he called King General Manager Dave Taylor
to let him know of his interest.</TE>
<TE>   Van Boxmeer is familiar to the Kings. He interviewed for the
team's head-coaching job after the 1998-99 season, when Andy Murray
was hired. The Ice Dogs have been a minor league affiliate of the
Kings in past seasons, making Van Boxmeer familiar with several of
the Kings' home-grown players.</TE>
<TE>   He also was considered for the Mighty Duck head-coaching vacancy
after the 1997-98 season.</TE>
<TE>   "I think his familiarity with our players and our organization is
very important and will make the transition much easier," Murray
said. "There was no question, he was a top candidate right away."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings' power play will be among Van Boxmeer's duties. The
Kings had the NHL's top power play last season at 20.7%</TE>
<TE>   "This is a team that has made great strides the last few years,"
Van Boxmeer said. "You want to go somewhere where it's a stable
organization that is going in a positive direction."</TE>
<TE>   Van Boxmeer had an 11-year career as a defenseman in the NHL with
the Montreal Canadiens, Colorado Rockies, Buffalo Sabres and Quebec
Nordiques that ended in 1984. He won the Stanley Cup with the
Canadiens in 1976. He had 84 goals and 358 points and was selected to
play in the 1982 All-Star game.</TE>
<TE>   He spent two seasons as an assistant coach for the Sabres from
1990-92. He had a 313-181-60 record as Ice Dog coach.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously he has credibility as a good player and as a successful
coach," Murray said. "He has a proven track record."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, unable to come to terms with free-agent right wing Tie
Domi last week, found some toughness by signing free-agent defenseman
Todd Reirden. Reirden, who is 6 feet 5, 225 pounds, had three goals
and 82 penalty minutes in 65 games with the Atlanta Thrashers last
season.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks also signed Jason Krog, a center who won the Hobey Baker
Award at New Hampshire in 1999. Krog's career has fizzled since, as
he played only 28 NHL games, all with the New York Islanders.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Have Cash in Reserve</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Free agent George didn't play big minutes,
but he gets a big raise with four-year, $20.9-million deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not only did the Lakers, in the end, pay Devean George as a starter,
they paid him more than three of their own.</LD>
<LD>   Angling to maintain the core elements of their three-time NBA
championship roster, the Lakers agreed to terms with George on a
free-agent contract worth $20.9 million over four years, the maximum
they could pay him over that term, his agent said Wednesday. George
can opt out after the third season.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers will announce the deal today, when George signs the
contract. He was expected to fly into Los Angeles on Wednesday night.</LD>
<TE>   On the day the NBA announced a lowering of its salary cap by more
than $2 million, the Laker payroll rose to about $60 million, about
$5 million more than last season, with at least two more
players--expected to be Brian Shaw and Slava Medvedenko--still to
sign. The club also could add a frontcourt player, preferably a
reserve center to spell Shaquille O'Neal, which would cost it at
least another $1 million, though that is not necessarily a priority.</TE>
<TE>   The critical part of the summer, however, ended almost as soon as
the signing period began.</TE>
<TE>   George, who has started two games in three years and averaged 7.1
points last season while earning $834,250, spent the past two weeks
visiting other teams. Apparently intrigued by George's athletic
ability and occasional dynamic play, several teams seemed eager to
pay at least what the Lakers did, causing Laker General Manager Mitch
Kupchak to improve on his earlier offers.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, George, whose salary next season will be $4.545 million
and increase by $454,500 in each of the following three seasons, will
earn more next season than small forward Rick Fox, point guard Derek
Fisher or power forward Samaki Walker, all likely starters.</TE>
<TE>   George, 24, did become a contributor last season. He set career
highs in nearly all statistical categories, and in parts of the
season played the fourth quarter ahead of Fox. He was a preferred
defensive matchup for Coach Phil Jackson against some of the larger,
athletic small forwards. Though he did not play particularly well in
the playoffs, when he said he believed his time with the Lakers was
"winding down," George had one last kick going into free agency,
scoring 11 points and taking six rebounds in 20 minutes in Game 4 of
the NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   George was not available for comment, according to his agent.</TE>
<TE>   "For Devean, his goal all along was to stay with the Lakers,"
George's agent, Mark Bartelstein, said. "It's where he wanted to be,
but we weren't sure if it would work out financially. He's very happy
it did."</TE>
<TE>   With the salary cap falling for the first time and many teams
already into the payroll tax, it would seem that George was wise to
move quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "Devean didn't want it hanging out there forever," Bartelstein
said. "We had a good idea what the market was for him. There was a
lot of interest and he had a lot of suitors. But if the Lakers could
get to that level, then I knew that was what he was going to want to
do."</TE>
<TE>   George probably passed on more playing time, and possibly a
starting job, in another city.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning a championship is a difficult thing," Bartelstein said.
"He's done it three times in a row. He feels like he's really grown
with the team. He feels like his role is going to continue to
flourish. ... He basically was really enjoying his life.</TE>
<TE>   "When it's all said and done, this is a 24-year-old guy who can be
a huge part of their future for a long, long time. You don't let a
guy like that get away. I think that's the conclusion they came to."</TE>
<TE>   Kupchak declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Though Shaquille O'Neal has not yet chosen a course of treatment,
the Lakers expect him to have minor surgery on his arthritic toe near
the end of summer and be ready to play by early in training camp....
The signing of George means it is very unlikely Mitch Richmond will
return.... The Lakers are well along in the Medvedenko negotiations,
and that contract should be announced any day. Shaw's deal should
move quickly as well.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There was one exceptional performance during the eight trials for the
$436,000 Ed Burke Memorial Futurity last Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Straw Flying Dash, a gelded son of Strawfly Special, won his heat
by 2 1/2 lengths while running the 350 yards in 17.38 seconds. It was
easily the fastest qualifying time and the best by a 2-year-old at
the distance at Los Alamitos.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Micah Leslie and Link Newcomb and trained by Dan
Francisco, Straw Flying Dash is now perfect in three starts. He will
be favored in the Burke, which will be run July 27.</LD>
<TE>   The rest of the qualifiers for the Grade I are: Special Queen SA,
Dashnlitia, Morning Snow, Deefirst, Suzy Cartel, A Royal Of Class,
Just Think, Red Lipstick and That Giver.</TE>
<TE>   Like Straw Flying Dash, Red Lipstick is undefeated. Owned by the
Vinewood Farms of George, Louis and Michael Lucas and trained by R.C.
Howell, Red Lipstick, a daughter of Corona Cartel, won by
three-quarters of a length Saturday night for her fourth victory. She
completed the 350 yards in 17.76 under jockey Steve Fuller.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Hempen Sun. 2. Pass The Bolgers. 3. Evolution One.
4. World Of Fun. 5. Bolt Ta Fame. 6. Go Meter Go. 7. Signed Corona.
8. KR Sir Lopesalot.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Straw Poll and Hempen Sun in the first, Synful Bounty
and Pass The Bolgers in the second, Evolution One and A Campus Chic
in the third and single World Of Fun in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Special Fly Bye had trouble in his latest and
could rebound in the seventh for trainer Donna McArthur..</TE>

<HD>Injuries End the Careers of Two UCLA Linemen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two offensive linemen who figured strongly in UCLA's plans have been
forced to retire because of injuries.</LD>
<LD>   John Ream, a third-year sophomore center from Las Vegas, and
Collin Barker, a redshirt freshman guard from Wortham, Texas, will
remain on scholarship but will not count against the limit of 85
scholarships for active players.</LD>
<LD>   Ream started against Washington State and played six games last
season. He was considered the top candidate to replace graduated
three-year starter Troy Danoff at center. Ream had problems with both
knees and his right foot and sat out spring practice because of
injuries.</LD>
<TE>   Barker has had ongoing problems with his left ankle and had
surgery during the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of the two players impacts depth on the line, which is
considered the Bruins' strength on offense.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Mociler, a reserve at guard and tackle last season, is
expected to move to center and compete against redshirt freshman Mike
McCloskey.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Henson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LeRoy Butler, a 12-year veteran with the Green Bay Packers, will
announce his retirement today, team spokesman Lee Remmel confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel first reported the news on its Web
site, saying Butler was retiring because his injured left shoulder
has failed to heal and he wouldn't be ready for the start of training
camp next week.</TE>
<TE>   Butler fell 15 games shy of tying Bart Starr's record of 196 games
played with the Packers. His 38 interceptions rank fourth in team
history.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Josh Evans, who last week won an appeal to have
his third substance-abuse suspension overturned, signed with the New
York Jets.</TE>
<TE>   Evans, a seven-year veteran, had 77 tackles and a career-high five
sacks for Tennessee last season after returning from a one-year
suspension.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Levon Kirkland, a two-time Pro Bowl selection who
helped Pittsburgh to the 1995 Super Bowl, has signed a one-year
contract with Philadelphia. Kirkland was released last week by
Seattle. Terms were not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Basketball</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit Pistons signed guard Chauncey Billups, a five-year
veteran, to a multiseason contract. Terms were not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Billups flourished last season as a starter with Minnesota. He
averaged 12.5 points and 5.5 assists.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas has agreed with restricted free-agent center Raef LaFrentz
on a seven-year contract worth about $60 million, the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram reported on its Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Former Utah Jazz center Olden Polynice, 37, was added by the
Toronto Raptors to their roster for the NBA summer league that begins
this week at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Free-agent point guard Jacque Vaughn signed with Orlando. He
averaged 6.6 points and 4.3 assists with Atlanta last season.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey increased ticket prices as much as 62.5% for some
seats. The old ticket prices ranged from $25 to $80. A ticket costing
$80 last season will cost $125 next season.</TE>
<TE>   Hockey</TE>
<TE>   As expected, Dave Lewis signed a two-year contract to replace
Scotty Bowman as coach of the Detroit Red Wings.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, 49, was a Red Wing assistant for 14 seasons and an NHL
player for 15.</TE>
<TE>   Bowman, the winningest coach in league history, retired June 13,
the night he won a record ninth Stanley Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Third-seeded Marcelo Rios, back after a three-month layoff because
of a knee injury, lost to Victor Hanescu, 6-0, 6-4, in the first
round of the Croatia Open at Umag.... Top-seeded Albert Costa
defeated qualifier Martin Verkerk, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, in the second round
of the Energis Open at Amersfoort, Netherlands.... Top-seeded Jiri
Novak defeated Ruben Ramirez Hidalgo, 3-6, 6-0, 6-2, in the first
round of the Mercedes Cup at Stuttgart, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Henry Liaw of Rowland Heights and Jay Choi of Cerritos advanced to
the second round of match play in the U.S. Amateur Public Links Golf
Championships with first-round victories at the Orchards Golf Club in
Washington, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Liaw, a senior at Los Altos High, defeated Russ Cunningham of
DeWitt, Mich., 4 and 2. Choi, a senior at Gahr High, beat John
Schones II of Tucson, 3 and 2.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Smith of Valencia, a senior at San Diego State, lost, 4
and 3, in his first-round match against Lee Williamson of
Crawfordsville, Ind. Stroke-play medalist and top-seeded Isaac
Jimison of Orangevale lost to Tele Wightman of Chicopee, Mass.</TE>

<HD>Baker Makes the Right Move for Giants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forced to choose between having closer Robb Nen face Albert Pujols or
Tino Martinez, San Francisco Giant Manager Dusty Baker chose
Martinez.</LD>
<LD>   Baker made the right choice.</LD>
<LD>   Nen got Martinez to ground into a game-ending double play with the
bases loaded, completing the Giants' 5-4 come-from-behind victory
over the St. Louis Cardinals on Wednesday night at St. Louis.</LD>
<TE>   "You're caught between a rock and a hard spot," Baker said. "You
don't really want to face Albert."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Kent tied the score with a home run in the eighth inning and
Benito Santiago connected for a go-ahead homer in the ninth, rallying
the Giants from a three-run deficit.</TE>
<TE>   In the ninth, Fernando Vina led off with a single. Placido Polanco
bunted but Kent dropped Nen's throw at first base. Nen got Jim
Edmonds to fly out to center but both runners advanced when center
fielder Tsuyoshi Shinjo threw to third.</TE>
<TE>   Baker elected to walk Pujols, who went three for four with a
two-run home run, to load the bases and have Nen face Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   "[Martinez] battles," said Nen, who earned his 25th save. "I tried
to keep the ball in. Tino's not the fastest runner. I just wanted to
keep the ball in on him and try to have him roll over on something.
It worked."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 12, Colorado 3--Curt Schilling became the first pitcher in
the majors to reach 16 victories, and Luis Gonzalez drove in five
runs at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling (16-3) gave up three runs and 10 hits in seven innings
to win his 10th in a row on the road. He struck out six and has 197
on the season, most in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling is 14-1 against National League teams this year, and has
won 10 in a row against National League West teams in two seasons. He
is 9-2 in 19 career starts against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 10, Florida 0--Greg Maddux pitched seven shutout innings
and Gary Sheffield had three hits for the Braves at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves won their second in a row after a three-game losing
streak, their first since mid-May. The Marlins have lost a
season-high seven in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Maddux (9-2), who hasn't lost in his last 15 starts, gave up six
singles and threw only 85 pitches, but was replaced by Kevin Gryboski
to start the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   New York 9, Montreal 6--Mo Vaughn had a run-scoring single, and
Edgardo Alfonzo hit a two-run double to spark a five-run eighth
inning at Montreal and give the Mets their fourth consecutive
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Vladimir Guerrero went four for five, homering in his first two
at-bats. He raised his home run total to 25 with his fifth multihomer
game this season.</TE>
<TE>   Vaughn hit his third consecutive single with one out in the eighth
against Scott Stewart (3-2) to put the Mets ahead, 5-4, and Alfonzo
followed with a two-run double. Roger Cedeno's sacrifice fly and Rey
Ordonez's run-scoring single made it 9-4.</TE>
<TE>   Expo Manager Frank Robinson was ejected for the second time this
season.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 6, Cincinnati 3--Pokey Reese drove in four runs with a
two-run homer and a single at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Reese put the Pirates ahead, 2-1, in the second inning with a
single that followed Kevin Young's leadoff single and Chad
Hermansen's double.</TE>
<TE>   His second homer this season came in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   With Jimmy Anderson (7-10) lasting seven innings for only the
second time in his last 11 starts, the Pirates improved to 6-1 since
the All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 4, Chicago 3--Pat Burrell went three for four with a
home run and helped Philadelphia score the winning run in the bottom
of the 10th inning with heads-up baserunning.</TE>
<TE>   The Phillies tied the score with two runs in the ninth inning
against Antonio Alfonseca.</TE>
<TE>   With runners on first and third and one out in the 10th, Burrell
was intentionally walked by Jeff Fassero (3-6). Travis Lee hit a
grounder to second baseman Mark Bellhorn. Burrell stopped and
Bellhorn chased him back toward first.</TE>
<TE>   While Bellhorn was chasing Burrell, Lee reached safely and Jason
Michaels scored the winning run.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 7, Milwaukee 3--Wade Miller gave up one hit in seven
innings at Milwaukee and he also ignited two rallies with leadoff
singles.</TE>
<TE>   Miller (6-3) improved to 9-1 with a 2.76 earned-run average in his
career against the Brewers and is 7-1 in 10 starts since returning
from the disabled list after sitting out because of a pinched nerve
in his neck.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Stairs hit a one-hop double to the wall in left-center in the
fifth inning for the only hit against Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Miller sparked the Astros' four-run third inning with a single,
the first hit against Glendon Rusch (5-9), and singled against Nelson
Figueroa in the seventh. He scored both times.</TE>

<HD>Cities Pursuing Olympics Need a Story to Tell</HD>
<DH>Analysis: With USOC having completed visits to each city,
will Sept. 11 give New York an edge over other U.S. finalists?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Along with plans for impressive sports facilities and the outline of
a sound financial package, recent history makes clear that what it
really takes to win the Olympic Games is elegantly simple: You need a
story. A truly compelling story.</LD>
<LD>   Beijing won the 2008 Games with this story: The Games have never
been held in China. China is home to 20% of the human race. It's
time.</LD>
<LD>   Athens won the 2004 Games like this: Greece is the birthplace of
the Olympic movement. Come home.</LD>
<TE>   Now the U.S. Olympic Committee must decide: New York, San
Francisco, Washington or Houston--which of these four has the best
story to tell in hopes of winning the 2012 Summer Games?</TE>
<TE>   Over the past few weekends, a USOC task force toured each of the
cities. Wrapping up the tour Monday in San Francisco, it saw
highways, byways, railways, ferries, stadiums, plans for stadiums.
All of which matters, according to Charles H. Moore, who heads the
task force.</TE>
<TE>   But what really matters is which city has a story to tell that
could reach voters in the European-dominated International Olympic
Committee. Moore said: "We really want the Olympic Games to come to
the United States in 2012--and if not then, in 2016. So we've got to
pick the bid that's going to be the right destination, the city that
has the right elements to attract the most IOC votes. It's that
simple."</TE>
<TE>   For proof, consider the 2008 election. An IOC task force had
ranked Beijing, Paris and Toronto equally capable of staging the
Games--in Olympic jargon, equal on "technical merit." Beijing, with
its attention-grabbing story, won in a rout.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, in the first act of the 2012 campaign, the USOC task
force eliminated Los Angeles and three other candidates. In
September, the task force will prune the four remaining cities to
two. In November, the USOC's 115-member board of directors will pick
one. In 2005, the IOC will choose the 2012 site.</TE>
<TE>   A number of cities worldwide have expressed interest in the 2012
Games. Among them: Paris, Rome, Madrid, Toronto, Rio de Janeiro,
Havana. Even Tel Aviv (where the slogan, unveiled earlier this month,
is, "Tel Aviv, you're allowed to dream").</TE>
<TE>   The 2012 situation is complicated by the contest for the 2010
Winter Games. Vancouver, Canada, and Salzburg, Austria, are
considered the leading candidates for 2010. The IOC will choose the
2010 site next July; most Olympic experts believe a Vancouver win
could dim U.S. chances in 2012.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington Post, citing an unnamed source, reported Wednesday
that Washington and San Francisco appear most likely to survive the
September cut. A "complete work of fiction and imagination," USOC
spokesman Mike Moran said in response.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco clearly holds international cachet. But it faces a
major hurdle: USOC uncertainty over a financial guarantee required of
all candidates. Such uncertainty played a role in the USOC decision
to eliminate Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The USOC demands a firm guarantee by state or local authorities in
case of unforeseen financial liabilities. In March, Gov. Gray Davis
signed a measure creating an Olympic-designated state trust fund; it
has no money in it and probably never will. That left the USOC with
more questions than answers; San Francisco now has only weeks to
generate a solution, if one can be found.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's bid centers on a renovated waterfront and a central
Olympic park in the area around RFK Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   That, though, was precisely Toronto's pitch for 2008--concentrated
venues along a renovated waterfront. Toronto was trounced.</TE>
<TE>   Washington also stands alone as the symbol of all that others
elsewhere love to resent about the U.S., particularly within the IOC,
which for years has sheltered strong anti-U.S. sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   In the midst of the Salt Lake corruption scandal, only one
nation's parliament summoned then-IOC President Juan Antonio
Samaranch for an explanation: The U.S. Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the Salt Lake Games proved successful. But some
influential IOC members are still smarting over slights that took
place during the Games--slights that would reflect only on
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   In opening the Salt Lake Games, for instance, President Bush
declared: "On behalf of a proud, determined and grateful nation, I
declare open the Games of Salt Lake City, celebrating the Winter
Olympic Games." He departed from the traditional Olympic declaration
by offering a patriotic preface and by delivering the one-sentence
address surrounded by the U.S. team.</TE>
<TE>   "Even Hitler didn't depart from protocol," one IOC member said
recently, a reference to the opening ceremony of the 1936 Summer
Games in Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   Houston has a much different image problem with which to contend.
Inevitably, it is compared in IOC circles--however unfairly--to
Atlanta, on the grounds that both are featureless, hot, muggy
Southern cities. Within the IOC, the Atlanta Olympics are typically
remembered for transport woes, technology problems and a murderous
bomb explosion.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the fourth-largest city in the country," Houston 2012 bid
President Susan Bandy said. "Comparatively speaking, we are so much
further along, however you look at it, than Atlanta ever will be."</TE>
<TE>   Virtually all the venues needed for an Olympics are already in
place in Houston, and the pitch there is for an indoor,
air-conditioned Games. "We love it when they underestimate us, and we
come through," Bandy said.</TE>
<TE>   No one ought to underestimate New York. The Games have never been
held in the nation's largest city. And is there a more compelling
story than the New York story, especially now?</TE>
<TE>   Bid leaders had sought before last Sept. 11 to portray New York as
the world's gathering place. "The city is an Olympic Village every
day," Dan Doctoroff, New York 2012's bid chief, has often said. Now
an element of any New York bid has to acknowledge the terror attacks,
and that the Games could help accelerate rebuilding in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   Just days after the World Trade Center towers fell, the mayor of
Rome suggested that all other potential 2012 candidates bow out in
favor of New York if it became the U.S. choice. IOC President Jacques
Rogge called the gesture premature. Now the USOC is set to trim the
field to two on or around Sept. 11 of this year; the timing strongly
suggests that New York will be kept in the mix.</TE>
<TE>   The New York bid committee plans to spend about $900 million on
Olympic facilities. In addition, the city, state and private
developers have plans to spend about $4.5 billion on projects that
would enhance an Olympic effort but are likely to be built in any
event.</TE>
<TE>   New York would need an Olympic stadium that would be built on the
west side of Manhattan and an Olympic Village to be built across
town, near U.N. headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   High construction costs alone, however, are not a bid-killer.
Chinese officials said before they won that they would spend $14
billion preparing for 2008; their estimate is up to $30 billion, and
the IOC is eagerly looking forward to the Beijing Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Already underway in Manhattan is a city- and state-backed
$50-million project to tackle the design, engineering and zoning
issues needed to bring the No. 7 subway to the far west side, where a
stadium would be built.</TE>
<TE>   The plan is to have construction begin by early 2005--just before
the IOC vote.</TE>
<TE>   And who was recently announced as chairman of the New York 2012
management committee? Harvey Schiller, a former USOC executive
director and 1994 recipient of the Olympic Order, the IOC's highest
honor.</TE>
<TE>   Now that is how the IOC game is played.</TE>
<TE>   In Olympic politicking, New York bid leader Doctoroff said, "The
United States has to overcome an inherent deficit." But in New York,
he said, "We have a fabulous story."</TE>

<LD>Today is the two-year anniversary of the first appearance of this
Page Two column. Auditors are still adding up the number of canceled
subscriptions.</LD>
<LD>   For those betting the over and under that it wouldn't last two
days--you lose. By the way that's not the first wager Sports Editor
Bill Dwyre has lost, and I'm hoping it's not his last. "I'm betting
there won't be a third anniversary," Dwyre said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   It's with that kind of inspiration I begin a third year--still
waiting for USC President Steven Sample to return a call, but
thrilled to learn former Dodger F.P. Santangelo has lifted his
batting average to .157 for the Sacramento River Cats.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'M SURE it's only a coincidence, but today is also the two-year
anniversary of Kevin Brown standing on a table in the middle of the
Dodger clubhouse throwing a tantrum, tossing a metal container of
sanitary socks against the wall and then demanding officials revoke
the Page Two columnist's media credentials and post pictures of all
Times' sportswriters so security could refuse them admittance.</TE>
<TE>   I believe it's also the last time Kevin Brown was healthy enough
to pitch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ON MONDAY I requested through Dodgers' public relations an
interview with Brown. On Tuesday morning a spokesman said they had
not talked to Brown yet because they hadn't found just the right time
to do it.</TE>
<TE>   I got to thinking, what would be the right time to approach Brown?
After being sedated with a dart shot from long range? By radio after
he has lifted off in a spacecraft for the moon? Frozen and hanging
upside down alongside Ted Williams?</TE>
<TE>   Before Tuesday night's game, a Dodger spokesman informed me Brown
had elected not to speak. You can imagine my surprise.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I COULDN'T be sure, though, the message had been delivered to him
correctly. What if the PR guy had said, "Do you want to talk to a
Times columnist?"</TE>
<TE>   Would you want to talk with Pucin or Plaschke? I wanted him to
know I was the one willing to chat, and went to him myself. I thought
about asking to borrow Chad Kreuter's mask, chest protector and shin
guards because he doesn't use them much, but instead made plans to
duck if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you want to talk about?" Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   I told him this was his chance to wish me a heartfelt "happy
anniversary," saving him the trouble of buying and then sending a
card.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen a retraction from something you made up, so I'm
not interested in talking," he said, and then he was gone to leave me
wondering what I was supposed to retract.</TE>
<TE>   I looked back through some of the 450 columns I've written the
past two years, many that included Mr. Grumpy's name, and in every
one of them he came off like a jerk, so it's not like I was making up
anything. I dug deeper.</TE>
<TE>   I found the column I wrote about the kissing lesbians in Dodger
Stadium in which I discovered one of them was porn star Nico
Treasures, and even went back to her Web site Wednesday to see if
there was any improper mention of Mr. Grumpy. But there were only
pictures--just the same, I checked every one of them closely, but
never noticed Mr. Grumpy.</TE>
<TE>   I looked at the Cade McNown column about him stealing one of Hef's
roommates, resulting in his banishment from the Playboy Mansion and
there was some mention of Dumbo in there, but I think I was talking
about McNown's ears and not Brown. I could see, though, where that
might have hit a little close to home with Brown.</TE>
<TE>   I know I wrote about him dropping his pants, bending over and
slapping his bare behind on more than one occasion after a female
reporter had walked by, but he couldn't be upset about that because
he has admitted to team officials as much.</TE>
<TE>   I'd hope by the time we get together again for anniversary No. 3,
Mr. Grumpy would be more specific about what he wants.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CHOKING DOGS' update: When we last left the guys Tuesday, they
were falling apart. Before Wednesday's game, Paul Lo Duca chose to
disagree with this assessment, and did so in a calm and professional
manner before going out and getting three hits.</TE>
<TE>   In the middle of this discussion, however, Brian Jordan busted in
and did his Gary Sheffield imitation. "Just don't talk to me," Jordan
shouted, and I told him I really couldn't do that anyway, because
when the going gets tough he likes to go out the back door and avoid
the media.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what?" he said. "You write negative."</TE>
<TE>   On a positive note, Jordan only struck out two of the three times
he came to the plate in the Dodgers' 7-0 defeat, and misplayed only
one ball hit to him in the outfield.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, I would think a very good game for Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'LL TELL you how tight the Dodgers are these days: I even got the
cold shoulder from pint-sized "Dawson's Creek" actor James Van Der
Beek, who has been running around in a Dodger uniform the past few
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "You got him in trouble," Eric Karros said. "No one knew he was
here until you wrote about it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE DODGERS are 5-11 since Manager Jim Tracy delivered his "I told
you so" speech in Anaheim, declaring the organization great and
everyone else dumb for doubting the team's chances for success.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ALONG WITH the Page Two anniversary, today is also the birthday of
the wife, and while it has been a wonderful life, what if she hadn't
been born some 50 or 60 years ago? I wouldn't have two daughters,
there wouldn't be a grocery store bagger, and I wouldn't have
anything to write about. Thus, no column.</TE>
<TE>   If you want to blame anyone for the past two years, blame the wife
for being born.</TE>

<LD>Defying the wishes of FIFA, which wants to see the number of games
reduced, South America will continue to organize its World Cup
qualifying tournament as a single, 10-nation group.</LD>
<LD>   That was the unanimous decision reached in Buenos Aires at a
meeting of the leaders of CONMEBOL, the continent's soccer
confederation.</LD>
<LD>   "There is unanimity to play the qualifiers in a round-robin
format," said Eugenio Figuerdo, president of Uruguay's soccer
federation, "and to make this possible they must be held from 2003 to
2005."</LD>
<TE>   The decision means South American countries will continue to play
18 qualifying matches apiece, and CONMEBOL will ask FIFA to set aside
five playing dates in August 2003, seven in February 2004 and the
remaining six 2005.</TE>
<TE>   European clubs that have to release their South American players
for each of those 18 games are sure to fight the CONMEBOL proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the organization also decided to stage the next Copa
America, the continental championship, in Peru in 2004 and to switch
from holding the event every two years to every four years.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz an MLS All-Star</TE>
<TE>   Galaxy striker Carlos Ruiz Wednesday was named one of 11 starters
on the Major League Soccer team that will play the United States
national team in the seventh MLS All-Star game Aug. 3 at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The Guatemalan forward, in his debut season in MLS, has scored 13
goals and is tied for the league scoring lead with another all-star
selection, striker Taylor Twellman of the New England Revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Three other players also will make their all-star debut. They are
former UCLA defender Carlos Bocanegra of the Chicago Fire, defender
Ryan Suarez of the Dallas Burn and midfielder Richard Mulrooney of
the San Jose Earthquakes.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the MLS starters are goalkeeper Tim Howard (New
York/New Jersey MetroStars); defender Mike Petke (MetroStars), and
midfielders Carlos Valderrama (Colorado Rapids), Mark Chung (Rapids),
Steve Ralston (Revolution) and Dema Kovalenko (Fire).</TE>
<TE>   Arena Likely to Stay</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Arena, the coach who led the U.S. to its best World Cup
performance in more than seven decades, is likely to remain in charge
of the team, if a satisfactory contract can be agreed upon.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Robert S. Contiguglia, the president of U.S. Soccer, had
said it was up to Arena to decide what he wants.</TE>
<TE>   Said Contiguglia: "Bruce has to decompress and decide what he
wants to do with his life."</TE>

<HD>The Stars Come Out for This Preview</HD>
<DH>Swimming: The Janet Evans Invitational begins today at USC,
giving top athletes a perfect tuneup for next month's summer
nationals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's called the Janet Evans Invitational, but the four-day swim meet
that begins today at USC is actually a dress rehearsal for the
national championships in Florida next month.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the top swimmers in the nation are scheduled to compete,
including Olympic medalists Erik Vendt, Lenny Krayzelburg, Aaron
Peirsol and teenage phenom Michael Phelps, the world-record holder in
the butterfly.</LD>
<LD>   The finals begin at 5 p.m. each day through Sunday. The men's and
women's 800-meter freestyles are the only finals on today's schedule.</LD>
<TE>   The gap between the Evans meet and the Phillips 66 Summer
Nationals is 3 1/2 weeks, making this competition an ideal tune-up.
There's enough time to rest and the conditions--both meets are
outdoors--will be similar.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a really fast meet," said Vendt, an Olympic
silver medalist and the NCAA swimmer of the year last spring for USC.
"I was looking at the competition and it's pretty amazing."</TE>
<TE>   Vendt, 21, is hoping to win national titles in the 400 individual
medley and 1,500 freestyle, events he won at the NCAA championships
last spring. His main competition will come from Phelps in the medley
and Chris Thompson in the freestyle and he'll likely race against
both swimmers this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "When I'm in the blocks this weekend, it will be really easy to
picture myself at the national championships," said Vendt, who won
his Olympic silver medal in the 400 individual medley. "Especially
with guys like [Phelps and Thompson] next to me."</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Mark Schubert said Phelps is on the verge of becoming
"all everything" in men's swimming. Phelps, who lives in Baltimore,
was only 15 when he competed at the 2000 Olympics, the youngest men's
team member since 1932. He was USA Swimming men's swimmer of the year
in 2001, setting a world record in the 200 butterfly at the spring
nationals, then lowering it at the world championships last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Phelps hasn't raced in Southern California since he was a child.
Before arriving Monday, he spent three weeks conditioning at the
Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs. Phelps, who turned 17 on
June 30, has never raced after dropping down from altitude, a common
tactic used by elite runners preparing for a big race.</TE>
<TE>   "They say you get faster," Phelps said. "It will be interesting to
see what happens."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, 23, a Roseburg, Ore. native who graduated from Michigan
in 2001, won bronze in the 1,500 freestyle at the 2000 Olympics,
joining Vendt as the only American to break 15 minutes in the event.
More recently, he won silver in the 1,500 at the Short Course World
Championships in April, shortly after winning the event at the spring
nationals for his sixth national title.</TE>
<TE>   The 400 individual medley is scheduled for Saturday and the 1,500
freestyle will be on Sunday. "It will give me a good chance to race
them and see where I'm at before nationals," said Vendt, who would
have been the top-seeded swimmer in today's 800 freestyle but won't
participate because of a conflict with a summer class.</TE>
<TE>   Another featured match-up will be in the men's 200 backstroke on
Friday. Krayzelburg and Peirsol will likely race for the first time
since Krayzelburg edged Peirsol to win the gold medal at the 2000
Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Krayzelburg, a USC graduate, has since been slowed by shoulder
injuries, andPeirsol has emerged as the premier backstroker in the
world. Peirsol, who graduated from Newport Harbor High last month,
broke Krayzelburg's long-course world record in the 200 backstroke in
March.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty excited for the race," Krayzelburg said. "It's about
time for me to get back into racing."</TE>
<TE>   Other notable athletes scheduled to compete include national team
members Amanda Beard, Lindsay Benko, Adrienne Binder, Maggie Bowen,
Greg Busse, Chad Carvin, Natalie Coughlin, Haley Cope, Klete Keller,
Tara Kirk, Diana MacManus, Gabrielle Rose, Staciana Stitts, Scott
Tucker and Tom Wilkens.</TE>

<HD>USTA Program Coming to Carson</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Association and AEG to announce plans for national
training center where young players can be molded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a board meeting at Indian Wells more than a year ago when the
USTA fielded criticism about its player development program. Eliot
Teltscher, among others, later characterized the situation as
"treading water."</LD>
<LD>   The path to a possible solution was cleared, coincidentally, with
the construction by the Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) of a major
facility in Southern California, the $130-million sports complex in
Carson, which includes a 13,000-seat tennis stadium and 36 new or
renovated courts.</LD>
<LD>   AEG and the USTA will announce today that the USTA will launch its
USA Tennis High Performance national training center in Carson, a
program designed to mold future champions in a competitive
environment. The headquarters for the program remain in Key Biscayne,
Fla., giving the USTA a presence in two hotbeds.</LD>
<TE>   Months ago, AEG announced the Carson facility will house the Pete
Sampras Tennis Academy. That academy is not affiliated with the
USTA's developmental plans. The Home Depot National Training Center
is scheduled to be completed in June 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Said Paul Annacone, the managing director of USA High Performance:
"One of the things we're trying to do is give the players in the
hotbeds of America a facility to help chase their dreams.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a great breeding ground for champions. They [the
Southern California Tennis Assn.] have done a great job in the past,
and we look forward to trying to have some good integration with
those folks."</TE>
<TE>   It has been difficult to put the top players in consistent,
competitive situations against one another because of simple
geography.</TE>
<TE>   "With all of our great resources, one of the biggest liabilities
we have is actually the size of our country," Annacone said. "Some of
the smaller countries have done so well because they have centralized
their training for their best players. We have a great challenge to
figure out the best way to set up a situation that would mirror that
even though the country is so large."</TE>
<TE>   Arlen Kantarian, the USTA's chief executive of professional
tennis, said the AEG deal is a first step in a series of upcoming
moves.</TE>
<TE>   "It is certainly part of a much larger deal, and a larger concept
moving forward," he said. "This training center is the first tangible
development in continuing to build more tennis programming in L.A.,
continuing with their facility expertise, to the possibility of
building new state-of-the-art complexes or training centers in other
key cities."</TE>

<HD>Tragedy at Tour: Vehicle Strikes, Kills 7-Year-Old</HD>
<DH>Cycling: Boy was crossing stage route when hit. Frenchman
Halgand wins stage, and Armstrong remains in second.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PAU, France</DL>
<LD>A child's death overshadowed Lance Armstrong's ride to the foot of
the Pyrenees, where he is expected to make his first serious assault
on this year's Tour de France.</LD>
<LD>   Before riders started Wednesday's 10th leg from Bazas to Pau, a
car from the Tour convoy struck and killed a 7-year-old boy who was
crossing the stage route.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a tragedy," deputy Tour director Daniel Baal said. "A
child's death puts everything else into perspective."</LD>
<TE>   The boy, Melvin Pompele, was one of thousands of fans who line the
Tour route every day to cheer riders and receive small gifts from
race sponsors. Only short stretches of the route have safety
barriers.</TE>
<TE>   Pompele was hit by a car belonging to candy maker Haribo, but Tour
director Jean-Marie Leblanc said there was no evidence the boy was
reaching for candy thrown from the vehicle when he was hit.</TE>
<TE>   Leblanc added that a moment of silence would be held today.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers beefed up road safety after a Tour car hit and killed a
12-year-old fan during the race two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's racing was uneventful, over a flat 91.14-mile course
through southwest France.</TE>
<TE>   Frenchman Patrice Halgand took the leg, in the third fastest time
for a flat stage in Tour history--3 hours, 15 seconds, with an
average speed of 30.337 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Spain's Igor Gonzalez de Galdeano retained the yellow jersey worn
by the race leader for a seventh consecutive day. Armstrong, the
three-time defending champion, finished with the main pack 3:47
behind Halgand, and continued to trail Gonzalez de Galdeano by 26
seconds in the overall standings.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez de Galdeano tested positive for the restricted substance
salbutamol but was not punished. Organizers and world cycling's
governing body, the UCI, said he was authorized to use the product,
which is taken to treat asthma.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Armstrong has waited until the first mountain stage
to take control of the Tour. Huge chunks of time can be won or lost
in the mountains, where the Tour title usually is decided.</TE>
<TE>   Today's leg, which takes riders on a tough 97.96-mile stretch
through the Pyrenees, should show whether Armstrong is strong enough
to win a fourth consecutive title.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong said that one of his main rivals in the mountains will
be Spaniard Joseba Beloki, who has finished third in the Tour the
last two years.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a great climber," Armstrong said. "He has good experience
here, he has a strong team. I think he's a bigger threat than
Galdeano."</TE>
<TE>   Another possible challenger is Colombia's Santiago Botero. The
Kelme rider upset Armstrong to win Monday's time trial but is
notoriously inconsistent.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple of years ago, he was more of a climber," Armstrong said.
"Now he's more of a time-trialist."</TE>
<TE>   At the Dauphine Libere race last June, Botero "was very
inconsistent. He won the time trial, and the next day he lost 15
minutes. It was amazing. But if he puts it all together, he's very
strong."</TE>
<TE>   Other challengers include Oscar Sevilla of Spain, Kazakhstan's
Andrei Kivilev and Lithuania's Raimondas Rumsas.</TE>
<TE>   "Rumsas is the biggest outside threat," Armstrong said. "He's
definitely a rider with a lot of potential, probably a guy who wants
to prove something.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very quiet. Nobody really knows him. But he's a strong guy,
and one that we have to watch."</TE>
<TE>   Today's stage starts in Pau and ends in the ski station of La
Mongie.</TE>

<HD>Sparks' Run Breaks Fever</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Sparks trailed by six points, Lisa Leslie had five fouls and the
Indiana Fever seemed poised to make a run at a surprise victory.</LD>
<LD>   Then the Sparks showed why they are the defending WNBA champions,
using a 20-4 run midway through the second half to put the game away.</LD>
<LD>   Mwadi Mabika had 27 points and 10 rebounds, and Leslie, playing
through foul trouble, added 14 points and 14 rebounds to lead the
Sparks to a 73-58 victory over the Fever Wednesday night at
Indianapolis in front of 7,029.</LD>
<TE>   Leslie, coming off her All-Star game most-valuable-player
performance, was called for three fouls in the first two minutes of
the second half, giving her five and sending her to the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of weird because I actually got three offensive fouls,"
Leslie said. "I just had to make the adjustment to not play defense.
That's not something I'm used to doing."</TE>
<TE>   She left with the score tied, 36-36, but consecutive three-point
baskets by Rita Williams and Tamika Catchings gave the Fever a 46-40
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Catchings, who led the East in scoring in the All-Star game, led
the Fever with 15 points but was only five for 16 from the field.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks (16-3) scored six consecutive points and eventually
took the lead for good at 50-48 on a basket by DeLisha Milton, then
pushed the lead to 60-50, capping the run.</TE>
<TE>   Nikki McCray, who added 11 points, made a three-point basket with
4:30 remaining as the Fever (8-12) pulled to within 60-53. It was as
close as it would get.</TE>
<TE>   Spark Coach Michael Cooper said switching at halftime from a
man-to-man defense to a 2-3 zone was the difference.</TE>
<TE>   "That kind of held them down a little bit as far as taking shots
over the top," he said. "I believe man-to-man is the way to go, but
it is a good part of our defense we can use."</TE>
<TE>   Indiana Coach Nell Fortner said her team couldn't make the
necessary adjustments.</TE>
<TE>   "We lost our legs against the zone," Fortner said.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 75, Houston 67--Margo Dydek overcame a first-half knee injury
to score 17 points and grab 14 rebounds for the Starzz (14-6) at Salt
Lake City in front of 7,382.</TE>
<TE>   Janeth Arcain had 17 for Houston (16-5).</TE>
<TE>   Portland 73, Phoenix 61--DeMya Walker scored 17 points to help the
Fire (12-9) win at Portland in front of 7,291. It was the Mercury's
16th consecutive road loss, which tied a WNBA record. Gordana Grubin
led Phoenix (8-12) with 21 points.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 89, Orlando 62--Tammy Sutton-Brown scored a career-high
22 points for the Sting (12-8) at Charlotte, N.C., in front of 7,623.
The second half was marred by a fight between Charlotte's Summer Erb
and Orlando's Jessie Hicks. Hicks was ejected after she threw a
punch. Orlando fell to 9-10.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 78, Miami 62--Tangela Smith led four Monarchs in double
figures, scoring 18 points in a victory at Miami. It was the
Monarchs' first win in 11 road games. The announced attendance was
15,519. Sacramento moved to 4-15 and Miami fell to 9-11.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 58, Minnesota 48--Ann Wauters scored 14 points and the
Rockers (8-12) used a 10-0 run in each half to win at Minneapolis
before 5,087. It was the sixth consecutive loss for the Lynx (6-14).</TE>
