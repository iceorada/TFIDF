<HD>Fingerprints open door to theft protection</HD>

<LD>In the future, even a thief with the keys might not get far in a
stolen car.</LD>
<LD>   A fingerprint sensor developed by Siemens Biometrics that adjusts
comfort and convenience features to suit different drivers also can
electronically immobilize the engine if the person behind the wheel
isn't an authorized user.</LD>
<LD>   The sensor, which is about the size of a postage stamp and mounts
on the center console, will debut next year on European versions of
the Audi A8, said Michael Weber, North American sales director for
Siemens Biometrics, a division of German electronics giant Siemens.</LD>
<TE>   Initially, the fingerprint sensor will not be able to immobilize
the engine, Weber said. Instead, it will set electronic features to
preferences such as seat, mirror and steering-column positions, radio
stations and climate control, selected by as many as four drivers and
stored in memory.</TE>
<TE>   Weber envisions future applications, though, as an anti-theft
device in which the engine shuts down, the doors lock and
satellite-based equipment summons police.</TE>
<TE>   "The auto industry hasn't accepted this yet, but we could do it,"
Weber said.</TE>
<TE>   Audi of America has not decided whether the sensor will be on U.S.
versions of the next-generation A8, scheduled to arrive next summer,
spokeswoman Jennifer Cortez said.</TE>
<TE>   Audi has exclusive use of Siemens' fingerprint sensor for two
years, but Weber expects other automakers to embrace the technology
and use the security capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers would have to "enroll their finger" through a dealer to
use the car. If they forget to identify themselves by placing a
finger on the sensor, an interior warning would prompt them.</TE>

<HD>Things we do to our cars</HD>
<DH>The annual SEMA show displays parts and equipment to
customize appearance, performance</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It began life as the Speed Equipment show in 1967, and in the years
since has grown to become a gargantuan annual display of what the
automotive aftermarket is up to. That market, which specializes in
things we get for and do to our cars and trucks after we buy them, is
loosely divided into appearance -- or look-good -- and performance --
or go-fast -- parts and equipment.</LD>
<LD>   The trade group that puts it together is SEMA, the Specialty
Equipment Market Assn., and this year its show, open to the trade
only, drew more than 85,000 auto industry people. They ranged from
big-name auto executives such as Chrysler Group's Dieter Zetsche and
car designers such as Ford Motor Co.'s J Mays to guys such as Billy
Andrews, sales manager for Bazo Wheels, a City of Industry company
that makes those outrageously huge custom wheels your favorite NBA
player probably has installed on his shiny Cadillac Escalade or Ford
Excursion.</LD>
<LD>   Andrews, like many at this year's show, described it in just a few
words: "unbelievable, and big, really big."</LD>
<TE>   The first adjective was in reference to the huge assortment of
goodies that could be found, the second and third to the size of the
show, which occupied 2 million square feet of the newly enlarged Las
Vegas Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   Even when it was a little thing held in L.A., the Speed ... er,
the SEMA show was the place to spot automotive trends.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the only people who get to spot them are the
manufacturers, buyers and retailers who attend in hopes of making
deals for what will be the hottest sellers in next year's market.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, that is.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer John O'Dell prowled the show for several days
last week, feet aching and camera clicking, to see what he could see
-- and to bring back for Highway 1 and its readers a glimpse of
what's going to be hot for 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Take a look ...</TE>

<HD>Broader choice in satellite radio</HD>
<DH>Ford will put Sirius receivers in many models in 2003,
raising the stakes against XM.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fans of satellite radio, limited to a single provider for the first
half of the year, finally have a serious second contender to
consider. Satellite broadcaster Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. has
signed a deal for Ford Motor Co. -- an investor in the firm -- to
begin offering Sirius-receiving radios in many of its cars in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   That's good news for those who think competition is a good thing,
as New York-based Sirius has been losing money and didn't launch its
nationwide service until July, almost seven months after competitor
XM Satellite Radio went on the air.</LD>
<LD>   But with the announcement that certain models of Ford and the
automaker's Lincoln, Mercury, Aston Martin, Jaguar, Volvo and Land
Rover brands will offer Sirius radios exclusively beginning in
January, the broadcaster's future seems more settled.</LD>
<TE>   Sirius also has exclusive agreements with BMW, DaimlerChrysler and
Mazda and non- exclusive pacts with Nissan, Porsche and Volkswagen in
which the automakers let consumers decide which satellite-ready radio
they want.</TE>
<TE>   XM and Sirius broadcast on different frequencies with different
signal encryption, making it difficult and expensive to design a
radio to receive both. XM, backed by General Motors Corp. and Honda
Motor Co., has its own deals.</TE>
<TE>   We've reviewed satellite radio -- XM was the only provider at the
time (Highway 1, April 3) -- and generally liked it.</TE>
<TE>   But there were drawbacks. Some XM stations share programming, so
it's possible to hear the same music selections, or the same comedy
routines, on different stations at different times of the day if you
are channel surfing. And XM sells advertising on many of its music
channels.</TE>
<TE>   Sirius shares all of the good things about satellite radio and
says it provides better reception and higher-quality broadcast sound
than its competitor (a lot of that, or course, is in the ear -- and
audio equipment -- of the listener). Sirius also boasts that its 60
music channels are commercial free (each company offers 100 channels,
60 with music and 40 with talk, news and entertainment programming).</TE>
<TE>   The improved sound comes from a system that reallocates bandwidth
among channels as content demands -- for example, sending more signal
to channels playing music while taking signal away from channels
playing talk. Sirius says the difference in sound from the greater
bandwidth is akin to the difference between music on cassette tape
and CDs.</TE>
<TE>   The improved signal strength comes from the special positioning of
Sirius' three broadcast satellites, which beam their signals from
directly overhead in most of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   XM's satellites sit lower on the horizon and can sometimes be
blocked by tall structures, mountain peaks and even tall trees. Of
course, tunnels and overpasses can block any satellite signal.</TE>
<TE>   But a subscription to Sirius costs more, $12.95 a month versus
$9.99 for XM. The company insists that its sound, reception and
commercial-free music channels are worth the $2.96 monthly
difference.</TE>
<TE>   (Satellite-ready radios and installation cost about the same for
either system, and if added to a car rather than purchased as an
installed option in a new vehicle can range from $200 to more than
$800.)</TE>
<TE>   The big benefits of satellite, other than the ability to listen to
the same programming all across the country, are variety and freedom
from the annoying chatter that accompanies most commercial radio
programming.</TE>
<TE>   Original programming from Sirius and XM follows the same paths,
with something for just about every imaginable taste in music, talk,
variety and sports. Still, it's nice that we can choose. Now, if only
someone would figure out how to build an affordable car stereo that
would receive either, instead of one or the other.</TE>

<HD>Jacked-up vehicles raise safety, enforcement questions</HD>
<DH>Targeting potentially unsafe monster trucks illegally
driven on city streets doesn't appear to be a priority for police.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeanne Wright</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baffled by the number of giant, jacked-up pickups and sport utility
vehicles he sees traveling on public roads, a Laguna Beach reader
asks why police aren't cracking down.</LD>
<LD>   "My family is at risk when I am following one of these vehicles,"
Robert Minck said.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, if the bumpers have been removed and the height of the
truck has been raised above legal standards, a collision could prove
deadly.</LD>
<TE>   "The first contact of my car with their vehicle would be either at
windshield level or when my bumper hits their rear axle," Minck said.</TE>
<TE>   He's right.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these tall trucks could steamroll over most passenger
vehicles -- and they have, said Clarence Ditlow, director of the
Center for Auto Safety in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Police should approach the problem of on-street use of too-tall
vehicles as "seriously as they take red-light running and drunk
driving," he said.</TE>
<TE>   California limits the height of a modified vehicle by measuring
from the ground to the lowest point of the frame.</TE>
<TE>   For example, when a Ford Excursion comes off the assembly line and
is sold, the distance between the ground and the frame is about 14
1/2 inches. But the law allows big vehicles such as the Excursion and
the Chevy Suburban -- which can weigh up to 10,000 pounds -- to be
lifted so there is as much as 31 inches between the ground and the
frame.</TE>
<TE>   The ground-to-frame limit for most passenger cars is 23 inches.
Small trucks, including minivans, have a limit of 27 inches. For
larger trucks of as much as 7,500 pounds gross weight -- a Ford F150
or a Chevy Silverado -- the limit is 30 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Vehicles that exceed those limits cannot legally be driven on
public roads. If an owner intends to go off-roading in the desert
with a vehicle jacked up to exceed the limits, it is supposed to be
towed to the off-road destination.</TE>
<TE>   Serious off-road enthusiasts buy lift kits and giant tires to
equip their vehicles for their outdoor adventures.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that some vehicles modified to look like
off-roaders never venture from city streets.</TE>
<TE>   For their owners, the extra height is an automotive style
statement. The message, apparently, is that the bigger my truck, the
tougher I am.</TE>
<TE>   But whether drivers are using lift kits to raise vehicles several
feet above stock height or adding greatly oversized tires to gain
additional lift, the modification can pose serious safety risks, said
David Champion, director of automotive testing for Consumer Reports
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Big trucks and SUVs already are susceptible to rollovers because
of their high centers of gravity. Raising the vehicle even higher
further compromises its handling, Champion said.</TE>
<TE>   National Highway Traffic Safety Administration tests have shown
that just adding passengers and cargo to a SUV riding at stock height
can double the rollover risk.</TE>
<TE>   And adding oversized tires that have more grip than stock tires
doesn't help, he said. The increased grip and extra height increase
the risk of rollover, he said. Bigger tires are heavier, too, and
that adds to a vehicle's emergency stopping distance.</TE>
<TE>   But targeting potentially unsafe monster trucks driven illegally
on city streets and highways doesn't appear to be high on the list of
police priorities.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't get involved much with that.... Our job is to catch
criminals," said Jason Lee, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police
Department. Using a modified vehicle that is not street legal for
city driving is a minimal offense compared with driving under the
influence of alcohol or drugs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The California Highway Patrol insists that its officers work hard
to enforce the laws regarding vehicle height because it is a safety
issue.</TE>
<TE>   Yet neither the CHP nor NHTSA keep numbers on how many modified
vehicles are cited or are involved in accidents.</TE>
<TE>   All new vehicles produced and sold in the United States must
comply with federal safety standards promulgated by NHTSA. But once a
vehicle is purchased, it falls under state and local jurisdiction, so
each state can have its own regulations regarding modification of
trucks and autos.</TE>
<TE>   In California, violators of height limits can be cited for using
unsafe equipment. But auto safety advocates believe a "fix-it" ticket
isn't tough enough to stop drivers from flouting the law.</TE>
<TE>   California's height limits allow owners to change tire size or
modify the vehicle "within reason," said Steve Mazor, an automotive
expert with the Automobile Club of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that "a lot of the vehicles we see are raised quite
a bit higher than the limit and are illegally being driven on public
roads," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The growing popularity of these extreme vehicles has resulted in
an increasing number of complaints from drivers who say they fear for
their safety if they get into an accident with these oversized
pickups and SUVs, Mazor said.</TE>
<TE>   The Auto Club also hears concerns about dangerous headlight glare
from jacked-up trucks.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes sense to step up enforcement," Mazor said.</TE>
<TE>   Candysse Miller, director of the Insurance Information Network in
Los Angeles, agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "It's scary. One of these large, lifted pickup trucks pulled up
next to my car recently. Its massive tires were at eye level when I
looked out my window. I felt like I was next to a jetliner."</TE>

<HD>Dazzling and so much more</HD>
<DH>At lively Ngoc Suong, the seafood lives up to the
spectacular presentation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Linda Burum</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Somewhere between the funkiness of a Vietnamese noodle shop and the
polish of an Aubergine or Pinot Provence lies Ngoc Suong. A
Euro-Vietnamese menu and theatrical presentations have made this
noisy, lively dining room one of the coolest places to eat in Orange
County.</LD>
<LD>   The lure is Ngoc Suong's long list of Vietnamese-style fish and
seafood dishes -- a relatively new phenomenon in Little Saigon, since
Chinese restaurants have long monopolized seafood dining in the
neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   Ngoc Suong's building looks as if it may have done time as a
coffee shop or fast-food depot. But someone has transformed the room
into a dreamy Somerset Maugham-type setting with greenery, heavy
white plantation shutters and classical Vietnamese musical
instruments hung on the walls.</LD>
<TE>   The tropical reverie is interrupted somewhat by the yummy-looking
European desserts in a glass case near the door and the Britney
Spears sound-alike warbling in Vietnamese over the sound system (no
doubt a product of Little Saigon's budding recording industry).</TE>
<TE>   You won't have to guess what the house specialty is. Ca dut lo
Ngoc Suong (whole broiled catfish Ngoc Suong-style), one of the great
festive meals of the Vietnamese repertoire, is brought out with the
fanfare of a royal court presentation by a parade of waiters. One
carries a huge platter holding the whole fish, garnished with frilly
lettuce and carved vegetables. Another brings more platters of fresh
produce: half a dozen aromatic herbs, lettuces and cut vegetables,
and green banana. A third sets down the plates of rice paper and
containers of the house dipping sauce.</TE>
<TE>   If a customer looks bewildered by the spectacle, the management
proudly demonstrates how to nudge chunks of moist fish from the
skeleton with a chopstick and wrap them with herbs and greens,
burrito-style, in the pliable disks of rice paper. One secret
ingredient that draws people back for this often-copied dish is the
kho -- the fine bittersweet caramel glaze on the fish.</TE>
<TE>   As you might imagine, ca dut lo serves at least four or five when
made with the smallest fish. Most other dishes serve two or more.</TE>
<TE>   A smaller presentation, but one filled with drama nonetheless, is
the lemon leaves-grilled chicken (listed as No. 23 under "Lunch")
with sticky rice and black beans "in a bamboo stick" (No. 24). You
dip the grilled chicken morsels into a bowl of sauce afloat with
flaming (yes, flaming) kaffir lime leaves. The bamboo tube comes to
the table with one end on fire. You put out the flame at your
leisure, remove the cork at one end and then remove the rice, which
has picked up a clear smoky flavor, with chopsticks. Dining hasn't
been this much fun since the flamed crepes suzette craze.</TE>
<TE>   The salads are absolutely spectacular. (They're randomly listed
under various menu headings, but don't despair; keep an eye out for
dishes with names containing the word goi).</TE>
<TE>   In the appetizer list, look for clam and sliced young banana
flower salad (No. 2). It's masses of chopped fresh herbs in a
tart-sweet dressing, strewn with crunchy deep-fried shallots and
crowned with a crimson "lipstick" pepper carved into the shape of a
flower. Goi dau que (No. 56), a refreshing tangle of shredded green
papaya tossed with crisp green beans, poached shrimp and roasted
pork, also gets that crunchy shallot garnish. Sole salad (No. 67) is
a sort of carpaccio: sliced raw fish sprinkled with crushed toasted
rice. Fold it up in rice paper with pungent herbs and you'll have
packets of explosive flavor.</TE>
<TE>   A fine counterpoint to the salads would be crab- and
shrimp-stuffed imperial roll, which has the scent of clean frying oil
and briny shellfish juices. Or consider crab and watercress soup -- a
broth tinged orange from crab roe, its delicate yet compelling
sweetness balanced by the bite of the "watercress" (actually, water
spinach) leaves. The whole crab dishes are quite tasty if you don't
mind all the pounding and sucking necessary to extract the meat from
messy, sauce-covered shells.</TE>
<TE>   The Euro part of Ngoc Song's menu offers dainty filet mignon with
three-peppercorn sauce, lamb chops slathered with a garlic reduction
and half a dozen other standard a la minute French-style dishes.
They're more than acceptable but not worth traveling a distance to
eat.</TE>
<TE>   That advice doesn't hold for the Euro-style desserts. The kitchen
turns out the most mango-y mango ice cream served stuffed into the
fruit's shell and a refined cappuccino- pecan-Grand Marnier truffle.
Both beckon from the center of Little Saigon's newest dining scene.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For Southern California gardeners, it is less the opening of holiday
season than tree planting season. The first rain has come, the soil
is soft and months of mild weather lie ahead of us. It is the perfect
time for settling in new fruit trees.</LD>
<LD>   So many places stock trees now that there is only one thing
between us and buying one the minute the notion crosses our mind.
Flavor. This year, why not choose a tree fruit-first?</LD>
<LD>   Too often we plant trees merely because we like the way they look.
Even with fruit trees, the tendency is to treat them like
ornamentals. Loquats and the striking gray-green guavas are among our
most common suburban fruit trees, but they produce fruits that are
far from our favorites. If we stop before we dig, plan before we
plant and consider which fruits we truly love, we can have it all:
beauty and bounty.</LD>
<TE>   It is mouthwatering homework, and one of the best nurseries to
start at is the San Gabriel Nursery &amp; Florist. There are kaffir limes
bearing the impossibly fragrant Thai equivalent of bay leaves, then
Snow Queen nectarines and Black Mission figs. Exotica lovers, note
well: There are oranges that are red and persimmons that are brown.</TE>
<TE>   But, a warning, for this first trip -- to any nursery -- leave the
checkbook and credit cards behind. Bring a checklist of questions and
a notepad, and as you tour the nursery's aisles, ask yourself: Do you
want a full-size tree, as tall as 30 feet high, or a dwarf, which is
more easily pruned and picked? Stone fruit trees particularly require
pruning every year.</TE>
<TE>   Or do you want to espalier your tree along a wall, a style
captured so beguilingly in paintings of medieval paradise gardens?</TE>
<TE>   Creating fruit hedges</TE>
<TE>   All this choice brings structural decisions. If you are choosing
dwarf trees, keep in mind that they bear fruit younger -- often two
years younger than standard trees. They commonly produce less
structural wood and more fruiting wood, and are ideal for creating
fruit hedges.</TE>
<TE>   But they also tend to be floppy and weak: Chances are good that
you will need to rig some trellising and for deciduous dwarfs, such
as apples, it helps if the trellising is pretty.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, remember the birds and the bees. Ask if your tree
needs a pollinator to bear fruit. Apples need a crab apple, a Hass
avocado benefits from a Fuerte pollinator. But before buying two
avocados, which can become enormous, peek over your neighbor's fence
and see if there isn't already a pollinator nearby.</TE>
<TE>   If you are going for more than one tree, creating a hedge or even
a mini-orchard, time your harvest. Do you want a sudden glut, or do
you want the fruit to start, say, with a June apricot, a July peach,
midseason August peach and conclude with the luscious "desert"
peaches, which ripen in September? Make sure you know whether your
tree is an "early," "mid" or "late" season type.</TE>
<TE>   By the time you've done all this and are checking the tree's
suitability to your climate zone, whether it fits your irrigation
system and how best to plant and water it, the nursery manager will
think he's heard every possible question. But, if you're planting a
stone fruit, you've got one more.</TE>
<TE>   Excuse me, sir, is the fruit from this tree free-stone or cling?</TE>

<LD>HEY, doesn't anybody order entrees anymore?</LD>
<LD>   Tapas-style restaurants have been popping up all over town the
last few years, and now three of the city's top restaurateurs are
bite-sizing.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, David Rosoff opened Opaline, a minimalist place on
Beverly Boulevard where Red once stood (but with a green color
scheme). Opaline has a special "small plates" menu in the lounge,
with nibbles like fried Chetti olives, chanterelle toast or braised
clams with artichoke. Prices hover around $6.</LD>
<TE>   Also on Wilshire, Steven Arroyo will open a Spanish wine bar this
Friday, Cobra Lily. It's an intimate, dimly lit place of red walls
and Spanish tile serving the sort of tapas (wild mushroom plate,
spiced olives, anchovies) familiar from Arroyo's Cobras &amp; Matadors,
at $3 to $7.</TE>
<TE>   And finally, the long-awaited "small plates" restaurant from
Suzanne Goin and Caroline Styne of Lucques will open Dec. 9. The
wine-oriented place, to be called A.O.C., will feature unusual
cheeses and its own charcuterie, such as country duck pate and pork
rillettes.</TE>
<TE>   Opaline, 7450 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles. (323) 857-6725.</TE>

<TE>   Keller names his N.Y. chef, and begins boot camp</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Keller still hasn't figured out what he's going to call his
restaurant in New York City, but he has decided who is going to be
the chef. Jonathan Benno, one of the opening crew at the French
Laundry in Napa Valley, will head up the operation, Keller says.
Benno, who has also worked at Manhattan restaurants including Daniel
and Craft, is back in Yountville for the next year, absorbing the
fine points of Keller's intricate style.</TE>
<TE>   The new restaurant, which is supposed to open next fall, is a
$6-million operation that will be in the AOL Time Warner tower going
up on Columbus Circle. The building will also house other high-end
restaurants, including the transplanted Beverly Hills Ginza Sushi-Ko.</TE>
<TE>   Keller says he'll put in a lot of time in New York at first, but
"I'm definitely not going to be bi-coastal," he says. "I will be
going back and forth when I'm needed. And I'll be there a lot in the
initial effort, the first six months, eight months or a year."</TE>
<TE>   While Keller is in New York, the French Laundry will be run by
executive chef Eric Zorn.</TE>
<TE>   As for the name, Keller says he's looking for one word that will
connect with New York tradition. "It's definitely not going to be the
French Laundry."</TE>

<TE>   Small bites</TE>
<TE>   Menemshaw, the latest venture from Brad Johnson (Georgia, Roxbury,
Sunset Room), opened last week. Named after a Martha's Vineyard town,
it's a casual spot offering New England fare from lobster rolls and
fried clams to Yankee pot roast.</TE>
<TE>   Menemshaw, 822 Washington Blvd., Venice, (310) 822-2550.</TE>
<TE>   Brooke Williamson has left the kitchen at Zax to begin catering.
Mario Perez, of Cafe Melisse in Valencia, has replaced her. "I want
to cater dinner parties and small cocktail parties," Williamson says,
"no weddings." For information, (310) 821-8991.</TE>

<KH>THE REVIEW</KH>
<HD>A lavish temple of promise</HD>
<DH>With its impressive pedigree and glamorous setting,Tantra
has potential to rise above standard Indian fare. But it starts off
tentatively.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ONE reason I can't wait to get back to London is the Indian food
there. At its best, it can be incredibly nuanced and elegant. In Los
Angeles, though, Indian restaurants are so much alike, few of them
stand out. And none are on the level of London's top restaurants like
Tamarind or Zaika, which rate a Michelin star.</LD>
<LD>   So it's easy to see why a lavish new restaurant in Silver Lake has
generated so much interest. Tantra, subtitled "Art of Indian
Cuisine," has the design savvy and sprawling layout of the latest
generation of L.A.'s restaurant-slash-clubs, and, better still, a
kitchen that promises the exotic with an updated Indian menu drawn
from the one at Zaika in London.</LD>
<LD>   Wedged between Cirxa and the venerable El Conquistador on Sunset
Boulevard, Tantra preens like the Taj Mahal. The doors are massive
copper surfaces pockmarked with age and set in an ornate frame. In
the foyer you get the first shock of color -- saffron yellow walls
inset with fuchsia glass cutouts. A stylized painted male/female face
looms over the host's station. Two potted palms -- male and female,
the host points out -- stand guardian at the door.</LD>
<TE>   To the left, past a narrow pool scattered with rose petals and
floating candles, is the dining room. Its satiny wood tables and
upholstered booths give it a smart contemporary look. Swaying from
the lofty ceiling, tall red silk lampshades trimmed in fringe soften
the room.</TE>
<TE>   To the right, the ballroom-sized lounge and bar is decorated in
the saturated colors of saris and spices -- cinnabar, indigo,
fuchsia, turmeric. Most nights an eclectic Silver Lake crowd settles
in, sipping fanciful cocktails with names like Shiva's Revenge or
Tears of Ganesha and snacking on small plates. The old
black-and-white Bollywood movies playing silently on plasma screens
are mesmerizing. I can't get enough of the disheveled Clark Gable
look-alike or the lavish Busby Berkeley-inspired dance routines.</TE>
<TE>   London lineage</TE>
<TE>   For me, Tantra's boho glamour (the work of designer Sat Garg) is
an unexpected bonus. What drew me was the Zaika connection. Tantra's
owner, Navraj Singh, is the cousin of Zaika's chef, Vineet Bhatia,
and because of the family connection, Bhatia consulted on Tantra's
menu. Tantra's chef is Sanjay Kumar.</TE>
<TE>   But despite its London lineage, the menu at the 3-month- old
restaurant disappointed me. It doesn't read radically different from
that at many Indian places around town, including Singh's other
restaurants. Zaika's food is much more sophisticated and upscale than
Tantra's -- and more innovative, too. Tantra's kitchen, however, has
lightened some dishes by substituting olive oil for the traditional
ghee (clarified butter).The quality of the ingredients is generally
high, too, with freshly ground spices woven through the subtle
curries and sauces.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it feels as if the owner or the kitchen lost courage at the
last minute and decided it would be less risky offering a more
familiar menu. And they might well be right. But why not try to push
the boundaries a bit more? (The fact that Tantra is doing an Indian
take on Thanksgiving is an encouraging sign, with dishes that pique
interest more than most things on the regular menu: turkey shish
kebabs with cranberry chutney, herb and spice roasted turkey stuffed
with morels and wild garlic leaves and served with corn and chile
naan.)</TE>
<TE>   For now, a wise strategy is to share starters -- maybe samosas in
a crisp thin wrapper filled with spinach and, surprise, tofu; a salad
of tiny potatoes laced with yogurt and a sweet/sour tamarind chutney
and green chicken tikka in a fragrant sauce of coriander, basil and
mint.</TE>
<TE>   A kebab of tandoori salmon glazed with honey is charred and smoky,
still moist at the center, but fried prawns in a spiky coat of broken
vermicelli are overcooked and dry. Mushy tandoori broccoli won't win
many converts either. Slathered in melted yellow cheese, it seems
like a distant cousin of Welsh rarebit. But do try the wonderful
scallops swimming in a bowl of chile-laced coconut milk scented with
lemon.</TE>
<TE>   An occasional dish is a revelation, such as the catfish masala --
smoky grilled catfish cloaked in coconut milk and an intricately
layered masala. The lamb biryani cooked under a crust arrives as a
sort of divine Indian pot pie layered with lamb and fluffy long
grains of basmati rice perfumed with spices. But chicken korma in a
pale, incredibly rich cashew nut sauce begins to cloy after a few
bites. And chicken tikka masala is dried out, its buttery tomato
sauce only a memory.</TE>
<TE>   Hidden treasures</TE>
<TE>   Some of the best dishes are to be found in the list of a la carte
vegetables. And those include fiery black lentils (dal) cooked
overnight in the heat retained by the tandoori oven and a milder
yellow dal laced with cumin and onion seeds. I can't stay away from
the okra stewed in tomatoes and herbs either.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, any northern Indian meal needs naan, the pillowy
flatbread cooked on the sides of the tandoori oven. I like it plain,
but you can get a garlic version and an oddly compelling one covered
pizza-style in molten cheese, onions and chiles.</TE>
<TE>   Desserts are pretty slapdash, mostly sticky sweet ice creams
(pistachio, mango and saffron), and an odd pineapple tandoori.
Sometimes the oven gives the pineapple an acrid, charred taste; once,
the fruit was so unripe, it tasted sour and bitter.</TE>
<TE>   Service is still a little shaky. Bread or the occasional dish may
be forgotten and there can be a long gap between courses. Likewise,
the kitchen has needed time to sort itself out.</TE>
<TE>   It's encouraging, though, that my last meal was by far the best.
I'm hoping that once the chef and his brigade settle in, he'll offer
more specials and be more daring with the menu. L.A. is ready for a
more sophisticated Indian restaurant, something closer to Zaika. And
with time it may turn out to be Tantra.</TE>

<LD>Dear SOS: I had a memorable meal at Americana, a restaurant in Del
Mar. I'd absolutely love to get the recipe for the roasted eggplant
and asparagus soup.</LD>
<LD>   Miriam Billington</LD>
<LD>   Santa Monica</LD>
<TE>   Dear Miriam: Randy Gruber, of Americana, sent this recipe. This
soup is worth making, though the height of asparagus and eggplant
seasons are past. Roasting the eggplant makes for a rich and
satisfying fall soup with a marvelous flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Roasted eggplant and asparagus soup</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1  1/2 hours</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 8-10</TE>
<TE>   3 medium eggplants, sliced in half lengthwise (about 4 pounds)</TE>
<TE>   3 cloves garlic, 1 split in half, 2 finely chopped; divided</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup olive oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   4 stalks celery, finely chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 red onion, finely chopped</TE>
<TE>   2 leeks, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   3 shallots, finely chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 cup white wine</TE>
<TE>   12 cups vegetable stock</TE>
<TE>   2 pounds medium asparagus, coarsely chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup pesto, fresh or store-bought</TE>
<TE>   1 cup shaved Parmesan (about 3 ounces)</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 400 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   2. Rub the eggplant halves with the cut clove of garlic, 2
tablespoons of the olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Place in
a baking dish and roast until the eggplant halves are browned and
have softened, about 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   3. Meanwhile, cook the celery, onion, leeks, shallots and chopped
garlic in a heavy pot with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil
over medium heat until translucent, 15 to 20 minutes. Add the white
wine and cook until all the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes.
Add the vegetable stock and continue to simmer.</TE>
<TE>   4. Peel the eggplant and add the flesh to the pot. Add the
asparagus and simmer until the asparagus is very tender, about 15
minutes. Add the pesto sauce. Puree the soup in batches in a blender
until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish each serving with
the shaved Parmesan.</TE>

<HD>BYOB, but it'll cost you</HD>
<DH>More people are bringing their own wine, and restaurants
are fighting back with tougher rules and corkage fees as high as $50.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Valli Herman-Cohen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High-END restaurants are losing patience. For years they've
accommodated diners who brought their own wine by charging them a
modest corkage fee to serve it. The practice hurt profits, but only a
few of the best customers tended to bring their own, so why worry?</LD>
<LD>   But lately -- and especially in Los Angeles, restaurateurs
complain -- this BYOB thing is out of control. More people are
bringing ever more bottles, and worse, they tote them in cheap paper
sacks, or lug in boxfuls of bargain-basement finds.</LD>
<LD>   In reaction, corkage fees are shooting up, from $10 or $15 to as
high as $50 a bottle. There are new rules: If your wine is on their
list, Firefly Bistro and L'Orangerie won't pour it. Dan Tana's
peculiar calculus multiplies bottle fees by the number of glasses
poured. Valentino forbids more than two bottles. Some places, such as
Bastide and the Ivy, won't let any wine through the door, period.</LD>
<TE>   It's a tricky issue on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to bring my own wine to restaurants all the time," said
Steve Wallace, owner of a Wally's Wine and Spirits, and a general
partner in restaurants including Capo in Santa Monica. "Now that I am
in the restaurant business, I don't," he said. "I know how most
restaurateurs feel about it. Most good restaurants that have good
wine lists do not like customers bringing their own bottle, unless
you buy something off of their list."</TE>
<TE>   Many restaurateurs agree that the first shot in the corkage war
was fired two years ago, by French Laundry chef Thomas Keller. He
hiked corkage in his Yountville restaurant in the Napa Valley from
$30 to $50 for a bottle not on his list -- and mailed a letter to
customers, explaining his philosophy on food, wine and economics.</TE>
<TE>   The French Laundry aims to provide a "tremendous culinary
adventure," he wrote, including his "approachable and inviting wine
menu." (The 51-page list has about two dozen $60-and-under bottles
and many $500, $1,000 and $2,500 bottles that by the sip are more
expensive than a sniff of illegal narcotics.)</TE>
<TE>   "While we graciously present our customers their wines utilizing
our wine service materials, we immediately take a loss due to lack of
sales," Keller continued. "Just as retail businesses, wineries and
other businesses need to sell their merchandise and services, so do
we."</TE>
<TE>   His message was clear and now other restaurateurs hope that steep
corkage fees send a sign -- a stop sign. Restaurateurs admit that the
BYOB crowd is relatively small: 3% to 5% of diners, although some,
including Patina, say it is up to 10%. Though some wine lovers bring
their own bottles to avoid high markups, others say bringing their
own lets them to share fine wine with friends, learn about new types
and, not infrequently, brandish their bottles as a sign of their good
taste and sophistication.</TE>
<TE>   But wine and liquor sales account for 30% or more of restaurant
profits. Some restaurateurs, particularly those with extensive,
expensive wine lists, look at those bottles and see not red wine, but
red ink.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a policy to discourage people from bringing their own
wine," said Mike Miljkovic, general manager of Dan Tana's, a West
Hollywood industry hangout that charges $6 per person per bottle to
pour outside wine. "You can't make any money on food at our type of
place," he said. "If you serve rice and beans, you can make money."</TE>
<TE>   Wine cellars represent a huge investment at some of L.A.'s best
restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a million dollars sleeping downstairs," said maitre d'
Stephane Clasquin of the cellar at L'Orangerie, West Hollywood's
French institution.</TE>
<TE>   Wine and liquor sales are the most profitable part of his and most
menus. "Fifteen people work in the kitchen just to make sometimes one
dish," Clasquin said. "People need to understand that in order for us
to have 12-foot flower arrangements in the middle of the dining room,
we need to have some revenues. I'm sorry to say that, but to me, if
the restaurateurs were all holding hands and saying, 'No, we can't do
that,' the restaurants would be in a better economic position."</TE>
<TE>   Money's not the only issue; class counts too. "One day," sniffed
Clasquin, a person is going to come with a steak and say, 'Cook it
for me medium.' "</TE>
<TE>   His attitude isn't hard to justify in Los Angeles, land of the
peculiar food fanatic. Even by bringing a $45 bottle that might list
for $120 in a restaurant, it's hard not to look cheap -- even when
you pay corkage -- or worse, uninformed.</TE>
<TE>   Putting three to the test</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, I brought three bottles of fairly uncommon
reds to three restaurants known for their wine lists. When I
presented my 1999 Cascina Val del Prete Nebbiolo d'Alba to the waiter
at Angelini Osteria, I complimented the restaurant's fine, deep list
and affordable selections. The waiter politely offered to sell me a
bottle of his Nebbiolo, as well as the $40 pasta dish with white
truffles from the same Italian region as the wine. For the $15
corkage on my $16 bottle, my guest and I were given proper red wine
stemware and a friendly uncorking, but were left to top our glasses.</TE>
<TE>   At Cafe Bizou in Sherman Oaks, where the $2 corkage fee has long
been a draw for wine aficionados, the waiter didn't try to push his
own, modest list of 18 fairly common reds over my $23 1999 La
Mauriane Puisseguin-Saint-Emilion. In our far corner of the bustling
dining room, we rarely saw the waiter and were left to pour our own
most of the time.</TE>
<TE>   But at Capo, the $25 fee paid for the most and best service -- and
Spiegelau crystal stems, which our attentive waiter kept filled with
our $40 1997 Amarone Della Valpolicella. Surprised by seeing the
corkage policy on the opening page of the large wine list, I asked
chef Bruce Marder how he felt about people bringing their own
bottles.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to sell wine," he said matter-of-factly, adding that
the policy is printed on the list to also help diners avoid potential
embarrassment. Yet later that night, Marder had to tell a customer
that he'd have to pay $25 to be served his $15 bottle of wine. He
also has witnessed customers toting half a dozen bottles for a large
party.</TE>
<TE>   Marder isn't one to hide from his customers or their questions.
During our multi-course tasting menu, he frequently fielded our
inquiries about ingredients and preparations, a good sign that he
would do the same if we asked about his wines. Some wine stewards
will also seize the opportunity to educate diners about the wine they
brought with them, and the others on their list. It can build
business.</TE>
<TE>   Cafe Bizou co-owner Neil Rogers said he'll probably keep the
corkage fee at $2 because, "We want our customers to come and have a
good time and not feel like they've been robbed."</TE>
<TE>   Though corkage is $25 at Mastro's Steakhouse in Beverly Hills,
bringing a personal bottle isn't otherwise discouraged. "I think an
evening of wine should be like an evening of going to Disneyland,"
said Jonathan Way, Mastro's sommelier. "I like to make the experience
fun, playful and educational.</TE>
<TE>   "People are afraid of wine because of the pretension that has been
a part of the wine business for so long," Way continued. "Sommeliers
have been somewhat to blame for not being a bit more relaxed in their
approach to the guests, to the consumer of wine."</TE>
<TE>   At 32 years old, Way is in tune with the crowd that is the wine
industry's only hope for growth. When the Wine Market Council studied
the paltry wine-drinking habits of 25- to 37-year-olds, the trade
group saw dry years ahead -- if the industry doesn't attempt to
engage them now. But not only are the higher fees, restrictive
policies and high prices discouraging future customers, they're in
danger of alienating current ones.</TE>
<TE>   Tough customers</TE>
<TE>   "I know of very few restaurants today that have more diners than
they can handle," said David Kegaries, vice president of the Southern
California chapter of the Society of Wine Educators. If he encounters
what he considers an unjustifiably high corkage, he won't open his
bottle, and frequently, he won't return to the restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "If you go into a restaurant and the cheapest bottle of white wine
is $30, it's generally a chardonnay that wholesales for less than
$10," Kegaries said. "Why experiment when it's so expensive?"</TE>
<TE>   As a wine expert, Kegaries and his society colleagues meet in
restaurants to share great food and their unusual finds. "It becomes
a reason to go out and get together," he said, adding, "You can't get
aged wines in most restaurants."</TE>
<TE>   The issue gets especially touchy because the customers most likely
to bring wine to restaurants are knowledgeable about vintages, prices
and the quality of the lists. They can't be fooled.</TE>
<TE>   When celebrating Mother's Day about five years ago, Bel-Air
orthopedic surgeon Eugene Osher saw that the special $75 bottle he'd
brought to drink at Patina was on the wine list -- for $900. Such
markups are straining credibility and patron relations.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the restaurants are sending a message that their
economics come first before my enjoyment and entertainment," said
Joseph Folender, a Venice philanthropist and wine collector. "They've
got to make a living, and I respect that, so I never mind paying
corkage, as long as I can bring my own wine."</TE>
<TE>   Sharing the wealth</TE>
<TE>   Paying corkage allows Folender to share superior wines, such as a
1966 Chateau Haut-Brion, without burdening his dining companions'
budgets. "People say to me, 'Joe, you pick out the wine.' I don't
want to put my hand in their pocket. I don't want anyone on the
receiving end of a $100 bottle," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To celebrate a special occasion at Capo last week, L.A. lawyer
Byron Moldo brought two bottles of wine from his cellar, partly to
avoid the mystery of drinking an unfamiliar vintage. He advocates
reasonable corkage fees, for his benefit and the restaurant's. "For
purposes of repeat business, I think it does the restaurant a
service," Moldo said. "People will recommend the place."</TE>
<TE>   As if learning about wine isn't already a challenge, so is
negotiating the corkage practices and the intimidating attitude that
seeps from sommeliers and waiters. Undeterred, L.A. diners persist in
their preference for BYOB policies, unlike restaurant patrons in
other cities. "If you walk into a major restaurant in New York City
with a bottle of wine, in most instances, they would ask you not to,
or to leave," said Wallace. "In Europe, the same thing happens."</TE>
<TE>   For now, even though many better restaurants are hoping to
discourage the bring-your-own practice, some have reached a sort of
compromise in manners and economics. "If you're a sophisticated
diner," said Wallace, "you call the restaurant, ask them their policy
beforehand and buy a bottle off the list too." Just be sure you've
got a designated driver.</TE>

<KH>MATTERS OF TASTE / David Shaw</KH>
<HD>How to have your wine -- and keep the sommelier happy too</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Shaw</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I take my own wine to most restaurants most of the time.</LD>
<LD>   Most restaurants don't like that; it cuts into their profits. But
after more than 10 years' experience, I think I've learned how to do
it without taking advantage or giving undue offense. In fact, I think
there's a certain etiquette to bringing your own wine.</LD>
<LD>   My first rule: Bring something good -- something different,
something interesting.</LD>
<TE>   A special bottle -- a wine from your birth year, say -- is nice
but not essential. Nor do you have to take some $300 cult Cabernet or
20-year-old Bordeaux. But you shouldn't just wander into Trader
Joe's, pick up a $6.99 special and expect a nice restaurant to greet
you with open arms.</TE>
<TE>   I also think you should bring something appropriate to the
restaurant. Don't take an $8 Beaujolais to a fine-dining restaurant
with an excellent wine list. And don't walk into a restaurant with a
party of six and a shopping bag full of wine.</TE>
<TE>   "About twice a week, we have people come in with six or eight
bottles," says Chris Meeske, the sommelier at Patina restaurant, "and
that means I'm stuck at their table, opening and pouring wines most
of the night, and service in the rest of the restaurant suffers."</TE>
<TE>   When possible, it seems to me, you should try to avoid bringing a
wine that the restaurant is likely to have on its list. The only
excuse for doing so is that your bottle is cheaper, and I don't think
that's sufficient reason by itself, unless the restaurant is truly
extortionist in its pricing.</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to know in advance what wines a restaurant has on
its list, of course, but if you bring something that isn't in current
release or that's a bit out of the ordinary, you'll usually be OK. I
generally bring two bottles, just so I can have an alternate if my
first choice shows up on their list.</TE>
<TE>   The case for bringing your own</TE>
<TE>   Why do I take my own wine to so many restaurants?</TE>
<TE>   Several reasons.</TE>
<TE>   The most obvious:</TE>
<TE>   I'm often outraged by the prices I see on restaurant wine lists. I
realize they have to pay for rent, storage, stemware and a sommelier
-- and to compensate for money they've spent on wine waiting to be
consumed. But too many restaurants mark their wines up way too much,
and I object to wine lists that resemble ransom notes. My daddy
didn't raise me to throw my money away.</TE>
<TE>   Also, I've found that my friends appreciate my bringing wine. They
know I've picked it with their particular likes and dislikes in mind
-- and it eliminates the time-consuming and, to some, embarrassing
and intimidating ritual of consulting around the table about who
likes what and how much each of us is prepared to spend.</TE>
<TE>   Most important to me, the vast majority of restaurants carry only
current or very recent vintages; I like wines -- even white wines --
with some bottle age, and having bought wine steadily, if modestly,
since 1982, I have a fair amount of mature, ready-to-drink wine.
Besides, having picked each bottle in my cellar personally, I know
that if I take one of them, I'll be able to drink something that I
like and that will work well with whatever I'm going to eat.</TE>
<TE>   Don't get me wrong. I like to experiment with wines I don't know,
and at restaurants with good, fairly priced wine lists, I either
leave my wine home or we drink one of theirs and one of mine. But
such restaurants, alas, are the exception these days.</TE>
<TE>   Most restaurants will waive the corkage fee if you also drink a
bottle from their list. Some will also waive it if you're a regular
customer or if you give your waiter or sommelier a taste of what
you've brought.</TE>
<TE>   Although some restaurants have such good, reasonably priced wine
lists that they consider it a personal affront when customers bring
in wine, current economic conditions have forced most of them to
swallow that resentment, however justified it might be.</TE>
<TE>   "My attitude used to be, 'How dare you bring your own wine into my
temple of wine,' " says Piero Selvaggio, whose Valentino restaurant
in Santa Monica has more than 125,000 bottles -- more than 6,000
different wines, many in multiple, older vintages, from France and
California as well as Italy, ranging in price from $21 to $9,000 a
bottle. Valentino's 155-page list has almost 100 wines for $35 or
less--and there are eight pages of half-bottles.</TE>
<TE>   "Still, I've had to modify my attitude," Selvaggio says. "Now I
figure I'd rather have you here, even with your own wine, at least
eating our food, instead of having that table empty."</TE>
<TE>   Selvaggio charges $35 a bottle corkage, though he usually waives
it for people in the wine trade and for those who also order a bottle
from his list. He makes other exceptions as well, but he still gets
angry on occasion.</TE>
<TE>   "If you bring in a Ruffino Chianti that you bought for $8, I'm
going to charge you the full $35 corkage because I'm insulted," he
says. "I spend $2 million on wine, and you bring that bottle in?"</TE>
<TE>   A profitable twist</TE>
<TE>   What's a fair corkage charge? I think it should be the equivalent
of the cheapest wine on the restaurant's list.</TE>
<TE>   Manfred Krankl -- chairman of the board of La Brea Bakery, former
general manager of Campanile restaurant and himself a highly regarded
winemaker under the Sine Qua Non label -- thinks $10 to $15 is
plenty.</TE>
<TE>   I wouldn't object to somewhat higher charges in some high-end
restaurants, but Krankl, the most enlightened restaurant/wine person
I know on the subject, says corkage is "pure profit," and high
corkage "penalizes a restaurant's best customers. It's very stupid to
make a problem out of people bringing their own wine or to have
really high corkage charges."</TE>
<TE>   "Restaurants should realize that people who bring wine ... usually
spend the most on food," he says. "They probably order dessert and
maybe a cognac, and they come back again and again. That's where your
long-term profits are."</TE>
<TE>   Krankl is certainly right about all my wine-toting friends. We eat
out often and frequent those restaurants that welcome our wines. None
of us is a "We'll split the main course" kind of diner. Most of us
order appetizers, entrees and desserts -- sometimes multiple
desserts, often a more expensive chef's tasting menu. Speaking for my
wife and myself, we almost always start with a Chivas Regal (for her)
and a glass of Champagne (for me), so restaurants certainly profit
from our visits -- and from their enlightened corkage policies.</TE>
<TE>   Given that most restaurateurs say that only 3% to 5% of their
customers bring wine, I think those who do not have such policies are
making a big mistake. But I think diners sometimes make a mistake,
too; when it comes time to leave a tip, they don't take into account
having brought their own wine.</TE>
<TE>   The waiter has to do the same amount of work opening and pouring
the wine, whether it's your bottle or the restaurant's, and it's not
his fault if the restaurant's wine list is too limited, overpriced or
under-aged.</TE>
<TE>   So I try to determine approximately what I would have spent if I'd
bought a bottle at the restaurant and add 20% of that to the 20% tip
I'd leave for everything else.</TE>
<TE>   If the restaurant charges corkage, I might reduce my supplemental
tip accordingly. But if the waiter has been especially attentive, I
usually don't deduct anything. I think the extra few dollars probably
means more to the waiter than it does to me, and I'd rather err on
the side of generosity than parsimony.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line on the bring-your-own-wine issue, as with so much
in life, is: Be reasonable, respectful and fair. Use common sense. I
think that's pretty good advice for diners and restaurants alike.</TE>

<HD>Behold a blazing beauty</HD>
<DH>The pomegranate is the jewel of fall, bestowing not only
its radiant color but a unique flavor upon dishes sweet and savory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Donna Deane</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FOR all its virtues, the pomegranate doesn't exactly reach out and
grab the cook. It doesn't release a burst of fragrance, the way a
lemon or an orange does the instant the knife pierces its skin.
There's no inspiring rush of juice like the nectar of a peach or fig.
None of the evocative crunch of an apple.</LD>
<LD>   But it's fall. They're in season. And they're so beautiful. So, we
began to experiment. And our first effort -- a creamy orange
cheesecake covered with an impossibly red pomegranate glaze and
sparkling seeds -- confirmed our hunch: This is one seriously
neglected fruit.</LD>
<LD>   Next we used the seeds to garnish a spongecake frosted with a rich
pomegranate molasses butter cream. Topped with toasted walnuts and
strewn with the ruby seeds, it was another real looker of a dessert.
Pomegranate molasses -- which is actually just the concentrated
juice, sold in specialty markets and well-stocked supermarkets --
gives the sweet, thick frosting a unique flavor.</LD>
<TE>   We didn't stop at dessert. Our pomegranate chicken, which
marinates overnight in pomegranate molasses and seasonings, is served
with a sauce made from white wine, butter and pomegranate molasses.
It was a sophisticated dish, and it came together in less than an
hour.</TE>
<TE>   Choosing pomegranates is easy. Buy deeply colored, large fruits
that are heavy for their size. Store them in the refrigerator for up
to two months or on the counter for a few days.</TE>
<TE>   To remove the seeds, roll the pomegranate on a cutting board,
pressing down slightly. Then score the leathery skin into quarters
and submerge it in a bowl of cold water. Gently break open the
pomegranate and separate the seeds from the pith. The pith will float
to the top of the bowl, and can be easily scooped off.</TE>
<TE>   Be sure to keep the fruit under water as you work, to prevent it
from squirting on you and your clothing. For all its virtues, the
pomegranate can make an indelible mess.</TE>

<TE>   Pomegranate-glazed orange cheesecake</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 1/2 hours, plus 4 hours chilling</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 10-12</TE>
<TE>   Note: This pretty cheesecake is from Mayi Brady of The Times' Test
Kitchen. To toast almonds, heat a dry skillet and add the nuts,
shaking the skillet often, for about 5 minutes. Look for pomegranate
juice with the refrigerated juices in well-stocked supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   Crust</TE>
<TE>   1 cup vanilla wafer crumbs</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup ground toasted almonds</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons sugar</TE>
<TE>   5 tablespoons butter, melted</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   2. Combine the vanilla wafers, almonds, sugar and melted butter in
a bowl. Press the mixture onto the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.</TE>
<TE>   3. Bake the crust until just very lightly golden, about 10
minutes. Remove from the oven and let come to room temperature.</TE>
<TE>   Cake</TE>
<TE>   2 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</TE>
<TE>   1 (8-ounce) tub mascarpone</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   4 eggs</TE>
<TE>   Grated zest of 1 orange</TE>
<TE>   1. Beat the cream cheese, mascarpone and sugar in a mixing bowl on
medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Beat in the cream
and then the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl
between each egg. Stir in the zest. Pour into the cooled crust.</TE>
<TE>   2. Place the springform pan inside a larger pan filled with about
1 inch of water. Bake the cake until the center is still a little
soft but the edges are set and the top is lightly browned, 60 to 70
minutes. Let the cake cool to room temperature, then chill at least 4
hours.</TE>
<TE>   Glaze</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons cornstarch</TE>
<TE>   2 cups pomegranate juice, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons pomegranate seeds</TE>
<TE>   1. Stir the cornstarch into 2 tablespoons of the pomegranate juice
and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   2. Bring the remaining pomegranate juice and sugar to a boil in a
saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook
until the liquid has reduced to 3/4 cup, about 20 minutes. Stir in
the juice-cornstarch mixture and simmer 2 minutes to thicken.</TE>
<TE>   3. Let the glaze come to room temperature, then pour over the
chilled cheesecake. Garnish with the pomegranate seeds.</TE>

<TE>   Pan-fried pomegranate chicken</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 40 minutes, plus 8 hours marinating</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 4</TE>
<TE>   Note: From Mayi Brady of The Times' Test Kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Marinade</TE>
<TE>   10 cloves garlic, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 onion, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/3cup olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 chicken (about 3 1/2- 4 pounds), cut into 8 pieces</TE>
<TE>   1. Combine the garlic, onion, olive oil, thyme, pomegranate
molasses, salt and pepper to taste in a bowl. Pour into a large
resealable plastic bag. Add the chicken pieces and seal tightly.
Marinate in the refrigerator overnight.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup flour</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup ( 1/2 stick) butter, divided</TE>
<TE>   4 cloves garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 large shallot, minced</TE>
<TE>   2 sprigs fresh thyme</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups dry white wine</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups chicken broth</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons pomegranate molasses</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons pomegranate seeds</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Remove the chicken from the
marinade and discard the marinade.</TE>
<TE>   2. Place the flour in a shallow dish and season with salt and
pepper to taste.</TE>
<TE>   3. Heat the oil and 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet
over medium-high heat. Dredge the chicken pieces in the flour,
shaking off any excess. Cook the chicken, turning once or twice,
until golden brown but not cooked through, about 15 minutes. Remove
the chicken to a baking sheet and finish cooking the chicken in the
oven until it has cooked through, about 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   4. Meanwhile, add the garlic, shallot and thyme to the skillet and
cook on medium-high heat, stirring, just until fragrant, about 1
minute. Add the wine, increase the heat to high and cook, stirring up
any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet, until the liquid is
reduced to about 1/2 cup, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken broth and
pomegranate molasses. Cook until the liquid is reduced to about 1 1/4
cups, about 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   5. Strain the sauce into a clean saucepan over medium-low heat.
Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, one at a time, swirling
the pan to blend the butter in, rather than stirring it.</TE>
<TE>   6. Serve the chicken with the sauce and garnish with the
pomegranate seeds.</TE>

<HD>Solving the riddle of the duck</HD>
<DH>There's one answer to getting the whole bird just right.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Russ Parsons</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IF the hottest part of summer is the dog days, the first few weeks of
fall are my duck days. There is no better way to spend a cool foggy
day than in the kitchen, and I can imagine no better companion for
that than one of those billed birds, or maybe two or three.</LD>
<LD>   This might surprise some people. Duck suffers from a difficult
reputation, at least culinarily. Too many sweet-and-sour duck a
l'oranges at indifferent restaurants. Too many attempts at roasting a
duck at home that ended up stringy and greasy.</LD>
<LD>   But this is a fault of the cook, not of the bird. Give me a duck,
and I'll give you a meal. Give me several, and we can invite friends.
In fact, I did this just the other day. Three ducks turned into four
courses for 10 people. And all without the benefit of fuzzy
accounting.</LD>
<TE>   There are two main problems with ducks. First, the legs and the
breast meat are so radically different. The breast meat is tender
and, to my taste, perfect when cooked to about medium-rare. The legs
are the opposite, stringy and full of tendons that need to be well
cooked before they soften.</TE>
<TE>   This is one reason roast duck is so often disappointing: If you
get the breasts right, the legs are going to be downright inedible.
But if you cook to the legs, you'll wind up with a dried-out breast.</TE>
<TE>   The other problem with ducks is that they contain a remarkable
amount of fat, most of it located just under the skin. If you're not
careful, you'll wind up with a spattering mess in the oven and a
dinner that's dripping in grease.</TE>
<TE>   The most delicious solution to both these problems is to look at a
duck not as a single piece of meat, but as a collection of parts, the
sum of which is much greater than the whole. This involves a little
work and a bit of time, but hey, it's a fall weekend, what else do
you have to do?</TE>
<TE>   First, you catch your duck. The best place to find them is at
Asian markets. For some reason, fresh duckling that is an $8-a-pound
luxury at a Western grocery sells for less than $2 a pound in an
Asian one. Best of all, the ducks will usually come with their heads
and feet attached (why this is a good thing, I'll explain later).</TE>
<TE>   If you're not up for the full deal, many Asian markets also sell
fresh duck legs. What they do with the breasts, I don't know, but
I've got a suspicion they will probably be appearing soon at a fancy
restaurant near you.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing goes to waste</TE>
<TE>   The next step is to separate it into its respective parts. Take
the breast filets from the carcass. Do this by cutting down the
length of the breast right next to the central "keel" bone. Gently
pull away the breast meat, scraping along the ribs with a sharp knife
whenever the meat sticks. Score the breasts lightly on the skin side,
cutting through the skin but not to the meat. This will help drain
away the fat during cooking. Season with salt, pepper and some minced
rosemary, cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate.</TE>
<TE>   Cut off the legs and peel away the skin and any visible fat. Start
the legs braising, then cut the skin and fat into rough 2-inch
squares and place them in a saucepan.</TE>
<TE>   Remove as much skin and fat as possible from the rest of the
carcass and add it to the saucepan too. The neck is particularly rich
in fat, one reason it's good to shop at an Asian market.</TE>
<TE>   What is left will be primarily bones. Put them in a roasting pan
with a couple of carrots and an onion and roast at 400 to 450 degrees
until everything is well browned, about an hour. After roasting, put
everything in a stockpot, add enough water to cover and set it to
simmer for the rest of the afternoon to make a good strong broth.
Don't forget to add the feet, which are rich in gelatin and will add
body to the liquid.</TE>
<TE>   What about the fat? Now we're getting to the good part. Add about
half a cup of water to the saucepan and set it over medium heat.
Shortly after it comes to a simmer, you will begin to hear a
sputtering. At that point, the water will have evaporated, and all
that will be left in the pan is pure fat and the skin that's cooking
in it.</TE>
<TE>   Let the fat continue to cook until the bits of skin are
well-browned and crisp. Scoop them out with a slotted spoon, sprinkle
with fine salt and drain on some paper towels. These are like duck
chicharrones (you might call them "quacklings").</TE>
<TE>   Cool the fat and decant it into a large jar. You may be amazed at
how much fat results from this process. With just three ducks, I
ended up with a full quart of duck fat. Be sure you use a really
large jar. This is one of the sublime cooking fats -- duck is to
southern France what bacon is to Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Now the work is done. The rest of the meal is mainly garnish.</TE>
<TE>   One duck, several courses</TE>
<TE>   Serve the broth first, perhaps with some tiny boiled turnips. Then
come the stewed legs, served on polenta or lightly buttered pasta.</TE>
<TE>   Grill the breasts, skin-side first for about 12 to 14 minutes,
then on the meaty side for another six to eight. Slice them
crosswise, cutting them on the bias to show as much of the meat as
possible and serve the slices around the outside of the platter with
some kind of braised bitter greens (maybe the turnip tops?) in the
center.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, toss the duck cracklings with a variety of sturdy
lettuces and dress the whole thing with red wine vinegar and just a
little olive oil.</TE>
<TE>   I'm thinking a big California Chardonnay for the broth (one of the
few foods it pairs really well with), a Zinfandel or Barbera for the
ragu and then a Pinot Noir or Barolo for the breast and to linger
with over the salad. For dessert, anything more than sorbet or fresh
fruit would be overkill.</TE>
<TE>   Forget paradise, just give me a fall day with a duck.</TE>

<TE>   Duck ragu</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 3 1/2 hours</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 6-8</TE>
<TE>   Note: Serve this on polenta or fresh or dried pasta that you have
dressed with a little butter after cooking. Sprinkle with a little
grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.</TE>
<TE>   4 duck legs (about 1 3/4 pounds)</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1 onion, finely chopped</TE>
<TE>   2 cloves garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   About 1 cup red wine</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup tomato paste</TE>
<TE>   1 (28-ounce) can whole tomatoes, drained</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary</TE>
<TE>   1-2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1. Peel the skin from the duck legs and set it aside for another
use. Salt the duck legs lightly on both sides and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   2. Choose a Dutch oven or a heavy covered pan that is just big
enough to hold the duck legs in one layer. Combine the onion, garlic
and olive oil in the pan over medium-low heat. Cover and cook,
stirring once or twice, until the onions have thoroughly softened,
but are not brown, about 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   3. Lay the duck legs on top of the bed of onions and add just
enough red wine to barely cover them halfway. Lay a sheet of foil
directly on top of the duck and press it to the sides of the pan to
create a loose seal. Cover tightly and cook over low heat until the
duck meat is falling off the bone, about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours. The
heat should be low enough that the liquid barely bubbles. Turn the
legs once or twice to make sure they cook evenly.</TE>
<TE>   4. Remove the legs from the pan, set them aside, and increase the
heat to high. Cook until the wine has reduced to just below the top
of the onions, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and continue
cooking over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the paste
has thickened again and is a dark brick red, almost brown, 15 to 20
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   5. Chop the canned tomatoes, drain them again and add to the pan.
Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is a dark red and has
thickened so that rather than a quiet simmer, it makes distinct
popping sounds when the cooking bubbles burst, 20 to 25 minutes. It
will want to stick a little during the last 10 minutes, so stir more
frequently then.</TE>
<TE>   6. While the tomatoes are cooking, remove the duck meat from the
bones and shred it into large chunks. Discard the bones. When the
tomatoes are done, add the meat and the rosemary, replace the foil
and close tightly with the lid. Reduce the heat to low and cook until
the sauce is quite thick and the meat begins to pull apart in strings
when it is stirred, about 30 minutes. Just before serving, stir in
the red wine vinegar and salt to taste.</TE>

<DH>Fantasy camp brings in-their-dreams rockers together with
pros.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Baker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first time promoter David Fishof organized the Rock 'n' Roll
Fantasy Camp, Jay Leno suggested you could get a better return on
your five thousand bucks by checking into the Betty Ford Center,
where you'd be certain to meet a higher caliber of rock star.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, the second time Fishof held the event, he bumped up
against another taunting celebrity: Homer Simpson. In the season
premiere of "The Simpsons," which aired on the camp's opening night,
Homer attended a rock 'n' roll fantasy camp at which fans were drawn
to every manner of rock vanity, right down to the ethos of stuffing
your pants to attract groupies.</LD>
<LD>   The programming coincidence underscored the way many people sneer
at the idea of blowing the family vacation budget on Dad's midlife
crisis. But a funny thing happens when you walk into a cavernous
rehearsal studio in Hollywood where Fishof's 2002 camp has attracted
70 ax-slinging and drum-pounding true believers from Delaware to Ohio
to Florida: Homer Simpson's not here.</LD>
<TE>   Jim Mitchell is.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell, who works in insurance, is one of those guys who loves
to play -- with bands, in church, any time. His instrument is the
electric bass, and he plays it with a precise zest. "Music is where I
live," he says without a hint of pretense. "I have to do it." You can
consider him Exhibit A in the case for why the Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy
Camp has a certain goofy nobility that transcends "The Simpsons."</TE>
<TE>   On TV Sunday, Marge Simpson drove Homer to camp after he
embarrassed her with another self-destructive bender rooted in his
failure to realize his youthful dreams (rock star or Playboy
photographer). In the real world, Mitchell's wife, Rose, conned him
into driving from their Mount Washington home to the Hyatt hotel in
West Hollywood, telling him they were going to a wine-tasting dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Once inside the hotel, Rose sprung it on him: Jim was going to be
a camper as a 47th birthday present. One floor up from the front
desk, Fishof's resident pros -- mostly sidemen who've played with
everybody from Joe Walsh to Billy Joel -- were conducting auditions
to check each participant's skill level.</TE>
<TE>   Two hours later, Mitchell was going eye to eye with Joel's
drummer, Liberty DeVitto, in a five-minute jazz improvisation. Four
hours after that he was playing with other pros at a party set up at
a pricey guitar shop. The next afternoon he was inside SIR studios on
Sunset Boulevard, thrown together with half a dozen other amateurs,
singing "Mustang Sally" as his new mates began getting ready for the
camp's climax: a performance at the House of Blues Thursday night, in
which every camper will get time onstage.</TE>
<TE>   In six other rooms of the rehearsal studio, knots of campers were
reveling in the same pressure under the tutelage of pros like Mark
Farner, ex-lead singer and guitarist of Grand Funk Railroad;
singer-saxophonist Mark Rivera, a longtime member of Joel's band;
organist-guitarist Bobby Mayo, who toured with Peter Frampton;
guitarist Derek St. Holmes, who played with Ted Nugent; and bassist
Jack Blades, who fronted Night Ranger.</TE>
<TE>   A sudden celebrity</TE>
<TE>   "Idon't think I've taken a full breath since I've been here," said
Mitchell, whose prowess (and the camp's short supply of bass players)
made him a quick celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   In Homer's fantasy camp, guitarist Brian Setzer demonstrated the
key art of setting your guitar afire, while Mick Jagger reminded
campers to routinely proclaim tonight's audience "the wildest ever."
In the real-world fantasy camp, there was little time for
dilettantism. People were simply dying to play.</TE>
<TE>   In that sense, the Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp felt like its model,
the major league baseball fantasy camp, where aging fans play ball
with their aging heroes. The difference is that time is kinder to
musicians' muscles (Fishof's camp counselors effortlessly sound like
the world's greatest wedding band during nightly jam sessions).
Though a couple campers showed up with zero chops, most walked in
with the ability (if not the nerve) to stand up and play. When Farner
demonstrated the sustained "power G" chord, they could do it.</TE>
<TE>   Farner, 54, whose fame came half a lifetime ago, says he takes
pleasure now in connecting with people he knows are nervous just
being in the same room, letting them know "I'm just as fragile as
they are." They tend to be people like Bill Perry, a 39-year-old
Chatsworth Web site designer who played guitar on and off most of his
adult life and aspires only "to play in a crappy little blues band
that plays in stinky little bars on Tuesday night." Or Mike Darpino,
42, a government bond broker from New York City who plays a muscular
lead guitar. ("I've done a lot worse things with my money.... I could
do this every year. I don't want to eat now. I just wanna play.") Or
Lynn Mullings, 34, of Jupiter, Fla., the mother of a 1-year-old and
lover of '80s music who sent herself here as "my little reminder that
I'm a real person and not just somebody's mommy."</TE>
<TE>   The basic drill here involves breaking up into seven bands
(suffering from an oversupply of guitarists and drummers), rehearsing
up to six hours a day on three songs (two cover versions, one
original) that will make up the House of Blues show. Fender, one of
the camp's corporate sponsors, has stacked Stratocasters like
doughnuts for the campers who didn't bring their own guitars. In
between rehearsals, Fishof has hired B-level rock celebs like George
Thorogood and Dave Davies to visit with war stories, tips and the
inevitable jams.</TE>
<TE>   Most campers are in their 30s or 40s, with a smattering of those
in their 50s and a pair of 17-year-olds, including a rosy-cheeked
guitar whiz named Ed Hill, who won the trip in a Chicago radio talent
contest.</TE>
<TE>   When Hill cut loose with a series of Jimi Hendrix-like riffs
during Sunday's auditions, Russell Jeffries, the chief executive of a
Virginia high-tech company who was taking his first vacation in eight
years, feigned exasperation at somebody so good so young.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got socks older than that kid!"</TE>
<TE>   Jeffries, 45, who collected the pros' autographs on a newly bought
white Fender, shared with many campers a reborn love of the
instrument: Many of them had been in bands when they were younger,
started careers, ran out of time and then began rekindling the hobby,
sometimes finding new collaborators with the same history.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I plug the guitar in, the rest of the world fades away,"
Jeffries said. "There could be arterial bleeding. If the amps are on,
I don't care."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Jonke, 38-year-old tax assessor in Putnam County, N.Y., said
he wound up here once his guitar became a therapy tool. He broke up
with his fiancee after an argument about the size of her wedding ring
("she wanted four carats") and spent the money on the fantasy camp.</TE>
<TE>   Another camper, Fred Ricart, a Florida car dealer with a love of
collecting vintage guitars, prides himself on a showroom where
salesmen are free to carry their axes.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Simpsons" fantasy camp, Homer and his gang trashed Tom
Petty's serious lecture on songwriting, caring only about lyrics
involving sex and booze. In the real camp, Poison's Bret Michaels and
ex-Kinks guitarist Davies were afforded rapt silence as they
described the mechanics of turning heartache into song.</TE>
<TE>   Michaels, whose music is more popularly associated with
debauchery, described having his heart broken by a cheating stripper
after finishing a disappointing gig, then sitting in a coin laundry
with the cheap acoustic guitar of his childhood and composing "Every
Rose Has Its Thorn." Davies went him one better, retelling a 30-year
estrangement from a teen love that filtered into more than a dozen of
his songs.</TE>
<TE>   The second time around</TE>
<TE>   Fishof organized the first fantasy camp in Florida in 1997,
intending it to be an annual event. But then he began promoting Ringo
Starr's annual "All-Star" tour and the camp withered. When Starr took
2002 off, Fishof decided to try it again at $4,950 per head. "I lost
a ton of money the first time," he said. "I'd do better with a tall
men's shop in Tokyo."</TE>
<TE>   Homer Simpson is allowed only to be a roadie for the Rolling
Stones in his fantasy camp. By contrast, late in Monday night's camp
jam session, Scott Seville, who plays with a band in North Carolina,
was onstage singing a torrid version of Grand Funk Railroad's "We're
an American Band," accompanied on guitar by Mark Farner, who
congratulated him with a high-five.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Terry Dobson of Vero Beach, Fla., climbed onstage with his
video camera during a grinding rendition of ZZ Top's "La Grange" to
sing a verse. Bassist Blades slid over and took the camera from
Dobson, then handed it to bandleader Rivera, who shot a couple
seconds of Dobson, then turned the camera toward the audience of
campers, gesturing for them to applaud wildly as Dobson kept singing.</TE>
<TE>   This being a fantasy camp, they did exactly that.</TE>

<DH>"The Air Show at Brescia, 1909" By Peter Demetz; Farrar,
Straus and Giroux:  254 pages, $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carmela Ciuraru</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the preface to his latest book, "The Air Show at Brescia, 1909,"
author Peter Demetz states matter-of-factly, "I think of the present
volume as an 'entertainment,' to borrow Graham Greene's term, not as
a scholarly monograph, which I gladly leave to somebody else."</LD>
<LD>   Undoubtedly Demetz -- professor emeritus of German and comparative
literature at Yale University -- could have produced that scholarly
text himself. But instead he has written a quirky, fascinating book
about a somewhat obscure historical event. His account is copiously
researched and immensely entertaining.</LD>
<LD>   In the fall of 1909, an airfield was built in the northern Italian
city of Brescia, and the world's leading aviators were invited to
compete at a time when the spectacle of flight was something that
many had never before witnessed. As interesting as the show itself
was, Demetz pays just as much attention to some of the more notable
attendees of the event -- among them, the flamboyant Italian poet
Gabriele d'Annunzio; the composer Giacomo Puccini; and especially a
26-year-old lawyer named Franz Kafka, who also happened to be a
writer.</LD>
<TE>   Kafka showed up at the Brescia air show ("Il Circuito Aereo di
Brescia") with a few friends, including fellow writer Max Brod. The
young men were among the thousands of others who showed up for the
event, characterized by Demetz as "a unique encounter of resourceful
engineers, daring pilots, visionaries from the provinces, and eminent
artists and writers." While Brod had already established himself as a
writer, his friend Kafka had not, and Brod hoped that attending the
air show might break Kafka's writer's block. It did. The two men
planned to publish newspaper articles about the experience, and threw
themselves into covering it. Demetz recounts the two roving
reporters' sharp but odd observations of the scene around them:
Kafka, unimpressed by opera, described Puccini as having "the nose of
an alcoholic."</TE>
<TE>   Kafka's article appeared in a Prague newspaper on Sept. 29, 1909,
having been trimmed quite a bit by his editor. Demetz analyzes (and
quotes at length from) this remarkable piece of journalism for the
virtues Kafka would later display in his fiction. Kafka's style of
reportage, which "moves between the exigencies of the newspaper genre
and his own nascent habits of writing," was full of his "personal
attitudes, his special imagery, [and] his almost obsessive interest
in physiognomy and gesture."</TE>
<TE>   Although Kafka is a central figure in this story, it also offers a
wealth of other details, including a play-by-play description of the
dramatic air show and the politics involved in making it happen. The
Brescia event was clearly a matter of national pride, intended to
upstage France, which had already held its own air show.</TE>
<TE>   This was Italy's first, with a total of 12 competitors in
altitude, speed and "the best time in flying one or two passengers
for a distance of at least nine kilometers." Competitors included
Italians and Frenchmen, and one American aviator, Glenn Curtiss, who
ended up winning the grand prize and was celebrated as being "the
fastest man on earth, or rather in the sky" and who the Italians
thought of as "a kind of reticent, gangly Gary Cooper who went aloft
in an ill-fitting suit." Demetz doesn't disappoint in taking a series
of anecdotes, reports and strange facts (in his words, "a productive
chaos of details") and forming them into a comprehensive view of a
defining moment in modern aviation. Although Demetz occasionally gets
bogged down in minor details, those detours do not detract from the
book's more engaging passages.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the author describes the intense international
coverage of the show, with more than 60 publications from around the
world represented. Interestingly, although this event occurred nearly
100 years ago, the news media apparently hasn't changed much. Demetz
writes about the packs of eager reporters at Brescia, chasing after
the famous people in attendance.</TE>
<TE>   "The Air Show at Brescia" is surely valuable for its portrait of
Kafka as a young man, chronicling his travels, writings and
interests. Yet this is also a great story about aviation, told in a
way that goes beyond an audience of avid flight buffs. Demetz conveys
well the excitement stirred by air travel, and how meaningful the
experience was to its bold pioneers. He also explores some of the
troubling implications posed by aviation technology: As society
yearned to travel farther and faster, where would this new technology
take us?</TE>
<TE>   The prescient young Kafka noted that flight instilled men with a
giddy sense of their own power: "Watching planes ascending and
landing for the first time in his life," Demetz writes, "Franz Kafka
had dim forebodings about humanity becoming too mobile and possibly
alienating itself from its traditional homes and beliefs." Or, as
Demetz concludes, the air show "may have been the last luminous
moment of a strange innocence, something rare that should not be
forgotten."</TE>

<LD>Competition for the foreign-language film Oscar is already coming
from filmmakers on distant shores.</LD>
<LD>   Spain has entered Fernando Leon's "Los Lunes al Sol" ("Mondays in
the Sun"), a drama about unemployed dockyard workers. It stars Javier
Bardem, who was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance as
writer Reinaldo Arenas in "Before Night Falls" (2000).</LD>
<LD>   Italy has submitted Roberto Benigni's "Pinocchio," the live-action
version of the fairy tale. Benigni, who stars as the wooden puppet,
won an Academy Award for best actor in 1997 for "La Vita e Bella"
("Life Is Beautiful"). The movie, which Benigni co-wrote, also won
best foreign language film.</LD>
<TE>   Films submitted previously include Mexico's "El Crimen del Padre
Amaro" ("The Crime of Father Amaro"), Russia's "House of Fools" and
Belgium's "Le Fils" ("The Son").</TE>
<TE>   Deadline for submission was Nov. 1, and the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences plans to release a list of all the
foreign-language submissions later this month.</TE>

<HD>Emotional film journey in Korea</HD>
<DH>The low-budget 'The Way Home' has been a sentimental
blockbuster at home, tapping into guilt over the treatment of elders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Chute</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hard-boiled moviegoers who go out of their way to avoid even the
appearance of sentimentality may have a hard time sorting out their
reactions to the Korean import, "The Way Home," which opens Friday in
Los Angeles. Is it an art movie or a commercial tear-jerker or some
kind of crafty hybrid that uses a deceptively simple and direct
narrative style to sneak past our emotional defenses?</LD>
<LD>   The film's slow-building emotional power was confirmed earlier
this year, when the carefully crafted low-budget drama became an
unexpected summer blockbuster in Korea, beating out glossy imports
from Hollywood and Hong Kong and reducing moviegoers of all ages to
puddles of helpless tears.</LD>
<LD>   Much of that emotion came to be focused upon the 77-year-old woman
who plays the grandmother, an actual rural villager named Kim
Eul-boon. Discovered during a location scout in her remote mountain
village, Kim became an overnight celebrity.</LD>
<TE>   "She didn't believe it at first," says the film's writer-director,
Lee Jung-hyang, "because not only had she never acted in a film
before, she had not even seen one. And now there were people driving
200 miles from Seoul to this remote village just to see her face,
whole families walking up the mountain. A lot of them just hold her
hand and cry, because they are reminiscing about their own
grandmothers."</TE>
<TE>   And now "The Way Home" seems poised to put U.S. audiences through
the same emotional ringer, capping its success at film festivals in
San Sebastian, Spain, and Toronto by becoming the first Korean
feature film to be distributed in the U.S. by a major studio,
Paramount Classics, the studio's art house division.</TE>
<TE>   Lee acknowledges that the character of Granny Kim was based in
part on her own maternal grandmother. "While neither the actress or
my real grandmother was mute [Granny Kim is in the film], they both
could not read or write. I wanted to suggest a contrast in the film
between nature and civilization, but not overtly or out loud. With
the concept that the grandmother is a part of nature, it made sense
to me that she could not talk, as nature does not directly speak to
us. We have to learn how to interpret what it is telling us."</TE>
<TE>   In Korea, the film seems to have tapped into the lingering guilt
feelings of many younger viewers over how they have treated (or
mistreated) their elders. This is a theme that seems to have a
special resonance in traditional Asian societies, where until fairly
recently unbroken families often stayed together after the marriage
of the eldest son, and the grandparents still had a useful role to
play in the household.</TE>
<TE>   "The concept of the nuclear family is new in Korea," says Lee, who
was herself raised in an extended family. Her own "Granny Kim" left
her village upon the death of her husband, shortly before Lee's birth
in 1964, and lived with the family until her own death two years ago.
The 38-year-old director currently shares her childhood home with her
parents. "But even in my own family," she says, "if I were to declare
independence and move out, I don't think that my parents would go to
live with my older brother, who is their only son. They would go on
living in their apartment, until one of them passed away.</TE>
<TE>   "In the countryside this trend is even more obvious. In Korean
culture the village is our hometown, and we still have a lot of
nostalgia for that. Even for people who were born and raised in the
city, this is the image of home in their heart. But that doesn't mean
that we can go back and live there. The young people don't want to
live in a village anymore. They move far away to the city to be
modern as soon as they can."</TE>
<TE>   A landmark movie</TE>
<TE>   The almost painful timeliness of its theme may help to explain why
"The Way Home" has been acclaimed as a landmark movie in Korea,
signaling a new phase in the development of the nation's rapidly
expanding film industry. Since the mid-1990s, and on the heels of a
prolonged decline, Korean cinema has rebounded to become a box office
powerhouse in east Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Most accounts trace the beginnings of the so-called "Korean cinema
renaissance" back to 1992, when in the name of free trade the
government relaxed import restrictions on foreign movies. Local
filmmakers were forced to compete head-on with popular offerings from
Hollywood and Hong Kong, and in the mid-'90s a new generation of
directors, often film-school trained, rose to the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, when the glossy spy thriller "Shiri" became a
blockbuster hit, Korean films have been out-grossing the imports on a
regular basis. In 2001, the top five attractions at the Korean box
office were all home-grown productions.</TE>
<TE>   When Korean audiences began embracing local films, the moviemakers
responded to their enthusiasm and worked harder to meet their
expectations, and the quality of the movies kept getting better.</TE>
<TE>   Noted Lee: "As producers have become more confident, the genres of
films that can get financing have become more diverse, and more
opportunities are being given to young people and to female
directors. Personally, I feel I was very lucky to be able to make my
first two films while this phenomenon was happening."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the films in the first wave of Korean blockbusters were
blandly international in flavor. Increasingly, though, younger
directors seem to be edging back toward an approach advocated by the
veteran Korean master Im Kwon-taek ("Chongyang"), who is hard at work
in his 70s on a series of films depicting traditional Korean art
forms -- films (as he says) "that only a Korean could make." Lee
Jung-hyang's first feature, "Art Museum by the Zoo" (1999), took a
tentative step in this direction, offering a satirical, reflexive
twist on a genre that was becoming hackneyed in local cinema: the
"quirky" romantic comedy set among Westernized yuppies.</TE>
<TE>   A 1988 graduate of the Korean Film Academy, Lee drew partly on her
own experience when creating the central female character in "Art
Museum," an aspiring screenwriter who is thrown together with a
crabby young soldier who has been dumped by his chic fiancee.</TE>
<TE>   According to Lee, her two films tell strikingly similar stories,
about "people who meet and because of their prejudice or
personalities don't like each other at first, and then grow to
understand each other." But she admits that after the unexpected
commercial success of "Art Museum," "some people were very surprised
when they heard the story of 'The Way Home.' At that point I could
have gotten any top stars and a big budget. In fact I had many
offers. So here I am with nonprofessional actors way out in the
country. But once they saw the movie, and could see why I wanted to
tell this story, then they understood."</TE>
<TE>   City-bred crew</TE>
<TE>   With her short-cropped hair and her L.L. Bean-in-Seoul outfit of
Oxford cloth shirt and jeans, Lee could blend right in with the
sophisticated urbanites of "Art Museum." And she admits that for the
youthful city-bred crew of "The Way Home," the six-month shoot in the
central Korean province of Chungcheongbuk-do, "cut off from the news
and friends and entertainment," was often a trial.</TE>
<TE>   "Before we began production, the producer and myself made a
promise to each other not to change the lives of the people there,
and not to offend their feelings. We followed this even with the
actors. When I was directing Granny Kim, I would say, 'If this and
this were to happen, how would you feel?' Instead of making her copy
me, I let her come up with the behavior."</TE>

<HD>'Yo, dog': Positively Shakespearean rap</HD>

<LD>As always, we are sitting in front of eight goons eating popcorn,
eight guys fresh out of prison or some other form of managed-care
living, who repeat all the dialogue they hear up on the movie screen.
Take away the S-word and they couldn't even speak.</LD>
<LD>   "Yo, dog," says Eminem.</LD>
<LD>   "Yo, dog," say Eminem's friends.</LD>
<TE>   "Yo, dog," say the guys behind us.</TE>
<TE>   They gag on their popcorn and cough into the back of our heads.
Might be a long night here at the multiplex.</TE>
<TE>   "Yo, dog," they say again up on the screen.</TE>
<TE>   We are here to see "8 Mile," out to assess the ever-richer
cultural landscape and figure out why America has fallen for Eminem,
this tattooed Cinderella from Detroit. The one who spouts the
sometimes vile lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   The one everybody under 25 suddenly adores. And, surprisingly,
some older critics as well.</TE>
<TE>   Time magazine gushes: "Beneath its tough -- no, filthy -- talk and
rough look, it is a fairy tale that -- and this ought to be enough
irony for the sniffiest Postmodernist -- the unlikely career of its
leading man proves can come true."</TE>
<TE>   And the Los Angeles Times says: "Like Shakespeare's Prince Hal,
[Eminem] is royalty in mufti, wrestling with inner demons before
feeling the confidence to declare himself the heir apparent, if not
the king."</TE>
<TE>   Shakespeare, huh? No wonder the movie took in $51.2 million its
first weekend. No wonder the young gentlemen in the row behind us are
so excited.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, they've turned out across America, all the teenagers in their
mothers' Mustangs and their fathers' BMWs. Dr. Pepper coursing
through their veins. Popcorn in their teeth and gums. Awaiting this
Postmodernist's delight.</TE>
<TE>   "That's Eminem," my son says when the movie finally starts.</TE>
<TE>   "Him?" I ask, wondering what the big deal is.</TE>
<TE>   Up on the screen, Eminem plays Jimmy Smith Jr., a shy rapper also
known as "Bunny Rabbit."</TE>
<TE>   "My friends think you're crazy," says a girl with a bad dye job.</TE>
<TE>   "Yo, your friends don't even know me," Bunny Rabbit patiently
explains.</TE>
<TE>   Evidently, here's what's bad about Bunny Rabbit's life: He's
living in a trailer with his white-trash mother. He works in a
factory. He has no car, because he gave it to a girlfriend who says
she's pregnant. Not without a heart, this guy.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what's good about his life: He is a raw but promising
rapper. Everyone wants to help him make it big. He has a new
girlfriend with "come get me" eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi," he says back.</TE>
<TE>   They flip each other the finger. Love: It's a little different
these days.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, no one in the film is over 30, except for the
white-trash mother played by Kim Basinger, who still looks more like
a Newport Beach divorcee after a rough day shopping.</TE>
<TE>   One visit to a tanning salon and she could have any rich man in
Michigan. Unfortunately, no one in the movie takes the time to
explain that.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Thursday," she says. "I gotta go to bingo."</TE>
<TE>   In Detroit, they live every moment.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, her son Bunny Rabbit is hanging out with his buddies
along 8 Mile, a bleak street that represents the DMZ or the Yellow
Brick Road, depending on which movie critic you talk to.</TE>
<TE>   "I gotta save up some money and get the hell out of here," Bunny
Rabbit says.</TE>
<TE>   "Yo, dog," says one of his friends.</TE>
<TE>   "Yo, dog," says another.</TE>
<TE>   Take away all the "Yo, dogs," and this movie would be about 20
seconds long.</TE>
<TE>   But they are the best part of the movie, these buddy scenes. In no
time, you find yourself watching a strangely charming little film
about a bunch of guys struggling to get out of the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   As if that weren't enough, there's the "Rocky" ending, pitting two
rappers against each other in a rap-off. Not the Lincoln-Douglas
debate exactly. But oddly fascinating, nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   "I know somethin' 'bout you," Bunny wails. "You went to Cranbrook
and that's A PRIVATE SCHOOL!!!"</TE>
<TE>   Ouch.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, Bunny Rabbit scores a knockout with that one. No rapper
could ever overcome accusations of a private school education.</TE>
<TE>   And before our eyes, a star is born.</TE>
<TE>   He looks out from the stage and sees the girlfriend, the one he
loved, then lost. She smiles. He smiles. They give each other the
finger.</TE>
<TE>   Love. It's a little different these days.</TE>

<HD>McPartland displays an ageless agility</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All the plastic surgery, make-up and careful lighting in the world
can't persuade a motion picture camera to reproduce aging actors in
the images of their youth. But it's different for musicians, whose
image -- via their music -- can remain timeless.</LD>
<LD>   Pianist Marian McPartland is a prime example. On Monday night at
the Jazz Bakery, the veteran jazz artist, who will celebrate her 85th
birthday in March, offered a program as vibrant and alive as anything
she's done over the course of her nearly seven-decade career.</LD>
<LD>   Elegantly garbed in a sparkling evening jacket and black pants,
McPartland was a small but spry figure, fully in command of the
stage, wittily introducing each of her numbers. Her hands -- despite
her sardonic reference to arthritis -- moved with smooth precision
across the keyboard, easily shifting from rhapsodic arpeggios to
brightly swinging bebop lines. In every piece, her soloing was
enriched by a sophisticated sense of chordal harmony, bringing
unexpected musical density to even the most familiar melodies.</LD>
<TE>   McPartland has become well known as the result of her National
Public Radio "Piano Jazz" program, now heading toward its 25th
anniversary. But she was a well-established jazz artist long before
the show's kickoff in 1978. Always a versatile player, she has become
even more eclectic in recent years, perhaps as a result of her
encounters with the many diverse musical stylists who have been
guests on her show.</TE>
<TE>   Her Bakery program, for example, included standards such as "Sweet
Lorraine" and "All the Things You Are" -- the latter performed with
an arranged segment in which the theme was delivered in Baroque
contrapuntal style. But she also offered Duke Ellington's rarely
heard "Warm Valley," Billy Strayhorn's jauntily swinging "Rain Check"
and, even more surprisingly, Ornette Coleman's rhythmically quirky
"Ramblin'."</TE>
<TE>   As a closer, McPartland asked for requests from the audience and,
receiving a few, combined three standards -- "Laura," "Emily" and
"Green Dolphin Street" -- into a seamlessly integrated medley.</TE>
<TE>   McPartland's performance, delivered before an overflow crowd (and
repeated on Tuesday), was enhanced by the steady presence of bassist
Bill Douglass and drummer Scott Davis. But the unquestioned star of
the evening was the ever-youthful jazz of a remarkable octogenarian.</TE>

<HD>Storehouse on the plains: bison</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Did you know that as many as 65 million bison once roamed the
grasslands of the Great Plains? They were commonly known as buffalo,
from the Italian word bufalo, meaning large, wild ox.</LD>
<LD>   The American Indians living on or around the Great Plains hunted
bison and used almost every part of the large animal for tools,
clothing, games or toys and, of course, food. The bison was so
important to the people that it became part of their religion and
culture.</LD>
<LD>   The bison was like a "mall on hoofs." It was a supermarket,
clothing store, shoe store, home, furniture store and hardware store,
all in one animal. In giving its life, the bison gave life to the
people.</LD>
<TE>   The Indians ate roasted bison meat or dried it to make jerky.
Tanned hides were used for robes, moccasins or tepee covers. The
animals' bones could be sharpened for knives or arrowheads, while
flatter ones were shaped to make hoes and shovels. Hoofs could be
boiled to make a glue that bound arrowheads to their shafts.</TE>
<TE>   Two rib bones were used as runners for winter sleds. Horns were
cut and steamed to shape bowls, cups, ladles and spoons. And the
strong sinew or tendon was used to string a bow or to sew hides
together.</TE>
<TE>   You can learn more about the bison and see many things made and
used by the American Indians at the Southwest Museum. For more
information, call (323) 221-2164 or visit www.southwestmuseum.org.</TE>

<HD>Secrets, lies and cover-ups</HD>
<DH>Americans have a continuing fascination with conspiracy
theories. A new thriller turns on the 'unsolved, confounding mystery'
of JFK's assassination.</DH>

<LD>Ten years ago, writer-director Neil Burger was a fledgling filmmaker
making a documentary in Texas about World War II vets. One evening,
he was having dinner alone at a bar and grill when "sort of an odd
old guy" started up a conversation with him. Their chat was the seed
for Burger's documentary-style thriller, "Interview With the
Assassin," which opens Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "He asked me what I was doing and I told him," Burger recalls.
"For some reason, he thought I was a reporter and he told me he had a
story that was going to blow the lid off of everything. He was very
evasive. He wouldn't tell me. He wouldn't look at me. He would talk
about something and then he would come back to it. Eventually, I got
out of him that he knew somebody who was involved in the Kennedy
assassination, which is a pretty incredible thing to hear."</LD>
<LD>   On the one hand, says Burger, he didn't believe the man. So he
pressed him for more details. "I got next to nothing out of him.
Eventually he stood up and I thought he was just going to the
bathroom, but he never came back. Later the next day, I was on a
plane out of there. I thought he was pulling the leg of some young
kid. But on the other hand, as with anything dealing with this event,
there is a shred of possibility that he was for real. He always stuck
with me and haunted me in a way."</LD>
<TE>   Since the assassination of John F. Kennedy 39 years ago,
filmmakers like Burger have been drawn to the questions surrounding
the president's murder in Dallas and the various conspiracy theories
surrounding the event. Kennedy's death has lead to a seemingly
never-ending stream of movies dealing with conspiracies, whether it
be about political assassinations -- "Executive Action," "The
Parallax View," "JFK" -- government-covering-up-aliens-invasion --
"The X-Files" -- or law enforcement corruption -- "Copland," "L.A.
Confidential."</TE>
<TE>   Though Burger isn't a conspiracy junkie, he has always been
interested in the theories surrounding the Kennedy assassination. "It
is this unsolved, confounding mystery of American history," he
explains. "I think for myself and a lot of other people, you delve
into it because you can't believe that this public event has so many
unanswered questions. What can drive you mad is that there isn't any
definitive conclusive evidence on anything. You follow these trails
of evidence down the line. They are so tantalizing, but you never
have the answer. It is enough to keep you going, looking for more. It
is enough to drive you insane."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond Kennedy</TE>
<TE>   In the case of "Interview With the Assassin," Burger looks at the
Kennedy assassination through the eyes of an out-of-work TV news
cameraman who believes he's fallen into the story of a lifetime. An
old, enigmatic neighbor has asked the gullible cameraman to come over
to his house with his camera because he has a secret he's finally
willing to reveal -- he was the "grassy knoll gunman" -- the second
assassin of JFK. But is he telling the truth?</TE>
<TE>   "The heart of the movie is beyond the Kennedy thing," Burger says.
"It is really about these two men and the power play between them and
how they are both trying to matter in the world and feel somehow
significant in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Before the Kennedy assassination, there were movies dealing with
conspiracies, most notably John Frankenheimer's chilling 1962 film,
"The Manchurian Candidate." And in 1954, Frank Sinatra gave one of
his best performances as a paid killer hired to assassinate the
president in "Suddenly." Of course, during World War II there were
plenty of films dealing with Nazi conspiracies in the U.S., such as
"Fallen Sparrow" in 1943.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't until Dallas that Americans began to mistrust the
government. "There were conspiracies before that time, but it was
only with the Kennedy assassination that the American people began to
believe that the government was capable of a conspiracy," says film
historian Jan-Christopher Horak, curator of the Hollywood
Entertainment Museum.</TE>
<TE>   "There have always been conspiracies of outsiders trying to
overthrow the government or this or that and occasional films like
'Manchurian Candidate' where rogue military people [were plotting],
but you have the double whammy of the Kennedy assassination and the
seeming cover-up of a conspiracy."</TE>
<TE>   The Watergate break-in in 1972, says Horak, just added fuel to the
conspiracy fire. "Watergate is really important as a seminal moment
when the American public finally understood that the people in
government were capable of forming conspiracies."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until after Watergate that Hollywood began to take up
the conspiracy-theory movie banner with such films as "Executive
Action," "The Parallax View," "Chinatown," "All The President's Men,"
"Three Days of the Condor," "The China Syndrome," "Blow Out" and "The
Star Chamber."</TE>
<TE>   Horak also views the continued fascination with conspiracy movies
as an aspect of the tabloid press' influence on the mainstream media.
"It used to be a time when people would differentiate between the
National Enquirer and the L.A. Times," he says. "Nowadays, it seems
clear to me that this differentiation no longer really exists.
Mainstream, especially broadcast news, will pick up stories from the
tabloid press and report them in quite the same fashion as legitimate
stories.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it really has to do with the fact that everything is
grist for the media's mill these days. If it is real or imagined
doesn't often make a lot of difference. The Roswell-alien syndrome
which has really taken off and is so embedded in our popular culture
that is almost accepted as real."</TE>

<LD>Winona Ryder didn't take the stand during her recent shoplifting
trial, but we might see Sandra Bullock testifying in court in Austin,
Texas, come January.</LD>
<LD>   She started a new Lake Austin house back in 1998 and became
involved in a deal to profit from other development with its builder,
Benny Daneshjou. Now, the house stands unfinished and unoccupied, and
Bullock says every part of it needs doing over.</LD>
<LD>   Bullock claims she has spent $6.5 million for a $1.5-million
house. Daneshjou claims the popular actress has defamed him and is
out to ruin him. There is even a criminal investigation into this
matter.</LD>
<TE>   State District Judge Jeanne Meurer says she is fed up with not
getting anywhere in this matter and, according to a published report,
will hear both sides in January.</TE>
<TE>   And speaking of Winona, the British press is very much on her
side, along with important people in Hollywood. They say, "She didn't
do a hit and run, for Pete's sake. She didn't kill anybody. Get off
of it, and let Winona be Winona."</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to take the Los Angeles court system seriously,
ever since O.J. Simpson was acquitted.</TE>

<LD>The election is over (the outcome was never really in doubt), and
everyone is hoping to get back to business as usual.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, I'm talking about "The West Wing."</LD>
<LD>   America's fictional president, Jed Bartlet, easily won reelection
last Wednesday, after trouncing a language-mangling southern governor
in a debate the week before. To some, the parallels between Bartlet's
opponent and the White House's current occupant were representative
of a liberal bent that has turned off conservative viewers.</LD>
<TE>   Talk radio host Larry Elder, for one, has insisted the program's
20%-plus ratings stumble versus the corresponding stretch last fall
is directly attributable to its out-of-step politics, and he found
plenty of callers to echo that position.</TE>
<TE>   A less subjective analysis suggests the decline is more complex,
with competitive factors explaining much of the audience attrition.
Faring best as it does among older and more affluent viewers, "The
West Wing" has always been vulnerable to titillating concepts that
lure away the younger crowd -- from Fox's "Temptation Island" and
"Celebrity Boxing" to the show's current nemesis, ABC's "The
Bachelor."</TE>
<TE>   To test my own theory, when I broached the subject of watching
"The Bachelor" to a class at USC last week, nearly every female hand
shot up. (Yes, parents, this is what your tuition is paying for.)</TE>
<TE>   Still, given last week's disparate election results real and
imagined, the question of how politics affect "The West Wing" merits
consideration. The world and mood of the country, after all, have
changed considerably since the series premiered in 1999, when Bartlet
and his team provided an idealized wish-fulfillment version of the
then-administration.</TE>
<TE>   The hard evidence, such as it is, lends qualified support to the
notion politics has been at least a contributing factor to the show's
sluggish performance.</TE>
<TE>   According to demographic data from Simmons Market Research Bureau,
people who identify themselves as "very conservative" have always
been less likely to watch the show, but the gap grew during the most
recent survey period from May 2001 to May 2002. "West Wing" viewers
were more likely to identify themselves as "somewhat conservative"
than the average viewer, as did those in the "somewhat liberal" or
"very liberal" categories.</TE>
<TE>   Breakdowns for the Los Angeles area from Scarborough Research,
meanwhile, actually found self-identified Republicans to be slightly
more likely than Democrats to watch the series, with only
independents placing below average.</TE>
<TE>   This shouldn't be a complete surprise. "West Wing" viewers tend to
be older and richer -- attributes generally associated with
Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   As one research analyst put it, people might listen to Rush
Limbaugh because they like his politics, but in prime time, most
folks simply want to be entertained.</TE>
<TE>   In that respect, it's easy to see how lecturing the audience might
be off-putting, something series creator Aaron Sorkin has seemingly
done with greater frequency since the 2000 election controversy and
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Many critics derided the hastily assembled Middle East civics
lesson that kicked off last season for being preachy. Similarly, some
have said that Sorkin wrote himself into a corner with the election
story arc, which almost required being heavier on ideology and
lighter on suspense.</TE>
<TE>   Had Bartlet lost, after all, the series would have become "West
Wing 2: The GOP Years."</TE>
<TE>   Yet with the show amassing record ratings a year ago and its
creator heralded as a genius, who around him could say no? Such
naysaying has thus been left to Web sites like www.tele
visionwithoutpity.com, where some posters labeled the debate
anti-climactic and the show more one-sided since losing its most
fleshed-out conservative voice, Ainsley Hayes, with Emily Procter,
who plays her, relocating to "CSI: Miami."</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Birkett, a Beaverton, Canada, writer who provides the
site's detailed recaps of each episode, called the Republican
contender "a straw man" for Bartlet to steamroll. "Why they paid
James Brolin when they could have just cast a scarecrow I have no
idea," she noted, adding in regard to Sorkin, "I keep hoping he'll
get back on his game."</TE>
<TE>   Sorkin declined to be interviewed. Talking to Newsweek, however,
he suggested that press coverage of the show's diminished ratings was
somehow tied to upcoming contract renewal negotiations with NBC -- a
conspiratorial mind-set better suited to "The X-Files" than "The West
Wing."</TE>
<TE>   To keep this in perspective, "The West Wing" remains a success by
virtually any measure, averaging 16.2 million viewers this season,
11th among prime-time programs. The renewal fee might drop from what
its studio, Warner Bros., would have commanded a year ago, but no one
needs to hold bake sales for the profit participants.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Lowe, in what was apparently a snit over money, is leaving.
New characters will come on board. Life goes on.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it seems equally true that "The West Wing" peaked last year
and will be hard-pressed -- for various reasons, not least among them
the TV world's preoccupation with the new and different -- to reverse
its current parabolic course. The series will still be popular and
prestigious, to be sure, but hardly the sensation it was.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever Sorkin may infer, this is also noteworthy. Not only is
the program a three-time Emmy winner as best drama, but for many it
provides a more enticing window into the world of politics than any
hour spent watching CNN or Fox News Channel ever could.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the lines between news and entertainment, fact and
fiction, keep blurring. Episodic dramas rip stories from the
headlines, right next to newsmagazines that behave like dramas. This
dynamic helped fuel interest in "The West Wing," but it has also kept
a spotlight trained on its foibles and shortcomings. Such is life
inside the fishbowl.</TE>
<TE>   President Bartlet delivered a monologue during the debate that
could easily be the show's own disclaimer to critics: "I'm the
president of the United States, not the president of the people who
agree with me. And by the way, if the left has a problem with that,
they should vote for somebody else."</TE>
<TE>   Based on the ratings, some are using their remotes to do just
that. And whether it's because of their affinity for "The Bachelor"
or George W. Bush, it seems pretty clear that the honeymoon is over.</TE>

<HD>Survival of the richest</HD>
<DH>A guide offers a quasi-scientific analysis of how the
wealthy behave like beasts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary McNamara</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If he isn't careful, Richard Conniff will become the next A-list
party must-have, invited in the hopes that he will display his
"gift," like a spoon-bending psychic. Since the publication of his
new book, "The Natural History of the Rich: A Field Guide," a
quasi-scientific analysis of the personality traits of the very rich,
people have been asking him to do the most extraordinary things.</LD>
<LD>   One took him to lunch at Four Seasons in New York and asked him to
deconstruct the posture of nearby diner Ron Perelman; another
wondered if he would provide an analytical commentary for a fashion
spread -- what do certain clothes say about the ladder rung of the
wearer.</LD>
<LD>   "What I don't understand," says Conniff, "is when rich people want
to talk to me about rich people. About themselves, about their
friends. They want to know what it all means, what their behavior
means."</LD>
<TE>   Personal primate-behavior consultant -- really, darling, you must
get one.</TE>
<TE>   The premise of Conniff's book is that the rich are different from
you and me. That the rich ($5 mil or more) form a cultural
subspecies, different from the rest of humankind. And within that
subcategory, their actions and affectations are as explainable, and
predictable, as any group of baboons.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Conniff has been both science writer, following
Amazonian expeditions and baboon exploits in Botswana for Smithsonian
and National Geographic, and style scribe for Architectural Digest.
The book is chockfull of dope on the mating habits of the mayfly and
the gender bending of stickleback fish. But mostly, it shows that
traits of alpha males, and females, are pretty much the same if the
animal in question is a squirrel monkey or Ted Turner.</TE>
<TE>   With chapter titles like "Take this Gift, Dammit!: Dominance the
Nice Way," the book, for all its references to field studies and
footnotes, is a fun read. And, as he makes very clear in his
introduction, Conniff believes that the cross-species parallels he
draws -- from grooming patterns (alphas get better hair care whether
monkey or man) to family structures (power is maintained by producing
few legitimate offspring) -- are genuine but limited.</TE>
<TE>   People, even rich people, do not have an enormous amount in common
with dance flies -- just the tendency to present a so-so gift in
fabulous wrapping. "Males are supposed to present their mates with
luscious bugs that they wrap in silk," says Conniff of the flies.
"But some suck the juice out first, and some find really old bugs and
some just wrap up air. I call this the natural history of the Tiffany
box."</TE>
<TE>   Although not in the book, the anecdote captures the book's tone.
"My intent," he writes in the book's introduction, "is to use the
tool of evolutionary psychology with gleeful caution ... to provoke
and entertain."</TE>
<TE>   'Comfortable,' not rich</TE>
<TE>   And perhaps to reassure the hoi polloi that different isn't always
better even if it comes with six zeros attached. The rich according
to Conniff are isolated, competitive, often quite unhappy and almost
always self-deluded. In fact, he says, the first sign that a person
is really rich is when he or she denies this. "Even if they're
billionaires, they're never rich," he said. "They're always
'comfortable.' "</TE>
<TE>   He is sitting with his back to the rolling lawn of the
Ritz-Carlton Huntington in Pasadena. The afternoon is fading into
cool shade; there are few people out on the terrace and no one is
asking him to explain this woman's walk or that man's glance, which
is OK with him; he spent five years wealth-watching for the book, and
two years more convincing himself he really had something to say
about it.</TE>
<TE>   He also knows that the popularity of the book has as much to do
with the subject as his particular take on it. If the poor are always
with us, so inevitably are the rich, and they have much better
luggage. They do things like cover barstools with leather made of
whale scrotum (Aristotle Onassis) and cut off each other's yachts
while vacationing in Capri (Larry Ellison and Paul Allen). The super
rich fill magazine and newspaper pages, fuel a trickle-down economy
and simultaneously spark envy and disdain among the middle class.</TE>
<TE>   "We are always looking up the social ladder," Conniff said. "That
is what primates do. We look to the alphas because they will give
things to us -- protection, food, other goodies -- and in this
society, the alphas are rich people. These people control our lives,
decide if we're going to have a job."</TE>
<TE>   Tall and solid, with a professorial beard and tweed jacket,
Conniff looks a bit like what he is -- a Connecticut-based writer.
His previous books include "Spineless Wonders: Tales From the
Invertebrate World" and "Every Creeping Thing: True Tales of Faintly
Repulsive Wildlife," so he's used to traveling amid frightening
fauna. Still, he says, there's no place that beats L.A. in
fear-factor terms. "Hollywood is the most nakedly vicious group of
rich people I have ever seen," he said. He is, perhaps, still
stinging from the time when, during the course of his research, he
tried to fake being rich in L.A. He rented a bright red Ferrari F355
Spider convertible and was shocked to find that no one was fooled --
no one deferred to him. "Maybe I had a blinking neon sign on my
forehead that said 'not Nouveau Riche, but Rental.' "</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. is like the Serengeti," he said. "You can sit and watch the
wildebeests running by and the lions just sitting there picking them
off. It's quite amazing. New York, on the other hand, is like the
rain forest -- they're probably doing the exact same sort of thing,
but they're doing it way high up in the canopy where no one can see
them."</TE>
<TE>   For the purposes of his book, Conniff did not include many
celebrities or politicians in his survey group -- although there is
quite a bit about the Churchills and European nobility in general --
because he wanted to examine cases in which money was the pure
motivator and magnet.</TE>
<TE>   'This town is more vicious'</TE>
<TE>   "More interesting to me than celebrity money are the producers or
the screenwriters, the short, fat guys who didn't make the basketball
team or get crowned prom king," he said. "I think that's why the
style in this town is more vicious. I have heard story after story of
personal assistants constantly humiliated by the boss. It seems
they're just making up for years of rejection. And perpetrating a
cycle of abuse -- they had to put up with it, and now you do too."</TE>
<TE>   "There is no model for ritual humiliation in the animal world that
I know of," he added. "Animals tend to simply dispatch the loser,
either by killing him or banishing him."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Conniff has seen many scenarios similar to the
industry's hand-washing attitude toward Robert Blake now that he's in
jail. It reminds him of a baboon field study that included a lone
male baboon who had fallen from grace. "It's really amazing," he
said. "An alpha male will have subordinates grooming him 10 times a
day. This guy, no one would touch. He was completely on his own."</TE>
<TE>   Joy from celebrity woes</TE>
<TE>   Celebrities, he says, are different from other rich people
because, for the most part, they don't get wealthy in an "aggressive,
Bill Gates, alpha-male sort of way. So they're easier to identify
with." The flip side of that familiarity is society's endless need to
see the celebrated brought down a few pegs. And lately, that gotcha
attitude has extended out of Hollywood to the executive class.
Conniff was amazed at how the crowd roared during the weeks of
executive perp walks earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of it is schadenfreude, I suppose," he said. "We always love
to see the mighty brought low. And with someone like Jack Welch or
Dennis Kozlowski, I suppose, it's [a case of] when they're up, and
making us money, offering us protection, we're more tolerant. When
they're down, we want revenge." Because, of course, they took a lot
of people down with them.</TE>
<TE>   During his two-day stay in L.A., Conniff learned a little of the
local posturing first-hand. He got a call from an industry
heavyweight who was interested in his book and wanted to meet him. In
telling this to a reporter, he mentioned the producer's name, then
said he should probably check and see if it was OK to print that name
here. He called back to say he had talked to the producer's assistant
and it was not OK to use his name. Even though it had been a very
nice meeting, even though no damage could be done by printing the
name. It was a simple flexing of power.</TE>
<TE>   Did Conniff recognize the irony that despite all his insight into
the trappings of dominance, he was playing right along?</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely," he said, laughing loudly. "Are you kidding? I'm a
freelance writer. If I need to grovel, I grovel. I'm not kidding
myself."</TE>
<TE>   Would Conniff like to be rich then, knowing all that he knows now,
of the isolation and self-delusion?</TE>
<TE>   "No," he said, after a moment. "I'd like to say I would be
different if I were rich, but I wouldn't because that's not how it
works. Still, I've got two kids, so I'd like to be," he pauses, then
grins, "I'd like to be comfortable."</TE>

<HD>The latest British import: rattling and pulsing Music</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Natalie Nichols</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On almost any night, you can go to the Troubadour to hear the music,
but you had to be there on Monday to hear the Music, a young British
quartet that's being touted in its native land as a leading rock
light.</LD>
<LD>   The Leeds, England, band's L.A. debut was sold out, indicating
early interest in a group whose self-titled debut album won't even be
released in the U.S. until February. Alternately spacey and driving,
the 70-minute set fetchingly blended the heavy guitar rock of Led
Zeppelin, the epic rattle and hum of U2 and the pulsing electronica
of the Chemical Brothers or the Prodigy (achieved with loads of
guitar effects rather than keyboards).</LD>
<LD>   Singer-guitarist Robert Harvey's elfish kung-fu stage moves
conveyed an arena-ready, eccentric confidence. But such songs as the
bombastic "The Dance" didn't so much regurgitate retro-rock as adapt
the classic sound to modern times, a la Jane's Addiction in its
heyday. The blues component was often more a feeling than a sound, as
in the lyrically minimal come-on "Take the Long Road and Walk It."</LD>
<TE>   The atmospheric songs didn't exactly have memorable hooks, but the
vibrating guitars and pounding drumbeats got under your skin. Despite
the tunes' erotic communal vibe, the show could have been sexier, and
Harvey's baggy jeans certainly didn't seal his freakish appeal the
way, say, a nice pair of leather pants might have.</TE>

<HD>'Together': An elegant sum of parts of the Sondheim canon</HD>
<DH>The classy quasi-revue returns in a nuanced staging by
International City Theatre.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David C. Nichols</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nonpareil ingenuity and depth of Stephen Sondheim dominates
"Putting It Together," the final offering of International City
Theatre's 2002 season in Long Beach. This quasi-revue embraces the
sophisticated wit and emotional point of America's foremost musical
dramatist head-on, courtesy of director Michael Michetti and a swank
ensemble.</LD>
<LD>   Conceived by Sondheim, Julia McKenzie and Cameron Mackintosh,
"Putting It Together" premiered as a 1992 Oxford workshop starring
Diana Rigg, followed by the 1993 Manhattan Theatre Club production
marking Julie Andrews' return to the New York stage after 30 years'
absence. Los Angeles first saw it at the Colony Studio Theatre in
1997, then in the 1998 Mark Taper version starring Carol Burnett,
which traveled to Broadway in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike its celebrated predecessor "Side by Side by Sondheim,"
"Together" has aspirations beyond showcasing Sondheim's songs.
Drawing on published and unused numbers from across the canon, the
show revises them to fit a scenario concerning the 25th anniversary
celebration of an affluent Manhattan couple (Colleen Fitzpatrick and
Hank Adams).</LD>
<TE>   They face off with each other and two young singles (Brittany
Paige and Tom Schmid), overseen by a Greek chorus-style observer
(Henry Polic II). This maneuvers the various complexities into a
sidelong examination of the human hunger for connection, from the
snappy opening title number to the electrifying, climactic rendition
of "Being Alive."</TE>
<TE>   Michetti's relaxed staging is admirably nuanced, with an eye for
the telling gesture and meaningful pause. Bradley Kaye's townhouse
setting, Steven Young's roseate lighting, and Scott A. Lane's chic
wardrobe are exactly right. Musical director Dan Redfeld's combo has
a syncopated finesse recalling the Terry Trotter Trio, and Paul
Fabre's sound design is discreet.</TE>
<TE>   The expert cast displays seamless vocal blend and keen
introspection. Adams' stalwart baritone and demeanor are most
effective, stilling the house in "The Road You Didn't Take" and "Good
Thing Going." Fitzpatrick plies her supple mezzo and classy
resemblance to '60s-era Janet Leigh with equal success.</TE>
<TE>   Their duet of "Country House" and her Act 1 curtain excavation of
"Could I Leave You?" are standouts.</TE>
<TE>   Schmid is marvelous, wrapping his dulcet tenor around "Live Alone
and Like It" and "Marry Me a Little" with breathtaking grace. Paige's
understated charm and fine-tuned soprano reach a virtuoso peak in
"More" from "Dick Tracy," done as brassy cousin to "Glitter and Be
Gay" from "Candide." While Polic is occasionally over-twinkly, his
affability suits the interlocutor's role, steering audience focus
throughout.</TE>
<TE>   Not every transplanted song works -- "Getting Married Today" from
"Company" as frenzied memory solo, for instance, or "Hello, Little
Girl" from "Into the Woods" as limp adult seduction. Given the
specificity that marks Sondheim's art, such lapses seem inevitable.
Still, if the functional limitations of the narrative conceit are
workmanlike at best, on balance "Putting It Together" is uncommonly
elegant entertainment, and certainly buffs should flock.</TE>

<LD>Are Bonnie and Clyde heroes or villains? What about Thelma and
Louise? Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid? No one disputes that
Freddie Krueger of "A Nightmare on Elm Street" is one of the big
screen's nastier villains, but can the same be said about the Blair
Witch, who is never seen on camera?</LD>
<LD>   Those are just some of the intriguing questions that some 1,500
members of the Hollywood creative community will grapple with as the
American Film Institute on Tuesday sent out ballots to name American
cinema's 50 greatest heroes and 50 greatest villains.</LD>
<LD>   Ballot names range from the Vampire, played by Theda Bara in
1915's "A Fool There Was," to Gandalf in "Lord of the Rings: The
Fellowship of the Ring," to Det. Alonzo Harris in "Training Day."</LD>
<TE>   The most-represented male actor on the ballot is John Wayne, with
seven different characters, while Bette Davis leads the actresses
with four.</TE>
<TE>   The ballot even includes animal characters, including the great
white shark in "Jaws."</TE>
<TE>   The vote will be announced during a three-hour special called
"AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Heroes &amp; Villains" that will be taped next
June for broadcast on CBS at a date to be determined.</TE>

<HD>Theater musicians fear replacement</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Boehm</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Broadway's pit musicians fear that producers are prepared to pull the
plug on them and plug in electronic replacements if the musicians'
union refuses to swallow cuts in the size of orchestras.</LD>
<LD>   The sides are preparing to negotiate a new contract, and producers
want to drop longstanding minimum staffing levels that require
anywhere from three to 26 players for book musicals, depending on
theater size. Broadway musicians currently earn $1,350 a week plus
pension and health benefits under a five-year deal that expires March
2.</LD>
<LD>   Advances in digital sound reproduction make it possible for a
single operator to run an orchestra-in-a-box -- and for shows to go
on should in-the-flesh musicians strike. "This is the first time we
have faced this serious a technological threat," Bill Moriarity,
president of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, said
Tuesday. "Our members' jobs are at stake."</LD>
<TE>   Reducing orchestra sizes -- or replacing musicians with
pre-programmed instrumental tracks -- would be "tampering with the
product" and would jeopardize the quality and artistic integrity of
the Broadway musical, Moriarity said. That's disputed by Jed
Bernstein, president of the League of American Theatres and
Producers, which represents Broadway theaters in negotiations: "The
concept of paying for people who are not artistically necessary for
the work has got to end." If there is a strike, Bernstein said, each
producer would decide independently whether to fill in with
machinery.</TE>

<LD>A West New York, N.J., resident has claimed the $1-million-plus prize
offered in the interactive game featured in the canceled ABC drama
"Push, Nevada."</LD>
<LD>   Mark Nakamoto, 24, an assistant manager of a Manhattan publishing
company, solved the series puzzle after watching the episodes and the
"Final Clue" broadcast during the Oct. 28 edition of "Monday Night
Football." The clue led viewers to a series of letters taken from the
episode, clues that, together with a cipher, corresponded to a
telephone number. Nakamota was the first viewer to call it.</LD>
<LD>   "Push, Nevada," about a mysterious desert town, premiered in
September but was quickly yanked after mixed reviews and small
audiences.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Television personality Sally Jessy Raphael on Tuesday filed a libel
lawsuit against the National Enquirer, alleging the tabloid falsely
reported she had suffered a mental breakdown after her long-running
talk show was canceled.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed in Manhattan federal court, asked for punitive
damages exceeding $100 million from the National Enquirer and its
parent, American Media Operations. The suit stemmed from a story in
the Oct. 22 issue that said the 59-year-old former host received
recent treatment in a clinic at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan.</LD>
<LD>   American Media stood behind the story's accuracy.</LD>

<HD>On mountaintops, Beats sought out some answers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After cinema, no art made in California is as widely appreciated --
or as influential -- as that of the Beats.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the work of such leading Beat writers as Kenneth Rexroth --
the movement's spiritual and aesthetic godfather -- Jack Kerouac,
Gary Synder, Allen Ginsberg, Michael McClure, Lawrence Ferlinghetti
and others is not only read and studied in schools across America,
but also in England, France, Germany and Japan.</LD>
<LD>   But what has been too often overlooked in such studies is that
Beats were among the 20th century's finest nature poets, and that
aspect of their art was decisively shaped by their lives in
California and the Northwest.</LD>
<TE>   As the Berkeley-based poet and critic Jack Foley puts it in an
unpublished revision of his seminal essay on the movement: "The Beat
Generation was one of the most publicized, misunderstood, attacked,
understood, deeply considered, cannibalized, ripped-off art movements
of the 20th century. Its influence extends from the adolescent
troubled about sexuality and identity to the dry-as-dust scholar
looking for history and significance in old books and papers. Whereas
the 'hippies' seem somewhat passe, sentimental and -- worst of all --
old, the even-older Beats ... have passed into history as American
artists of considerable importance."</TE>
<TE>   Despite such scrutiny, the Beats still are popularly perceived
around the world as urban bohemians -- habitues of jazz clubs and
coffeehouses, lonely walkers of existentially empty streets. "Partly
that's because Ginsberg was such a terrific publicist," said Foley,
noting it was the late poet who first conceived his work and that of
his friends as a movement. "It is through Allen's eyes that the Beats
initially passed into the public imagination. By 1958, the movement
had undergone a fundamental shift, but it is Jack and Allen in Times
Square that remains the powerful image."</TE>
<TE>   That fundamental shift, which has been documented not only in
Foley's recent work, but also in a new book by Boston photographer
and writer John Suiter -- "Poets on the Peaks: Gary Synder, Philip
Whalen &amp; Jack Kerouac in the North Cascades" (Counterpoint Press,
$40) -- put the experience of wild nature in California and the
Pacific Northwest at the very center of the Beats' work. It was,
moreover, wild nature experienced not in the traditional American
sense -- think Henry David Thoreau and tame little Walden Pond -- but
in the light of the Buddhist spirituality and practice that was then
common currency within the West Coast's avant-garde.</TE>
<TE>   At a three-day conference on the Beats last month at the John
Natsoulas Gallery in Davis, McClure argued that the Beats ought to be
seen "as the literary wing of the environmental movement." As McClure
recalled, one of the poems he recited at the Beats' coming-out party
-- the now legendary 1955 reading at San Francisco's 6 Gallery -- was
"FOR THE DEATH OF 100 WHALES." And "at the United Nations
Environmental Conference in Stockholm in 1972," McClure said, "Gary
Snyder and I were among the contingent of independent lobbyists ...
who took it upon themselves to represent whales, Indians and the
environment."</TE>
<TE>   One of the other insights to emerge from the Natsoulas conference
involved the consideration of the movement's leading visual artists,
including Los Angeles' Wallace Berman and George Herms and the Bay
Area's Bruce Conner. In light of McClure's point, it is possible to
regard their development of assemblage -- art made from found objects
-- as a prophetic statement of the recycling ethic.</TE>
<TE>   Still, nothing in recent years has made a greater contribution to
the understanding of the Beats as nature writers than Suiter's book.
Through photos, interviews, unpublished letters and journals, it
describes the decisive influence exerted on Snyder, Kerouac and
Whalen by the summers they spent in the early 1950s working as
solitary firewatchers along the Canadian border in the northern
Cascade range. In those years, firewatchers lived alone in one-room
mountaintop cabins very like ancient Buddhist hermitages, whose
inhabitants then preoccupied all three men. They had been encouraged
in their pursuits by Rexroth, himself a superb nature poet and
accomplished outdoorsman, as well as a translator of Japanese and
Chinese poetry.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Suiter was a 47-year-old photographer and teacher who had
done a number of well-received photo essays on Lowell, the
Massachusetts mill town where Kerouac grew up. On the basis of that
work, he was commissioned by the London Independent's Sunday
newspaper to spend two weeks in the firewatcher's cabin atop
Desolation Peak, where Kerouac had spent 63 days alone in the summer
of 1955. Those weeks provided the material for the climactic episode
of Kerouac's 1958 novel, "The Dharma Bums."</TE>
<TE>   "I went to Desolation in '95 to shoot a photo essay," Suiter said
this week. "I did an article about it and sent it to Gary Synder, who
I'd never met. He got back to me right away and said, 'This is great,
but how come you didn't shoot my lookout on Sourdough Peak, or
Philip's?'</TE>
<TE>   "On one level, Gary wanted to set the story straight, making the
point that he was the one who had led Kerouac up into the mountains.
But the whole story of their stays in the Cascades is something that
is very close to his heart, and he opened up to me."</TE>
<TE>   Suiter visited Synder at his home in the Sierra foothills near
Nevada City and, through him, was introduced not only to unpublished
written material about the movement and that period, but also to the
other writers. They included Snyder's old Reed College classmate,
Whalen, who recently had retired as abbot of a Zen monastery.</TE>
<TE>   "Philip was more unapproachable than Gary," Suiter recalled. "And,
by '97, when we began talking, he was retired and very ill. But we
hit it off, even though his health made it very painful for him to
cooperate. He died June 26, and I was very happy I was able to visit
and show him a copy of the book, which includes his portrait. He was
very blind, and we held the book four inches from his face and showed
him the portrait.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Oh,' he said, 'I look like a minor Charles Olsen,' " a hulking
poetic eminence in the 1950s avant-garde.</TE>
<TE>   Suiter is particularly pleased with the way his book helps place
Kerouac in the pantheon of nature writers. "Kerouac's attitude toward
nature is more complex than is readily apparent in his work. He grew
up in a river town, and that Merrimack River formed his understanding
of nature, particularly the epochal flood of 1936, which destroyed
his father's printing business. Kerouac's writerly ability to
describe nature is very good, but he never was able to sit at peace
within it, as Synder and Whalen could. He couldn't stay up there on
Desolation for 63 days without swinging wildly back and forth
emotionally. Synder was quite happy to stay there and almost had to
be dragged down by the other Forest Service workers in the fall."</TE>
<TE>   "My own life has been changed by this project," Suiter said. "It
has pulled my center of gravity into the mountains and much further
west. But I wouldn't have continued the project beyond Desolation if
it hadn't been for Gary. I needed living poets and a living
landscape, and I found both out there."</TE>

<HD>'The Big Griddle -- Just Like Home'</HD>
<DH>The story so far: Schmul, the leader of the Forbians,
believes that Albert is carrying something that will help protect his
people from the Kreekem. Albert has no idea what that thing might be.</DH>

<LD>Schmul and his red-suited followers waited for Albert to do something
amazing. Though Schmul seemed like a nice enough guy, and Albert
didn't want to disappoint him, Albert had no idea how to help him
out.</LD>
<LD>   While he tried to come up with a plan, Albert looked out the
window of the Forbush Big Griddle at the purple and green alien city.
The buildings, which looked like kitchen implements, all seemed to be
jumbled together.</LD>
<LD>   He wanted to help these guys, but more than that, he wanted to go
home.</LD>
<TE>   "Lots of luck," Albert said. "Can I go home now?"</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly. You may go home any time you want."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody moved.</TE>
<TE>   Albert sighed. "All right," he said. "Let's see if you can use any
of this stuff."</TE>
<TE>   He turned the pockets of his jeans inside out and heaped the
contents on the table before him. Enthusiastically, Schmul moved the
things around with one finger. Albert had some change in a leather
change purse, a dollar bill his grandmother had given him, a piece of
red string, a stubby pencil, an electronic doodad that someone told
him was a memory chip, and a plastic Shrek.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you have anything else?" Schmul asked.</TE>
<TE>   Albert shook his head.</TE>
<TE>   "What's in here?" Schmul asked as he picked up the change purse.</TE>
<TE>   Albert took it from him and dumped out two quarters, a dime, a
penny and his good luck piece. Ha! Some luck!</TE>
<TE>   Schmul picked up the good luck piece carefully, as if it were a
baby bird.</TE>
<TE>   He turned it over in his long bony hands. "This is it," he said
softly.</TE>
<TE>   His followers moaned.</TE>
<TE>   "It is?" Albert said with amazement. "It's just a piece of scrap
wood left over from the birdhouse my dad and I built."</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps," Schmul said as he stood up and ran.</TE>

<HD>Program is a touching tribute to 'Skin'</HD>
<DH>National Geographic special uses first-rate animation and
micro-photography to tell the fascinating story of our epidural
layer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joel Greenberg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spencer Tunick is realistic about his ultimate goal in life: "I
shouldn't be so confident that I can get the entire country naked,"
he says with a shrug.</LD>
<LD>   The photographer has become well known for organizing dozens to
thousands of nude volunteers into "performances" in which they are
grouped together, usually prone, to form a new shape; his photos are
records of these events.</LD>
<LD>   Tunick is the perfect protagonist for tonight's PBS program "Skin"
(8 p.m., KCET, KVCR), which celebrates and demystifies something we
go to such great lengths to cover up and expose at the same time.</LD>
<TE>   Like skin itself, the National Geographic special is slick,
smooth, colorful and coated with a tantalizing layer of sweat. Its
first-rate animation and micro-photography get under our skin and
into the blood vessels, fibers, sweat glands and nerves that
constitute the cell-making factories for our epidural layer.</TE>
<TE>   There is more than a little nudity in "Skin." Mostly, it's
Tunick's naked volunteers -- strewn at various angles to each other
for his portraits. But interestingly, the strongest hint of sex comes
not in views of the complete human form, but in the extreme close-ups
of fingertips, chins and arms glistening with sweat.</TE>
<TE>   It is touch that conveys perhaps the most important tribute to the
power of skin. At Miami's Jackson Hospital, Dr. Tiffany Field reports
stunning evidence that babies need to be touched and held in order to
thrive, perhaps even to survive. She found that premature babies gain
49% more weight and go home six days earlier when they are massaged
by elderly volunteers than babies who are not touched and held.
Moreover, the volunteers themselves also benefited. They reported
less depression and fewer doctor's visits than before they became
masseuses.</TE>

<LD>Receiving a lift from the CMA Awards, CBS recorded its sixth victory
in seven weeks during the first full week within the November rating
sweeps, while election-night coverage on competing channels helped
open the door for the WB's "Smallville" to soar to a new ratings
high, based on viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media
Research.</LD>
<LD>   The CMA Awards for country music drew a nearly identical audience
total compared with last year, despite stiffer-than-usual competition
from ABC, as "The Bachelor" provided a strong lead-in to a special
edition of "20/20" featuring the Osbournes. The interview delivered
ABC's highest series rating in that hour in over two years, better
than doubling the audience for the regular occupant, the new drama
"MDs."</LD>
<LD>   CBS' Sunday movie, by contrast, continues to post subpar results,
the latest coming for "Master Spy: The Robert Hanssen Story," a
two-part production that concludes this Sunday. Fox also has reason
to be concerned about "Malcolm in the Middle," which -- since moving
to "The X-Files' " old time slot at 9 p.m. -- has drawn mediocre
ratings.</LD>
<TE>   On the plus side, "24" fell a modest 12% from its heavily promoted
commercial-free premiere despite the record tune-in for "Smallville"
in its time slot.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's "Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit" drew its biggest
audience this season Friday, even surpassing the original "Law &amp;
Order" -- which NBC has dubbed "the mother ship" -- in the L.A.
viewing area.</TE>

<HD>Oscar's lady in waiting</HD>
<DH>Four veterans are early favorites for best actress nods.
Could the academy go 'Greek' for the fifth spot?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert W. Welkos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Picture this: Inside the Kodak Theatre on the evening of March 23,
2003, Nicole Kidman, Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore and Renee Zellweger
wait eagerly for Denzel Washington to open the envelope and reveal
this year's best actress.</LD>
<LD>   "And the winner is ... Nia Vardalos!"</LD>
<LD>   OK, it is far-fetched. Conventional wisdom in Tinseltown holds
that Vardalos, the former Second City comedian who wrote and starred
in the worldwide indie blockbuster "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," is at
best a dark horse to be nominated for an Oscar, let alone win.
Perhaps a Golden Globe, or even an Academy Award for best adapted
screenplay, but not for best actress.</LD>
<TE>   The Vardalos scenario illustrates an intriguing development for
this year's race. If Kidman, Streep, Moore and Zellweger are the
leading candidates for Academy Award nominations, who is the fifth?</TE>
<TE>   Based largely on word-of-mouth from people who have attended
advance screenings, those four actresses appear to be early
favorites: Kidman as author Virginia Woolf and Streep as a modern-day
"Mrs. Dalloway" in the cross-generational drama "The Hours"; Moore as
the quintessential 1950s housewife who must deal with racism in her
community and her husband's secret life as a homosexual in "Far From
Heaven"; and Zellweger as a homicidal dancer in the musical
"Chicago."</TE>
<TE>   If this scenario plays out, the fifth and final nomination would
be up for grabs and the resulting competition could be fierce.</TE>
<TE>   In one corner, contenders include veterans such as Diane Lane in
"Unfaithful," Sigourney Weaver in "The Guys," Catherine Deneuve in "8
Women" and Emily Watson in "Punch-Drunk Love," not to mention former
Oscar winners Ellen Burstyn in "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya
Sisterhood" and Gwyneth Paltrow in "Possession."</TE>
<TE>   In the other corner are relative newcomers such as Vardalos in "My
Big Fat Greek Wedding," Jennifer Aniston in "The Good Girl," Salma
Hayek in "Frida," Alison Lohman in "White Oleander" and Maggie
Gyllenhaal in "Secretary."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
has shown that it appreciates quality performances in the best
actress category, whether by major stars or virtual novices.</TE>
<TE>   Hilary Swank was a 25-year-old ingenue when she won the 1999 Oscar
for best actress as a cross-dressing youth who is savagely murdered
in a Nebraska town in "Boys Don't Cry."</TE>
<TE>   The next year, academy voters rewarded superstar Julia Roberts
with a golden statuette for her signature performance as a divorced
mother who brings a giant California utility to its knees in "Erin
Brockovich."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the Oscar went to Halle Berry, whose beauty
often obscured her acting ability until "Monster's Ball," a gritty,
independent movie about prison guards and racial bigotry, came along.</TE>
<TE>   How does this year shape up?</TE>
<TE>   "I think people are looking for something different, something to
talk about," said David Thomson, author of "The New Biographical
Dictionary of Film." That's why he won't rule out Vardalos, even
though she stars in a family comedy, which academy voters tend to
ignore.</TE>
<TE>   Thomson also likes Aniston in "The Good Girl."</TE>
<TE>   "That, to me, was the kind of performance that impressed the
industry. You have somebody doing comedy effortlessly for years on
television and she takes on a more serious, more demanding role, one
that doesn't seem suited to her," he noted. "Now, the film was not a
huge hit. That's important, although 'Monster's Ball' was not a big
hit when [Berry] was nominated."</TE>
<TE>   One performance that hasn't received much attention in the U.S. is
British actress Samantha Morton in "Morvern Callar." The film, which
could be too obscure for Oscar voters, tells the story of a
supermarket clerk in a Scottish port town who awakens Christmas
morning to find that her boyfriend has committed suicide -- and
decides not to tell anyone.</TE>
<TE>   "She's staggering," Thomson said of Morton, who was nominated for
supporting actress in "Sweet and Lowdown," but "it's a small,
English, independent film. Whether it will get a push or anything, I
don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Rainer, the New York magazine film critic who also is
chairman of the National Society of Film Critics, said that what
strikes him about this year is the number of films in which many
actresses give strong performances. "There seems to be a pileup of
nominated actresses in multiple roles this year in both lead and
supporting categories," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Hours," for example, Kidman, Streep and Moore could all
qualify for best actress, since each appears in roughly a third of
the film. Yet Paramount Pictures plans to conduct Oscar campaigns on
behalf of Kidman and Streep for best actress, positioning Moore for
best supporting actress. Moore, obviously, has a lot to say about it,
and this would free Focus Films to launch an Oscar campaign on her
behalf as best actress for "Far From Heaven."</TE>
<TE>   "If one is talking about nominating Julianne Moore," Rainer said,
"it is much more likely it will happen in that film, especially if
Kidman and Streep are nominated for 'The Hours.' " Besides, he said,
the academy "would consider it a bit much putting all three actresses
from the same film" up for best actress.</TE>
<TE>   In "White Oleander," Michelle Pfeiffer delivers what many consider
one of her most compelling performances as a mother imprisoned for
murdering a lover, but Warner Bros. has decided to position her for
best supporting actress and mount a best-actress campaign for Lohman,
who received strong reviews as Pfeiffer's troubled daughter.</TE>
<TE>   One possible surprise is Lane, whose performance in "Unfaithful"
garnered good reviews even though the movie was not a breakout hit.
Also hindering Lane's chances is that the film came out in June.
"Coming out early in the year is always an uphill struggle," Rainer
said. "The film had mixed reviews. She is sort of a sentimental
favorite who has been around the business since she was a kid. She's
a good actress who never quite landed a great role."</TE>
<TE>   As for Kidman, Rainer said her divorce from Tom Cruise could
actually enhance her chances since many in Hollywood came to
sympathize with her. "I think Hollywood, as nasty as it can be, can
also be very gushy and, in her case, I think there is more sympathy
since her split-up than there is with him," Rainer said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the more intriguing questions is what academy voters will
think of Gyllenhaal, whose movie "Secretary" revolves around a young
woman with a pain fetish who likes to be spanked by her boss.</TE>
<TE>   The subject of sadomasochism might be too offensive for some
academy voters, but the film and Gyllenhaal have garnered their share
of strong reviews. Roger Ebert wrote that Gyllenhaal "avoids numerous
opportunities to make her character seem pathetic, and makes her seem
plucky instead -- intent on establishing herself and making herself
necessary." The Times' Manohla Dargis wrote that the actress "makes
the character more complex than it's written."</TE>
<TE>   "You could not persuade anybody to see 'Secretary' if Maggie
didn't walk an extremely fine line throughout all of that film," said
Tom Ortenberg, president of Lions Gate Films, which plans to
aggressively push Gyllenhaal for best actress.</TE>
<TE>   That brings us to Vardalos. Her made-for-Hollywood Cinderella
story could win over voters. Plus, her movie was produced by industry
heavyweights Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson. "It's not out of
the question by any means," Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy
said of Vardalos' chances of capturing an Oscar nod for best actress.
"People sympathize with her story, playing the role herself instead
of letting others do it .... I think she'll probably get a huge
Golden Globe push that might be contagious" with voters.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Goetzman, co-producer of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," said the
movie has been such a phenomenal success that academy voters are well
aware of the movie and her performance.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost everybody in the United States has seen this picture or
known people who have," he said. "It doesn't require us to say, 'Hey,
here is a picture you've missed.' They can judge it for what it is
and act accordingly."</TE>

<LD>Terrorism suspects photo -- A photo caption that appeared Saturday in
Section A contained unconfirmed information. The caption said that
the photograph depicted prisoners, who were bound and shackled, being
transported to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. However, as the accompanying
story reported, a Pentagon spokesman said it had not been determined
where the plane was going or when the photos were taken. The photo,
distributed to the media, had appeared on the Web site of radio talk
show host Art Bell with the headline "Anonymous mailer sends us
photos taken inside a military C-130 transporting POWs."</LD>

<HD>De Castro Steps Down as AOL Programming Chief</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edmund Sanders</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The management shakeup at AOL Time Warner Inc.'s Internet unit
continued Tuesday as executive James de Castro -- hired just seven
months ago to lead America Online's interactive services -- announced
his resignation after being passed over for the top spot at the
Dulles, Va.-based unit.</LD>
<LD>   De Castro, 48, was hired by former AOL Time Warner Chief Operating
Officer Robert Pittman to handle the programming and content for
AOL's online service, including its latest version, AOL 8.0.</LD>
<LD>   He had hoped to take over leadership duties for the entire online
unit after Pittman departed under pressure in July. But the post
instead went to outsider Jonathan Miller, former head of USA
Interactive.</LD>
<TE>   De Castro said he would look for a job as chief executive at
another company.</TE>
<TE>   "With the completion of [the 8.0] launch, Jon Miller's arrival and
the restructuring of the management team, I'm now looking for an
opportunity to run a company," he said.</TE>
<TE>   During his short tenure, de Castro developed a loyal following
inside AOL. He was known for leading 8 a.m. spin-cycling classes at
the company's headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "Jimmy infused the whole place with new energy," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   His duties will be taken over by AOL veteran Ted Leonsis, who is
resuming a more active role at the company as vice chairman of the
Dulles division.</TE>
<TE>   There are no plans to replace de Castro, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   De Castro's departure comes three weeks before Miller plans to
unveil a turnaround plan for investors. The Dec. 3 analysts meeting
in New York will include details about how AOL plans to shift its
customers from dial-up connections to high-speed broadband access.</TE>
<TE>   The online company, a unit of New York-based AOL Time Warner, has
been rocked this year by management changes, a slowdown in growth and
a series of accounting problems that are now the subject of a federal
criminal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner's shares rose 11 cents to $15.06 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>California Wins Arbitration Ruling</HD>
<DH>Judge tosses out lawsuit by NYSE and NASD challenging
state's disclosure rules in stockholder disputes.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Handing California a major victory, a federal judge in San Francisco
on Tuesday tossed out a lawsuit challenging the state's tough
disclosure rules for arbitrators who hear complaints about
stockbrokers.</LD>
<LD>   The New York Stock Exchange and the NASD filed suit in federal
court in July challenging the state Judicial Council's authority to
establish guidelines for the arbitrators who hear complaints from
investors.</LD>
<LD>   The NYSE and the NASD, formerly known as the National Assn. of
Securities Dealers, called the state's rules cumbersome and in
conflict with their ethics rules for arbitrators.</LD>
<TE>   But U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti ruled late Tuesday that the
Judicial Council is protected from being sued in federal court. Conti
said that in this case, the 11th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
"prohibits naming state agencies and departments as defendants."</TE>
<TE>   The NYSE and the NASD are in a tough position as they decide
whether to appeal Conti's decision, a process that could take a year
or more. Thousands of arbitrations have backed up because the NYSE
and the NASD have refused to provide arbitration panels in California
since the new rules were imposed.</TE>
<TE>   The rules require private judges -- including arbitrators in
securities cases -- to reveal financial and other ties they and their
families have with parties to the disputes.</TE>
<TE>   The NASD, which handles the vast majority of disputes with
stockbrokers, had been providing arbitration panels -- but only if
investors would agree to have their cases heard under existing NYSE
and NASD rules, which are approved by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   NYSE spokesman Ray Pellechia and NASD spokeswoman Nancy Condon
declined to comment, saying they had not had time to review the
decision fully.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Joseph W. Cotchett, whose Burlingame, Calif., law firm
was chief counsel for the state, called the decision "a tremendous
victory for California consumers" by reaffirming the state's right to
set standards for arbitration of disputes between investors and their
stockbrokers.</TE>
<TE>   The Judicial Council, which oversees the state's judicial system,
wrote the disclosure rules as a result of a law passed by the state
Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict took a heated turn when lawyers for the NYSE and the
NASD sent process servers into the courtrooms of some of the judges
on the Judicial Council, serving them with notice of the lawsuit
while their courts were in session. Ronald M. George, chief justice
of the California Supreme Court and a Judicial Council member, said
in an e-mail responding to complaints that he found the tactic
"highly offensive."</TE>
<TE>   Conti's decision also is a defeat for the SEC, which had filed a
"friend of the court" brief signed by outgoing commission Chairman
Harvey L. Pitt saying it supported the single national standard for
ethical disclosures by arbitrators.</TE>
<TE>   When investors open accounts with brokerages, they must agree to
submit disputes to arbitration. Cotchett said Tuesday's ruling could
apply to hospitals, car-rental agencies and other businesses that
sometimes require consumers to settle disputes through arbitration
rather than in court.</TE>

<HD>Broadcom Names Operating Chief</HD>
<DH>Board member Alan 'Lanny' Ross will recruit senior
executives and handle internal operations as the chip company
restructures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Glenda McCarthy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Broadcom Inc. named board member Alan "Lanny" Ross, a retired
executive with extensive experience in the semiconductor industry, to
the newly created position of chief operating officer.</LD>
<LD>   The Irvine-based chip company, which last month announced a
restructuring to cut costs, said Ross' role will be to recruit senior
executives and handle internal operations. He will hold the position
on an interim basis.</LD>
<LD>   Broadcom said last month that it planned to cut operating expenses
by 10% to 12%, including an unspecified number of jobs, as part of a
restructuring designed to focus on its best-performing businesses.
The company posted a $2.7-billion loss last year amid the
industrywide slump.</LD>
<TE>   "We are going to take significant cost-cutting actions, so my
first priority is to get that executed on a timely basis," Ross said.</TE>
<TE>   The company expects to complete the cuts by the end of the
quarter, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The appointment will allow Chief Executive Henry Nicholas to focus
on strategy and customer transactions, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Ross retired in 1996 as president of Rockwell International
Corp.'s telecommunications group, which included the chip business
that later was spun off into Newport Beach-based Conexant Systems
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   He previously held senior positions at National Semiconductor
Corp. and Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc. He joined
Broadcom's board in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts praised the decision, saying Broadcom needs well-seasoned
management to handle its growth and challenging times now and ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcom shares rose 59 cents, or 5%, to $11.91, on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Taps Diller for Bigger Corporate Role</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood deal maker Barry Diller is taking his act to a bigger
stage, to an audience that doesn't care whether he can speak French
because he knows how to read the universal language: the bottom line.</LD>
<LD>   Diller has been tapped by Vivendi Universal's top executive,
Jean-Rene Fourtou, to play the part of interim co- chief executive of
the ailing Paris-based conglomerate as it tries to sort out its
identity and finances, according to sources close to Diller and the
company.</LD>
<LD>   Already chairman of Vivendi Universal Entertainment, Diller is
being handed the bigger corporate role as the French parent is trying
to ease investor concerns about the stability and competence of its
management team.</LD>
<TE>   The move also comes amid criminal investigations in France and the
United States over allegations of financial improprieties, including
whether Vivendi's former chief executive misled investors about the
severity of the company's financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   Since the ouster of former CEO Jean-Marie Messier in a boardroom
coup, Hollywood corridors have been rife with speculation about the
future of Universal and Diller, who is widely known for his business
savvy and survival instincts.</TE>
<TE>   Some suggest that Diller, who has remained silent about his
long-range plans, is positioning himself to take the helm of a
reconfigured Universal should it be spun off into a separate entity
with publicly traded stock. Under that scenario, sources have said,
Vivendi would retain a major stake in the company.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi board members are said to be eager to give the company a
clearer mission by ultimately severing the U.S. entertainment
holdings. One reason investors lost confidence in the company was
because of its seemingly ill-conceived mixture of assets, from sewage
plants to record labels.</TE>
<TE>   Diller is expected to remain in his unofficial new role until
Vivendi decides on the future of its Universal holdings, which were
acquired two years ago in a three-way, $34-billion merger that
included French pay-TV company Canal Plus.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Diller nor Fourtou would comment on Vivendi's management
structure. But sources say the men, despite different personalities,
have formed a close relationship since Fourtou took the helm this
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou, a former pharmaceutical executive who acknowledges
knowing little about Hollywood, has been relying on Diller for his
entertainment industry expertise, as well as for advice on Vivendi's
overall corporate strategy as its attempts to pare its $19-billion
debt and sell money-losing ventures.</TE>
<TE>   Diller ran Paramount Pictures in the 1970s and oversaw the
creation of the Fox broadcasting network in the next decade. He
became chairman of Vivendi Universal Entertainment after the French
conglomerate bought his USA cable network and studio.</TE>
<TE>   During his long run in Hollywood, Diller gained a reputation on
Wall Street as a man with a golden touch.</TE>
<TE>   Now that he will be spending more time on Vivendi's overall
corporate strategy, the company will backfill for him, sources close
to the studio say.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi is expected to promote Kenneth Cron, who heads the
company's profitable computer and video games division. Sources say
he will be given the title of chief operating officer of Universal's
entertainment assets, including the theme parks, cable operations and
the studio, which will continue to be overseen by Ron Meyer.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Universal's music division, the world's largest, also
may be added to Cron's portfolio. It too will continue to be run by
its current chief, Doug Morris.</TE>
<TE>   Cron, 45, widely known within the world of video and online games,
will instantly become a major player in the high-stakes world of film
and television. He was picked, sources said, because of his strong
entrepreneurial skills.</TE>
<TE>   Cron joined Vivendi early last year when it bought his online
games firm, Uproar Inc. Since then, he has presided over an empire
that generates more than $600 million in annual revenue and employs
1,800 people in seven development studios.</TE>
<TE>   In his new position, Cron will report to Diller, sources said. The
appointments have not been officially announced.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers James Bates, Alex Pham and Anita M. Busch
contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Fiscal Policy Redux</HD>
<DH>Proposals for managing the sagging economy will abound in
the next few months.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter G. Gosselin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Listen to the post-election hubbub about more tax cuts and you can
hear the ghost of a long-dismissed government strategy: fiscal
policy.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, politicians talk about "fiscal stimulus" whenever the
economy sags, and sometimes even pass the requisite tax cuts and
spending increases as they did this year and last. But for two
decades, the White House and Congress have been little more than bit
players in an economic drama dominated by the Federal Reserve.</LD>
<LD>   No more. With short-term interest rates near zero, the era of Fed
ascendancy is over. A new age of fiscal policy is about to begin.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to get a big new dose of fiscal policy, come hell or
high water," predicted Brookings Institution economist Robert E.
Litan.</TE>
<TE>   Talk of more tax cuts is one measure of the uneasiness people feel
about an economy that, while no longer shrinking, seems unable to
grow strongly. It also is a gauge of people's surprise -- even shock
-- at the idea that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan may be running out of
tricks to cushion economic blows and manage growth.</TE>
<TE>   "The Federal Reserve has given you the impression it can fine-tune
the economy," said Bank of America chief economist Mickey D. Levy.
"Guess what? It can't."</TE>
<TE>   And neither can the White House and Congress, so the conventional
wisdom has been. Indeed, the conviction that fiscal policy doesn't
work has been a staple of Republican orthodoxy since the boom of the
1960s turned into the inflation of the 1970s, helping to pave the way
for Ronald Reagan, the country's rightward shift and the election of
the current president.</TE>
<TE>   But if the economy continues to perform poorly, the president and
the new congressional Republican majority probably will respond --
particularly because of what happened to the first President Bush,
whose 1992 re-election bid foundered when a mild recession similar to
last year's gave way to an anemic recovery like this year's. Whatever
doubts they may still harbor about fiscal policy, they can comfort
themselves with the knowledge that it once worked brilliantly, if
only briefly.</TE>
<TE>   The moment was 1963. The president was John Kennedy. The problem
was an economy stuck in low gear with unemployment at about 7%.
Kennedy's advisors argued for what was at the time the largest income
tax cut ever approved. Within a year of its passage, unemployment had
dropped to 4% and the country was roaring forward.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fiscal policy's shining moment, one it has never been able
to repeat," said UC San Diego historian Michael A. Bernstein. Within
a few years, Kennedy's successor, Lyndon Johnson, was forced to seek
a tax increase in an unsuccessful attempt to slow growth and dampen
inflation.</TE>
<TE>   Despite this checkered past, fiscal policy proposals will abound
in the next few months largely because fiscal policy is the only game
left in town. That being so, here is a brief viewer's guide to the
coming debate:</TE>
<TE>   * What counts as fiscal policy and what doesn't?</TE>
<TE>   White House officials already have signaled they generally favor
renewing a 13-week extension of unemployment compensation benefits
due to expire in December, and are interested in new tax breaks for
investors who lost large sums in the stock market. Both would count
as fiscal policy because they would prop up the economy by helping
people continue to spend.</TE>
<TE>   But the president has said that one of his biggest priorities will
be to make his 10-year, $1.35- trillion tax-cut package permanent.
That wouldn't count. "It's not going to make a bit of difference to
the economy in the next year or two," said David Hale, chief
economist at Zurich Financial Services in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   * What is "discretionary" and what is "automatic"?</TE>
<TE>   Critics of fiscal policy argue that Congress and the White House
take so long to settle on specific measures that the economic
problems they are designed to solve usually have disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   When they do get the timing right -- as they did with last year's
installment of the president's tax-cut package -- it's generally dumb
luck.</TE>
<TE>   But such criticism -- which will inevitably be heard in the coming
debate -- focuses on only one kind of fiscal policy, the kind that is
discretionary and requires votes by Congress and approvals by the
president to turn on or off.</TE>
<TE>   But there is another kind of fiscal policy that is generally less
controversial, the "automatic" programs that kick in when the economy
is in trouble and bolster it, and turn off when the problem is over.
Examples are unemployment compensation and, surprisingly, corporate
income taxes, which plummet along with profits in a downturn,
relieving companies of the burden of paying them, and then come back
during recoveries.</TE>
<TE>   Watch for whether proposals fall into the discretionary or
automatic category.</TE>
<TE>   * Which fiscal policy measures do Republicans favor and which do
Democrats favor?</TE>
<TE>   In general, Republicans want to help business and investors,
arguing that savings and investment are the economy's weakest links.
The Democrats favor proposals that help low- and moderate-income
Americans such as suspending Social Security and Medicare taxes for
six months.</TE>
<TE>   The divisions could stall action as they have so many times
before. But if the economy continues stumbling, watch for the
differences to be quickly bridged.</TE>

<HD>Major TV Networks to Make Shared Bid for Emmy Telecast</HD>
<DH>At its board meeting tonight, the Academy of Television
Arts &amp; Sciences will weigh the offer against HBO's proposal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The four major television networks are expected to offer a bid today
of at least $5 million annually to continue broadcasting the Emmy
Awards under a shared arrangement, industry sources say. That would
leave the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences to choose between the
networks' or a higher bid from Home Box Office heading into tonight's
scheduled board meeting.</LD>
<LD>   If the nonprofit organization accepts the networks' fee, it would
forgo millions from cable TV powerhouse HBO, whose $10-million-a-year
proposal -- matching the academy's asking price -- surfaced Monday.</LD>
<LD>   If HBO telecasts the show it would move the Emmys off broadcast
television for the first time, and the Academy may face reprisals --
including a possible network boycott -- that could jeopardize its
future.</LD>
<TE>   If the latter scenario sounds like an Emmy-worthy melodrama, those
who know Emmy history say the threat is real. CBS, a unit of Viacom
Inc., already has warned that it will withdraw any support from the
academy should the North Hollywood-based group pick HBO -- just as
the networks retaliated when the academy struck exclusive deals with
News Corp.'s young Fox network in 1987 and ABC in the early 1990s.
HBO is owned by AOL Time Warner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Although the networks spend more for similar programming,
including award shows such as the Grammys and Oscars, they have long
been reluctant to significantly increase an Emmy fee that the academy
says undervalues the television industry's top award -- a showcase
that reliably attracts millions of viewers each September.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, however, the only way to secure a sizable raise has
been to break from the current format, in which the networks take
turns broadcasting the show, and court a single buyer.</TE>
<TE>   That could unleash threats from the networks, including the
prospect of establishing a competing awards show and seeking to
dissuade their talent from attending.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the decision will rest with the academy's board of
governors, which consists of volunteers representing each of 27
industry peer groups -- from makeup/hairstylists and sound editors to
actors, writers and directors, many of whom work on programs carried
by the major networks.</TE>
<TE>   Network officials and academy insiders have expressed concern that
the fate of the organization -- whose image within the industry has
suffered at times because of internal infighting and politics --
could hang in the balance.</TE>
<TE>   "If the networks withdraw, this really could be the end of the
Emmys as we know them," said one former governor, on condition of
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox have broadcast the Emmys on a rotating basis
since 1994, paying about $3 million annually -- a fraction of the $50
million that ABC pays for the Oscars and $25 million CBS shells out
for the Grammys, though those presenting bodies cover their
respective production costs.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the networks thus far had offered only a nominal increase
-- sources say between 10% and 15% -- to extend the agreement.</TE>

<HD>Quarrel at Ports Risks Driving Business From L.A.</HD>

<LD>The dockworkers and shipping lines are set to resume their on-again,
off-again negotiations in San Francisco today, and the hope is that
they'll find a way to settle their differences and reach a new labor
contract.</LD>
<LD>   If that happens, local development officials are sure to hail the
outcome and predict more heady growth for the West Coast ports. The
10-day lockout that roiled the nation's economy last month will fast
become, for most people, a faint memory.</LD>
<LD>   But in truth, the world is changing, and the longshore union and
shipping companies need to wake up to this fact.</LD>
<TE>   As the dispute at the ports has caused the global supply chain to
become knotted, major companies that import goods through Los Angeles
and Long Beach already have started searching for alternative routes.</TE>
<TE>   "Firms that do business on a global scale no longer can tolerate
disruptions," says James Prendergast, who heads supply-chain
management services for IBM Corp.'s consulting arm.</TE>
<TE>   Adds Dominic Ng, chairman of East West Bancorp, a lender to Asian
entrepreneurs in the L.A. area: "People are trying to figure out how
to do business differently in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Robin Lanier, director of the West Coast Waterfront Coalition,
says that Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp., Home Depot Inc. and
other big retailers are thinking seriously of moving more of their
merchandise through East Coast ports.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it may cost those companies large sums to bring Asian goods
through Egypt's Suez Canal to Charleston, S.C., and the docks of New
York and New Jersey. But such a move could have a payoff, as well:
Already, most of the cargo coming into California's ports winds up on
trains heading east.</TE>
<TE>   Shipping to the East Coast would bring goods in "closer to the big
retailers headquarters facilities and most of their customers," says
Lanier. "The majority of Americans still live east of the Mississippi
River."</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are high. Movements of imports and exports through the
great seaports and area airports is now the largest source of
employment in Southern California -- more than 400,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Realistically, most of the growing trade in apparel, consumer and
industrial goods and toys coming from China and the rest of Asia will
continue to flow through West Coast ports, particularly the L.A.-Long
Beach complex, which together handled more than $200 billion in cargo
in the last fiscal year. That was more than double the volume of
goods that moved through New York and New Jersey, and many times the
$33 billion worth that came through Charleston, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the advantages of L.A. and Long Beach are formidable --
and won't be overcome overnight: a depth of 65 feet, greater than any
U.S. port; a vast infrastructure of container-unloading equipment; a
plethora of rail connections; and a large home market in Southern
California itself.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the message of the retailers and other global companies is
unmistakable: L.A. and Long Beach do not have a lock on trade, and
can't take their position for granted.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be surprised if there were a single big company not
thinking about alternatives," says a spokesman for Honda Motor Co.,
which ships car parts through Los Angeles but has started exploring
potential routes through Mexico to get supplies to its factories in
Ohio and Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   Some are looking to have backup sources of supplies right in the
U.S., so they're not captive to the ports. "You have to have a second
source as a default," says Hau Lee, a professor of operations
information and technology at Stanford University's Graduate School
of Business. "A local supplier can give you that flexibility."</TE>
<TE>   In the face of these trends, leaders at the West Coast ports --
both labor and management -- must work harder than ever to ensure
future growth.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Stark, president of Weber Distribution, a logistics firm
in Santa Fe Springs, says the ports could do more business if they
installed a fully automated system of "data transfer and high-speed
rail to move the goods rapidly."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the local ports and shipping firms must continue to
invest as much as $500 million a year in modernization during this
decade if they are to keep up with the standards being set by the
Asian ports of Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   Officials also must pay attention to the environment. More
restrictions will be imposed unless the shipping lines and longshore
union streamline procedures to get trucks on and off the docks in a
more timely fashion and work to clean up some of the air pollution at
the ports.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the longshore union and shipping lines must recognize
that every time they dig in their heels and can't reach an accord,
they are putting one of the most powerful engines of the Southern
California economy at considerable risk. Should there be another
lockout or strike in 2002 -- or another port shutdown when the next
contract expires in three short years -- "that would do real damage,"
warns Stark.</TE>
<TE>   Both the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach project 6% annual
growth in cargo in the years ahead, a pace that would bring them to
$300 billion in trade around 2009.</TE>
<TE>   But nobody should kid themselves. They will only get there if all
the parties at the ports have learned a lesson from the troubles this
time around.</TE>

<HD>IRS Seeks to Claim Tax on Offshore Moves</HD>
<DH>New regulations require filing on transactions to help the
agency track reincorporations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The federal government Tuesday fired another salvo at companies that
seek to locate their headquarters offshore in a bid to save on taxes.</LD>
<LD>   The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service issued
temporary regulations requiring Cooper Industries Ltd., Nabors
Industries Ltd. and Noble Corp. to file a Form 1099 reporting their
stocks' fair market value at the time they reincorporated in Bermuda
or the Cayman Islands.</LD>
<LD>   By reincorporating offshore while keeping operating headquarters
in the United States -- so-called corporate inversions -- the
companies sought to avoid U.S. taxes on their overseas profits. But
the move itself generates a "toll tax" equivalent to a capital gains
tax as shares in the U.S. entity are exchanged for shares in the new
offshore corporation.</LD>
<TE>   That's the tax the IRS and Treasury are trying to capture with the
new regulations.</TE>
<TE>   The tax agency also proposed regulations to require all companies
to report to the IRS and shareholders any transaction that may be
subject to tax. The regulations would affect some corporate mergers,
reorganizations and changes in ownership.</TE>
<TE>   Both sets of regulations are part of the government's effort to
ensure that U.S. companies that move offshore don't avoid U.S. taxes
entirely.</TE>
<TE>   "The regulations issued today will serve to remind shareholders in
taxable inversion transactions that they must report their gain from
the transactions on their tax returns," said Pamela Olson, the
Treasury's assistant secretary for tax policy.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier rules didn't require reporting on such moves.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS will be able to cross-check the information from the 1099
forms with taxpayers' returns to ensure that the required capital
gains tax is paid.</TE>
<TE>   Capital gains rates range from 8% to 38.6%, based on income level
and how long the stock was owned. Most people pay a rate of 20%.</TE>
<TE>   The 1099 reporting requirement affects only companies that
completed a corporate inversion this year. Those include Cooper
Industries and Nabors, which moved to Bermuda, and Noble, which
reincorporated in the Cayman Islands.</TE>
<TE>   Nabors spokesman Dennis Smith said he hadn't seen any new IRS
regulations, but "we'll do whatever the law requires." Messages left
with spokesmen for Coopers and Noble weren't returned.</TE>
<TE>   The rule also would affect shareholders of Seagate Technology
Holdings if it incorporates in the Cayman Islands, an intention the
company recently announced.</TE>
<TE>   Scotts Valley, Calif.-based Seagate, the largest computer
disk-drive maker, is planning to raise as much as $1 billion in an
initial public stock offering.</TE>
<TE>   Public outcry over the practice of moving headquarters offshore,
along with a stream of legislation proposing to restrict or ban the
practice, have forced many companies to reconsider the idea.</TE>
<TE>   One example: Stanley Works, a Connecticut-based toolmaker,
abandoned its plans to reincorporate in Bermuda after a barrage of
criticism and publicity.</TE>

<HD>WB Founders' Stake Bought by AOL</HD>
<DH>In a $110-million offer, Jamie Kellner and eight others
took a buyout of their 11% in the network they launched in 1995.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sallie Hofmeister</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner has agreed to pay Jamie Kellner and eight other
founding executives of the WB television network nearly $110 million
in January for their 11% stake, setting the total value of the
7-year-old network at about $1 billion, according to several people
with knowledge of the deal.</LD>
<LD>   AOL Time Warner said the agreement was negotiated in the spring of
2001 as part of Kellner's promotion to his current job as chief
executive of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. The buyout was designed
to prevent Kellner, who founded the WB in 1995 with Time Warner as a
majority partner, from any conflicts of interest that could arise
from his expanded role over the WB, as well as cable channels
including CNN, TBS, TNT, and the Cartoon Network.</LD>
<LD>   AOL Time Warner management feared that without a buyout agreement
at a set price, Kellner would have a financial incentive to funnel
the best programming to the WB rather than one of the other networks
he was adding to his portfolio.</LD>
<TE>   The agreement, buried in a phrase in AOL Time Warner's 2001 annual
report, will increase AOL Time Warner's stake in the WB to 77.5%,
from the current 66.5%. Tribune Co., owner of the Los Angeles Times,
owns the remaining 22.5% of the WB.</TE>
<TE>   The little-noticed disclosure was first reported on Tuesday by the
New York Post.</TE>
<TE>   However, many at AOL Time Warner have been well-aware of the plan.
In anticipation of the buyout, Kellner and Garth Ancier, a WB
executive, distributed bonus checks to some 250 WB employees at last
year's network Christmas party at a Los Angeles night club.</TE>
<TE>   Neither AOL Time Warner nor Tribune would comment on the buyout
price.</TE>
<TE>   Despite speculation for months that Kellner was eager to return to
Los Angeles from Turner Broadcasting's Atlanta-based headquarters,
company officials reiterated that he intends to fulfill his contract,
which expires in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Turner Broadcasting executives say the huge payout could
create tensions within the Atlanta offices, especially at a time when
AOL Time Warner is struggling financially and accounting practices at
its America Online unit are under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The WB is having its best season yet, with ratings up 25% among
viewers 18 to 34 years old, even as viewership among the major
networks is flat.</TE>

<HD>Kohl's Announces Southland Stores</HD>
<DH>The Wisconsin-based retailer plans to open 28 stores in
cities including Ventura and Riverside in its push West.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Abigail Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kohl's Corp., a retailer known for selling trendy, brand-name apparel
at value prices, said Tuesday that it will open 28 stores in Southern
California in the spring, the company's first foray into Southern
California and its biggest step toward expansion throughout the
Western United States.</LD>
<LD>   Financial analysts and shoppers familiar with the Wisconsin-based
retailer have been waiting for official word of the company's move
here, rumored for more than a year, because of the company's success
in offering middle-market shoppers a jazzy alternative.</LD>
<LD>   The retailer declined to list specific sites, but said cities to
get stores include Simi Valley, Ventura, Ontario, Riverside, Rancho
Santa Margarita, Temecula and Corona. A company spokeswoman declined
to say whether any stores were planned for Los Angeles County.</LD>
<TE>   To support the stores, Kohl's plans next month to open a
651,000-square-foot distribution center at the former Norton Air
Force Base in San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   The store sites are consistent with the suburban format adopted by
Kohl's, which as of October operated 457 stores in 33 states. Most of
the company's stores are in areas outside major metropolitan areas,
often in smaller strip centers, rather than large shopping malls,
with central parking right in the front of the store.</TE>
<TE>   "It is, we feel, a very significant expansion," said Kohl's
spokeswoman Susan Henderson. "This represents us becoming a national
retailer having a coast-to-coast presence."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Kohl's, which made the announcement before the market
closed, rose 75 cents to $61.06 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Although the chain has been growing quickly and plans to open 80
stores across the country in 2003, its Western expansion had gone
only as far as Denver.</TE>
<TE>   But with an Inland Empire distribution center and a Southern
California beachhead, Kohl's is gearing up for more stores and
already has announced plans for moves into the Phoenix and Las Vegas
areas.</TE>
<TE>   Kohl's has flourished as a hybrid of a department store and a
discounter, offering upscale brands with mass merchant touches --
such as front parking lots, shopping carts and a central bank of
checkout stands.</TE>
<TE>   For the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2001, Kohl's reported its sixth
consecutive year of earnings growth in excess of 30%. Net income for
the year rose 33% to $496 million from $372 million the year before.</TE>

<HD>MaguirePartners Angles to Go Public</HD>
<DH>The developer plans to raise $890 million to fund future
acquisitions and operate as a REIT</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Roger Vincent</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert F. Maguire doesn't know the meaning of small.</LD>
<LD>   The 73-story Library Tower in downtown Los Angeles, part of his
company's $2-billion real estate portfolio, is the tallest building
in the West. The Playa Vista project was among the biggest planned
communities in Los Angeles County when Maguire spearheaded it in the
late 1980s.</LD>
<LD>   And on Tuesday, MaguirePartners filed for the real estate
industry's biggest initial public stock offering in five years. The
$890-million IPO, set for January, is designed to help fund future
acquisitions and development.</LD>
<TE>   Maguire Properties Inc., a new company to be formed by a series of
complex refinancing and acquisition deals, would operate as a real
estate investment trust, according to a Securities and Exchange
Commission filing Tuesday. Maguire would wind up with 20.5% of the
company's stock.</TE>
<TE>   A REIT allows small investors to participate in large real estate
ventures. Unlike other public companies, REITs must distribute 95% of
their income to shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed stock sale comes at a time when the commercial real
estate market has been slowing and investors are more skeptical of
publicly traded real estate firms.</TE>
<TE>   "Premier office REITs currently trade at prices that are lower
than their net assets, which tells you something about how public
investors feel about the current state of the office market -- not
good," said James Sullivan, an analyst at Green Street Advisors, an
independent real estate securities research firm in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   But Maguire and his partners, the largest office landlords in
downtown Los Angeles, have some things working in their favor. They
have "a portfolio of very, very high quality assets" and a "strong
track record of creating value," Sullivan said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the 23 office buildings owned by MaguirePartners are the
landmark Gas Co. Tower and Wells Fargo Center in downtown Los
Angeles. It also owns two hotels and 20 parking garages. Rounding out
the portfolio, which spans 12 million square feet of space in all,
are a few properties in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.</TE>
<TE>   Maguire is a major player in L.A. civic and philanthropic affairs.
While he is often charming, the 67-year-old Maguire also can be
abrupt and profane -- traits not always conducive to leadership of a
public company.</TE>
<TE>   "It remains to be seen if he has the personality required to be
tolerant of analysts and shareholders who might question his
decision-making," Sullivan said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps in an effort to assuage such concerns, Maguire has named
attorney Richard I. Gilchrist co-chief executive and president of the
new company. Gilchrist, 52, was a senior partner with Maguire from
1982 to 1995, when he left to co-found Commonwealth Partners, a Los
Angeles-based property management and development firm. Gilchrist
went on to serve as CEO and president of Commonwealth Atlantic, a
privately held REIT, before returning in February to work with
Maguire as a consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Maguire and his representatives declined to comment on the filing,
citing SEC rules. The filing didn't say how many sharesMaguire
Properties planned to sell to the investing public. The offering will
be handled by Credit Suisse First Boston and Salomon Smith Barney.</TE>
<TE>   A series of refinancings and other transactions tied to the IPO
would give the portfolio a $10.2-million profit through the six
months ended June 30, contrasted with a $12.9-million loss before the
restructuring, according to the SEC filing. At the same time, the
filing notes that there are considerable risks for would-be
investors. Among them: "We have not obtained recent appraisals of the
properties in connection with this offering, and the consideration
paid for them may exceed their fair-market value."</TE>
<TE>   In all, Maguire has developed 30 million square feet over the last
20 years. His firm, formerly known as Maguire Thomas Partners, was
one of the largest developers in the Los Angeles region and the U.S.
in the late 1980s, before the real estate recession of the early
1990s. He and his longtime partner, James Thomas, split in 1996 after
rents and values in downtown Los Angeles collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of Maguire's efforts have been winners. He lost control of
the massive Playa Vista commercial and residential development near
Westchester in 1997 amid financial problems and a feud with
DreamWorks SKG, which was going to be the lead tenant before it
backed out. A group of investment banks led by Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Morgan Stanley took control, leaving Maguire with a tiny
stake and the right to develop some commercial space.</TE>
<TE>   But it didn't take Maguire long to bounce back. He waited out the
recession and began reclaiming sole ownership of a series of
properties in which he had sold a partial interest.</TE>
<TE>   The initial public offering unveiled Tuesday would be the biggest
for an office REIT since Boston Properties Inc. raised $903 million
in June 1997, according to the National Assn. of Real Estate
Investment Trusts.</TE>
<TE>   Maguire has been trying to raise funds for more than a year.
Negotiations to sell a majority stake in his properties to TrizecHahn
Corp. ended in late 2001 after the market suffered in the wake of the
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the IPO will succeed, and allow Maguire to realize his
ambitions, remains to be seen. Market volatility, said David Menlow,
president of New Jersey-based Ipofinancial.com, "will be a permanent
part of the landscape for a while."</TE>

<HD>'Spider-Man' Creator Sues Marvel Over Profits</HD>
<DH>Stan Lee says he has not shared in the 'jackpot' success of
the summer hit movie or other films and television shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stan Lee, the creative force behind such comic superheroes as
"Spider-Man" and the "Incredible Hulk," filed a $10-million lawsuit
Tuesday, alleging that his old comic book company cheated him out of
millions of dollars in movie profits.</LD>
<LD>   The 80-year-old writer, whose Stan Lee Media Inc. is based in
Encino, contends that Marvel Enterprises Inc. reneged on a promise to
pay him 10% of the profits from movies and television shows based on
his characters. Marvel has tried to shut him out of the "jackpot"
success of this summer's "Spider-Man" movie, he said.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit was filed in New York federal court.</LD>
<TE>   In 1939, Lee started work as an errand boy for Marvel's
predecessor, a company identified in the complaint as Timely. He
wrote his first comic book in 1941 and eventually rose to
editor-in-chief and publisher.</TE>
<TE>   During those years, Lee teamed with a group of artists to create
some of Marvel Comics' most famous superheroes, which also include
the Fantastic Four and X-Men.</TE>
<TE>   Marvel executives "have personally realized enormous windfalls
from the X-Men and Spider-Man films and their ancillary merchandise,"
Lee said, but has "refused to share any of this good fortune" with
him.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite reaping enormous benefits from Mr. Lee's creations,
defendants have failed and refused to honor their commitments to
him," the lawsuit claims.</TE>
<TE>   The "Spider-Man" movie generated about $800 million in worldwide
box office sales by August and was projected to reach $850 million
this year.</TE>
<TE>   The film, which stars Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Willem
Dafoe, was released in May by Sony Corp.'s Columbia Pictures. But Lee
said he hasn't seen a penny.</TE>
<TE>   Marvel receives part of the gross receipts from the film and
licensing revenue from toys and other related items. Its earnings got
a $12.8-million boost in the second-quarter from the film.</TE>
<TE>   But while Marvel has reported millions of dollars in earnings from
the film, it has told Lee the company has seen no "profits" as
defined by their contract.</TE>
<TE>   Lee hopes a judge will intervene and make sure he gets a
percentage of profit from the Ben Affleck movie "Daredevil,"
scheduled for February release.</TE>
<TE>   He also seeks a share of profit from the upcoming movie "The
Hulk," and the sequels to "X-Men" and "Spider-Man."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit demands damages and a court order forcing Marvel to
turn over Lee's share in any profits from movies about characters he
created.</TE>
<TE>   The publisher said in a statement Tuesday that Lee is "well
compensated" and that the company "believes it is in full compliance
with and current on all payments due under the terms of Mr. Lee's
employment agreement."</TE>
<TE>   Marvel shares rose 6 cents to $8.11 on the New York Stock
Exchange. They've gained more than 113% this year.</TE>

<HD>SEC May Sue Northrop on Disclosures to Shareholders</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Pae</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission may file a civil lawsuit
against Northrop Grumman Corp. for failing to give shareholders
updated information about its failed merger in 1998 with Lockheed
Martin Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC, in a Sept. 27 letter, told Los Angeles-based Northrop
that it was considering recommending that "civil injunctive
proceedings" be initiated, alleging that the defense contractor
failed to be more forthcoming with investors about the proposed
Lockheed merger.</LD>
<LD>   The merger, which would have been the largest in the defense
industry at the time, was abandoned after the Justice Department
raised antitrust concerns.</LD>
<TE>   Officials at Northrop first disclosed the SEC letter in a
regulatory filing last month. Northrop also disclosed the letter
Tuesday in its quarterly report.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop said the charges appear similar to those in several civil
lawsuits brought against it by shareholders shortly after the merger
collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   The shareholder suits alleged that Northrop failed to provide the
latest information on the status of the antitrust investigation
before it rejected the merger. The lawsuits in federal court
eventually were dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is old news," said Bob Bishop, a Northrop spokesman. "Seven
judges have reviewed this matter and have dismissed it."</TE>
<TE>   SEC officials could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop's stock closed Tuesday at $97.28, down 12 cents, on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Energy Probe Focuses on Rigging</HD>
<DH>Recent subpoenas to major state players suggest grand jury
is trying to determine whether firms colluded to withhold power or
game the system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal grand jury investigating California's energy crisis appears
to be focusing on whether major electricity suppliers worked together
to rig the energy market.</LD>
<LD>   Grand juries operate in secret and its members and attorneys are
forbidden by law from revealing facts about deliberations and
investigations. But subpoenas issued during the last few days to
major players in the state's electricity markets suggest the San
Francisco-based grand jury is trying to determine whether companies
colluded to intentionally withhold power or otherwise game the
system. That could be a violation of federal antitrust laws.</LD>
<LD>   Dynegy Inc. of Houston and Southern Co. of Atlanta on Tuesday were
the latest to acknowledge they have received subpoenas from the U.S.
attorney for the Northern District of California requesting
information related to their operations in California. At least five
other companies have received similar subpoenas from the office of
U.S. Atty. Kevin V. Ryan since Friday, including AES Corp., Duke
Energy Corp., Mirant Corp., Reliant Resources Inc. and Williams Cos.</LD>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Matthew J. Jacobs refused to say Tuesday what
information federal prosecutors are seeking, adding only: "We are
investigating pricing in the California energy markets." The San
Francisco offices of the U.S. attorney and the FBI are conducting the
investigation for the grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   None of the companies that received the lengthy subpoenas would
detail exactly what was demanded, but the broadest outlines began to
emerge Tuesday through public statements and regulatory filings by
the targeted companies.</TE>
<TE>   The subpoenas seek records of the companies' power-plant
operations and electricity sales in California back to January 1998,
shortly before the state began its ill-fated experiment with
deregulation. In addition, the subpoenas ask the companies about
contact with other electricity generators or power traders.</TE>
<TE>   Williams Chief Executive Steve Malcolm said Monday that the
subpoena, which the Tulsa, Okla.-based company received Friday,
contained several questions and sought documents related "to a
federal antitrust investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Williams and all of the companies subpoenaed promised to cooperate
with the probe and denied any wrongdoing during California's energy
crisis of 2000-01, which brought record electricity prices and
chronic power shortages, pushing the state's two biggest electricity
utilities into insolvency.</TE>
<TE>   The question of whether power-plant owners and energy traders
conspired to raise prices either through withholding power or
questionable trading has surfaced before in various investigations
looking for causes and culprits. These include a state legislative
committee headed by Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer and the
California Public Utilities Commission.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. Atty. Ryan's swift-moving investigation is being aided by
the unique insights of Timothy N. Belden, the top Western trader for
Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Belden is believed to have been the mastermind behind Enron's
questionable trading tactics. After admitting to a series of schemes
to defraud California electricity customers during the energy crisis,
Belden pleaded guilty Oct. 17 to a single count of conspiracy to
commit wire fraud, agreed to forfeit $2.1 million in "criminally
derived" compensation from Enron and promised to cooperate with
federal investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Belden's cooperation is considered crucial because, as the head of
the California energy trading operation of what was once the world's
largest energy trader, he was ideally positioned to see what was
going on in the market. Internal Enron memos note that the company's
traders dreamed up colorful nicknames so that they could more easily
communicate about the trading ploys with brokers from other
companies.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like what's happening now is they have uncovered much
more illegal activity related to price-fixing," said Michael Aguirre,
a San Diego attorney who has filed two lawsuits against generators
and traders that did business in California.</TE>
<TE>   The only other subpoena for the San Francisco grand jury to be
made public was in August to the California Independent System
Operator, which operates the transmission grid for most of the state.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Directors of the family-owned media company that owns the Orange
County Register will meet in January to consider options to raise
money for shareholders, including selling all or part of the company.
The Freedom Communications Inc. board of directors met Tuesday to
discuss a report prepared on behalf of fourth-generation descendants
of R.C. Hoiles, who founded the company in the 1930s.</LD>
<LD>   The youngest members of the family are working on a plan to allow
other family members to sell shares in the privately held company.
Some older members have been disappointed in the company's
performance and its effect on their holdings in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   The report, prepared by Merrill Lynch, outlined options for the
younger generation to buy shares from older members who are looking
for cash, Freedom Chief Executive Alan Bell said. The Irvine-based
company is one of the last family-owned media companies in the
country. It owns 28 daily newspapers, 37 weeklies and eight
television stations, including the flagship Register.</LD>

<LD>The federal government said it had no plans to regulate the

for struggling air carriers that have invested heavily in Web-based
marketing strategies.</LD>
<LD>   The Transportation Department's decision is a big victory for
online travel service Orbitz Inc., which is owned by five major
airlines.</LD>
<LD>   The growing use of the Internet in recent years to market fares

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Veritas Software Corp., a maker of computer data-storage software,
named Edwin Gillis as chief financial officer. His predecessor
admitted lying about a master's degree and quit last month.</LD>
<LD>   Gillis, 53, was CFO at Parametric Technology Corp. since 1995 and
held the same title at Lotus Development Corp. A certified public
accountant, he worked 15 years at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, where he managed
the firm's software industry group.</LD>
<LD>   The new finance chief replaces Kenneth Lonchar, who resigned Oct.
3 after telling Veritas that he had lied about having a master's
degree in business administration from Stanford University. He later
quit as a director of Fort Lauderdale-based software maker Citrix
Systems Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Veritas and competitors such as EMC Corp. face slow demand as
companies cut computer-related budgets. Veritas Chief Executive Gary
Bloom said last month that he didn't expect spending to increase
until the second half of next year.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Mountain View, Calif.-based Veritas rose 82 cents to
$16.77 on Nasdaq. They have fallen 63% this year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. plans to almost double North American sales
to 600,000 by 2007, betting that the world's biggest auto market will
make up for a drop in Japan.</LD>
<LD>   Japan's No. 4 automaker expects sales of cars and light trucks to
increase from last year's 322,393, said Pierre Gagnon, Mitsubishi's
North American chief executive. Mitsubishi, 37%-owned by
DaimlerChrysler, will push further into Mexico and Canada, where it
began selling cars in September.</LD>
<LD>   Tokyo-based Mitsubishi's U.S. sales rose 11% to 284,742 in the
first 10 months of 2002 from a year earlier, and the company expects
the year-end total to reach about 350,000. By contrast, sales in
Japan fell in October for the 27th month in a row, bringing the
decline in sales of cars and light trucks there to 28% through
October.</LD>

<HD>Pressure on Tenet Chief to Resign</HD>
<DH>Jeffrey Barbakow is increasingly getting the blame for the
hospital chain's troubles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald D. White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeffrey C. Barbakow, the chief executive who led Tenet Healthcare
Corp. back from the brink of disaster nine years ago, is facing
increasing blame for the company's current woes and mounting pressure
to resign.</LD>
<LD>   Sheryl Skolnick, an analyst at Fulcrum Global Partners in New
York, said Tuesday that Barbakow's chances of remaining as chairman
and CEO were "problematic" in the wake of disclosures about a
government audit of Tenet's Medicare billings and a separate federal
investigation of heart surgeries at its hospital in Redding.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't see how he regains the trust of investors," Skolnick
said. "I think it has gone too far."</LD>
<TE>   One institutional shareholder, Colorado-based Marsico Capital
Management, last week sold all of its more than 17 million shares of
Tenet stock -- about a 0.3% stake in the company -- after news of the
Medicare billing issues arose.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors need to know that they can trust the institutions they
are involved in," CEO Thomas Marsico said Tuesday in an interview. He
said that reinvestment in Tenet later would depend on a number of
factors, including "a total change in the management team."</TE>
<TE>   Tenet spokesman Harry Anderson said Tuesday that rumors that
Barbakow was going to resign were "absolutely false," adding that the
CEO was working hard to produce a more reliable, longer-term profit
outlook based on less aggressive Medicare billing practices.</TE>
<TE>   Just a few weeks ago, Santa Barbara-based Tenet, the nation's
second-largest hospital chain, was one of the stars of the
health-care business. But that was before word surfaced of the
Medicare audit and the inquiry in Redding, where two doctors are
suspected of performing numerous unnecessary heart operations.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet also is getting questions from investors about the sudden
resignation last week of its chief operating officer and chief
financial officer, as well as what they say was a lack of prompt
public disclosure of the Medicare situation and the Redding inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   The company's stock has plunged by two-thirds in the last two
weeks, erasing $15 billion in equity. It closed Tuesday at $14.98, up
98 cents on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say Tenet and Barbakow face a crisis of confidence
exceeded only by the dark days of 1992 and 1993, when the firm, then
known as National Medical Enterprises, was shaken by a series of
fraud scandals. Some say they aren't sure whom to trust or what to
believe when it comes to Tenet -- and they say Barbakow must share
the blame for that.</TE>
<TE>   Central to Tenet's Medicare billing problems are so-called outlier
payments. These are collected from Medicare, in addition to fixed
reimbursements, to help hospitals defray expenses for unusually
costly treatments such as cardiac procedures. Tenet reported that its
hospitals collected $763 million in such payments last year.</TE>
<TE>   Barbakow has said he was unaware of the extent of Tenet's use of
the Medicare billing program. But that has not allayed the concerns
of many shareholders, analysts and other observers who are asking: If
Barbakow didn't know, why didn't he? And if he did know, why didn't
he address it?</TE>
<TE>   "He looks bad in either scenario," said analyst Frank Morgan of
Jefferies &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   But Morgan also said Barbakow could weather the storm if he
quickly delivers sound and persuasive earnings projections.Another
factor in Barbakow's favor, Morgan added, was his role in turning
Tenet around. after he was brought in as CEO in June 1993.</TE>
<TE>   The firm settled federal fraud charges in its psychiatric hospital
division in the mid-1990s. As part of the settlement, Tenet agreed to
develop an ethics program. Since then, Barbakow has led a major
expansion of the hospital chain, pushed tough negotiations with
health insurers to raise payments and tightened up bill collections.</TE>
<TE>   Barbakow earned $4.5 million in salary and bonus last year -- four
times that of the CEO of HCA Inc., the nation's largest hospital
chain.</TE>
<TE>   Before joining Tenet, Barbakow was a top Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets investment banker in Los Angeles who was tapped in 1988 at
age 44 by billionaire Kirk Kerkorian to run movie studio MGM/UA. One
of his areas of expertise at Merrill Lynch had been developing
partnerships to invest in films.</TE>
<TE>   Barbakow was close to Kerkorian, later serving as a director of
his MGM Grand hotel and casino company.</TE>
<TE>   During his brief tenure in Hollywood, Barbakow was known more as a
financial executive than a creative one. Still, the company's "Rain
Man" captured the Academy Award for best picture under Barbakow's
regime.</TE>
<TE>   Barbakow became a familiar figure in Hollywood circles, investing
in the trendy Maple Drive restaurant when it opened in 1989, along
with such partners as the late actor Dudley Moore and producer Tony
Bill. At Maple Drive, he was given the ultimate honor a restaurant
can bestow on a celebrity when it named a dish after him: the
"Barbakowed Duck Salad."</TE>
<TE>   Barbakow helped engineer the ill-fated $1.3-billion sale of MGM in
1990 to Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, reportedly receiving
$20 million as part of the deal. Parretti had the studio seized from
him within a year by French bank Credit Lyonnais when he defaulted on
his loans. Kerkorian bought the studio back in 1996 from Credit
Lyonnais and still owns it.</TE>
<TE>   After MGM, Barbakow returned to investment banking at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, eventually joining the board of National Medical
Enterprises as an outside director.</TE>
<TE>   Fulcrum's Skolnick said she has met with Tenet investors, who have
expressed disbelief and outrage over the latest revelations. But she
added that there are others who seem neither shocked nor angry.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people are, sad to say, almost expecting this these days,"
she said. "It's a depressing commentary on the quality of corporate
management."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer James Bates contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Top CEOs Expect Sour 2003 U.S. Economy</HD>
<DH>Sales are expected to rise, but many companies plan to cut
jobs and capital spending, says a Business Roundtable survey.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Liz Enochs</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major U.S. companies say they'll eliminate jobs next year and hold
spending on new equipment flat with this year's levels because they
expect the economy to be anemic, according to a survey released
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Almost two-thirds of the chief executives surveyed by the Business
Roundtable in New York forecast that real gross domestic product will
increase less than 2% in 2003, well below the average annual growth
rate of 3.2% over the last decade.</LD>
<LD>   "Our nation's economic recovery has not been strong or sustained,
and the Business Roundtable's survey shows that CEOs do not expect
the situation will improve significantly in 2003," said John Dillon,
chief executive of International Paper Co. and chairman of the
Business Roundtable.</LD>
<TE>   The survey will be used as ammunition in the group's efforts to
shape economic policy in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The Business Roundtable includes CEOs of corporations with a
combined $3.7 trillion in revenue and a total work force of more than
10 million.</TE>
<TE>   About 120 of the Roundtable's 150 members responded to the survey,
Dillon said.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty percent of the chief executives surveyed say they expect to
cut jobs next year, 28% plan to hold their work force steady and 11%
said they will add workers.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the few levers that are available to business today is to
continue to cut employment and downsize to match the incoming order
rates," Dillon said. "Demand for our products continues to be weak."</TE>
<TE>   Fifty-seven percent said they will spend in 2003 the same amount
on new machinery, software and other equipment as they will this
year. Almost one in four plan to reduce capital spending, the survey
found.</TE>
<TE>   "Our companies are in the business of creating jobs and
contributing to economic growth, but we have grave concerns about our
ability to do these things in this fragile economic environment,"
Dillon said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet 71% of the CEOs said they expect sales to rise next year,
while 19% said sales will be little changed and 9% said they expect
sales to fall.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if we get an increase in sales, there's very little ability
to raise prices," Dillon said.</TE>
<TE>   The group will probably ask lawmakers to take new measures to
stimulate the economy, said Dillon in a conference call. "We will be
sharing these results with the White House and Congress," he said.
"We want to be sure they have enough information to help guide their
economic policy agenda to restore consumer confidence and spur
business spending."</TE>
<TE>   Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill took issue with some of the
survey's findings. The U.S. doesn't need an economy-wide program of
tax cuts and more government spending to boost growth because
weakness is confined to some parts of the economy, O'Neill said at a
Fortune magazine-sponsored forum Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The economy has grown at an average 3% annual rate during the
first three quarters of this year. "I wonder what it is that causes
this mood at the moment that we're going down?" said O'Neill. "The
objective data don't seem to support the idea that we're going down."</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, speeches by several Federal Reserve policymakers
indicated that the central bank believes the economy is on course for
a gradual recovery and business investment may be strengthening.</TE>
<TE>   A half-point reduction last week in the Fed's benchmark short-term
interest rate, to 1.25%, will help the economy grow between 3% and 4%
in 2003, said Anthony Santomero, president of the Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia, in a speech in Delaware.</TE>
<TE>   "There is some softness at present, but recent monetary policy
action should prove to be effective in returning the economic
recovery to a more acceptable pace," said Santomero, a voting member
of the Fed's policymaking committee.</TE>
<TE>   He said the uncertainties weighing on the economy will be resolved
and he expects to see "solid, if unspectacular growth" in consumer
spending in line with growth in household incomes.</TE>
<TE>   Reuters was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<LD>In its highflying days, Enron Corp. sought to guide the new Bush
administration toward a sweeping energy agenda, ranging from creating
a national electricity grid to opposing protection of domestic steel
products, according to documents made public Tuesday by congressional
investigators.</LD>
<LD>   Memos released during an oversight hearing by the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee show that in 2001 Enron lobbied the
White House for the appointment of two top energy regulators and
fretted that the Bush administration was losing the energy policy
battle to Democratic critics.</LD>
<LD>   "The Democrats so far seem to be winning the political high
ground," said an Enron briefing paper for Kenneth L. Lay, the
company's chairman, in advance of an April 17, 2001, meeting with
Vice President Dick Cheney. "What the Bush team needs to do is steal
a page from the Clinton new economy playbook and to relegate the
Democrats to the Carter 'eat your peas' playbook."</LD>
<TE>   The White House must link the Democrats to "blackouts, waste,
Luddites, regulation, government ownership, stagnation" while
positioning Bush as the agent of "abundan[ce], efficiency, new
economy, innovation, open markets," the document said.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats said the documents showed how Enron wielded its clout --
by, among other things, backing specific nominees to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission and meeting with high administration
officials on energy policy -- before collapsing into bankruptcy
protection in December in a wave of accounting scandals. Republicans
pointed out that Enron also enjoyed access to high-level appointees
in Bill Clinton's administration.</TE>
<TE>   The documents provide a glimpse at the behind-the-scenes
maneuvering on major policy debates.</TE>
<TE>   Lay, now a pariah in business and political circles, was then on a
first-name basis with powerful administration figures.</TE>
<TE>   "Congratulations on the speed with which you, Dick and others have
been able to place high-quality individuals in every cabinet post,"
he faxed Bush transition team director Clay Johnson on Jan. 8, 2001,
after Bush's cabinet picks had been announced. The "Dick" referred to
was Cheney, and Lay signed his note "Ken."</TE>
<TE>   Enron's efforts, however, did not always lead to the desired
results.</TE>
<TE>   Its two candidates for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission --
Patrick H. Wood III and Nora Brownell -- were approved, despite some
strong competition. But in the summer of 2001, Wood and Brownell
voted for energy price limits in the West, a policy opposed by Enron.
Wood is now FERC chairman.</TE>
<TE>   While limits on soaring prices in the West took up much public
debate during 2001, the documents show that Enron focused on an
insider's issue: the creation of a national electricity transmission
grid. It coined an egalitarian term for the issue: "open access."</TE>
<TE>   A national grid would have radically shifted the fortunes of some
of the biggest players in the electricity industry. Old-fashioned
utility companies that still control much of the regional
transmission infrastructure would have seen their influence diminish,
while the new breed of energy marketers epitomized by Enron would
have seen their ascendancy confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   To Enron's chagrin, administration officials were treading
cautiously.</TE>
<TE>   "For the purposes of this meeting, we strongly recommend that most
of the discussion center on our core concern: open access," Enron's
Washington lobbyists wrote Lay before his meeting with Cheney.</TE>
<TE>   The company also retained Ed Gillespie, a top GOP political and
policy consultant, to lobby the White House.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not clear that [administration officials] are fully
committed to our open access issues," Enron lobbyist Linda Robertson
wrote Lay. "Their lack of zeal for open access, while totally
unacceptable, is understandable given that the West Coast power
crisis has presented the administration with difficult and unique
political issues."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Bush's energy plan did endorse the concept of a
national grid but left it to FERC and Congress to work out the
details.</TE>
<TE>   FERC, an independent agency that functions like a national
utilities commission, has since unveiled a proposal for such a grid.
But it has been sharply criticized by elected officials, state
regulators and utilities in the West and the South, and it appears
far from becoming official policy.</TE>
<TE>   The documents show that in the spring of 2001, Enron's lobbyists
correctly forecast that the administration would eventually accept
price limits on electricity in the West.</TE>
<TE>   White House energy advisor Andrew Lundquist "stated he is getting
pressure from both Democrat and Republican members of Congress about
price caps in the West," Enron's Washington lobbyists reported to
Lay. This was interpreted as "a warning that price caps might be
inevitable."</TE>
<TE>   Although opposed to price caps, Enron believed that a more visible
role for federal regulators might calm public concerns and allow for
more far-reaching changes in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   "More aggressive action by the FERC on both market power issues
and pricing issues would give the administration enormous political
cover and would allow them to redefine the debate," the Enron
lobbyists wrote.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials have said that though they consulted with
Enron, the company received no special favors.</TE>

<HD>Banks Raising Credit Standards for Businesses</HD>
<DH>A Federal Reserve poll shows a tightening of terms for
commercial and industrial loans, partially offsetting the recent
interest rate cut.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Federal Reserve on Tuesday said banks made businesses meet
stricter credit standards and terms for bank loans in recent months,
a move that partially offsets the central bank's recent interest-rate
cut.</LD>
<LD>   "The results indicate some further tightening of standards and
terms for commercial and industrial [C&amp;I] loans over the past three
months," the Fed said in summarizing the results of its latest survey
of banks' senior loan officers.</LD>
<LD>   The poll is conducted about four times a year and asks about
changes in bank credit availability to businesses and households. The
survey included responses from 55 large U.S. banks and 20 branches of
large foreign banks.</LD>
<TE>   The demand for C&amp;I loans and commercial real estate loans weakened
between the newest poll and the one released in August, the Fed said.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed cut short-term interest rates last week to help give the
lackluster economy a shot in the arm, but many economists say lower
rates may help little as long as demand for credit remains slack.</TE>
<TE>   In special questions asked only for the most recent poll, the Fed
asked why C&amp;I loan volume had fallen, noting one measure of
commercial and industrial loans had seen an annual rate of decline of
more than 7% in the first nine months of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "According to domestic respondents, the most important reason for
the [decrease] in C&amp;I loans is the reduced funding needs of
credit-worthy borrowers; indeed, almost three-fourths of domestic
banks identified this factor as being 'most important,' " the Fed
said.</TE>
<TE>   But the central bank also noted that the U.S. banks said their
tightening of standards over the last nine months had contributed to
the smaller number of firms being identified as credit-worthy.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign banks, however, were less likely to say the decline in
credit-worthy borrowers was due only to more stringent standards.</TE>
<TE>   The survey lends some support to recent complaints from a
Washington-based lobbying group that banks are being too tough on
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "Some banks have gone so far as to put lending to the entire
manufacturing sector off limits. Some are reducing the appraised
value of machinery and equipment, reducing the borrower's collateral
base, and still others are raising loan fees [so] high that any
advantage of the Fed's reduction of interest rates is erased," said
Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Assn. of Manufacturers,
last week.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed cut rates by a larger-than-expected half-percentage point,
but then said the risks to the economy were balanced between slow
growth and inflation, a signal it was unlikely to cut rates again
soon.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed said U.S. banks reported "largely unchanged" standards on
home mortgages and consumer loans, while demand for consumer credit
was reported to be unchanged since the last survey.</TE>
<TE>   Almost half of U.S. banks polled said between 20% and 40% of
customers who had refinanced their mortgages had engaged in
"cash-out" transactions. In those refinancings, the borrower is able
to turn the rise in their homes' value into cash, supporting
household spending.</TE>

<HD>Profit Warning Clips Early Gains</HD>
<DH>Philip Morris pulls back from its 2003 forecast, and its
shares drop 14%, weighing on the Dow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street ended its three-day losing streak Tuesday, but stocks
pared early gains after a late-afternoon profit warning from
cigarette maker Philip Morris tempered investors' optimism.</LD>
<LD>   Before the announcement from Dow component Philip Morris, the
three major U.S. stock indexes were rallying strongly, buoyed by rosy
outlooks from tech and telecom bellwethers such as Oracle and Cisco
Systems and positive comments on a U.S. economic recovery from
Federal Reserve officials.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 27.05 points, or 0.3%,
to 8,386 after failing to hold an earlier 145-point advance. The
broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index gained 6.76 points, or 0.8%, to
882.95, and the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index rose 30.37
points, or 2.3%, to 1,349.56. The gains ended the market's recent
string of losses, which has raised fears that Wall Street's autumn
rally was losing steam.</LD>
<TE>   Winners outnumbered losers by 3 to 2 on Nasdaq and the New York
Stock Exchange in moderate trading.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Philip Morris weighed heavily on the Dow, plunging
$5.95, or 14%, to $37.03. The company, which was the most active on
the NYSE, said it couldn't confirm its 2003 forecast because of soft
domestic tobacco industry volume. The company cited an influx of
cheap imported cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   Following the warning, the S&amp;P tobacco index slumped more than
13%, making it the worst-performing S&amp;P 500 industry group.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the market's late-session swoon was a news report that
terrorist leader Osama bin Laden praised recent attacks in Yemen,
Bali and Moscow in an audiotape received by Al Jazeera, a Middle East
satellite television station.</TE>
<TE>   The Bin Laden report, which comes as the U.S. prepares for a
possible attack on Iraq, "is bringing all the terrorism concerns back
to light," said Tom Schrader, head of listed trading at Legg Mason
Wood Walker.</TE>
<TE>   The news helped offset comments from Fed officials Tuesday
downplaying worries about the future of the U.S. economy and setting
an upbeat tone economists expect Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan to echo today in remarks to Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "The pieces are in place to engender a gradual strengthening in
economic activity in coming quarters," Fed Vice Chairman Roger
Ferguson said in a speech at Carnegie Mellon University. Three other
Fed officials joined him in suggesting that the central bank's
interest rate cut last week was all the economy would need to
accelerate from a current "soft spot."</TE>
<TE>   In commodities trading, gold prices rose to the highest levels in
almost six weeks, but oil prices held steady even though Iraq's
parliament rejected the U.N. disarmament plan, raising prospects that
Baghdad would balk at inspections and invite a U.S.-led war.</TE>
<TE>   Gold rose $3.30 to $324.50 an ounce in New York trading, its
highest since Oct 3. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil fell 4
cents to $25.90 a barrel, barely a dollar above 19-week lows struck
earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar, meanwhile, was mixed, slipping against the euro and
rising against the Japanese yen.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Cisco rose 71 cents to $12.87 after the company said backlog
orders were up from September. Analysts use the data to gauge future
sales. The SOX index of semiconductor stocks jumped 4% on Cisco's
data, making it the best-performing S&amp;P 500 industry group.</TE>
<TE>   * Oracle rose 45 cents to $9.50 after Chief Financial Officer Jeff
Henley said he sees a turnaround for the technology industry next
year, forecasting a return to growth in 2003 for Oracle after two
years of revenue declines.</TE>
<TE>   * Motorola, the No. 2 maker of wireless phones, rose 37 cents to
$8.75 after saying Monday it still plans to meet earlier
fourth-quarter financial forecasts, good news for some investors who
have been worried about a slow spending environment.</TE>

<HD>Judge Rules Against Wine Ban</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It's unconstitutional for New York state to ban direct-to-customer
shipments of wine from out-of-state producers, while allowing such
sales by in-state wineries, a federal judge concluded Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The law at issue in the case required vintners outside New York,
such as California wineries, to use state-authorized wholesalers.
Several out-of-state wineries sued, calling the law discriminatory.</LD>
<LD>   The issue of direct wine shipments across state lines is gaining
steam. Last week, President Bush signed into law a provision backed
by California's wineries allowing wine purchased by winery visitors
to be shipped to their home states even if those states prohibit
direct shipments of alcohol.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Richard Berman ruled that New York's ban is
discriminatory.</TE>
<TE>   His ruling followed the lead of courts in Texas, Illinois,
Virginia and North Carolina that have blocked similar statutes. Other
courts, including a federal appeals court in Chicago, have upheld
state bans on direct wine shipments.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said he was persuaded by evidence "that the direct
shipping ban was designed to protect New York state businesses from
out-of-state competition."</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs called the practice "economic protectionism."</TE>
<TE>   Berman left unresolved whether all vintners, including those based
in New York and other states, would be allowed to ship directly -- or
whether none would be. He asked to hear additional arguments in the
case.</TE>
<TE>   Industry officials were watching the case because 26 states
restrict the direct sale of wine, and New York is the second-largest
wine-consuming state after California.</TE>
<TE>   The American Vintners Assn., which represents about 600 of the
nation's 1,600 mostly small wine producers, has said wineries have
long sought the repeal of the restrictive Depression-era laws.</TE>
<TE>   A California winemaker joined three New York consumers in alleging
that the state law ran afoul of the U.S. Constitution's commerce
clause.</TE>

<HD>U.S. May Seek Longer Sentence for Waksal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal prosecutors plan to ask a judge to lengthen the proposed
prison sentence of ImClone Systems Inc. founder Samuel D. Waksal, who
pleaded guilty to insider trading and five other crimes, people
familiar with the government's case said.</LD>
<LD>   Waksal is scheduled to be sentenced in January by U.S. District
Judge William Pauley in New York, where U.S. Atty. James Comey will
argue for more than the recommended seven to nine years. Prosecutors
reportedly will produce evidence showing that Waksal is guilty of
seven charges to which he didn't confess, the people said.</LD>
<LD>   Comey's strategy provides him a chance to extend Waksal's
punishment without risking a lengthy court trial, criminal lawyers
said.</LD>
<TE>   A decision by Pauley to increase Waksal's sentence would probably
spur prosecutors to drop the seven remaining charges, people familiar
with the government's tactics said. The unproved charges relate to an
alleged conspiracy Waksal had with his father and a daughter to
commit insider trading.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone shares gained 77 cents to $9.75 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>New Investor Tax Breaks Expected</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Battered stock investors may get some relief from the next Congress,
including a more generous tax break that could make losses from the
current bear market easier to swallow.</LD>
<LD>   Now that the Republicans will control both houses of Congress,
analysts expect three "investor-friendly" tax proposals to be debated
early next year as part of efforts to stimulate the flagging U.S.
economy.</LD>
<LD>   The best odds of success rest with a plan to increase the amount
of capital losses that investors can use to shield other income from
taxes, analysts say. Raising that limit, which has stayed at $3,000 a
year for more than two decades, is seen as having broad appeal to a
populace reeling from the deep, 2 1/2-year bear market in stocks.</LD>
<TE>   "It's reasonable in terms of the revenue drain, and it would be
popular not with the super-rich but with average investors," said
Robert Willens, tax and accounting analyst at Lehman Bros. in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Investors say the plan would help heal bear market wounds.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly it will be welcomed, particularly if they make it
applicable" to losses suffered this year, said Jim Peoples, a
health-care consultant from Agoura Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Of the two other main proposals related to the market, relief from
the so-called double taxation of dividends is seen as a possibility,
but reducing capital gains taxes is considered a longshot because it
will be perceived as elitist by Democrats, who still will hold enough
sway in the Senate to make things difficult for the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats will push for proposals aimed at lower- and
middle-income taxpayers -- perhaps a national monthlong "holiday"
from payroll taxes, for instance -- and will strive to tailor
legislation toward the working class, said Sung Won Sohn, chief
economist at Wells Fargo &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Although some observers say the capital loss limit could be as
much as tripled, to $9,000 a year, Sohn called that "wishful thinking
on Wall Street." He called $4,000 to $5,000 more realistic given the
effect on the federal budget, already in the red.</TE>
<TE>   The limit applies to any losses left over after realized
investment losses are used to offset realized gains from the same
year. Under the current limit, a person who had $10,000 in losses and
$4,000 in gains from stock sales this year could use the losses to
shield the entire $4,000 from capital gains taxes, and use $3,000 of
the remaining losses to shield that much regular income from taxes.
The remaining $3,000 in losses can be carried forward to offset gains
in future years.</TE>
<TE>   The tax on dividend income is often targeted because the money is
taxed twice -- once when it is reported as profit by the company
paying the dividend and again when it is distributed to shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Changing the rules on dividend taxation probably would require a
compromise that appeals to middle-class Americans, analysts said. One
possibility might be to exclude the first several hundred dollars in
dividend income from taxation. Another might be to tax the first
$5,000 to $10,000 in dividends at the lower capital gains rate and
the rest as ordinary income.</TE>
<TE>   Cutting the tax on capital gains, meanwhile, has long been
controversial. The tax rate on regular long-term gains is 20%,
compared with a top rate on regular income of 38.6%. Though
conservatives and "supply-side" economists champion reducing the rate
to stimulate investment, the idea still faces an uphill fight.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the sort of supply-side refrain that is sure to make the
Democrats dig in their heels because they see it as mainly benefiting
the elite," Willens said.</TE>
<TE>   The tax proposals would not affect assets in retirement plans such
as 401(k)s and IRAs, the vehicles used by many Americans to invest in
the stock market. In the $6-trillion mutual fund industry, for
example, 33% of assets are in such tax-advantaged retirement
accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever reforms emerge from the next Congress, they are likely to
benefit the stock market by making equities more attractive to those
who invest through taxable accounts, analysts say. Experts downplayed
the possibility that changes such as raising the capital-loss limit
could depress the market by encouraging investors to dump depreciated
stocks to lock in losses.</TE>

<HD>Jesse Ventura in Talk Show Negotiations</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura appears to be headed to a nightly talk
show for MSNBC when he leaves office in January.</LD>
<LD>   The outspoken governor, who previously was a commentator for NBC's
short-lived XFL football league, is in advanced discussions with the
third-place cable news network to serve as a host, although there is
no final deal, according to people familiar with the situation.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura is a regular guest on MSNBC, which in the last year has
adopted a more opinion-driven format.</LD>
<TE>   He's also a popular one: His recent appearance on the network's
"Hardball" gave the show its largest number of viewers this year.</TE>
<TE>   An MSNBC spokeswoman said the network does not comment on
speculation about programming "until we have something to announce."</TE>
<TE>   A CNN spokeswoman confirmed that the network had met with Ventura
but said it ultimately decided that a talk show wouldn't fit with
CNN's news-driven mission. Other networks have been talking to the
Minnesota governor as well. A spokesman for the governor's office
declined to comment.</TE>

<HD>Canada Central Bank Takes Different Tack on Interest Rates</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bank of Canada distanced itself from its U.S. counterpart
Tuesday, insisting that it still needed to raise interest rates even
as the economy of its largest trading partner enjoys the lowest rates
in a generation.</LD>
<LD>   Senior Deputy Gov. Malcolm Knight, speaking less than a week after
the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by half a percentage
point, said the bank was watching both domestic and international
factors as it weighed how best to trim credit availability in the
fast-growing Canadian economy.</LD>
<LD>   "In order to sustain noninflationary growth, we will need to
continue to remove mon- etary stimulus," Knight told the
Canadian-American Business Council.</LD>
<TE>   "The pace and extent of this action will depend on capacity and
inflation pressures in Canada, and how these pressures are influenced
by domestic and external developments."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in Alberta, Bank of Canada Deputy Gov. Paul Jenkins also
said the central bank may keep raising interest rates if Canada's
economy continues its red-hot pace and inflation pressures rise.</TE>
<TE>   The bank said last month that it assumed core inflation would peak
at 3% by year's end and then subside to 2% in the second half of
2003.</TE>
<TE>   The Bank of Canada has raised interest rates three times this year
-- in April, June and July -- becoming the first of the Group of
Seven industrialized nations' central banks to increase rates since
last year's terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Canada's overnight lending rate is 2.75%, well above the
comparable U.S. federal funds rate, which is 1.25%.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that our economies are quite integrated does not mean
that we also need closely integrated monetary policies, or that
Canada's regime of inflation targeting and a flexible exchange rate
is not needed," Knight said in a speech on the Canadian economy in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Higher interest rates could strengthen the Canadian dollar, giving
Canadians more purchasing power while making the country and its
goods more expensive for Americans and other foreigners.</TE>

<HD>SEC Formalizes Probe at Knight Trading Group</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Knight Trading Group Inc. said Tuesday that the Securities and
Exchange Commission had begun a formal investigation into allegations
of improper trading practices at the largest dealer of Nasdaq stocks.</LD>
<LD>   The Jersey City, N.J.-based firm disclosed in a quarterly report
that the SEC issued a "formal order" for investigation, meaning its
informal inquiry has been upgraded and investigators now have the
authority to subpoena testimony as well as telephone and bank
records.</LD>
<LD>   Regulators with the SEC and the NASD, formerly the National Assn.
of Securities Dealers, have been investigating an allegation by
former Knight executive Robert Stellato that the firm placed its own
orders before customer orders for the same stock, a practice known as
"front-running." Stellato oversaw Knight's trading with money
managers.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to be as transparent as possible," Knight Chief Executive
Tom Joyce said in an interview. The regulators "got the last bit of
information from us two weeks go. They haven't asked for anything
more in the last few weeks. Everything they've asked for they have."</TE>
<TE>   Joyce said last month that the company had hired the "best law
firms" and that a review of trades showed that "no front- running or
trading ahead occurred."</TE>
<TE>   Knight's shares fell 16 cents to $4.62 on Nasdaq. They have fallen
58% this year.</TE>

<HD>Students in Kabul Protest Lack of Food and Power; At Least
1 Killed</HD>
<DH>Some call out anti-government slogans as they hurl rocks at
police and soldiers. Three are arrested at university.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Valerie Reitman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>At least one student was killed and five others injured after a
protest against lack of food and electricity at Afghanistan's leading
institution of higher learning.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first such demonstration against the new government
since the Taliban regime was driven out of Kabul a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   The demonstration erupted at Kabul University on Monday night and
lasted well into Tuesday. It began when hungry students, who had been
fasting until nightfall, as required of Muslims during the holy month
of Ramadan, had to wait three hours in the dark and cold for the
dinner that would break their fast.</LD>
<TE>   Higher education and dormitory accommodations are free to
students, who come from villages throughout Afghanistan. Many,
however, are too poor to buy food and the gas lanterns needed for
light and heat during the frequent power outages. When the power goes
-- as it does for several hours a day -- the water goes as well.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said the number of demonstrators ranged from hundreds to
thousands. They hurled bricks and rocks at police and soldiers, who
ringed the university. Authorities used water cannons and fired guns
into the air. On Tuesday morning, the students tried to march on the
presidential palace but were blocked by police.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it fair to kill someone" for wanting food? asked Mohammed
Ajmal, an engineering student.</TE>
<TE>   President Hamid Karzai said in a statement that at least one
student was killed and five others injured. Unconfirmed reports said
five died and dozens more were injured.</TE>
<TE>   In his statement, Karzai vowed that authorities would go after the
police or soldiers responsible for the killings. Three students were
arrested for sedition, said Mohammed Afdal Aman, Kabul police deputy
garrison commander.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said some of the students had been calling out
anti-government slogans, such as "Down with the government" and "Down
with Ahmed Shah Masoud," the slain hero of the Northern Alliance,
which fought the Taliban. An Afghan reporter said he had heard some
of the student leaders shouting, "Long live Osama bin Laden and
Mullah Omar," the Taliban leader.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no doubt that a few other students wanted to use this
opportunity for sedition and will be investigated," Aman said.</TE>
<TE>   By late Tuesday afternoon, most of the police had left and life
began returning to normal around the university, where the evidence
of Afghanistan's decades of war is everywhere. The walls of the front
buildings are blown out and have yet to be repaired. Ringing the
campus is block upon block of devastated housing, with little left
but pieces of the mud-brick walls.</TE>

<LD>Swaziland's King Mswati III plans to acquire a $51-million luxury
jet, despite opposition in parliament and criticism from aid donors
seeking to stave off starvation in his kingdom.</LD>
<LD>   "The king needs the plane to get food for you," Natural Resources
Minister Magwagwa Mdluli told drought victims at rural Macetjeni last
weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The Canadian-made plane is worth about a quarter of the national
budget in Swaziland, where about 250,000 people, or a quarter of the
population, need food assistance urgently. Britain has said the
purchase might jeopardize European aid.</LD>

<LD>   Aid workers say children and the elderly are already dying from
hunger in the worst-affected area. Many livestock have also died.</LD>

worst industrial dispute of Prime Minister Tony Blair's government.</LD>
<LD>   The strikes -- starting with a 48-hour stoppage tonight -- will
force up to 19,000 British soldiers already stretched by preparations
for possible war with Iraq to take over emergency duties.</LD>
<LD>   The strike call by 50,000 firefighters is the most serious in a
series of ongoing confrontations between various unions and the

and have rejected an offer of 11%.</LD>

<HD>As Their Rulers Huddle, Chinese Are Left Out in the Cold</HD>
<DH>Everyone knows the Communist Party is meeting, but media
reports are vague at best.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Chu and Anthony Kuhn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Communist Party congresses were sometimes so secret in years past
that the Chinese public received no news of them until they were
over.</LD>
<LD>   This week, there's no mistaking that China's ruling party is
holding its 16th National Congress here. Red banners flutter from
buildings, newspapers sport headlines in red ink, and cab drivers see
red because of extra-long traffic jams.</LD>
<LD>   But news of the congress remains nearly as scarce as ever. Despite
saturation coverage by the media, the government's propaganda czars
have been busy ensuring that reports out of the congress are cleansed
of real news value.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, as the 2,114 delegates meet behind closed doors to debate
policy and personnel issues that will affect this nation of 1.3
billion people, the media have turned the occasion into a love fest
for the party and President Jiang Zemin.</TE>
<TE>   "Let us sing enthusiastic songs about our achievements," exhorted
the headline of a typical editorial in the People's Daily, the party
mouthpiece.</TE>
<TE>   Newspaper articles boast that economic output has quadrupled since
market reforms began in 1978. Other stories focus on smiling people
whose lives have improved under the party's tender care.</TE>
<TE>   There is no hint of perhaps the most crucial item on the agenda:
the transfer of power from Jiang and other senior leaders to a new
generation of officials. Hardly anything has been said about Jiang's
expected successor, Vice President Hu Jintao.</TE>
<TE>   Challenges facing the Communist regime are barely acknowledged,
such as the fact that millions of Chinese would answer "No" to the
question posed by another People's Daily editorial: "Are you aware
that you're living in prosperity?"</TE>
<TE>   The lack of any real political discourse in the mass media
indicates how China's political system remains mired in its Leninist
past, observers say, even as the economy marches headlong into modern
capitalism.</TE>
<TE>   For all the new economic and social freedoms enjoyed these days by
ordinary Chinese -- who work, live and marry as they please -- the
Communist regime maintains an iron grip on political power and hews
to its old unaccountable ways. None of the key decisions at this
week's congress, from policy to personnel, is open to popular
scrutiny, opinion or approval.</TE>
<TE>   "I know this is quite different from elections in Western
countries, where you know who the candidates are and what kind of
policies they're going to enforce. Here, it's not so transparent,"
said teacher Mo Shu, who did find a silver lining: "Sometimes that
makes it more interesting. Everybody likes surprises."</TE>
<TE>   Almost all the news dispatches during the conclave have been
generated and vetted centrally, then handed out to media
organizations to use.</TE>
<TE>   The practice seems outmoded, because many, if not most, Chinese
are savvy enough not to be taken in anymore by the homogenized
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "It's in all the newspapers and TV programs -- you just can't get
away from it," said an exasperated Li Xin, a Beijinger who works for
a foreign trading company. "But there's nothing really worth reading
or watching. It's all the same -- all good things."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care what they're propagandizing about," said Mo, the
teacher. "I care about what they're going to do with China's severest
problems, such as corruption, unemployment and economic development."</TE>
<TE>   Any political discourse tends to be couched in the Communist-speak
of decades past. The People's Daily described the congress' agenda as
"holding high the great banner of 'Deng Xiaoping Theory,' completely
implementing the important thought of the 'Three Represents' " and
summarizing the party's "great practice of uniting and leading all of
the nation's peoples in constructing socialism with Chinese
characteristics."</TE>
<TE>   Headlines praise Jiang's "Three Represents" theory, a hazy
philosophy to allow entrepreneurs into the party, as "the
crystallization of the entire party's wisdom" and "a magnificent
blueprint" for society.</TE>
<TE>   Such lofty rhetoric fails to strike a chord with many urban
Chinese and only deepens the alienation many feel from the party,
they say. The congress, many say, feels irrelevant to their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't have much to do with me, or with any of the common
people," Li said.</TE>

<HD>Colombia Hunts Kidnapped Cleric</HD>
<DH>From the Vatican to the U.N., the world condemns abduction
by suspected rebels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>Troops backed by helicopters launched a massive hunt Tuesday for a
senior Roman Catholic bishop who was kidnapped by suspected leftist
rebels as the church was again caught in the cross-fire of the
country's four-decade-long war.</LD>
<LD>   Monday's kidnapping of Msgr. Jorge Enrique Jimenez, president of
the conference of Latin America's Roman Catholic bishops, drew
international condemnation, from the Vatican to the United Nations.</LD>
<LD>   Pope John Paul II appealed to the kidnappers to free Jimenez, who
was seized with another priest near Bogota, the capital, by suspected
rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The
U.N. called the abductions "unacceptable."</LD>
<TE>   Jimenez, 60, is bishop of the colonial city of Zipaquira, about 30
miles north of Bogota, known for its subterranean cathedral carved
out of salt.</TE>
<TE>   The kidnappers' motive was not immediately known, but in the past,
Marxist rebels have held priests for short periods, later releasing
them with messages or peace proposals.</TE>
<TE>   The army has suggested that the FARC, which was thrown out of
peace talks in February by former President Andres Pastrana, could
add Jimenez to the list of high-profile kidnap victims that it wants
to swap for jailed guerrillas. The list includes regional lawmakers,
a former defense minister and a former presidential candidate.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From the U.S. transcript:</LD>
<LD>   The road to safety begins by ending the aggression. Reciprocal
treatment is part of justice.</LD>
<LD>   The incidents that have taken place since the raids of New York
and Washington ... -- like the killing of Germans in Tunisia and the
French in Karachi, the bombing of the giant French tanker in Yemen,
the killing of Marines in [Kuwait] and the British and Australians in
the Bali explosions, the recent operation in Moscow ... -- are only
reactions and reciprocal actions.</LD>
<TE>   These actions were carried out by the zealous sons of Islam in
defense of their religion and in response to the order of their God
and prophet.... What Bush, the pharaoh of this age, was doing in
terms of killing our sons in Iraq, and what Israel, the United
States' ally, was doing in terms of bombing houses that shelter old
people, women and children with U.S.-made aircraft in Palestine were
sufficient to prompt the sane among your rulers to distance
themselves from this criminal gang.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Our kinfolk in Palestine have been slain and severely tortured for
nearly a century. If we defend our people in Palestine, the world
becomes agitated and allies itself against Muslims, unjustly and
falsely, under the pretense of fighting terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   What do your governments want by allying themselves with the
criminal gang in the White House against Muslims? Do your governments
not know that the White House gangsters are the biggest butchers of
this age?</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld, the butcher of Vietnam, killed more than 2 million
people, not to mention those he wounded. Cheney and Powell killed and
destroyed in Baghdad more than Hulegu of the Mongols.</TE>
<TE>   What do your governments want from their alliance with America in
attacking us in Afghanistan? I mention in particular Britain, France,
Italy, Canada, Germany and Australia.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We warned Australia before not to join in ... the war ... in
Afghanistan, and ... against ... its despicable effort to separate
East Timor. It ignored the warning until it woke up to the sounds of
explosions in Bali.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If you were distressed by the deaths of your men and the men of
your allies in Tunisia, Karachi, [Kuwait], Bali and Amman, remember
our children who are killed in Palestine and Iraq every day.</TE>

<HD>Iraqi Parliament Rebuffs U.N.; Hussein Move Next</HD>

<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>The Iraqi parliament unanimously rejected a U.N. resolution Tuesday
calling on Baghdad to allow the return of weapons inspectors as the
first step toward disarming. The vote didn't necessarily move the
region any closer to war, however, because Iraq's official response
rests with President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   One possible hint of Hussein's plans came when he authorized his
older son, Uday, to deliver a letter to parliament Tuesday asking
lawmakers to accept the resolution that they had denounced a day
earlier as a pretext for war and a violation of the country's
sovereignty. One state-run newspaper, Al Iraq, said the matter called
for "quiet wisdom," which political analysts took as a reference to
Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   Parliament's rejection could serve to register Iraq's strong
opposition to the resolution while at the same time letting Hussein
play the role of moderate peacemaker if he accedes to U.N. demands.
By accepting, he could also play for time and shift the focus from a
military solution to a diplomatic one.</LD>
<TE>   The White House dismissed the Iraqi vote as "pure political
theater."</TE>
<TE>   In his letter to parliament, the younger Hussein, presumed to be
speaking for his father, warned Iraqis that they must be prepared for
war regardless of Iraq's response. He also urged Arab nations to cut
off oil supplies to any country that attacks, or supports an attack
on, Iraq, a call that oil producers consider impractical and are
certain to reject.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do we even discuss it [the resolution] when this is a trap to
create a pretext to attack Iraq?" asked one Iraqi lawmaker, Adnan
Rashid, who joined his colleagues in the two-day emergency session of
parliament applauding each mention of "his excellency Mr. President,
the holy warrior, leader Saddam Hussein."</TE>
<TE>   Parliament's vote was largely irrelevant because only Hussein
supporters are permitted to be members, and the assembly acts on the
president's command. The official decision will be made in the next
few days by the Revolutionary Command Council, the nation's highest
governing body, which Hussein heads. The U.N. has set a Friday
deadline for Iraq's decision.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution calls for U.N. arms inspectors to return to the
country after a four-year hiatus and be given unrestricted access to
suspected weapons sites. It gives inspectors the right to interview
Iraqi scientists outside the country without the presence of Iraqi
officials and demands the destruction of any chemical, biological or
nuclear weapons. Hussein says Iraq no longer has any weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   But a senior State Department official confirmed Tuesday that Iraq
recently asked the U.N. for permission to buy 1.25 million doses of
atropine, a drug used for treating heart attacks in small doses but
effective in large doses as an antidote to nerve gas.</TE>
<TE>   The high dosage that Iraq was seeking, as well as the huge number
of doses, raised suspicions that Baghdad might be planning to use the
drug to protect its own troops, or possibly troops and civilians,
against any nerve gas it might use against invading U.S. troops.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. weapons inspectors have said they believe that Iraq has
stockpiles of deadly VX gas and sarin. Atropine is effective against
both.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. official declined to name the prospective supplier of the
atropine but said that the United States was discussing the matter
with the Turkish government. Turkey is a major trading partner of
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Atropine is not on the list of items covered by U.N. sanctions
against Iraq, so it could be difficult for the U.S. to demand that
the U.N. halt the sale.</TE>
<TE>   However, the U.S. official said, the Turkish and U.S. governments
"have common concerns about Iraq and what Iraq has done in the past
and might do again in the future," implying that Turkey might
cooperate in quashing sales by Turkish companies if the purchases
were deemed to be primarily for military use.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, White House spokesman Scott McClellan wouldn't
comment on the alleged order except to say it was something the U.S.
"would look into very closely."</TE>
<TE>   "We do not need any more proof that Saddam Hussein possesses and
is willing to use chemical and biological weapons," McClellan said.
"He has already used them on his own people. And I can assure you
that the Department of Defense is going to do everything they can to
protect our troops if they are called in to disarm Saddam Hussein."</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, speaking on ABC's "Nightline"
on Tuesday, said: "They might be trying to acquire atropine ... to
either protect themselves or to make it appear to us that they're
trying to protect themselves. I'm not sure how many of these they
actually acquired, and we're taking a look at it now."</TE>
<TE>   As the clock ticks toward the Friday deadline on the resolution,
the Bush administration has tried to avoid being drawn into
speculation about what it will do if Hussein rejects the U.N.
outright or tries to impose conditions on the unconditional
inspections demanded by the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Uday Hussein told parliament in his letter that the resolution
should be accepted "with limits on certain points but not, we say,
conditions." One of those points is the inclusion of Arabs on the
inspection team, which is due to leave this week for Cyprus to set up
a logistics base.</TE>
<TE>   The team, led by Hans Blix, a Swede who headed the International
Atomic Energy Agency from 1981 to 1997, has about 100 members from 49
nations. It includes eight Arabs: six Jordanians; one Moroccan; and
one Egyptian, Mohammed Baradei, the head of the International Atomic
Energy Agency. Baradei met with Iraq's ambassador to the U.N.,
Mohammed Douri, in New York on Monday and reiterated the Arab League
position that Hussein's acceptance of the resolution was the only
hope of avoiding an invasion.</TE>
<TE>   "What I tried to impress on him," Baradei told Associated Press,
"is that this should be a completely new phase with the demonstration
of full cooperation and full transparency."</TE>
<TE>   After Tuesday's vote in parliament, French Foreign Minister
Dominique de Villepin said that force will be used if Hussein fails
to cooperate with the United Nations. France played a major role in
slightly softening the language of the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   If Hussein accepts the resolution, as many Arab diplomats believe
is likely, he will do so with reluctance, believing his cooperation
offers no guarantee that the United States won't invade. Washington
has said it would return to the U.N. Security Council before taking
any military action if terms of the resolution are violated, but
President Bush has insisted on his right to take any action necessary
to protect the American people if the U.N. does not act.</TE>
<TE>   "The Iraq regime is a dictatorship, and it is the choice of Saddam
Hussein to determine whether he wants to disarm peacefully or if he
wants to be disarmed by force," McClellan said. "This is a final
opportunity for him."</TE>

<HD>Former Premier: Arafat Must Go</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that if he
is reelected as prime minister, his top priority would be to force
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat into exile. But
Israel's current leader said the nation should not "act in haste."</LD>
<LD>   Netanyahu's remarks, which drew cheers at the Likud Party
convention Tuesday night, put him at odds with his boss, Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon, who has sought to marginalize Arafat but has
stopped short of driving him out.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Sharon told the convention in a speech immediately
following Netanyahu's that Israel shouldn't move too fast on
expelling the Palestinian leader.</LD>
<TE>   Both Sharon and Netanyahu are hawks who have taken a tough line
with the Palestinians and blame Arafat, ultimately, for militant
attacks on Israelis. The Likud Party will hold a ballot Nov. 28 to
choose one of them as party leader ahead of January elections.</TE>
<TE>   Just hours after the convention, dozens of Israeli tanks and
armored vehicles swept into the West Bank city of Nablus in response
to a Palestinian militant attack that killed five Israelis at a
kibbutz Sunday, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   Helicopter gunships hovered overhead as tanks fired heavy machine
guns in the air.</TE>
<TE>   The army said in a statement that it had begun an operation
"against terrorist targets" in Nablus, its surrounding refugee camps
and the town of Bir Zeit. It said troops had arrested 30 wanted
militants.</TE>
<TE>   The incursion came a day after Israeli troops and armor raided the
nearby West Bank town of Tulkarm and an adjacent refugee camp in
search of suspects in the kibbutz attack.</TE>

<HD>U.N. May Ease Ivory Ban, Allow Limited Sale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>SANTIAGO, Chile</DL>
<LD>Moving to ease a 13-year-old international ban on the ivory trade, a
U.N. meeting agreed Tuesday to a one-time sale of 60 tons of elephant
tusks by three African nations despite objections by
conservationists.</LD>
<LD>   The 160 nations attending the U.N. Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species backed the requests by Botswana, Namibia
and South Africa to sell ivory culled in wildlife population
management programs.</LD>
<LD>   If the vote is finalized Friday, as expected, the three nations
would be authorized to sell their $5 million worth of ivory under
international supervision in 2004. Delegates rejected two similar
requests, by Zambia and Zimbabwe, deciding that the governments have
not demonstrated that they can protect their herds.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. delegation voted for the Namibia and South Africa
proposals but opposed the other three.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that what we did today is a part of protecting
elephants," said Craig Manson, head of the U.S. delegation. "We're
committed to an ongoing [conservation] effort."</TE>
<TE>   Trade in ivory was prohibited in 1989 after the number of African
elephants plummeted to 600,000 from about 1.3 million in just over a
decade.</TE>
<TE>   The five southern African nations seeking the renewal of the ivory
trade say their elephant populations are now too large for their
parks. They say they should be allowed to sell tusks from culled
animals because they have managed their elephant populations well.</TE>
<TE>   But other African nations warn that allowing the ivory sale could
encourage poaching.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to start seeing elephants getting killed. We are not
exaggerating. You will see it. And not only elephants, but you are
going to lose lives of rangers, of poachers," A.O. Bashir of the
Kenya Wildlife Service said.</TE>
<TE>   Conservation groups agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "When the trade of ivory is allowed, the trade of ivory
increases," said Ben White, a consultant from the Animal Welfare
Institute who criticized the U.S. delegation's vote. "The U.S. people
are solidly opposed to the ivory trade, and our representatives
should reflect that."</TE>

<HD>Bin Laden 'Could Be' on Tape</HD>
<DH>U.S. authorities say voice praising recent terrorist
attacks seems to be that of Al Qaeda leader, but further analysis is
needed to be certain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Meyer and Greg Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After more than a year of suspense over whether Osama bin Laden is
dead or alive, U.S. officials said they believe the man heard on an
audiotape Tuesday praising recent attacks against civilians in
Indonesia and Russia and urging new strikes on the United States and
its allies is the terrorist mastermind.</LD>
<LD>   Several U.S. officials cautioned that the National Security
Agency, CIA and other authorities would continue to analyze the
high-quality audiotape throughout the night for conclusive
confirmation that the voice is that of Bin Laden. But they said they
believe that the founder and leader of the Al Qaeda network --
silent, hunted and unseen since last year -- is the man heard issuing
a series of threats and calls to arms to Muslims around the world.</LD>
<LD>   The 4 1/2-minute tape was provided to the Qatar-based Al Jazeera
television network and broadcast globally beginning Tuesday afternoon
under the heading, "New audio statement by Al Qaeda leader Osama bin
Laden ... to the peoples of the countries allied with the tyrannical
U.S. government," according to a transcript released by U.S.
officials Tuesday evening.</LD>
<TE>   On the tape, the man believed to be Bin Laden refers to recent
terrorist attacks in Bali, Tunisia, Yemen, Pakistan and Moscow and
says they were in response to those countries' support of the United
States in its military strikes on Afghanistan and in other alleged
acts of aggression against Muslims, including in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The comments come at a troubling time as the U.S. spearheads a
coalition gearing up for war with Iraq and amid growing indications
that Al Qaeda is regrouping and planning more attacks in far-flung
corners of the world.</TE>
<TE>   The tape rang alarm bells at the White House, CIA, Pentagon and
elsewhere in Washington, officials said, because Bin Laden has been
known to make such public pronouncements just before a terrorist
strike, as was the case before Al Qaeda truck bombs killed 224 people
at two U.S. embassies in Africa in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Several U.S. officials said an initial analysis of the tape, based
on comparison with existing "voiceprints" of Bin Laden, indicates
that it is authentic and was made in recent weeks -- the first
concrete evidence that the Saudi-born fugitive survived both the
punishing military attacks in Afghanistan and perhaps the most
aggressive global manhunt in history. Many U.S. officials, including
the FBI's top counter-terrorism authority, had said publicly that
they believed Bin Laden was probably dead.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't doubt that it's Bin Laden, but there is no reason to rush
to judgment on this," said one U.S. official, speaking on condition
of anonymity. "We are waiting for our analysts to check all
possibilities. Significant portions of it could be Bin Laden, with
other parts spliced in.</TE>
<TE>   "Initial reports can be wrong," the official added. "But we're
hearing that [technical] people are saying, yes, it sounds like him."</TE>
<TE>   Several counter-terrorism experts said Bin Laden's apparent
resurfacing might have been triggered by the increasing drumbeat of
war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "The confrontation with Iraq is perfect grist for the jihadist
mill," said Daniel Benjamin, a former counter-terrorism expert at the
National Security Council and co-author of a recent book on Al Qaeda
and its conflicts with the West. "Even though he has no sympathy for
[Iraqi leader] Saddam Hussein or the regime there, Bin Laden has
always cast the confrontation with Iraq as another example of the
struggle between the infidels and the crusaders" and the followers of
Islam.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Bin Laden's emergence would underscore what critics of
an Iraq invasion have argued -- that the war on terrorism is
unfinished and that an assault on Baghdad would stretch U.S.
resources too thin. Senior military officials seem increasingly
impatient with the progress of the war on terrorism, particularly the
often fruitless sweeps of territory along the Afghanistan-Pakistan
border.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said he thought that the United States had "lost a little
momentum" in the hunt for Al Qaeda and argued for putting greater
emphasis on shoring up the Afghan government.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. counter-terrorism authorities -- and British Prime Minister
Tony Blair -- have cautioned in recent days that there has been an
alarming increase in the kind of intelligence "chatter" that normally
precedes a major terrorist attack, at a level unseen since the
assaults on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever made the tape is threatening the entire world and throws
their barbs at everybody," said one senior U.S. official. "Does this
significantly change anything? Probably not, except that it is a good
reminder that we are dealing with an international terrorist threat
that is still out there and that we have to band together and fight
it together."</TE>
<TE>   At the Justice Department and FBI, the airing of the tape put
authorities on an even higher state of war footing than they had been
previously, one official said. "It makes us have to be even more on
our guard, which is a hard thing to do because we are already at a
very heightened state of alert," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   If Bin Laden's voice is confirmed, it is sure to renew
hand-wringing over how the Al Qaeda leader escaped U.S. forces who
had him all but trapped in the snowy mountains near Tora Bora,
Afghanistan, last December.</TE>
<TE>   For two weeks, allied forces and B-52 bombers pounded Al Qaeda
fighters dug into the cavernous and rocky terrain. But when it was
over, there was no sign of Bin Laden, and it was clear that hundreds
of his followers had escaped.</TE>
<TE>   The missed opportunity is regarded as a major blunder in the
Afghan war. Army Gen. Tommy Franks, head of U.S. Central Command, has
been heavily criticized for failing to choke off exits with American
troops and for relying on Afghan forces that, in hindsight, didn't
seem to have been up to the task.</TE>
<TE>   The question of whether Bin Laden is alive remains a sensitive one
for the Bush administration as well.</TE>
<TE>   In the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, President Bush
talked of taking him "dead or alive." In later months, he began to
argue that capturing "one man" was not the primary objective of the
war. More recently, senior administration officials have bristled
when the subject has been broached.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, a spokesman for the White House and National Security
Council said Bush would not comment on the tape until more
information was available as to whether the voice was indeed Bin
Laden's.</TE>
<TE>   On the tape, the man asks: "Why should fear, killing, destruction,
displacement, orphaning and widowing continue to be our lot, while
security, stability and happiness be your lot? It is time we get
even.</TE>
<TE>   "You will be killed just as you kill and will be bombed just as
you bomb. And expect more that will further distress you."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said that they began analyzing the tape even as it
was being broadcast and that they were trying to determine how the
tape came into the possession of the satellite network, which has
been used frequently by Bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders to get
their militant messages broadcast to the world.</TE>
<TE>   The NSA and CIA are using a variety of ultra-high-tech means to
determine the authenticity of the tape, officials said. In addition,
the tape is being scrutinized to see whether it has been manipulated
to make use of recordings made by Bin Laden last year.</TE>
<TE>   Authenticating the tape should be possible, said Andy Merlino,
advanced technology manager for Virage Inc., a San Mateo company that
specializes in video analysis for media and biometric security
systems.</TE>
<TE>   Voice analysis systems use verifiable samples of speech from a
subject to create a "library" of vocal tones and frequencies, syntax
and semantic usage of the language. Products from Virage can
distinguish between 1,000 speakers using such technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Mimicry of Bin Laden's voice by another person would be detectable
because each person uses unique intonation and vocal frequencies that
can't be fully copied, Merlino said.</TE>
<TE>   "If he is alive, it means the [Al Qaeda] organization most likely
is more cohesive and organized than it otherwise would be," said
William Wechsler, a former director of Transnational Threats at the
White House and co-author of a report by the Council on Foreign
Relations on Al Qaeda's recent resurgence.</TE>
<TE>   There have been recent signs of stepped-up activity in the hunt
for Bin Laden. U.S. officials said a Pakistani physician believed to
have treated Bin Laden was recently detained in Pakistan and is being
questioned. Dr. Amir Aziz, a British-trained orthopedic surgeon, was
arrested in Lahore in October.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence officials said the best available information
indicates that if Bin Laden is still alive, he is likely to be hiding
in Pakistan or in the border regions of Afghanistan.</TE>

<HD>Quizzed About Chechnya, Angry Putin Strikes Back</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BRUSSELS</DL>
<LD>Russian President Vladimir V. Putin lashed out at a reporter who
questioned the Kremlin's war in Chechnya, challenging the journalist
to convert to Islam and come to Moscow for circumcision.</LD>
<LD>   At a news conference after a European Union summit Monday, Putin
also said Chechen rebels want to kill all non-Muslims and establish
an Islamic state in Russia.</LD>
<LD>   Putin became agitated after a reporter from the French newspaper
Le Monde questioned his troops' tactics in the war in the breakaway
region of Chechnya, which is predominantly Muslim.</LD>
<TE>   "If you want to become an Islamic radical and have yourself
circumcised, I invite you to come to Moscow," Putin said. "I would
recommend that he who does the surgery does it so you'll have nothing
growing back afterward." Circumcision is a tenet of Islam for all
males.</TE>
<TE>   Because of poor translation, Putin's remarks were not immediately
understood by the 450 journalists at the news conference or by senior
EU officials. Putin brought his own interpreters, and even the native
Russian speakers were unable to keep pace with his rapid-fire
delivery.</TE>
<TE>   Details of what Putin said were revealed Tuesday when Associated
Press translated an audiotape of the event.</TE>
<TE>   EU spokesman Jonathan Faull, who was not at the news conference,
said that if reports of the remarks were true, they were "entirely
inappropriate."</TE>
<TE>   The translation showed Putin issuing a broadside against the
Chechen rebels.</TE>
<TE>   "They talk about setting up a worldwide [Islamic state] and the
need to kill Americans and their allies," Putin said. "They talk
about the need to kill all ... non-Muslims, or 'crusaders,' as they
put it. If you are a Christian, you are in danger."</TE>
<TE>   In Moscow, the daily Kommersant said the summit "ended in a
serious scandal" because of Putin's comments, which Kremlin aides
said came in response to a "provocative question."</TE>

<HD>Charles Enters Royal Saga</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>After more than a week of silence, Prince Charles has waded into the
controversy that followed the abrupt end of former royal butler Paul
Burrell's theft trial, ordering an inquiry into his household's role
in the affair.</LD>
<LD>   Charles' private secretary, Sir Michael Peat, announced Tuesday
that the prince told him to review questions raised by the trial.
Peat plans to examine whether the palace covered up allegations that
a former member of Charles' staff raped a male colleague. Since the
case against Burrell was dropped Nov. 1, the royals have been reeling
from his intimate tales of life with Princess Diana, who died in
1997.</LD>
<LD>   The saga has emboldened other palace sources to come forward with
seedy stories. Most seriously, George Smith, a former royal servant,
has alleged that he was raped by one of Charles' servants in 1989 and
that the man tried to assault him again in 1995. Smith accused
Charles of trying to cover up the incident.</LD>
<TE>   The inquiry will also look at how the theft case against Burrell
collapsed so suddenly with Queen Elizabeth II's eleventh-hour
recollection that the butler had told her he was keeping Diana's
possessions safe.</TE>
<TE>   Critics claimed that the queen wanted to keep embarrassing
revelations from emerging if Burrell testified.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>A support group for victims of apartheid has filed suit in the U.S.
against 20 global companies for allegedly encouraging human rights
abuses by doing business with the racist regime.</LD>
<LD>   The suit names firms that include IBM, Ford, General Motors,
DaimlerChrysler, Exxon Mobil, BP and Shell, plus Swiss banks Credit
Suisse and UBS, and Citigroup, the largest financial institution in
the U.S. It does not specify how much in damages was sought, but a
spokesman for the plaintiffs said it was in the billions of dollars.</LD>
<LD>   "The corporations ... made massive profits while the suffering of
the victims of apartheid intensified," the Khulumani victims' rights
group and anti-debt campaigners Jubilee South Africa said in a joint
statement.</LD>
<TE>   The suit was filed in Brooklyn federal court Monday. Several of
the companies it named called the suit groundless.</TE>

<HD>Oil Tanker Is Metaphor for Nuclear Crisis</HD>
<DH>The drawn-out voyage of a ship filled with fuel for North
Korea matches the world's perplexity about how to deal with the
militarized country.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>For the last week, a ship by the name of the Sun River has been
sailing ever so slowly from Singapore to North Korea, where it is
scheduled to deposit 47,000 tons of fuel oil.</LD>
<LD>   At its usual speed, the tanker would reach the Yellow Sea port of
Nampo by Friday, but the consortium that leased the ship has directed
it to slow down while some of the great powers of the world wrestle
with a matter of international consequence.</LD>
<LD>   Should the ship be permitted to deliver its cargo despite North
Korea's admission last month that it had broken a 1994 promise to
suspend its nuclear weapons program in exchange for oil and other
energy assistance? Or should it be ordered to reverse course on the
high seas, an extreme measure that could further escalate the nuclear
crisis with North Korea?</LD>
<TE>   A rift is growing among the three principal players in the effort
to curb the North's nuclear ambitions: the United States, Japan and
South Korea. The Bush administration has taken the position that
North Korea doesn't deserve any more aid, especially not oil, when it
is in violation of international treaties on nuclear weapons. South
Korea -- supported, to a certain extent, by Japan -- wants to give
the North more leeway to negotiate the dismantling of its newly
revealed program to enrich uranium for nuclear bombs.</TE>
<TE>   Enter the Sun River. A deadline for making a decision on the
tanker has been set for Thursday, when representatives of the three
countries and the European Union are to meet at the New York
headquarters of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization,
or KEDO, as the consortium involved with North Korea is known.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the Sun River, which left port last Wednesday,
remains adrift on the high seas -- an apt metaphor for the
bewilderment in the international community about how to deal with
North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "The ship is sailing at a very slow speed in the international sea
awaiting further instructions," Koo Byong Sam, a Seoul-based official
with the energy consortium, said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   South Korean officials said they believe that the United States,
in the end, will allow the oil to be delivered, essentially
postponing a decision on further oil shipments for at least another
month. Under the 1994 deal, oil is to be delivered monthly until the
energy consortium finishes construction of two light-water nuclear
reactors in North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Although South Korea has publicly downplayed any differences with
the United States, it is hard to mask the growing schism between
hard-liners in the Bush administration and the government of South
Korean President Kim Dae Jung, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his
policy of reaching out to North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "If the ship is stopped, it will cause huge damage. We are
entering winter, and the North Koreans need the oil desperately. They
will interpret the decision as meaning that the United States is bent
on destroying North Korea. It will escalate the risk of military
confrontation," said Lee Jong Seok, a North Korea specialist with the
Sejong Institute think tank, which is funded by the South Korean
government and maintains close ties with the Kim administration.</TE>
<TE>   Lee said the North Koreans' uranium-enrichment project is believed
to be at least a year away from fruition, "so there is no reason that
the United States should be hasty."</TE>
<TE>   In advance of Thursday's deadline, there has been a flurry of
meetings in recent days. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State James A.
Kelly, who elicited North Korea's confession last month, has been
consulting with his counterparts in Tokyo, Seoul and, on Tuesday,
Beijing. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, said it is
China's view that "the parties should continue earnestly to implement
the 1994 agreement."</TE>
<TE>   The South Korean and Japanese foreign ministers met Monday in
Seoul and pledged to work together to persuade North Korea to abandon
its nuclear ambitions. A statement read here by a Japanese official
said that KEDO "has been effective ... and should not be dealt with
hastily."</TE>
<TE>   The structure of the consortium calls for the U.S. to pay for the
oil deliveries while South Korea and Japan pay for the building of
the light-water reactors. But all are to have an equal voice at the
meeting Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no vote," said Chang Sun Sup, South Korea's
representative to the energy consortium. "We will make a decision by
consensus."</TE>
<TE>   In the longer term, however, it is up to Congress to appropriate
the money, which amounted to $90.5 million in fiscal 2002. Even
before the revelations about the uranium-enrichment program, the oil
deliveries were anathema to conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   "For the next year ... or very much beyond the present, I see very
little support in the U.S. Congress for providing these fuel
shipments," Kelly said last week in an interview with PBS' "The
NewsHour With Jim Lehrer."</TE>
<TE>   The last delivery of fuel oil to North Korea took place Oct. 18 --
two days after the news broke about North Korea's weapons violations
-- but there was too little time then to stop it.</TE>
<TE>   The energy consortium has contracted to buy the oil through
January from Westport Petroleum, which has its headquarters in
Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Emmet P. Lynch, chief operating officer of Westport Petroleum,
would not comment on whether the contract could be canceled if the
United States pulled out of the program.</TE>

<DH>Witness at German trial of 9/11 suspect says Atta's group
spoke continually of jihad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dirk Laabs</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>HAMBURG, Germany</DL>
<LD>A German college student who was part of the radical Islamic scene
for two years in the late 1990s said a group of young men that
included three Sept. 11 hijackers was constantly searching for a way
to join a Muslim holy war.</LD>
<LD>   Shahid Nickels, a 21-year-old German convert to Islam, said in
court Tuesday that the young Arabs were almost obsessed with jihad,
cheerfully singing songs about martyrdom and talking of little else.</LD>
<LD>   "They always talked about Kosovo, Afghanistan, Chechnya. They felt
it was their duty to do something there," Nickels said at the trial
of Mounir Motassadeq, charged as an accessory to more than 3,000
murders -- those who died in the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and the
Pentagon.</LD>
<TE>   The group revolved around suspected suicide pilot Mohamed Atta,
who was older and better-educated than the others, and Ramzi
Binalshibh, who traveled throughout Germany, Nickels said, meeting
fellow fundamentalists in Cologne, Dusseldorf and Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh was captured in September in Pakistan and is in U.S.
custody. He described himself in a television interview before his
capture as the coordinator of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Even before his capture in a bloody shootout in Karachi, some
American and European analysts were saying that Binalshibh was a
figure of rising importance within the Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the testimony in the 3-week-old trial of Motassadeq, a
Moroccan accused of providing logistical support to the hijack teams,
has focused on Binalshibh and has bolstered the view that he was
among the leaders of the Hamburg cell.</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh introduced Nickels to the group in 1997. Nickels
described him as "very religious, very charismatic, very charming,
very intelligent. You had to like him. He knew many, many people, and
many people knew him. He had knowledge of the human nature.... He was
the person in the group who was respected the most."</TE>
<TE>   Nickels said Motassadeq introduced Atta and Binalshibh to a group
of Moroccan Muslims, who were thought to be among the most radical
fundamentalists in Hamburg.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday marked the first appearance at the trial of a lawyer
representing Stephen Push, whose wife died aboard the airliner that
crashed into the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   By German law, every person who loses a relative through a
homicide is allowed to take part in the trials of those accused in
the deaths. Push's German lawyer will be allowed to question
witnesses and call his own.</TE>

<HD>Webster Resigns Accounting Board Post</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas S. Mulligan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A new watchdog board created to address the recent wave of corporate
accounting scandals was rendered leaderless Tuesday, as former FBI
Director William H. Webster resigned the top post amid what he called
a "perfect storm" of controversy surrounding his appointment.</LD>
<LD>   Webster's action capped weeks of tumult stemming from a bitterly
divided 3-2 vote of the Securities and Exchange Commission on Oct. 25
that approved his nomination.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, a major accounting firm accused Webster of making
"false and misleading statements" about his awareness of financial
problems at a small company at which he had been a director.</LD>
<TE>   The political fallout led to the resignations last week of SEC
Chairman Harvey L. Pitt, who had championed Webster's nomination, as
well as the SEC's top accountant, Robert Herdman.</TE>
<TE>   Webster, 78, had strongly hinted in recent days that he would quit
rather than hobble the new board at its launch.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the SEC on Tuesday, he said: "I now believe my
continued presence on the board will only generate more distractions
which will not be helpful to the important mission of the board."</TE>
<TE>   The exodus of key regulators comes at a time when investors have
been clamoring for greater oversight of corporate America -- and the
accounting profession -- in the wake of the stock market's meltdown
and financial scandals at such giant firms as Enron Corp. and
WorldCom Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Congress responded with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, signed last summer
by President Bush, which, among other reforms, created the new Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board to establish standards for
corporate auditors and to monitor and discipline accounting firms.</TE>
<TE>   Although Webster's departure threatened to bring the work of the
fledgling board to a standstill, other board members said they would
proceed with their previously scheduled organizing meeting in
Washington this morning.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very anxious not to lose momentum," said board member Willis
D. Gradison Jr., a former Republican congressman from Ohio. He said
he hoped the SEC would name an acting chairman so that the board
could proceed to more substantive matters, such as hiring a staff and
securing a budget.</TE>
<TE>   The five-member board gets start-up funds from the SEC's budget,
which must be reimbursed when the board begins collecting fees from
accounting firms and public companies.</TE>
<TE>   Because the board reports to the SEC, the appointment of a
permanent chairman probably will not come not come until after a new
SEC chief is named, "and that could be a long way off," Gradison
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), incoming chairman of the Senate
Banking Committee, said the new SEC chairman should have a role in
selecting the head of the oversight board and implied that there
should be no rush to pick the SEC chief.</TE>
<TE>   "While it is greatly important that a new SEC chairman is
selected, it is crucial that someone of the highest quality and
integrity is chosen," Shelby said in a statement Tuesday. "It is a
significant position that should be filled carefully and not with
great haste."</TE>
<TE>   By law, the new accounting board must be fully operational by
April.</TE>
<TE>   The turmoil over Webster is rooted in his work as a director for
U.S. Technologies, a small, now nearly insolvent Washington-based
firm that has been sued by shareholders for fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Webster was the head of U.S. Technologies' audit committee in July
2001 when the company's accounting firm, BDO Seidman, warned the
committee of problems it saw with the company's internal financial
controls.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, U.S. Technologies fired BDO Seidman, saying its
work was too expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Webster had told Pitt about the controversies at U.S.
Technologies, but Pitt did not inform the four other SEC
commissioners before the vote on Webster's appointment. Pitt asked
the SEC's Herdman and his staff to look into Webster's role at the
company, and the staff found "nothing of concern," a Pitt spokesman
has said.</TE>
<TE>   The revelations about Webster's role at U.S. Technologies, and
that Pitt had decided against sharing the information with his fellow
commissioners, led to an uproar that drove Pitt to resign last week.
Herdman also quit.</TE>
<TE>   Webster, a former federal judge who directed the FBI from 1978 to
1987 and the CIA from 1987 to 1991, has not been accused of
wrongdoing. But BDO Seidman sued U.S. Technologies Nov. 1, alleging
that Webster had made "false and misleading statements" when he told
the Washington Post that the accounting firm did not inform him of
U.S. Technologies' problems until after the auditors were terminated.</TE>
<TE>   Webster has since said that whatever he learned from BDO Seidman
in the July 2001 conference call did not set off "bells" in terms of
its importance.</TE>
<TE>   He could not be reached for comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In his resignation letter, Webster said that "many forces at work
produced a kind of 'perfect storm' " over his tenure.</TE>
<TE>   "Notwithstanding my best efforts to communicate the facts
accurately and forthrightly, media interest shows no sign of
abatement," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other members of the accounting board pledged to continue with the
panel's setup while awaiting a new chairman.</TE>
<TE>   The board's initial work will involve adopting a fiscal calendar,
setting up a bank account, incorporating as a nonprofit organization
and other such "ministerial housekeeping chores," said Kayla J.
Gillan, former general counsel of the California Public Employees'
Retirement System and one of two Democrats on the board.</TE>
<TE>   She and Gradison said they were confident that such duties could
be performed without a chairman.</TE>
<TE>   The White House appeared to agree. Claire Buchan, a deputy press
secretary, said: "Judge Webster is a fine man, and we respect his
decision and wish him well. The president believes the work before
the oversight board is very important, and he urges the members to
quickly and aggressively pursue that work."</TE>
<TE>   Today's informal board meeting, originally slated for Webster's
Washington law office, instead will be held at the office of
Republican board member Daniel L. Goelzer, a partner in the
Washington law firm Baker &amp; McKenzie.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth board member is Charles D. Niemeier, chief accountant
for the SEC's enforcement division.</TE>
<TE>   Webster was backed for the board chairmanship by Pitt and his two
fellow Republican SEC commissioners. The two Democrats favored John
Biggs, president of the nation's largest teachers pension fund,
arguing that he would be more aggressive in policing the accounting
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Damon Silvers, associate general counsel of the AFL-CIO, the union
coalition that is becoming more active in corporate governance
matters, said the new chairman ought to be someone with "a stated
commitment to reform, a high reputation and real knowledge of
accounting."</TE>

<HD>Bishops Make Ministry to Latinos a New Focus</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry B. Stammer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's Roman Catholic bishops approved a new plan Tuesday for
ministering to Latinos, a reflection of both the growing presence of
Latinos in the church and the competition for their religious
loyalties.</LD>
<LD>   The annual meeting here of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops
has been dominated by discussion of the yearlong scandal caused by
sexually abusive priests. Today the bishops plan to vote on a revised
policy for handling such cases.</LD>
<LD>   But Tuesday, the prelates turned to another topic that is
transforming a church that has long been dominated in the United
States by the descendants of Irish, German and Italian immigrants.</LD>
<TE>   The growing percentage of Latinos among the Catholic faithful has
altered parishes far from traditional population centers such as Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Latinos now make up 39% of the United States' 65 million Catholics
and have accounted for 71% of the church's growth in recent decades,
according to church estimates.</TE>
<TE>   In one out of five Catholic parishes in the U.S., Latinos are now
a majority presence, a church study has found.</TE>
<TE>   "We are extremely aware of the growing predominance of Hispanics
in the United States," Bishop Joseph A. Galante of Dallas said
Tuesday. "In the new millennium, so much of what we do will be
ministering to Hispanics. They are not a small immigrant, isolated
group. They are not the minority. They are becoming a majority," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The new ministry plan, "Encuentro and Mission: A Renewed Pastoral
Framework for Hispanic Ministry," calls for incorporating Latinos
into the life and leadership of the church and grooming them for
leadership positions. Music, language and ritual books should be
available in Spanish, and evangelization of the Latino population
should be a major emphasis, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   That emphasis on evangelization reflects a major problem the
church faces. Even as Latino numbers are growing in Catholic
parishes, many other Latinos are leaving the church, often for
Protestant evangelical congregations.</TE>
<TE>   The largest numbers of Latino Catholics remain in the Los Angeles,
New York, Chicago and Miami metropolitan regions, home to a quarter
of the nation's Latino Catholics.</TE>
<TE>   But much of the growth is occurring in less-traditional areas.
Across the United States, bishops in places that historically have
had low numbers of Latinos now say they need Spanish-speaking
priests, liturgies that reflect Latino culture, and counseling and
social services tailored for the new parishioners.</TE>
<TE>   The growth of the Latino population in the church "is my No. 1
pastoral concern," said Bishop Joseph L. Charron, who heads the
diocese of Des Moines.</TE>
<TE>   Of the estimated 100,000 Catholics in the diocese, which covers
the southwest corner of Iowa and part of Nebraska, 25,000 are
Latinos, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In an area where Spanish-speaking priests are rare, "How can I
deal with the influx of minority people?" Charron asked.</TE>
<TE>   The shortage of Spanish-speaking priests is a major factor in the
success that evangelical churches have had in proselytizing among
Catholics, according to the bishops' Committee on Hispanic Affairs,
which produced the new plan for Latino ministry.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a lot of growth, a lot of vitality," Cardinal
Bernard Law of Boston told reporters Tuesday. "Yet it continues to
challenge, because of the growth and the lack of priests."</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the Catholic Church has one priest for every 1,230
parishioners, but only one Spanish-speaking priest for every 9,925
Latino Catholics, according to church studies.</TE>
<TE>   But bishops say they can also count on a reservoir of goodwill
among Latino Catholics. Those who have ministered to Latino
communities for years say many immigrants who come from countries
where distrust of the government is widespread see the church as a
natural home.</TE>
<TE>   Finding them, however, can be a problem, especially if they are
undocumented workers, said Charron, the Iowa bishop. As workers try
to avoid immigration authorities, "they become more and more
invisible," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Passage of the new plan does not guarantee success, bishops
conceded. Two years ago during a nationwide meeting of
ethnic-ministry leaders in Los Angeles, Stewart Lawrence, a research
analyst who had completed a national study on Latino Catholics, said
a key weakness of the church's past pronouncements was that bishops
had failed to set down a specific agenda that would incorporate
minorities into leadership positions.</TE>
<TE>   "There have never been adequate mechanisms in place to ensure that
important pronouncements made by the bishops at the national level
trickle all the way down to the faithful," Lawrence said then. "Each
bishop decides what he wants to do, and then you still have to
convince his pastors, and that's where a lot of the resistance is."</TE>
<TE>   This time, however, bishops meeting in Washington said they are
committed to pressing ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Charron could already point to some progress. Five years ago, he
had just one person on his Hispanic-ministry staff in Iowa. Today
there are five.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Pursues Bid to Censor Book on China's Nuclear Program</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. government Tuesday pressed ahead with efforts to censor a
book about China's nuclear weapons program, asking an appeals court
to block a former government scientist from showing the disputed
manuscript to his own lawyer.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department has asked the court to review a June 2002
ruling in which District Judge Emmet Sullivan found that the
government had violated Danny Stillman's 1st Amendment rights by
denying his lawyer access to the information in Stillman's
manuscript.</LD>
<LD>   "The District Court erred in reaching this conclusion," Justice
Department lawyer Mark Stern told the three-judge panel reviewing the
case. He said there was a "significant risk" of inadvertent
disclosure if a private attorney was given access to sections of a
manuscript that could contain sensitive material.</LD>
<TE>   Stillman, a retired scientist from the Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico, sued the government in 2001 for blocking
publication of his manuscript on China's nuclear weapons program. The
government cited national security grounds for holding up publication
of the book.</TE>
<TE>   The case is still before the District Court, pending an appeals
court ruling, which may come in the next few months.</TE>
<TE>   In his June ruling, Sullivan ordered Stillman's attorney, Mark
Zaid, to have access to the manuscript once he passed a security
clearance. Zaid has received a clearance.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan also rejected the government's move to block judicial
review of steps the executive branch takes in the interest of
national security to censor writings by former employees.</TE>
<TE>   "The government has asked this court to take the extraordinary
step of insulating its actions from judicial review and from
constitutional challenge," he wrote in June.</TE>
<TE>   "This court will not allow the government to cloak its violations
of plaintiff's 1st Amendment rights in a blanket of national
security."</TE>
<TE>   Stillman, who retired from Los Alamos in 1993, had submitted the
manuscript titled "Inside China's Nuclear Weapons Program" to the
Energy and Defense departments in January 2000, as required under
secrecy agreements dating back to his employment at the nuclear
weapons research lab.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen months later, the government said Stillman's manuscript
-- based on nine trips to China from 1990 to 1999 -- was classified
and could not be published.</TE>
<TE>   Stillman, who had headed the intelligence division at Los Alamos,
then filed suit against the government for blocking publication of
his manuscript.</TE>
<TE>   The 500-page manuscript includes observations based on trips
Stillman made to Chinese nuclear weapons sites during and after his
employment with the government.</TE>
<TE>   Since the suit was filed, the government has reached agreement
with Stillman to clear about 85% to 90% of the contents. The rest is
censored.</TE>
<TE>   Zaid said some of the portions the government wanted to classify
included references to Wen Ho Lee, another former Los Alamos
scientist who was fired from his job in 1999 amid spy allegations,
which were eventually dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Among issues still before the District Court include whether the
government can block Stillman from publishing information it deems
classified.</TE>
<TE>   Zaid argues that since six of the nine trips Stillman made to
China were after he left Los Alamos, he did not get the information
as part of his employment.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Begins Border Checks in Michigan</HD>

<DL>KIMBALL TOWNSHIP, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Border Patrol agents began stopping drivers at unannounced, rotating
checkpoints Tuesday in two areas of Michigan, looking for illegal
immigrants, potential terrorists and drug or weapon smugglers.</LD>
<LD>   The main purpose of the checkpoints is to stop immigrant
smuggling, said Loretta Lopez-Mossman, acting chief patrol agent for
the Border Patrol's Detroit sector.</LD>
<LD>   However, agents also will look for other types of smuggling, and
always are on the lookout for potential terrorists, Lopez-Mossman
said.</LD>
<TE>   "It's all about homeland security. Bottom line, we are here to be
vigilant about the safety and security of the American people," INS
spokesman Greg Palmore said before a news conference Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez-Mossman said everyone will be stopped wherever a checkpoint
is set up and there will be no profiling aimed at Arabs or others.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan is home to about 350,000 Arab Americans, which is more on
a percentage basis than any other state. The population is
concentrated in southeastern Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   New York, Vermont and New Hampshire are among the northern border
areas that already have similar programs, said Mario Villarreal, a
Border Patrol spokesman. Officials set up a similar program in
northwest Washington state last weekend, he said. The practice is
common in such Southwest border states as Texas and California.</TE>
<TE>   The Michigan checkpoints will be set up for probably two hours at
a time at various points in the areas of Port Huron and Trenton,
which are among the busiest for smuggling activity in the region,
Lopez-Mossman said.</TE>
<TE>   Port Huron, about an hour north of Detroit, is a bridge crossing
from Sarnia, Ontario. Trenton, south of Detroit, is not an entry
point but is on the Detroit River near the entry to Lake Erie and has
a lot of boat traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit, which has two busy border crossings, is not being
included in the checkpoints because officials are worried about
traffic tie-ups, Lopez-Mossman said.</TE>
<TE>   The checkpoints will be chosen according to several factors,
including whether officials have intelligence about smuggling
activity, Lopez-Mossman said.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Alcohol may be good for the heart, but a daily glass of wine or beer
can increase a woman's risk of breast cancer, researchers said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   One unit, or eight grams of alcohol per day, raises a woman's
chances of developing the disease by about 6%, but smoking, which is
linked to a range of other diseases and different cancers, does not
contribute to the illness.</LD>
<LD>   "The more women drink, the higher their risk of breast cancer,"
professor Valerie Beral of the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford told a
news conference.</LD>
<TE>   The scientists, who analyzed the results of 53 previous studies
into the effects of alcohol and smoking on breast cancer, estimated
that alcohol accounts for about 4% of breast cancers in the developed
world.</TE>
<TE>   Although the risk is small and represents only a tiny part of the
picture of what contributes to the disease, Beral said women should
know about it because it is preventable.</TE>

<HD>Bush's Security Bill Foes Give Up</HD>
<DH>Democratic opposition to labor provisions of an anti-terror
homeland agency erodes in light of GOP electoral gains. It's a win
for the president.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson and Richard Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A much-delayed bill to create a new domestic security agency gained
key congressional support Tuesday and appears all but certain to
become law, a development that would hand President Bush a
long-sought legislative victory.</LD>
<LD>   As Congress returned for a lame-duck session, support for the
president's proposed Department of Homeland Security fell rapidly
into place as Democrats concluded they could no longer resist Bush in
a dispute over the rights of government employees who would move into
the agency.</LD>
<LD>   House Republican leaders planned to force a vote as early as today
on a final version of the bill that would give Bush most of the
management powers he wanted, including the right to waive labor
agreements when the president determines national security is at
stake.</LD>
<TE>   A critical stumbling block in the bill's approval has been whether
the administration could revise civil service rules and void labor
agreements to boost the president's ability to respond to terrorist
threats.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate was poised to act within days despite the misgivings of
senior Democrats, as the erosion of opposition reflected Republican
electoral gains. The GOP will maintain control of the House and take
over the Senate in the next Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no doubt that the supporters of [Bush's bill] are in a
better negotiating position following the elections of last week,"
Sens. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.), John B. Breaux (D-La.) and Lincoln Chafee
(R-R.I.) acknowledged in a joint statement.</TE>
<TE>   The three centrists announced that they plan to vote for a
slightly modified version of the Bush bill, giving the White House
position a small majority. Most Republicans back the president on the
issue; most Democrats oppose him.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats could still mount a filibuster to block the bill, but an
aide to Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said such
maneuvering was unlikely to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   A filibuster could damage the reelection hopes of another Senate
Democrat in a runoff election in Louisiana. Democrats do not want to
force Sen. Mary Landrieu to explain a homeland security impasse as
she campaigns in her Dec. 7 runoff against Republican challenger
Suzanne Haik Terrell.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to giving Bush a major legislative victory, the bill's
enactment would clear the way for a belated adjournment of the 107th
Congress. Other legislation remains to be settled, including
bankruptcy reform, terrorism insurance and annual government
spending, but homeland security had been the predominant outstanding
issue.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would create a mammoth new Cabinet department, with
roughly 170,000 employees drawn from 22 federal agencies. Thousands
more workers could be heading into the department as the fast-growing
federal aviation security force takes shape.</TE>
<TE>   The final push came after months of stalemate. The House passed
its first version in July with a large bipartisan majority, an action
Bush praised. The bill then bogged down in the Democratic-led Senate
as the two parties failed to reach agreement on worker rights. With
White House support, GOP senators filibustered a Democratic version
of the bill before the election.</TE>
<TE>   After the Republicans gained enough seats in last week's election
to take full control of Congress, Bush pressed his advantage. He
called for passage of the bill during the lame-duck session despite
the initial suggestion from Senate Republican leaders that the bill
be held over until next year.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.), who will soon become majority leader,
called Nelson on Friday night to begin negotiations. On Sunday, staff
members of Nelson, Breaux and Chafee met with those of Lott and the
White House. Lott then vetted the proposal with House GOP leaders.
Afterward, the three centrists met and reluctantly agreed Tuesday to
give their support.</TE>
<TE>   Government unions denounced the labor-management provisions in the
bill. They said Republicans had yielded little to their demands for a
stronger union role in the new civil service rules and a stronger
check on the president's national-security waiver power.</TE>
<TE>   "The modifications are so negligible as to be meaningless," said
Beth Moten, legislative director for the American Federation of
Government Employees. She said the union would "strongly oppose" the
bill. Colleen Kelley, president of the National Treasury Employees
Union, also was opposed. The two unions represent nearly 50,000 of
the workers heading into the new department.</TE>
<TE>   Many details of the final bill were not immediately known Tuesday
night. But a 450-page draft circulating on Capitol Hill contained
these provisions, according to congressional aides:</TE>
<TE>   * The secretary of the new department could revise civil service
rules to give the president more latitude to hire, fire, demote and
promote the workers he wants. If government unions object, they could
seek changes and ask a federal mediator to step in. But the
mediator's recommendations would not be binding. The president could
also waive collective bargaining rights of government employees if he
notifies Congress that national security is in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   * Much of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms -- not
previously affected by the legislation -- would move from the
Treasury Department to the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   * A Homeland Security Council would be established within the
White House to coordinate domestic response to terrorist threats --
somewhat analogous to the National Security Council's role in foreign
affairs.</TE>
<TE>   * Airline pilots would be permitted to carry firearms as a last
defense against hijackers. Also, there would be a potential extension
of up to one year of a deadline for airports to ensure that all
checked baggage is run through bomb-detection machines. The deadline
is Dec. 31, but many airports are likely to fail to comply.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, however, apparently omits a proposal to establish an
independent commission to investigate the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle was not won over by the compromise, even though it appears
likely he will not seek to kill the bill through filibuster.</TE>
<TE>   "We all recognize the need for a fundamental overhaul of the way
in which we approach America's homeland security," Daschle said in a
statement. He said he favored a preelection proposal offered by
Nelson, Chafee and Breaux that would give workers more power and
would not support "any attempt to weaken that compromise."</TE>
<TE>   Daschle added: "There may be differences of opinion on different
components of the legislation, but there is no disagreement that we
need to complete our work on this bill promptly."</TE>
<TE>   Bush met with Republican leaders and the new interim senator from
Minnesota, independent Dean Barkley -- who was sworn in Tuesday to
fill out the term of the late Democrat Paul Wellstone -- to push for
final approval of his plan.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to press people right now in a very gentle way in
saying let's get a homeland security bill done -- one that enables
this country to be able to respond to threats, one that enables the
president to be able to put the right people at the right place at
the right time," Bush told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   At its core, the department would be an anti-terrorist
organization -- spearheading defense of the nation's borders,
airports and seaports from sudden attacks. It would include the Coast
Guard, the Customs Service, the Transportation Security
Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Secret
Service, the Border Patrol and many other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   It would be the third-largest federal department, following
Defense and Veterans Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Conceived in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the
department was first pushed by Democrats. Bush embraced the idea last
June and then shaped it to his liking. If the bill is enacted, he
would preside over the most significant government reorganization
since President Harry S. Truman oversaw the creation of the modern
Pentagon and national security agencies after World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates said the reshuffling would bring a much-needed focus to
an often-scattershot government response to terror. "Finally, we will
have a strategy to protect the homeland," Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice)
said. "This is the beginning of the solution to homeland
vulnerability. It will become law -- I'm hoping this week."</TE>

<HD>In St. Louis, Criminals Who Once Ran Now Use Their Guns</HD>
<DH>Chief orders use of bulletproof vests after a series of
attacks on officers in routine stops.</DH>

<AU>Stephanie Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>On the streets, word is, it's open season on the cops.</LD>
<LD>   In the last eight weeks, four St. Louis police officers have been
shot at -- not in violent struggles with wanted criminals, but in
everyday stops. The kind of work that used to be called routine.</LD>
<LD>   One was fired on when he tried to pull a driver over on a traffic
violation.</LD>
<TE>   Another drew gunfire as he responded to a suspicious-person call
by pulling over to speak with a pedestrian.</TE>
<TE>   A third officer was shot in the groin when she arrived on the
scene of a minor car accident.</TE>
<TE>   And just last week, an officer was ambushed in an alley as he
pursued a driver who had been steering erratically. The officer was
hit twice in the back and once in the arm; the ring finger of his
right hand was nearly severed.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, St. Louis cops have been shot at 37 times.
Adjust that for the size of the department, and that means police are
fired on here at least as often as they are in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   It's not the rising numbers that scare the beat cops. It's the
recognition that more and more of these armed assaults are unprovoked
and unpredictable. And becoming almost, alarmingly, routine.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be that criminals would jump out of their cars and run
away when we tried to apprehend them," said Officer Gary Wiegert, a
22-year veteran. "Now, they don't bother to run. They just shoot at
us."</TE>
<TE>   On the worn streets of a ragged north side neighborhood,
30-year-old Ben Escobar jams his hands in the pockets of his leather
jacket and shrugs his indifference.</TE>
<TE>   "People got to do what they got to do," he says.</TE>
<TE>   And then explains: "People are tired of the police harassing
them."</TE>
<TE>   His friend, a wiry man with gold-rimmed glasses, nods. "If you got
a burn on you, you might as well put it down on them, because they're
going to shoot you if they see it," he says. Translation: If you have
a gun, and an officer spots it, you might as well go down in a blaze
of glory. It is the bluster of a man with nothing left to lose.</TE>
<TE>   And it is echoing, all too often, down the streets of this city's
poorest neighborhoods, as a blood-soaked bravado takes hold among the
rotting abandoned buildings and weed-tangled vacant lots.</TE>
<TE>   For the last several years, this city of 348,000 has had one of
the nation's highest urban crime rates, according to Eli Lehrer, a
policing expert at the American Enterprise Institute. That statistic
takes into account violent and nonviolent crimes, including larceny.
Though homicides are significantly down in St. Louis this year, rival
gangs shoot back and forth, ever more brazen. Last month, one group
opened fire at a foe across Interstate 55, raking rush-hour traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Over the summer, officers were drawn into at least four
gun battles with suspects. One such free-for-all -- between suspected
gang members and police in unmarked cars -- left a 17-year-old boy
dead in an alley, shot in the back by an officer.</TE>
<TE>   "We have war," said Sam Moore, a civilian who works with gang
members. "To these kids, the police are the enemy."</TE>
<TE>   In response to the violence, Police Chief Joe Mokwa last month
ordered his 1,100 officers to wear bulletproof vests while on duty.
But some cops say that's hardly a solution.</TE>
<TE>   Echoing police in other cities -- most notably Cincinnati, where
cop-civilian tension erupted into riots in April 2001 -- some
officers complain that they have been "shackled" by department
policies and local ordinances.</TE>
<TE>   Wiegert, the police union president, complains about a requirement
that officers report the race of each suspect they stop. That policy
is designed to halt racial profiling. Wiegert contends that it makes
cops timid. Arrests in south St. Louis plunged 21% in the nine months
after the requirement was enacted, he said, because officers were
wary about being labeled racist.</TE>
<TE>   Wiegert is equally concerned about Mokwa's new pursuit policy,
which calls for officers to chase a stolen vehicle only if they
believe that the suspects are dangerous. Wiegert fumes that it only
makes police look impotent -- emboldening the bad guys.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think 'run and hide' was part of our oath," a frustrated
officer wrote the other day on an Internet bulletin board for local
law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   In the city's most troubled neighborhoods, young African American
men say police aren't backing off -- they're lashing out. They talk
of officers ordering them off the street corners where they hang out
with friends, of being forced to lie spread-eagled on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   But some youths do welcome the stepped-up patrols, including an
all-out effort to disarm thugs. Police have seized at least 380
illegal weapons in the last six months.</TE>
<TE>   "It's cool," said 18-year-old Rasheed Smith. "They don't harass
you unless you're doing something wrong. As long as they know your
face, they're not going to stop you."</TE>
<TE>   But a few blocks away, waiting for customers at a dilapidated
carwash, Kevin Robinson, 45, fears more hostilities. "Things have
been building up," he said. The edgy atmosphere here in many ways
mirrors the tension that exploded into race riots in Cincinnati a
year and half ago.</TE>
<TE>   There are some key differences. The riots erupted after Cincinnati
police shot an unarmed black man -- the 15th African American suspect
killed by officers since 1995. St. Louis police have used deadly
force far less often. Also, many blacks in Cincinnati had distrusted
police for years, contending that the department was riddled with
racist, brutal officers. In contrast, former St. Louis Police Chief
Clarence Harmon, who is black, was so popular that voters elected him
mayor in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Still, frustration among citizens has been mounting. While other
cities have seen a big drop in crime in recent years, the
improvements in St. Louis have been far more modest. From 1995
through 2001, the crime rate in major cities dropped about 30%. St.
Louis' reduction was just 7%, according to Lehrer.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the tension, community activists have been struggling
for years to set up a civilian review board to monitor the police.
The officers' union adamantly opposes such a board. And so far,
politicians have been cautious about pushing it.</TE>
<TE>   A group calling itself the Coalition Against Police Crimes and
Repression has threatened a boycott of St. Louis convention sites
unless a review board is in place by spring. A similar tactic in
Cincinnati has succeeded in keeping away a number of big-name
entertainers and groups, from Bill Cosby to the National Urban
League.</TE>
<TE>   Such pressure tends to "keep the pot bubbling," escalating tension
between police and civilians, said James Gilsinan, dean of the St.
Louis University College of Public Service. Still, he discounts the
idea that cops have become targets. While it may be tempting to see a
trend in the recent shootings of officers, he views each case as
distinct, the timing as coincidence.</TE>
<TE>Jeanette Culpepper would like to agree. She can't.</TE>
<TE>Just a few weeks ago, she was walking down the sidewalk outside her
home when Officer Christine Fernandez drove up in a police cruiser,
responding to reports of a two-car crash. As Fernandez got out of her
car to talk to the drivers, one of them
pulled a handgun from his waistband and opened fire. A bullet hit the
young officer's groin. Fernandez fired back at her assailant, hitting
him in both legs. Detectives later followed a bloody trail to the
suspect, who was arrested and charged assault. Fernandez is
recovering and hopes to return to patrol. "If I hadn't seen it for
myself, I wouldn't have believed it," said Culpepper, who heads a
group called Families Advocating Safe Streets. "Something is
definitely wrong. Trust me, a pot has boiled over."</TE>

<HD>Cooking Time May Benefit Diabetics</HD>
<DH>Shorter periods on the stove for victuals can reduce the
presence of a compound that aggravates the immune system, a study
finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Cooking food at minimum safe temperatures for short periods of time
may lower the risk of heart disease for diabetics.</LD>
<LD>   In a study appearing this week in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, researchers say a toxic compound is formed when
sugar, proteins and fat are processed at cooking temperatures for
long periods of time. This compound may increase blood vessel damage
in diabetics, the study suggests.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Helen Vlassara, a diabetes researcher at Mount Sinai School of
Medicine in New York and first author of the study, said the
compound, called advanced glycation end products, or AGEs, can prompt
an angry reaction from the immune system, eventually damaging blood
vessels.</LD>
<TE>   "AGEs attack virtually every part of the body," said Vlassara. "It
is as if we have a low-grade infection. They tend to aggravate the
immune cells."</TE>
<TE>   She said a lifelong diet high in AGEs leaves the immune system in
a constant state of low-grade inflammation, damaging the small and
mid-sized arteries. This, in turn, can prompt heart disease and other
problems common to diabetics, she said. Diabetics are particularly
sensitive to the effects of vessels damaged by the compound, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   But dietary AGEs can be controlled by cooking foods differently,
she added.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Eugene Barrett, a professor of medicine at the University of
Virginia and the president-elect of the American Diabetes Assn., said
the study is potentially important in the control of diabetes, but
more research is needed.</TE>
<TE>   He said research into the compound is still at an early stage and
it may be too soon to conclude that limiting AGEs will reduce heart
disease among diabetics.</TE>
<TE>   Vlassara's study used 24 diabetic patients divided into two
groups. One group maintained a normal diet recommended for diabetics
that included chicken, fish and meat. The other group had the same
foods, but cooked differently.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of six weeks, said Vlassara, the AGEs in the test group
registered declines ranging from 33% to 40%. She said the study was
too short to detect any fundamental changes in the patients' health.</TE>
<TE>   However, she said studies using diabetic animals have shown that
reducing AGEs can cut the incidence of heart disease or delay its
onset. Such studies need to be conducted in humans to prove the value
of AGE control, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The key to lowering AGEs, said Vlassara, is to cook for a short
time in the presence of high humidity. This means either boiling or
steaming meats for the minimum time required.</TE>

<LD>The Senate confirmed Antonio Garza Jr., a close friend of President
Bush, to be U.S. ambassador to Mexico on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The confirmation came without dissent on the first day of the
Senate's lame-duck session. Garza succeeds Jeffrey Davidow, who is
leaving Mexico after four years.</LD>
<LD>   Garza currently serves on the Texas Railroad Commission, which
oversees the state's oil and gas industry. His election as a
commissioner in 1998 made him the first Latino Republican elected to
statewide office in Texas.</LD>
<TE>   When Bush was governor of Texas, Garza served as his secretary of
state and frequently accompanied Bush on trips to Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Garza is a second-generation American whose four grandparents were

<HD>Gennifer Flowers Case Is Reinstated</HD>
<DH>Appeals court rules that ex-President Clinton's former
paramour may pursue libel and conspiracy allegations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Weinstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled Tuesday that Gennifer
Flowers, former President Clinton's onetime paramour, may pursue a
libel and conspiracy case against Clinton's wife, Sen. Hillary Rodham
Clinton, and two former top presidential aides, James Carville and
George Stephanopoulos.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-0 decision by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
overturns a ruling by U.S. District Judge Philip Pro of Las Vegas,
who threw the case out two years ago, saying it had been filed too
late and that some of the allegedly libelous statements were mere
statements of opinion.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday's ruling brings back into the spotlight a tawdry
controversy that the former president, his family and aides -- and
perhaps the public -- would like to see disappear.</LD>
<TE>   "The agony of the Clinton scandals for the country" will be
extended because Flowers' attorneys will be able to take depositions,
said New York University law professor Stephen Gillers.</TE>
<TE>   Flowers, who now sings in a New Orleans bar, burst into the public
spotlight during the 1992 presidential primaries when she told The
Star, a tabloid specializing in celebrity scandals, that she had had
a long-term affair with Clinton, then Arkansas governor.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton and his wife denied the allegations on CBS' "60 Minutes."
Flowers responded with a news conference in which she played
recordings of intimate phone calls from Clinton that she had secretly
taped.</TE>
<TE>   Seven years later, while living in Nevada, Flowers sued. She
contends that Hillary Clinton, now a Democratic senator from New
York, and her two "henchmen," Carville and Stephanopoulos, conspired
to protect Bill Clinton's presidential candidacy from Flowers'
damaging statements.</TE>
<TE>   Flowers claims that Carville, Clinton's campaign manager, and
Stephanopoulos, a campaign aide and later a key White House advisor,
defamed her and painted her in a false light by stating that she had
lied to The Star about the affair and that she had "doctored" tapes
of the phone calls. Flowers also asserted that Hillary Clinton was
the mastermind of the alleged conspiracy and exposed private
information about Flowers and organized break-ins at her residence.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit affirmed Pro's dismissal of all of Flowers' claims
based on Carville's 1994 memoir, "All's Fair: Love, War and Running
for President," and the claim that Sen. Clinton allegedly disclosed
private information and organized break-ins, saying all were barred
by the statute of limitations.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court also threw out all the claims based on
Stephanopoulos' 1999 book, "All Too Human: A Political Education,"
except a passage in which Stephanopoulos said Flowers had doctored
the tapes.</TE>
<TE>   But the appeals court reinstated the conspiracy claim and a claim
Flowers lodged based on an interview Carville gave on "Larry King
Live" in 1998. On that show, Carville said, "I think they found that
tape was doctored and CNN [even] found ... like 19 or 20 different
places."</TE>
<TE>   In his book, Stephanopoulos said investigations by CNN and Los
Angeles television station KCBS showed that the tape had been
"selectively edited."</TE>
<TE>   "Gennifer Flowers claims that defendants knew that she was telling
the truth, knew the tapes weren't doctored, knew the news reports
they claimed to rely on were wrong but accused her of being a liar
and a fraud anyway," Judge Alex Kozinski wrote in Tuesday's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "If Flowers' claims are true, her suit does not offend the 1st
Amendment. She has produced no evidence yet to support them, but
under our system of civil procedure she must be given at least some
chance to seek it before her lawsuit is thrown out," added Kozinski,
an appointee of President Reagan. Judges J. Clifford Wallace and
Richard A. Paez, appointees, respectively, of presidents Nixon and
Clinton, joined the opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Kozinski emphasized that because Flowers is "a public figure," at
least with respect to this controversy, she will have to show that
Carville and Stephanopoulos acted with "actual malice" when they
repeated statements made by other media about the tapes being edited
or doctored. She would have to prove by "clear and convincing
evidence" that the defendants knew the news reports were false or
disregarded "obvious warning signs" that they were false.</TE>
<TE>   "Flowers no doubt faces an uphill battle," Kozinski wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Flowers' lawyer, Larry Klayman of Judicial Watch, a
self-described Washington watchdog group that has sued both the
Clinton and Bush administrations, said he was elated by the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "Viva Las Vegas," Klayman declared, referring to the site of the
lawsuit. "Hilary Clinton and the other defendants will be deposed."</TE>
<TE>   But the senator's attorney, David A. Kendall, expressed pleasure
that the court dismissed several claims and maintained that "the
remaining part of the case is just as frivolous as it always was."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Little Brown &amp; Co., which published
Stephanopoulos' book, said the company was comforted by Kozinski's
comments about the high hurdle Flowers must clear to get to trial.</TE>
<TE>   "We are confident that ... Flowers will not be able to prove to a
court of law that the statement by Mr. Stephanopoulos was libelous,"
the spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Carville's lawyer, William A. McDaniel Jr., called the decision "a
substantial victory," and predicted that his client will prevail on
the claim remaining against him.</TE>

<HD>Congressional Newcomers, but Hardly Neophytes</HD>
<DH>House and Senate freshmen arrive with a wealth of
experience, including a governor and several returning to Washington.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For a crop of newcomers, these freshmen are remarkably experienced.</LD>
<LD>   The 60 or so people just elected to the House and Senate have come
to Washington this week to learn the ropes, but some could be viewed
as almost overqualified for the job. They include two former
presidential candidates, a former White House senior advisor and a
governor who has deigned to become a mere House member.</LD>
<LD>   But the new lawmakers all have one thing in common: They were
elected in a year when President Bush dominated the political
landscape.</LD>
<TE>   "Part of presidential power is how members of Congress interpret
what happened" in the last election, said Charles Jones, emeritus
professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin. "They
are going to be attentive to what Bush wants."</TE>
<TE>   The result is a new generation of Republican lawmakers who reflect
the old-fashioned virtue of loyalty to their president, and a hardy
cadre of Democrats who in several cases won against the odds.</TE>
<TE>   The class of GOP freshmen stands in striking contrast to the
Republicans who stormed Capitol Hill after the 1994 elections, when
the party won control of Congress for the first time in 40 years.
That group included many political amateurs determined to upend the
Washington establishment.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have is a group of people who have committed their lives
to government service," said Mitch Bainwol, executive director of the
National Republican Senatorial Committee. "These are people who are
not running against government; they are running to make government
work."</TE>
<TE>   The final makeup of the new Congress hinges on the outcome of four
undecided House races -- in Colorado, Hawaii, Louisiana and New York
-- and a Senate race in Louisiana, where Democratic Sen. Mary
Landrieu faces a Dec. 7 runoff against Republican Suzanne Haik
Terrell. As of now, the House will include 228 Republicans, 202
Democrats and one independent who usually sides with the Democrats;
the Senate will have at least 51 Republicans, 47 Democrats and one
independent who sides with the Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   The freshman class -- roughly 50 new House members and 10 new
senators -- will not be sworn in until the new Congress convenes in
January. But they are in Washington this week to get office
assignments, begin assembling staff and attend orientation sessions.</TE>
<TE>   The new members include a paper mill worker from Maine --
Rep.-elect Michael Michaud, a Democrat. There's also a
multimillionaire former senator, Sen.-elect Frank Lautenberg
(D-N.J.), who already has a federal building named after him, and
Sen.-elect Elizabeth Hanford Dole (R-N.C.), the former Labor
secretary who collected almost $900,000 in speaking fees in 2001. And
Dole and Sen.-elect Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) are veterans of the
presidential campaign trail; both sought the Republican nomination in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   The House Republican freshman class includes a celebrity of the
disputed 2000 presidential election -- Florida Rep.-elect Katherine
Harris, who as Florida's secretary of state was a key figure in the
controversial recount that delivered the White House to Bush.</TE>
<TE>   History was made with the election to the House of Linda T.
Sanchez (D-Lakewood), which will give Congress its first sister
lawmakers. Her older sibling Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Garden Grove)
won her fourth term.</TE>
<TE>   They will be joined in the House by brothers from Florida --
Rep.-elect Mario Diaz-Balart and Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, who won
his sixth term. Both are Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Other races rewarded people for whom politics has been a family
business. New senators include not just Dole -- wife of former Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) -- but John E. Sununu (R-N.H.),
whose father, John H. Sununu, served as White House chief of staff in
the first Bush administration. Another new senator is Mark Pryor
(D-Ark.), whose father also served in the Senate and who is a former
governor of Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   Both parties sent back to Washington two of their accomplished
political operatives. Democrat Rahm Emmanuel, former top aide to
President Clinton, won a House seat in Illinois; Republican Tom Cole,
former top aide to the Republican National Committee, won a House
seat in Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   The election did little to advance the representation of women and
African Americans. The new Congress will include 62 women in the
House and 13 in the Senate -- the same as in the current Congress.
There will continue to be no blacks in the Senate and 39 in the
House. The number of Latinos in the House will increase from 19 to
23, with none in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Another new House member will be William J. Janklow, a Bush
confidant who has been governor of South Dakota for 16 of the last 24
years. Governors running for another office generally seek a Senate
seat rather than one in the House.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough transition, from being a unitary leader to being one
of 435 people," said Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.).</TE>
<TE>   Two members of Congress will be making return engagements.
Lautenberg, 78, retired in 2000 after serving three Senate terms. But
desperate New Jersey Democrats turned to him in early October as
their ballot replacement for Sen. Robert Torricelli, who abruptly
ended his reelection bid because of questions about his personal
finances.</TE>
<TE>   Rep.-elect Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) served in the House from 1983 to
1995; he is returning after giving up his seat for a failed 1994
Senate bid.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an amazingly savvy group," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   On the ideological front, the elections may have reinforced the
split among Republicans between the conservative-dominated House and
the more moderate Senate. Many House GOP freshmen were elected with
the support of an anti-tax group that has made a practice of trying
to defeat moderate Republicans in GOP primaries.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP's new senators are a mix of conservatives and moderates.
But overall, the strength of the party's conservative wing in the
Senate suffered a big blow with the retirements of Jesse Helms of
North Carolina, Phil Gramm of Texas and Strom Thurmond of South
Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Democrats who bucked the election's GOP tide are like
Pryor and Rep.-elect Lincoln Davis (D-Tenn.), who campaigned on
conservative, pro-gun rights' platforms. Bush's shadow over the
election may push such Democrats into his camp on key issues.</TE>
<TE>   "People in moderate districts are going to be more deferential to
him initially," said a senior House Democratic strategist said of the
president. As long as Bush's popularity remains high, the aide said,
"he's going to continue to influence Democrats."</TE>

<HD>High Court to Hear Challenge to Gun Record Secrecy</HD>
<DH>City of Chicago claims that U.S. information tracking the
use of such weapons in crimes should be open to the public as other
crime statistics are.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to hear the Bush administration's
claim that the government's national data on guns used in crimes need
not be turned over to lawyers for the city of Chicago, which is suing
the gun industry.</LD>
<LD>   The case, to be heard early next year, highlights the continuing
dispute over whether gun records should be public or private.</LD>
<LD>   Chicago lawyers and anti-gun activists say that the government's
tracking of guns used in crimes should be made available to the
public, just like other crime records.</LD>
<TE>   "This is about the public's right to know about illegal
gun-trafficking," said Matt Nosanchuk, a lawyer for the Violence
Policy Center, which advocates for gun control.</TE>
<TE>   The Freedom of Information Act allows outsiders to obtain
unclassified government records, and Chicago's lawyers say such data
will help build their case against the gun industry.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, Chicago sued a number of gun makers and sellers on
the theory they created a "public nuisance" in the city. Since 1982,
it has banned the buying of new handguns in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago's lawyers contend the gun industry has deliberately
sabotaged the city's efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "They flooded the market around the city, and that facilitated the
criminal market in the city," said Jennifer Hoyle, a spokeswoman for
Chicago's city law department.</TE>
<TE>   To bolster their claim, the city's lawyers sought data from the
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.</TE>
<TE>   Two types of data were at issue. The first "traces" a firearm that
is used in a crime. About 200,000 times per year, ATF tracks a weapon
from its manufacturer to its seller to first buyer.</TE>
<TE>   A second database cites purchasers of two or more guns within five
days.</TE>
<TE>   When Chicago asked for the data, the ATF agreed to turn over
records involving gun crimes in Chicago and multiple gun sales to
residents of Chicago. It refused, however, to go further and turn
over national data.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago then went to federal court to challenge this decision
under the Freedom of Information Act.</TE>
<TE>   The national data "is not necessarily crucial to our lawsuit, but
we think it would be helpful," said Hoyle.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Bush administration and the National Rifle Assn.
maintain that these federal records should be held in private since
they contain personal information about buyers and sellers of guns.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. appeals court in Chicago said the city was entitled to
all the data, but the administration appealed.</TE>
<TE>   "Compelled release of the names and addresses withheld by the ATF
... would significantly intrude upon the privacy of hundreds of
thousands of individuals -- including firearms purchasers, potential
witnesses to crime and others," U.S. Solicitor General Theodore B.
Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   The government can shield ordinary records of criminal
investigations, Olson said, so it makes no sense to say the
government must reveal these records.</TE>
<TE>   The case does not directly concern the 2nd Amendment, but top
administration officials said earlier this year they believe this
amendment gives law-abiding individuals a constitutional right to
have a gun.</TE>
<TE>   If this view of the law stands, Chicago's ordinance could be
challenged and struck down.</TE>
<TE>   It is also possible that Chicago's bid to obtain the gun records
could be blocked by the Republican-led Congress.</TE>
<TE>   In July, a House appropriations committee added an amendment that
would bar the ATF from releasing the type of gun records sought by
Chicago's lawyers. If this measure is also adopted by the Senate and
signed into law, it would prevent the disclosure of the data.</TE>

<HD>Hacker Disrupted Military, U.S. Says</HD>
<DH>Prosecutors allege that British man shut down computer
systems on several bases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. prosecutors charged a British man Tuesday with hacking into
nearly 100 government and private sector computers, disrupting
military operations and causing $900,000 in damage over the course of
a year.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors said Gary McKinnon, an unemployed computer programmer
living in London, stole passwords, deleted files, monitored traffic
and shut down computer networks on military bases from Pearl Harbor
to Connecticut.</LD>
<LD>   McKinnon also hacked into NASA, the University of Tennessee, a
public library in Bethlehem, Pa., and several private businesses,
according to charges filed in a federal court in Alexandria, Va.</LD>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors filed separate charges against McKinnon in New
Jersey as well.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said they would seek to extradite McKinnon, who is
charged with seven counts of computer fraud. If found guilty, he
could face up to $1.75 million in fines and 70 years in jail.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Alexandria said
she did not know whether McKinnon was in custody.</TE>
<TE>   McKinnon accessed 92 separate computer systems from March 2001 to
March of this year, according to the charges.</TE>
<TE>   After gaining entry, McKinnon would use a software program called
RemotelyAnywhere to monitor network traffic and delete files.</TE>
<TE>   McKinnon downloaded hundreds of user passwords, the charges say,
and in several cases destroyed critical files that made the computers
unable to function.</TE>
<TE>   In one instance, he was able to knock roughly 2,000 military users
in the Washington area offline for three days. A spokeswoman said
McKinnon did not access any classified information. But national
security had nonetheless been compromised, one security expert said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're able to impact critical systems that the military
relies on, I would call this a serious attack," said George Kurtz,
chief executive of Foundstone Inc., a computer security company in
Mission Viejo.</TE>

<LD>At the boxy brick home of the Los Angeles County Public Library's
Paramount branch, patrons attempting to use the Internet encountered
a new watchdog software system Tuesday designed to allow unfettered
access for adults and varying degrees of access for children.</LD>
<LD>   If all goes well, the system will be implemented at all 84 county
library branches by year's end. By coincidence, the launch came the
same day the U.S. Supreme Court said it would take up the 2-year-old
Children's Internet Protection Act, which requires the federal
government to withhold funds from libraries that do not filter
Internet content.</LD>
<LD>   But the Los Angeles County filtering system was born out of local
concerns, not a federal mandate -- a distinction that county
Librarian Margaret Todd said makes all the difference.</LD>
<TE>   "The federal government really shouldn't be trying to tell local
communities how to do it," said Todd, who added that only about 1% of
the county system's annual $82-million budget comes from federal
sources. "Look at how diverse our county is -- it's very hard to
agree on what is objectionable."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles City library system, which does not take federal
funds, has no Internet filters on its public access terminals, said
spokesman Peter Persic. Patrons who wish to view only material
filtered for pornography or obscenity are offered the choice of
several search engines, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Todd said she believed that the county library system's approach
appropriately balances free-speech protections and concern for
children's welfare.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the county library board voted to make filters
available for parents.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, library staffers simply kept an eye on underage
children to make sure they had parental permission to use the
computers. Library officials say the majority of the 80,000 or more
registered computer users are adults.</TE>
<TE>   And library officials continue to remind parents that no filter is
foolproof.</TE>
<TE>   Sonia Rivera, a teacher's assistant in Paramount, worked side by
side Tuesday with her 12-year-old son, Andres, at a computer terminal
she had reserved.</TE>
<TE>   The seventh-grader could not get on the Internet if he were alone
at the library. His mother chose "no permission" for him, even though
she allows Andres to surf the Internet under her close supervision,
saying it is a must for many of his school assignments.</TE>
<TE>   Her younger son, 7-year-old Javier, is a different case.</TE>
<TE>   "No Internet. He's too young," Rivera said. "He doesn't need any
other information than books in the library."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Florida First Lady Columba Bush told high school students Tuesday
that she decided to devote her life to fighting drug abuse after
learning of her daughter's addiction.</LD>
<LD>   "My heart is broken because my daughter has a problem," Bush told
students at the Florida Statewide Drug Prevention Conference in
Orlando.</LD>
<LD>   "The minute I realized that my daughter faced the same temptations
that most of the children face each day, I decided to devote my life
to this cause."</LD>
<TE>   Noelle Bush, President Bush's 25-year-old niece, is undergoing
treatment at a drug rehabilitation center. She was sent there after
being arrested in January for allegedly trying to use a fraudulent
prescription to buy an anti-anxiety drug.</TE>
<TE>   She was jailed for 10 days last month after being accused of
possessing crack cocaine while in the center.</TE>
<TE>   Columba Bush recounted how her charmed life as Gov. Jeb Bush's
wife went awry after she learned about her daughter's drug problem.</TE>
<TE>   "I have not stopped one day speaking to all the young people how
terrible things can be," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Students at the conference said they were impressed with Bush's
openness.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Data on Nursing Homes Are Released</HD>
<DH>A Web site and phone number provide facts collected from
Medicare participants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>People can now get quality indicators on all 17,000 nursing homes in
the United States as part of a new government effort that began
Tuesday to give families tools to make better decisions for loved
ones.</LD>
<LD>   The government Web site www.medicare.gov/ and phone number (800)
MEDICARE now have information on such nursing home-related topics as
the prevalence of physical restraints at a facility or its percentage
of residents with bedsores. Information on deficiencies found during
annual inspections and complaint investigations also is available on
the site.</LD>
<LD>   The service is an expansion of a pilot program that began this
year in Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Ohio, Rhode Island and
Washington state.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a new approach to bringing about better quality care in
our nation's nursing homes," said Health and Human Services Secretary
Tommy G. Thompson. "Not only will consumers be better informed, but
nursing homes ... will be able to see more clearly what they must do
to make the quality grade."</TE>
<TE>   Donna Lenhoff, executive director of the National Citizens'
Coalition for Nursing Home Reform, called the program "extremely
important."</TE>
<TE>   "It means that consumers will be able to find out more
information, and they will be alerted to some of the questions they
need to ask about nursing homes," Lenhoff said.</TE>
<TE>   She and others cautioned, however, that the information should not
be the sole resource when choosing a nursing home. Visiting the
facility, talking to residents and getting information from the
long-term care ombudsmen's office in each state are still
recommended.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers should take the time to investigate thoroughly," said
James Parkel, president of AARP, the nation's largest lobbying group
for older people. "Nursing home residents are the most vulnerable of
all older Americans. We have a duty ... to promote their quality of
life."</TE>
<TE>   All the information provided by Medicare is based on data that
nursing homes must collect from residents routinely as part of their
participation in the federal Medicare program. Besides providing
consumers useful information, government officials are hoping the new
availability of information will prompt owners to improve their
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Homes that want to step up performance levels can get help from
quality improvement organizations, based in each state, under
contract with Medicare. "They're basically a government-paid
consultant," said Medicare administrator Tom Scully.</TE>

<HD>Tuition That Oinks</HD>
<DH>With a Missouri college taking payment in pigs, or any
other dining hall commodity, bartering becomes a way to finance an
education.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. CHARLES, Mo.</DL>
<LD>The gorgeous new dining hall at Lindenwood University serves pizzas
hot from a wood-fired oven, turkey breast carved to order by a chef,
platters of fresh-baked cookies and pie.</LD>
<LD>   But it's the pork chops dished out at the steaming Comfort Food
Station that keep junior Benton Haines in school. It's not that he
particularly likes them -- he's picky about his meals -- but the pork
chops are paying his tuition.</LD>
<LD>   In a program that holds out thought for food, Lindenwood
University now takes payment in pigs.</LD>
<TE>   As the stumbling economy drags down the small farm towns
surrounding the college -- towns that for decades proudly sent their
top students to Lindenwood -- President Dennis Spellmann has reached
out with an offer to barter. He'll trade a liberal arts education at
his small private college -- retail value, $11,200 a year -- for any
commodity the dining hall can use.</TE>
<TE>   Six families so far have swapped their swine for scholarship,
trading hogs that are worth little on the open market for classes in
business or education on Lindenwood's tree-lined suburban campus. In
the bargain, they've filled the cafeteria's freezers with
fresh-off-the-farm sausage, bacon -- even whole pigs, which are
smoked on an outdoor barbecue spit before home football games.</TE>
<TE>   "I often wondered if that was dad's pig up there," said Sally
Miller, 24, a kindergarten teacher who paid in hogs for her last two
years at Lindenwood.</TE>
<TE>   Now Spellmann is on a mission to expand the 3-year-old program;
he's hoping to bring 50 barter students a year to Lindenwood. He's
promoting the deal to rural school superintendents. He's pushing it
with agricultural trade groups. He's even advertising in the Farm
Journal. "Pork: The Other Tuition Payment."</TE>
<TE>   The offer is well-timed, and not just because farmers are
struggling. In the last two decades, college tuition has soared. Even
adjusting for inflation, the average tuition more than doubled at
public and private universities from 1981 to 2001, according to the
College Board. Median family income rose just 25%.</TE>
<TE>   Scholarships cannot fill the gap. Take the Pell Grant, a federal
program for needy students. The average grant covered 98% of tuition
in 1986 but less than 60% in 1999, according to the National Center
for Public Policy and Higher Education, based in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   The typical graduate leaves college carrying $18,000 in debt.</TE>
<TE>   To help parents shaken by such numbers, college administrators
have begun to get creative.</TE>
<TE>   "You're seeing a pattern of ingenuity," said David L. Warren,
president of the National Assn. of Independent Colleges and
Universities.</TE>
<TE>   Defiance College in Defiance, Ohio, will cut tuition for top
students who pledge to spend several hours a week in volunteer work.
Students who cheer on the college's sports teams get a hefty discount
at William Woods University in Fulton, Mo. And Clark University in
Worcester, Mass., offers a free fifth year of education to pursue a
master's degree to all who maintain B+ averages as undergrads.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of colleges will freeze tuition when a freshman enrolls,
shielding families from annual hikes. A few accept payments in
monthly installments, or even let parents finance four years of
tuition over a decade. A handful offer employment guarantees. College
Misericordia in Dallas, Pa., will settle graduates in paid
internships if they have not found good jobs within six months.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's barter -- an age-old practice that, to Spellmann,
seems ripe for revival.</TE>
<TE>   Lindenwood appears to be the only school engaging in direct swaps
with parents. But a dozen other small private colleges have signed on
with trading networks, also known as barter banks.</TE>
<TE>   Members of such networks provide free labor and merchandise to one
another. A central administrator keeps track of how much each member
"deposits" in the barter bank (in the form of work he does for
others) and how much he "withdraws" (in the form of services for
himself).</TE>
<TE>   As a member of the Green Apple Barter Service, La Roche College in
Pittsburgh can trade scholarships for catered meals, construction
work, advertising, or any number of other services. It doesn't have
to be direct barter, either. A parent who owns a ski shop could
snatch up a scholarship, "paying" for it by giving away long
underwear to a dentist, who might in turn fill cavities free for a
carpenter, who might then build bleachers without charge for the
college.</TE>
<TE>   Frame store owner Al Houston paid for his son's degree in
chemistry that way, bartering $75,000 worth of his services to other
members of the network in exchange for free tuition at La Roche.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a godsend," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the farm town of Silex, Mo., about a half-hour's drive
northwest of Lindenwood, Elaine Bruns echoes those words.</TE>
<TE>   When hog prices tanked in 1998, she and her husband, Kurt, found
themselves losing money on every animal they sold. They didn't know
how they could afford to keep their daughter, Sally Miller, studying
for her degree in education.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Spellmann -- himself a farm kid, way back -- stepped
in with the offer to barter.</TE>
<TE>   He figured out how much the meat from one pig would cost the
college on the wholesale market. He then discounted Sally's tuition
by that sum for every hog the Bruns delivered to a local
slaughterhouse. The pigs were processed there, and the packaged meat
sent on to the cafeteria.</TE>
<TE>   Elaine Bruns figures her daughter's junior and senior years cost
the family about 50 hogs. Those animals would have brought in less
than $4,500 at auction. To have them cover $22,000 in college tuition
is almost more than she can believe.</TE>
<TE>   "It was such a relief," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, she knew Sally was eating well at school. Especially on days
when the menu boasted "Missouri roast pork."</TE>
<TE>   "We were proud of that too," Bruns said. "You bet."</TE>
<TE>   "The program makes good sense for everyone," said Rex Haines, who
paid for a third of his son Benton's tuition with pork chops and pork
steaks this year.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, the bartered bounty has not forced Lindenwood
students into an all-pork diet. A few dozen hogs a year doesn't begin
to cover the daily meat demands at a school where vegetarians are few
and far between.</TE>
<TE>   "I would love to introduce California cuisine here, but if I were
to serve squid-ink pasta, I'd sink to the bottom real quick. This is
a meat and potatoes town," explained Ralph Pfremmer, the food
services director. (He does manage to sneak spinach-and-garlic tofu
on the menu now and then.)</TE>
<TE>   A formal protest by animal rights activists has not gained much
traction on campus. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals wrote
Spellmann this fall, asking him to stop accepting "tortured pig
carcasses" as tuition. He brushed off the plea. The rest of his mail
has been overwhelmingly positive. Strangers have called him "heroic."
He has been bombarded with queries from would-be applicants: How many
4-H steers would pay for a year at Lindenwood? Could the dining hall
use fresh lamb chops?</TE>
<TE>   "One community in the Ozarks came to me and said, 'We've got rocky
soil here. We don't grow a lot of stuff. But we want to send one or
two top students a year to Lindenwood. What could we send you?' I
thought, well, they have a lot of cedar trees there. What if they
could make bluebird houses and then I could sell them in a gift
shop?" Spellmann mused.</TE>
<TE>   He's now negotiating with three families who want to pay in beef
cattle. He's also considering taking sheep, though personally, he's
not much for mutton.</TE>
<TE>   Spellmann talks about barter as a way to help struggling families.
But he is bluntly honest, as well, about how the system can help
small private colleges. The number of students boarding at Lindenwood
has tripled in the last decade, to 2,400. More than 9,000 others
commute to the campus, which is just northwest of St. Louis. The
school has gained a name in Missouri for its teacher training
programs. It's even earned a bit of athletic celebrity, with a
national championship roller hockey team. The campus quadrangle
buzzes all day as students spill out of the century-old brick
classrooms onto shaded paths lined with wooden porch swings.</TE>
<TE>   Yet when the economy slumps, as during the recent recession,
undergraduates come into Spellmann's office, telling him they're
going to have to quit school. Because the college's fixed costs are
so high -- professor salaries, building maintenance and so on -- each
loss of a student is a blow.</TE>
<TE>   "We treat every empty seat in a class, every empty bed in a dorm
as an expense," Spellmann said. "It's almost like the economics of an
airline. It costs the same amount to fly the plane whether it's full
or empty."</TE>
<TE>   If he can fly Lindenwood full, he wants to do it. If he can get
fresh pork in the bargain, so much the better.</TE>
<TE>   After all, bartering for education is nothing new. Colonial
students at Harvard (think class of 1642) paid for courses with
livestock, hardware, even boots. When Lindenwood opened in 1827, it
accepted milk, potatoes and live chickens, stashed in a coop behind
the dining hall.</TE>
<TE>   The tradition persisted at some schools through World War II. One
young woman who entered Stanford in the late 1940s reported that
Brussels sprouts were served so incessantly, she was certain a fellow
student had signed a bumper crop over to the bursar.</TE>
<TE>   Such trades faded from fashion soon after, as programs such as the
GI Bill and Pell Grants emerged.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many students at Lindenwood applaud the revival of barter, and
only wish they could find a way to cut a deal for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "I owe the school quite a bit," senior Tom Marvuli said. "Maybe
I'll bring back some fish the next time I go on vacation to the
beach."</TE>

<HD>Harvard Cancels Irish Poet's Visit After Controversial
Remarks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>After student complaints, Harvard University said Tuesday it had
canceled a reading by an Irish poet who compared U.S.-born settlers
in the West Bank to Nazis and said they should be "shot dead."</LD>
<LD>   Tom Paulin, an Oxford University lecturer, was scheduled to appear
Thursday as part of the English department's Morris Gray Lecture
series.</LD>
<LD>   But in an e-mail to English majors Tuesday, department Chairman
Lawrence Buell said the reading had been canceled "by mutual consent
of the poet and the English department."</LD>
<TE>   Buell also apologized for the "widespread consternation" the
invitation to Paulin had caused. He said Paulin was invited last
winter, before his controversial remarks, solely because of his
poetic achievements.</TE>
<TE>   Benjamin Solomon-Schwartz, undergraduate president of Harvard
Hillel, said he was heartened by the university's decision, adding
that Paulin's comments crossed the line between opinion and "being
inhumane."</TE>
<TE>   In April, Paulin was quoted in an Egyptian newspaper, Al-Ahram
Weekly, saying that American Jewish settlers should be "shot dead."</TE>
<TE>   "I think they are Nazis, racists. I feel nothing but hatred for
them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Paulin also said he understands "how suicide bombers feel," but
suggested that guerrilla warfare would be more effective because
attacks on civilians could create a sense of solidarity.</TE>

<HD>Library Sex Site Case Goes to High Court</HD>
<DH>Justices will decide if institutions taking U.S. money must
filter porno from computers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to decide whether the nation's
public libraries can be required to screen sexually explicit Web
sites from their computers in exchange for receiving federal money.</LD>
<LD>   In May, federal judges in Philadelphia struck down this new
requirement on the grounds that it violated the free-speech rights of
library patrons.</LD>
<LD>   But Bush administration lawyers appealed, arguing that it is wrong
to say libraries have a legal duty to display all books, magazines
and videos, or that patrons have a right to see it all.</LD>
<TE>   It is the rare library that "collects Hustler magazine or XXX
movie titles," said U.S. Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson. "A
library that refuses to make available to its patrons pornographic
magazines or XXX videos may also refuse to make available comparable
material through those computers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He urged the court to revive the federal law, known as the
Children's Internet Protection Act.</TE>
<TE>   The issue has been complicated by problems with the current filter
technology, which may screen out pornography, but also can block
sites that are not obscene. For instance, students researching breast
cancer or sexual orientations have been blocked from useful sites.</TE>
<TE>   This is the third Internet pornography case to reach the high
court.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, the justices unanimously struck down a sweeping
law that made it a crime to post "indecent" material on the Internet.
This year, the court blocked enforcement of a narrower law making it
a crime to give minors access to commercial pornography. A lower
court is studying how far that law would reach if put into effect.</TE>
<TE>   The new law regulates only libraries that receive federal funds.
Two years ago, lawmakers attached the law to a spending bill. They
said the federal government should not subsidize the spread of
hard-core pornography.</TE>
<TE>   Public libraries that take federal money must install software
filters on their computers with Internet access. The software is
supposed to screen out "visual depictions" that are obscene or are
"harmful to minors."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the American Library Assn. challenged the measure as
unnecessary and unconstitutional. They said local libraries have set
policies to restrict the use of their computers, and they said there
was no need for a mandatory national rule.</TE>
<TE>   The federal law "takes a meat-ax approach to an area that requires
far more sensitive tools," the association said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   But Jay Sekulow of the American Center for Law and Justice, the
legal arm of the Christian Coalition, urged the court to revive the
law. "The 1st Amendment should not be used as a shield for
pornographers at the expense of our children," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the legal battle has focused mostly on the flaws in the
software filters. They scan for words, not images, resulting in
dozens of peculiar exclusions. For example, during the trial in
Philadelphia, it was revealed that filters screened out a site for
aspiring dentists, a second site that promotes federalism in Uganda
and a third that sells wooden wall hangings of scenes from the Bible.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the excluded sites could be linked to sex, but they were
not obscene or pornographic. For example, the filters blocked the
site for the Lesbian and Gay Havuarah of the Jewish Community Center
in Long Beach, while another screened out the home page of Wisconsin
Right to Life.</TE>
<TE>   The judges concluded that thousands of nonpornographic Web sites
were wrongly excluded by the filters now on the market. Moreover, no
technological solution was in sight, the judges said.</TE>
<TE>   "No presently conceivable technology can make the judgment
necessary to determine whether a visual depiction" is obscene or
pornographic, the judges said. For that reason, they concluded the
law violates the 1st Amendment because it would screen out too much
material that is both harmless and useful.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the justices will hear arguments in U.S. vs. American
Library Assn. and issue a ruling by summer.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the high court has been closely split on cases
involving free speech and federal funds.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, the court on a 5-4 vote said doctors in subsidized
clinics can be barred from telling their pregnant patients that
abortion is an option. But last year, the court, on another 5-4 vote,
said government-subsidized lawyers cannot be barred from challenging
welfare reforms in court.</TE>

<HD>Auto Makers Urged to Make Vans Safer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eddy Ramirez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A consumer group urged two major automobile makers Tuesday to begin
installing a second set of rear wheels on 15-passenger vans to
prevent the kind of rollover accidents that have killed at least 424
people since 1990.</LD>
<LD>   Public Citizen said replacing the current axle on the back of the
van with one that would hold four wheels, instead of the usual two,
could stabilize the vehicles, making them less prone to rollover
crashes.</LD>
<LD>   Fifteen-passenger vans are commonly used to transport student
groups, farm workers and church organizations. There are about
500,000 such vehicles on the road, federal figures show. Ford Motor
Co. builds the most 15-passenger vans, while General Motors Corp. has
a smaller share of the market. Both manufacturers maintain that their
15-passenger vans are safe as long as qualified drivers are behind
the wheel, all occupants wear seat belts and the vans are not
overloaded.</LD>
<TE>   Ben Hogan, a Birmingham, Ala., attorney who has represented
victims of van rollover crashes, said the concept of an extra set of
rear wheels "is not something the lawyers or safety advocates
invented. The manufacturers have known about this for years but done
nothing to make these vehicles safer."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the deaths that have resulted from rollover
crashes, hundreds of other people have been injured, according to
federal figures. Putting 10 or more passengers in the vans increases
the risk of rollover because it has the effect of raising the
vehicles' already high center of gravity, according to the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Public Citizen showed video footage Tuesday of a van
turning sharply. In one demonstration, when the van was equipped with
single rear tires, the front and rear right tires left the ground.
However, in another demonstration of the same maneuver, the vehicle
was equipped with dual rear tires on each side, and all the tires
remained on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Calling the retrofit "a simple fix," Public Citizen President Joan
Claybrook said it would only cost manufacturers about $135 per
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   "That's absolutely not true," said Ford spokeswoman Sara Tatchio.
"We would have to completely redesign the body of the van. Then, it
would not be a 15-passenger van."</TE>
<TE>   Tatchio said the manufacturer is looking into other safety
technologies, such as wheel sensors that monitor tire rotation and
the steering impulse, giving drivers better control.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not saying that dual rear wheels would not add extra
stability," Tatchio said. "But it's just not that simple."</TE>
<TE>   General Motors also backed the safety of its two 15-passenger van
models, saying they already have the longest wheel base in the
industry. The longer base -- the distance between the front and rear
tires -- increases stability.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the best features that we have to offer and make this a
safe and reliable vehicle," said GM spokesman Jim Schell. Earlier
this month, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended that
the chief executives of both companies look into technologies that
allow drivers to maintain better control of these vehicles.</TE>

<HD>High Court to Decide Victoria-Victor Battle</HD>
<DH>The lingerie retailer claims that a strip mall store is
cheapening the value of its brand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Victoria's Secret, the glossy retailer of lingerie, took on the owner
of a Kentucky strip mall store named Victor's Secret in the Supreme
Court on Tuesday in a legal battle that could determine the value
accorded to world-famous brand names.</LD>
<LD>   "If 'Rolls-Royce' were put on 100 different products, it would no
longer stand for anything special," said Washington attorney Walter
Dellinger, who represents Victoria's Secret.</LD>
<LD>   The trademark name "signals something to the consumer, a certain
quality and distinctiveness," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Victoria's Secret says it ranks in the top 10 of famous brands in
the apparel industry, along with names such as Nike, Levi's and
Rolex. The retailer has 750 stores nationwide and mails out 400
million catalogs a year.</TE>
<TE>   But its lawyers have not been too busy to ignore the tiny strip
mall store in Elizabethtown, Ky., owned by Victor Moseley and his
wife, Cathy. "We sell everything for romantic encounters," Moseley
said in an interview. "Lava lights, candles, leather products and
lingerie. And we have a small section for adults only."</TE>
<TE>   When he opened his store five years ago, Moseley said he wanted it
to be a secret from his family and friends. So he called it Victor's
Secret.</TE>
<TE>   The giant retailer did not welcome the association, however.</TE>
<TE>   Its lawyers sued the Moseleys under the Trademark Dilution Act of
1996 to force them to change the name of their store.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the trademark laws made it illegal to copy a famous
name or symbol to sell a competing product.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-dilution law goes further by barring the use of similar
names or symbols that blur or tarnish the famous brand.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were to make a Kodak chair, the theory is that I would be
lessening the uniqueness of the famous brand and blurring its
distinct image," said professor David S. Welkowitz, an expert in
trademark law at Whittier Law School in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   But judges have been divided on what is "dilution" of a trademark.</TE>
<TE>   In one famous case, the owners of Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp;
Bailey Circus sued the Utah tourism agency for adopting the slogan
"Greatest Snow on Earth."</TE>
<TE>   However, Ringling Bros. lost because it had no evidence that
Utah's claims to have the greatest snow hurt the circus and its claim
to offer the Greatest Show on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   The case of Victoria's Secret versus Victor's Secret marked the
first time the issue had come before the Supreme Court. And the
justices sounded both intrigued and perplexed during Tuesday's oral
argument.</TE>
<TE>   Suppose a small-town store puts out a product called "Budweiser
bug spray"? asked Justice Stephen Breyer. On the one hand, no one
would be confused because one product is bug spray, not beer, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the brewer would not be happy with the
association. "They are going to think [consumers] might think
'Budweiser' -- Yuck! And they don't want that," he said in a comment
directed at Victor Moseley's lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   The bug spray probably would not violate the law, said James R.
Higgins, a lawyer from Louisville, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   The key issue is the "selling power of the famous brand," he said.
"How does that little product hurt the selling power of the famous
brand?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Higgins argued that his client should be free to use "his name on
his own store" because it does not hurt the sales or the image of
Victoria's Secret.</TE>
<TE>   The "mere mental association" between one famous company and an
upstart with a similar name is not enough to trigger the law, he
maintained.</TE>
<TE>   But the lawyer for the giant retailer said the law was supposed to
prevent upstarts from chipping away at a famous brand.</TE>
<TE>   The name Tiffany is known as that of the famous jeweler, Dellinger
said.</TE>
<TE>   "But if you have a Tiffany's restaurant and a Tiffany's pet store
and Tiffany's shoe store, the name Tiffany wouldn't stand for the
same thing anymore," he said.</TE>

<HD>Parks Proposal Alarms Activists</HD>
<DH>They say the U.S. plan reversing a ban on snowmobiles in
Yellowstone and Grand Teton omits details of effects on environment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julie Cart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Environmental groups reacted with alarm to the Bush administration's
announcement that it intends to allow increased snowmobile use in
Yellowstone National Park.</LD>
<LD>   The park's proposed winter management plan was unveiled Tuesday,
and critics were quick to note that the environmental impact
statement omitted details of how the snow machines would affect the
park's wildlife, noise levels and air quality. A handful of groups is
expected to sue to prevent the policy from being implemented.</LD>
<LD>   The plan, which is not final, would reverse a ban on snowmobiles
in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks set by the Clinton
administration that was to take effect next year. The new proposal
imposes the first-ever daily cap on snowmobiles entering the parks,
but its net effect would be to allow 35% more of the machines than
typically visit.</LD>
<TE>   Park officials characterized the plan as a compromise among
snowmobile enthusiasts and manufacturers -- who favor unlimited
access -- and those who call for enforcement of the ban. If adopted,
the policy would go into effect in March.</TE>
<TE>   For environmental groups that have been tracking the issue for
decades, the draft proposal sets a questionable precedent.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that this is really a setback for national park
protection nationwide," said Steve Bosak of the Washington-based
National Parks Conservation Assn. "If they can go in and meddle with
a decision that was founded on years of scientific research and based
on laws that defend our parks -- and was well supported by the
majority of the American public -- who's to say they won't favor a
special interest that will mess up another park?"</TE>
<TE>   The Park Service received more public comments on the snowmobile
issue than any other in agency history, and 80% of respondents
favored a ban. Until recently, the Park Service had concurred --
issuing the ban after 10 years of study and following recommendations
from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration.</TE>
<TE>   For several years, park rangers have worn respirators and worked
in kiosks that require fresh air to be pumped in. This season, which
begins in mid-December, some rangers will be fitted with
sophisticated hearing protection.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to wonder what Teddy Roosevelt would think," said Jon
Catton of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, an environmental group
based in Bozeman, Mont. Yellowstone was made the first U.S. national
park in 1872. Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president, visited.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine: 'Welcome to Yellowstone, Mr. Roosevelt. Here are your
earplugs. We recommend you wear this mask over your nose and mouth.'
Would Teddy Roosevelt call this decision balanced, a compromise, a
real solution?"</TE>
<TE>   Yellowstone superintendent Suzanne Lewis acknowledged the intense
interest in the snowmobile management policy, which she said would
cost $1 million to set up and $500,000 a year to maintain. "Clearly,
this is one of the most complex issues the National Park Service has
ever faced," Lewis said. "It's been debated for more than a decade."</TE>
<TE>   The policy would require that 80% of the snowmobiles entering the
park be led by commercial guides using new-generation four-cycle
engines, reported to be quieter and less polluting. The general
public would be able to enter the park on traditional two-stroke
engines until the 2004-05 season.</TE>
<TE>   Park officials said noise and air pollution monitors would be
placed around the park to gauge the new snowmobiles' effects.
Yellowstone has a goal of reducing hydrocarbons by 90% and carbon
monoxide by 70%.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call with reporters Tuesday, officials gave few
specifics about the plan's scientific underpinings, other than to say
the policy would preserve the park's resources.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans don't want protection of Yellowstone National Park
weakened," Catton said. "The administration's plan clearly lowers the
level of protection.</TE>
<TE>   "Our first priority is to ensure that the administration reveals
the inherent harm in its plan. The public deserves to hear not a
script that satisfies the snowmobile industry, but the facts of what
this plan does to Yellowstone's air quality, wildlife and peace and
quiet."</TE>

<HD>Troubling Side Effects Found With Growth Hormones</HD>
<DH>Increasing number of anti-aging clinics may be putting
elderly patients at risk, researchers say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rosie Mestel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The growing use of growth and sex hormones to stay youthful in old
age carries troubling side effects that could outweigh potential
benefits, according to a study in today's Journal of the American
Medical Assn.</LD>
<LD>   The report, which tracked 131 elderly men and women taking growth
hormones, said such complications as carpal tunnel syndrome, joint
pain, swollen limbs, diabetes and other disturbances in blood sugar
regulation.</LD>
<LD>   The study also showed that the hormones had beneficial effects,
such as increasing muscle mass and reducing body fat, offering hope
that the hormones could improve health in old age.</LD>
<TE>   But for now, the authors said, the side effects are troubling and
insufficiently understood. They said the use of the hormones by a
growing number of anti-aging clinics may be putting elderly patients
at risk.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have any proven benefits and we don't know exactly what
the risks are, and have reason to believe they may be substantial --
so how can you prescribe this stuff to people?" said study co-author
Dr. Mitchell Harman. He is director of the Kronos Longevity Research
Institute, a private research center in Phoenix, and former chief of
endocrinology at the National Institute on Aging.</TE>
<TE>   In a rebuttal, the Chicago-based American Academy of Anti-Aging
Medicine said in a draft response that the side effects of properly
administered therapy are negligible and transient.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of older people are taking the growth hormone without
ill effects, said the society's founder, Dr. Ronald Klatz, a
Chicago-based osteopath and author of such books as "Ten Weeks to a
Younger You." The science behind the anti-aging benefits of the
growth hormone is "unassailable," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As people grow older, their bodies change, losing muscle and bone
mass, and accumulating abdominal fat. This is partly because of
declines in production of the human growth hormone.</TE>
<TE>   Adding back the hormone seems to help counteract these changes, as
reported in a landmark 1989 study on elderly men that helped trigger
the growth of anti-aging clinics.</TE>
<TE>   This trend has worried many endocrinologists, in part because
people who overproduce the growth hormone (a condition called
acromegaly) have increased rates of diabetes, arthritis, high blood
pressure, heart disease and possibly certain cancers. There is a
concern that elderly people taking the growth hormone might expose
themselves to such risks too.</TE>
<TE>   In the JAMA study, researchers led by Dr. Marc Blackman of the
National Institutes of Health administered the growth hormone or a
placebo to 57 women and 74 men age 65 to 88 for 26 weeks. For some
women, the sex hormones estrogen and progestin were added to the mix.
Some men received testosterone.</TE>
<TE>   All groups receiving the growth hormone responded with increased
lean muscle mass and decreased abdominal fat.</TE>
<TE>   The scientists found that strength and endurance improved only for
men taking testosterone and the growth hormone together. This group
experienced a "marginally significant" 6.8% increase in muscle
strength and an 8.3% increase in cardiovascular endurance. There was
no improvement for women in those areas.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear whether these small muscle and endurance increases
translate into real health benefits -- such as a reduced risk of
falling, said Dr. Lawrence Frohman, an endocrinologist and professor
of medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Side effects to the growth hormone were common, whether the
hormone was taken with a sex hormone or alone. Joint pain occurred in
41% of men taking the growth hormone, and none who were not.
Limb-swelling occurred in 39% of women taking the hormone. Carpal
tunnel syndrome occurred in 32% of men taking the growth hormone with
testosterone.</TE>
<TE>   Abnormal blood sugar levels were also observed in 18 of the 36 men
taking the growth hormone, versus only seven who were not. In five of
the men, blood sugar levels were in the diabetic range.</TE>
<TE>   Side effects went away when treatment was halted, but the study
lasted only 26 weeks. It is uncertain if the use of the growth
hormone over a long period would increase the risk of sustained side
effects.</TE>
<TE>   The authors recommended that for now, growth hormone use in
elderly men and women be restricted to clinical studies.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ronald Swerdloff, professor of medicine at Harbor-UCLA Medical
Center, said he has noticed impressive changes in the bodies and
moods of growth-hormone-deficient patients after they received the
growth hormone. He believes there could also be benefits to giving
elderly people the hormone, but far more needs to be known before the
treatment can be deemed safe for general use, he said.</TE>

<HD>Tejada Wins Short Battle for MVP</HD>
<DH>Oakland player's individual numbers might not have matched
those of Rodriguez, but he is a clear winner in American League
voting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The word "valuable" carried a lot more weight than "most" for those
choosing the American League's most valuable player.</LD>
<LD>   Though Texas shortstop Alex Rodriguez had one of the finest
all-around seasons in baseball history, accruing the major league's
most home runs and runs batted in, it was Oakland shortstop Miguel
Tejada, whose clutch hitting and superb defense helped the Athletics
win 103 games and the AL West title, who won MVP honors Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Tejada, who hit a career-high .308 with 34 home runs and 131 RBIs
and had the AL's longest hitting streak this year at 24 games,
received 21 first-place votes from a 28-member panel of the Baseball
Writers Assn. of America.</LD>
<TE>   The 26-year-old Tejada was second on six ballots and third on one
to finish with 356 points, easily outdistancing Rodriguez, who hit
.300 with 57 homers and 142 RBIs but finished second with 254 points,
including five first-place votes, seven seconds and 11 thirds.</TE>
<TE>   New York Yankee second baseman Alfonso Soriano was third with 234
points, including two first-place votes, and Angel left fielder
Garret Anderson was fourth with 184 points, the highest finish for an
Angel since Doug DeCinces was third in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised, because [Rodriguez] had a monster year," Tejada
said in a conference call from his native Dominican Republic. "I was
thinking the whole way he would win the MVP. I was real surprised
when they made the announcement."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, whose 10-year, $252-million contract is the biggest in
sports, had a better on-base percentage (.392 to .354), slugging
percentage (.623 to .508) and fielding percentage (.987 to .975) than
Tejada, but his Rangers finished last in the AL West with a 72-90
record, 31 games behind Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The only member of a last-place team to win the MVP was Andre
Dawson, who led the National League in homers and RBIs for the
Chicago Cubs in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Tejada, on the other hand, helped the Athletics match the Yankees
for most wins in the major leagues and led the A's on a 20-game win
streak, the longest in the major leagues in 67 years.</TE>
<TE>   Tejada hit a three-run homer in the ninth inning for Oakland's
18th win of the streak and had the game-winning hit, a bases-loaded
single, the next day. He hit .375 with runners in scoring position,
and his second-half performance (.325, 19 homers, 72 RBIs) helped the
A's fend off the Angels and Seattle Mariners in a tight AL West race.</TE>
<TE>   "The person who helps you win the most games should be the MVP,"
said Ken Macha, promoted from Oakland's bench coach to manager. "The
idea is to win games, not just put numbers up. Miguel put numbers up
every day for a contending team. Not only that, but he got a ton of
huge hits for us. He was most deserving of the award."</TE>
<TE>   An entire country seemed to revel in that award Tuesday, and some
1,000 people attended a reception in Tejada's honor at the Dominican
Presidential Palace.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unbelievable," Tejada said. "When I found out, everybody was
jumping around. No one could believe it. People were stopping me on
the street. Everyone who knows me said, 'There's Miguel.' I don't
know if I can count all the members of my family here."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the conference call with Tejada was delayed an hour and a
half because it took so long for him to get to the palace -- Tejada
kept getting stopped and congratulated on the way. He is the third
Dominican to win an MVP award, following Toronto's George Bell in
1987 and the Cubs' Sammy Sosa in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "To be mentioned with those guys makes me real happy," Tejada
said. "I'm real happy right now. This week, this whole month, will be
a happy time for me."</TE>
<TE>   Tejada gets a $100,000 bonus for winning, added to his
$3.5-million salary, and Rodriguez gets $200,000 added to his
$21-million salary.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of Rodriguez argue that such phenomenal statistics are
more difficult to attain on a losing team, but offense wasn't the
Rangers' problem, pitching was.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez was surrounded by Rafael Palmeiro (43 homers, 105 RBIs),
Ivan Rodriguez (.314, 19 homers, 60 RBIs) and Herbert Perry (22
homers, 77 RBIs), and the Rangers ranked fifth in the AL with 843
runs. But Texas had a 5.15 team earned-run average and gave up 882
runs, ranking 12th in the league in both categories.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll win an MVP one of these years," Tejada said of Rodriguez.
"And then he'll win three or four in a row."</TE>
<TE>   Tejada believes Soriano, a fellow Dominican, has the talent to win
an MVP award as well. Soriano hit .300 with 39 homers, 102 RBIs and
41 stolen bases to finish ahead of Anderson, who hit .306 with 29
homers and 123 RBIs to lead the World Series-champion Angels to a
wild-card berth.</TE>
<TE>   Tejada, Rodriguez, Soriano, Anderson, fifth-place finisher Jason
Giambi, who hit .314 with 41 homers and 122 RBIs for the Yankees, and
sixth-place finisher Torii Hunter, who hit .289 with 29 homers and 94
RBIs for the Minnesota Twins, were the only players listed on every
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the top 10 were Cleveland Indian first baseman Jim
Thome (.304, 52 homers, 118 RBIs), Chicago White Sox right fielder
Magglio Ordonez (.320, 38 home runs, 135 RBIs), Boston Red Sox left
fielder Manny Ramirez (.349, 33 homers, 107 RBIs) and Yankee center
fielder Bernie Williams (.333, 19 homers, 102 RBIs).</TE>
<TE>   In all, 21 players gained mention on the ballot, including Angel
shortstop David Eckstein, who was 11th with 24 points, and Angel
closer Troy Percival, who was 15th with 12 points.</TE>

<LD>Brian Cashman has worked his way through the frustration and
sleepless nights that immediately followed the four-game loss to the
Angels in the division series. There is less pain now as the general
manager of the New York Yankees talks about being "steamrolled and
outplayed" in the series that catapulted the Angels to their first
American League pennant and World Series title.</LD>
<LD>   The reeling Yankees might have recovered some from the mental
scars and wounded pride -- "We didn't bring our 'A' game and you'd
better have it in October or you're going to be sent home quickly,
and that's exactly what happened to us," Cashman said -- but they now
face a task as challenging as the Angels proved to be.</LD>
<LD>   "We need to cut payroll," Cashman said of a concept alien to the
team owned by George Steinbrenner and brought about by the new
bargaining agreement and not, the general manager insisted, by any
reevaluation initiated by the loss to the Angels.</LD>
<TE>   After all, Cashman said, those were four games and the Yankees had
won 103 before that. Any evaluation, he said, would be made on the
basis that the Yankees remain a team of Jason Giambi, Derek Jeter,
Jorge Posada, Bernie Williams, Mariano Rivera, Alfonso Soriano and so
many others.</TE>
<TE>   "When the dust settles, no matter what we do between now and
spring training," Cashman said, "when you have players of that
caliber, you're going to be good. How good remains to be seen, but
we've set a high ceiling [with four World Series titles in the last
seven years] and I feel no less confident about the future just
because of the loss to the Angels."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but it's a new game this winter.</TE>
<TE>   The new bargaining agreement has created an uncertainty affecting
even the free-spending Yankees with their industry-high local revenue
of more than $250 million.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, observed Cashman, "Wasn't that the intent? Weren't we
the target?"</TE>
<TE>   With its increased revenue sharing and so-called
competitive-balance tax on the high-payroll clubs that have driven
the market, the new agreement was aimed at slowing the Yankees and
tempering the overall salary growth.</TE>
<TE>   Cynics, of course, may question the sincerity of the Yankees'
payroll reduction -- they are believed to be so close to an agreement
with Japanese slugger Hideki Matsui that Cashman is expected to
travel to Japan on Thursday to consummate it -- but then hasn't
Steinbrenner already made some of his little people pay, lopping off
elevator operators and other fringe personnel at Yankee Stadium, and
reportedly eliminating a dental plan from the club's medical package?</TE>
<TE>   It comes down to this: Steinbrenner didn't follow through on his
threat to sue baseball over the new agreement, but when he sinks his
teeth into it, he will have to digest the projected loss of more than
$50 million next year through the payroll tax and increased revenue
sharing.</TE>
<TE>   The Times obtained a copy of the official and complete 2002 salary
and benefit tabulations that were distributed to general managers
here by baseball's labor relations department.</TE>
<TE>   Although the 17.5% tax on all payroll above $117 million will be
based on figures in 2003, the first year of the new agreement, the
2002 numbers illustrate the extent of the disparity between the
Yankees, at a total of $175.3 million, and the 29 other teams. In
fact, only two others -- the Texas Rangers at $130.6 million and the
Dodgers at $120 million -- would have been taxed if the $117-million
threshold had kicked in this year, and there is no greater disparity
between any two teams than that between the Yankees and No. 2
Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the 2002 numbers and a 17.5% tax, the Yankees would have
paid $10.2 million, the Rangers $2.3 million and the Dodgers, who are
determined to get below the threshold next year, $525,000. The tax
and the threshold increase each of the four years of the agreement,
and repeat offenders are penalized.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Yankees, Cashman would have to be a magician to get his
team below $117 million by cutting $58.3 million of payroll this
winter alone.</TE>
<TE>   He would not say how much he needs to cut. Nor would he outline
the specifics of how he intends to do it while also filling potential
holes if he doesn't re-sign his own free agents, including third
baseman Robin Ventura, relief pitchers Mike Stanton and Ramiro
Mendoza, and starter Roger Clemens. Clemens' option was not picked up
and he is owed $10.3 million by the Yankees, whether they sign him to
a new contract or not.</TE>
<TE>   "In general, I'd like them all back, but it may not be realistic,"
Cashman said. "How our team manifests itself when we're done remains
to be seen, but I need to cut payroll."</TE>
<TE>   It has been a long time since the Yankees faced a similar
personnel/payroll dilemma.</TE>
<TE>   Will Steinbrenner agree to re-sign the expensive Clemens at 38 so
Clemens can notch his 300th win on the YES network?</TE>
<TE>   Will Cashman decide by Friday's deadline to pay a $2-million
buyout or pick up the $11.5-million option on Andy Pettitte and his
tender elbow?</TE>
<TE>   Can he make financial and outfield room for Matsui while still
burdened with Rondell White and Raul Mondesi, who are owed $11.5
million next year and whom he yearns to trade, along with pitcher
Sterling Hitchcock, who is owed $4.5 million?</TE>
<TE>   Does he re-sign Ventura, who made $8.5 million last year and had a
poor second half, to a one-year contract, or try to find a way to
sign Edgardo Alfonzo or David Bell, both free agents, to multiyear
contracts? Can he re-sign Clemens and/or Pettitte and still turn his
conversations with free agent Tom Glavine's agent into more than shop
talk?</TE>
<TE>   Call them taxing questions that compound the confounding memory of
the Angel steamroller.</TE>
<TE>   "We respected the Angels, but we certainly didn't expect it to
play out the way it did," Cashman said of the division series. "Now,
I guess, you'd have to say we respect them even more because of the
way they continued to play through the postseason."</TE>
<TE>   If that sounded a bit begrudging, the Yankee GM has his mind on
the payroll, not paying respects.</TE>

<TE>   Stretching a Dollar</TE>
<TE>   With Major League Baseball's 17.5% tax on payroll above $117
million to take effect next year, several teams may take a hard look
at their spending. The following figures are from the 2002 salary,
bonus and benefits tabulations, a copy of which was obtained by The
Times:</TE>
<TE>   THE TOP FIVE</TE>

<TE>   Three of the four teams in the middle of the pack were well out of
the playoff hunt. The fourth proved you could win a World Series

<HD>Phillies Plunge Into the Market</HD>

<LD>Not satisfied with delivering multi-year offers to free agents Jim
Thome, David Bell and Tom Glavine on Tuesday, the first day teams
could make offers to free agents other than their own, Philadelphia
Phillies' General Manager Ed Wade said he would fly to Seattle on
Friday to meet with Jamie Moyer, the Mariner free-agent pitcher.</LD>
<LD>   Wade insists he is not making offers to make offers -- "it's not
as if we're taking billboards out in Philadelphia saying we're going
after these guys"--but that he is trying to aggressively enhance a
team he believes capable of contending, taking advantage of what
should be an improved revenue stream when the Phillies move into
their new ballpark in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   Of the offers to Thome, Bell and Glavine, Wade said he didn't
expect an immediate response.</LD>
<TE>   "As much as I'd like to get three voice-mail messages tomorrow
saying yes, I'm not going to bank on it," he said. "We know this
could take several weeks and that there are no guarantees."</TE>
<TE>   Even in an uncertain market, Glavine and Bell are expected to be
widely pursued. It may be difficult luring Thome out of Cleveland,
although the rebuilding Indians are unlikely to match the estimated
five-year, $75-million Philadelphia offer, which sets a high ceiling
for any other club that may bid on him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The general managers have been going from one heavy issue to
another during their annual meeting in Tucson. One minute it's bat
boys. The next: uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Alderson, baseball's executive vice president of operations,
met with general managers Tuesday to discuss new directives
prohibiting players from tucking their pants into their shoes, for
instance, or putting individual tributes on their uniforms or caps,
as some of the St. Louis Cardinals did in tribute to the late Darryl
Kile.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not looking to make all uniforms uniform," Alderson said.
"We're looking to eliminate extreme cases."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger General Manager Dan Evans and assistant Kim Ng will leave
the meetings and travel to Skokie, Ill., today for the funeral of
Chicago White Sox senior vice president Jack Gould, who died Monday
at 81. Gould was a mentor to Evans and Ng when they were with the
White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   -- Ross Newhan</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel pitching coach Bud Black rejected a two-year contract offer
from the club and instead agreed to a one-year deal.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels signed their other major league coaches to two-year
deals. Black declined to discuss why he rejected his but said the
decision did not signal an intention to leave the Angels after next
season.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going anywhere," Black said. "A one-year deal just seemed
better."</TE>
<TE>   The market for pitching coaches has jumped dramatically this fall
and could do so again next year. The New York Mets offered their
pitching coach job -- at a reported $450,000 -- to Dodger senior vice
president Dave Wallace, who turned it down.</TE>
<TE>   Black, who withdrew his name from consideration for the Indians'
managerial vacancy, has expressed interest in managing closer to his
home in the San Diego area.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe he'll have some different opportunities, maybe not,"
General Manager Bill Stoneman said. "Certainly, we're happy with
him."</TE>
<TE>   Roenicke, hitting coach Mickey Hatcher, first base coach Alfredo
Griffin and bench coach Joe Maddon all agreed to two-year contracts.
Stoneman said bullpen coach Bobby Ramos rejected a two-year deal,
citing the desire to spend more time at his family home in Florida.
Ramos will become the Angels' roving minor league catching
instructor.</TE>
<TE>   Bullpen catcher Orlando Mercado, who also received a two-year
contract, is a candidate to replace Ramos.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel third baseman Troy Glaus had surgery to remove an enlarged
nerve from his right foot.</TE>
<TE>   He is expected to be ready for spring training.</TE>

<TE>   A home run by Barry Bonds couldn't prevent major league All-Stars
from losing to their Japanese counterparts for the third straight
day, 8-6, at Osaka, Japan.</TE>

<HD>Federal Prosecutors Allege Pick-Six Fraud</HD>
<DH>Three men are charged in Breeders' Cup betting case. They
surrender to authorities in New York.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John J. Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Federal prosecutors charged three former fraternity brothers Tuesday
with manipulating a major computer betting system to create more than
$3 million in winning pick-six wagers after races already had been
run at this year's Breeders' Cup.</LD>
<LD>   The alleged conspiracy was one of the biggest frauds in horse
racing history, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Named in the criminal complaint were Christopher Harn, Derrick
Davis and Glen DaSilva, all 29, who attended Drexel University in
Philadelphia.</LD>
<TE>   Until he was fired recently, Harn was employed as a senior
programmer by Autotote Systems Inc., which processes a large
percentage of wagers placed on horse races throughout North America.</TE>
<TE>   "This was an inside job," said Michael J. Hoblock Jr., chairman of
the New York State Racing &amp; Wagering Board, who urged the racing
industry to quickly tighten security.</TE>
<TE>   "The complaint alleged that these defendants used their access to
the computer systems ... to create a sure thing," said James B.
Comey, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.</TE>
<TE>   He compared the scheme to one depicted in the motion picture "The
Sting," adding, "The movie was already made but with much
better-looking people -- Paul Newman and Robert Redford."</TE>
<TE>   In both the movie and in real life, Comey said, those involved
took advantage of a time lag between the completion of the races and
the reporting of their results.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, the complaint alleges, there was a delay between the
transmission of the wagering data on the pick six, and there was a
window that was available that allowed Mr. Harn to manipulate the
bets," he charged.</TE>
<TE>   Government lawyers alleged that the former members of the Tau
Kappa Epsilon fraternity, who surrendered Tuesday to authorities
here, rigged six winning pick-six wagers on Oct. 26 for the Breeders'
Cup races at Arlington Park in Arlington Heights, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and Harn appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark Fox but
did not enter pleas. They were released on $200,000 bond.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris maintains his innocence and nothing that happened today is
going to change that," said Harn's lawyer, Daniel Conti.</TE>
<TE>   "My client's position is that he did nothing illegal," said Steven
Allen, Davis' lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Rae Koshetz, an attorney for DaSilva, declined to comment on the
charges.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted on the charges of conspiring to commit wire fraud by
fixing bets that generated fraudulent winnings, the three defendants
face a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Comey said the investigation was continuing and that additional
charges could be filed.</TE>
<TE>   To win the pick six, a bettor has to correctly select the winning
horse in six consecutive races.</TE>
<TE>   For the final six Breeders' Cup races, the bets were to have paid
$3,067,821 -- money that is being withheld. Comey said the three
conspired to use Harn's computer access to alter bets after they were
placed.</TE>
<TE>   Court papers alleged that Davis made the bets through an automated
New York Off-Track Betting telephone account.</TE>
<TE>   As the Breeders' Cup races were underway, the complaint charged,
Harn connected Autotote's computer in Delaware to an OTB computer in
Poughkeepsie, N.Y., that had Davis' records.</TE>
<TE>   Harn had reported to Autotote's Delaware facility, even though he
was not scheduled to work that day. He was seen using his cellular
phone in the office.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint charged that Harn's and Davis' cellular phones were
in contact with each other while the Breeders' Cup races were being
run, and that Harn's cellular phone was also used to call OTB
approximately when the pick-six wager was placed through Davis'
account.</TE>
<TE>   Betting a single horse in each of the first four pick-six races,
Davis selected all winners, even though two were longshots. He then
bet on every horse in the last two races of the pick six, ensuring he
could not lose since he had the first four races correct.</TE>
<TE>   The court papers said that winning ticket information is examined
"some time" after the races have been run. "Consequently, there is a
lag between the time the result of a race is known and the time
winning bets are identified," documents filed by prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint also alleged that DaSilva, perhaps in a rehearsal,
collected on a winning pick-four bet at Balmoral Park, a harness
track in suburban Chicago, and on a pick-six bet at Belmont Park in
New York City in early October for a total of $118,000.</TE>
<TE>   Both wagers were made through the same betting hub Davis used for
the Breeders' Cup.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the Illinois Racing Board announced that it was
suspending wagers indefinitely on pick-four, pick-six and pick-nine
bets until the integrity of the tote system could be assured.</TE>
<TE>   Hoblock, the New York state racing chairman, took pains to assure
bettors that the criminal complaint filed Tuesday should "sound a
message loud and clear to those who try to beat the system."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Smith, commissioner of the National Thoroughbred Racing Assn.,
said in a statement: "We commend the authorities on the arrests today
in the pick-six case and support prosecutors to the fullest extent of
the law. We have said from the beginning, our focus is not only on
last month's Breeders' Cup pick six but also on protecting the
long-term integrity of the entire pari-mutuel system....</TE>
<TE>   "From the first indication that a problem existed, the horse
racing industry has viewed this challenge very seriously. We will do
everything necessary to protect the interests of our fans and
customers and to earn their confidence."</TE>

<LD>Are you curious about whatever happened to Bo Jackson, the former
major leaguer and NFL star? His football career ended with a hip
injury in 1991, although he played baseball until 1994.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson, who turns 40 on Nov. 30, has a Chicago company,
N'genuity, that deals in food processing and distribution.</LD>
<LD>   He and his physician wife, Linda, and their three children live in
a Chicago suburb. They also have a hunting lodge with 700 acres
stocked for rabbit and deer hunting.</LD>
<TE>   "I got everything going good for me," Jackson told the Associated
Press.</TE>
<TE>   And as good an athlete as he was, he's no sports fan.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't watch no football, no baseball, no basketball," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds USC's single-game record for touchdowns on
kickoff returns?</TE>
<TE>   Fact of life: Blackie Sherrod in the Dallas Morning News:
"Remembered philosophy from the late Abe Lemons: 'You don't coach
seniors. You just tolerate them.' "</TE>
<TE>   More Sherrod: Commenting on Phil Jackson's opinion that it's easy
to lose focus in baseball because it's such a boring game: "Rather
like a December NBA game, Coach?"</TE>
<TE>   Laboring for a cause: Lloyd Scott, 40, a former English
firefighter and a leukemia survivor, finally crossed the finish line
in the New York Marathon on Friday, five days after he started.
Wearing an antique, 130-pound deep-sea diving suit probably had
something to do with it.</TE>
<TE>   Scott told the New York Post, "It's a good example of what it's
like for cancer and leukemia sufferers because it's slow and painful
-- but, like me, they win out at the end."</TE>
<TE>   Conforming: Mike Bianchi in the Orlando Sentinel, on the NFL's
effect on Steve Spurrier: "They have taken one of the most
refreshing, rollicking college coaches in history and turned him into
just another NFL clone, just another NFL drone."</TE>
<TE>   Future shock: Reader Mark Hopping of San Leandro to the San
Francisco Chronicle: "Now Dusty Baker can give those toothpicks a
real workout, keeping his eye propped open while he watches another
dismal Cub season."</TE>
<TE>   Please leave: Bob Molinaro of the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot: "Don't
know whether Troy Aikman and the Dolphins will hook up, but I'd like
to see Joe Theismann make a comeback with the Redskins. It won't help
the team, but it would get him out of the ESPN booth."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Anthony Davis, two, against Notre Dame in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   Not trivial: Davis scored six touchdowns against the Irish in that
1972 game at the Coliseum, one in a 1973 loss at South Bend, Ind.,
then four more -- including the second-half kickoff return -- in the
Trojans' 55-24 victory in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: New York Knick guard Latrell Sprewell thinks too much
was made of his reporting late for games last season.</TE>
<TE>   He told reporters, "You're really talking 20-something games."</TE>
<TE>   Said Tom FitzGerald of the San Francisco Chronicle: "So it's not
like he did it a lot."</TE>

<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>When the moment came and it was time to take over the game, stashing
another victory in their bags before heading home from the season's
first trip, the Clippers were poised and efficient Tuesday in
knocking off the Miami Heat.</LD>
<LD>   Poised and efficient aren't normally associated with the Clippers,
but those were two excellent ways to describe their play while
turning a taut game into a laugher. Patient was another. Instead of
forcing the issue, the Clippers simply waited for the Heat to crack,
then seized control.</LD>
<LD>   A 24-1 run in the second half sent the Heat reeling and propelled
the Clippers to a 101-82 victory before 15,022 fans at American
Airlines Arena. A swarming zone defense helped the Clippers rally
from a 10-point deficit in the third quarter and earn a split on
their four-game trip.</LD>
<TE>   Elton Brand scored 25 points on 12-for-17 shooting and took 20
rebounds in 47 minutes for the Clippers (3-4). Michael Olowokandi
scored 19 points, including 17 in the second half. Andre Miller
scored 22 points, making 14 of 15 free throws, and had eight assists.
Corey Maggette scored 19 points and Eric Piatkowski had 13.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just an absolute collapse," Miami Coach Pat Riley said.
"We were playing the game just as well as we can play it. We were
very aggressive. [Then] we couldn't make the shot or the play. We
lost all of our aggressiveness and our movement when they slowed it
down offensively."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' defensive pressure in the second half was the
turning point, however. According to Coach Alvin Gentry, the Clippers
gave up only six baskets to the Heat in 30 possessions while playing
a 1-2-2 zone.</TE>
<TE>   The zone helped trigger the 24-1 run, which began with
Olowokandi's layup that cut Miami's lead to 65-59 with 3:28 remaining
in the third quarter. Olowokandi's nine-foot hook that gave the
Clippers an 81-66 lead with 9:01 left in the game capped the team's
best basketball so far this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Playing a zone has been the key for us," Olowokandi said.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers have used their zone in short bursts this season,
trying to catch the opposition off guard. They used it for most of
the second half against Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Forced to try to win the game from the outside, the Heat failed
miserably. Miami made 11 of 37 shots (29.7%) in the second half and
was outscored, 56-31.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very soft zone," Riley said. "The middle is wide open and
the ball has to get there. You have to make it collapse and then you
have to take what you can get."</TE>
<TE>   Miami overcame a sluggish start and led, 45-32, after Rasual
Butler's three-point basket with 3:42 left in the half. Butler led
Miami with 15 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers moved within 51-45 by halftime and gradually chipped
away at the lead. They went ahead to stay, 69-66, when Maggette
scored on a driving layup and made a free throw to complete a
three-point play with 42.8 seconds left in the third. Eddie Jones'
free throw was the only point the Heat managed during the Clippers'
run.</TE>
<TE>   "They got some shots, but they didn't knock them down," Brand said
after his first 20-20 game this season. "We have some athletic guys
that can contest the shot out of that zone and it changed the game
around."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the Clippers came within one Brand missed shot from
having a 3-1 trip against the Philadelphia 76ers, New Jersey Nets,
Orlando Magic and the Heat. Brand left a five-foot jumper short
against the 76ers and the Clippers lost, 101-99, in overtime to start
the trip.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers had a lead in the fourth quarter against New Jersey,
but the Nets rocketed away down the stretch. The Clippers stormed
back to defeat Orlando, then muzzled the Heat to complete an
encouraging trip.</TE>
<TE>   "We did all right," Maggette said. "These were games we were
capable of winning. I think we realized in the last two games that
our big men [Brand and Olowokandi] are our keys and we started
cutting down on our turnovers. We have to be consistent."</TE>

<HD>Richardson Will Rest</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MIAMI -- Quentin Richardson sprained his right knee while running
wind sprints on the fourth day of training camp in October. He
hyperextended the same knee during the Clippers' victory Nov. 3 over
the Detroit Pistons. He knocked his right knee against an
unidentified member of the New Jersey Nets on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Richardson, a guard who started the team's first two games before
returning to a reserve role, landed on the injured list Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers activated forward Tremaine Fowlkes to replace
Richardson, who must sit out at least five games, including Tuesday's
game against the Miami Heat. He is eligible to play again Nov. 20
against the Sacramento Kings at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   The Clippers hope the forced rest will enable Richardson to
recover fully. He hasn't been his usual explosive self since
suffering the original injury, which sidelined him for all but one of
the team's eight exhibitions.</TE>
<TE>   The second injury slowed him further and the third halted him.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers wished to point out that the three knee injuries are
unrelated.</TE>
<TE>   "What he needs to do is rest it and we'll see if that's" the
answer, Coach Alvin Gentry said of Richardson, who averaged 7.8
points (on 12-for-34 shooting) and 3.6 rebounds in 20.8 minutes in
five games this season.</TE>
<TE>   Fowlkes began the season on the injured list because of a sprained
right knee. He was in uniform Tuesday against the Heat but did not
play in the Clippers' 101-82 victory.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With Richardson sidelined, Gentry went with his starters almost
exclusively Tuesday, getting only three points from Keyon Dooling in
19 minutes. Marko Jaric did not score in eight minutes and Sean Rooks
was blanked in four minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not worried about getting scoring off our bench," Gentry
said, when asked about altering his normal rotation against Miami.
"Marko played great defense. Keyon played great defense."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers will take today off after flying cross-country from
Miami late Tuesday night. They begin a stretch of four games in five
nights Thursday against the Orlando Magic at Staples Center. The
Clippers defeated the Magic, 120-117, Sunday afternoon at Orlando.</TE>

<HD>Tverdovsky Likes Being a Devil</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Former Mighty Duck defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky is alive and well and
playing in New Jersey.</LD>
<LD>   Tverdovsky was hardly surprised when he was traded to the Devils
this summer. He has adjusted nicely, playing for a franchise that has
made the playoffs 13 of the last 15 seasons, which includes Stanley
Cup championships in 1995 and 2000.</LD>
<LD>   "I like it here," said Tverdovsky, who had an assist in the
Devils' 3-2 overtime victory over the Ducks on Tuesday. "I see a real
chance to win here. They have won the Cup here and there is no reason
we can't do it again."</LD>
<TE>   Tverdovsky was sent to the Devils in a six-player trade that
landed Petr Sykora in Anaheim. Tverdovsky had two tours of duty with
the Ducks and was a key part of their last playoff team in 1998-99.</TE>
<TE>   He was expecting the trade after Bryan Murray was elevated from
coach to general manager last spring.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know how to react," said Tverdovsky, who has no goals
and six assists this season. "On one hand, this is a chance to win
right now and I'm really excited about that. On the other hand, I
really wanted Anaheim to become a competitive team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Ducks Tverdovsky, Jeff Friesen and Jim McKenzie all had
assists for the Devils on Tuesday. All were traded by the Ducks to
New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Leclerc had elbow surgery and will rejoin the team in
Columbus tonight. He suffered a torn bursa sac in his elbow during
Sunday's game.</TE>
<TE>   Leclerc may not miss any more games. He was called "questionable"
by Duck officials for the game against the Blue Jackets on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I sure expect him to play," Coach Mike Babcock said. "I thought
he should have played [Tuesday], but they don't let me make those
decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Leclerc missed 11 games in the 1999-2000 season because of a
similar injury in his left elbow that became infected.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duck goalie Martin Gerber, who returned to Switzerland to see his
ailing mother, will meet the Ducks in Columbus today. He is expected
to play for minor league Cincinnati on Friday before rejoining the
team.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Caught on the Rebound</HD>
<DH>They blow two-goal lead in third period, then lose to
Devils, 3-2, on Langenbrunner's goal off ricochet in overtime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>This was OK ... really.</LD>
<LD>   After New Jersey's Jamie Langenbrunner banged home a rebound for a
3-2 overtime victory Tuesday, the Mighty Ducks were left in the
basement of the Continental Airlines Arena contemplating the yin and
the yang.</LD>
<LD>   They battled and came away with a point against the New Jersey
Devils, so high-fives all around.</LD>
<TE>   Of course ...</TE>
<TE>   They collapsed, letting a 2-0 third-period lead get away in a
matter of seconds. They then let the game get away when Langenbrunner
scored his second goal of the game to send the announced 15,043 home
relieved.</TE>
<TE>   "This [stinks]," Duck forward Kevin Sawyer said. "We expect to win
every game. It's not just guys saying that now. We really feel that
way."</TE>
<TE>   So in the silver-lining department, the Ducks made their purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Their three-game winning streak ended. But was that all bad? After
all, their last four road games have resulted in points, including
victories at Boston and Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to see that our guys are frustrated," Coach Mike
Babcock said. "At the start of the season, if you'd told these guys
we'd get a point in New Jersey, they would have done cartwheels. Now
they are starting to think they might be good. I think it is a real
positive thing."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that will be determined more on Thursday, when the
Ducks play at Columbus, where they are 0-4. But the early returns
were in favor of the Ducks, with the Ducks tabulating.</TE>
<TE>   "The key for me is we got a great lesson and we got a point,"
Babcock said. "We didn't sneak a point out of here. We dominated a
lot of the game, really dominated. Yet you would liked to close the
door on it."</TE>
<TE>   The door seemed slammed when the Ducks' Marc Chouinard stripped
Scott Niedermayer of the puck at center ice, headed into the Devil
zone and fired a shot that went off goalie Martin Brodeur's arm pit
and into the net.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks had a 2-0 lead six minutes 54 seconds into the third
period. Then things fell apart for them.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we got the two-goal lead, it was almost like we were
satisfied with it," goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere said. "New Jersey
knows what it takes to win. They kept playing hard and good things
happened to them."</TE>
<TE>   Exhibit A in that case took 29 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Langenbrunner chipped in a Jim McKenzie pass at 7:49, ending
Giguere's shutout streak at 131:37. Then Jeff Friesen passed to Scott
Gomez on the wing. Gomez fired a shot past Giguere to tie the score
at 8:18.</TE>
<TE>   In overtime, Scott Stevens burst into the Duck zone and fired a
shot that bounced off Giguere.</TE>
<TE>   Langenbrunner raced past defenseman Keith Carney and hit the
rebound into the open net.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought [Giguere] froze the puck," Carney said. "I was just
trying to stay with [Langenbrunner], but I thought the play was over.
He did a good job getting his stick on it."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks have been this way before, most recently when they blew
a 3-1 third-period lead against Edmonton and lost, 4-3, in regulation
Oct. 26.</TE>
<TE>   This one, though, was different, the Ducks said, beyond the fact
that they managed a point in the first game of a five-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   "In Edmonton, we were still trying to find our identity," Carney
said. "We expect to win. We are confident every night."</TE>
<TE>   Which wouldn't change from one game, was the unanimous opinion in
the Duck dressing room.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it almost goes the other way," Babcock said. "Tonight, we
come in here to play the Mighty New Jersey Devils and we found out we
might be mighty too."</TE>

<LD>Stan Hill, starting in place of injured Byron Leftwich, threw four
touchdown passes and scored on a one-yard run with five seconds left
to lift Marshall over Miami of Ohio, 36-34, in a Mid-American
Conference game Tuesday night at Huntington, W.Va.</LD>
<LD>   After the game, Miami defensive coordinator John Wauford was
arrested after allegedly shoving a Marshall fan.</LD>
<LD>   The fan, Robert A. Flaugher of Pickerington, Ohio, hit his head on
the artificial turf. He was taken on a stretcher to St. Mary's
Medical Center and was in stable condition with a concussion.</LD>
<TE>   Wauford was charged with battery, a misdemeanor. He was
transported to Cabell County Magistrate Court and posted bail.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall (7-2, 5-1) can win its sixth consecutive East Division
title with a victory over Ohio on Nov. 23. The East Division winner
will host the conference championship game on Dec. 7. Miami (7-4,
5-2) lost to Marshall for the fifth consecutive time.</TE>

<TE>   "I don't ever use the front door -- I go in the garage," Paterno
said. "I have one of those things, you know, you push the button and
the garage door goes up. That's what I use."</TE>

<HD>Showdown in West Valley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The game has been in the sights of both teams for weeks now, and
while they could have overlooked other West Valley League opponents,
Woodland Hills Taft and Lake Balboa Birmingham followed the
one-game-at-a-time approach.</LD>
<LD>   And so, after beating up everybody else, the game that means
everything--at least so far in the season--for both teams is finally
here.</LD>
<LD>   Taft (9-0, 4-0) plays at Birmingham (7-2, 4-0) on Friday night to
determine the West Valley champion and, quite possibly, the top
seeding for the City Section playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   "This is just a stepping stone for us," said Taft Coach Troy
Starr, putting the game into perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to downplay this game. This is a huge game for both
of us at this point of the season. But our goal is the playoffs and
then the City championship. That's the biggest game of the year."</TE>
<TE>   It has been a two-team show in the West Valley League. Taft has
outscored league opponents by an average of 43.8 points; Birmingham
by a 41-point average.</TE>
<TE>   The Toreadors, No. 5 in The Times' rankings, have been the title
favorite from the season's start and have shown no sign of buckling
under pressure. Their offense -- loaded with some of the top skill
players in Southern California -- has averaged a section-best 43.4
points.</TE>
<TE>   But it is an improved defense that could help Taft players hoist
their first section trophy in four years.</TE>
<TE>   Led by senior linebacker Lance Broadus and a secondary that
features Steve Smith and brothers Paul and Mike Pratt, the Toreadors
have five shutouts. New defensive coordinator Sean Pollard has helped
tighten up that side of the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Starr said a 55-34 victory over San Fernando on Oct. 11 got his
team's attention. The score was tied at 34-34 in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "We just went to sleep that game," he said. "You win championships
with defense. When we've had great teams it's because we had a great
defense that year."</TE>
<TE>   Birmingham can make a strong case for being the City's second-best
team -- if not its best after Friday. The Patriots' losses have come
against two unbeaten Southern Section powers, Sherman Oaks Notre Dame
and Newhall Hart. They have soundly beaten the rest, including an
impressive 38-14 victory at San Pedro in Week 2.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, everybody has talked about this [game] since the
summer," said Ed Croson, Birmingham's third-year coach. "We did a
good job of keeping our focus on the task at hand."</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots have had Taft's number the last two seasons, posting
41-14 and 40-21 victories after not beating the Toreadors since 1983.
In those wins, Birmingham forced 10 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "They're formidable," Starr said. "They shouldn't have lost to
[Notre Dame and Hart]. With that talent they've had, they should have
been in the Coliseum last year."</TE>
<TE>   Croson said, however, that two victories doesn't give them much of
an edge.</TE>
<TE>   "It is going to make us a lot more calm about the game," he said.
"We're confident but we're very respectful of their speed. You'd be
crazy not to be."</TE>
<TE>   The two agree that this may not be their only meeting of the
season. The last time two San Fernando Valley teams faced each other
in the City championship game was in 1970, when Granada Hills
defeated San Fernando.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a real possibility," Starr said of a title-game matchup.
"But I know Carson and Crenshaw have improved dramatically over the
season.</TE>
<TE>   "Year in and year out, if you want to win the City title, you've
got to beat the teams over that hill."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The playoff seeding meeting is Saturday morning and the most
difficult chore may be finding 16 teams worthy of being in the
Championship bracket.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a breakdown of which teams will be in the bracket:</TE>
<TE>   * Certain: Taft, Birmingham, Carson, Van Nuys Grant, Roosevelt,
Franklin, Venice, Sylmar, Crenshaw, Fremont, San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   * Fairly certain: Dorsey, Wilmington Banning.</TE>
<TE>   * Not-so-certain: Fairfax, Eagle Rock, Jefferson, Granada Hills,
Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   There are cases to be made that some of the "not-so-certain" teams
don't deserve to be included in the main bracket, but if Fairfax,
Eagle Rock and Jefferson pull off victories this week, they will get
in. Fairfax plays at Venice, Eagle Rock plays host to Franklin and
Jefferson plays host to Fremont.</TE>
<TE>   Banning (4-5) would appear to need a victory over Carson on
Thursday, but a loss shouldn't relegate the Pilots to the
invitational bracket because of their strong schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Granada Hills (6-3) and Wilson (6-3) are better suited for the
invitational playoffs but could get one of the final championship
slots with a victory this week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks ago, defending City champion Dorsey was in the middle
of a disastrous season. The Dons had to forfeit their season-opening
victory over Sylmar and had fallen to 1-5 with a shocking loss to
Locke.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, however, they have looked like the team that has been
a perennial section powerhouse.</TE>
<TE>   With victories over Jefferson, Manual Arts and Fremont, Dorsey
(4-5, 3-1) can gain a share of the Coliseum League championship with
a victory over Crenshaw.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   City top 10: 1. Taft (9-0); 2. Birmingham (7-2); 3. Carson (7-2);
4. Venice (7-2); 5. Crenshaw (6-3); 6. Roosevelt (8-1); 7. Franklin
(8-1); 8. Gardena (6-3); 9. Sylmar (7-2); 10. San Pedro (5-4).</TE>

<LD>   Bellflower St. John Bosco (7-2, 4-0) vs. Santa Ana Mater Dei (7-2,
3-1) at Santa Ana Stadium, 7 p.m., Thursday</LD>
<LD>   St. John Bosco will win its first Serra League title if it defeats
Mater Dei, which fell victim to poor special teams play in a 19-0
loss to Santa Margarita last week. The Monarchs failed to get off one
punt and had another blocked. Mater Dei seemed to be peaking before
its loss, having won six games in convincing fashion since losing to
Mission Viejo in Week 2. St. John Bosco, ranked No. 8 by The Times,
is riding a six-game winning streak after beating Anaheim Servite,
24-20, last week. Derrick Williams had 79 yards in 12 carries for the
Braves, who seek their first league title since winning the Del Rey
League in 1986. Ninth-ranked Mater Dei last won the Serra League in
1999.</LD>
<TE>   -- Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   La Verne Damien (7-2, 2-1) at Chino Hills Ayala (8-1, 3-0), 7
p.m., Thursday</TE>
<TE>   The scuttlebutt before the season was that newcomer Chino would
sweep through the Sierra League with ease. Ayala took care of that
two weeks ago with a 21-14 victory over the Cowboys. Now, the
Bulldogs, ranked No. 10 by The Times, can clinch a league title the
same way they did last year -- by beating Damien, ranked No. 22.
Justin Wolfchief, who scored two first-quarter touchdowns in last
season's 24-8 victory, may be gone, but the Bulldogs can rely on
running backs Robert Meza, Steven Toliver and Corey Tello. Damien's
most potent offensive weapons are quarterback Nick Davila and running
back Ian Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   -- Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   Ventura Buena (8-1, 4-0) vs. Ventura St. Bonaventure (8-1, 4-0) at
Ventura High, 7:30 p.m., Thursday</TE>
<TE>   A victory by St. Bonaventure, ranked No. 12 by The Times, would
make it the Channel League champion in its inaugural season in the
Division IV league. A Buena victory would give the Bulldogs their
fifth league title in six years. "It's just a championship game every
young man should get a chance to play in," Buena Coach Rick Scott
said when asked if the game was extra significant because it was
against a St. Bonaventure team that won the previous three Division
XI championships. Buena will be led by Alex Garfio, who has rushed
for 1,772 yards and scored 23 touchdowns in 223 carries. Whitney
Lewis of St. Bonaventure, one of the most heavily recruited players
in the nation, has rushed for 553 yards in 67 carries, caught 42
passes for 783 yards and scored 23 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   -- John Ortega</TE>
<TE>   Hacienda Heights Los Altos (7-2, 2-1) at La Verne Bonita (5-3,
3-0), 7:30 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Bonita's defense is allowing a Miramonte League-best nine points
per game. Statistically, it is going up against the league's best
offense in Los Altos, which is averaging 34.3 points behind backfield
mates Daniel Drayton and Randall Brown, who have combined for 29
touchdowns, and quarterback Carlos Ordonez, who has passed for 17
touchdowns. Bonita, formerly in the Valle Vista League, has
positioned itself to end four years of domination by Los Altos, which
is trying to win its third title in five years, and Covina Charter
Oak. Los Altos is ranked No. 17 by The Times and No. 1 in Division
VI; Bonita is unranked, despite a muddy 14-7 victory over Covina
Charter Oak.</TE>
<TE>   -- Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   Westlake Village Westlake (7-2, 6-0) at Moorpark (9-0, 6-0), 7
p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark could win its first Marmonte League championship in its
fifth year in the league. The No. 21 Musketeers have been crushing
teams with their defense and their offense has had its moments,
outscoring league opponents, 236-61. Cliff Cardwell had a
school-record 292 yards rushing in a 35-7 victory over Agoura on Nov.
1. Westlake has rebounded since getting thumped by Sherman Oaks Notre
Dame and Newhall Hart in consecutive weeks, winning six consecutive
league games and outscoring Marmonte League teams, 190-73.</TE>
<TE>   -- Mike Bresnahan</TE>
<TE>   Antelope Valley (8-1, 4-0) at Palmdale (8-1, 3-1), 7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Antelope Valley is trying to win its third consecutive Golden
League title against a team it defeated last season, 24-14. The No.
23 Antelopes have allowed more than 13 points only once this season
-- a 21-19 loss to Los Angeles Loyola. Palmdale's defense has also
been stellar, allowing 13.5 points per game. It will have its hands
full against the triple-option attack of Johnny Walker, Kreig Peters
and Sean Wallace. Walker has rushed for 993 yards and 13 touchdowns
and has passed for four more. Peters has rushed for 778 yards and 11
touchdowns, and Wallace has rushed for 535 yards and four touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   -- Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   CITY SECTION</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills Taft (9-0, 4-0) at Lake Balboa Birmingham (7-2,
4-0), 7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   This West Valley League title matchup could determine the No.
1-seeded team for the City Section playoffs. Unbeaten Taft, ranked
No. 5 by The Times, has lost to Birmingham the last two years because
of its failure to stop the Patriots' rushing attack. But the
Toreadors have five shutouts this season, allowed only seven points
in league play and haven't permitted a running back to surpass 100
yards. Birmingham's losses have come against unbeaten Sherman Oaks
Notre Dame and Newhall Hart. Running back Dennis Keyes rushed for 216
yards and had a 96-yard touchdown reception last season against Taft.</TE>

<HD>Westchester Is Put on Probation Again</HD>
<DH>Athletic director barred from two boys' basketball games.
Carson official says penalties are too lenient.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second time in two years, Westchester High was placed on
athletic probation for one year because of violations committed by
its boys' basketball team.</LD>
<LD>   Westchester violated a California Interscholastic Federation rule
preventing contact with a student before he enrolled at the school, a
City Section rules committee found Tuesday. As part of the
punishment, its athletic director is barred from attending the
Comets' first two Western League games.</LD>
<LD>   Westchester Athletic Director Brian Henderson admitted to the
committee that he spoke with the father of former Carson player Ray
Reese before Reese officially enrolled at Westchester, a violation of
a CIF rule that forbids communication between athletic department
members and a transfer student's parents before completion of the
enrollment process.</LD>
<TE>   The committee voted, 7-0, with one abstention, to put the Comets
on probation.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence was clear," City Section Commissioner Barbara Fiege
said.</TE>
<TE>   The committee, however, did not find evidence Tuesday of
recruiting or undue influence violations by Westchester, more serious
transgressions that are typically difficult to prove.</TE>
<TE>   Carson administrators said the penalties were not stiff enough.</TE>
<TE>   Rosie Martinez, assistant principal at Carson, said banning the
Comets from the playoffs "would have been the only way to send a
clear, definitive message to everyone."</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope that putting them on probation is something they're
not going to chuckle at and continue to do things the way they've
been done," Martinez said. "I sincerely hope that Westchester does
abide by the rules and policies that we all have to live by."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Westchester was placed on probation for one year because
former guard Hassan Adams, star of the Comets' state-champion team
last season, played for Westchester in a summer tournament while
still officially enrolled at Los Angeles Verbum Dei.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the rules committee determined in a specially convened
session that two players -- Reese and Gabriel Pruitt -- had provided
false information in transferring to Westchester. Reese, a sophomore
forward, and Pruitt, a junior guard from Compton Centennial, were
suspended from athletic competition for one year because they had
fabricated addresses. The players might challenge the ruling before a
section appeals committee.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's committee meeting was fueled by allegations from
Carson administrators that Westchester committed multiple violations
in the transfer of Reese, who last season distinguished himself as
one of the best young forwards in the section.</TE>
<TE>   Carson administrators said Reese's father, Ray Reese Sr., was
coached by Henderson on how to get his son legally transferred to
Westchester.</TE>
<TE>   Reese was denied a transfer on three occasions -- twice by school
officials and then by the district that has jurisdiction over Carson
-- before his father filed for an official change of residence.</TE>
<TE>   Carson challenged whether Reese resided at the given address, an
allegation supported by a Westchester counselor who deemed Reese's
claimed address to be unsatisfactory.</TE>
<TE>   As further penalty, the committee told Westchester administrators
to submit a written analysis on how to prevent future transgressions.</TE>
<TE>   Henderson, who is also an assistant basketball coach, is banned
from attending Westchester's league games on Dec. 9 at Los Angeles
High and on Jan. 14 at Fairfax.</TE>
<TE>   Westchester defeated Los Angeles High twice last season by a
combined 78 points, and defeated Fairfax three times in four
tension-filled games, including the City Section championship.</TE>

<LD>The transition from Philippe Boucher to Andreas Lilja has not
proceeded as seamlessly as the Kings probably would have hoped.</LD>
<LD>   The Swedish defenseman, penciled in as the replacement when
Boucher signed with the Dallas Stars as an unrestricted free agent
last summer, has been scratched from the last four games after having
played in the first 12, replaced in the lineup by Chris McAlpine or
Brad Norton.</LD>
<LD>   "I think he expected more from himself," Coach Andy Murray said
before Tuesday night's game against the Toronto Maple Leafs. "I still
expect him to play good."</LD>
<TE>   But Lilja, 27, has some work ahead of him, the coach added.</TE>
<TE>   "He needs to move his feet, he needs to move the puck and he needs
to move people," Murray said. "He needs to be a mover. In other
words, he can skate better, he can pass better and he can be more
physical....</TE>
<TE>   "I think he needs to be smarter in his game, more assertive in his
game -- all things that we've told him. That's why he's had to sit
and watch. He's got to be better."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mikko Eloranta, who the Kings feared could be sidelined for six
weeks after suffering a left knee injury Nov. 5, flew to Vancouver on
Tuesday to join the club and is expected to be activated for Thursday
night's game against the Canucks.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Belanger, who suffered a concussion in the same game in which
Eloranta was injured, will be put on injured reserve to open a roster
spot for Eloranta.</TE>

<HD>The Point Is, Kings Are Happy With Effort</HD>
<DH>Toronto wins, 4-3, on Sundin's overtime goal, but Murray is
pleased with performance after L.A. overcomes three-goal deficit in
third period.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Descending upon a town in a tizzy this week, the Kings were asked
repeatedly about the plight of the Toronto Maple Leafs, whose flurry
of early-season losses has sunk them near the bottom in the Eastern
Conference.</LD>
<LD>   Their response: What do we care?</LD>
<LD>   As the Kings showed Tuesday night in spotting the Maple Leafs an
early three-goal advantage in a 4-3 overtime loss in front of a
sellout crowd of 19,225 at the Air Canada Centre, they've got their
own problems.</LD>
<TE>   The loss was their fourth in five games and their fifth in seven,
two in overtime, since scoring leader Jason Allison was sidelined
last month.</TE>
<TE>   Ziggy Palffy hasn't scored a goal since the opener, goaltender
Felix Potvin gave up three first-period goals for the second
consecutive game and Allison, sidelined because of a knee injury,
isn't due back until late December at the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   But the Kings, who boarded a 5 1/2-hour flight to Vancouver after
the game, weren't about to look unkindly on an overtime loss for
which they gladly accepted a point in the standings by overcoming a
3-0 third-period deficit.</TE>
<TE>   So what if Mats Sundin scored his second goal of the game 3
minutes 20 seconds into the extra period, giving the Maple Leafs the
victory?</TE>
<TE>   It meant little to the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely nothing bittersweet about it at all," Coach Andy
Murray said. "We have to feel good about ourselves. I'm proud of our
level of determination to come back. We were not playing a poor game
when we were down, 3-0....</TE>
<TE>   "And what we showed in the third period is an example to our team
of what we're capable of and how we have to play, so I want our
players walking out of here and getting on that plane feeling good
about themselves."</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of Potvin, who gave up three goals on only five
shots in the first period and was pulled in favor of Jamie Storr
after the second, they did.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we showed a lot of fortitude coming back, a lot of
courage," defenseman Mathieu Schneider said. "It's something that we
haven't had to do this year. The games we played well and won, we
played with the lead for the most part, so I think this is a step in
the right direction for us."</TE>
<TE>   The first period was a step into the recent past, the Kings
digging themselves the same 3-0 hole they'd dug Saturday night in a
3-1 loss at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   After Sundin scored at 3:45 and Jonas Hoglund at 11:27, the Maple
Leafs led, 2-0, after taking only two shots. When Tomas Kaberle
scored on the Maple Leafs' fifth shot at 18:52, a regulation loss for
the Kings seemed almost inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   "But it wasn't like Montreal, where the effort wasn't there,"
Schneider said. "It was just a couple of mistakes that cost us. It
was a much different situation."</TE>
<TE>   In the second period, Potvin stopped 13 shots and in the third,
when the Kings' own marksmanship improved, Storr stopped five.</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Jaroslav Modry's sixth goal in seven games cut the
deficit to 3-1 at 2:36 of the third period. Adam Deadmarsh scored his
eighth goal at 7:39. Then, with Tom Fitzgerald of the Maple Leafs in
the penalty box for obstruction holding, Deadmarsh scored his ninth,
a power-play goal at 14:47.</TE>
<TE>   The end of the period was greeted with boos from the crowd, which
was in a much better mood after Sundin scored on a rebound of his own
shot.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings were OK with that.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to get as many points as we can on the road," said
Schneider, looking ahead to four more games on this eight-game trip.
"It's been a tough schedule, but we came out in the third period and
played the way we wanted to play.</TE>
<TE>   "We were really on a full-court press that whole period. It's a
little riskier hockey, but you're going to create more chances and
that's what happened for us."</TE>

<KH>LAKER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Samake Is Suspended Because of Steroid Tests</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laker center Soumaila Samake was suspended for five games Tuesday
because he violated the terms of the league's steroids policy, two
positive tests Samake and the team claimed resulted from an
over-the-counter supplement he ingested this summer.</LD>
<LD>   Though the Lakers were short Shaquille O'Neal and Mark Madsen
along their front line, and have Robert Horry and Samaki Walker
suffering from minor injuries, Samake played only 48 minutes in seven
games, and four minutes in the last two. He averaged 2.7 points and
2.3 rebounds.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement released by his Florida-based agent, Samake said he
tested for nandrolone, a steroid. He maintained that an "extensive"
workout and nutritional program had included a supplement that
contained the steroid, though he claimed nandrolone was not listed as
an ingredient on the supplement's package.</LD>
<TE>   Samake, a 7-foot, 245-pound native of Mali, will be eligible to
return against the Chicago Bulls on Nov. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson said Tuesday the club knew Samake would test
positive with the league, and warned the league of it, though team
officials believed it would be for a banned substance listed among
the supplement's ingredients, and not nandrolone. Apparently, the
supplement had been recommended by a trainer in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Jackson said, evidence of a questionable supplement arose
during a training camp physical, at which point team officials told
Samake to show them the product. The team then notified the league of
the possible problem. A second test, perhaps two weeks after the
first, confirmed the finding of nandrolone.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he feels bad," O'Neal said. "It's an honest mistake. It's
a guy trying to get strong because he knows I'm going to bust his
[butt] every day.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't know. He's a foreigner. I forgive him."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had presumed a suspension -- unpaid -- for Samake, but,
Jackson said, "We thought it might be a game."</TE>
<TE>   "It's such an obtuse thing," Jackson said. "There's so many things
going on right know, that I think it was difficult to ferret it out.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a rule. You have to execute the rule. We agree with the
suspension.... Unfortunately, it's a player that has limited
capabilities, what we would call a marginal player, so it's
unfortunate."</TE>
<TE>   Violation of the steroid policy, however, brings an automatic
five-game suspension. General Manager Mitch Kupchak said he felt
badly for Samake, whose grasp of English is limited.</TE>
<TE>   "The net that was set up to catch violators, this was not its
intended victim," Kupchak said. "He's a victim of the system."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal will be examined by Dr. Robert Mohr today. Tuesday's
examination was put off a day.... Jackson's longest losing streak as
a coach is five games, from Feb. 26-March 6, 1994, with the Chicago
Bulls.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Still Have a Big Wait to Lift</HD>
<DH>Another cold start turns into 95-83 setback to Hawks,
marking L.A.'s first four-game losing streak under Jackson.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inside of a minute left, Staples Center emptied, quietly. A few of
the remaining 18,997 booed, but that wasn't the prevailing emotion.</LD>
<LD>   Just, you know, nothing. Just, waiting.</LD>
<LD>   Waiting for Shaquille O'Neal. Waiting for the four-peat to start.
For something.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers lost, 95-83, to the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday night, and
so, two weeks into their season, they are tied for last in the
Pacific Division. They have lost four in a row for the first time in
more than three seasons under Phil Jackson. They are 2-6, standing
shoulder to shoulder with the dreadful Golden State Warriors, who
will be here for the showdown Friday, and playing the part.</TE>
<TE>   Shareef Abdur-Rahim scored 26 points and Jason Terry scored 21 for
the Hawks. Kobe Bryant scored 21 points, but he didn't score in the
fourth quarter, missed 14 of 22 field-goal attempts, and the Lakers
shot 34% from the floor, terribly inaccurate again.</TE>
<TE>   Starters Bryant, Rick Fox, Robert Horry, Samaki Walker and Derek
Fisher combined to shoot 20 for 69.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Shaw scored 17 points, 12 in the fourth quarter, and made
five of six three-point shots as the Lakers tried to claw back.</TE>
<TE>   For the fourth consecutive game, they trailed by at least 17
points. Two previous deficits, in Boston and Washington, had been
recovered, though the victories were not. Against the Hawks, after
trailing 72-55 with more than four minutes remaining in the third
quarter, the Lakers came within 77-75, a 20-5 run, finally on a Shaw
three-pointer. And then the Lakers began to miss again, and the Hawks
finished by scoring 13 of the final 18 points.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow," Jackson said, "we were really pathetic out there."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Bryant emerged from the trainers' room, a tiny round
bandage on one corner of his mouth, a crooked smile on the other.</TE>
<TE>   "I was furious, I was ready to kick somebody's you know what,"
Bryant said. "And I'm in the training room and [conditioning coach]
Jim Cotta is holding his little daughter [Greer]. I don't know how
old she is, but she's the cutest thing in the world. It just put
things in perspective. I swear to God, I'm not even upset anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, the truth of the matter is, we're playing bad. We need to
make shots that are very makable shots. We're not making them. Some
guys need to find their jump shots, and they will. They'll come
around. But, what doesn't break you makes you stronger. So, this is a
period where we really find out a lot about ourselves and come out
the next game and play our hardest and see if we can win that one."</TE>
<TE>   Early in the game, before many of the various injured Lakers
shuffled in through the tunnel, Jackson could look to his right and
make out Slava Medvedenko, Tracy Murray and Shaw, each separated by
at least one chair.</TE>
<TE>   On the floor, the rookies -- Kareem Rush and Jannero Pargo --
reclined on their elbows along the baseline.</TE>
<TE>   Of Jackson's 14, two -- O'Neal and Mark Madsen -- are on the
injured list, one -- Devean George -- has ankles so sore he might as
well be, and another -- reserve center Soumaila Samake -- served the
first of a five-game suspension for violating the league's steroid
policy. He had 10 available players.</TE>
<TE>   Still, before the game, in another Shaq moment, O'Neal sought to
quell unrest brought on by five defeats in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   "It can't get any worse for us," he said. "It's only going to make
us stronger. Real life will be back soon. This is all just a
terrible, bad dream."</TE>
<TE>   He laughed a big, thick November laugh.</TE>
<TE>   And then the Lakers made five of 26 field-goal attempts in the
first quarter (19.2%) and scored 17 points. At the end of three days
off, back in their own gym after their first 0-3 trip in seven years,
the Lakers had their worst shooting quarter of the season, which
bled, slowly, brick by brick, into their worst shooting half (28.8 %)
of the season.</TE>
<TE>   They went to halftime having made 15 of 52 shots, having mystified
a crowd already not sure what to think in O'Neal's absence, and
having been unable to stop Abdur-Rahim, who scored 20 points before
the half.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Hawks, who had lost three in a row on the road -- in
Phoenix, Utah and Sacramento -- and have played one home game in
November, scored the first 12 points of the third quarter, and led,
57-40. In the same span, the Lakers took only three shots.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Cold as Ice</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' 2-6 start can be attributed in part to poor shooting;
In four of their losses, they failed to break the 40% mark from the
field. Their scoring and shooting in six losses:</TE>

<LD>A painful third-quarter fall couldn't stop Steve Francis.</LD>
<LD>   Francis got up slowly from the spill but was going strong by the
fourth quarter as he scored Houston's final 16 points and led the
Rockets over the visiting Portland Trail Blazers, 86-83, Tuesday
night.</LD>
<LD>   "It was over-exaggerated," Francis said. "I got up. As long as I
get up, I'm OK. It's just something that happened."</LD>
<TE>   Francis, who scored 18 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter,
made a layup with 20 seconds left to put the Rockets ahead to stay,
85-83, and closed it out with a free throw.</TE>
<TE>   Rasheed Wallace's three-point shot with 3.3 seconds to play missed
and Eddie Griffin rebounded for the Rockets, ending the game.</TE>
<TE>   Francis fell hard under Houston's basket with 4:43 left in the
third quarter after a flagrant foul from Wallace. Francis remained in
the game but took heat treatments on his lower back during each
timeout.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a warrior, there was no doubt in my mind if he could walk,
he was going to play," Rocket Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. "He had
those headaches all last year and fought through them. He's a tough
guy."</TE>
<TE>   Yao Ming played 15 minutes for the Rockets and scored seven points
with four rebounds, two assists and a blocked shot.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 115, Orlando 109 -- Jerome Williams scored a career-high
30 points as the injury-riddled Raptors rallied from a 14-point
deficit at Orlando, Fla. Williams' layup with 57.8 seconds remaining
broke a tie at 109.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto was without starters Vince Carter (strained left
quadriceps tendon), Antonio Davis (strained left ribcage muscle) and
Lamond Murray (torn ligament in right foot).</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 101, Washington 95 -- Rashard Lewis scored a career-high
37 points, and the SuperSonics withstood a late rally led by Michael
Jordan at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan scored 10 of the last 14 points for the Wizards, who cut an
11-point fourth-quarter deficit to one before Lewis, Predrag Drobnjak
and Brent Barry made big shots to seal the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan scored a season-high 27 points on 13-for-22 shooting in 31
minutes. Lewis was 16 for 19 from the field.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 108, New York 87 -- In a game that further exposed one of the
Knicks' many weaknesses, the Jazz's point guards controlled the game
as the Knicks played their second straight game without the injured
Charlie Ward at New York.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Jackson had six points, three assists and three rebounds in
the second quarter when matched against rookie Frank Williams, and
Utah outscored New York, 26-12, in the period to take a 48-30
halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   John Stockton had 10 of his 12 points and four of his seven
assists in the third as Utah went ahead by as many as 30.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 93, New Orleans 87 -- Chucky Atkins returned to the
starting lineup with 20 points to lead the Pistons at Auburn Hills,
Mich. Atkins, last year's starter at point guard, played in place of
the suspended Chauncey Billups.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 95, Cleveland 75 -- Ron Artest scored 22 points to lead
the Pacers at Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Ricky Davis, who averages 23.4 points for the Cavaliers, was
benched six minutes into the game and did not return for the start of
the second half.</TE>
<TE>   After coming out of the game, Davis put on his warmups, draped a
towel over his back and didn't join the Cavaliers in the huddle
during timeouts, instead standing off to the side with his hands in
his pockets and looking around.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Memphis Grizzlies brought back Hubie Brown from the broadcast
booth, picking him to coach the NBA's only winless team after Sidney
Lowe resigned Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Jerry West, Memphis' president of basketball operations, called
the 69-year-old Brown "the consummate teacher" and said the Turner
Sports analyst was exactly what the young Grizzlies need.</LD>
<LD>   Brown was scheduled to join the 0-8 Grizzlies today. Memphis' next
game is Friday night against Minnesota.</LD>
<TE>   "He sounds like a teenager rearing for his first date," West said.</TE>
<TE>   West declined to give details of Brown's contract with Memphis
except to say "it's for more than one year." Brown last coached in
the NBA in the 1986-87 season with the New York Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe's resignation came the day after the Grizzlies lost to Golden
State, 108-101, at home.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish the team well," Lowe said in a statement. "The Grizzlies
have some good, young talent here, and they are going to be good in
the future."</TE>
<TE>   The Grizzlies have been among the worst NBA teams recently, going
23-59 in each of the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   West said the resignation was Lowe's idea.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Sidney was frustrated with the way we were playing,
frustrated with the results. I think in his mind he thought it was in
his best interest and in the team's best interest to resign," West
said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown spent 10 seasons coaching in the NBA with the Knicks and the
Atlanta Hawks.</TE>

<HD>Knight Takes Indiana to Court</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Knight is suing Indiana University, alleging he lost more than $2
million in income since being fired by the school two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Knight contends he was fired without cause, without a proper
meeting of university trustees and without a chance to defend
himself.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit was filed in the Monroe County Circuit Court on Friday
after talks between his lawyers and the school collapsed. Under state
law, the former Hoosier men's basketball coach had until Tuesday to
take legal action.</LD>
<TE>   Knight was fired Sept. 10, 2000, by university President Myles
Brand, and gave Indiana notice in early 2001 that he might sue.</TE>
<TE>   The school denied Knight's allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "The university has fulfilled all of its obligations under the
contract it had with Mr. Knight. Indiana University will defend its
interests vigorously," the university said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney have said a key issue in the talks is whether Indiana
should pay Knight for lost income -- and how much.</TE>
<TE>   Russell Yates, Knight's attorney, said Knight filed the lawsuit
because he believes the university breached the contract by firing
him and costing him compensation.</TE>
<TE>   The university paid Knight under the conditions of his contract,
but the coach lost income that was directly dependent on the
agreement, including money derived from television and radio
programs, a basketball camp, a shoe contract and other endorsements,
the lawsuit said.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Knight would not have gone into litigation for fun," Yates
said. "He would not like this distraction, but we feel very clearly
that he is owed money under the contract."</TE>
<TE>   Knight spent 29 seasons at Indiana and won three national titles.
He became men's coach at Texas Tech six months after being fired from
Indiana.</TE>

<TE>   Arizona teammates Luke Walton and Jason Gardner were among the

<TE>   Drew Nicholas scored 32 points and Tahj Holden had 22, and No. 13

<TE>   The Globetrotters made a name for themselves with their madcap
antics against hand-picked opponents, but over the last three years
have played serious basketball in exhibition games against college
teams. They are 13-4 in those games.</TE>

me to dedicate my time to my personal life."</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez-Vicario, 30, turned pro in 1985 and won 29 singles titles.
Among her victories were French Open championships in 1989, 1994 and
1998, and a U.S. Open title in 1994.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A knee injury will sideline Arizona receiver David Boston, who led
the NFL in yards receiving last season, for the rest of the year.</LD>
<LD>   The Cardinals said Tuesday that orthopedist James Montgomery would
repair a partial tendon tear in Boston's right knee Nov. 20.</LD>
<LD>   Boston, 24, set franchise records for yards receiving (1,598) and
receptions (98) last season. He has a team-high 32 catches for 512
yards and one touchdown this year.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The New York Giants agreed to contract terms with receiver Herman
Moore.</TE>
<TE>   Moore, 33, the Detroit Lions' all-time leading receiver, would be
paid $308,824 to finish the season, based on a $750,000 salary.</TE>
<TE>   Moore hasn't played since being put on injured reserve by the
Lions early last season because of a hip injury.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants are desperate for receivers after losing Ike Hilliard
(shoulder) and Tim Carter (Achilles' tendon) with season-ending
injuries in the last three weeks. Ron Dixon, Hilliard's replacement,
sprained a knee Sunday and is expected to sit out two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Jacquez Green was waived by the Washington Redskins.</TE>
<TE>   The Redskins promoted receiver Justin Skaggs from the practice
squad.</TE>
<TE>   Green, one of five former Florida players on ex-Gator coach Steve
Spurrier's roster, signed a three-year, $4.3-million contract in
March as a free agent from Tampa Bay. But he had only five catches
for 94 yards through 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   He was one of several players who openly questioned Spurrier's
constant shuffling of receivers earlier this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis Colt owner Jim Irsay acknowledged that he had become
dependent on prescription painkillers, and said he has overcome the
problem since undergoing treatment this year.</TE>
<TE>   Irsay, 43, issued a statement in response to a report by
Indianapolis television station WTHR, which said Irsay has a history
of substance abuse that includes at least three overdoses of
prescription drugs and treatment at clinics in Indiana and Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "I have successfully dealt with my dependence and my chronic pain
issues," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The station reported that Irsay was being investigated by federal
and local authorities for prescription drug fraud, but Colt general
counsel Dan Luther said the team didn't know of any investigation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle signed two linebackers: five-year NFL veteran Terry
Killens and training camp player Keith Miller. The Seahawks made room
on the roster by putting guard Steve Hutchinson and linebacker Chad
Brown on injured reserve.... Oakland defensive end Tony Bryant will
sit out at least four weeks because of a neck injury.... Punt
returner Tamarick Vanover was released by the San Diego Chargers. He
was averaging only 5.4 yards per punt return.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Colorado Avalanche continued to struggle on special teams,
survived a late goal and fought off a flurry of shots in the final
six minutes, but somehow found a way to finally end its worst home
start.</LD>
<LD>   Milan Hejduk scored two goals, and Peter Forsberg had a goal and
an assist as Colorado ended its home winless streak at eight games
with a 5-4 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets on Tuesday night at
Denver.</LD>
<LD>   "Certainly it was not a fun week for anyone, starting with our
fans, for us, the management, the players," Coach Bob Hartley said.</LD>
<TE>   "We were not happy with where we were at and we are still not
happy with where we are at, but tonight it's two points."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado, the last NHL team to win at home, improved to 1-4-3-1 at
home and salvaged one win in its five-game home stand (1-3-0-1).</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver 6, St. Louis 3 -- Todd Bertuzzi, Todd Warriner, Brendan
Morrison and Artem Chubarov each had a goal and an assist as the
Canucks ended a six-game winless streak at Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton 3, Minnesota 2 -- Mike Comrie scored twice at St. Paul,
Minn., for the Oilers, who are unbeaten (9-0-2-0) against the Wild.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 4, Montreal 2 -- Sergei Zubov, Manny Malhotra and Jason
Arnott each scored first-period goals for the Stars at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Pierre Turgeon got the 1,200th point of his career with an assist
on Arnott's goal.</TE>
<TE>   Arnott's goal gave the Stars a 3-0 lead just 10:07 in.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 4, Nashville 1 -- Brendan Shanahan scored twice to break a
nine-game goal drought and added an assist at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Erat scored for Nashville, which ended a franchise-high
seven-game trip 2-2-1-2.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 5, New York Islanders 3 -- Shaun Van Allen's goal early in
the third period proved to be the game-winner at Uniondale, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa is 19-1-6 in the last 26 meetings with the Islanders.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 4, Buffalo 3 -- Joe Thornton scored two goals at Buffalo,
N.Y., as the Bruins extended the Sabres' winless streak to nine.</TE>
<TE>   The Sabres are 0-7-2 during the streak, three short of the team
record of 12 set in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   They are only one point ahead of Atlanta for the worst record in
the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 3, Phoenix 2 -- Ron Francis had a goal and an assist, and
Kevin Weekes stopped 27 shots for the Hurricanes at Raleigh, N.C.</TE>

<TE>   A player with the approximate body weight of popcorn just got
nailed for steroids.</TE>
<TE>   Soumaila Samake?</TE>
<TE>   Steroids?</TE>
<TE>   What's next, the Pillsbury Doughboy busted for diet pills?</TE>
<TE>   "Guy was just trying to get stronger because he knew I was going
to bust his butt every day in practice," said Shaquille O'Neal with a
shrug.</TE>
<TE>   Say it again.</TE>
<TE>   Enunciate it longer than one of Bryant's disapproving glares.</TE>
<TE>   It's ... too ... early ... to ... worry.</TE>
<TE>   We think.</TE>
<TE>   "This is only a terrible, bad dream," O'Neal reassured Tuesday
before the Lakers' 95-83 loss. "Real life will be back soon."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, nothing about the Lakers' 2-6 start will mean anything
once he returns.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant can stop shooting. Tracy Murray can start shooting.</TE>
<TE>   George can chill, Horry can rest, Fisher can deal, and Jerry
Stackhouse tries that again, he's getting knocked into the Potomac.</TE>
<TE>   Even when O'Neal plays, a Laker autumn means little to a team that
lives for spring.</TE>
<TE>   Without O'Neal, it means even less.</TE>
<TE>   Judging from the bored looks Tuesday from fans too numb to even
boo, it means nothing.</TE>
<TE>   If we have learned nothing else in three seasons, we have learned
this.</TE>
<TE>   "The day is not over," O'Neal said. "I will close the deal."</TE>
<TE>   We don't doubt him.</TE>
<TE>   It's his toe we don't trust.</TE>
<TE>   He postponed his first anticipated return date from toe surgery
Tuesday, and the disappointment felt by his teammates was palpable.</TE>
<TE>   When he does finally return -- what, in 10 days, two weeks, a
month? -- how long will it take for him to work into playing shape?</TE>
<TE>   What is he going to do with the added weight?</TE>
<TE>   Are we looking at March before he can truly march again?</TE>
<TE>   That's OK. Keep reminding yourself.</TE>
<TE>   It's too early to worry.</TE>
<TE>   Um, er, right?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think this has been wearing us down," said Samaki Walker
of the Lakers' dreadful start. "I think it's only making us tougher."</TE>
<TE>   The overtime loss in Boston and 17-point comeback in Washington --
all without O'Neal -- can somehow be spun positively.</TE>
<TE>   That their four-game series against the Sacramento Kings doesn't
begin until Christmas is a lucky break.</TE>
<TE>   And everyone remembers that the Lakers won their last two
championships without home-court advantage, so does it really matter
where they finish?</TE>
<TE>   "Better this happen early in the day than late in the day," O'Neal
said.</TE>
<TE>   But even this early, there are troubling things, blaring like an
annoying alarm clock.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's mental state is one of them.</TE>
<TE>   Placed in the awkward position of leading an offense based around
a player who is not there, he has been criticized for shooting too
much, ripped for not being involved enough, caught in a spot where he
cannot win.</TE>
<TE>   After proving his unselfishness for the last three springs, he
should have earned everyone's trust by now. But apparently, he has
not. And understandably, it bothers him.</TE>
<TE>   So angered by recent events, he said little to his teammates for
three days before Tuesday's game.</TE>
<TE>   "I want them to feel the responsibility to put the ball in the
hole," Bryant said. "Their roles have changed now."</TE>
<TE>   Then there is George who, after being properly criticized by
Bryant for failing to guard Stackhouse on Friday, has decided it's no
fun being accountable.</TE>
<TE>   So, unlike his higher-profile teammates who have mostly faced the
music during the last three years, George has decided to no longer
speak to the media.</TE>
<TE>   Guess $18.45 million doesn't buy what it used to.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson joked Tuesday that George's ankle injuries were aggravated
by newspaper stories.</TE>
<TE>   It's no joke that the various other missteps suffered by this
team's important role players make one wonder whether they are tired,
or aging, or finally bending under the weight of three years of
pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, when O'Neal comes back, everything changes, and the
Lakers become the Lakers again.</TE>
<TE>   It's definitely, without a doubt, much too early to worry.</TE>
<TE>   Or is it?</TE>

<HD>This Wedding Invitation Won't Be Easily Bagged</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Well, when I heard the Dodgers had paid Chad Kreuter $300,000 to get
lost I can't tell you what a relief that was. You have no idea how
hard it is to whittle a guest list for a wedding.</LD>
<LD>   I've already crossed off the Grocery Store Bagger's name two or
three times, but for some reason it always seems to reappear.</LD>
<LD>   I hope the folks who are on the bubble appreciate some of the
tough choices that are going to have to be made: Do you invite Bum
Garner? Do you allow him to bring a date? Could he find a date? Would
you want the kind of date he might find to show up at your party? Or
do you just invite him to the wedding for old time's sake but give
him the wrong location for the reception?</LD>
<TE>   I'll provide maps for most people because I've always wanted to
tell the Mighty Ducks where to go. And besides, it wouldn't be fair
to have Eric Karros strike out on his own again.</TE>
<TE>   But when it comes to the reception, whom do you sit next to Mike
Garrett? Is there a limit on the number of dates Jerry Buss can bring
along? No kids are allowed, but how do you make sure David Eckstein
gets in without a hassle.?</TE>
<TE>   Think about it, do you even invite the Angels knowing they will
all be wearing bigger rings than the bride? If you do, you probably
have to invite some of the Dodgers so the bride doesn't feel so
badly?</TE>
<TE>   If nearly half of all brides and grooms in a weddingchannel.com
survey say finding a way to request money as a wedding gift is the
most challenging etiquette issue they face, how do you tell them to
word that invitation to Donald Sterling?</TE>
<TE>   I spent last weekend at the drag races in Pomona so I could get
the feel of what it's going to be like hanging around the Bagger's
relatives, but now I see where the Emily Post Institute says "wedding
gifts should be delivered to the bride's home or the home of her
parents before the wedding," and I don't want any of those people
knowing where we live.</TE>
<TE>   There are just a lot of things to consider before we get a final
count, and so the more quickly someone like Brian Jordan, for
example, comes to a decision about staying or leaving, it's going to
help. No need, though, for the Sparks to worry their pretty little
heads; it's already set up so there's no competition when it comes
time for Jeanie Buss to catch the bouquet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AT THE very last moment, Coach Phil Jackson changed his selection
from the Lakers starting the season 0-7 to 2-5, and so they did. When
I brought it up Tuesday night, for the record, it was Jackson who
mentioned the Pick Six.</TE>
<TE>   Well, you know how that goes, there are accusations now that three
former Drexel fraternity brothers were in cahoots, turning themselves
into the FBI after allegedly changing their selections in the
Breeders' Cup to win $3 million in the Pick Six. And so I asked
Jackson if he has ever spent any time at Drexel, and he said a former
teammate of his had gone to Drexel at one time, and so no, I'm not
surprised Jackson knew exactly how the Lakers would open the season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ECKSTEIN AND the Red Sox's Nomar Garciaparra tied for 11th in
American League most-valuable-player voting, which is pretty
interesting shortstop company.</TE>
<TE>   What's more outlandish, however: One writer voting Eckstein the
fifth-best player in the American League, or two National League
writers not including the Dodgers' Shawn Green among the 10 names
they each submitted on their ballots?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE REASONS continue to pile up -- more than 30 million of them
now -- why San Diego might not fight to keep the Chargers when the
Spanos Goofs start seriously flirting with L.A.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Business Journal reported San Diego has already
spent in excess of $30 million to buy back unused Charger tickets the
last few years, including the 7,958 to the team's earlier home game
against New England at a cost of $54.85 per ticket.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN THE Steelers played the Falcons on Sunday, the game drew a
43.8 TV rating in Pittsburgh and a 70 share. In places like New York
and L.A., there is something to do besides spend the day in front of
the TV. The Giants' game drew a 10.7 rating and 23 share in New York,
while the Jets pulled a 12.9 and 17 share. In L.A. the 49ers-Chiefs
drew a 19 rating at its peak, and 25 share. You can only imagine how
much higher that it would've been had the 2,000 or 3,000 people, who
went to the women's tennis tournament, stayed home to watch football.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   49ER RECEIVER Terrell Owens' jersey is the No. 8 seller around the
league according to NFL totals; former San Francisco receiver Jerry
Rice, the game's all-time touchdown scoring leader who plays for the
Raiders, wears the No. 18 best-selling jersey. Chicago linebacker
Brian Urlacher's jersey remains the No. 1 seller. I don't believe
they're selling Marc Bulger jerseys yet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HOW'S THIS for a heavyweight foursome together in courtside seats
for the Laker game against Atlanta: Olympic decathlete Rafer Johnson,
mega-Hollywood producer David Wolper and actors Richard Crenna and
Mike Connors. You could tell right away they were pros, leaving Bill
Plaschke to write his column and not one of them interrupting to ask
for his autograph.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Luis Hernandez:</TE>
<TE>   "Fellow Times' employee Ross Newhan was inducted into the Baseball
Hall of Fame, while Shav Glick has a media center named for him. If
it's any consolation, I always read your column and watch ('Around
the Horn') when you're on the tub."</TE>
<TE>   I'm sure you meant to type "tube," but you were probably thinking
about something going down the drain at the time.</TE>

<HD>Sierra Bustling After First Snowfall</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When darkness gave way to sunshine Monday morning, long-barren slopes
wore a glistening white blanket up to four feet thick in places,
courtesy of a blizzard that worked its magic for four long, cold days
through the Sierra Nevada mountains.</LD>
<LD>   Since, the mad scramble that follows every first storm has been
underway, as ski-area operators began preparing for the onslaught of
skiers and snowboarders.</LD>
<LD>   At Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, which opened on a limited basis as
the snow began to fall last Thursday, two to four feet of fresh
powder has allowed for more lift service this week.</LD>
<TE>   Broadway Express, Stump Alley Express, Face Lift Express,
Thunderbound Express and Discovery Chair all were operating Tuesday,
and today the Panorama gondola will start.</TE>
<TE>   "I just got off the phone with [ski] patrol and they told me no
trails will be roped off or closed, so everything at the top is fair
game," Mammoth spokeswoman Kellie Hines said, cautioning that there
might be bare spots in places.</TE>
<TE>   In the Lake Tahoe area, where only Boreal has opened and with
limited terrain, crews have been assessing conditions and determining
when to start the lifts.</TE>
<TE>   The shakedown: Alpine Meadows will open Thursday; Kirkwood and
Squaw Valley USA will open Saturday; Heavenly will open Nov. 22;
Northstar-at-Tahoe will open Nov. 23, and Sierra-at-Tahoe will open
Nov. 29.</TE>
<TE>   "We received 36 to 48 inches on the upper mountain and will open
eight lifts," said Katja Dahl, spokeswoman for Squaw Valley. "It's
unusual for one storm to give us enough snow to open [so much of] the
mountain but this was the perfect mix of wet snow and the colder, dry
snow on top of that to create a perfect base."</TE>
<TE>   All the Tahoe-area resorts will be opening on a limited basis and
offering reduced lift-ticket prices. But if another expected storm
materializes this weekend, it should allow for expanded operations
well in advance of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Southern California, a heat wave has left the
long-barren slopes looking more barren than ever.</TE>

<LD>Italian soccer, viewed in recent years as declining in the face of
challenges from Spain's La Liga and England's Premier League, has
proven otherwise in the latest round of European Champions League
play.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, two more Serie A clubs, Inter Milan and AS Roma,
qualified for the second round of the tournament, meaning that for
the first time, four Italian teams will be among the final 16.</LD>
<LD>   Inter Milan used two goals in two minutes by Argentine striker
Hernan Crespo to defeat Ajax Amsterdam, 2-1, in front of 50,272 in
the Netherlands. At the Olympic Stadium in Rome, meanwhile, AS Roma
held on to tie AEK Athens, 1-1, and secure its place.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier, AC Milan and Juventus had clinched their berths in the
second round.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's most dramatic game, however, was played in Basel,
Switzerland, where FC Basel jumped out to a 3-0 lead over Liverpool
after 30 minutes on goals by the Argentine duo of Julio Hernan Rossi
and Christian Gimenez and another by Timothee Atouba.</TE>
<TE>   The English team fought back to tie the game, with Danny Murphy,
Vladimir Smicer and Michael Owen scoring in the second half, but
Liverpool could not get the winner it needed and was eliminated from
the Champions League as FC Basel became the first Swiss team to reach
the final 16.</TE>
<TE>   In other games, it was Auxerre 1, Borussia Dortmund 0; Arsenal 0,
PSV Eindhoven 0; Valencia 3, Spartak Moscow 0; Genk 1, Real Madrid 1;
and Rosenborg Trondheim 1, Olympique Lyon 1.</TE>
<TE>   The final three spots in the second round will be determined by
today's games.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil Adds Four</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's interim coach, Mario Zagallo, Tuesday added four
Brazilian-based players to his roster for the world champions' game
Nov. 20 against South Korea in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   Zagallo called up goalkeeper Julio Cesar and left back Athirson,
both from Flamengo, along with defender Anderson Polga from Gremio
and midfielder Kleberson from Atletico Paranaense.</TE>
<TE>   Zagallo earlier had named 19 European-based players for the game,
but Serginho and Luizao have since dropped out and Ronaldinho and
Juan are doubtful because of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Irish Squabble</TE>
<TE>   An independent inquiry into the World Cup row between Ireland's
former coach, Mick McCarthy, and his top player, midfielder Roy
Keane, that led to Keane's being banished from the tournament,
condemned the Irish soccer federation (FAI) for mishandling the
matter.</TE>
<TE>   The report stated that there was no culture of discipline within
the FAI and said basic management techniques were totally absent.</TE>
<TE>   In accepting the inquiry's findings, Brendan Menton, the FAI's
general secretary, resigned.</TE>
<TE>   Dossena Quits</TE>
<TE>   Albania's coach, former Italian national team player Giuseppe
Dossena, resigned, with the Albanian soccer federation saying he had
done so after only four months in charge because widespread fan and
media criticism had left him in "a bad spiritual mood."</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>With Trojans Ahead, No Detail Is Unnoticed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was opposite day at UCLA. Offensive players wore blue jerseys and
defensive players wore white during practice, and it was more than
just a whim.</LD>
<LD>   "I want the quarterbacks looking at white jerseys," Coach Bob
Toledo said.</LD>
<LD>   USC, of course, wears white on the road, so the Bruins will stick
with these colors for the next two weeks. Toledo won't go as far as
outfitting the defense in red helmets.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't afford that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The switch was one of a handful of subtle reminders that rival USC
is the next Bruin opponent. Assistant Todd Littlejohn sang the Trojan
fight song after a Bruin defensive back was beat on a long pass by a
scout team receiver.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Ryan Smith will not play the rest of the season and is
seeking permission from UCLA physician Gerald Finerman to have a
specialist from outside UCLA perform surgery on his ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, a junior, has not played in the last two games because of
recurring pain. Finerman performed surgery on the ankle in February,
but the pain has persisted. Dr. Ron Smith, a Long Beach-based foot
specialist, evaluated Smith last week and recommended an orthopedic
surgeon.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As defensive tackle Rodney Leisle took the practice field, a
teammate shouted, "The big dog is back in the house."</TE>
<TE>   Leisle, a preseason All-American, has missed the last five games
because of a foot injury that required surgery. On Tuesday, he suited
up for the first time, but will not participate in contact drills
until next week.</TE>
<TE>   He is guarded about the prospect of playing against USC because he
believes he played too long with the injury in nonconference games.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got nearly two weeks to test it," he said. "If it's too
sore, it's not worth the risk. But I'm going to give it my best
shot."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Tab Perry (concussion) and cornerback Matt Ware (rib,
hamstring) did not practice.... Several players wore numbers that
were not their own during practice, and that was a whim. Cornerback
Ricky Manning went from No. 9 to No. 99, and receiver Craig Bragg and
tight end Blane Kezirian traded numbers.</TE>

<KH>USC REPORT</KH>
<HD>Season Is Over for Vandermade</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lenny Vandermade, USC's starting left guard, will miss the rest of
the season because of a torn tendon in his right biceps, it was
announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Vandermade, a redshirt junior who has started 29 of 33 games, was
injured on Saturday during the eighth-ranked Trojans' 49-17 victory
over Stanford. He will undergo surgery Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "I just want to get this done and get it better and put it behind
me," said Vandermade, who will be replaced by junior Eric Torres for
Saturday's game against Arizona State.</LD>
<TE>   Vandermade was injured on a second-half play against Stanford when
Trojan running back Justin Fargas inadvertently hit Vandermade's arm
with his helmet. Vandermade finished the series but was replaced by
Torres.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Vandermade took part in limited drills and said he
hoped the injury was only a deep bruise. An MRI exam Tuesday revealed
the tear.</TE>
<TE>   "The pain wasn't unbearable, I felt I could play with it,"
Vandermade said. "It was more of a strength deal. It didn't hurt but
it was a little bit weak. They don't want me to overcompensate for it
and injure something else.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed. I feel like I let some people down."</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll said he expects Vandermade to be ready for
spring practice.</TE>
<TE>   Torres, who started every game at right tackle last year, will
start at his fourth position this season.</TE>
<TE>   Vandermade is the fourth starter to suffer a season-ending injury.
Cornerback Kevin Arbet broke a bone in his foot during training camp.
Cornerback Ronald Nunn tore a knee ligament against Kansas State.
Defensive tackle Shaun Cody tore a knee ligament against California.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman offensive lineman Fred Matua was slated to start the
opener at right guard in place of senior Zach Wilson, but Matua
injured his right knee and had arthroscopic surgery in October. He
has been working with the scout team the last two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wide receiver Mike Williams, who has a left ankle sprain,
participated in about half of practice before retiring to the
trainer's table. Williams said he expects to do more today....
Freshman tackle Winston Justice did extra work after practice against
defensive end Kenechi Udeze to prepare for Arizona State's Terrell
Suggs, who leads the nation with 19.5 sacks.... Cornerback William
Buchanon remained sidelined because of a neck strain, but said he
hoped to play Saturday.... Freshman cornerback Justin Wyatt will be
used in the nickel package, Carroll said.</TE>

<HD>Sorry, but the Economy Is No Longer in Service</HD>
<DH>Efficiency has crossed wires with getting simple things
done.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Who are you gonna believe," Groucho Marx quipped, "me or your own
eyes?" This old line from the movie "Duck Soup" always comes to mind
when I read about productivity in the American workplace. The way the
Marx brothers of our economy tell it, everything good about the
nation can be measured in the perpetual, incremental and essential
gains in worker efficiency -- that is, our ability to produce more in
less time by fewer of us.</LD>
<LD>   Didn't Alan Greenspan just say it was the bright spot in all the
gloom?</LD>
<LD>   My own eyes see the matter differently, quite differently in fact.
A good share of what's bad and getting worse about the age in which
we live can be traced to the whip-cracking, heartless -- and now
laughably counterproductive -- demand that everyone be more
productive, no matter what the cost. At least eight out of 10 people
I know feel exactly the same way, and the other two aren't the kind
who will indulge in such topics.</LD>
<TE>   You have to wonder, don't economists spend at least some time in
the real world too?</TE>
<TE>   For instance, my new telephone directory arrived. I set out to
find a newly published memoir that had been recommended to me. Odd,
but four of five of the nearest bookstores are not listed in the
Yellow Pages.</TE>
<TE>   This is efficiency at work. Because the missing bookstores are
owned by chains, and because chains are the essence of efficiency,
bean counters at headquarters have consolidated contracts for
telephone services. Naturally, that means that my neighborhood
bookstore managers must forward matters to the executive offices in
New York, where Southern California is regarded as an indecipherable
mess -- never mind that it's the No. 1 book-buying market in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than taking the time (time being the enemy of efficiency)
to fill out and return the form that would have the Long Beach store
listed in the Long Beach directory and the Lakewood store listed in
Lakewood, the bookstore headquarters do what? Apparently nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Result: 80% of my local stores do not get listed in the Yellow
Pages, but who cares anyway because they're in suburban Southern
California, and you know what that means.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been on my supervisor for years about this," the manager of
a store down the street told me. "We've found ourselves not even
listed in directory assistance either. People get so mad because they
know we're here and they can't call."</TE>
<TE>   My telephone company, also headquartered in New York, is no help
in the matter. This merged behemoth of several companies has a motto
about "making progress every day," but I note that it cleverly does
not say in which direction. A spokesman explained that without a
proper form to scan into a computer, there is no way of determining
whether a bookseller should be listed in the category "books." So,
for the sake of efficiency, it's presumed that the store prefers not
to appear in the Yellow Pages.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lived here 44 years, and I've noticed the problem for some
time now. But it's much worse lately," Lakewood Mayor Larry Van
Nostran told me. The two bookstores in his city have gone unlisted,
down from only one missing in last year's telephone books. "It's
grossly unfair to entrepreneurs here who don't get listed while
competitors outside the area do."</TE>
<TE>   Some friends say I'm wasting my time with the old-fashioned phone
book anyway. Heave it, they say, and embrace the efficiency of the
future.</TE>
<TE>   OK, I'll go online. Using what is supposed to be the world's
largest Internet Yellow Pages, I click through three tedious Web
pages and get an 800 number for the bookstore chain. Calling, I talk
my way past one voice recognition machine to reach another. Prompted
to give the intersection of the desired bookstore, the machine
mistakes Westminster Avenue as Packet Avenue and repeatedly
misunderstands Pacific Coast Highway. I respond to a total of 22
machine-generated questions. Now I have my number.</TE>
<TE>   A clerk at the store, untrained and overworked but no doubt
efficiently economical, narrows my search. The store computer shows
one copy of Jim Harrison's new memoir on hand. But the clerk cannot
find it on the shelves.</TE>
<TE>   To heck with this. I get in the car. The book is stacked six high
on the "new releases" table at the front entrance. Efficiency? You
figure it out, Groucho.</TE>

<HD>Indian Casinos Open Way for Black Reparations</HD>
<DH>However you cut it, gambling monopolies are compensation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Dickey</AU>
<BD>Fred Dickey is a journalist who writes on social and
governmental issues that affect California, including tribal gaming.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There has been so much dust kicked up by arguments over reparations
in recent months that most people can't see that it's already an
accomplished fact. Not for African Americans, who have been the ones
most insistent -- and most rebuffed -- in seeking redress of
historical wrongs, but for American Indians.</LD>
<LD>   Don't start surfing the Net looking for recent laws that authorize
checks for Indian reparations. These payments came through the back
door, accompanied by slot machines, blackjack tables and cheap
buffets.</LD>
<LD>   In March 2000, California voters passed Proposition 1-A, which
gave the state's registered Indian tribes the right to a virtually
unrestricted and thinly regulated monopoly on casino gambling
(similar provisions are in place in many other states).</LD>
<TE>   The tribes and their supporters use historical injustice as the
centerpiece of their pleas for public approval of their gambling
privileges. They cite a litany of grievances, and most have merit.
But the point is that the Indians themselves consider their gambling
monopoly to be their due, though they don't use the R word.</TE>
<TE>   The reparation reward to tribes is grand indeed. To own a casino
is to be backed up to the loading dock of the federal mint. The 50
casinos operating in California -- and more are on the way --
overflow the pockets of the 49 tribes that operate them. The gambling
haul for the tribes in California this year alone should be about $5
billion -- all of it free of federal and state taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Tribal advocates also maintain that their right to have casinos is
justified by their status as "sovereign nations," and therefore they
should be able to operate free of regulations by "other" governments,
i.e., the state of California and the United States. They base that
idea on the original 19th century federal description of the tribes
as "domestic, dependent, sovereign nations."</TE>
<TE>   However, the meaning of that definition is that the tribes and
their reservations are subject to the whim of Congress. So it's fair
to say that if your status is at the mercy of someone else's say-so,
you might be domestic and you might be dependent, but you're
definitely not sovereign.</TE>
<TE>   Sovereignty in its governmental sense is New Zealand or Norway,
not a small reservation reliant on local government for public
services.</TE>
<TE>   Pretending that tiny Indian tribes with a handful of members are
sovereign nations is a logic-stretching legal artifice to justify
letting those tribes operate casinos and reap other lucrative
tax-free privileges.</TE>
<TE>   Call it by its real name -- reparations. The reservation system
was instituted to give tribes a haven from exploitation by
non-Indians. No one then envisioned creating enclaves where visiting
gamblers would be left naked of protection from civil law.</TE>
<TE>   An additional benefit of the casino monopoly is the generation of
mounds of cash to invest in "friendly" legislators such as Sen. Jim
Battin (R-La Quinta), who, as the tribes grew in wealth, suddenly had
his eyes opened to the justice of the tribes' legislative agenda.
Campaign contributions of $700,000 since 1998 may have also helped
him see the light.</TE>
<TE>   Battin is not alone. Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee said the
tribes couldn't get the time of day in state government a few years
ago. Now they own the place.</TE>
<TE>   Is this an argument against what Proposition 1-A gave the tribes?
No, they won it fair and square by convincing voters of the justness
of their cause. But the unprecedented generosity with which the
public responded certainly shouts what it was -- reparations.</TE>
<TE>   The history of the United States is of a nation that was a
blessing to many but a curse to others. Those who bear scars of
injustice form a long line, with Native Americans at the front. But
no scar is uglier or deeper than the one that runs from the memory to
the soul of those who carry the devil's DNA of bondage and Jim Crow.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for African American reparations have a stronger claim
now that opponents have to explain the multibillion-dollar reparation
given to 36,500 tribal members in California alone.</TE>
<TE>   To cast the issue in gambling terms, the chance of African
Americans achieving reparations faces very long political odds. But
they are at least entitled to an answer to this question: If you open
the door for Native Americans, why do you slam it on us?</TE>

<HD>The Sin of Media Ignorance</HD>
<DH>The misinformation about the bishops' conference is
intolerable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew M. Greeley</AU>
<BD>Andrew M. Greeley, a priest and sociologist in
Chicago, is the author, most recently, of "Irish Stew!" (Tor Books,
2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Catholic bishops and the Vatican are getting a bad rap on
the "rewriting" of the protocol to protect children from predatory
priests that the bishops adopted in Dallas in June.</LD>
<LD>   I started decrying child abuse by priests in 1985 and lost most of
my friends in the priesthood for, in effect, breaking the code of
silence. So the Catholic clergy may deserve the bad rap because of
its own ineptitude. Yet the bias in the news stories establishes in
my mind the fact that in this round, some journalists and some
television writers have turned viciously anti-Catholic.</LD>
<LD>   Despite what you may have heard or read, the following is not
happening at the meeting of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops
in Washington this week:</LD>
<TE>   * The lay review boards in every diocese are not being downgraded.
They've always been advisory -- though no bishop in his right mind
rejects their "advice." Even if more than a few bishops are not in
their right minds, they will be clobbered by all the others if they
mess this up.</TE>
<TE>   * The bishops are not saying they do not have to report cases to
the civil authorities. Quite the contrary, the suggested revisions
underline this obligation.</TE>
<TE>   * The bishops have not and will not give up the power to prevent
an abusing priest permanently from doing ministerial work, no matter
what may happen in the appellate process.</TE>
<TE>   * There is no major rewriting of the document drawn up by the
bishops this past June in Dallas, save in matters concerning due
process for accused priests. Here, bizarrely enough, the Vatican is
playing the role of the American Civil Liberties Union: It is
protecting the right of one to be presumed innocent until proved
guilty and thrown out of the priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   * It is not true that offenders from the past will be excused
because of a statute of limitations. A bishop can still prevent such
a man from doing ministerial work. Moreover, if he wants to throw the
man out of the priesthood, he can apply to Rome for permission to
suspend the statute. Such permission usually is granted.</TE>
<TE>   There is a complete lack of clarity in many news stories about the
difference between ejecting a man from the priesthood, which requires
due process, and banning him from priestly ministry, which does not.</TE>
<TE>   How did all this confusion arise?</TE>
<TE>   First of all, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, who headed the
Vatican commission that reviewed the Dallas documents, seems to have
thought that they were adequate enough to be tested for two years.
Unfortunately, this recommendation was overruled by others who had no
sense of how angry American Catholics were.</TE>
<TE>   Then the American bishops made the terrible mistake of keeping the
Rome document secret for four days while the media distorted it
beyond recognition.</TE>
<TE>   The distortion was abetted by a few of the supposed victims'
leaders who, reveling in their power and 15 minutes of fame, don't
want any due process for the accused. They probably would not be
satisfied if the Vatican had mandated castration for every priest in
the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the reporting on the bishops' meeting is so filled with
misinformation that it has to be either deliberately anti-Catholic or
intolerably ignorant.</TE>
<TE>   Add to that such emotionally charged television as Sunday's
episode of the ABC drama "The Practice," in which the main character
announces that he is so angry about the abuse scandal that he is
leaving the church.</TE>
<TE>   Here is the problem: The Vatican doesn't know what is going on in
the U.S. The American bishops do, but they can't or won't explain it
properly. So that leaves others to explain, and their motives are not
to explain but to defame.</TE>

<HD>Ashcroft's Law West -- and East -- of the Pecos</HD>
<DH>He is arbitrarily deciding who can be tried where.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Turley</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Turley is a law professor at George Washington
University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If there is one legal principle that seems to guide Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft, it is this: Possession is nine-tenths of the law.</LD>
<LD>   In holding citizens and noncitizens, Ashcroft has claimed
unilateral authority to dictate how and where they will be tried and,
most important, executed.</LD>
<LD>   In the last few weeks, he has taken this control to a new level,
defying states and judges who do not conform to his demands for
speedy justice.</LD>
<TE>   For some officials in Maryland, Ashcroft virtually took on the
role of a body snatcher in the aftermath of the arrest of the
Washington sniper suspects. Though many observers thought that
Maryland would have the clear claim for the first prosecutions as the
state with the first and most murders in the case, the state's
historical caution in using the death penalty did not sit well with
Ashcroft.</TE>
<TE>   So the Justice Department simply took possession of both suspects.
What followed was a prosecutorial version of EBay. For a week, all
the prosecutors were dialing in their bids to Ashcroft, publicly
shilling for their ability to deliver the death penalty in a jiffy.
Virginia had the advantage, promising not only to ice both defendants
but also to execute their Chevy Caprice to seal the deal. Ashcroft
handed the two over to Virginia like kitchen appliances on layaway
plan.</TE>
<TE>   While giving up such prize defendants, however, Ashcroft recently
made clear that no deal is final -- until execution. Consider the
fate of accused Sept. 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui in a Virginia
federal court. Although Ashcroft had previously moved Moussaoui from
Minnesota to this ultraconservative court, the judge started behaving
strangely: She was actually considering defense motions. In the
Ashcroft Justice Department, such due process is viewed as coddling.
Ashcroft is now reported to be thinking of taking back Moussaoui for
a fast military tribunal.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema is not the only judge in
Virginia to earn Ashcroft's ire. U.S. District Judge Robert G. Doumar
refused to go along with Ashcroft's unilateral actions in the case of
Yaser Esam Hamdi, a U.S. citizen accused of having terrorist
connections. Doumar demanded proof other than Ashcroft's assertion
that he has the power to declare any person an "enemy combatant" and
thus entitled to no constitutional rights. Ashcroft refused. He
reportedly now is putting Hamdi on a list for a tribunal as well.</TE>
<TE>   A military tribunal is designed for quick convictions, little
appeal and easy executions. It is the convenience store of junk
justice: fast service, cheap products, no substantive value.</TE>
<TE>   It now seems that who is and who is not subject to summary
tribunal justice is up to the shifting inclinations of Ashcroft,
which sometimes appear as arbitrary as his choice of breakfast meat.</TE>
<TE>   For example, John Walker Lindh was captured fighting in
Afghanistan after being trained by Al Qaeda. Ashcroft let him have a
real trial in a real court. Hamdi, also arrested in Afghanistan, has
been denied access to counsel or the courts.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Jose Padilla, a Brooklyn, N.Y., native arrested in
May at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and accused of plotting
to set off a "dirty bomb." Ashcroft has stripped him of all rights
and denied him access to courts or counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Most attorneys general would resist removing cases from the
Justice Department and declaring the military to have a superior
judiciary. But Ashcroft has become a walking contradiction, more
general than attorney. Whereas his predecessors viewed the justice
system as the very thing that defines us as a nation of laws,
Ashcroft views justice as merely one means to an end.</TE>
<TE>   As he prepares his list for summary judgment and execution, the
American justice system will be the first to be dispatched.</TE>

<LD>The Pentagon's shift from bombing Afghanistan to rebuilding it
recognizes that although much has been done to provide emergency food
and shelter for Afghans, longer-lasting remedies are needed. Doubling
to more than 300 the number of civil affairs troops dispatched to
bases around the country would allow for the building of more roads,
bridges and schools.</LD>
<LD>   Afghan President Hamid Karzai has pleaded for months for troops
from the 19-nation International Security Assistance Force to be
stationed in cities other than Kabul. Broadening the presence of the
force would protect villagers, let relief agencies work without fear
of attack and counteract warlords who continue to resist the central
government's control.</LD>
<LD>   Karzai also is trying to get nations that promised billions of
dollars to come up with the money to help reconstruct the country.
Expanding the international force, which does not include U.S.
personnel, would provide protection for U.S. Agency for International
Development teams to undertake large-scale projects such as building
power plants and clearing waterways, supplementing the work of
military engineers carrying out smaller projects.</LD>
<TE>   While waiting for expansion of the international force, the U.S.
military civil affairs teams are doing most of the important
rebuilding. Providing more teams to cover a wider area is important.
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Richard B. Myers,
said last week that troops continued to hunt for Al Qaeda and Taliban
members, especially in areas bordering Pakistan, but the next phase
of military operations in Afghanistan would be "primarily the
reconstruction piece." Helping with the rebuilding will show Afghans
that foreign nations are willing to do more than provide emergency
food aid and care for refugees, important though those are. Building
hospitals and universities and training staff to operate the
institutions are key steps in preventing the country from falling
apart again.</TE>
<TE>   An important part of reconstruction will be funneling foreign aid
through the Kabul government and letting it do the hiring of
contractors and nongovernmental organizations to dig wells, repave
streets, repair power plants. A lack of electricity and water played
a part in this week's protests at Kabul University in which at least
one student was killed. Donors attempting to bypass Karzai and his
Cabinet might undercut the government and give more power to the
warlords, whose grip must be broken if the nation is not to descend
into chaos again.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai this month fired more than a dozen top civil and military
chiefs across the country, charging them with corruption and abuse of
power. He will need help in facing down down warlords and making the
firings stick. Showing Afghans that foreign countries will not cut
and run this time as they did after the Soviets were expelled would
increase Karzai's chances of success. Providing more security across
the country would underline the message of commitment.</TE>

<HD>Security Without Snafus</HD>
<DH>Proposed homeland agency cannot afford bureaucratic
failures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Al Qaeda remains a potent threat to the United States. So do the sort
of bureaucratic snafus that could hobble the proposed Homeland
Security Department in its efforts to thwart terrorism -- assuming
Congress finally lets the new Cabinet-level agency get off the
ground, as it probably will within days.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush is right to call efforts to create this department
the "single most important business" before the lame-duck Congress.
But Senate Republicans and Democrats have already squandered too much
energy feuding over whether employees of the department would enjoy
Civil Service protections.</LD>
<LD>   If the homeland security bill passes, however, a host of problems
will remain.</LD>
<TE>   One of the department's main tasks would be to help coordinate
intelligence, but the FBI and CIA are left essentially intact by a
reorganization plan that seeks to combine the powers of various
agencies to fight terrorism. Would the department be able to obtain
information from the intelligence community quickly or would it be
reduced to offering vague and widely ridiculed color-coded warnings
like the ones security czar Tom Ridge has been issuing?</TE>
<TE>   On a similar note, the administration has yet to demonstrate a
coherent plan for coordinating the hodgepodge of agencies it is
proposing to put under the umbrella of homeland security. How, for
instance, does it plan to avoid bureaucratic warfare, making sure
that agencies and departments devote more time to fighting terrorists
than to battling each other for perks and prerogatives?</TE>
<TE>   Another thing: A Council on Foreign Relations study chaired by
former Sens. Gary Hart and Warren Rudman lamented last month that the
government had taken a "reactive" approach to avoiding the next
terrorist attack. The administration has failed to improve
information sharing and the ability of thousands of state and local
"first responders" to counteract terrorist assaults.</TE>
<TE>   Would the Homeland Security Department have the good sense to
coordinate more effectively and provide protective gear and training
for firefighters, paramedics and police officers, those who will be
first on the scene the next time Al Qaeda or some similar enemy
strikes?</TE>
<TE>   To avoid a fiasco, the president should put the fledgling agency
in the hands of former Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.), Sen. Richard G.
Lugar (R-Ind.) or someone similarly familiar with both international
and domestic issues.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government is about to experience its biggest upheaval
since the late 1940s, when Harry Truman reorganized the defense
establishment. The Homeland Security Department needs a leader with
zero tolerance for snafus.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Call it economic leadership lag, the self-inflicted malady that keeps
the mighty United States trailing so far behind the European Union
and even small countries such as Mexico in signing free-trade
agreements.</LD>
<LD>   There is no single explanation for why the U.S. is a party to only
three of the more than 190 free-trade agreements worldwide and only
one of about 30 in the Western Hemisphere. Apparently, myopic
isolationism is what happens when powerful interest groups view
international trade agreements -- wrongly -- as zero-sum deals.</LD>
<LD>   In truth, when a nation enters into a free-trade agreement, most
farmers, workers, businesses and families benefit. Foreign markets
expand, spawning domestic development, while consumers gain access to
products at more competitive prices. The agreements also encourage
less economically advanced nations to open their financial systems
and make accounting practices more transparent so that the public can
scrutinize investment choices.</LD>
<TE>   To reverse the isolationist trend, U.S. Trade Representative
Robert B. Zoellick has been moving swiftly in international trade
arenas. The U.S. is seriously engaged in global trade talks with more
than 140 other members of the World Trade Organization. Zoellick's
office is simultaneously wheeling and dealing on regional and
bilateral agreements in the Western Hemisphere and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, for example, Zoellick's office told Congress that the
administration was planning to negotiate a free-trade agreement with
five nations in southern Africa: Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South
Africa and Swaziland. U.S. exports to the region already amount to
$3.1 billion, and total two-way trade is almost $8 billion. An accord
would deepen U.S. economic and political ties to sub-Saharan Africa.</TE>
<TE>   The office is also about to begin free-trade negotiations with
Morocco and with five Central American nations. And it is about to
finish successful talks with Chile and Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   This flurry of activity, which began with the Clinton
administration, got a boost in August when Congress finally decided
to grant the executive branch "trade promotion authority," which
allows administrations to negotiate trade deals that Congress can
accept or reject but not modify.</TE>
<TE>   Congress and protectionist business and labor groups in America
need to get out of free trade's way.</TE>

<HD>Pelosi's Leadership Is What the Democratic Party Needs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Democrats who think Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) is too
liberal to be the House minority leader should look to the successful
strategy of the Republican Party, which has integrated
representatives from the far right to the moderate center in its
leadership and grass-roots structures. Sens. John McCain, Lincoln
Chaffee, Trent Lott and James Inhofe are all in the big Republican
tent. Is Pelosi any further to the left than Majority Whip Tom DeLay
is to the right?</LD>
<LD>   Democrats who urge further moves to the fuzzy center will fail to
inspire party loyalty and voters will be at best confused and at
worst disinterested in what the Democrats stand for. A revitalized
Democratic Party should include popular mainstream issues like tax
cuts for the middle class and effective national defense and also
promote good ideas from the left like universal health care, ending
corporate welfare and an aggressive renewable energy policy.</LD>
<LD>   By including the progressive wing's most appealing issues while
continuing to embrace centrist democratic values, the Democrats can
bring back millions of Green voters and broaden their base of labor,
minorities, professionals and others who feel unrepresented. Pelosi
is exactly what the Democrats need.</LD>

<TE>   Re Pelosi: I support the Democratic Party returning to the left. I
am a Democrat who voted Green at the top of the ticket in the last
election. So did 5% of state voters on Nov. 5. Mainstream candidates
like Gov. Gray Davis do not excite the rank and file. Many Democrats
either vote for third-party candidates or stay home. Those who do
vote for these Democrats often do so out of fear of the alternative
(i.e., the Ralph Nader debacle two years ago).</TE>
<TE>   Democrats need to focus their liberal message on a positive
future. We need to imagine a thriving economy again. We need to
imagine restoring beauty to America. We need to show voters that life
can be better, healthier and safer under a party that prides itself
in knowing the issues, not in being ignorant of them.</TE>

<TE>   I was glad to see Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) step down as
minority leader. But why would Democrats jump out of the frying pan
only to land with firebrand Pelosi? Haven't the Democrats learned
anything from Bill Clinton's victories? Party success comes from
three little words: moderation in everything. Sometimes I wonder if
the D stands for dumb. At this rate, I might even find myself voting
for President Bush.</TE>

two or three countries in the world that will execute a convicted
juvenile, and that Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and other government
officials are searching to find the fastest way to convict and

<LD>As a lifelong Democrat I am getting a little sick of hearing about
former President Clinton's intellect (letter, Nov. 11). What
intellect? He was a great salesman of emotional furniture and snake
oil, with the requisite flair for televangelism. His lying degeneracy
is directly responsible for the Republicans having such an easy time
kicking our rear ends. And we will now pay with courts that will be
in place for years to come. What was so intelligent about that? What

<TE>   "Clinton Was Key to Davis Strategy" (Nov. 8) painted the clearest
picture of duplicity I have seen in recent memory. Bill Clinton and
Gov. Gray Davis forged a strategy to knock off the strongest
Republican contender to deny me and fellow Republicans a viable
representative for our ideals, and he betrayed a friend, Richard
Riordan, who assisted Clinton's own candidacy. What a guy!</TE>
<TE>   The Clintons are the best example of how power corrupts
completely. Winning at all costs means winning without integrity,
without humanity and without purpose. Californians apparently didn't
get the message, but the rest of the country did.</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Whaling</TE>
<TE>   North Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another pundit story. Two reasons for Riordan's failure in the
primary: Riordan and the California Republican Party. Riordan for
running a general election campaign in the primary and the party for
its persistent myopia.</TE>

<LD>Re "L.A. Trauma Care Network Is Revived, but at a Cost," Nov. 7: My
union, the Service Employees International Union, Local 660, took a
lead role in the Measure B campaign along with Republicans,
Democrats, private hospitals and business groups to save our trauma
hospitals. But now we're being criticized for saving "jobs." I've
been a public health nurse for L.A. County and a member of SEIU,
Local 660, for 20 years. My job has been on the line before, or I
should say, the health services I provide.</LD>
<LD>   Think about it. When there's job loss in health care, it means
that patients don't get needed treatment. It means communicable
diseases go unfound and untreated. It puts our entire community at
risk.</LD>
<LD>   So yes, I'm fighting to keep my job and keep our hospitals and
clinics open to ensure access to health care for everyone in L.A.
County. And on Nov. 5, voters said overwhelmingly through Measure B
that they're standing with me to keep our communities healthy.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Joel Kotkin's "new vision for the Valley" (Opinion, Nov. 10) is not
new. It mimics the city of Los Angeles' long-standing general plan
for the Valley with a call for high-density villages near public
transport. It is a vision embraced by urban planners that doesn't
square with what residents appear to want. Kotkin puts down secession
advocates Jeff Brain and Richard Close for lack of a viable vision,
yet their vision is one in which Valley residents make choices for
themselves.</LD>

<TE>   With the defeat of Valley secession, the responsibility rests in
two places: Mayor James Hahn and the City Council must give the
Valley its due share of representation and services. And
reciprocally, proponents of secession must try to work with the mayor
to prove that their grievances can be ameliorated by a more
responsive City Hall and not just a power-drunk fantasy of running
their own city.</TE>

<HD>Catholic Church Defies the Law of the Land</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Much has been written about separation of church and state. But I
fail to follow the latest edicts of the Catholic Church, particularly
well discussed in "In Facing Evil, the Vatican Blinks" by Jason Berry
(Opinion, Nov. 10). If a Protestant minister or one of his assistants
were accused of sexual abuse, he would receive the sheriff in his
church or parsonage and be handcuffed, taken to police headquarters,
fingerprinted and jailed. In 24 to 72 hours he would be arraigned and
(probably) have bail set. He would then stand trial as provided for
in the U.S. and every state. Somewhere I may have missed something,
but I don't understand why the Catholic Church is able to tell the
various agencies it will handle it (it doesn't) and its abusive
priests remain outside our legal system.</LD>
<LD>   Robert S. Mosser</LD>
<LD>   Bakersfield</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Berry calls the Catholic Church's Code of Canon Law "an archaic
standard of justice" simply because it does not always square neatly
with our civil laws. He essentially is faulting the church for its
independence from state governments (the principle of separation of
church and state) and its possessing an ancient system of bylaws for
the purpose of self-regulation -- something an institution as old and
as large as the Catholic Church cannot do without.</TE>

<LD>Bravo for exposing the spending of 1.5 million taxpayer dollars for
the legal defense of public officials in South Gate (Nov. 11). As a
resident of South Gate I am outraged and embarrassed that our City
Council majority has shamelessly spent taxpayer dollars to hire the
top-notch law firm Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp; Hampton to represent
city Treasurer Albert Robles. The same three individuals who make up
the City Council majority also authorized attorneys' fees to fight a
recall effort against them -- stalling the matter in the courts for
almost a year until the state Supreme Court recently denied any
further appeals.</LD>
<LD>   I have news for Mayor Xochilt Ruvalcaba, Vice Mayor Raul Moriel,
Councilwoman Maria Benavides and Robles: You have underestimated the
citizens of South Gate. On Jan. 28, 2003, you will be ousted from
office when the voters of South Gate cast our votes in the special
recall election. Adios, amigos!</LD>

<HD>Chemerinsky's Proposal to Filibuster on Judges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "No to a Far-Right Court: Use Filibusters," by Erwin Chemerinsky
and Catherine Fisk, Commentary, Nov. 11: The Democrats have already
been far more obstructionist with the Bush administration's judicial
nominees than the Republicans ever were with President Clinton's,
despite the fact that President Bush's nominees have been rated "well
qualified" by the American Bar Assn.</LD>
<LD>   Consequently, we now have a huge number of vacancies in the
federal judiciary. Numerous liberal judges were successfully
appointed by Clinton, and Bush should now be accorded the same
privilege in appointing competent conservative judges.</LD>
<LD>   Chemerinsky's proposal that the Democrats filibuster is
irresponsible but typical of his extreme views.</LD>
<TE>   I am one conservative who actually wishes he had been appointed to
the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. He would have fit right in on the
most left-wing (and most overruled) federal appeals court in the
nation, and at least we would no longer have to listen to his voice
or read his columns.</TE>

<HD>Anaheim Profits From Angels' Victories</HD>
<DH>Under ticket-sales deal, the city nets $265,000. The
council will decide where the money goes.</DH>

<LD>The Anaheim Angels' payoff for their magical season came two weeks
ago when the team won its first world championship. Tuesday, the city
of Anaheim cashed in on the team's success -- netting $265,000 from
its ticket-sales deal with the team.</LD>
<LD>   It's the first time since the city renegotiated its stadium lease
with the Angels six years ago that the team has sold enough tickets
for the deal's 2.6 million attendance threshold to kick in.</LD>
<LD>   "It helps pay the bills, and it helps take away some of the bad
years," said Greg Smith, the city's executive director of sports and
entertainment.</LD>
<TE>   Under the deal, the Angels pay the city $2 for every ticket sold
over 2.6 million. The Angels' home attendance, including two
preseason games and nine playoff games, totaled 2,732,860. Had the
Angels been eliminated in the American League Championship Series,
the total attendance would have been about 40,000 shy of 2.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The World Series put us over," Smith said. "I sure think we have
a great chance of hitting 3 million next year."</TE>
<TE>   Smith said the unexpected year-end bonus will go into the city's
general fund.</TE>
<TE>   "I will recommend to the City Council that the money go toward
stadium improvements," he said. "But it's up to the City Council.
They could use it to buy new library books if they want to. Or they
could just save it for a rainy day."</TE>
<TE>   Before Anaheim signed the 33-year lease agreement with Disney, the
city operated the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said the city lost money on the Angels until 1980, when the
Rams football team joined them as tenants of Anaheim Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   When the Angels reached the playoffs in 1982, Smith said, the team
drew 2.8 million and the city netted about $2 million on the Rams and
Angels.</TE>

<HD>Mailer Angers Leading Latinos</HD>

<LD>Politically powerful Latinos and other elected officials heightened
pressure Tuesday on an Alhambra attorney to stop his attack campaign
against Los Angeles City Council candidate Antonio Villaraigosa, as
evidence surfaced of the attorney's professional troubles.</LD>
<LD>   According to the California Bar Journal, Ricardo A. Torres II, a
personal injury lawyer, was suspended in January for 30 days for
allegedly committing "acts of moral turpitude." The Journal is the
official publication of the State Bar of California.</LD>
<LD>   Torres "stipulated in two matters that he misused his client trust
account by depositing attorney fees in it and by writing checks
against it for personal expenses," according to the Journal.</LD>
<TE>   Torres -- an ally of Villaraigosa's opponent, City Councilman Nick
Pacheco -- dismissed the bar's allegations against him as frivolous
on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Torres, 37, has claimed responsibility for mailing fliers to 14th
Council District voters attacking Villaraigosa with racially charged
criticisms and accusations of marital infidelities.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco has disavowed the ads, but added that he has no control
over Torres' actions. He also tacitly backed up the accusations by
characterizing them as factual.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco's denial that he helped craft the ads has not stopped a
barrage of criticism against him by local officials who have sought
to end the vitriol. Villaraigosa has filed formal complaints with
city and county officials accusing Torres of working in concert with
Pacheco on the mailers.</TE>
<TE>   Again Tuesday, much of the city and county's political
establishment came down hard on Torres and Pacheco.</TE>
<TE>   Alma Martinez, chief of staff for county Supervisor Gloria Molina,
said that because of the fliers, Molina has decided to endorse
Villaraigosa. Besides insulting Villaraigosa, the mailers accused the
supervisor of benefiting from "government sweetheart deals."</TE>
<TE>   During an afternoon news conference in Van Nuys, Los Angeles Mayor
James K. Hahn, a Pacheco supporter, also strongly denounced the
mailers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've seen enough of this kind of negative campaigning,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco's colleagues on the City Council also criticized the tenor
of the fliers.</TE>
<TE>   "As an elected official, I deplore these racially charged
attacks," City Councilman Jack Weiss said.</TE>

<HD>Suspected Rapist Was Convicted of Similar Crime</HD>
<DH>The man arrested on suspicion of 31 assaults pleaded guilty
to false imprisonment of a Long Beach woman more than a decade ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Wride</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The man who authorities believe is the so-called Belmont Shore serial
rapist responsible for attacking 31 women pleaded guilty 13 years ago
to a bizarre crime at a Long Beach woman's home that eerily
foreshadows the cases for which he is expected to be charged today.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Wayne Rathbun, 32, of Long Beach was arrested on suspicion of
rape and burglary Sunday in connection with 31 sexual assaults on
women in Seattle, Long Beach, Los Alamitos and Huntington Beach since
1996. Police said the suspect would often enter a victim's home while
nude or clad only in underwear.</LD>
<LD>   DNA evidence from a dozen of those attacks matched DNA obtained
from Rathbun after the most recent attack in Long Beach last week,
police said.</LD>
<TE>   Had DNA testing been more sophisticated -- and had the collection
of DNA samples from felony suspects been mandatory in 1989 -- "we
might have caught this guy 30 attacks ago," said Deputy Dist. Atty.
Richard Goul.</TE>
<TE>   Rathbun, who lived with his mother in an Elm Avenue apartment
about three miles from the Belmont Shore and Belmont Heights
neighborhoods where many of the attacks occurred, was being held
without bail in Long Beach City Jail.</TE>
<TE>   Goul said Tuesday that it is not yet clear how Rathbun chose his
victims, only that investigators suspect him of advance planning for
the attacks in unlocked homes, given his apparent knowledge of each
site and his ability to escape swiftly.</TE>
<TE>   Although there was no indication of sexual assault, Rathbun's one
felony conviction sheds some light on the man accused of a crime
spree that for years frightened women in several cities.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed only in underwear, according to police reports and court
documents, Rathbun entered the open window of a woman's home on Grand
Avenue at the edge of Belmont Shore about 2:30 a.m. July 28, 1989.</TE>
<TE>   He had argued with his mother and decided to sleep in this
backyard off an alley, he would later tell police. When he grew
hungry, he entered the home. The woman said Rathbun, then 19, pounced
on her and pinned her to the bed, ordered her not to scream, then
said he would not hurt her and told her that he was just hungry. The
woman gave him flour tortillas, Popsicles and frozen turkey.</TE>
<TE>   Rathbun left, and officers searching the neighborhood found him in
a yard on Vista Street, where he had stuffed his frozen food.</TE>
<TE>   Rathbun pleaded guilty a month later to residential burglary and
false imprisonment by using violence -- keeping the woman from
leaving by holding her arm as he talked to her, Goul said.</TE>
<TE>   Rathbun served 10 months in jail and was given three years'
probation.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Unified School District records show that Rathbun
arrived in September 1984 from the Philippines and attended Rogers
Middle School for a year before enrolling at Long Beach Polytechnic
High School in September 1985.</TE>
<TE>   He attended the downtown campus through June 1987 and then dropped
out.</TE>
<TE>   He completed his high school education through the district's
adult school in 1988, district spokesman Dick Van Der Laan said.</TE>

<HD>Judge Bans Book Thief, 85, From Libraries</HD>
<DH>Simi Valley man is placed on three years' probation after
pleading no contest to the theft of 3,500 volumes and videos.</DH>

<LD>It was a fate worse than jail.</LD>
<LD>   By the time the final chapter ended in a Ventura County courtroom
Tuesday afternoon, 85-year-old book thief Ernest Heyneman had been
banned from all area libraries and ordered to hand over his library
card by sundown.</LD>
<LD>   The frail, onetime movie studio employee, who pleaded no contest
to commercial burglary after being accused of stealing more than
3,500 books and videos, had hoped to work a deal that would have
allowed him to return to his favorite reading rooms with the
supervision of an escort.</LD>
<TE>   Ventura County Superior Court Judge Kevin J. McGee rejected that
request but said the longtime Simi Valley resident didn't need
psychological counseling, as prosecutors had sought. McGee called the
four-year theft spree "truly an aberration."</TE>
<TE>   McGee placed Heyneman on three years' probation and banned him
from obtaining any new library cards.</TE>
<TE>   Heyneman's Ventura attorney, Stanley D. Sumalpong, said his client
was remorseful and devastated by the punishment.</TE>
<TE>   "He loves books. He found solace in books," Sumalpong said outside
court. "The penalty is jail for him. Worse than jail."</TE>
<TE>   Heyneman said nothing during or after the proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband is very sorry," said Heyneman's wife, Emma, 75. "He
wants you to know we will do anything you decree ... please use
compassion."</TE>
<TE>   "It's always sad to see a senior citizen committing crime," said
Deputy Dist. Atty. Audrey Rohn, "but we need to protect the libraries
from Mr. Heyneman. He can't control his compulsion to take books."</TE>
<TE>   According to authorities, Heyneman would visit the Simi Valley and
Thousand Oaks libraries regularly, reading and culling the stacks for
hours. He would then check out several books, videos and audiotapes,
take them home and remove the security strips before returning the
borrowed items on time. Heyneman would return to the libraries and
smuggle out the desensitized materials.</TE>
<TE>   In December, after a Thousand Oaks librarian noticed a dearth in
the facility's medical books and eventually made the link to
Heyneman, authorities searched his home on Heyneman Lane and seized
124 boxes of library materials.</TE>

was remorseful and devastated by the punishment.</TE>
<TE>   "He loves books. He found solace in books," Sumalpong said outside
court. "The penalty is jail for him. Worse than jail."</TE>
<TE>   Heyneman, clad in a gray sports coat, matching pants and a
turtleneck sweater, shuffled slowly into court, flanked by his grown
daughter and walking with the assistance of a gold cane and his
petite wife's arm.</TE>
<TE>   Heyneman said nothing during or after the proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband is very sorry," said Heyneman's wife, Emma, 75. "He
wants you to know we will do anything you decree ... please use
compassion."</TE>
<TE>   Although the felony burglary charge to which Heyneman pleaded no
contest was punishable by up to three years in prison, prosecutors
never sought to have him incarcerated.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always sad to see a senior citizen committing crime," said
Deputy Dist. Atty. Audrey Rohn, "but we need to protect the libraries

<TE>   In December, after a Thousand Oaks librarian noticed a dearth in
the facility's medical books and made the link to Heyneman,
authorities searched his historic home on Heyneman Lane and seized
124 boxes of library materials.</TE>
<TE>   The collection included the video "Liberace Live" and the book
"All I Need To Know I Learned From Watching Star Trek."</TE>
<TE>   Sumalpong said his client was an avid reader and particularly
interested in medical books because his two grown daughters each
battled cancer and survived.</TE>
<TE>   In court, Sumalpong said his client's actions also were the result
of getting along in years and possibly a mental condition for which
he offered no evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Rohn wasn't swayed.</TE>
<TE>   "Turning old," she said, "doesn't turn you into a thief."</TE>

<LD>Under fire for having classrooms with up to 50 students, the Board of
Education agreed Tuesday to study the impact of increasing class
sizes and the possibility of reversing course.</LD>
<LD>   The 60-day review will focus on the effect of reducing class sizes
to an average of 37 students. Reeling from state budget cuts, a
divided school board voted in March to increase class sizes by two
students in grades 4-12 to save $48 million, part of $450 million
package in cuts.</LD>

<LD>A 6-year-old girl trapped in a washing machine that was filling with
water was rescued Tuesday by a passer-by who smashed the glass window
with a tire iron.</LD>
<LD>   The girl was at a coin-operated laundry with her mother when she
climbed into the front-loading machine and the door closed.</LD>
<LD>   As the washer begin to fill, Kloeum Nhem saw her and tried to
smash the glass with his arm. When that failed, he got a tire iron
from his car.</LD>
<TE>   He was treated at a hospital for cuts to his arm, and the girl
underwent surgery for cuts to her face and body. She was in stable
condition.</TE>

<LD>The county Department of Health Services wants the Board of
Supervisors to delay until January a decision on whether to close two
of the county's four full-service hospitals.</LD>
<LD>   In a memo Tuesday, the department cited the passage of Measure B,
which will raise property taxes and garner about $168 million for
trauma and emergency care. The supervisors will vote Tuesday on
turning Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and Olive View-UCLA Medical Center

<HD>Lessons on Law Help Teens Find Right Side of It</HD>
<DH>Whittier Law School students get experience in classrooms
and provide at-risk young people with practical information.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Eves and his friends assumed that police often pull over and
search carloads of young black men on Orange County streets. So they
didn't protest when it happened to them last year.</LD>
<LD>   Now the 17-year-old student at Foothill High School in Tustin
knows they didn't have to consent automatically to the search
because, he says, there was no reasonable suspicion that they had
done anything wrong. He learned that during a class on civilians'
rights that Whittier Law School students are teaching at high schools
around Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Through that Street Law program, third-year law student Jill Rizzo
teaches Foothill High's special education students for two hours each
week about the legal system and how it affects them. The project
started at Georgetown University's law school about 30 years ago and
has since expanded worldwide to about 50 law schools.</LD>
<TE>   Although Street Law classes offered by other law schools are often
provided to high school honors students or those involved in mock
trial competition, the Whittier program focuses on at-risk students,
including those with learning disabilities or previous disciplinary
problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of them are one step away from jail," said Stephen Rochford,
an attorney who runs Whittier's Street Law courses. "We want to teach
them about their responsibilities and the consequences of their
actions to deter them from getting in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   For James, learning about his rights is as relevant as his lessons
in academic subjects.</TE>
<TE>   "The math and stuff is important, but what I learn in this class
is what helps me when I'm on the streets," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Street Law curriculum covers practical subject matter,
including consumer protection and constitutional rights, adapted to a
student's perspective. Students are taught how to successfully handle
everyday legal problems, how to both solve and avoid them.</TE>
<TE>   A session on consumer law included information on a person's
rights if a recently purchased stereo is broken, and one on family
matters dealt with how to get legally emancipated.</TE>
<TE>   Whittier Law School started participating in the program about
three years ago. Rochford trained the nine students teaching Street
Law this semester before assigning each to one class at an Orange
County or Los Angeles County school, where they will teach until the
end of this month.</TE>
<TE>   Rizzo uses interactive lessons such as a true-false quiz to get
students participating. During a recent lesson on suspects' rights,
two groups buzzed with debate after statements such as "Police can
search a trunk without reasonable suspicion" -- false -- and "Police
are allowed to search rooms adjacent to a suspect's location when
arresting that person" -- true.</TE>
<TE>   Rizzo, a wiry 24-year-old in khaki jeans and a white T-shirt,
zipped around the room to keep the 11 students in the class engaged.</TE>
<TE>   Her blond hair fell in her face as she pointed a finger at one
student to simulate a weapon and later turned to their regular
Foothill teacher, Gary Robson, to name him as a potential murder
suspect. She then went over theoretical arrest procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Concentrating intently on Rizzo's statements was 14-year-old Karen
Izquierdo, her fingers poised to lift the appropriate answer card for
each, one marked "true" and the other "false." She had decorated her
team's cards with bright red cherries that matched her cardigan and
tube top.</TE>
<TE>   "Knowing this stuff means cops can't take advantage of you because
you don't know what the rules are," she said. "These are things I've
always wanted to know about, but it's not like you can go up to a cop
and ask them these things without them thinking you're planning
trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Student Joe Angulo grunted proudly whenever he provided the right
answer to his team.</TE>
<TE>   "Ooh, ooh, who's the man?" said the 18-year-old at one point. He
later proclaimed himself the "master of disaster" when he knew that
police, for their own protection against weapons, can search anywhere
in a car within a suspect's reach.</TE>
<TE>   Although he hasn't gotten in trouble with the police in a couple
of years, Angulo said his new knowledge empowers him because he knows
exactly what he and the officers have a right to do. So, he added, he
is less likely to confront officers about perceived injustices.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm on their level now with the information I have," he said.
"This class really keeps my attention because I'm learning things
that are useful."</TE>
<TE>   Rizzo said the Foothill students have been especially interested
in learning about their rights while they are in cars: when they can
be pulled over, whether their belongings can be searched, when they
must submit to blood tests.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to teaching about their rights if they should get into
trouble, Rizzo explains the consequences of crimes to discourage
students from getting into trouble in the first place. But rather
than being a sort of jailhouse law seminar, the class emphasizes
legal literacy and good citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not teaching them how to get around the law," she said. "I'm
teaching them about the law and why they should respect it."</TE>
<TE>   Treading a fine line between being lawyers and teachers, the
Whittier students cannot give legal advice. Rizzo told her students
the first day that she could not dispense any opinions on real-life
circumstances, whether about domestic abuse or a situation such as
James experienced in the car with his friends.</TE>
<TE>   Teaching the class also helps the law students learn to
communicate complex information to future clients, Rochford said.</TE>
<TE>   "Explaining legal issues to teenagers enhances their own
understanding and gives them some perspective on what the average
person knows about the law -- which isn't much," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Street Law program gives Rizzo one of her few opportunities as
a law student to help others, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Law school kind of makes people focus only on themselves with all
the reading and the papers," she said. "This is a way to get us out
in the community caring about somebody besides ourselves."</TE>

<HD>Move to Bigger Class Sizes to Get a Second Look</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Pierson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under fire for having classrooms with up to 50 students, the Los
Angeles Board of Education agreed Tuesday to study the results of an
earlier decision to increase class sizes and possibly reverse course.</LD>
<LD>   "In light of overcrowding, I think the last thing we should have
done was increase class size," said board member Jose Huizar, who
proposed the class-size study.</LD>
<LD>   The 60-day review will focus on reducing class sizes to an average
of 37 students.</LD>
<TE>   Reeling from state budget cuts, a divided school board voted in
March to increase class sizes by two students in grades four through
12 to save $48 million, part of a $450-million budget cut package.</TE>
<TE>   But many have criticized the move for making an already bad
situation worse and for harming the quality of education.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-two percent of the district's middle and high school
academic classes now have 30 students or more.</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday's board meeting, about two dozen parents, teachers and
students voiced their support for smaller classes.</TE>
<TE>   "You've poisoned the educational environment," said Jay Gussin, a
science teacher at Frost Middle School in Granada Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Delgado, a seventh-grader at Nimitz Middle School in
Huntington Park, burst into tears when he told board members about
crowding at his school.</TE>
<TE>   But Supt. Roy Romer defended the class-size increase, saying it
was the only way the 730,000-student district could afford a 3% pay
increase negotiated with the teachers' union.</TE>
<TE>   Romer also said the larger classes created 6,500 badly needed
seats in the high schools and 11,500 in middle schools.</TE>
<TE>   "We all need to take a dose of reality here," Romer said. "If we
tie our hands too tightly in terms of expectation, you'll find you'll
hurt other reforms in the district."</TE>
<TE>   A reduction of class size largely depends upon the district's
ability to hire more teachers and build schools, a challenge made
more difficult by further cutbacks expected from the state next year,
board members said.</TE>
<TE>   But the district received a major boost last week when voters
approved a $3.35-billion bond for school construction. The bond will
pay for 80 new schools.</TE>
<TE>   Until new high schools are completed in 2005, however, many
schools will have to grapple with overcrowding.</TE>
<TE>   United Teachers-Los Angeles President John Perez said larger class
sizes could have been prevented if the district had managed its money
better.</TE>
<TE>   "Hundreds of millions of dollars has been spent on consultants and
lawyers" and the new district headquarters downtown, Perez said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our position that class-size increases should never have
been done," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, the board rescinded an unpopular plan to rebalance
the number of teachers in the district by moving some to schools
deemed more needy of instructors.</TE>
<TE>   The plan has been criticized because of the disruption it would
cause students if their teachers were reassigned.</TE>

<HD>Activists Protest L.A. County's Plan to Shut Down
Rehabilitation Center</HD>
<DH>Health workers and an alliance of the disabled rally to
keep Rancho Los Amigos open.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Richardson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors voted to close Rancho Los
Amigos National Rehabilitation Center late last month, a movement to
save the center has been percolating throughout the county and state,
particularly among the disabled.</LD>
<LD>   Health workers, independent living centers, and an alliance of
people with spinal cord injuries, cerebral palsy and diabetes and
other ailments and injuries treated at Rancho are rallying to keep
the 207-bed Downey center open.</LD>
<LD>   Kathleen Austria, an official in the union that represents 19,000
county health workers, said many people felt blindsided by the
supervisors' Oct. 29 vote. "People went from shock to anger and now
they're ready to fight, " said Austria, who is a rehabilitation nurse
at County-USC Medical Center.</LD>
<TE>   Since transportation is difficult for many people with
disabilities, organizing the thousands of people opposed to closing
Rancho has occurred mainly through teleconferences, letter-writing
campaigns and online petitions. Demonstrations led by the health
workers union are planned at Rancho on Monday and at the supervisors'
meeting Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In Pasadena, Fran Ozer, 42, is blitzing the supervisors daily with
angry letters and e-mail. A year ago, she was a patient at Rancho
after emergency back surgery left her paralyzed below the waist. At
the time she did not have insurance, and the county covered her
nine-week stay, at a cost of $4,700 a day, until Medi-Cal later paid
most of the bill and she was left with a share. Ozer, who is a
curatorial assistant at the Skirball Cultural Center, credits
"amazing physical and occupational therapists" at Rancho for her
turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   "The money they vested in me was well spent; I am now back at
work, paying taxes, completely off state support and walking with
braces and crutches," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Corvan, executive director of the ALS Assn. of Greater Los
Angeles, said his organization is "doing everything we can to save
Rancho." (ALS is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, often called Lou
Gehrig's disease.) "All of our patients are terminal when they get
this diagnosis, and the compassion and love" they get at Rancho is so
important for people grappling with the disease, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The 450 members are participating in the letter-writing campaign
but their hopes are not high that the county will reverse the closure
decision. "I'm afraid it feels like we're fighting a bureaucracy,"
Corvan said.</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Los Amigos treats about 9,500 people each year for a
variety of catastrophic injuries and ailments including stroke and
diabetes, liver problems, and spinal cord and head injuries. The
county health department predicts closing it will save $58.6 million
next year and then $65 million to $70 million annually.</TE>
<TE>   Although they voted to close Rancho, the supervisors also agreed
to hire an independent consultant to examine the health services
department's fiscal analysis of the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have more data to assess soon and I'm open to what the
numbers show," said Dr. Thomas Garthwaite, health department
director.</TE>
<TE>   Garthwaite said he sympathizes with all the people and
organizations lobbying him and the supervisors to keep Rancho Los
Amigos.</TE>
<TE>   "I know many people are upset about this, and Rancho's excellence
is not at all at issue," Garthwaite said. "But I came here with a
clear mandate to solve this budget situation and prevent this kind of
crisis from recurring."</TE>
<TE>   At Southern California Rehabilitation Services, which provides
help for disabled people to live independently, officials are
rallying their 1,000 clients to argue that the county ultimately will
spend more on their health care if Rancho closes.</TE>
<TE>   "We are connecting with each of our clients to determine exactly
how many will suffer from this," said Sandy Chu, community advocate
at the center, which is located directly across the street from the
Rancho campus.</TE>
<TE>   Some organizations outside Los Angeles County are rallying to
Rancho's cause for practical reasons. The California Foundation for
Independent Living Centers, a statewide nonprofit group in
Sacramento, relies on Rancho Los Amigos for its expertise about
technology that allows people who are paralyzed to drive and engage
in other everyday activities.</TE>
<TE>   "If Rancho closes, it will take with it half the statewide
assisted technology network," said the foundation's Patricia Yaeger.</TE>
<TE>   The rush to organize opposition to Rancho's closing illustrates
the disabled community's lack of political clout, said Sean Casey
O'Brien, co-founder of Unique People's Voting Project and KPFK radio
talk show host who focuses on disability issues.</TE>
<TE>   "What's really sad is about a million and a half of disabled
citizens of voting age in Los Angeles are silent," he said "If we
could get a quarter of them out to vote this wouldn't happen--they
wouldn't dare."</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles police homicide investigators announced a $25,000 reward
Tuesday for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the
2001 slaying of a 16-year-old girl who was nine months' pregnant.</LD>
<LD>   The slaying of Wendy Cortez is believed to be gang-related,
although Det. Fred Faustino said Cortez was not a gang member.</LD>
<LD>   Cortez was shot in front of a friend's home in the 2700 block of
Hyans Street in Echo Park, and gave birth to a son who was two weeks
premature.</LD>
<TE>   The boy died nine days later of wounds from the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother and other family members, including her 2-year-old son,
gathered Tuesday in front of Rampart Division headquarters for the
announcement.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't want anyone to go through what we have in the past
year. Somebody's still out there who did this, and we are asking
anyone who knows anything about what happened to help the
investigators," her brother Willie Cortez said.</TE>
<TE>   Faustino asked that anyone with any information about the killings
call LAPD detectives at (213) 207-2051 during business hours or a
toll-free 24-hour number, (877) 529-3855.</TE>

<HD>Prosecutors Widen EIDC Probe</HD>
<DH>Nine search warrants are served for bank accounts and
credit cards of the Pittsburgh Film Office and its director.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County district attorney's investigation into the
Entertainment Industry Development Corp. expanded Tuesday when nine
more search warrants were served on banks in Pittsburgh.</LD>
<LD>   The move is the latest in an ongoing investigation by county
prosecutors into whether the EIDC and its president, Cody Cluff,
misused public funds. The agency coordinates movie permits for the
city and county and promotes filming in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the district attorney's office,
said the warrants were for the bank accounts and credit cards of the
Pittsburgh Film Office and Director Dawn Keezer.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, investigators seized records from a Pittsburgh art
gallery, the Pittsburgh Film Office and Keezer's home, alleging in
court documents that she may have conspired with Cluff to
misappropriate public funds.</TE>
<TE>   Keezer is chairman of Film US, the national movie advocacy group
whose legitimacy is being questioned by the district attorney's
office. Cluff serves as the secretary of the group of 196 film
commissioners, who seek to keep film and television production inside
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Since the raids last week, Pittsburgh city officials have asked
for an audit of the Pittsburgh Film Office while Los Angeles Mayor
James K. Hahn, county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky and Councilwoman
Wendy Greuel have urged that Cluff resign or be put on administrative
leave. Cluff has not resigned, and there has been no vote taken by
the board.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called rollback warrants for electronic searches at the
banks were prompted by information gleaned from the earlier
Pittsburgh raid, according to the district attorney's office. Two
search warrants were also issued Tuesday by the Allegheny County
district attorney's office, prompted by Pittsburgh city officials'
request for an audit.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe that she has done anything improper, and I don't
fully understand the frenzy in Pittsburgh," said Keezer's lawyer,
William Manifesto. "I'm satisfied that when it's all done, there will
be no allegations of any wrongdoing."</TE>
<TE>   Cluff's attorney declined to comment Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Fairgrounds CEO Is Forced Out on Leave</HD>
<DH>Action against Roger Gibbs is the result of an apparent
dispute with some board members. Raceway fans decry the removal of an
ally.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The chief executive officer of Ventura County's fairgrounds was
forced out on leave Tuesday in a power struggle between himself and
several board members.</LD>
<LD>   The action against Roger Gibbs signaled a deep division on the
Fair Board, taking at least three of its nine members by surprise.
Board President Greg Carson declined comment, citing a state law
barring discussion of personnel matters.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, one of the most contentious issues before the
board -- a contract renewal for auto racing at the fairgrounds --
appeared closer to settlement.</LD>
<TE>   A board committee recommended approval of a one-year lease for Jim
Naylor, operator of Ventura Auto Raceway. The raceway has been
criticized for generating too much noise and bringing in too little
money.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear whether the action against Gibbs was linked to his
support for the raceway, an operation opposed by the board's
leadership. But racing fans and longtime fair volunteers saw his
forced leave as part of an effort by a board faction to push
traditional, low-profit community activities out of the 62-acre
Seaside Park fairgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd like to see it all go away," said Craig Fosdick, the
fair's longtime large-livestock superintendent. "They'd like to
decimate the fair and fly in the face of a tradition that goes back
nearly 100 years."</TE>
<TE>   Fosdick said that Carson, a former mayor of Ventura, and board
Vice President Ginger Gherardi, head of the Ventura County
Transportation Commission, "have done the fair no favors and should
be replaced immediately."</TE>
<TE>   With a long-term master plan in the works for Seaside Park, some
board members and area business people are discussing new directions
for the fairgrounds, a collection of aging Quonset huts, stables and
an open-air arena used for racing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's 2003 and the fairgrounds needs to reflect economic reality,"
Carson said Tuesday. "We need to provide an entertainment venue that
crosses a broader section of the community. Ventura deserves to not
necessarily have a raceway in the center of town; maybe we've
outgrown it."</TE>
<TE>   A park, a convention center and a concert amphitheater have come
up as possible uses for the site. But races at the fairgrounds go
back decades and typify the property's down-home appeal, contended
dozens of Gibbs' supporters, who gathered Tuesday afternoon in the
fairgrounds' parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   "Gibbs is one of the best things that's ever happened here, and he
happens to believe that racing is good for the fairgrounds," said
racing enthusiast Dean Cook. On the other hand, Carson and Gherardi
have "no patience, no compassion and no tolerance for learning their
jobs and listening to people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Others contended that the two had been rude to Gibbs in public
meetings, interrupting his remarks repeatedly.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd had come to show its support for Gibbs at a special
board meeting called to hash out the differences between the CEO and
the board. They also meant to rally around Naylor, whose 25-year
racing operation seemed to be hurtling toward its demise.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting was canceled just three hours before it was to start.
Even so, Fair Board members C. Patrick Askay, Janice Berk and Craig
Underwood were on hand to offer a more personal greeting than a
"Meeting Canceled" note.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew a lot of people would be here and we came by to listen to
them," Berk said.</TE>
<TE>   The three said they had not been consulted by their fellow board
members on the decision to place Gibbs on paid leave. Gibbs could not
be reached for comment. Asked if he felt left out, Askay, a former
fair assistant manager, responded: "To say the least."</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs' future at Seaside Park could be discussed at the board's
Nov. 19 meeting, said board spokesman Devlin Raley. However, the
timing of that discussion is uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   The raceway's renewal is likely to be up for a vote by the full
board at that meeting. The contract limits the track's 2003 operation
to 25 days and would require it to close earlier than in past years
to stem noise complaints, Naylor said.</TE>

<HD>Falcons' Talon Show Scatters Gulls</HD>
<DH>Four of the predators are loosed upon a large and polluting
shorebird population at a San Juan Capistrano landfill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stanley Allison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Well, there goes the neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   Four falcons -- put on the county payroll as part of a five-month
experiment to rid a San Juan Capistrano landfill of thousands of
gulls -- moved in Tuesday and quickly showed who's boss, harassing
and bullying the longtime residents.</LD>
<LD>   As soon as one of the trained falcons was released, the California
gulls, considered a menace by employees and a potential source of
bacterial pollution by county officials, took to the air.</LD>
<TE>   "While he's in the air, the gulls don't feel comfortable on the
ground," said David Knudson, owner of KlearView Resources, the
Spokane, Wash., company that supplies the falcons.</TE>
<TE>   The lanner and saker falcons, Knudson said, should quickly
establish aerial domination, and the gulls will just as quickly
develop a healthy fear of the county dump.</TE>
<TE>   Using falcons to scare off lesser birds is not new. Knudson's
falcons have been employed at landfills and military bases throughout
the West.</TE>
<TE>   And the mission is always the same: clear the airspace.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll have to go back to what they naturally do for food, which
is not eat at a dump," said Knudson of his target. "They now have to
learn to live and forage someplace else."</TE>
<TE>   Which is just what the county's Integrated Waste Management
Department, which operates the landfill, wants.</TE>
<TE>   The gulls, along with a sprinkling of crows, pigeons, starlings
and other scavengers, have dined at the landfill since it opened in
1976. Feasting on the 2,300 or so tons of municipal waste dumped
there daily, the gulls wreak havoc on vehicles and employees, making
things, well, messy.</TE>
<TE>   The landfill is three miles from the sea and near the ocean-bound
San Juan Creek. The thousands of gulls and other birds that leave
their droppings throughout the 1,530-acre landfill create potential
health, safety and water-quality hazards.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the county has tried many scare tactics to chase
away the gulls, including:</TE>
<TE>   * A zone gun, which resembles a small cannon that creates a noise
at preset intervals. The birds got used to it and ignored it.</TE>
<TE>   * Bird wire, strung above the working area on poles in a
crisscross fashion. The birds figured out that they could walk under
it.</TE>
<TE>   * Flash tape, a reflective material that hangs from the wire to
scare them. Again, they ignored it and walked under it to get to the
garbage.</TE>
<TE>   * Bird distress calls, broadcast from an earthmover equipped with
a loudspeaker. The birds adapted and ignored it.</TE>
<TE>   * Kaleidoscope lights, like at a disco. That lasted about half a
day before it became clear they wouldn't do the trick.</TE>
<TE>   * Inflatable owls placed around the site. The birds got used to
them.</TE>
<TE>   * Whistles and noisemakers. They got used to them.</TE>
<TE>   * Cracker shells, very loud explosions from a shotgun. Neighbors
complained about the noise, and the department discontinued their
use.</TE>
<TE>   With few options left, county officials turned to Knudson, who has
rid other West Coast landfills of problem birds.</TE>
<TE>   The falconer, who has 18 birds, has contracts with about six
landfills and military bases in the West.</TE>
<TE>   The falcons do not necessarily harm the gulls, unless the birds
unwisely choose to ignore the raptors.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about scaring birds as opposed to killing them,"
Knudson said.</TE>
<TE>   His falcons -- Ahmed, the Prince, Wanda and Faith -- will be at
the landfill five or six days a week, flying in 20-minute shifts.</TE>
<TE>   The falcons are territorial and aggressive, handy traits in the
gull operation.</TE>
<TE>   Put up against gulls and other lesser birds, the falcons -- which
Knudson said have been clocked at 227 mph in a full dive -- will take
control of the area almost immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "They're all about force," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The gulls and other scavenger birds will look elsewhere for their
food.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know where," Knudson said. "They'll probably go back to
the ocean where they belong. We've created an unnatural food source
and an unnatural population of gulls."</TE>
<TE>   As they are forced to abandon the dump as a food supply, the
population will eventually thin to natural levels, he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the five-month, $40,000 experiment, Knudson and
county officials will assess its effectiveness. If the falcons have
worked, the falconer will return periodically to maintain the
friendly skies.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tom Wilson, who observed the falcons' inaugural
flights, was impressed. "We can demonstrate that we're being
proactive rather than reactive," he said. "This looks like an
effective way of improving this space."</TE>

the ocean where they belong. We've created an unnatural food source
and an unnatural population of gulls."</TE>
<TE>   As they are forced to abandon the dump as a food supply, the
population will eventually thin to natural levels, he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the five-month, $40,000 experiment, Knudson and
county officials will assess its effectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   If the falcons have worked, the falconer will return periodically
to maintain the friendly skies.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tom Wilson, who observed the falcons' inaugural
flights, was impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "We can demonstrate that we're being proactive rather than
reactive," he said. "This looks like an effective way of improving
this space."</TE>

<HD>Judge Drops Frog Habitat Protections</HD>
<DH>Four million acres, home to the imperiled red-legged frog,
are opened to development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has eliminated protection of
nearly 4 million acres of habitat in 28 California counties for the
imperiled red-legged frog, the athletic amphibian immortalized in
Mark Twain's story "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County."</LD>
<LD>   The frog, the largest in the Western United States, has been on
the endangered species list since 1996, its plummeting population
attributed to the steady loss of wetlands throughout much of the
state.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Richard Leon issued his ruling after the Bush
administration proposed a settlement with industry groups, asserting
that the frogs would not be irreparably harmed.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling paves the way for developers to bulldoze, grade and
otherwise alter land considered vital to the species' survival.
Developers still must obtain special permits, however, before taking
any action that could kill individual frogs. Most of the affected
land is in the San Francisco Bay Area and is privately owned.</TE>
<TE>   About 200,000 acres of public land in the Angeles National Forest
and portions of national forests in the Sierra Nevada will remain
protected.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling is the latest in a series of recent rollbacks of
habitat protection for dozens of threatened and endangered species,
delighting developers and infuriating environmental groups.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very pleased," said Richard Campos, general counsel for the
Home Builders Assns. of Northern California, which along with the
California Chambers of Commerce and the Alliance for Jobs, sued the
U.S. Interior Department to nullify the habitat designation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a serious blow to the protection of the California
red-legged frog and aquatic and wetland areas throughout California,"
said Peter Galvin, of the Center for Biological Diversity, which has
sued the government successfully dozens of times to have critical
habitat designated for imperiled species, including the red-legged
frog.</TE>
<TE>   "An important layer of protection has been removed," Galvin said.
"This is part of a trend of industry groups suing to undo
environmental protections, and the Bush administration falling all
over themselves to reach sweetheart settlement deals."</TE>
<TE>   In this case, as in several others, the administration agreed with
developers that the federal government failed to adequately assess
the economic impacts of restricting development on large areas of
land.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal law, the costs to industry and the public of
designating critical habitat for an endangered species must be
considered, and if they outweigh the benefit to the species, then
habitat need not be designated.</TE>
<TE>   A report prepared by two UC Berkeley economists for the
home-builders group concluded that economic losses because of
construction delays or cancellation caused by the frog habitat would
average $100 million a year, or $2 billion over 20 years. U.S. Fish
and Wildlife consultants had estimated far lower annual figures of $5
million a year.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the settlement of the frog case, Leon ordered the Fish
and Wildlife Service, a division of the Interior Department, to redo
its economic impact analyses by 2004 and decide by 2005 whether the
costs outweigh the benefits of protecting the frogs' habitat.</TE>
<TE>   The judge in his ruling cited arguments by the Fish and Wildlife
Service that no serious harm would come to the frogs during the study
period.</TE>
<TE>   Critical habitat, one of the most contested parts of the
Endangered Species Act, requires mapping out what land is necessary
for the species' survival. Proposed projects on private lands
designated as critical habitat can be halted if they involve the use
of federal funds for roads, or have other federal connections.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, various industry groups have successfully sued
to overturn critical habitat protections for dozens of fish, bird and
insect species, in California and other Western states.</TE>
<TE>   Many but not all judges have been following the lead of the 10th
Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled in May 2001 that the process
used to designate critical habitat did not adequately analyze
economic impacts on property owners and others who make a living from
the land.</TE>
<TE>   Judges have vacated critical habitat for 19 salmon species, the
cactus ferruginous pygmy owl, the Southwestern willow flycatcher, the
arroyo Southwestern toad, and the San Diego fairy shrimp.</TE>
<TE>   In two cases, courts have ordered economic analyses to be redone
but kept critical habitat designations in place. Pending cases in
which industry groups are seeking to invalidate critical habitat
involve the Western snowy plover, the Northern spotted owl, the
marbled murrelet, the Alameda whip snake, the Arkansas River shiner
and the loach minnow.</TE>
<TE>   Fish and Wildlife spokesman Mitch Snow dismissed
environmentalists' charges that the Bush administration was
orchestrating the successful challenges to critical habitat. "How can
you have a sweetheart deal when it's a judge ruling, not the Bush
administration? There are three branches of government, there is a
separation of powers here."</TE>
<TE>   Snow said federal officials are "caught between a rock and hard
place," between competing lawsuits by environmentalists and
developers over critical habitat. At the same time, Snow said, his
agency hasn't received enough funds from Congress to adequately
analyze habitat needs or economic impacts.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last several years, fish and wildlife officials have lost
dozens of lengthy, costly lawsuits brought by environmentalists to
have critical habitat designated, only to have industry groups turn
around and sue them to have the designations undone.</TE>
<TE>   Snow said it was no surprise that the economic analysis argument
was holding up in court.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost predictable if you don't have enough time and money
to do this right, and courts are saying, 'Well, do it anyway.' Well,
surprise, people are going to sue."</TE>

<CX>   Endangered species -- A California section story Wednesday about
changes in habitat protection for the red-legged frog and other
endangered species misidentified the general counsel of the Home
Builders Assns. of Northern California. His name is Paul Campos, not
Richard Campos. The story also incorrectly named the species that had
lost critical habitat protection. It is the Riverside fairy shrimp,
not the San Diego fairy shrimp.</CX>

<HD>Suit Against Grower Intensifies Guest-Worker Program Debate</HD>
<DH>Under federal law, foreigners may be brought in on
temporary visas for a company suffering a labor shortage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lee Romney</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lawsuit against a north San Diego County tomato grower has become
the latest salvo in the debate over a federal program that allows
foreign workers to come to the United States to offset temporary
labor shortages.</LD>
<LD>   Only two agricultural companies in California have used the
guest-worker program -- a controversial component of congressional
immigration reform -- and both have now been sued. Farm-worker
advocates say the temporary visa program invites abuses of both
foreign and domestic workers and that immigration reform should focus
instead on helping to legalize workers already in the U.S. labor
force.</LD>
<LD>   The agricultural industry "would like to transform the farm labor
force into a force of guest workers rather than legal residents,"
said Bruce Goldstein, co-executive director of the Farmworker Justice
Fund in Washington, D.C. "That's really what this fight is about."</LD>
<TE>   But industry representatives counter that the lawsuits underscore
the need to make the program less bureaucratic for growers. The
farmers say it has been increasingly difficult to find dependable
workers because of a post-Sept. 11 immigration crackdown and because
legal workers are increasingly moving into more stable -- and less
grueling -- jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's turning out that anyone who decides to enter that program is
literally drawing a target on their chests and inviting lawsuits for
infractions," said Eric Larson, executive director of the San Diego
County Farm Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent lawsuit was filed on behalf of immigrant farm
workers who were laid off from their jobs at Harry Singh &amp; Sons in
September, just days before 168 laborers were brought in from Mexico
under the federal guest-worker program to replace them.</TE>
<TE>   Singh attorney Merrill "Rick" Storms said the company was reeling
from Border Patrol raids on its immigrant work force and facing a
looming tomato harvest when it applied in July to bring in the
Mexican laborers. Permission was granted by the U.S. Department of
Labor to do so beginning Sept. 26. Meanwhile, the grower bused
workers from the Coachella Valley in Riverside to its fields.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit alleges that on Sept. 21, the Coachella workers were
told the bus service would be discontinued, and that they could keep
their jobs only if they found housing near the company's leased
fields at the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base.</TE>
<TE>   According to the lawsuit, Singh failed to offer the displaced
workers, who had immigration papers, the same free housing and higher
wages that the company was offering the foreign workers. The suit
also alleges that working conditions were diminished by the
elimination of bus service and a failure to make good-faith efforts
to recruit domestic workers.</TE>
<TE>   "They were terminated from their jobs in anticipation of the guest
workers' coming in to fill their positions," said Cynthia Rice,
litigation director for California Rural Legal Assistance, which
filed the action now pending in U.S. District Court in San Diego.
"When local workers went over to apply for work, they were basically
given the runaround."</TE>
<TE>   Rice stressed that her organization is not taking a position on
the visa program, which California growers are pushing to liberalize.
However, "if this is going to be a program that is used in
California, then the U.S. Department of Labor is going to have to
start paying attention" to labor violations, she said.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge late last month ordered Singh &amp; Sons to offer the
free housing and $8.02-an-hour jobs to the Coachella workers, who had
been earning $6.75 an hour. Storms said the company believed it had
made such an offer to the workers, but may not have communicated
effectively. It has now sent the workers letters offering them jobs,
but Rice said most have families and cannot relocate to the coast.</TE>
<TE>   About 45,000 agricultural workers a year come to the U.S. under
the guest-worker program, mostly to North Carolina and Florida. In
California, the program has mainly been used to import a steady
trickle of Peruvian shepherds. But in the past year, growers have
sought to use it too. A Santa Paula labor contractor who imported
Mexican workers earlier this year is believed to have been the first
in the agricultural industry to use the program on a large scale. He
too was sued by California Rural Legal Assistance -- which alleged
that he failed to provide adequate breaks and to pay Mexican lemon
pickers wages required under California law.</TE>
<TE>   Like that contractor, Storms said the undocumented status of much
of the Singh &amp; Sons work force prompted the company to turn to the
visa program. About two-thirds of the tomato grower's fields are
leased from Camp Pendleton, and post-Sept. 11 immigration crackdowns
at the Marine Corps base revealed that many workers had false
documents. Immigration officials boarded the company's bus in July as
it entered the base and detained three-fourths of the workers, Storms
said.</TE>
<TE>   Storms said the company lost $2.5 million when the labor shortage
left the grower unable to properly tend the tomato crop. Farm-worker
advocates contend that there are available workers who would take
such jobs.</TE>

<HD>Wrong Man on Trial for Murder, Lawyer Argues</HD>
<DH>Sides sum up in the slaying of a Ventura clerk. Prosecutor
insists the defendant and his cousin were the masked gunmen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura County prosecutor urged a jury Tuesday to convict a
five-time felon of first-degree murder for allegedly storming a
neighborhood market last year and fatally shooting a clerk during a
botched robbery.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Don Glynn told jurors in his closing argument
that defendant Richard Geise and his now-deceased cousin, Alfonso
Delgado, were the masked robbers who killed Alejandro Alvarez and
wounded two others during a holdup at Ventura's Central Market.</LD>
<LD>   But Geise's attorney said prosecutors have the wrong man and asked
jurors to acquit his 33-year-old client.</LD>
<TE>   "If ever there was a case of reasonable doubt, this is it," Robert
Schwartz argued.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz cited testimony from two defense witnesses who identified
another man as the possible killer. They told the jury that Sam
Patterson, a friend of Delgado's who died of a drug overdose weeks
after the shooting, admitted being involved in the April 6, 2001,
slaying.</TE>
<TE>   One witness testified that Patterson drunkenly told her: "You know
that thing at the market? I did it."</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz further argued that a west Ventura resident, who
reportedly saw the gunmen outside his house moments before the
robbery, could not identify Geise in court. And Geise's estranged
wife provided an alibi for the midday shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "How can the prosecution attack this evidence?" Schwartz asked in
his summation. "You must find the defendant innocent of this crime."</TE>
<TE>   Glynn found a number of ways to attack the defense case, however.
He portrayed Geise's wife as a liar who concocted a "preposterous"
story about taking her nephews to an amusement park, then racing back
to Ventura to meet her estranged spouse so he could spend time with
their toddler son.</TE>
<TE>   As for the so-called confession, Glynn noted that the defense
witness who allegedly heard Patterson's drunken confession also
testified that Patterson later retracted the remark. The prosecutor
theorized that Patterson may have been involved as an accomplice in
the botched robbery, which could explain a separate statement to his
father about possibly going to prison for murder.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys were all tight," Glynn said. "So it would not be
surprising to any of us to think Sam, in some fashion, was involved
in this."</TE>
<TE>   But Glynn stood firm in his belief that it was Geise -- not
Patterson -- who stormed the market. And he urged jurors to look hard
at the physical evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Less than 18 hours after the shooting, detectives found a
.40-caliber pistol hidden in the ceiling of a Ventura hotel room
where Geise was living. Ballistic tests confirmed it matched a shell
casing recovered inside the market. Similar ammunition was found in
Geise's jacket pocket.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Geise was in possession of one of the guns used in that
robbery," Glynn argued. "That gun was up in the ceiling, matched by
the criminalist, and that is circumstantial evidence that he is one
of the people who committed the robbery."</TE>
<TE>   Geise, a former Ojai resident convicted several times of drug
offenses, is charged with first-degree murder, attempted murder,
attempted robbery, commercial burglary, conspiracy, a firearms
offense, drug possession for sale and subornation of perjury.</TE>

<LD>For the Browns, participating in Special Olympics Southern
California's year-round sports programs has become a family affair.</LD>
<LD>   Eleven-year-old Jeff is the athlete. Three years ago, the Ventura
boy joined the organization, which serves more than 11,000 children
and adults with developmental disabilities. He loves softball, soccer
and bowling.</LD>
<LD>   His mother, Kathy, who works with special education students, is a
coach for several sports and a volunteer in other duties as well. And
his grandmother, Jackie Brown, helps from her wheelchair with
whatever is needed, from setting up awards ceremonies at competitions
to providing meals for athletes and their volunteer coaches.</LD>
<TE>   "My legs don't work, but everything else does, so whenever the
Special Olympics needs something, I say, 'Yes,' " said the
grandmother. She has also enlisted another grandson, age 9, to help
with softball and soccer games. Whenever another daughter visits from
Northern California, she pitches in too.</TE>
<TE>   The organization is part of the international Special Olympics
founded in 1968 by Eunice Kennedy Shriver. The Southern California
group covers 11 counties, providing free opportunities for the
developmentally disabled, ages 8 to 80, to participate in sports.</TE>
<TE>   Melinda London, a regional director for the Culver City-based
organization, said volunteers and donations are essential as the
program strives to include more athletes while facing rising costs
for transportation, uniforms, sports equipment and even medals.</TE>
<TE>   During the holidays, The Times is highlighting organizations that
serve needy youths and families in Southern California as part of its
drive to raise money for worthy causes. Special Olympics Southern
California received $15,000 from the Times Holiday Campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The opportunity to learn a sport and compete with others "gives
parents a new outlook on the potential of their son or daughter,"
London said, "and, with that, the whole family receives support....</TE>
<TE>   "Attitude is a very big part of what we do," she continued. "As
well as learning how to win and lose, our athletes gain the
confidence to move forward in all aspects of their lives. Special
Olympics helps them to be more successful in school and later on,
when they are out there in the work force."</TE>
<TE>   Rodney Walker, a teacher at the Benjamin Banneker Special
Education Center in Los Angeles, spends his weekends coaching several
Special Olympics sports.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives these athletes a lot," he said. "Some of them live in
group homes or foster homes, and they could not get out and do what
they do without Special Olympics."</TE>

<HD>Palmdale May Cite Homeless in Camps</HD>
<DH>Ordinance would help the city better police transients, but
critics say a shelter is needed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Palmdale officials consider a crackdown on transient camps,
critics say the city has done little to help the growing ranks of
homeless.</LD>
<LD>   An ordinance to be discussed tonight by the City Council would
allow authorities to issue misdemeanor citations to homeless people
who camp illegally.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal has stirred debate about homelessness in a city that
in 40 years has been transformed from a rural outpost of alfalfa
farmers to Los Angeles County's fastest-growing city in the 1990s.</LD>
<TE>   Mayor Pro Tem Mike Dispenza said that, while homelessness has not
become an epidemic, it is one of many new urban problems facing the
city.</TE>
<TE>   Dispenza, who supports the ordinance, said homeless people have
begun camping near his insurance office. "It's a problem we've got to
look at," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department asked the city to
create the law to help battle a number of small homeless camps that
have sprouted up around Palmdale.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies and city code enforcement officers say the camps -- which
are often close to businesses and homes -- generate trash and crime,
and lack bathroom facilities.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, homeless advocates have lobbied the city to
soften the ordinance. Dianne Grooms, a United Way vice president for
north Los Angeles County, said that, while Palmdale nonprofits offer
vouchers for short-term hotel stays, the nearest homeless shelter is
in neighboring Lancaster.</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale has been overwhelmed in the last year by a new wave of
homeless single mothers and their children, who are primarily renters
forced from their homes when the properties are sold in a resurgent
housing market, Grooms said.</TE>
<TE>   "The property's being sold and the new owners want to move in,"
she said. "This is a new type of homeless issue."</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale's homeless population numbers in the thousands and is
growing, Grooms said. But sheriff's officials estimate the homeless
population at about 100, and the number of homeless in the illegal
camps as "very small." Deputies say the campers are mostly vagrants
who do not want help. Deputy Donna Levi said the Sheriff's Department
has trouble enforcing existing trespassing ordinances because they
require the assistance of the vacant-lot owners, who often live out
of state. The new law would allow them to cite campers without the
property owners' compliance, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Levi said the Antelope Valley has adequate services to help the
homeless, "but we're only talking about [citing] the people who
refuse to get any."</TE>
<TE>   Dispenza said the council may consider altering the ordinance so
that homeless campers would receive a ticket rather than a
misdemeanor citation.</TE>
<TE>   He also said the issue has convinced him that the city needs to
consider building a homeless shelter.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm as much of a bleeding heart as anybody else," he said. "We
have to take care of the people that really need and want it."</TE>

<HD>Singer Investigated in Assault Case</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Andrew Blankstein and Richard Winton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police are investigating allegations that singer Rick James, famous
for the 1981 hit "Super Freak," sexually assaulted a woman at his
Woodland Hills home.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday night, officials served a search warrant at the house
where the 26-year-old woman said James, 54, assaulted her last
weekend.</LD>
<LD>   "They are allegations of a sexual nature," said Robbery-Homicide
Capt. Jim Tatreau.</LD>
<TE>   "Rick James was cooperative with police," he said.</TE>
<TE>   James could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, he was convicted of assaulting two women.</TE>
<TE>   The first attack occurred two years earlier when he restrained and
burned a young woman with a hot pipe during a weeklong cocaine binge
at his house in West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   He was free on bail when the second assault occurred in 1992 in
James' room at the St. James Club &amp; Hotel in West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The jury hung on a torture charge that could have sent James to
prison for life.</TE>
<TE>   He was sentenced to more than two years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the singer released a new album, but a year later he
suffered a stroke that derailed a comeback tour.</TE>
<TE>   This year, he went on tour again, appearing in May at the Greek
Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a desire and a purpose now," he told The Times in May.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, I was really on drugs [when] I went on stage," he said.
"Now I can remember the cities I'm in and the songs I'm singing."</TE>

<HD>County Moves to Trim Legal Costs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daren Briscoe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to hire a "litigation cost
manager" in an effort to trim Los Angeles County's tab for lawyers'
fees, legal fees, judgments and settlements -- a bill that reached
$167 million last year.</LD>
<LD>   The vote comes after months of wrangling between the county
counsel's office, which handles claims and lawsuits against the
county and its departments, and the board, which approves some
settlements.</LD>
<LD>   With more than 500 employees and a $64-million budget, the county
counsel's office would be one of the largest law firms in the state
if it were a private operation.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike other county departments, it has a high degree of
independence, needing board approval only in cases involving
settlements of more than $100,000. It has sole authority to enter
into contracts with outside law firms.</TE>
<TE>   County supervisors, anticipating a total budget deficit of at
least $332 million over the next three years, have become
increasingly critical of the county counsel's handling of cases.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Gloria Molina said the counsel has done an inadequate
job of determining which cases to fight and which to settle.</TE>
<TE>   "They've gotten in a rut of doing things the same way all the
time," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In a lawsuit brought by the county police force involving
race-based pay discrimination, the county's exposure initially was
estimated at $500,000, according to Molina spokesman Miguel Santana.
The county counsel took the case to trial and spent nearly $500,000
in legal fees, only to be ordered in June to pay $60 million.
Officials are appealing that verdict.</TE>
<TE>   They also plan to appeal a judge's order that the county pay $12
million in damages after a private lawyer hired by the county in a
medical malpractice suit failed to show up for trial.</TE>
<TE>   When the board asked in August for an accounting of how the
department was spending money, it took more than six weeks for the
county counsel to produce a report.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors voted to hire someone with "extensive private sector
experience" to help manage legal costs.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Monday was a bright and sunny day in beautiful Los Angeles, where all
the children are good-looking and the bougainvillea is forever in
bloom.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday was sent from heaven as well, and the forecast for today
is more of the same -- perhaps a bit breezy, but otherwise
sunsational.</LD>
<LD>   I feel good enough to cry.</LD>
<TE>   Better yet, maybe I'll call the ex-mayor, Dick Riordan, and tell
him what a wonderful man he is. And then I can ask him for a job.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, you may recall, is itching to start his own newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "The Times has a death wish for Los Angeles," the ex-mayor
explained earlier this year, saying the city ought to have a
newspaper that wants its readers to fall in love with the place. The
Times "would like to see the city destroyed, and 99% of the local
news it prints is negative, and that hurts the city."</TE>
<TE>   To the extent that I'm guilty, I have but one thing to say:</TE>
<TE>   You gotta sin to get saved.</TE>
<TE>   I'm a new man, Dick. Put me to work on the Brentwood Bugle, or
whatever it's going to be called. Rescue me from my own dark urges,
not to mention this gang of negative nabobs I work with.</TE>
<TE>   Less than two weeks ago, I took my first step on the road to
salvation. When the doomsaying Times reported that billionaire Eli
Broad tried to purchase the portion of the L.A. school board he and
Riordan don't already own, did I criticize?</TE>
<TE>   Not on your life. I offered a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Mitchell, president of Occidental College, told his trustees
that Broad would write a $10-million check for an Occidental program
to train school principals if Mitchell ran for the city school board.
Broad and Riordan are gunning for trustee David Tokofsky, who refuses
to be their lackey.</TE>
<TE>   Broad denied there was any such deal. But just to let him know I'm
in play, I offered to run for school board for only $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Now my colleagues Peter Hong and Solomon Moore report that Riordan
offered Occidental a deal of his own. If Mitchell ran for the city
school board, Riordan would pony up the cash for a provost-type
position at the college.</TE>
<TE>   Did Mr. Riordan miss my first column on this subject?</TE>
<TE>   Come on, chief. I'm available, and I live in the district.</TE>
<TE>   Make it $7 million and I'll train principals, run for school board
and write for the Brentwood Bugle, penning sunny stories about the
selfless work of certain millionaires and billionaires. For $7
million, I'll shine your wingtips and chew your steak, and you and
Eli will still be up $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan has denied recruiting Mitchell to run for school board.
And, at the risk of lapsing into negativity, I think that means
someone is lying.</TE>
<TE>   Is it Mitchell? The Occidental trustees? Broad and Riordan?</TE>
<TE>   Or is it the smear squad at the L.A. Times?</TE>
<TE>   The old me would have had no doubt. And I would have suggested
that although Broad and Riordan have done a few good things for L.A.
and its schools, and spent millions of their own money, this is not
their kingdom and we are not their subjects.</TE>
<TE>   But the new me has this to say:</TE>
<TE>   Even if Broad and Riordan are lying -- and I'm not saying they are
-- you have to admire their chutzpah. They believe so strongly they
know better than us rubes what's in our best interest, they're
willing to trample democracy to have their way.</TE>
<TE>   God bless them.</TE>
<TE>   God bless the children.</TE>
<TE>   And God bless a city I can better serve writing columns dictated
by Riordan, if not Broad.</TE>
<TE>   I think I may have completely misunderstood Riordan until now.</TE>
<TE>   When he took a profit of $74 million in the 1980s through
leveraged buyouts and other deals that temporarily cost thousands of
people their jobs, I believe he was teaching them the value of
starting over. It must have been an epiphany that prompted him to say
he was "learning how to wave to the poor people."</TE>
<TE>   When Riordan called a weaselly in-house report on the LAPD's
Rampart police scandal the best "in the history of mankind," and then
admitted he hadn't finished reading it, I believe it was part of his
campaign to get the whole city reading more.</TE>
<TE>   I might have made a wisecrack or two about Riordan helping to buy
Church Chopper 1 for Cardinal Roger Mahony so His Eminence wouldn't
be stuck in traffic, or the annulment Riordan managed to finagle from
the church. And maybe I suggested that a rubber mallet might have
beaten Bill Simon in the Republican primary for governor, even though
Riordan couldn't.</TE>
<TE>   But that's because I was blinded by negativity.</TE>
<TE>   For $7 million, I'll see nothing but sunshine.</TE>

<LD>Competition for a multimillion-dollar security contract to police the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority's bus and train system heated
up Tuesday, as elected city and county officials pushed their
respective police agencies forward.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles City Council unanimously approved a Los Angeles
Police Department plan to bid on a security contract for county buses
and trains. Meantime, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department
received approval from the county Board of Supervisors to proceed
with its own contract offer.</LD>
<LD>   Policing of the MTA's rail and bus system is now split under a
contract costing the transit agency nearly $60 million. The LAPD
patrols buses in Los Angeles and the Red Line subway. The Sheriff's
Department patrols buses throughout the remainder of the county and
the Blue and Green Line railways.</LD>
<TE>   The five-year contracts for both police agencies expired Nov. 1.
The MTA has temporarily extended the contracts and asked the police
agencies to offer new bids by Friday that reflect the MTA's desire to
cut costs and change how it is policed. The transit agency wants more
say in officer deployment and wants a team of civilians to check
fares, a job now done by uniformed officers.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Dan Finkelstein, head of the sheriff's transit division,
said his department will offer a plan to take over the entire
security contract. That would send scores of deputies fanning across
Los Angeles for the first time on buses and trains. The plan would
create a transit force of about 340 deputies for nearly $50 million,
Finkelstein said.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council cleared the way for two LAPD bids. A $26-million
contract would deploy 166 officers providing security on buses
throughout central Los Angeles and on the Red Line. A more expansive
contract offer calls for the LAPD to put officers on buses in the
city, plus the Red Line and the Gold Line, which is expected to open
in July.</TE>

<HD>Death of Man, Woman Called Murder-Suicide</HD>
<DH>A retired FBI agent and his girlfriend are found dead in
San Juan Capistrano mobile home. An inquiry is underway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Haldane</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A retired FBI agent and his girlfriend died early Tuesday after the
man apparently shot her and then himself in the San Juan Capistrano
mobile home they shared, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   They were identified as Reneau Franklin Kinsey, 67, and Delores
Jayne Ulrich, 70, who investigators said had been living together for
eight years.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't know what happened" to cause the shooting, said Jim
Amormino, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<TE>   Neighbors in the mobile home park in the 32300 block of Alipaz
Street called police about 6:15 a.m. after hearing three shots coming
from the couple's unit.</TE>
<TE>   When officers arrived, Amormino said, they found both dead in the
bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   "He apparently shot her twice with a handgun, then shot himself
with a shotgun," Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   Though neighbors told investigators that the couple had been
having problems lately and that Ulrich was planning to leave Kinsey,
Amormino said the motive is under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never responded to domestic violence calls there in the
past," he said. "People [in the park] are totally devastated by this
tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   According to Amormino, neighbors described Ulrich as a popular
gardener and artist who had painted murals inside the mobile home
park's clubhouse and spa area.</TE>
<TE>   Kinsey, he said, retired from the Riverside office of the FBI in
1988 and, more recently, may have worked as a private investigator.</TE>
<TE>   "We think they were his private weapons," Amormino said of the
firearms used in the shootings. "These stories are always sad,
especially around the holidays."</TE>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>SAN DIEGO -- Superior Court Judge Bonnie Dumanis was declared the
victor Tuesday in her fight to unseat Dist. Atty. Paul Pfingst after
one of the closest and nastiest election battles in county history.</LD>
<LD>   After absentee and provisional ballots were counted, Dumanis had
50.3% of the vote to Pfingst's 49.6%.</LD>
<LD>   Dumanis becomes the first female district attorney in county
history and, according to a national gay political action committee,
the first openly gay district attorney in the nation.</LD>
<TE>   Dumanis, 50, served as a deputy district attorney for 12 years
before being appointed a Juvenile Court referee in 1990 and then
elected twice to the Superior Court bench. Pfingst, 51, a homicide
prosecutor before going into private practice, was elected district
attorney in 1994, defeating a six-term incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   Pfingst's bid for a third term was undercut by a vote of no
confidence by the deputy district attorneys association, controversy
over his handling of two murder cases, and a last-minute accusation
by one of his deputies that he had made anti-Semitic comments 17
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Pfingst fought back with accusations that Dumanis was a lackluster
prosecutor and doesn't have the management skills to run a large
organization.</TE>
<TE>   "The people have heard our message, and our message is that it's
time for a change," Dumanis said at a press conference at the
headquarters of the San Diego Police Officers Assn., which had
endorsed her.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Ron Roberts and City Councilman George Stevens,
both veterans of decades of San Diego political fights, called the
race one of the "dirtiest campaigns" they had ever witnessed.</TE>
<TE>   Dumanis' campaign was helped by fund-raising done by local and
national gay organizations. Her largest margins were in the Hillcrest
and North Park neighborhoods of San Diego, known as gay enclaves.</TE>
<TE>   Pfingst never mentioned Dumanis' sexual orientation, but a
Christian political group distributed fliers mentioning that she is a
lesbian, and former San Diego Mayor Roger Hedgecock, now host of a
local radio talk show, referred to her as a "suicidal lesbian."
Dumanis conceded that she had attempted suicide after her sister's
death.</TE>
<TE>   Dumanis won by 3,556 votes out of 581,166 cast.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Offers Comparison Data for Assessing Nursing Home
Quality</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mitchell Landsberg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The federal government began offering information to consumers
Tuesday that will help them evaluate the quality of 17,000 nursing
homes nationwide, and also provide a rough measure of how California
nursing homes stack up against their counterparts nationally.</LD>
<LD>   The information, including scores for nursing homes on 10 measures
of quality, is available through Medicare, both on its Internet site
and by telephone.</LD>
<LD>   Jo Ellen Ross, president and chief executive officer of California
Medical Review Inc., the nonprofit agency that is charged with
maintaining the integrity of Medicaid services in California, called
the release of the information "groundbreaking." Medicaid has long
collected the information but never before made it public, Ross said.</LD>
<TE>   "We as the public have far more information about buying
refrigerators than we do when we have to face putting one of our
family members in a nursing home," Ross said, "and this is really
going to help give some measures of quality that will help make those
decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Release of the data is part of an initiative that also involves
government-funded training for nursing home personnel. Her company
will conduct the training in California, Ross said.</TE>
<TE>   Though Ross praised the program, Patricia McGinnis of California
Advocates for Nursing Home Reform said she feared it was part of a
Bush administration plan to reduce government oversight, and would
not give every consumer more choice. Too often, McGinnis said,
options are severely limited by finances or the patient's condition.</TE>
<TE>   She also criticized the government for, in effect, subsidizing
for-profit nursing homes by providing tax-funded training.</TE>
<TE>   McGinnis said California consumers already have access to a wealth
of information about the state's 1,400 nursing homes through a Web
site produced by her organization and a newer one launched by the
California Health Care Foundation. However, she acknowledged that
some information in the federal database is not available elsewhere,
and is "wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   Chiefly, the database evaluates nursing homes by 10 criteria, and
compares each nursing home to the state and national averages. Those
averages also provide a look at how states compare with each other.</TE>
<TE>   The data show that California nursing homes, on average, have
slightly fewer residents who complain of pain and fewer with a loss
of abilities in basic daily tasks. However, the state fares worse
than the national average in the percentage of residents in physical
restraints.</TE>
<TE>   The information is available on the Internet at www. medicare.gov
(click on "Nursing Home Compare"). Those without Internet access can
call 800-MEDICARE (633-4227). The other Web sites that evaluate
California nursing homes are www.nursinghomeguide.org and
www.calnhs.org.</TE>

<LD>Two adults and a child escaped injury early Tuesday when flames
gutted their Coto de Caza home, causing about $400,000 in damage,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The fire began in the garage of the home at 16 Eastridge and
quickly spread to the roof, said Capt. Steve Miller of the Orange
County Fire Authority.</LD>
<LD>   Firefighters saved one of the family's cats, but another died, and
a third is missing.</LD>
<TE>   It took 45 firefighters 30 minutes to control the blaze, which
authorities said was caused by oil-soaked rags igniting in the
garage.</TE>

<HD>You Just Never Know When a Travel Journal Might Trip Up
Your Accusers</HD>

<LD>No murder, they wrote? The latest issue of Westways magazine offers
several travel tips, including a Carlsbad resident's suggestion to
keep a journal.</LD>
<LD>   "In addition to providing a nice record of each trip, this kind of
journal can be a protection," she said. "I read about a traveling
couple who were arrested for murder; the log they'd kept of their
trip helped to clear them."</LD>
<LD>   And that's not all. Even if you beat the murder rap, the journal
might also come in handy if you're slapped with a tax evasion charge.</LD>
<TE>   Back on land: Ronald Black of La Crescenta noticed a sign with a
couple of letters unlighted, giving the impression that "auto parts
were available for the temper-challenged drivers who frequent our
byways" (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   I wonder if I should start keeping a journal on the freeway, too.</TE>
<TE>   Some nerve: A reader sent along the instructions in a software
offer from AOL that raises this question: Is there no limit to how
brazenly these communications giants will treat their customers? (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   I'm surprised that AOL's lawyers didn't take note of the fact
that, with all that high-voltage juice running through the monitor,
applying one's tongue could be dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Assaults on the English language: Flo Selfman shared a notice that
a niece received for what sounded like quite a highfalutin position
(see accompanying). Translation: salesclerk.</TE>
<TE>   May I recommend the deconstructionism tonight? Joe Morgenstern,
the Wall Street Journal's witty movie critic, wrote that he was
discussing a documentary about French philosopher Jacques Derrida in
a Santa Monica restaurant when the waitress broke in.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a movie about Jacques Derrida?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Morgenstern told her, and asked how she knew the name.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a philosopher!" she explained.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm working on my doctorate at UCLA."</TE>
<TE>   Luckily for the folks at Morgenstern's table, she was not a
brooding philosopher; he reported that she was attentive and
pleasant.</TE>
<TE>   Like everyone else in Southern California, I've encountered plenty
of waiters who are really actors. I wouldn't mind this trend, except
it seems I'm always running into actors who seem to be playing the
part of bad waiters.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Bruce Rothschild noticed that an ad for the Bolshoi
Ballet's performances at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in
Costa Mesa said: "Due to improvements on the 405 and 55 freeways,
patrons are encouraged to allow additional time or use alternative
routes when traveling to this area ..."</TE>
<TE>   Commented Rothschild: "What would it be like if they were not
improved?!"</TE>

<HD>Bid Launched to Bring Back Open Primary</HD>
<DH>Business groups say such elections would encourage moderate
candidates. Previous system was rejected by U.S. Supreme Court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Morain</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Dismayed by low turnout and fearing increased partisanship among
legislators, major business interests are planning an initiative
campaign to create a new open primary system aimed at helping
moderates win office.</LD>
<LD>   The concept would make partisan races for governor and other
statewide offices, along with races for the Legislature and Congress,
more like campaigns for the state superintendent of public
instruction or municipal elections, which are nonpartisan.</LD>
<LD>   California Chamber of Commerce President Allan Zaremberg and Bill
Hauck, head of the Business Roundtable, said Tuesday that under their
proposal, aimed for the 2004 ballot, candidates would list their
party affiliation in primary elections. But voters, regardless of
their party, would receive a single primary ballot and vote for the
candidate of their choice. The two candidates with the most votes
would face each other in the general election.</LD>
<TE>   The proposal comes after an election in which roughly half of
registered voters cast ballots, and two years after the U.S. Supreme
Court struck down California's previous open primary law.</TE>
<TE>   Backers of the proposal include proponents of the 1996 version,
known as a blanket primary. Zaremberg and Hauck said the business
groups are sending the proposal to constitutional experts to
determine whether it would withstand legal challenges, and airing it
before focus groups.</TE>
<TE>   In most instances, the top two vote-getters would be a Democrat
and a Republican. But in some legislative and congressional districts
that are heavily Republican or Democratic, candidates receiving the
most primary votes -- and squaring off in the general election --
could come from the same party.</TE>
<TE>   Hauck said he believes the proposal could help moderates win
legislative seats.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't let this state get to the point where it is governed by
ideologues on either end of the spectrum," Hauck said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 60% of the voters in 1996 approved the open primary, and
turnout increased in the March 1998 primary under the new system.</TE>
<TE>   But acting on a lawsuit brought by political parties, the Supreme
Court struck down the system, ruling that political party members,
and not voters at large, had a constitutional right to pick
candidates of their choice.</TE>
<TE>   Political parties are sure to oppose the latest version.
California Republican Party spokesman Rob Stutzman said there is
"little enthusiasm among party leaders for an open primary." State
Democratic Party executive Bob Mulholland called the proposal a
"Trojan horse."</TE>
<TE>   "They want to repeal all the progressive rules, such as the
eight-hour workday, such as environmental protections," Mulholland
said. "They want to take over the Legislature on behalf of the big
corporate interests."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would give voters who decline to state their party
affiliation broader rights to vote in primaries. But Mulholland said
the proposal could disenfranchise supporters of third-party
candidates by denying those candidates a place on general election
ballots, unless the candidates should happen to be among the top two
vote-getters.</TE>
<TE>   Because most districts are dominated by either Democrats or
Republicans, there were only a handful of competitive races in this
month's election. Most races were effectively decided in the March
primary, when most voters were party loyalists who generally vote for
either the most conservative or the most liberal candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "This Legislature," Hauck added, "is increasingly going to go left
and right. It is out of balance. That is not good for anybody in
California. The decision making represents the point of view of a
very small number of people. What we're trying to achieve here is a
Legislature that reflects the views of all Californians."</TE>
<TE>   Proponents expect to raise $2 million to gather signatures for
what would be a constitutional amendment. They don't need to turn in
signatures to place such a measure on the November 2004 ballot until
2004.</TE>

<LD>Every so often, I edge closer to the death-penalty camp. A
particularly hideous crime occurs and the part of me that wants
vengeance cries out.</LD>
<LD>   Then something happens as it did last week in Sacramento -- when
the fallacies and hypocrisies of the death-penalty argument leap
forth -- and I scamper back to the 30% minority opposed to capital
punishment.</LD>
<LD>   The news was that four middle-aged former soldiers of the
Symbionese Liberation Army pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for
the 1975 shotgun killing of Myrna Opsahl, a wife and mother of four.
Emily Montague, known then as Emily Harris, admitted to having pulled
the trigger, although she said it went off accidentally. It's worth
noting that for years she denied even shooting.</LD>
<TE>   The four were revolutionaries dedicated to the violent overthrow
of the U.S. government. The Opsahl murder occurred during a bank
robbery. A year before, the SLA had kidnapped Patty Hearst.</TE>
<TE>   Quite a crew, huh? With her dossier -- revolutionary, kidnapper,
bank robber, killer -- do you have any doubt what punishment U.S.
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft or any state attorney general would be
arguing for Montague had the crime occurred last week?</TE>
<TE>   There's the rub. The murder occurred a quarter-century ago, giving
them time to redirect their lives. By all accounts, the four former
revolutionaries (a fifth was arrested last week in South Africa)
built productive, law-abiding lives.</TE>
<TE>   In legal terms, it may have been hard to convict in so old a case,
but that isn't the point. The point is, Montague admitted to having
pulled the trigger in a situation that, under our prevailing opinions
of people who do such things, would have won her an execution date.</TE>
<TE>   She would have been deemed unfit to live in civil society. Had she
been executed, we would never have known the truth. The truth, which
we now can verify, is that she became the opposite.</TE>
<TE>   Montague, now 55, faces eight years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no reason to pursue any lengthier prison time," said
Mrs. Opsahl's son, Jon, who had kept his mother's memory and the case
alive over the years. Mrs. Opsahl's husband, 76, said he had "no hard
feelings" for the former SLA members.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the problems with the death penalty is precisely this,"
says Denise Gragg, an Orange County public defender. "Most people
engaged in that kind of behavior age out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Most killers are men under 30 who often change, Gragg says.
"That's why it's so tragic that we execute people 15 to 20 years down
the road, because we almost always are executing someone different
than the one who committed the crime."</TE>
<TE>   In Emily Montague's case, the shotgun slayer became a computer
consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Eight years in prison for a murder is hardly excessive, not even
27 years after the fact. I am arguing that a system that would have
declared her a throwaway a generation ago now eats those words.</TE>
<TE>   So, life goes on. For some. Last week, as the SLA members copped
their pleas, the U.S. Supreme Court restored the execution order for
a man convicted of a 1982 robbery and murder in Orange County. The
court said John Visciotti should die for his crime, committed when he
was about 25, a bit younger than Montague was.</TE>
<TE>   Different case, different details.</TE>
<TE>   Just curious -- does a killer's heart still tick in Visciotti?</TE>

<HD>Heinz von Foerster, 90; Physicist Who Gave Date for End of

<DL></DL>
<LD>Heinz von Foerster, 90, a physicist, philosopher and eclectic
researcher who once predicted the date for doomsday, died Oct. 2 of
unspecified causes at his home in Pescadero, Calif.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Vienna, Von Foerster studied physics there and got his
doctorate at the University of Breslau. By hiding his Jewish
ancestry, he was able to work in Berlin radar labs during World War
II. Von Foerster moved to the United States in 1949 to head the
Electron Tube Laboratory at the University of Illinois, and a decade
later founded its Biological Computer Laboratory.</LD>
<LD>   He also edited presentations from the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation
Conferences in New York; it was material from various scientists that
became the basis for future research ranging from biological physics
to computer science. His research touched biophysics, mathematical
biology, computational technology, cognition and epistemology.</LD>
<TE>   In 1960, Von Foerster co-wrote a provocative study about
burgeoning overpopulation in which he used a mathematical formula to
calculate that doomsday would occur Nov. 13, 2026.</TE>
<TE>   By that date, if birthrates could not be curbed, he said, world
population would reach infinity. "Our great-great-grandchildren will
not starve to death," he said in an article published in The Times.
"They will be squeezed to death."</TE>

<LD>   Bader shared a daytime Emmy last year for the animated "Batman
Beyond" and was nominated for several other Emmys for her work on
that program and on "The New Batman/Superman Adventures."</LD>
<LD>   A versatile entertainer, the Brooklyn-born Bader studied mime in
Paris and, with partner Edmund Felix, wrote and toured the United
States performing story theater they titled "African Folk Tales."
Bader moved to Hollywood to write for television, pitched a couple of
scripts to "Star Trek" and got hired as a Writers Guild intern.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to writing for that series, "Lois &amp; Clark: The New
Adventures of Superman," "Xena: Warrior Princess" and animated
adventure series, Bader also wrote 38 comic books for DC Comics and
several Web episodes of "Gotham Girls" and "Red Knuckles Gym."</TE>

<HD>Ross Wilson, 83; Red Wings Hockey Trainer, Emergency Goalie</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ross "Lefty" Wilson, 83, a longtime trainer for the Detroit Red Wings
hockey team who played in three National Hockey League games as an
emergency goalie, died Nov. 5 in Naples, Fla., of complications from
heart and lung failure.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Toronto, Wilson joined the Red Wings as an assistant
trainer in 1950. In those days, the National Hockey League was far
less sophisticated than it is today.</LD>
<LD>   One of the more curious rules concerned the replacement of an
injured goalie. When the goalie for either team went down and was
unable to continue, the home team was required to supply a
replacement. Those replacements were usually amateur goalies, and
Wilson, who had played minor league hockey, fit that bill.</LD>
<TE>   Wilson made his NHL debut for the Red Wings against the Montreal
Canadiens in Montreal after goalie Terry Sawchuk was slashed with an
opponent's skates. The Canadiens won 4-1, but Wilson did not allow a
goal for 16 minutes and made a couple of impressive saves.</TE>
<TE>   In 1957, he played for the Boston Bruins against his own team,
playing 52 minutes and allowing one goal. The game ended in a 2-2
tie.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, Wilson designed a mask for goalies, which he sold
around the league for $35 apiece. Wilson retired in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a throwback," Bruce Martyn, a former Red Wings
broadcaster, once told the Detroit News. "He was supposed to take
care of people, but he'd say: 'Get up, get up. You're not hurt.' "</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>John P. Meehan Jr., 79, retired USC professor of physiology who
studied the effects of weightlessness and acceleration for NASA, died
Oct. 23 in Los Angeles of leukemia.</LD>
<LD>   Born in San Francisco and reared in San Marino, Meehan earned his
bachelor's degree from Caltech and his medical degree from USC.
During the Korean War, he served as an Air Force colonel heading the
Arctic Aeromedical Laboratory at Ladd Air Force Base in Fairbanks,
Alaska.</LD>
<LD>   As a physician, Meehan delivered two of his own children while
stationed at the remote base. During World War II, he conducted
research for the military leading to the development of pressure
suits for fighter pilots at high altitudes.</LD>
<TE>   Meehan joined the USC faculty in 1947, and served as chairman of
its physiology department from 1966 until his retirement in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   He was associated with NASA for several decades, and with a
centrifuge he helped design and construct the original astronauts'
space suits. A master machinist, he also designed and built their
monitoring devices, which continually apprised mission control of
their heart rates and blood pressure.</TE>
<TE>   In one of his studies to determine problems with weightlessness in
1964, called Operation Sacktime, he put 14 USC students in bed for 30
days and devised exercises for them to prevent dizziness on rising.
The experiment simulated astronauts' anti-gravity suspension status
during space flight.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, Meehan helped Los Angeles County acquire a
hyperbaric chamber to treat divers suffering air embolisms or
decompression sickness known as the bends. USC operates the chamber
at the Marine Science Center on Catalina Island.</TE>

<LD>Ken Raffensberger, 85, a pitcher who twice led the National League in
shutouts during a 15-year career in the major leagues, died Sunday in
York, Pa. The cause of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   A native of York, Raffensberger made his major league debut with
the St. Louis Cardinals in 1939. He saw his first significant action
the next season with the Chicago Cubs -- pitching in 43 games, mostly
as a reliever -- posting a 7-9 record.</LD>
<LD>   In 1944, the left-hander was the winning pitcher in the All Star
Game. It was one of the few bright spots for Raffensberger that year
as he led with 20 losses while playing for Philadelphia.</LD>
<TE>   Raffensberger had his best seasons after he was traded to the
Cincinnati Reds in 1947. He led the league in shutouts in 1949 with
five and recorded an 18-17 record. In 1952, he was 17-13 with a 2.81
earned run average and led the league with six shutouts.</TE>

<HD>Margaret 'Peg' Phillips, 84; TV Actress</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Margaret "Peg" Phillips, who realized her dream of becoming an
actress only in her late 60s and gained national recognition as
general-store owner Ruth-Anne Miller on the CBS television series
"Northern Exposure" from 1990 to 1995, has died. She was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Phillips, a lifelong smoker, died Thursday of pulmonary disease in
a suburban Seattle care center.</LD>
<LD>   "I smoke, I eat lots of fat and red meat and don't exercise if I
don't have to. This is the best time of life if you have your health,
and I do," she told news media in Los Angeles in 1993 at a conference
to introduce the fall television shows. Her priority, she added, was
"living to be 90 ... 113, would you believe?"</LD>
<TE>   But in 1995, she suffered a ruptured aorta and, in 1999, a broken
hip and wrist when she was hit by a car. Earlier, as a Navy wife in
1941, she lived through the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and, in the
1950s, she conquered polio and peritonitis.</TE>
<TE>   However belated, success as an actress was sweet for Phillips, who
used much of her newfound wealth to create the Theatre Inside to
assist troubled youths at Echo Glen juvenile correctional facility
near Snoqualmie, Wash., and to start the Woodinville Repertory
Theatre in her Seattle suburb.</TE>
<TE>   "I never wanted to do anything but act," the native of Everett,
Wash., told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer in 1993. "I wanted to go
to the University of Washington Drama School ... but when I got out
of high school, there was no money. It was 1935."</TE>
<TE>   Confronted with the economic reality of the Depression, she moved
to California, worked as a bookkeeper and accountant, married and
divorced twice and reared four children mostly as a single mother.</TE>
<TE>   Over nearly 50 years, Phillips spent her spare moments acting in
community theaters wherever she was. But only at her retirement in
the early 1980s did she return to Seattle and enroll at age 67 at the
University of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Realizing she might not last to age 113, she acquired an agent in
her freshman year. She soon had so much work -- radio and television
commercials and bit parts in eight movies including "Waiting for the
Light" starring Shirley MacLaine -- that she never had time to finish
her degree.</TE>
<TE>   But Phillips, herself something of a character with character,
found her signature role in 1990, when she was cast as the
tart-tongued but kindly Miller in "Northern Exposure," a series
starring Rob Morrow as a New Yorker working off his medical school
expenses in Cicely, Alaska. The series was shot in rural Washington
state not far from Phillips' 100-year-old farmhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "I almost didn't audition for the series because ... I don't go
out on little cookie jar grandmother things," she said in 1992. "I
don't have gray hair, I'm skinny and move too fast. I guess casting
directors would see me more as a bag lady."</TE>
<TE>   Peg and Ruth-Anne were a match -- dark-haired, sprightly and
usually dressed in something casual like overalls. Phillips even wore
bluejeans, a red and white checked blouse, suspenders and sandals to
the Emmy Awards ceremony in 1993, when she was nominated for best
supporting actress.</TE>
<TE>   Envisioned as a minor recurring role, Ruth-Anne proved so popular
that after 16 episodes she became a regular, wisely and calmly
solving the whole fictional town's problems.</TE>
<TE>   The actress considered her favorite "Northern Exposure" episode
the one in which the shopkeeper's young Native American friend, Ed
Chigliak, gave her a wilderness-area grave site for her birthday and
the two danced on the site. "That was the most beautiful script I've
ever been asked to perform," the actress told the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips is survived by two daughters; eight grandchildren and one
great-grandchild.</TE>
<TE>   Services are planned for Saturday in Bellevue, Wash. The family
has asked that memorial contributions be sent to the Woodinville
Repertory Theatre, P.O. Box 2003, Woodinville, WA 98072.</TE>

<HD>4.2 Quake Rattles Parkfield</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A magnitude 4.2 earthquake struck Tuesday along the San Andreas fault
in an area seven miles northwest of Parkfield in Central California
where scientists have long forecast a strong quake in the magnitude 6
range.</LD>
<LD>   The 8:48 a.m. temblor caused no damage or injuries. It occurred at
a depth of five miles, the U.S. Geological Survey reported, and was
very close to instruments drilled deep into the Earth in an
experiment begun earlier this year to study the quake process.</LD>
<LD>   Seismologist John Langbein, a supervisor of the work at Parkfield,
said Tuesday's quake slightly elevates the chance of a larger
earthquake, predicted since 1985, occurring in the next few days. But
he said there was only about a 1% possibility.</LD>
<TE>   Parkfield is about midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Unveils Plan to Bring City Services Closer to
Residents</HD>
<DH>Mayor says the 10 ideas are designed to counter
frustrations that helped fuel secession drives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Shuster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn announced a package of proposals
Tuesday aimed at bringing city services closer to residents.</LD>
<LD>   The 10-point plan, which could take years to fully implement, is
intended to shorten the distance between City Hall and seven major
areas of the city, the mayor said. His proposals would ease access to
a broad array of such basic services as building permits, sidewalk
and street repairs, trash pickup and graffiti cleanup.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn, who helped defeat secession efforts in the San Fernando
Valley and Hollywood, used that campaign to talk about making city
government more efficient. He launched several initiatives -- a
pothole repair program, traffic officers at critical intersections,
among others -- during that time aimed at proving that City Hall
could be responsive to residents' needs, particularly in the Valley.</LD>
<TE>   Aides said he listened closely as residents throughout the city
complained over the last year about the inaccessibility of City Hall.
The mayor addressed that issue head-on Tuesday in an afternoon news
conference in Van Nuys, in front of the Marvin Braude Constituent
Service Center, a $34-million city building under construction.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said the secession movements sent a clear message that
residents want City Hall to change. "People care about services,"
Hahn said. "They want better services, they want more services. We
don't think you should have to take a graduate course to try to
understand how city government works."</TE>
<TE>   Facets of the new program, dubbed "TeamWork LA," include:</TE>
<TE>   * Creating "neighborhood service councils" composed of
representatives from city departments that receive the most requests
for services. The staffs would coordinate services in the North and
South Valley, West Los Angeles, Central Los Angeles, East Los
Angeles, South Los Angeles and the harbor.</TE>
<TE>   * Establishing neighborhood "city halls," such as the Braude
Center, in those areas so residents can take care of most
city-related business closer to home. These would be staffed by
"neighborhood specialists" who would help residents obtain services.</TE>
<TE>   * Beginning a computerized tracking system, called L.A. Stat and
based on the police model for tracking crime, to determine the level
of services provided throughout the city and to enable officials to
improve services where needed.</TE>
<TE>   * Directing the city's existing neighborhood councils to develop
plans to help city departments determine priorities for those areas.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn created the plan with the aid of a consultant who headed
former Vice President Al Gore's "reinventing government" project. It
contains proposals similar to several made by Councilman Tom LaBonge,
who was among the City Council members on hand Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge said he is pleased that the mayor took the lead in
improving city government: "We're empowering the city to do more."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn did not specify what the program would cost, beyond noting
that he will keep costs low by staffing the program with current
employees and using existing city offices. The city budgeted and
spent $170,000 on the L.A. Stat system.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said he wants to let neighborhoods tell City Hall how to
function better. "No neighborhood should feel neglected," Hahn said.
"Neighborhoods should drive the priorities of city government."</TE>
<TE>   City Council members Janice Hahn, Wendy Greuel and Dennis Zine
praised the program and said it will go a long way toward addressing
constituents' concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel indicated that it is only a first step and more needs to be
done. She said a system of boroughs that she and others offered
during the secession campaign as an alternative to separation is also
intended, like the mayor's plan, to bring city services closer to
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, everything's on the table," Greuel said. "But this is a
recognition by the mayor and the council and our departments that we
do need to change."</TE>

<HD>Toxicologist Guilty of Killing Husband</HD>
<DH>Kristin Rossum, 26, faces a possible life sentence in the
fatal poisoning of Gregory de Villers.</DH>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>After eight hours of deliberation, a jury Tuesday convicted a former
county toxicologist of murdering her husband with an overdose of a
powerful painkiller allegedly stolen from her job at the county
medical examiner's office.</LD>
<LD>   Kristin Rossum, 26, burst into tears, shook her head, and looked
imploringly at her parents as Superior Court Judge John Thompson
announced the verdict. The seven-man, five-woman jury also found
Rossum guilty of murder by "special circumstances," in this case, by
using poison.</LD>
<LD>   She looked at the jurors, but none returned her gaze.</LD>
<TE>   Rossum faces a possible life sentence without the possibility of
parole when she is sentenced Dec. 12. Prosecutors had opted not to
seek the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson imposed a gag order on attorneys, witnesses and family
members until after sentencing. Jurors fled the courthouse without
talking to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors alleged that Rossum killed her husband of 17 months
because he threatened to tell her boss that she was using drugs and
having an affair with a co-worker, Michael Robertson, the county's
former chief toxicologist.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson, now living in Australia, was listed as an unindicted
co-conspirator by the grand jury that charged Rossum with murdering
Gregory de Villers, a biotech industry worker, who would have been 29
years old Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said that Rossum, who graduated summa cum laude from
San Diego State University with a degree in biochemistry, used her
knowledge of drugs and chemistry to kill her husband and that she
hoped she could convince her colleagues at the medical examiner's
office that the death was a suicide. The medical examiner determines
cause of death in unusual cases.</TE>
<TE>   A large amount of the drug fentanyl was later discovered missing
from the county office; Robertson, who was fired after admitting that
he knew Rossum used methamphetamine, is an expert on fentanyl.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan Goldstein alleged that Rossum arranged the
couple's bedroom to look like her husband had committed suicide. His
body was found lying on their bed, a wedding photo and her crumpled
diary nearby, and rose petals scattered around the room.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors theorized that Rossum was re-creating a scene from her
favorite movie, "American Beauty," which includes a fantasy sequence
depicting a young woman being showered in rose petals.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most damaging pieces of evidence was a receipt showing
that Rossum had purchased a rose on the day her husband died. Rossum
had alleged the rose petals in the bedroom were 2 weeks old.</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein, in a withering cross-examination of the tearful Rossum,
called her explanation "bizarre" and forced her to concede that she
had lied in the past about her drug use and other matters. He called
fentanyl "the perfect poison" because it is difficult to detect.</TE>
<TE>   Rossum's parents had mortgaged their home to raise enough money so
she could be freed on $1.25-million bail during the trial. Her
father, Ralph Rossum, is a government professor at Claremont McKenna
College, and her mother, Constance Rossum, is an associate professor
of marketing and management at Azusa Pacific University.</TE>
<TE>   After bailing out their daughter, the Rossums said they lacked
money to hire a private attorney. A judge ruled that Rossum was
entitled to a public defender.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the verdict was announced, bailiffs had handcuffed
Rossum. Weeping and barely able to walk, she was led out of the
courtroom and taken to jail.</TE>
<TE>   De Villers' family watched the verdict without emotion. The family
is suing the county, alleging negligence for allowing Rossum to steal
a fatal dose of drugs from the medical examiner's office without
being caught. De Villers' father is a prominent plastic surgeon and
liposuction specialist.</TE>
<TE>   Although prosecutors never detailed how Rossum poisoned her
husband, there were indications that she may have applied patches
containing fentanyl to his arm while he slept. Fentanyl is a rarely
applied drug, and the medical examiner's office seldom tests for it,
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   But traces of fentanyl were found in De Villers' body by
examiners.</TE>
<TE>   De Villers' family was immediately suspicious of Rossum and told
police the night his body was found, Nov. 6, 2000, that they did not
believe he committed suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Rossum testified that her husband was groggy that night but that
she felt he was only showing the effects of a cold medication.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he was just sleeping it off," she testified. "I've
wished every day I'd called someone."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors showed that during the hours before her husband died,
Rossum made repeated calls to her lover, Robertson. Fentanyl, often
given to terminally ill cancer patients, is 80 times more powerful
than morphine.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors deliberated over parts of three days. By comparison, the
San Diego jury that convicted David Westerfield on Aug. 21 of
murdering Danielle van Dam, 7, deliberated over nine days.</TE>

<HD>A Downside to Weekend Downpour</HD>
<DH>The season's first big rainstorm leaves debris and higher
ocean pollution levels at Southland coasts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Reyes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first big rainstorm of the season left Southern California with
crystal-clear skies and fresh-washed streets. But along the coast,
dirty runoff from the storm left some beaches littered with debris
and caused ocean pollution levels to spike.</LD>
<LD>   "Everything that goes onto the streets is going to end up in the
ocean eventually," said Eric Edwards, an environmental health
specialist with Los Angeles County Health Department.</LD>
<LD>   Edwards said that along the Los Angeles County coast, weekend
water pollution levels were the highest in a year and that it could
take several more days before they decrease.</LD>
<TE>   "We expect the bacteria levels to remain high through Wednesday,
and we're hoping things will get back to normal by the end of the
week," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, bacteria readings in ocean water tests performed
over the weekend were so high that they exceeded the testing range of
16,000 organisms per 100 milliliters of water.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going off scale," said Larry Honeybourne of the Orange
County Health Care Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Bacteria levels normally run high after a storm. But because of
the lack of rain in the Southland, there has been no natural flushing
of such pollutants as engine oil and exhaust particles that have
settled on city streets. Other pollutants flowing to the ocean
include fertilizers and animal waste.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the pollution, most beaches remained open -- and offshore
winds brought out surfers.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura, balmy weather and 4-foot swells from the storm's
remnants beckoned veteran surfer Roger Rothwell to hit the waves. But
after a while in the water, Rothwell complained about burning eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so uncomfortable out there. You can't shake it," said
Rothwell, who was among a group of 30 surfers at the beach who
complained of eye irritations.</TE>
<TE>   Even though no beaches were closed, officials did issue warnings
to swimmers at more than three dozen Southern California beaches,
said Chad Nelsen, environmental director for the Surfrider
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The advisories suggest that swimmers avoid the ocean for at least
72 hours after a storm.</TE>
<TE>   "We would prefer that people not really swim when there are
advisories because they're swimming in water mixed with fertilizer
and animal waste and everything else that is in the water," said
Orange County's Honeybourne.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, lifeguards and beach operations were attacking another
byproduct of the storm: the tons of trash that was swept off streets,
down gutters and into the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   "The beach is just covered with debris," said Pete Driscoll, a
Seal Beach lifeguard. "I took a walk down there at the water's edge,
and you can see everything from plants to plastic bottles to
Styrofoam cups -- even shoes."</TE>
<TE>   Seal Beach lies downstream of the San Gabriel River, which begins
at the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and snakes its way
through dozens of cities in Los Angeles County before reaching the
ocean at Seal Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at that river," Driscoll said, "you can see the trash
from millions of people floating on down from all the cities inland.
It's just a lot of cities that that river goes through and it all
ends up here."</TE>

<HD>Trustees Seek Probe of Lopez Recall Effort</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Yi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Ana school trustees voted 3 to 1 on Tuesday to ask state
lawmakers and the attorney general to investigate allegations of
wrongdoing by organizers of a campaign to recall board member Nativo
V. Lopez.</LD>
<LD>   Recall supporters gathered enough signatures earlier this year to
force a special election, scheduled for Feb. 4. Lopez and his allies
have alleged, among other things, that signature-gatherers
misrepresented the petition's purpose and were not registered voters
in the Santa Ana Unified School District.</LD>
<LD>   In Tuesday's heated debate over the board action, Trustee
Rosemarie Avila, who cast the sole dissenting vote, called the
decision "outrageous."</LD>
<TE>   "This is an indication of the lack of respect [that] board members
Nativo Lopez and John Palacio have for the people of Santa Ana," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Trustee Sal Tinajero -- who voted with Lopez and Palacio
-- said that the decision would not cost the district any money and
that the probe was necessary to settle allegations of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Recall supporters say the signatures were gathered legally. The
district attorney's office, responding to complaints from the
district, said last month that an investigation found no evidence of
illegal conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez's critics accuse him of promoting bilingual education in
violation of Proposition 227 in the mostly Latino district of 62,000
students, as well as being a divisive force in the community. Lopez
denies doing anything illegal and says he is being targeted for
defending the rights of Latino students and their working-class
families.</TE>

<HD>Security Screening Now a Federal Case at Oxnard Airport</HD>
<DH>As part of a nationwide program, 11 trained government
workers have begun inspecting about 200 travelers a day at the small
field.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandra Murillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With little fanfare, Oxnard Airport welcomed a changing of the guard
Tuesday, as federal workers trained in the wake of Sept. 11 began
screening departing passengers.</LD>
<LD>   The change, which had little effect on passengers boarding a
Skywest Airlines flight to Los Angeles International Airport, is part
of a federal overhaul of airport security that airports began phasing
in earlier this year.</LD>
<LD>   Most passengers had no idea the change had taken place Tuesday,
but they welcomed the new security measures.</LD>
<TE>   "Having somebody who's been trained specifically for this job is
inherently better," said Jim Koss, an engineer en route to
Washington, D.C. "I'm sure the [airline] workers did their best, but
I'm not confident they had the necessary training and experience."</TE>
<TE>   Screeners must complete 40 hours of classroom instruction and 60
hours of on-the-job training.</TE>
<TE>   The changes, mandated by a law passed by Congress after the
terrorist attacks, require the federal government to hire and train
thousands of screeners for the nation's 429 commercial airports by
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   LAX completed phasing in its 1,600 federal screeners earlier this
month. They will be joined by an additional 1,600 federal workers who
will operate new bomb detection equipment in airport terminals by the
end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   At tiny Oxnard Airport, 11 federal screeners will check about 200
passengers who board six Skywest flights a day.</TE>
<TE>   Although the 216-acre airport appears to be an unlikely site for
terrorists, officials say the nation's smallest airports could be
vulnerable to people trying to circumvent security systems at larger
airports.</TE>
<TE>   "Where did Mohamed Atta start out that morning?" asked Jeff Spach,
a spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration, referring
to one of the Sept. 11 hijackers, who went through a checkpoint at a
small airport in Portland, Maine, before boarding another plane at
Logan International Airport in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "The very first thing we did in training was show them that video
of him walking through security," Spach said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a smaller airport than LAX, but their job is just as
important."</TE>
<TE>   Passenger Lisa Krause of Chicago said it couldn't hurt to make
sure the smaller airports are properly staffed.</TE>
<TE>   "People are less likely to slip through the cracks this way," said
Krause, a customer service representative with United Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a smaller airport, and this way they're more likely to catch
something unusual."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to hire a "litigation cost
manager" in an effort to trim Los Angeles County's tab for lawyers'
fees, legal fees, judgments and settlements -- a bill that reached
$167 million last year.</LD>
<LD>   The vote comes after months of wrangling between the county
counsel's office, which handles claims and lawsuits against the
county, and the board, which approves some settlements.</LD>
<LD>   County supervisors, anticipating a total budget deficit of at
least $332 million over the next three years, have become
increasingly critical of the county counsel's handling of cases.</LD>

<HD>No Links Found to O.C. Man in Utah Kidnap</HD>
<DH>Salt Lake City police say they were swayed by the sex
offender's alibi and by evidence from his car. Probe continues into
the girl's June abduction.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Utah police Tuesday said they no longer consider an Orange County man
a suspect in the highly publicized June kidnapping of Salt Lake City
girl Elizabeth Smart.</LD>
<LD>   Salt Lake City police began looking at James Witbaard in August
after learning that the convicted sex offender had visited Utah last
summer and had family in Provo, less than an hour's drive from the
crime scene.</LD>
<LD>   Cooperating with Orange County authorities, Utah investigators
analyzed evidence collected from Witbaard's car and found no link to
Smart, said Salt Lake City Police Capt. Cory Lyman, commander of a
task force investigating the girl's disappearance.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities also were swayed by Witbaard's alibi, Lyman said.
Orange County Deputy Public Defender Doug Lobato said he and Witbaard
visited the Sheriff's Department together the morning of the girl's
disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   "His alibi checks out, and the physical evidence doesn't tie him
[to the crime]," Lyman said.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement comes six weeks after Orange County Dist. Atty.
Tony Rackauckas suspended a veteran sex crimes prosecutor who
negotiated a plea bargain with Witbaard in July. It was not known
Tuesday whether the Utah decision on Witbaard would affect the
prosecutor's discipline.</TE>
<TE>   Smart, 14, was abducted from her home at gunpoint June 5. She has
not been found.</TE>
<TE>   O.C. probation officials arrested Witbaard on Sept. 12 for
allegedly violating his probation by leaving the state without
authorization. In a search of his car, officers found a kitchen
knife, an ax and photographs of women and preteen girls in bathing
suits and underwear, according to a probation report.</TE>
<TE>   Among the evidence reviewed by Utah officials were hairs and other
fibers from Witbaard's car. None of the evidence could be linked to
Smart, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Witbaard learned in a meeting with his attorney Tuesday that he
had been cleared. He had received death threats at Orange County Jail
after news reports about his possible connection to the abduction.</TE>
<TE>   "He's overjoyed that he's no longer a suspect," Lobato said.</TE>
<TE>   Witbaard still awaits prosecution for an alleged probation
violation and for allegedly failing to register with local police as
a sex offender.</TE>

<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Randy Payne approved an agreement in July in
which Witbaard, 51, pleaded guilty to felony sexual battery, instead
of more serious molestation charges, for groping two Buena Park girls
over their clothing.</TE>
<TE>   Witbaard was sentenced to five years' probation, ordered to attend
counseling and to register with local police as a convicted sex
offender.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas suspended Payne on Oct. 4 after the office started
reviewing how several of Payne's cases were handled.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys, prosecutors and judges said they were shocked
to learn of Payne's punishment, describing him as hard-working, tough
and fair.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Payne nor Rackauckas would discuss the discipline.</TE>
<TE>   Lobato said he hopes Rackauckas reinstates Payne.</TE>

at 66.98%. Secessionists continue to ponder filing a lawsuit.</DH>

<LD>The margin of defeat for San Fernando Valley secession grew slightly
Tuesday with a new tally of citywide votes that were not counted on
election night.</LD>
<LD>   The measure was defeated Nov. 5 by 66.98% of the vote, according
to the new results released Tuesday by the county, up from 66.93% on
election night.</LD>
<LD>   About 43,000 provisional ballots have yet to be reviewed
countywide, and some of those may be counted in a final tally.
Provisional ballots represent votes cast by people whose names do not
appear on a polling site's list of registered voters.</LD>
<TE>   There is no chance, however, the outcome for Valley and Hollywood
secession measures would change.</TE>
<TE>   The measure's lead in the Valley expanded by a hair Tuesday after
a tally of provisional ballots from Los Angeles. Those ballots were
not counted on election night.</TE>
<TE>   The election night count in the Valley had cityhood supporters
outnumbering opponents by 3,760 votes, but that margin was up Tuesday
to 3,770 votes in the Valley after 41,745 additional provisional and
absentee ballots were counted citywide.</TE>
<TE>   Officials hope to wrap up counting this week and certify the final
tally on Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe it's going to end up with a majority in the Valley,"
Valley VOTE chairman Richard Close said. "I think it's highly
unlikely it will be overturned based on the number of votes left."</TE>
<TE>   There are about 4,500 provisional Valley ballots -- all turned in
on election day -- that have not been reviewed to determine whether
they were properly cast and therefore should be counted, according to
a spokeswoman for the county registrar-recorder's office.</TE>
<TE>   Valley secession leaders are still considering whether to file a
lawsuit seeking to throw out the citywide vote and only count ballots
cast in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Close said that while secession failed to pass, he considers it a
victory that it carried in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "It sends a very strong message that the majority of voters in the
San Fernando Valley are displeased and want their own city," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Valley secession leaders have scheduled a meeting for Monday to
discuss their next steps. Close said it is very unlikely the public
meeting will include a discussion of legal options.</TE>
<TE>   Close said that issue is still being analyzed by attorneys
advising Valley VOTE.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally believe that if our attorney tells us there is a
good likelihood of success, we should proceed," Close said.</TE>
<TE>   But some activists who had considered such a move are now urging
the leadership not to go to court. Former mayoral candidate Bruce
Boyer said he consulted an attorney with the intent to file a suit
but has determined there are no winnable grounds to challenge the
state law that sets election rules.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was a guy who would sue over it, it was me," Boyer said.
"But I have concluded there is nothing to pursue. It's pointless."</TE>
<TE>   Boyer on Tuesday released a three-page analysis by his
Pasadena-based attorney, George M. Wallace, who determined the U.S.
and California constitutions give broad discretion to the state
Legislature to adopt laws governing the holding of elections.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace wrote that the courts would most likely uphold the
election laws unless the state Legislature has acted in a way that is
"openly discriminatory," and that efforts to pursue litigation over
the secession vote "will simply be a waste of resources."</TE>
<TE>   Boyer said he hopes to convey that conclusion to Close.</TE>
<TE>   "Tilting at windmills when you know you are going to lose creates
nothing but hostility," Boyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Similar concerns were voiced Tuesday by Benny Bernal, who finished
second in the Valley mayoral race, and Frank Sheftel, a former Valley
council candidate who is organizing a new group called the United
Valley Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   "My personal opinion is if the Valley had voted overwhelmingly for
secession we might have had a stronger case, but to just squeak by, I
don't think we have a good chance in court," Sheftel said.</TE>

<HD>Storm Fouls 3 South County Beaches</HD>
<DH>Health officials warn the public to stay out of water where
bacteria levels exceed state maximum.</DH>

<LD>The first big rainstorm of the year left Southern California with
crystal-clear skies and fresh-washed streets. But along the coast,
dirty runoff from the storm left some beaches littered with debris
and caused ocean pollution levels to spike.</LD>
<LD>   Water tests from Ventura County's southern coast detected three
areas where bacteria levels exceeded state maximums: portions of
McGrath Beach, Oxnard Beach and Point Mugu, said Richard Hauge,
coordinator of the county's Ocean Water Quality Monitoring Program.
Health officials posted signs warning people to avoid the water.</LD>
<LD>   "All we can do is advise," Hauge said. "We can't really force
people out of the water."</LD>
<TE>   Results from the county's northern coast, including its Ventura
beaches, will be available today.</TE>
<TE>   At one of those beaches, Surfers Point in Ventura, the post-storm
conditions made the coastline look pristine Tuesday--green-blue
water, balmy temperatures and a clear view of the Channel Islands.</TE>
<TE>   But surfers said the storm also washed something into the ocean
that was stinging their eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so uncomfortable out there. You can't shake it," said Roger
Rothwell, one of about 30 surfers in the water around noon.</TE>
<TE>   Rothwell, 52, has been surfing 40 years and knows better than to
paddle into the brown waves right after a major storm. But Tuesday's
conditions were too good to resist.</TE>
<TE>   "We just can't wait if they're good waves," he said. Surfing is
"like breath. You gotta breathe."</TE>
<TE>   Bacteria levels normally run high after a storm. But because of
the lack of rain in the Southland since January, there has been no
natural flushing of such pollutants as engine oil and exhaust fumes
that have settled on city streets.</TE>
<TE>   Other pollutants flowing to the ocean include fertilizers and
animal waste.</TE>
<TE>   Along the Los Angeles County coast, weekend water pollution levels
were the highest in a year and could take several more days before
dropping, said Eric Edwards, an environmental health specialist with
the county Health Department.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, bacteria readings in ocean water tests performed
over the weekend were so high that they exceeded the testing range of
16,000 organisms per 100 milliliter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going off scale," said Larry Honeybourne, with the county's
Health Care Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Even though no Southern California beaches were closed, officials
issued warnings to swimmers at more than three dozen, said Chad
Nelsen, environmental director for the Surfrider Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The advisories suggest that swimmers avoid the ocean for at least
72 hours after a storm.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, lifeguards and beach operations were attacking yet
another byproduct of the storm: the tons of trash that was swept off
streets, down gutters and into the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   "The beach is just covered with debris," said Pete Driscoll, a
Seal Beach lifeguard. "I took a walk down there at the water's edge,
and you can see everything from plants to plastic bottles to
Styrofoam cups, even shoes."</TE>
<TE>   Seal Beach lies downstream of the San Gabriel River, which begins
at the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and snakes its way
through dozens of cities in Los Angeles County before reaching the
ocean at Seal Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at that river," Driscoll said, "you can see the trash
from millions of people floating on down from all the cities inland."</TE>
