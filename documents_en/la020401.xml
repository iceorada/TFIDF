<HD>Some Heavy Lifting Is Ahead for Dion</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Can Celine Dion give the sagging music marketplace a titanic boost
this week? Dion has been a powerhouse in pop in the past with album
sales that match her arching vocals, but she stepped away from the
touring stage and recording studio for two years to devote time to
her family. Her new album, "A New Day Has Come," hits the sales chart
this week and has a chance to be the first title this year to sell
500,000 copies in its first week in stores.</LD>
<LD>   "The release schedule has been a little slow to get started this
year, but there have been some good signs in the last few weeks and
this Dion album is very strong out of the box," said Bob Bell, music
buyer for the Wherehouse chain of music stores. "It would be
optimistic to think it will break the 500,000 mark in the current
marketplace, but it has a chance. Anything over 400,000 right now is
spectacular."</LD>
<LD>   The sales reports of late have been so bleak that retailers will
take what they can get. They point to a variety of culprits--among
them the sluggish economy and rampant music downloading by non-paying
fans--but Bell and others say the most obvious factor has been a
dearth of reliable superstar releases.</LD>
<TE>   Dion's new disc should provide sustained help. Her CBS special
Sunday night will give her a second-week sales bump while her fan
base (which is older than the eager pop and rock fans who rush out to
buy new releases right away) will give her disc stamina through the
holidays this year and even next year, according to Bell.</TE>
<TE>   Still, retailers are already looking down the road for the albums
that can be even bigger blockbusters. The top candidates in sight:
Eminem's new album, currently scheduled for late May, and the Korn
release in mid-June.</TE>

<HD>Animators Draw Together at Forum</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced with industry layoffs and the outsourcing of work overseas,
Hollywood animators are in a grouchy and fearful mood these days.
They'll get a chance to vent their frustrations and learn how to
better cope with the downsizing of their craft when the "online water
cooler" Animation Nation hosts its fourth annual open forum today at
the Pickwick Center in Burbank. It begins at 1:30 p.m., and admission
is free.</LD>
<LD>   The gathering is intended to be a spirited discussion on the
current conditions and the future role of the animation artist in a
changing industry, according to Brian Reynolds, a moderator with the
online message forum www.animationnation.com.</LD>
<LD>   "The purpose of the forum is primarily a means of getting people
in the animation industry, the actual artists, to get a better
assessment of their own place in the industry," Reynolds said. "There
is a sense going around that animators are expendable and the studios
are abandoning or discarding their employees without assessing what
their contributions are."</LD>
<TE>   Reynolds said there is a fear among animators that traditional
two-dimensional animation is out of favor at the studios and that
computer-generated, three-dimensional animation such as "Shrek" and
"Monsters, Inc." will eventually replace it.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that there are rumors that Disney could scale back on 2D
animation after it releases "Sweating Bullets" at Thanksgiving 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Disney has plans to reduce its worldwide feature animation staff
to about 1,000 to 1,100 by next March from its high point of 2,000,
adapting the model used in live-action movies where crews are hired
on a film-by-film basis.</TE>
<TE>   But the studio has a number of 2D projects in the pipeline,
including "Lilo &amp; Stitch," which arrives in theaters this June,
followed by "Sweating Bullets" in 2003, "Bears" in 2004 and the
combination 2D/3D animated movie "My People" in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, DreamWorks has a number of 2D animation projects coming
up (though computer animation is also used in these films), including
"Spirit," a story about a horse in the Wild West, which opens May 24,
and "Sinbad," which is scheduled for release in 2003.</TE>

<LD>Time again for literature to remind us that perplexity is not
exclusive to this age.</LD>
<LD>   If ever a line were applicable today, for example, here it is:
"It's a strange, complicated life we live now." Yet instead, it's
what Paul Montague says wistfully to Lady Carbury in public
television's latest nostalgic feast for old-school Anglophiles who
like their 19th century Brits decadent and corrupt beneath cultured
exteriors.</LD>
<LD>   The source here is that prolific Victorian, Anthony Trollope,
whose "The Way We Live Now," as adapted delectably in four parts by
screenwriter Andrew Davies, is this "Masterpiece Theatre" season's
creamy eclair, a delicious social satire populated largely by fops,
fools and frauds.</LD>
<TE>   More than any other recent production, this one evokes the golden
age of "Masterpiece Theatre," when that strikingly durable PBS series
was dependably something to build a night around. Make that seven
Sunday nights in late 1984, when PBS aired a BBC hybrid of Trollope's
"The Warden" and "Barchester Towers," followed by the finest
miniseries of its time, "The Jewel in the Crown." Those were the
days.</TE>
<TE>   Heading the frauds tonight, but no icon of refinement, is Augustus
Melmotte, a scheming financier with a ruthless heart played with
dark, glowering, menacing, predatory gusto by David Suchet, U.K.
television's actor for all seasons, and best known to U.S. viewers as
Agatha Christie's fussy Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot. No mincing
steps from Suchet when dealing trouble as Trollope's fast-talking
scammer, who buys his way into society and even Parliament while
plucking his victims like fresh blooms.</TE>
<TE>   It's Melmotte's publicized arrival in London from central
Europe--a shrewd, mysterious little gargoyle wrapping himself in pomp
and palatial splendor--that has the attention of London's stiff upper
lips. "I've heard the man's a Jew, a scoundrel and a swindler,"
sniffs a moldy aristocrat.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, however, he and other greedy gentry are blissfully sitting
on the board of stuffed shirts that Melmotte chooses to rubber-stamp
the South Central Pacific and Mexican Railway, a phony enterprise
that will sucker investors as well as Montague (Cillian Murphy), an
earnest civil engineer who thinks he's going to be building a
railroad in America.</TE>
<TE>   As in other British novels of the period, Trollope has money,
either inherited or attained otherwise, determining how high his
characters rise in stature.</TE>
<TE>   So it is that the disgustingly affluent Melmotte, though reviled
privately, is fawned over despite being so loutish and uncouth that
he gestures with his dripping soup spoon while dining, and his
cloddish French wife has to wipe his mouth after he stuffs it with
pastry.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing speaks louder to these Victorians than the almighty pound,
however, their expectations coinciding with wealth in a setting where
finishing "the season" in London is essential for young women
desiring proper husbands of means, and where a misbehaving fellow can
earn "a frightful ragging from the chaps at the club."</TE>
<TE>   "The Way We Live Now" uncovers an attic full of musty upper crusts
and dandies along with incestuous tangles galore, starting with the
once-prosperous family of Lady Carbury (Cheryl Campbell), now too
poor even to pay the wine merchant.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder this happily widowed matron, her ambition as plump as
her breasts, is overjoyed that her worthless cad of a son, Felix
(Matthew Macfadyen), hopes to restore the family fortune by marrying
Melmotte's daughter, Marie (Shirley Henderson), for her money. And no
wonder she's furious that her virtuous daughter, Hetta (Paloma
Baeza), has rejected a marriage proposal from her rich cousin, Roger
(Douglas Hodge), because she's fallen for Montague.</TE>
<TE>   You have to admire Lady Carbury for being candid about her
intentions. While the drunken, lascivious Felix gambles away
everything at cards, hers, at least, are on the table. "What a lovely
couple they make," she coos about Felix and that hotblooded little
bundle, Marie, played to the glorious hilt by scene-stealing
Henderson.</TE>
<TE>   "The Way We Live Now" owes much to director David Yates, who has
jolly magnificent fun with Trollope--in one instance having tall,
handsome, elegant, haughty Felix step around a pile of horse manure
en route to asking Melmotte for Marie's hand, then blunder into it on
his way out after being rejected and overmatched by the crude little
tyrant he hoped to make his father-in-law. Melmotte's choice for
Marie is the rich nonentity Lord Nidderdale.</TE>
<TE>   Coming near the end of Part 2, moreover, is a spectacular banquet
that Melmotte throws for the emperor of China. Keep your eye not on
the foreigners, though, but the snobs who smugly ridicule Melmotte
behind his back, seen gorging themselves at the 40-foot table he has
set out for them. In fact, they are the ones being devoured, by their
host.</TE>
<TE>   The story gets a bit choppy later when Felix's secret girlfriend
from the countryside (Maxine Peake) and Montague's former flame from
the U.S. (Miranda Otto) converge in London, and the melodrama
thickens when fissures in Melmotte's world widen to cracks.</TE>
<TE>   Yet wry observations and biting satire surface even during moments
that may appear serious, as when a rich Jewish banker withdraws the
marriage proposal he made to a desperate-to-wed young woman after
learning she's as anti-Semitic as her snooty parents. Her incredulous
summation: "Jilted by a ... Jew."</TE>
<TE>   It was a strange, complicated life then, as it is now.</TE>

unsuitable for young children).</TE>

<HD>Another Weak Whitney Biennial</HD>
<DH>Paucity of L.A. works is among the shortcomings of a
declining show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The continuing irrelevance of the Whitney Biennial can be conveyed
for the 2002 installment in just a few words: five artists from Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Eight, if you count the exhibition's media component (which,
because of the time-bound nature of film and video, can only be seen
in its entirety by a dedicated local audience). That's out of a total
of 113 artists, making this the largest biennial in decades.</LD>
<LD>   It's also the same raw number of L.A. artists as in the 2000
biennial. That ludicrous show featured 97 artists overall. Relatively
speaking, L.A.'s art shrinks to near invisibility this year. The
claim that the biennial surveys significant new American art can't be
made with a straight face.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, none of that would matter if the 2002 biennial were a
knockout display, with plenty of terrific work to keep you occupied.
It's not. About four things stayed with me when I left the museum.</TE>
<TE>   Vija Celmins' luminous gray paintings of fragile spider webs trap
your wandering gaze as if it were an errant fly. Evan Holloway's
sculptures productively weave natural forms into cultural processes,
as when he cubes the organic form of a tree branch according to a
mathematical system.</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch Perlman creates an extended document of private,
internalized fantasy, in four dozen pinhole-camera photographs that
show the menagerie he repeatedly made, demolished, remade and
demolished again in his flotsam-filled studio. And Stephen Dean's
"Pulse" is a delirious, beautifully edited short video of the annual
festival of Holi in Uttar Pradesh, India, where the return of spring
is celebrated by throngs throwing clouds of pure pigment, glittery
mica and tinted water. Like them, you get intoxicated on swirling
color.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, though, this biennial is banal. Whitney curator Lawrence
R. Rinder has assembled a dreary array of photographs, video and
Web-based work, some installations, drawings, comics and a couple of
crafts, with few sculptures and paintings anywhere in sight.</TE>
<TE>   Typical is "a small world ...," a 1999 installation by the team of
Sanford Biggers and Jennifer Zackin. Sitting in a stage set designed
to look like a middle-class suburban den from the 1970s, you watch a
pair of short, Super-8 home movies projected side-by-side.
Sociologically, it's interesting: Two actual birthday parties, one
for a black child and one for a Jewish child, are represented almost
identically in the amateur films; class now says at least as much as
race in how American society is constructed. Artistically, though,
it's wafer-thin. Once seen and grasped, there's not much reason to
look at "a small world ... " again. The piece is an elaborate
one-liner. What makes it typical for this biennial is the elevation
of visual culture over art, the general over the specific.</TE>
<TE>   In the catalog, Rinder writes that he went after work mostly made
by the "younger generation" that seeks to "reclaim the individual's
expressive capacity from the corporate monolith of mass-media
entertainment" and that avoids "the market-dominated trends of the
mainstream art world." What he apparently wanted--and certainly
got--was a show worthy of an alternative space, circa 1977. In what
must be the most expensive alternative space show ever organized, it
suffers a serious case of venue dysfunction.</TE>
<TE>   We've seen a lot of self-righteous art in recent decades that
critiques the Media Industrial Complex of Global Capital (eek!), and
to his credit, Rinder leaves most of that out. But the bugbear still
guides this vacuous show, if only through genteel avoidance.</TE>
<TE>   Given the multibillion-dollar culture industry that, for art, has
headquarters at places like, oh, the Whitney Museum of American Art,
the show seems naive, if not irresponsible. Especially when the
curator then panders to the hometown crowd by including 64 New
Yorkers because, as he also writes, the city is "the economic center
of the art world and, for better or worse, the place where countless
ambitious artists come to make their mark."</TE>
<TE>   The Whitney Biennial has been extraneous for at least a decade
now. Trying to have it both ways is a pretty sure bet for continuing
the triviality.</TE>

<HD>Casting a Wider Net for Kids</HD>
<DH>Characters of greater diversity signal Hollywood's attempts
to speak to today's young viewers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When executives at Nickelodeon put out a casting call in the
mid-1990s for a kids' mystery show, "The Mystery Files of Shelby
Wink," one young actress impressed them more than any other
tryout--Irene Ng. But there was a hitch--Ng is Asian American and the
show was written for an Anglo girl and her family.</LD>
<LD>   What might have seemed a problem for some companies Nickelodeon
approached from the opposite direction--they saw Ng's ethnicity as a
bonus. Because she was the best actress executives auditioned, they
changed the role around her--the character became Shelby Woo. They
rewrote the script and cast veteran actor Pat Morita ("The Karate
Kid") as her grandfather.</LD>
<LD>   "When we found Irene, we said we have to change this and how could
we do this?'" said Paula Kaplan, senior vice president of talent for
Nickelodeon. "What we do differently here is that we are open-minded
and try to be flexible as to who is right for the part.... It's more
work, but people get excited about seeing great acting," she said.
"And we want to make sure we are reflecting what is in a kid's life.
The world is a big melting pot now, and what we do is try to reflect
their lives."</LD>
<TE>   The way things are usually done--at least with big studio
movies--is the reverse. For example, the main character in John
Ridley's original story for "Three Kings" was written for a black
lead. The studio recast it and made George Clooney the lead, with Ice
Cube as one of the co-stars. But in the world of kids and young
adults in 2002, diversity is not a strange concept, at least in the
major cities. Companies that cater to this market are creating shows
and casting talent that mirrors an increasingly multiethnic America.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like a very clear-cut decision was made," said Nina
Jacobson, president of Buena Vista Motion Picture Group, which
comprises the Walt Disney, Touchstone and Hollywood film labels. But
she said the company recognized "our movies should reflect the
reality of our cultural world." Buena Vista's just-released "The
Rookie" bears out that reality, with young actors Jay Hernandez, Rick
Gonzalez and Angelo Spizzirri co-starring with Dennis Quaid, a West
Texas high school teacher who tries out for a major league baseball
team.</TE>
<TE>   MTV and Nickelodeon have forged a path with movies such as
"Clockstoppers" (which opened Friday), last year's comedy concert
film "The Original Kings of Comedy" and "Save the Last Dance," which
included an interracial love story and made more than $100 million in
its U.S. theatrical release. Even Miramax's specialty division,
Dimension Films, found itself in diverse territory with last year's
hit family film, "Spy Kids." Directed by Robert Rodri guez and
starring Antonio Banderas, Carla Gugino, Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara,
"Spy Kids" made more than $150 million worldwide. It was a no-brainer
to produce a sequel, and "Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams"
comes out Aug. 7. All of the original stars have returned for the
sequel.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids don't see diversity," said Bob Weinstein, head of Dimension.
"They just see Carmen and Juni"--the title characters.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein was always confident Rodriguez would deliver a solid
action-adventure movie. The Austin-based director wanted to make the
cast Latino; at another company, that detail could have easily been
"homogenized to be white, like in the days of 'Home Alone,'"
Weinstein said, referring to the 1990 Macaulay Culkin blockbuster.</TE>
<TE>   One of the reasons some major movies have lacked diversity is the
studios' dependence on the international market for a big chunk of
their profits. On the most expensive movies, risk-averse studios try
to hedge their bets with stars who are reliable export commodities.</TE>
<TE>   Kids' movies are produced in the low- to mid-budget range ($20
million to $40 million, or less), and with those budgets, it's not
difficult to make money in the domestic market. Most studios do not
expect to rake in a lot of money overseas with these films.</TE>
<TE>   "The movies we are making are modestly budgeted," said Weinstein.
"Spy Kids" made the bulk of its money "in the American marketplace,
but we are building the international marketplace for the second
one."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood is a trendsetter in fashion, style and many other areas,
Jacobson says, and it is the studios' role to embrace diversity.</TE>
<TE>   "These things become self-fulfilling," she continued. "If you make
a great pop movie, then people around the world will want to see it.
I don't think you will get punished for making the right creative
choices."</TE>
<TE>   It's not as though the kids' movies are not moneymakers. It's a
bottom-line business, and the smarter companies know their audience.</TE>
<TE>   According to a Nickelodeon December 2000 study and the National
Council of La Raza, children are more ethnically diverse than the
rest of the population. By 2020, nearly half of all American kids
will be nonwhite. Currently, nonwhite kids watch more television per
week than white children. African American children average 26.7
hours a week, Latinos 21.4 hours and white children 19.3. No
statistics were available for Asian children.</TE>
<TE>   At Nickelodeon, the Latino-themed series "Taina" and "The Brothers
Garcia" have seen dramatic ratings gains. "Taina," which premiered in
2001, saw its ratings more than double in its second year. Ratings
for "The Brothers Garcia," the top-rated live-action show on
Nickelodeon, grew even more sharply in its second season.</TE>
<TE>   "Good business has always flowed with what is good for kids," said
Albie Hecht, president of film and television for Nickelodeon. "We
want to reflect what is in a kid's world. And what is in their world
is an enormous amount of diversity that they accept."Nickelodeon is
diverse not only in terms of casting, but also in terms of nurturing
talent behind the camera. The company has an internship program for
minority writers that pays them a salary they can live on. They also
have an executive mentoring program. Even their animated shows--such
as the "Rugrats" series and, more recently, "Jimmy Neutron: Boy
Genius"--include diversity. Jimmy Neutron's best friend, Sheen, was
voiced by the stand-up comedian Jeff Garcia. In the "Rugrats" series,
one of the central families is of mixed ethnicity. "Rugrats--the
Movie" grossed more than $150 million worldwide in 1998, and the
follow-up "Rugrats in Paris" in 2000 grossed $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   But the key to diversity, these executives and others stress, is
not allowing it to become tokenism. Casting calls are open to anyone,
they say, and roles are given to the best actors, regardless of race.
The characters' race and ethnicity are woven into the story.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an added bonus," said Christina Vidal, star of "Taina," a
modern-day "Fame" for "tweens" (a relatively new demographic
category, targeting kids between the ages of 9 and 14).</TE>
<TE>   Ethnicity "is not thrown in everyone's face--it's not like there
are subtitles and rice and beans on every show," said Vidal, who is
Puerto Rican. "It gives everyone a chance to see Latin people in a
different light--like 'they are just like everybody else.' Once in a
while we add some flavor and culture so people can see that, but it
is not so far left field that they can't relate to it."</TE>
<TE>   To find such talent, Nickelodeon and MTV cast wide nets. They go
to high school drama departments, art schools with diverse
populations and so-called boutique casting shops that focus on
minority talent. Hiring new talent often involves risk, but Hecht
says that so far, the gambles have paid off.</TE>
<TE>   One such gamble was 28-year-old Paula Garces, the co-star of
Nickelodeon's "Clockstoppers," an action-fantasy film released by
Paramount. Garces, who was born in New York's Spanish Harlem, was
raised in Colombia, her mother's native land.</TE>
<TE>   Her role in the film was not originally written for a Latina, but
her audition, in an open call, caught casting executives' eye.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing stereotypical about me at all," said Garces,
whose character, Francesca de la Cruz, is Venezuelan. "For the first
time I didn't have to play a character with the stupid accent or
anything [negative] against Latinos. It was just wonderful."</TE>

<HD>The Excitement Level Builds From Piano to Forte</HD>
<DH>Music: A buzz of interest greets the Rachmaninoff keyboard
competition as it winnows an international field down to six
finalists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The circular stairwell connecting the main level to the bottom floor
of the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena traces the pattern of a
question mark. It's an apt--if unintentional--symbol for the first
Rachmaninoff International Competition and Festival, which finished
its stint at the museum's theater Saturday before moving to the
Pasadena Civic Auditorium on Tuesday for the final rounds and an
awards ceremony this Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The big question, of course, is who will win the top prize of
$30,000 and a Kawai concert grand piano valued at $28,000.</LD>
<LD>   Popular favorites emerged by the end of the week--Alessio Cioni,
23, of Italy, and Jan Krzysztof Broja, 29, of Poland.</LD>
<TE>   "Cioni is the sun, Broja is the moon, and the rest of them are
planets," one fan said, speaking for many, while the audience awaited
the judges' announcement of the finalists Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   But other queries came up of over the course of the week while the
30 initial candidates from around the world--many of whom have been
winners in other contests--were whittled down to 12 semifinalists.</TE>
<TE>   Is this the best way to find talent? Talent for what? Winning
competitions? There were previous Rachmaninoff competitions in Russia
during the Soviet era. What relationship does this one have to them?</TE>
<TE>   Less seriously, could anyone reasonably expect the judges--or
audiences, for that matter--to survive 12 performances of
Rachmaninoff's Second Sonata, a work mandated for each second-round
contestant, within three days?</TE>
<TE>   One of these questions, at least, was quickly answered.</TE>
<TE>   This event has no association with any previous Rachmaninoff
contest held in Russia, according to Armen Ter-Tatevosian, president
of the competition. "Alexander Rachmaninoff, grandson of
[composer-conductor-pianist] Sergei, has agreed to associate the name
of Rachmaninoff only with this competition," Ter-Tatevosian said in a
prepared statement. "This is the inaugural year of the competition,
which is envisioned to remain in the U.S. permanently. It is planned
to take place at least every four years."</TE>
<TE>   The first round began March 22 with blocks of four 40-minute
recitals. It took four days to hear the 30 contestants. For the
audience, the only rule was to turn off cell phones and beepers, but
even so, a few phones would go off in the coming days.</TE>
<TE>   Without discussion, however, the audience--made up largely of
pianists, music teachers and community members--decided that applause
after pieces was inappropriate until the end of each recital.</TE>
<TE>   Their silence immediately established a serious and intense
atmosphere for the event, whether the 298-seat theater was half full
or, increasingly during the week, sold out. Lines for the unreserved
seating began forming an hour before the doors opened. Folks quickly
began learning they had to rush in to get the seats with the best
sight lines of the keyboard.</TE>
<TE>   During the second round, which began Thursday with each of the 12
semifinalists playing for an hour, the audience's self-imposed rule
went out the window. People applauded after each piece. There were
occasional bravos, and one young girl handed up a bouquet of flowers
to the first contestant, Russian Evgeni Mikhailov, after he finished.</TE>
<TE>   The 12-member jury sat sequestered in the balcony, which was
off-limits to the public. (Because of scheduling problems, pianist
Vladimir Ashkenazy will join the jury only during the final round
this week.) Neither jurors nor contestants--all of whom often mingled
with the crowd in the lobby outside the museum theater during the
breaks--were permitted to talk about the competition. The contestants
could sign autographs, however, and they did. Fans', jurors' and
competitors' voices mingled in a buzz of Russian, English, Japanese,
Chinese and Tagalog.</TE>
<TE>   "I always come to the semifinals because the most interesting
pianists often get washed out at this stage," said one experienced
musician.</TE>
<TE>   Why washed out?</TE>
<TE>   "Because they're individuals and they don't conform to judges'
ideas of how a piece should be played. This is a very cruel ordeal. I
saw one contestant worried sick, pacing back and forth in the lobby.
I told him to forget about the audience and just play for himself."</TE>
<TE>   By Thursday, audience favorites had begun to emerge. Some people
named Mikhailov or another Russian, Mark Maikov, 26. Others said,
"Wait until you hear Ning An."</TE>
<TE>   "No, you have to hear Mizuka Kano."</TE>
<TE>   "You missed Broja? His Debussy was wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   The equation shifted dramatically Friday afternoon, however, when
Cioni of Italy stunned the audience with his mature, brilliant,
probing playing of Rachmaninoff's Second Sonata, Liszt's monumental
Sonata in B Minor and, to top it off, Prokofiev's nonstop Toccata,
Opus 11.</TE>
<TE>   At the end, most of the audience jumped to its feet and yelled
multiple bravos. The modest, handsome Italian, whose mop of hair
makes him look a little like Evegny Kissin, was surrounded during the
break by autograph seekers.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know about juries," cautioned an audience member. "You
never know what they're thinking."</TE>
<TE>   From then on, however, just about everyone who had heard him named
Cioni as their first choice. Their second varied. (A $3,000 Audience
Prize, donated by Old Town Music Company in Pasadena and based on
audience votes, will be awarded Saturday.)</TE>
<TE>   The jury returned its verdicts Saturday evening after a
surprisingly short (less than a half-hour) deliberation. Executive
director of the competition, Douglas Yoder, announced from the stage
the six finalists who will play one Beethoven concerto Tuesday or
Wednesday with the Pasadena Symphony, and one Rachmaninoff concerto
Thursday or Friday, with the Moscow Radio Symphony, at the Pasadena
Civic Theater.</TE>
<TE>   In alphabetical order, the finalists are Feodor Amirov, 20, of
Russia; Ning An, 25, United States; Jan Krzysztof Broja, 29, Poland;
Alessio Cioni, 23, Italy; Mizuka Kano, 23, Japan; and Evgeni
Mikhailov, 29, Russia.</TE>
<TE>   They will not necessarily play in this order, and thankfully, they
won't be performing Rachmaninoff's Second Sonata.</TE>

<HD>Enrique Iglesias an Energetic Crowd Pleaser</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A true romantic can give affection just as easily as he receives it.
So the most memorable moments of Enrique Iglesias' performance
Saturday at the Shrine Auditorium weren't musical, and they didn't
come during those long periods when throngs of excited women rushed
the stage.</LD>
<LD>   They came instead when the singer showed he was actually paying
attention to the immediate needs of his fans.</LD>
<LD>   First, he rescued a young woman who was grappling with security
guards, leading her safely backstage without ever interrupting the
song in progress.</LD>
<TE>   Then, near the close of his 90-minute concert, Iglesias reached
over the more frantic fans up front to pluck an astonished woman from
the crowd for a passionate serenade of his hit single "Hero."</TE>
<TE>   If there is nothing particularly unique or lasting about his
music, Iglesias' concert was nonetheless richly entertaining and
exceptionally performed. Slick but not bloodless, the music was never
patronizing or willfully shallow.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the uptempo pop songs, including "Don't Turn Off the
Lights," were largely carried by his seven-piece band and three
backup singers, turning Iglesias into more of a band conductor. But
as a singer he was fully engaged in the most romantic material.</TE>
<TE>   Iglesias was not the brooding male model type pictured on his
latest album cover, but a likable, energetic showman dressed in a
purple football jersey and a knit cap. Often sprinting and hopping
across the stage between verses, the singer was a natural crowd
pleaser.</TE>
<TE>   In that way, Iglesias was far more like his father, Spanish
crooner Julio Iglesias, than all the heavy-breathing romantics
working under the Latin lover label.</TE>
<TE>   For the younger singer, that category has little relevance to a
repertoire that is rooted more and more in mainstream pop and rock.</TE>
<TE>   Iglesias did perform a handful of Spanish-language tear-jerkers
from his early career, tapping a pleasing emotional vein. But he
seemed just as happy to play the occasional modern rock flourish or a
salvageable rendition of Steve Miller's "Space Cowboy."</TE>
<TE>   The concert also called for the occasional theatrical moment, as
when Iglesias and a female singer traded some risque petting.</TE>
<TE>   But while the most-excited members of the audience were clearly
women, Iglesias also drew cheers from men holding their hands in the
air and swaying to the music.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe for good reason. "If guys want to get lucky," the singer
said at one point, "you come to an Enrique Iglesias concert."</TE>

<HD>'Panic Room' Is No.1; 'Rookie' Comes in Third</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GERMAIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moviegoers were on full alert for "Panic Room."</LD>
<LD>   Starring Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker, the thriller about a
mother and daughter hiding from burglars in their home's
fortress-like sanctuary took in $30.2 million to debut as the top
weekend film, according to studio estimates Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "This was the third weekend in a row with a movie opening over $30
million. That would be good news in the summer, let alone March,"
said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracking firm
Exhibitor Relations.</LD>
<TE>   Dennis Quaid's "The Rookie" opened in third place with $15.8
million. Quaid stars in the real-life story of Jim Morris, a science
teacher in his mid-30s who finally achieved his life's goal of
pitching in the major leagues.</TE>
<TE>   The science-fiction tale "Clockstoppers," about a teen with a
watch that can halt time, premiered in fifth place with $10.1
million. The movie was directed by Jonathan Frakes, who plays Will
Riker in the "Star Trek" franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Danny DeVito's black comedy "Death to Smoochy," starring Robin
Williams as a deposed children's show host seeking vengeance against
his replacement (Edward Norton), tanked with just $4.3 million,
coming in at No. 7.</TE>
<TE>   The animated "Ice Age" became the first movie released this year
to top $100 million. The film remained in the No. 2 spot for the
second consecutive weekend, putting its 17-day total at $117.3
million. "Blade II," last weekend's No. 1 movie, fell to fourth place
with $13.2 million, a 59% drop from opening weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Cashing in on its recent best picture Oscar, "A Beautiful Mind"
expanded to 1,560 theaters, up 105, and took in $4 million. Its total
rose to $161 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" joined "Harry
Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" as the only movies released in 2001
to hit the $300-million mark.</TE>
<TE>   The top 12 films grossed $114.4 million, up 39% from the same
weekend a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Panic Room," directed by David Fincher ("Seven"), drew an even
mix of men and women and a good split between older and younger
adults, said Jeff Blake, president of worldwide
marketing/distribution for Sony, which released the film.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it really was a full-meal movie that appealed pretty
equally all around, with a concept everybody can relate to," Blake
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Smoochy" distributor Warner Bros. was "disappointed in the
results, but at least we have positive word of mouth from those that
attended," said Dan Fellman, head of distribution. "It's a dark
comedy, and there are movies of this nature that started off slow but
held on well week after week."</TE>

<HD>Is a Sitcom a Hit Just Because the Network Says So?</HD>
<DH>Television: Despite the hype being given to the edgier
comedies, audiences are drawn to family sitcoms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC will air episodes of "Watching Ellie," its midseason comedy
starring Julia-Louis Dreyfus, Tuesday night at 8:30, then again at
9:30. The show has had a limited run (only five episodes have played
thus far), but already it's been declared a hit by NBC and written
off by the media.</LD>
<LD>   So which is it? Somewhere between these two extremes lies the
show's true status for next fall: Undetermined. Undetermined but
closely watched, a predicament caused partly by NBC and partly by the
media's unabated fascination with the afterlives of the "Seinfeld"
cast.</LD>
<LD>   The difficulty of launching new hit comedies is an old story
getting older. Still, there also appears to be a disconnect between
what audiences are actually embracing and more daring or critically
lauded programs networks are eager to brand as hits.</LD>
<TE>   "Watching Ellie" is a show that tells its story each week in real
time and by the producer's own admission doesn't adhere to the
traditional setup/joke rhythm. Yet while it's been put through the
spin cycle, people are actually heading in bigger numbers to CBS'
"Baby Bob," a broad, gimmicky midseason family show featuring a baby
technologically enhanced to converse as an adult.</TE>
<TE>   For all the talk that networks need to reinvent, or at least
tweak, the situation comedy to ensure its survival, the genre's most
recent successes look like television's stock in trade--amiable shows
featuring nuclear families with comedians as leads.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's new series "Bernie Mac" is probably the new critical hit of
the year, both for comedian Mac's world view and the show's
execution, but is it necessarily the future of network comedy?</TE>
<TE>   Based on ratings performance, anyway, the future looks more like
the past. Last season, CBS' "Yes, Dear," starring Anthony Clark, and
ABC's "My Wife and Kids," starring Damon Wayans, emboldened the
notion that a tired recipe (Take comedian. Add cute kids. Stir.)
still has mass appeal.</TE>
<TE>   At ABC, which has struggled more than any of the big four networks
to develop sustainable sitcoms in recent seasons, "My Wife and Kids"
arrived as a godsend, if not an outright hit--so much so that the
decent performance this season of another family comedy, "According
to Jim," has convinced ABC parent Disney to put its development
future into like-minded shows.</TE>
<TE>   Half of the 14 comedy pilots picked up by Disney's Touchstone
Television, which supplies most of the pilot product to ABC, feature
families with kids.</TE>
<TE>   This may fill some comedy writers with dread and prompt others to
call to mind H.L. Mencken's famous line that "No one in this world,
so far as I know ... has ever lost money by underestimating the
intelligence of the great masses of the plain people."</TE>
<TE>   "Advertisers, in the end, are looking to reach a particular
segment of the audience in the least objectionable way," said Bill
Carroll, vice president/director of programming for the Katz
Television Group, a consulting firm. "Unless there's the very special
episode of 'According to Jim,' most weeks it's pretty down the
middle."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem new sitcoms face is that the networks are so
starved for hits there is a "win now" mentality, pressuring
executives to label shows overnight successes.</TE>
<TE>   While dramatic series such as "The West Wing" and "CSI: Crime
Scene Investigation" have broken out in recent seasons, popular
comedies have proven more elusive. Last week, when "Watching Ellie's"
numbers ticked back up after several weeks of tumbling ratings, NBC
Entertainment President Jeff Zucker complained that his new series
wasn't getting a fair shake.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be that the networks took a bunch of [grief] for not
being patient with shows. Now we're taking a bunch of [grief] if we
have one bad week," he said, referring to the alacrity with which the
media were foretelling "Watching Ellie's" doom. That perception was
fueled by mixed messages from the network itself in terms of when the
show was scheduled to complete its spring tryout.</TE>
<TE>   In what felt like a move made to beat back the wolves, NBC
announced last week that two more episodes of "Watching Ellie" will
air April 9 and 16.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy Newman, co-creator and executive producer of "According to
Jim," mostly sees a likable star, Jim Belushi, used to good advantage
in the time period after Wayans' show.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the scenes, Newman says she and writing partner Jonathan
Stark are doing nothing more provocative than bringing solid family
scenarios to the masses.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of this country is families with kids," Newman said. "They
tune in for a moment, and they say, 'Hey, this is like us.'"</TE>
<TE>   And that, in a sense, is all there is to it. "There's nothing
astonishing to say here. It's comfortable," Newman said.</TE>
<TE>   A little more astonishing, perhaps, is the performance so far of
"Baby Bob," the CBS comedy developed from a talking baby character
that first appeared on TV in commercials for an Internet service. The
show has averaged nearly 15 million viewers and sustained the
audience of its lead-in show, "The King of Queens."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, "Baby Bob" posted an even stronger rating among
advertiser-coveted 18-to-49-year-old viewers than "Watching Ellie," a
show aimed squarely at the hearts and minds of urbanites.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun, family entertainment that is a bit of a throwback to
some of the comedies that a lot of the baby boomers grew up with, and
yet has been contemporized with the effects and the techniques that
we use," said Perry Simon, president of Viacom Productions, which
produces the show.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of a pliable public, some networks seem to be in
the awkward position of trying to will along more refined tastes,
insisting edgy new shows are edgy new hits before the ink has gone
dry on all the good press.</TE>
<TE>   "What is the definition of a hit these days?" said Jordan Levin,
entertainment president of the WB. "The definition of a hit is 'Is it
retaining its lead-in within 85%, or is it something that brings
people to the screen?'"</TE>
<TE>   Levin pointed to the WB's first-year comedy "Reba," starring
country star Reba McEntire as a divorced mom. The show has averaged
only 4.3 million viewers this season (less than a fifth the weekly
audience for "Friends" or "Everybody Loves Raymond"), but it exceeds
the network's average, builds on its lead-in show and does well with
the WB's core audience of teens and young adults.</TE>
<TE>   Here, in other words, with all of those caveats, is a comedy hit.
So too is NBC's first-year comedy "Scrubs," according to Zucker, who
deems it the "No. 1 new comedy of this entire season. However you
want to measure it."</TE>
<TE>   But how do you want to measure it? In adults 18 to 49, which is
what NBC insists is all that really matters, because that demographic
dictates advertising rates, "Scrubs" has indeed performed well for a
first-year show--better than anything except NBC's canceled "Inside
Schwartz" and its midseason series "Leap of Faith," both of which
were given exaggerated head starts by virtue of following a true hit,
"Friends."</TE>
<TE>   "Scrubs," about medical interns, has been airing most of the
season after another true hit, "Frasier." Its average 11.5 million
viewers is encouraging, but on the flip side, "Scrubs" loses nearly a
quarter of "Frasier's" audience.</TE>
<TE>   Is it a hit then? Regardless, NBC has been screaming about
"Scrubs" all season, partly because the show reflects the network's
self-image and partly because, well, you have to scream these days to
be heard. Fox, similarly, is screaming about "Andy Richter Controls
the Universe" and "Greg the Bunny," two midseason comedies that have
showed promise in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We do add to the hysteria," Zucker said, noting that the networks
are confusing viewers with all of their hit-show pronouncements.</TE>
<TE>   As for "Watching Ellie," Zucker, who has been politicking hard for
the show, said the decision to schedule an additional two episodes to
air this month was more than spin: NBC wants to see how well the show
holds up before deciding its fate this spring.</TE>
<TE>   "As we go into scheduling in May," he said, "we want to know
exactly what we have."</TE>

<HD>An Elegant 'Tosca,' With Voices to Match</HD>
<DH>San Diego Opera's revival of a visually rich staging of the
Puccini classic benefits from distinguished singing in the lead
roles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Jean-Pierre Ponnelle production of Puccini's "Tosca," created in
1978 for San Francisco Opera, returned to San Diego Saturday night in
Civic Theatre. It remains an elegant, rich visual setting. And
opening night, with principals Galina Gorchakova, Richard Leech and
Kimm Julian, was generally as distinguished as Ponnelle's
surroundings--as strong a performance as one can remember in this
theater.</LD>
<LD>   Veteran San Diego conductor Edoardo Muller led a passionate,
urgent performance while giving the singers as much musical space as
practical; the San Diego Opera Orchestra played with unusual
transparency and brightness.</LD>
<LD>   The staging by general director Ian Campbell rang true in almost
every moment, and was detailed abundantly and appropriately. Only a
few odd touches--as in the loud miking of the shepherd boy at the top
of Act III, apparently to make the sound emanate from inside the
auditorium--jarred the observer. For the most part, the acting of
this melodramma emerged as natural and unexaggerated; and that is
saying a lot in an opera that often suffers from over-the-top
histrionics.</LD>
<TE>   In this generally credible atmosphere, only Floria Tosca herself,
the beautiful Siberian soprano Gorchakova, strayed from this norm.
Her singing is often handsome and reliable, if finally monochromatic.
But her acting, usually serviceable, can descend to the primitive and
semaphoric. She looks so convincing, and sings so well, one wants to
ignore her lurching and mincing; but one cannot.</TE>
<TE>   Leech, memorable from his Cavaradossi with Los Angeles Opera last
June, repeats that role, for which he is so well suited. Whatever his
fans pay, he gives them their money's worth. He looks heroic, and he
delivers great sound. One wishes only that he could scale down that
sound for a touching "O dolci mani" in Act III.</TE>
<TE>   Imposing, menacing and carrying himself with great elegance, the
American baritone Julian seems born to the role of Scarpia. He brings
force and power to all the musical climaxes of the first two acts.
The voice is strong, but not as suave as the villain's most seductive
moments require. The rest of the cast performed capably. Francois
Loup created a believable and touching Sacristan; as Angelotti and
Sciarrone, Jamie Offenbach was overstated, but sympathetic; Joseph Hu
(Spoletta) and Robert Olson (Shepherd) proved solid.</TE>
<TE>   Holding the entire production together visually were the mellow
and atmospheric lighting designs by Marie Barrett, who was assisted
by Chris Rynne.</TE>

<HD>A Most Merry 'Widow,' Indeed, Staged by London City Opera</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A waggish critic once described Herbert von Karajan's Teutonic way
with "The Merry Widow" as "Brahms' Requiem performed to the tunes of
Lehar." As one watched the touring London City Opera's distinctly
British take on the "The Merry Widow" at the Cerritos Center for the
Performing Arts Saturday night, a paraphrase of that came to
mind--Gilbert and Sullivan, with tunes by Lehar.</LD>
<LD>   At times, in fact, the unwary listener would hardly have guessed
that this piece is right at the heart of Viennese operetta.</LD>
<LD>   But the important thing was, the approach worked. The very proper,
deadpan British accents in the dialogue; the crisp enunciation and
underlying layer of dignity in most of the singing; the classicism
and absence of cloying sentiment from Peter Oberfrank's compact pit
orchestra; and even the frantic music-hall madness in the ensembles
of Acts 2 and 3 created an English never-never land that was
entertaining and valid on its own terms.</LD>
<TE>   This Terry John Bates-directed production blew into town near the
end of a 70-city American tour that began in January. Yet the
energetic cast betrayed hardly any signs of road-weariness.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, when a throat infection forced the announced Hanna out of
the 8 p.m. performance, Fiona Mariah, who had sung the role earlier
that afternoon, took it on in the evening as well, sporting a light,
fluttering soprano well-suited for operetta.</TE>
<TE>   Baritone Sam McElroy made a pleasing, resonant Count Danilo;
Rebecca Bode (Valencienne) and Neil Allen (Camille) were an
acceptable pair of illicit lovers; and Francois Testory a comically
mincing Njegus.</TE>
<TE>   This, then, was not a "Merry Widow" of glamorous voices and
authentic whipped-cream atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   However, this troupe could convey the zest of the music more
winningly than many major-league companies.</TE>

<HD>Noggin Is Enrolling in Junior High</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Noggin, Nickelodeon and Sesame Workshop's educational cable network
for preschoolers, is extending its reach to "tweens," young people
ages 9 to 14.</LD>
<LD>   Among a host of old and new shows that will fill the new 12-hour
block of programming called "The N," launching today, is an updated
version of the much-lauded 1980s PBS series "Degrassi Junior High,"
which followed the funny and fraught stories of several fictional
students into high school. It will be seen Mondays at 6 and 9 p.m.,
beginning today.</LD>
<LD>   "Degrassi: The Next Generation" returns to middle school. It's the
same mix of youthful soap opera, humor and a careful but frank
approach to real-life challenges facing seventh- and eighth-graders,
updated for an age of cell phones, computers and the Internet.</LD>
<TE>   The opener introduces, among others, high-achieving eighth-grader
Ashley; her boyfriend Jimmy; and her new stepbrother and nemesis,
Toby, a seventh-grader; as well as the mildly wanton Paige; Toby's
comic-minded pal, J.T.; Toby's crush, Emma; and her crush, Sean.
Their stories will be unfolding over 28 episodes.</TE>
<TE>   In the first two installments, Ashley and Toby reach a tentative
truce after a dirty-tricks campaign for student body president;
Ashley and Jimmy decide whether to have sex; and Toby finds that
unrequited love hurts.</TE>
<TE>   Tame compared with "Boston Public" or any number of leering,
teen-focused sitcoms--the language is clean and the young actors
don't look like knowing 24-year-olds--"Degrassi: The Next Generation"
is as direct as the original. In one episode, a Dr. Ruth-style sex
educator uses a banana as a visual aid in a discussion about safe sex
and condom use.</TE>
<TE>   Other new weekly "N" programs, airing 6 p.m to 6 a.m., are
"24Seven," a British drama series set at an international boarding
school; "Being Eve," a comedy about a 15-year-old girl; and new
episodes of Noggin's original "A Walk in Your Shoes," a reality
series in which two kids from different backgrounds briefly switch
places.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the block are Melissa Joan Hart's early Nick hit,
"Clarissa Explains It All"; the "Big Kids" role-reversal comedy
series about parents and kids; the educational "Ghostwriter" and "The
New Ghostwriter Mysteries"; a comedy-improv game show, "Sponk!"; and
"The Adventures of Pete and Pete."</TE>
<TE>   The Noggin programming block, airing 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., ranges from
"Blue's Clues," "Franklin" and other preschooler favorites to the new
"Sesame Street" offshoot, "Play With Me Sesame," with Muppet pals
Ernie, Bert and more.</TE>

<HD>Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young in Peak Form</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Crosby, Stills and Nash minus Neil Young can seem like a
four-cylinder car hitting on just three. But even those who know how
much spark Young can add must have been blown away at the way his
relentless energy turned that 32-year-old vehicle into a rip-roaring
V-8 on Saturday at the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   On a strictly musical level, Young led the quartet--perhaps the
late '60s and early '70s' quintessential conglomeration of socially
relevant hippie musicians--to numerous peaks during a 3 1/2-hour
performance sprinkled with four songs from his forthcoming album,
"Are You Passionate?"</LD>
<LD>   Beyond jacking up the set's freshness, those songs combined with
Young's firebrand stage manner and ferocious electric guitar work to
carry the whole band to a place where, in the aftermath of Sept. 11,
all that once was noble and good about the '60s ethos seemed to be
resurrected, at least for one brief, Camelot-like shining moment.</LD>
<TE>   Talk about your Easter season of miracles.</TE>
<TE>   The new material also lent contextual poignancy to the songs from
the prime of Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash (and sometimes Young) that made up
the bulk of the set.</TE>
<TE>   When they dusted off Joni Mitchell's "Woodstock," her lyrics "We
are stardust/We are golden/And we've got to get ourselves back to the
garden" emerged more as a challenge to the band's fans to reawaken
dormant ideals than the boast of earnest but naive youths who first
sang along more than three decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   Young, David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash got plenty of
power from the backing of organist Booker T. Jones, his MG's bassist
Donald "Duck" Dunn and drummer Steve Potts.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the show, Crosby beamed a beatific, Wilford
Brimley-like smile, Stills played and sang with rare passion, and
Nash lent his sweet, high voice to several songs of his own and to
the always scintillating CSNY harmonic mix.</TE>
<TE>   Rock's answer to the Rat Pack turned in enough transcendent
moments to suggest that maybe the wooden ships weren't just a hippie
dream after all.</TE>

<HD>Why the Whitewashing of Alicia Nash?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA NAVARRETE</AU>
<BD>Lisa Navarrete is deputy vice president in the office
of public information for the National Council of La Raza. She is
based in Washington, D.C.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Halle Berry's historic win eight days ago corrected an unconscionable
failure: In the 74-year history of the Academy Awards, no actress of
color had ever won for leading actress. There are many reasons and
excuses for why this was the case, but clearly one is that for actors
to be Oscar contenders, they have to get important roles in films
that the motion picture academy is likely to recognize and honor.</LD>
<LD>   The mystery is why that opportunity was not given to the Latino
community in the biggest Oscar winner of the night, "A Beautiful
Mind."</LD>
<LD>   In the recent "60 Minutes" interview with Nobel laureate John
Forbes Nash Jr. and his wife, Alicia, on the controversy surrounding
the film version of their lives, questions centered on allegations of
anti-Semitism and his rumored homosexuality. Other questions have
been raised about Nash's past and the film's accuracy.</LD>
<TE>   But one obvious question that hasn't been widely raised about the
film is this: How did Salvadoran-born Alicia Nash, who articulately
defended her husband on "60 Minutes" in accented English, morph into
the decidedly non-Latina character portrayed by actress Jennifer
Connelly?</TE>
<TE>   In the film, there was nothing that indicated that Alicia Nash was
a Latina immigrant, even though it was addressed extensively in the
book on which the movie is based. And clearly the filmmakers cared
enough about veracity to have Russell Crowe substitute his pronounced
Australian accent with a West Virginia one.</TE>
<TE>   This is not to take anything away from Connelly, whose terrific
performance deservedly earned her the Academy Award for best
supporting actress, among other honors. But whether they even
realized they were doing it, director Ron Howard and screenwriter
Akiva Goldsman wasted a golden opportunity to chip away at the
stereotyping of Latinos in Hollywood. This practice has kept our
community invisible and powerless in the industry that controls the
most powerful media in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Today's Hollywood is a place where even the most recognized and
highly paid Latina actor, Jennifer Lopez, will be playing a maid in
her next film. Although many Latinas are maids--an honorable
profession--it is easy for filmgoers and television viewers to think
it is our only line of work. It seems it is the occupation of choice
for Latina characters in films and television.</TE>
<TE>   This is what makes Alicia Nash's whitewashing so depressing. We
could have witnessed the portrayal of a true rarity--a
three-dimensional Latina role model--by a well-known, critically
acclaimed actress. Even better, this could have provided a
career-making opportunity to a Latina actress.</TE>
<TE>   But most of all, this acclaimed movie could have shown the
millions who have seen it that this brilliant, accomplished woman who
was ahead of her time and virtually superhuman in her loyalty and
forbearance, was also a Latina immigrant. It could have shown the
world a side of our community rarely seen on the big screen and
provided millions of young Latinas with a role model worth emulating.</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, Howard and Goldsman owe the Latino community an
explanation, especially given that the subject of Howard's next film
is the battle of the Alamo. Was this change deliberate? Were we
supposed to get from the depiction of Alicia Nash in the film that
she was a Latina immigrant?</TE>
<TE>   Or, perhaps more troubling, did it not even cross their minds what
message they were sending with this omission?</TE>
<TE>   The message back to them has to be clear: This is unacceptable.</TE>

<HD>The Village as a Microcosm of the Wide World</HD>
<DH>A photography installation by Mel Edelman at the California
Museum of Photography relates some telling stories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEAH OLLMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>RIVERSIDE</DL>
<LD>Thornton Wilder gave us Grover's Corners. Sherwood Anderson toured us
through the hearts and minds of Winesburg, Ohio.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Mel Edelman delivers us to his own engrossing sliver of the
world where, as in the towns of Wilder and Anderson, the human
condition plays itself out in microcosm. There are only three
structures--a gallery, a shop and a home--in Edelman's little
village, but each has such physical and emotional credibility that,
together, they create the convincing ambience of a real locale in
real, lived time, a place novelistically infused with secrecy,
obsession, creation, devotion and revelation.</LD>
<LD>   Edelman's marvelously evocative installation occupies the central,
ground floor gallery at UC Riverside's California Museum of
Photography. The three furnished, free-standing buildings deftly fuse
Edelman's material skills as a professional carpenter (in Monterey)
and his acute observational powers as a photographer. The interiors
of the structures are sized to the body, but the exteriors are scaled
down, like the facades on Disneyland's Main Street, minus the
saccharine and kitsch.</LD>
<TE>   Doors to two of the three buildings stand open, and we're invited
not just to wander through but to truly explore each room, to poke
around, open drawers, read papers that have been left out. The house
and the shop feel recently vacated, as if their occupants just
stepped out for lunch or to run an errand. An iron rests on the
ironing board, near a neatly folded shirt. In the shop, the day's
schedule of appointments sits efficiently on the desk, near a pipe
and coffee mug.</TE>
<TE>   Edelman has titled the installation "Things Undone," which neatly
suggests life regarded both in process and in retrospect. The place
feels like a ghost town, yet is permeated by the aura of life,
principally because Edelman himself has left nothing undone. Like a
carefully constructed film set, every detail feeds into the
atmosphere of the whole. The house and shop boast a "time stood
still" decor. Chairs, tables, cabinets and lighting fixtures date to
the '50s or '60s. Whether scraped, yellowed or rusted, the surfaces
bear the patina of age. The palette derives directly from memory.
Immersed in the textures of another time, it's like stepping into a
Coen brothers film: "Barton Fink" or "The Man Who Wasn't There."</TE>
<TE>   But Edelman's installation is not just a technical tour de force.
Intriguing stories and characters emerge, defined by the objects and
the spaces, and ultimately, Edelman has us musing on questions of
psychic survival--our own and that of the fictional occupants of his
town.</TE>
<TE>   Of the three structures, the store is the most dense in detail,
the most captivating. Its windows announce it as a dealership in
confessions and diaries, curiosities and art. This is a business on
the fringe of viability, one that trades on the twin impulses of
secrecy and voyeurism. Enter through the door marked "private" and
find cabinets packed with audiotapes, videotapes and film reels,
printed confessions and diaries (from St. Augustine to Anne Frank),
and an assortment of handwritten journals, old photographs and other
relics. On the desk, a binder contains descriptions of monthly
specials: surveillance tapes from the East German police, military
instructional tapes on interrogation techniques, illicit recordings
from a church confessional. A current of humor runs through this
enterprise, but it's dark, painful, uneasy. It leavens only slightly
the space's heavier notes of vulnerability and exploitation.</TE>
<TE>   One of the cataloged specials is a 1950 journal kept by a Chicago
dishwasher named John Malcolm Bates. It chronicles his efforts to
time-travel by subjecting himself to intense jolts of electricity.
The wreckage of his shock-emitting device is displayed in one of the
shop windows, and a few transcribed pages from his journal hang
framed on the wall. The sales listing in the binder concludes with a
clincher that applies not just to that item, but to Edelman's entire
project: "Fact or fiction," it says, "a riveting read."</TE>
<TE>   In this store, the drive of the obsessive dealer-collector
intersects with a probing of the layered truths of experience and
memory, particularly the desire to know a reality outside the
boundaries of the self. The prurient appeal of another's confessions
and of Bates' time travel experiments stems from that same
fundamental desire. It's also, not coincidentally, one of the primary
allures of photography and film.</TE>
<TE>   The gallery structure that Edelman has included, an archetypal
white box clad in hip corrugated metal, houses an exhibition of
collages, which we view through the locked plate glass doors.
According to the wall text, readable through the doors, the artist
Abraham Goulash, a wealthy land speculator, suffered two debilitating
strokes and lived out his last years parked in front of the
television set, obsessively crafting these primitivist urban
landscapes.</TE>
<TE>   One of the artist's works also hangs in the installation's
clapboard house, which we discover belongs to a psychiatric nurse. A
freshly typed letter (addressed to Edelman) rests on the kitchen
table and describes the nurse's connection to a patient at a New York
mental institution where she worked in the '80s. The patient, one
George Munro, suffered from paranoid delusions and was given myriad
treatments. When deemed well enough to handle some responsibilities
at the facility, he was assigned to engrave identification numbers on
hospital property. The engraving tool became Munro's medium for
making his mark on the world, and he engraved his way through
thousands of objects during his last five years of life at the
hospital, applying tight, meandering maze patterns to metal objects
like the iron, toaster and tea kettle here, as well as inscribing
snippets of text--confessions, really--on ashtrays and water glasses.
Finding Munro's compulsive gestures in unlikely places served as an
awakening of sorts for the nurse living in this simple, slightly
dingy home. She looked at the world differently since then, she
relates in her letter. She started carrying a magnifying glass around
with her.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd never figure a crazy man would bring you closer to God,"
she writes. "But he did."</TE>
<TE>   Munro the engraver, Bates the time-traveler, Goulash the
collagist--each navigates his illness or his delusion using the
rudder of creativity. Art, Edelman so brilliantly reminds us through
the stories of others as much as the work of his own hands, is born
of obsession. It might bring some closer to God. It certainly can
bring us closer to our own lives and awaken us to wonders beyond
ourselves. Art gives us a metaphorical magnifying glass, the better
to see things with. It gives us a town and shows us the world.</TE>

<HD>Two's a Crowd in Story of Bernhardt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Is it possible for a play with only two actors to seem cluttered?</LD>
<LD>   If the play is "Memoir" by John Murrell, which opened Saturday at
the Cassius Carter Centre Stage here, the answer is yes, alas.</LD>
<LD>   The play, directed by Joseph Hardy, brings us the final
lament-filled days of the immortal singer-actress-impresario Sarah
Bernhardt (1844-1923) through a series of witty repartees with her
longtime secretary and manservant, Georges Pitou.</LD>
<TE>   She bedevils him with demands, he fights back slyly with tiny
put-downs. Both have spells of forgetfulness and stubbornness.</TE>
<TE>   The lines doubtless read funny and poignant, but unless you have
an unquenchable interest in the divine Sarah and a high tolerance for
the articulate bickering of oldsters, "Memoir" is likely to be heavy
sledding.</TE>
<TE>   "Memoir" is at its best when, at the beginning of the second act,
Katherine McGrath (Bernhardt) is on stage alone, wondering aloud
about her life and loves, her art and her mortality.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan McMurtry, an Old Globe star for decades, is simply too
strong to play the mousy, henpecked Pitou, and there is never any
clear indication of the nature of the relationship between Sarah and
Pitou.</TE>
<TE>   Is Pitou secretly in love with his libidinous employer? Does he
worship the gifted artist but disdain the impossible egotist? Or is
he just a wimp, too timid to leave a secure paycheck?</TE>
<TE>   "Memoir" doesn't provide much of a clue.</TE>
<TE>   McGrath's Bernhardt is a cross between Auntie Mame and Barbra
Streisand--mega-talented, self-centered, lethally charming when
necessary. She does a cold-cream number on her face that summons up
"Mommy Dearest's" vision of Joan Crawford.</TE>
<TE>   As she rages against the dying of the light, and festers over
slights and feuds that are decades past, Bernhardt mourns the passing
of her free-loving, free-living era.</TE>
<TE>   "We lived exactly as we chose, every moment of our lives," she
says. "We died young, at whatever age. The world may not have been a
better place because we were in it. But it was large--more
interesting--more innocent."</TE>
<TE>   The daughter of a Parisian courtesan, her triumphs and scandals
stretched across decades and continents: the plays of Victor Hugo,
Roxanne in "Cyrano de Bergerac," wildly successful tours, the title
role in "Hamlet," and patriotic service during World War I. And
finally, a tragic accident in South America that cost her a leg but
did not diminish her spirit.</TE>
<TE>   Her will was indomitable and her sex appeal dazzling. Think of her
as the original Madonna, a love-em-and-leave-em material girl before
it was fashionable (and therefore predictable).</TE>
<TE>   In "Memoir," Bernhardt bemoans not having the physical beauty of
other actresses--an opinion disputed by others--and so she had to
work harder than her competitors.</TE>
<TE>   "I had only my eyes," she says. "Everything else I had to create."</TE>
<TE>   With material, and lines, like this, it's doubly disappointing
that "Memoir" fails to grip. A one-woman show perhaps would have been
a better vehicle for capturing the dynanism that was Bernhardt. Pitou
starts as a distraction and deteriorates to a nuisance.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, less is definitely more.</TE>

<HD>Urban Folklore Generates 'The Dazzle'</HD>
<DH>A South Coast Repertory production ponders the passivity
that stymies the cluttered life of two eccentric brothers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1947, the bodies of two brothers, Homer and Langley Collyer, were
excavated from the detritus that had accumulated for decades in their
three-story brownstone on 5th Avenue in Harlem.</LD>
<LD>   In urban folklore, they became the patron saints of packrats--they
died so that their junk might live.</LD>
<LD>   Imagining what the Collyers were like as young adults in the early
20th century, Richard Greenberg wrote "The Dazzle," now at South
Coast Repertory.</LD>
<TE>   To a large extent, the play is about passivity--the clutter kept
piling up, without the brothers doing anything about it.</TE>
<TE>   Passivity isn't an unfamiliar theme on the modern stage ("Waiting
for Godot," anyone?), but it always poses a challenge for a medium
that traditionally depends on action.</TE>
<TE>   "The Dazzle" is an intriguing attempt to meet that challenge,
blessed with Greenberg's customary ear for finely turned phrases from
the mouths of eccentrics. But ultimately it doesn't quite do the job.</TE>
<TE>   As depicted by Greenberg, the culture of the Collyer household is
dictated by the younger brother, Langley (JD Cullum), who is dazzled
by his sensory reactions to whatever crosses his path. He is likely
to fall in love with any new object he touches--although he might
easily forget about it, as fresher objects grab his attention.</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to fully visualize this condition on a stage--when
Langley holds a lacrosse stick, for example, we can't see it closely
enough to spot, let alone appreciate, the details that he finds so
attractive. This wouldn't be as problematic in a movie or even in a
novel, with its opportunities for long descriptions.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Cullum's wide-eyed expressions and his moments of foggy
introspection convey glimmers of his perspective.</TE>
<TE>   Langley occasionally makes money as a pianist, but he tends to
break previously made commitments because of his obsession with newer
phenomena.</TE>
<TE>   Langley's career also is stymied by his inclination to play the
music very slowly, to savor every moment--one aspect of his condition
that we can appreciate in the theater.</TE>
<TE>   For him, performing "The Minute Waltz" in a minute would have been
sacrilegious.</TE>
<TE>   Homer Collyer apparently spent some time working as an attorney.
But by the time the play opens, he's already serving primarily as his
brother's keeper--a role his late mother asked him to perform.</TE>
<TE>   As played by Matt Roth, Homer is no self-effacing wallflower. He's
the more conventionally handsome of the brothers and a master of
acerbic retorts.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike his brother, he worries about the future--which raises the
obvious question, not fully answered: Why does he allow all that junk
to keep growing?</TE>
<TE>   A few lines in the play indicate that Greenberg simply wants us to
accept this as an unexplainable fact of life, but that's easier said
than done.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers aren't quite polar opposites. Although most of the
clutter is Langley's, the stacks of newspapers are Homer's.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Langley, who is too intoxicated with tangible objects and
immediate sounds to spend time reading about things secondhand, Homer
enjoys reading--a dangerous habit in a house like this.</TE>
<TE>   Greenberg introduces a third character, the rebellious socialite
Milly Ashmore (Susannah Schulman), who is attracted to Langley. She
has been to Vienna for psychiatric treatment and probes for the
reasons why Langley is the way he is, without much success. Greenberg
wants the roots of Langley's personality to remain a mystery.</TE>
<TE>   But that doesn't deter Milly from pursuing Langley almost into
marriage--and then, after time passes, from considering a similar
offer from Homer, who is feeling panicky about his wasted life.</TE>
<TE>   In the second act, we learn a dark secret about Milly's past. The
revelation seems oddly incongruous, in light of Greenberg's
unwillingness to fill us in on most of the background of the two
brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Rucker's staging respects the unhurried pacing of the
brothers' life while still managing to build momentum, especially
during the second act.</TE>
<TE>   Darcy Scanlin's set grows as well, suggesting the final height of
the clutter with a back wall display, thereby avoiding blocked sight
lines.</TE>
<TE>   This is the last scheduled show in South Coast's current Second

<DL></DL>
<LD>After the pairs figure skating controversy that threatened to
overwhelm the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, the thought of
simply doing away with the sport's judges is tempting. Wouldn't it be
nice to watch this year's gold medal co-winners perform without the
specter of vote trading?</LD>
<LD>   Tonight's "Shared Gold: Skating Champions Return to the Ice" (8
p.m. NBC) presents Jamie Sale and David Pelletier of Canada and Elena
Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of Russia in just such an
exhibition. No competition, other than perhaps the instinct athletes
naturally possess. No pressure either, other than skating on a
two-hour special on live TV in Canada last month.</LD>
<LD>   NBC's hourlong "Shared Gold" offers some of the routines from that
Canadian broadcast with behind-the-scenes footage of the skaters and
interviews about their feelings during the Olympic judging fiasco.</LD>
<TE>   The special keeps the spotlight mostly on the skating, with
reprisals of the pairs' Salt Lake City programs and some numbers that
let the skaters' personalities emerge even more distinctly--without
Scott Hamilton providing high-pitched commentary.</TE>
<TE>   As one might expect of a show made in North America, Sale and
Pelletier receive the majority of camera time, and their moves are
always smooth. Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze are shown falling a lot in
practice. And yet the Russians' story, especially Berezhnaya's
comeback from a life-threatening injury, is in some ways the more
compelling. Happily, the cheers of a packed stadium in Edmonton, the
city in which Sale and Pelletier trained before the Games, are just
as enthusiastic for both pairs.</TE>

<HD>Regulators Crack Down on Abdominal Stimulators</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Abdominal muscle stimulators may be popular, but legal authorities
aren't enthusiastic about some of the health claims made by
manufacturers of the products.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Trade Commission has cracked down on some of the
devices and, last week, a Napa County Superior Court judge issued a
preliminary injunction halting the advertisement and sale of Gymform
Plus stimulators distributed by Industex USA and two other Industex
corporations.</LD>
<LD>   The device, which costs about $50, is sold over the Internet and
in stores. A ban on the product in California was sought by the
district attorney's offices in Napa and Sonoma counties on grounds
that electrical stimulators can be used only by licensed doctors and
physical therapists and that manufacturers need approval from state
authorities to conduct sales. The stimulators are touted to firm and
tone muscles by passing electrical current through muscles, causing
them to contract.</LD>
<TE>   The injunction only affects Industex, not other manufacturers or
distributors of electrical abdominal stimulators.</TE>
<TE>   However, Daryl Roberts, Napa County's deputy district attorney,
says his office is investigating other companies that sell such
devices in the state.</TE>
<TE>   "We may have to bring more cases," Roberts said. The devices "are
flat-out illegal. Second, the health claims are unsubstantiated and
misleading. Third, the products are misbranded; they don't have the
appropriate warnings on them [that] they are required to have."</TE>
<TE>   Company representatives could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal law, electrical stimulators must be approved by the
Food and Drug Administration to be sold directly to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   However, FDA officials said earlier this year that the agency does
not have the resources to crack down on all offenders and, instead,
will focus its efforts on encouraging manufacturers to seek legal
approval to market their devices.</TE>
<TE>   The injunction on Industex muscle stimulators will hold until the
case is settled or goes to trial, Roberts said.</TE>

<HD>Complementary Therapies Can Help Manage Ailments</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARRIE R. CASSILETH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Complementary therapies do not cure disease, but many reduce or
eliminate symptoms.</LD>
<LD>   They also can help manage some relatively minor but vexing
ailments. Here are five common problems and the complementary
therapies that can treat them safely and effectively.</LD>
<LD>   * Headache. One of humankind's most common ailments, headaches
afflict millions of Americans to the point that many seek medical
relief. But non-chemical complementary remedies are safe, have no
side effects and are sometimes free.</LD>
<TE>   Simple behavioral modifications include adequate sleep, exercise,
a sound diet, better humidity control in your home and stress
management. Complementary therapies that may help ease headache pain
include biofeedback, meditation, yoga, acupuncture, acupressure,
massage, visualization and guided imagery.</TE>
<TE>   Try massage of the back, neck and head for tension or muscle
headaches--or acupuncture or acupressure for persistent headaches.
Yoga classes, readily available, may provide relief of headaches
caused by tension or stress. As for migraines, they rarely succumb to
massage or yoga, but acupuncture may provide good results.</TE>
<TE>   * Pain. Many types of pain can be reduced or banished with
complementary therapies. Pain that originates in muscle or skeletal
problems is most readily treated with those that promote relaxation,
such as music therapy, massage, tai chi, Alexander technique, yoga,
Rolfing, hydrotherapy and hypnosis.</TE>
<TE>   The Alexander technique involves exercises that correct posture
and is often used to reduce pain induced by movement or posture
problems. Tai chi is a gentle but closely controlled exercise, an
ancient technique from traditional Chinese medicine. Rolfing applies
deep pressure to the fascia, the tissues that cover muscles, and
works especially well against pain associated with lower back injury.
Highly diluted volatile mustard oil, used as a paste or mustard
plaster and applied for less than 10 minutes (more can burn), also
can relieve muscle aches.</TE>
<TE>   Sore throat can be eased with slippery elm lozenges or tea.
Specific pain resulting from injury or surgery often can be treated
effectively with acupuncture. Only an experienced, licensed
acupuncturist should be engaged for this treatment, and your doctor
should be consulted.</TE>
<TE>   * Stress. We now know that stress a primary factor in the
development of heart disease and may contribute to chronic pain,
arthritis, diabetes and asthma. So finding ways to reduce or better
manage it is crucial. In complementary therapy, stress treatments
fall primarily in the area of "mind-body medicine." They include
biofeedback, hypnosis, imagery and visualization, meditation and
qigong.</TE>
<TE>   * Depression. Half of all Americans are believed to suffer from
depression at some point in their lives. Even mild depression can sap
energy, damage relationships and take the joy out of life. Many
pharmaceutical antidepressants are available by prescription, but
some are associated with unpleasant side effects. St. John's wort,
also known as hypericum, is a herbal remedy that eases mild and
moderate depression. However, this herb must not be used by people on
other medications, because it interferes with the liver's ability to
properly process many prescription drugs. Meditation, yoga, tai chi,
music and light therapies also help against depression.</TE>
<TE>   Many sufferers have found that an over-the-counter man-made
product, SAM-e, relieves depression effectively. Coated tablets work
best.</TE>
<TE>   * Osteoarthritis. A degenerative joint disease that affects an
estimated 21 million older Americans, osteoarthritis is characterized
by an often painful breakdown of joint cartilage. The cushioning
between bones simply wears away. The disease can affect joints in the
hands, feet, knees and arms.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is as yet no cure, some studies suggest that
glucosamine and chondroitin can reverse some of the effects of the
disease. Glucosamine stimulates the formation and repair of
cartilage, and chondroitin sulfate prevents other body enzymes from
worsening the damage. Although both are found naturally in the body,
supplements are made from animal products and sold without
prescription, typically combined as a single capsule.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous complementary therapies relieve the pain of arthritis.
Pain antidotes mentioned above, such as massage and acupuncture, can
help, as can yoga, tai chi and hydrotherapy. The Arthritis Foundation
says some studies have shown ginger, turmeric and other herbs to be
useful in reducing pain, and the University of North Carolina is
studying a possible link between osteoarthritis and anxiety and
depression.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of your specific illness or condition, tell your doctor
about over-the-counter remedies you want to try, particularly herbal
remedies such as St. John's wort, to make sure you avoid any
potential conflicts. And if you want more information about a
complementary therapy, make sure that the information source is
dependable. Avoid books or Internet sites that promote a specific
remedy.</TE>

<LD>This summer, four lucky young males will spend July and August
whirling around in Northern California with lodgings, food and
entertainment laid on for free.</LD>
<LD>   Or maybe they're not so lucky. Coffee is banned--no!--because it's
too stimulating. Required clothing is the latest in biosensor vest
wear to monitor heart rate and blood pressure. Activities include
providing urine samples, doing mental drills, performing regular
sitting and standing exercises--and spinning inside a big centrifuge
for 22 hours at a time.</LD>
<LD>   Malcolm Cohen, the researcher coordinating these activities, says
the goal is not fun, fun, fun but to better understand the effects of
gravity on human biology and to test how we adjust to living at
higher-than-normal gravitational forces. The studies might, for
instance, suggest ways to help astronauts adjust to Earth after
stints in space.</LD>
<TE>   In Cohen's study, four stalwart lads will climb into the
58-foot-long centrifuge at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain
View and spend a total of 188 hours lounging around, sleeping, eating
and watching videos while the centrifuge's spinning creates forces of
up to 2G--twice the Earth's normal gravitational pull. Endurance will
be tested in various ways and compared with endurance at the start of
the test.</TE>
<TE>   Many things happen when the body is subjected to extra gravity,
says Cohen, a NASA and Stanford University scientist. Fluid, for
instance, tends to pool in lower parts of the body, making for
thicker legs and (more important) a harder job supplying the brain
with blood.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen wants to know if people adjust to this over time, rendering
their bodies better able to deal with higher G forces.</TE>
<TE>   Even more would happen if the men were to spin around for weeks
and months instead of merely a day at a time. Their sleep would get
messed up because, under heightened gravity, the body's inner clock
starts running more slowly, says Charles Fuller, a scientist at UC
Davis. (Fuller heads the university's "chronic acceleration research
unit," where chickens and mice and other critters go on long-term
tilt-a-whirl rides.)</TE>
<TE>   And bodies would change shape too. Muscles and bones respond to
that extra gravitational yanking by getting thicker and stronger. In
a classic experiment in the 1970s, chickens living in a centrifuge
for 23 generations at even higher G forces than those planned for
Cohen's subjects emerged beefier, bonier and leaner than poultry at
the start of the ride.</TE>
<TE>   Tabloid papers got pretty excited about that fat-loss finding,
says Fuller, but it's a lousy way to get svelte. "When you stop, the
body puts the fat back on again," he says. You'd have to live in a
centrifuge indefinitely. Weightlessness also brings about a mess of
body changes. We learned about them from Ronald White, associate
director of the National Space Biomedical Research Institute in
Houston. Many of the changes are similar to what happens if someone
has to rest in bed for a long time. (Consequently, a lot of NASA
experiments have involved people lying in bed.)</TE>
<TE>   Here's a sampling of weightlessness changes:</TE>
<TE>   * Without sensing gravity, astronauts find it hard to know what's
up and what's down--causing space sickness and illusions of suddenly
flipping upside down. This passes within days.</TE>
<TE>   * Fluid moves upward in the body, fading wrinkles and narrowing
ankles (yay!) but also creating a moon-shaped face and bulging neck
veins. (Not so good.)</TE>
<TE>   * This shift in fluid makes the body decide it's got too much
liquid in it. Kidneys start working overtime excreting water.
Astronauts stop drinking as much.</TE>
<TE>   * The shift of fluid to the chest and head causes nasal and sinus
congestion--and a case of "space sniffles."</TE>
<TE>   * Sense of taste changes too. "Many space travelers say that foods
don't taste the same," White says. "They also say they start liking
spicy food the best." Scientist aren't sure why.</TE>
<TE>   * The chest expands because it's not weighed down any more by the
heart and other organs in the body cavity.</TE>
<TE>   * The heart, arteries and veins get lazy because they don't have
to work so hard getting blood to the upper part of the body. When
astronauts come down, they can get dizzy, even faint, should they get
up suddenly.</TE>
<TE>   * Longer term, bones get thin and muscle wastes--especially the
muscle fibers used to keep the body standing upright against the
force of gravity. Body fat increases.... I'll stay home.</TE>

<HD>One Side Effect of Botox: An Excruciating Headache</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANNE PARTIE LANGE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Botox is remarkably safe, especially considering it's a powerful
toxin. Occasionally, a mild headache that lasts a few hours may occur
after an injection in muscles of the forehead. Very rarely, though,
that headache may become excruciating and can last as long as a
month. While only about 1% of 320 Botox users in a recent study
experienced the more severe side effect, more reports may surface
after physicians learn about it from reports published in the Journal
of the American Academy of Dermatology.</LD>
<LD>   "What was surprising was how long the headache lasted and that
nothing seemed to give much relief," says Kenneth A. Arndt, clinical
professor of dermatology at Harvard Medical School and a co-author of
the study. He says no one knows why Botox, which can effectively
treat migraines in some people, would actually cause headaches. "It
may be because of a disequilibrium in the muscles," Arndt says. "Some
muscles are relaxed and others tighten."</LD>
<TE>   He doesn't think the severe headache after Botox injection is a
coincidence but says that further studies are needed to confirm the
link and investigate the possibility of a placebo effect. If a severe
headache does occur after an injection, Arndt suggests not having
Botox again. For those who don't want their frown lines to reappear,
he says Myobloc, which is botulinum toxin type B, is worth a try.
(Botox is botulinum toxin type A.) "The person can be injected with a
few drops [of type B] and see if the same thing happens," he says.

<TE>   Muscle Building Burns Calories Only to a Certain Extent</TE>
<TE>   Build muscles and burn more calories even while you sleep. That
common belief is not exactly a fitness lie. Let's just call it a
misinterpretation.</TE>
<TE>   A recent study showed resistance or strength training builds
muscle, which increases resting metabolic rate, so more calories are
burned after you stop exercising, but that effect doesn't last longer
than about 72 hours. The only way to burn more calories is to keep
exercising, said the author of the recently published study.</TE>
<TE>   After six months of working out regularly with a personal trainer,
women in a resistance training group increased their fat-free
mass--that includes muscle--and their resting metabolic rate, but
there was no change in the total calories burned in the days
following the end of the study. "The total calories used each day
increases a little but it's short-lived. It lasts about 48 to 72
hours," says Eric T. Poehlman, a professor of nutrition and medicine
at the University of Montreal. If you want to burn more calories than
you do in your usual daily activities, he says, "you've got to keep
exercising. There is no carry-over."</TE>
<TE>   Those in the endurance-trained group who did aerobic exercise with
a trainer increased their lung capacity, but they had no change in
their fat-free mass or the number of calories burned doing their
treadmill workout or in the days afterward. (The Journal of Clinical
Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism 87 [3]; 1,004-1,009.)</TE>
<TE>   Folate May Benefit People at Risk for Colon Cancer</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing you can do to alter the genetic cards you're dealt
at birth, but evidence is mounting that you can modify the risk
dictated by those genes.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, for instance, researchers found that consuming more
folate and less alcohol significantly lessens the chances that a
person with a family history of colon cancer will get the disease. A
person whose parent or sibling has colon cancer has twice the risk of
developing it. That increased risk can be virtually eliminated,
researchers found, by taking a multivitamin with 400 micrograms of
folic acid (folate) and drinking no more than a glass or two of wine
a day.</TE>
<TE>   They came to this conclusion after studying the diet, supplement
use and drinking habits of nearly 90,000 women for 16 years. The
women were participating in the Nurses' Health Study, a group of
121,700 female nurses whose health and habits have been followed by
researchers for 25 years. The researchers also report in the journal
Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention that high levels of
folate and methionine, an amino acid, and low levels of alcohol had
only a small effect on colon cancer risk in women with no family
history.</TE>
<TE>   Fruits, vegetables and products made with enriched flour are good
sources of folate. Dr. Charles S. Fuchs, of the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute in Boston, said it's easiest to be sure you're getting
enough folate by taking a daily multivitamin, which is what many of
the nurses in the study did. (Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp;
Prevention Mar; 11 [3], pp 227-234.)</TE>
<TE>   Research Links Nausea to Anxiety and Depression</TE>
<TE>   When a queasy stomach can't be traced to something you ate or the
flu, think about what's going on in your head. People who suffer from
anxiety or depression frequently have gastrointestinal complaints,
particularly nausea, according to a new study. Earlier studies show
most people seeing specialists for gastrointestinal disorders have
anxiety and depression. However, researchers didn't know how
prevalent the link was in the general population.</TE>
<TE>   To find out, they surveyed more than 60,000 adults living in
Norway about symptoms such as nausea, heartburn, diarrhea and
constipation. A test for anxiety and depression was also conducted.
The Norwegian team concluded that anxiety was the strongest risk
factor for mild to major nausea. Four out of 10 people who had major
complaints of nausea had anxiety. About one in four had depression.
Of course, some of the people who had anxiety and depression may have
also had physical conditions, such as angina or cancer, which could
cause nausea. But the researchers say these health problems couldn't
account for all of the nausea reported.</TE>
<TE>   "This study announces to doctors that when a person comes in with
stomach distress, at least stress and anxiety ought to be considered
before doing a lot of tests," says Don R. Lipsitt, editor of General
Hospital Psychiatry and professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical
School. (General Hospital Psychiatry 24 [2002]; pages 81-86.)</TE>
<TE>   Glycemic Index Charted for Fitness Drinks, Snacks</TE>
<TE>   By now, if you don't know all carbohydrates are not alike, you've
either been living far from the Zone diet or you don't have a weight
problem. Glycemic index, buzzwords for how quickly glucose from a
carbohydrate gets into your blood, is being bandied about like fat
grams.</TE>
<TE>   Dieters are urged to avoid too many carbohydrates, especially
those with a high glycemic index because they send blood sugar levels
soaring. That sets off a series of reactions that contribute to
weight gain and diabetes. The glycemic index of hundreds of foods has
been charted, but until now, sports drinks and energy bars haven't
been analyzed. The results of a study that involved more than 1,000
finger sticks to test the blood sugar levels of five volunteers were
published in March in the Journal of the American Dietetic Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Glucose, the sugar that results from the breakdown of starches and
circulates in the blood, is the standard by which the bars and drinks
were measured, says Randall J. Gretebeck, a Wayne State University
dietitian and exercise physiologist. The glycemic index of glucose is
100, marking the top of the list.</TE>
<TE>   Neck and neck with glucose was a Cookies &amp; Cream Cliff Bar. A bar
with a high glycemic index is not a bad thing after a vigorous
spinning class or an arduous uphill hike. After a long and strenuous
workout, there's a two-hour window of opportunity when muscles refuel
more quickly, Gretebeck said. But a food with that high an index
isn't the healthiest afternoon snack if you've been sitting at your
computer all day and haven't used your stored energy.</TE>
<TE>   Orange Allsport sport drink and vanilla Boost meal replacements
were lowest on the glycemic index list. The Met-Rx bar was the lowest
of the energy bars. "Some people believe lower glycemic index foods
are best before an endurance activity because they raise the blood
sugar more slowly before beginning exercise and keep it more steady,"
Gretebeck says.</TE>

<HD>When a Privilege Yields to Age</HD>
<DH>When the elderly can no longer drive, family members must
deal with the transition too. Offering alternatives may calm fears of
being cut off.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of all the insults of growing older, losing one's driving privileges
can be one of the most difficult to bear. A new driver's license is a
symbolic rite of passage from youth into adulthood, but giving up the
car keys as physical and mental faculties diminish is a passage of
another sort.</LD>
<LD>   "Driving is the ultimate symbol of independence and
self-reliance," said Gloria E. Gesas, a clinical social worker with
Jewish Family Service of Los Angeles. Older adults often feel that
their life is essentially over without a car, she said. And they may
stubbornly resist relying on their children or others for
transportation. For families of an elderly driver, the issue is
emotionally charged, one that can drive a wedge between husband and
wife, parent and child. Family members, often the first to observe an
older adult's diminished driving abilities, don't want to feel
responsible for curtailing a loved one's independence--the ability to
drive to the grocery store, to religious services or to pick up a
grandchild after school. The need for mobility is especially acute in
regions such as Southern California, where urban sprawl, inadequate
mass transit and access to commerce, culture and social activities
make automobile transportation a near-necessity.</LD>
<TE>   Though there is little debate about when people are ready to start
driving--age 16 in most states--there is no consensus or standard age
for relinquishing the privilege.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing that just keeps coming through loud and clear is how
different seniors are from each other," said Arline Dillman, traffic
safety manager for the Automobile Club of Southern California. "I
know some people in their 90s who are still marvelous drivers, and
some in their 50s and 60s--or for that matter in their 30s and
40s--who ought not to be driving."</TE>
<TE>   One thing's certain: More older drivers will be on the road as the
nation's population ages. In 1990, older drivers accounted for 6.7%
of all travel on U.S. roads, but that figure will increase nearly
threefold by 2030, when they'll account for about 19%, according to
federal estimates. The responsibility for the safety of older drivers
is shared by many people, including family, doctors and the
government.</TE>
<TE>   Often, changes in someone's physical or mental health condition
will prompt discussion about whether an older driver is still fit to
be behind the wheel.</TE>
<TE>   Glaucoma, cataracts, diabetic changes in the eye or macular
degeneration may impair the ability to read signs or gauge distances.
Arthritis, for example, may make it impossible to turn the head to
drive in reverse, or maneuver the foot from brake to accelerator.
Certain prescription drugs, such as high blood pressure medications,
can create drowsiness and slow reaction time. Although dementia alone
doesn't preclude driving, those people with moderate to severe
dementia lack insight into their behavior and may make poor
judgments.</TE>
<TE>   Although relatives are in a position to make valuable observations
about an older driver, they often resist confronting the issue of a
loved one's deteriorating skills because they fear the consequences.
They may worry that a spouse or parent will stop talking to them or
become deeply depressed if they broach the subject. Another factor is
the guilt and resentment of realizing they may have to become the
primary driver, said Gesas, who counsels families on how to handle
situations involving an older person's loss of driving privileges.
She guides them to transportation services, in-home help and mental
health support.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes an accident--or series of accidents--or other troubling
event, such as a driver getting lost, will force a family into
action.</TE>
<TE>   Esty LaHive's first inkling that her husband, Joseph, was losing
his driving abilities came in August 1997, when he took the car and
disappeared for hours, missing their anniversary celebration, and
then couldn't account for his time. Then another incident: After
leaving the couple's Studio City home one morning and failing to show
up for a golf game, he called hours later from a shopping mall in
Calabasas. He couldn't find his car, he told his wife. A Sheriff's
Department helicopter eventually located the badly damaged car in a
ditch several miles away.</TE>
<TE>   After that incident, Joseph LaHive, now 80 and living in a nursing
home with dementia, still wanted to drive and his wife sometimes
allowed him to borrow her car. She eventually removed the car key
from his key ring.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, a neurologist diagnosed Joseph with dementia and filed a
report with the DMV. Months later, the agency informed him he'd have
to take a written test. After he had trouble concentrating on the
study guide at home, Esty decided against having him take the written
test, hoping to spare him the indignity of failing.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very traumatic for him,'' Esty said. "He didn't want to
give up driving."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes a professional assessment is the best way to determine
someone's driving fitness, said Dr. Richard A. Marottoli, a
geriatrician at the VA Connecticut Health Care System in West Haven.
The assessments, often done by an occupational therapist and costing
about $500, are usually covered by health insurance if related to
traumatic injury or stroke. They often are not covered if the
patient's diagnosis is dementia, Marottoli said. In some cases, it
may pay for the driver to brush up skills with on-road training or a
course sponsored by such organizations as AARP.</TE>
<TE>   When a decision is being made to have someone stop driving, family
members should try to reach consensus and form a united front, Gesas
said. If there is disagreement among the family about the best course
of action, a social worker or counselor can help by discussing safety
versus autonomy issues.</TE>
<TE>   They also need to decide how best to break the news to the older
driver. They may try loving appeals to the person's sense of safety,
saying: "We care about you, and you're not safe anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, however, reason doesn't work, especially when the older
driver shuts them out or can't listen because of dementia. In such
cases, family members may try deceptions, such as saying the car is
being repaired. They may resort to canceling car insurance, hiding
the keys or disabling the car. But these actions often enrage the
driver and can potentially damage family bonds. Social workers can
ease the transition by arranging access to alternative
transportation, grocery delivery, home meal preparation and other
services so the person doesn't become cut off from friends and peers.</TE>
<TE>   Another way that children or spouses seek help is through the
family doctor. A 1997 study by the New York State Office for the
Aging found that more than 70% of families struggling with this issue
of an elderly driver's competence said getting the doctor involved
was helpful.</TE>
<TE>   That's what happened in the case of a 77-year-old San Fernando
woman who suffers from short-term memory loss and dementia. Her
81-year-old husband sought the advice of a doctor, who said it wasn't
safe for her to continue driving.</TE>
<TE>   The doctor sent a report to the California Department of Motor
Vehicles. (California is the only state that requires doctors to
report a diagnosis of dementia to county health authorities, who then
forward it to the DMV.) The state revoked the woman's driver's
license two weeks ago. Now she's frustrated and angry.</TE>
<TE>   "When she got that letter, she virtually ripped it up and said she
was going to drive anyway," said the husband, a retired civil
engineer who asked that his and his wife's names not be published.</TE>
<TE>   He tried convincing his wife the decision was for her own health
and safety. But she said it was making her a prisoner at home.
Although "willing to do all I can," he said the strain of caring for
her and doing all the driving for both of them is taking a toll on
his health.</TE>
<TE>   Although his wife's doctor followed the law and sent a report to
state authorities, most doctors don't note the diagnosis of dementia
in the patient's medical record because they don't want to assume the
resulting legal responsibility, said Dr. Alison Moore, a UCLA
geriatrician. In some cases, primary care or family doctors may be
concerned that their relationship with the patient may suffer if that
person holds them responsible for the loss of driving privileges.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, though, doctors can't revoke anyone's driver's license.
That's the responsibility of the DMV.</TE>
<TE>   In California, anyone may file a report with the DMV about a
suspected unsafe driver. The DMV may conduct an evaluation that
includes vision testing, an interview and a driving test; the agency
is developing new tests to better screen existing drivers for
physical and mental declines that could impair driving. It can revoke
a license or issue a provisional license that limits someone to
driving during the day, a certain geographic area or only on surface
streets. It can call the driver back for additional tests at a later
time.</TE>
<TE>   Many doctors worry, however, that taking away the patient's
ability to drive can lead to an inexorable decline.</TE>
<TE>   Yale's Marottoli cited a study that found that seniors who stopped
driving were less active and more depressed. Marottoli said is it
crucial to provide transportation alternatives for seniors and to
keep them engaged in the world around them.</TE>
<TE>   In some situations, it's not necessary to take away a driver's key
entirely. Temporary steps can be taken that help preserve an older
drivers' dignity and mobility, while keeping them out of unsafe
situations.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say these steps often work best if they are voluntary, or
adopted with support from family and friends. And many seniors
voluntarily limit their driving to situations in which they feel
safer.</TE>
<TE>   Esther Joffe, 90, of North Hollywood, hasn't driven after dark
since she turned 85.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not drive after dark because I am not positive about my
vision, although it's OK," said Joffe, who underwent successful
cataract surgery but still sticks to daytime driving. "I think
discretion was the better part of valor here," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Joffe, who hopes to continue driving "as long as I live," travels
to yoga classes, doctors' appointments and the supermarket--avoiding
the freeway. She and a friend take turns driving to the local movie
theater and, for longer trips, sometimes take the bus and Metro Rail.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a feeling of liberation and independence when you have a
car,'' she said. "You go when you want, where you what, and that's
important.''</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Signs of Declining Driving Skills</TE>
<TE>   When evaluating the performance of an older driver, bear in mind
that the safety of many other people--including passengers,
pedestrians and other drivers--is at stake.</TE>
<TE>   Some warning signs that driving skills may be impaired:</TE>
<TE>   Failure to stay in proper lane when making a turn.</TE>
<TE>   Getting lost frequently.</TE>
<TE>   Ignoring traffic signs or signals.</TE>
<TE>   Failing to yield the right-of-way.</TE>
<TE>   Turning left from the wrong lane.</TE>
<TE>   Driving slower than the posted speed limit.</TE>
<TE>   Inattention to other vehicles, pedestrians and bikers.</TE>
<TE>   Not checking blind spots when driving in reverse--sometimes a sign
of physical limitations, such as neck problems.</TE>
<TE>   Difficulty parking.</TE>
<TE>   Confusing the brake and gas pedals.</TE>

<HD>Break the Nonstop Noshing With Mindful Eating</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLY SQUIRES</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans eat while walking down the street, snack in front of the
television, grab a bite in the car, gobble food at their desks and
munch midnight snacks while lying in bed.</LD>
<LD>   Is it any wonder that this nonstop noshing is helping to expand
waistlines nationwide?</LD>
<LD>   '"People say, 'I can't understand why I gain weight because I
hardly eat anything,'" says Marvin H. Berenson, clinical professor of
psychiatry and behavioral sciences at USC's School of Medicine. "But
if they look at what they are eating, they will find that they are
eating a lot more than they think they are."</LD>
<TE>   For this reason, we should all try to engage in "mindful eating"
at least once a day. There's no rocket science here. It begins with
paying attention to portion sizes and "being mindful not just about
food but also about your body," says Debora Burgard, a psychologist
in Los Altos, Calif. "It means being aware of when you are hungry and
of your stomach as it is actually becoming satisfied so that you know
how to make a decision about when to stop eating."</TE>
<TE>   Think a little mindless eating--a cookie here, a slice of cake at
the office, a handful of candies--can't add too much? Think again.
Studies show that the typical overweight American underestimates
daily caloric intake by up to 40%. On a 2,000-calorie diet, a typical
amount recommended for many adults by the U.S. Dietary Guidelines,
that works out to an extra 800 calories a day and adds up 5,600
calories a week, or about enough to pile on almost a pound per week.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what experts recommend:</TE>
<TE>   * Rev up before coming to the table. That's right, instead of
rushing to eat, do one to three minutes of brief exercise just before
sitting down to the table. "Do anything at all," says Berenson,
author of "The Five Keys to Permanent Weight Control" ($16.95; 2002).
"Take a little walk, swing your arms, go up and down the steps." Just
a minute or two of exercise, he says, "increases blood flow to the
muscles, away from the stomach, and actually decreases appetite."
Yes, it's only temporary, but it's a way to ease into eating.</TE>
<TE>   * Savor the flavor. Take the time to enjoy food. Focus on what is
being consumed. Guilt--especially about eating so-called "bad"
foods--fuels a lot of fast overeating. "Instead of sitting down and
saying, 'I'm going to have two chocolate chip cookies and really
enjoy them,' people often eat 10 cookies quickly, don't taste the
stuff and wind up being full and unsatisfied," says Tracy Sbrocco, a
psychologist and weight-control researcher at the Uniformed Services
University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md.</TE>
<TE>   * Chewing counts. Yes, Mom was right when she said to chew slowly,
but no, you don't have to chew everything 30 times. "Chew more
slowly, count the number of bites and if you find you chew three
times, then increase it to five times," Berenson says. The point, he
notes, is to slow down.</TE>
<TE>   * Establish no-eat zones. In other words, eat at the kitchen or
the dining table, but not throughout the house and especially not
while watching television. Same thing goes for establishing no-eat
zones at the office and in the car.</TE>
<TE>   * Examine why you eat. The obvious question: Are you really hungry
or eating for some other reason? "People eat out of habit," Sbrocco
says. "They eat out of emotions. They eat out of boredom because they
are trapped in their car.... People eat because they are stressed,
anxious or feeling out of control. By doing this mindless eating,
they keep their emotions at bay." And, unthinkingly, add unwanted
pounds.</TE>
<TE>   * Take a seventh-inning stretch. Postpone second helpings until at
least 10 minutes after finishing the first to enable your brain to
catch up with the satiety signals from your stomach. Dish out single
servings and keep platters in the kitchen rather than on the table,
where they provide temptation. "People will just finish what is on
their plates or in front of them without waiting for the internal
cues to catch up," Sbrocco says. Be especially careful at
restaurants, where serving sizes are often large.</TE>
<TE>   * Water liberally during--and in between--meals. Sip water between
bites even if you're only snacking. It helps increase satiety and
slows consumption. "Anything that slows up eating is apt to decrease
calories," Berenson says. Another tip: Put utensils down between
mouthfuls.</TE>
<TE>   * Engage in guided eating. "Before putting a spoonful of food in
your mouth, imagine the food, imagine filling up your mouth and then
your stomach," Berenson says. "The next bite you take will be much
smaller. It becomes a psychological game."</TE>

<HD>Ergonomics May Help Take the Ache Out</HD>

<LD>We all know we should check our posture at our keyboards and take
frequent breaks, but as the hours go by, gravity pulls us into a
slump and the mouse pad tends to slide farther from our reach.</LD>
<LD>   To help keep us in our proper places there are all sorts of pads,
supports, cushions, even a mouse designed to nestle cozily into the
palm. With all these ergonomic choices, one wonders whether anything
really works.</LD>
<LD>   Now, researchers have found that with training, three basic
devices do work, reducing workers' complaints by 40% on average after
seven to eight months of use. Nearly half the 365 workers studied had
fewer back and elbow problems than they did before their workstations
were altered.</LD>
<TE>   The team of ergonomic experts, led by Alan Hedge, director of the
Human Factors and Ergonomics Laboratory at Cornell University in
Ithaca, N.Y., trained New Jersey office workers to use a negative
slope keyboard tray, which is a keyboard platform that tilts downward
toward the floor with an upper mouse platform that swings 1 to 2
inches over the numeric keypad on the keyboard. The workers also used
an ergonomic chair that had adjustments for chair height, lumbar
support height, back rest, seat tilt, seat depth and arm rest.</TE>
<TE>   In a recently published report, the researchers said that before
the training began, 84% of those surveyed had some musculoskeletal
complaint. Only 6.4% of the participants did not find the ergonomics
training helpful.</TE>
<TE>   More information about the study is available at the lab's
Internet site: ergo.human.cornell.edu.</TE>

<LD>"Move like Nia dancers," our teacher, Sarah Lampro, exhorted us, and
we did--even though some of us had no idea what that meant.</LD>
<LD>   I had come to the weekday morning class not knowing what to
expect. A colleague who had tried a sample Nia session in Pasadena
had told me that it was weird and fun.</LD>
<LD>   The Web site had described the practice in vague, nebulous
language: "The Nia technique combines the intelligence and creativity
from the East and West, Yin and Yang, Mind, Body Spirit and Soul."</LD>
<TE>   It had sounded so deliciously hokey--so totally California--I had
to try it.</TE>
<TE>   The class I chose, at Pacific Athletic Club, was held in a room
full of mirrors. The music ranged from pop to world music, and the
moves alternated between expressive bouts of "free dance" and
segments of instructor-led calisthenics.</TE>
<TE>   Nia, I learned, borrows from a variety of disciplines, including
yoga, aerobics, martial arts, kick-boxing and dance.</TE>
<TE>   Like striving Merce Cunningham wannabes, neophyte ninjas or
tentative tribal dancers, we felt the rhythm of the tabla through our
bare feet, and swayed our bodies to the twang of the sitar.</TE>
<TE>   Created nearly 20 years ago by Debbie and Carlos Rosas as a
response to the high-impact aerobics boom, Nia was designed to be
more "mindful" and gentler on the body.</TE>
<TE>   In their quest to find an exercise that would cause fewer
injuries, the Rosases studied aerobics, martial arts, yoga and dance.</TE>
<TE>   They skimmed and refined what they judged to be the best of each;
they took out bounce and added flow. The result was Nia. "Nia" means
"purpose" in Swahili. It was also originally an acronym for
"non-impact aerobics"; today it stands for "neuromuscular integrative
action," a term the Rosases coined to describe the link between mind
and body.</TE>
<TE>   As in martial arts, instructors earn belts ranging from white
(lowest) to black (highest). Students progress from one belt to the
next by completing successive training courses. Manuals define skills
required for each belt level.</TE>
<TE>   There are nearly 1,000 Nia instructors worldwide and nearly 600 in
the United States, according to Kevin Bradley, marketing director at
Nia headquarters in Portland, Ore. Bradley estimates that 15,000
people practice Nia daily.</TE>
<TE>   Most Nia classes can be found in health clubs, but there are
entire studios devoted completely to the practice in cities such as
Austin, Texas, and Washington, D.C. The largest Nia communities are
in New York, Portland, Boulder, Colo., and Austin, Bradley said.</TE>
<TE>   But Nia is barely a blip on the exercise scene here in Los
Angeles. Bradley said he is in the midst of a campaign to promote Nia
in the Southland.</TE>
<TE>   "It is kind of crazy that L.A. hasn't caught on," said Lampro, who
has taught Nia in Palos Verdes, Pacific Palisades, Manhattan Beach
and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   It is crazy. With its touchy-feely new-age lingo, verbal patter of
self-acceptance, elements of watered-down yoga and corporatist
flower-child flavor, Nia seems a perfect fit for Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   On this morning, about a dozen homemakers, retirees and free
spirits--ranging in age from late 20s to 60s--gathered to dance. We
stood obediently in lines, waiting for class to begin.</TE>
<TE>   Lampro, our teacher, had bright, lively eyes, a playful
personality, a perfectly toned body and a red bandana tied around her
head.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no rules," Lampro told us as the music began. "There is
no right or wrong. This is a dance party!"</TE>
<TE>   The day's theme, she told us, was "Girls' Night Out." I learned
later that the Rosases have choreographed nearly 40 set routines,
each drawing on different forms of exercise. Some routines are
predominantly based on tai chi, others on aikido, still others on
tribal dancing.</TE>
<TE>   We began with free dancing to warm up. Some of us were awkward at
first, but soon we were skipping, grooving and giggling.</TE>
<TE>   "Dance like a snake flows through your spine," Lampro told us, as
she undulated like a belly dancer. She threw her arms out like a
surfacing mermaid. "Splash emotion," she said. "Splash sound."</TE>
<TE>   Nia felt like a hodgepodge of every exercise class I had ever
taken. It was like a rave without Ecstasy. Yoga without postures.
Aikido without the philosophy. Spirituality without God.</TE>
<TE>   We did step routines like those in aerobics, and kicks like those
in Tae-Bo or kick-boxing. We did breathing exercises as in Kundalini
yoga and dancing that seemed derived from the dance theories of
new-age guru Gabrielle Roth.</TE>
<TE>   What was distinctive about the class was the language. Whether we
were doing hard-core leg lifts or gentle shoulder circles, Lampro's
instructions sounded like a Zen koan--or a bad knockoff of a Rumi
poem.</TE>
<TE>   Lampro used words and phrases I had never heard in an exercise
class. "Melt" described one move. "Open your heart" described
another. "Happy bodies. Happy bodies," was the call for a familiar
bit of aerobics choreography, with some flowing arm movements thrown
in.</TE>
<TE>   Lampro herself was like a stream of positive energy unleashed on
the room. She skipped among us, tripping the light fantastic.  The
class was fun. If you sneak a peek during a yoga or martial-arts
class, you generally see grimaces of intensity, focus and pain. Here,
people were laughing--even hooting with joy. At one point I heard a
hoot from my own mouth.</TE>
<TE>   After class no one looked dog-tired or beaten to death. We looked
happy. Though it felt more like play than a workout, my heart rate
monitor told me my average heart rate was 118, with a high of 148. I
had burned 257 calories, more than my typical three-mile run or 20
minutes on the stair machine.</TE>
<TE>   But beyond calories, I had gone somewhere I rarely go during
exercise, or even daily life.</TE>
<TE>   I don't throw my arms out for joy when I see the sunshine or skip
around when I hear beautiful music or smile openly at someone I don't
know when we both witness something life-affirming.</TE>
<TE>   The Nia class made me do that, and it felt great.</TE>
<TE>   Talking with some of the more hard-core Nia dancers after class, I
realized my reaction was downright mild. "I come because it is good
for my soul," said Marge Gold, 62, who lives in Pacific Palisades and
has been doing Nia for more than a year. "I come because it's fun. It
makes you feel childlike."</TE>
<TE>   Gold, a diminutive woman with a gray, pixie hairstyle, said she
began taking the class after she made a New Year's resolution last
year to feel more comfortable with her body.</TE>
<TE>   "It has taken a year and a half to where I can get out there and
not feel stupid," she said. "It has allowed me to not feel so
self-conscious."</TE>
<TE>   Lydia Smith, 37, of Topanga Canyon, said she delights in the
female-bonding vibe of the class. (Men occasionally drop in, but it's
a novelty, participants said.) She said she always leaves in a better
mood.</TE>
<TE>   I left the class wondering if I might burst into song in the
supermarket line, or throw my arms out for joy when I saw the ocean.
It would be hokey. But maybe that would be a good thing.</TE>

<HD>Eyeing a Potential Conflict</HD>
<DH>Lasik* Optometrists often have agreements that reimburse
them for referring patients to ophthalmologists for laser surgery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA MARSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Millions of Americans have had laser-eye surgery and many of those
patients have relied on their optometrist for information or
referrals to eye surgeons who perform the popular procedure. Many
optometrists have signs or brochures about Lasik surgery prominently
posted in their offices.</LD>
<LD>   But what many consumers don't know is that their optometrists'
referrals may be influenced by controversial financial arrangements
known as "co-management" deals, in which the optometrist receives a
portion of the Lasik surgery fee in exchange for referring patients
to a particular eye doctor or group of eye doctors.</LD>
<LD>   Under these arrangements, optometrists often will perform some
screening exams before the surgery and provide care after surgery.
While co-management arrangements are legal, some critics of the
practice say they can create conflicts of interest that might harm
patients.</LD>
<TE>   Some doctors are concerned that co-managing arrangements create an
environment in which money can cloud professional judgment. "When you
put a price tag on someone's head, objectivity becomes limited," said
Dr. Samuel Masket, a clinical professor of ophthalmology at UCLA.
Many optometrists used to be adamantly opposed to refractive surgery,
mostly because they lost business when some patients no longer needed
glasses. Once optometrists found a way to profit from the Lasik boom,
"then they became very proactive," Masket said.</TE>
<TE>   Optometrists see the situation through a different lens. Though
they acknowledge that the practice has a potential for abuse, they
believe co-management can benefit patients. Optometrists know their
patients' visual needs, they say, and if they need temporary glasses
or contacts after Lasik surgery, they can prescribe them. "Who is
better qualified to follow these patients than someone who has known
them for years?" asks Joseph P. Shovlin, a Scranton, Pa., optometrist
and spokesman for the American Academy of Optometry in Rockville, Md.
"To a certain extent, this is just a turf battle between
optometrists, who want to keep their patients, and some of the
ophthalmologists."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, this controversy reflects an ongoing struggle between the
two professions as to whom is best-suited to administer care.
Optometrists, who attend four years of school after college but are
not medical doctors, can prescribe medication and treat infections.
But ophthalmologists, who undergo several years of training after
medical school, have long argued that they are better qualified to
provide certain services.</TE>
<TE>   In February 2000, in fact, the American Academy of Ophthalmology
and the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery jointly
issued guidelines for co-management agreements to their members. The
guidelines state that the practice should only be done in special
circumstances--if the patient lives far away from the surgeon, or if
the doctor is unavailable because of illness or is out of town.
Co-management deals should not be routine, the groups concluded, and
any fees paid should reflect fair market value for the services
performed. "The best interests of the patient must come first," says
Dr. I. Howard Fine, an ophthalmologist in Eugene, Ore., and president
of the ASCRS. "We should not be self-serving."</TE>
<TE>   Still, eye doctors acknowledge that financial incentives--and not
just expertise--play a role in referrals. "I've had referring doctors
say to me, 'I think you're a fantastic surgeon but I'm not going to
send patients to you because you don't pay enough,'" says Dr. Robert
K. Maloney, director of the Maloney-Seibel Vision Institute in L.A..</TE>
<TE>   Given this, what can consumers interested in laser-eye surgery do
to be better informed?</TE>
<TE>   Ask your optometrist questions, experts suggest. They are legally
bound to answer truthfully. Find out if the optometrist is
experienced and has special training in Lasik surgery--in evaluation
before surgery and in postoperative care, which includes treatment of
infections and the ability to spot potentially serious problems. Once
you've decided to undergo the procedure, be sure the ophthalmologist
performs adequate pre-screening and follow-up care. Anywhere from a
week to four weeks of follow-up visits are standard.</TE>
<TE>   Ask your optometrist if he or she has a financial interest in the
clinic to which you're being referred. A "yes" answer should raise a
red flag. Ask them what their monetary arrangement is with the
surgeon. An 80-20 fee split--with the surgeon keeping the lion's
share--is considered equitable. Anything more than that, Maloney
says, "looks like a deal sweetener."</TE>

<LD>I was in shock when I read "Finally, Science Weighs In" (March 18).
The new head of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative
Medicine indicates that he plans to study unconventional medicine
using scientific methods.</LD>
<LD>   The center, which he heads, has already been in existence for 10
years and has spent millions of dollars doing this but to date has
not proven the efficacy or value of even one alternative treatment.</LD>
<LD>   When a treatment that appears to be of value does surface, medical
scientists study it using scientific methods and, if it proves to be
of value, it's added to the physicians' medical armament.</LD>
<TE>   Most alternative treatment methods have proved to be totally
useless, and sometimes harmful, especially if using them delays the
use of evidence-based conventional treatment.</TE>

<HD>Many Reasons to Choose Hysterectomy</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re: "Removal of Uterus Still Common" (March 18): Let's say you are a
woman past your childbearing years and your uterus is causing you
more problems than it is worth.</LD>
<LD>   You may be experiencing pain, dysfunctional bleeding or have a
uterine prolapse (probably because of a vaginal delivery).</LD>
<LD>   You are missing days at work and quality time with your family.</LD>
<TE>   A sex life is a remote memory.</TE>
<TE>   I would expect many women would logically choose a hysterectomy,
and with good reason.</TE>
<TE>   Is a woman not thinking clearly because she wants to end the
problems with one definitive procedure?</TE>
<TE>   Would you really expect most women to elect partial alternative
measures that may lead to repeat procedures, an endless series of
doctor visits or a life of dependence on medication?</TE>
<TE>   Hysterectomy allows the physician to explore the pelvic cavity,
remove the appendix (no one seems to miss that organ) and fix urinary
incontinence (despite the ads on TV, most women do not like to wear
diapers). As to whether these hysterectomies are a "necessity," only
the patient can decide what is a necessity for her.</TE>
<TE>   Believe it or not, I am not advocating hysterectomy. Options are a
good thing.</TE>
<TE>   I am, however, advocating against people who question hysterectomy
as a logical choice.</TE>

<LD>The ongoing publicized discussion about the benefits of mammography
("Debating Breast Exams," March 4) is an important one. It is also
important to remember that each mammogram is of a person/patient.</LD>
<LD>   And it's good the patient has a choice. As a diagnostic
radiologist, I can attest that it's an effective tool in finding
breast cancer earlier--the result of screening exams.</LD>
<LD>   No one can currently predict the growth rate and outcome of every
cancer, and more necessary research is being done in these areas. But
when one speaks with breast cancer patients, they are almost always
grateful for having had the earliest possible detection--whatever the
current prognosis.</LD>

<LD>Question: I'm an avid tennis player, and I was wondering if you know
of any specific exercises I could do on my trampoline to help me on
the court.</LD>
<LD>   --David Dickey</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Trampolining is a cardiovascular and weight-bearing
exercise with effects equal to running--but with less impact. Regular
use can help reduce vascular disease, obesity and osteoporosis.</LD>
<TE>   Try variations on the basic bounce such as twisting jumps, scissor
jumps, jumping jacks and single knee lifts. When exercising on your
trampoline:</TE>
<TE>   Control how high you jump--it's the key to effective bouncing.</TE>
<TE>   For safety's sake, learn to "stop bounce" to prevent loss of
control. This move requires a deep knee bend or squat on the
trampoline to stop out-of-control movements.</TE>
<TE>   Don't attempt somersaults on small trampolines ... unless you're a
member of the circus.</TE>
<TE>   Before jumping:</TE>
<TE>   Read the trampoline's manual carefully.</TE>
<TE>   Make sure the frame pads are securely attached.</TE>
<TE>   Place the trampoline on a level surface.</TE>
<TE>   If outside, keep it away from sharp objects, trees or concrete.</TE>
<TE>   If inside, make sure you have sufficient head room to jump.</TE>

<TE>   What works: AIS is a smart, provocative resource in a
field--mind-body research--that has more than its share of flaky
theories. Its newsletters take on timely, difficult topics, such as
whether "stress-reducing" herbals are safe and why loneliness and
depression can be deadly. One downside is that some of the best
information isn't free: Newsletters cost about $5 and comprehensive
information packets start at $35.</TE>

<HD>From Fitness Experts, Here's the Truth About Stretching</HD>
<DH>Exercise* Forget what was learned in high school gym class.
Some of those methods (remember butterflies and toe touches?) were
harmful.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BUZZ McCLAIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thirty-three years ago, at Edison High in Alexandria, Va., we started
each period of physical education with a warm-up. To my mind, it was
a waste of time: After the tedium of algebra class (Part 1, and I had
to take it twice), I wanted to jump right into the volleyball game.
But there was a tincture of virtue wafting over the gym: Stretching
was good for you, we were told. And so we did it.</LD>
<LD>   Dressed in our high-top Chuck Taylors and bright red cotton
sweats, we--boys only, the girls were in the "girls' gym"--were
arranged in rows across the basketball floor. We did deep knee bends,
push-ups and jumping jacks, then sat on the floor doing "butterflies"
(feet crossed at the ankles and the knees pushed to the floor) and
hurdler stretches.</LD>
<LD>   Thusly stretched, we were permitted to partake of the game of the
day.</LD>
<TE>   Flash forward from 1969 to 2002. I'm at rugby practice, standing
in a wide circle of players. The stretchmeister has us bend at the
waist, touching our toes with quick repetitive motions, bouncing at
the hips for a full 30 seconds. We do the same with our legs crossed
as we stand, and then we drop to the field for butterflies and
hurdler stretches.</TE>
<TE>   For more than 30 years now, I've done these same stretches. And
only now I am learning that, like whole milk, something I once
thought was good for me is not.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not what you learned was wrong," says Judith C. Young,
executive director of the National Assn. for Sport and Physical
Education, or NASPE, in Reston, Va., trying to put a forgiving spin
on the bad news. "It's just out of date."</TE>
<TE>   What's changed over the past 30 years is physiologists'
understanding of the human body and what the common forms of
stretching and calisthenics have been doing to it. Many of the
standards--sit-ups, toe touches, knee bends, hurdler's stretch and
more--have been modified or replaced to reduce the stress they place
on vulnerable joints and muscles.</TE>
<TE>   "As the fields of exercise physiology and biomechanics have
matured, we've become much more knowledgeable in the potential risks
associated with certain exercises," says Cedric Bryant, chief
exercise physiologist at the American Council on Exercise in San
Diego. "Years ago, you didn't have MRI techniques, electromyographic
studies and ways to measure impact forces. All those advances have
allowed us to become more knowledgeable about stresses and loads to
various joints."</TE>
<TE>   But plenty of volunteer coaches and amateur athletes aren't
getting the message. They're still inculcating bad habits--and
old-school ways.</TE>
<TE>   Even some big guns remain defiant.</TE>
<TE>   "If you never take your knees past 90 degrees, you'll have the
stiffest knees you've ever seen," says Bob Anderson, a Colorado
fitness lecturer and mountain biker. Anderson, with his wife, Jean,
wrote the seminal book "Stretching" (Shelter Publications, 1975),
translated into 24 languages and now in its 20th edition. "Head
circles? Yeah, I guess it compresses [the cervical spine], but
sitting [down] all day compresses circulation to your legs. I think
we should eliminate sitting."</TE>
<TE>   His response notwithstanding, we figured it's time to isolate some
commonly misperformed stretches and calisthenics and show the
perpetrators what they're doing wrong.</TE>
<TE>   For the job, we enlisted Young and Chris Brophy, NASPE's program
administrator for research and professional development and a former
fitness instructor. We also sought advice from Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Sit-ups</TE>
<TE>   * Old School: You started flat on your back, legs straight or bent
in front of you, hands behind your head; you struggled to sit up, and
perhaps even continued to bend your head toward your knees. You
repeated this until your stomach gave out.</TE>
<TE>   * New School: "A full sit-up, with the hands pulling from behind
the head, tends to put stress on the cervical region of the spine,"
Bryant says. "And people tend to rock up, tilting the pelvis forward
and putting stress on the lumbar spine."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, the abdominal muscle--the object of desire in this
drill--is a short one; it doesn't require that much range of motion.
Which is why everyone at the gym these days does "ab crunches."</TE>
<TE>   Abdominal crunches start like bent-knee sit-ups, with your hands
at your sides or lightly at the sides of your head, but you come only
a small distance off the floor, perhaps 30 degrees, says Brophy. A
lot of people at the gym do these rapidly, as if doing as many
repetitions in the shortest time is beneficial. It isn't, and the use
of momentum to complete the crunch robs you of the exercise's value.
Hold each crunch for 11/2 to two seconds for maximum benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Toe Touches</TE>
<TE>   * Old School: To stretch your back muscles and hamstrings, you
stood, feet together with knees straight, and then bent at the waist,
attempting to touch your toes--or the floor--with your fingers.</TE>
<TE>   * New School: Flexion exercises requiring you to bend at the waist
put a burden on the short spinal ligaments of the lower back to lift
you up again; bending this way stretches the muscles that support the
spine and weakens them. "You're putting a high load of compressive
force on the lumbar spine," Bryant says. "Over time it can create a
problem."</TE>
<TE>   If your primary goal is stretching your back muscles, lie on your
back and pull one or both knees up to your chest. Hold the stretch
for 15 to 30 seconds. "You're keeping your back stabilized and
supported and avoiding the forward bending that puts a lot of strain
on the low back area," Brophy says.</TE>
<TE>   If your primary goal is stretching the hamstrings, then lie on
your back and pull one leg up until it's perpendicular to your body;
hold it for 15 to 30 seconds. If you can't easily reach your leg,
grip the ends of a towel wrapped around your heel or calf. Don't
"bounce" when you stretch. Bouncing is called "ballistic stretching,"
and it's been shown to lead to injury. Keep motions smooth and
continuous, then hold each repetition for the recommended time.</TE>
<TE>   Hurdler Stretches</TE>
<TE>   * Old School: To stretch your quadriceps, you sat on the floor and
kept one leg straight in front while bending the other leg back and,
like some nimble Gumby, bending it so you nearly sat on your heel.</TE>
<TE>   * New School: Are you nuts? We live in an age when "ACL" (anterior
cruciate ligament) and "MCL" (medial collateral ligament) are as well
known as MRI; think of how unnatural this position is for the knee.
"You're putting lateral pressure on the knee," Young says. You don't
want that.</TE>
<TE>   The modern substitute is the standing quadriceps stretch: Stand on
one foot and pull the other up behind you so that the knee is
pointing to the floor. Hold for 30 seconds if you can, with your head
up.</TE>
<TE>   Or lie on your side, one arm extended above your head, and pull
your top foot up behind you. Do it three times and hold for 30
seconds each time.</TE>
<TE>   Head Circles</TE>
<TE>   * Old School: A favorite at football practice. The idea was to
loosen up the neck. You slowly rotated your neck so that your chin
completed an orbit from your chest to your shoulder to looking
directly up to your opposite shoulder and then back to your chest.</TE>
<TE>   * New School: The old way compresses the cervical disks and can
lead to nerve damage, according to Bryant. Instead, relax your
shoulders and let your chin drop to your chest. Slowly move your head
with the motion of a pendulum from right to left, lifting your chin
only as high as feels comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   With your head upright, drop your left ear to your left shoulder,
or as far as you can go comfortably, and hold it for 10 seconds.
Bring your head back to upright, then drop it to the right shoulder,
slowly, then hold. Repeat 10 times.</TE>
<TE>   Double Leg Lift</TE>
<TE>   * Old School: Flat on your back, you raised both legs 12 to 36
inches from the floor with your hands firmly on the floor beside you.
Not only does this exercise place unwanted stress on the small
muscles of the lower back, says Bryant, it permits the hip flexors
and lower back muscles to do all the work instead of the legs or
abdominals.</TE>
<TE>   * New School: A small adjustment can save a lot of future pain.
When lifting the legs, push the lower back into the space on the
floor under the arch that will naturally occur when the legs are
lifted.</TE>
<TE>   Says Brophy, "If you keep your abdominal muscles held tight and
your lower back pushed firmly into the floor, then your whole trunk
region is more stabilized."</TE>
<TE>   For maximum benefit, keep the lifts to 12 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Deep Knee Bends</TE>
<TE>   * Old School: While standing, with torso straight and arms
extended, you quickly lowered yourself by bending your knees, then
springing up again. You repeated several times or until the crunch of
your knee joint was deafening.</TE>
<TE>   * New School: Knees should never be bent past 90 degrees or
ligaments will get more of a workout than they'll safely tolerate.</TE>
<TE>   For a safer way biomechanically to achieve the desired results, do
squats. Place your feet shoulder-width apart (for balance) and dip as
far down as is comfortable. "As you're bending your knees," says
Brophy, "flex at your waist" and "stick out your butt as if you were
getting ready to sit in a chair."</TE>
<TE>   Don't let your knees go past the end of your toes. It's a much
shorter motion than deep knee bends, but after several sets of 15
reps, you'll feel the effect in the back of the legs.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although halitosis was long thought to be an incurable affliction, in
recent years researchers have learned that bad breath can be treated,
not simply camouflaged.</LD>
<LD>   The breakthrough came in recent years as scientists began to prove
that, contrary to popular belief, bad breath rarely, if ever, stems
from the digestive tract, but is due instead to excessive buildup of
bacteria on the tongue, teeth and gums.</LD>
<LD>   Such bacteria is normally present in the mouth, but it can also
drip from the back of the nose onto the tongue or become trapped
because of poorly fitting crowns, natural gaps and diseased gums.</LD>
<TE>   As with most body odors, the decomposing bacteria create noxious
smelling gases, including hydrogen ulfide, which smells of rotten
eggs and is one of the main culprits in halitosis.</TE>
<TE>   Wiping out bad breath therefore almost always depends on reducing
the levels of bacteria in the mouth.</TE>
<TE>   The first line of attack requires professional dental help to
identify the cause of the problem and to scrape built-up bacteria--in
the form of plaque--from the teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Your dentist or hygienist will also teach you good techniques for
home tooth brushing, tongue scraping and flossing to remove bacteria
on a daily basis.</TE>
<TE>   But you can also hamper the creation of odor-causing bacteria in
the mouth by drinking plenty of water throughout the day to keep
saliva levels up.</TE>
<TE>   Saliva helps wash bacteria out of the mouth and, because it is
slightly acidic, discourages bacterial growth.</TE>
<TE>   It is especially important to drink liquids first thing in the
morning, because salivation is much reduced during sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Green tea may be a good alternative to water then or at any time
of the day. Japanese scientists have recently found that it has
considerable antibacterial effects, especially around the gums.</TE>
<TE>   Between meals, eating raw carrots and celery will clean the teeth
and gums and dislodge bacteria clinging to their surfaces, as will
chewing gum. Although gum as we know it is a thoroughly modern
product, the principle has been around for thousands of years.</TE>
<TE>   The chewing of mastic, a resin from the pistachio tree, is even
referred to in the book of Genesis as a way of freshening the breath.</TE>
<TE>   Sugar-free gum containing xylitol, a natural sweetener with
antibacterial effects, is a good choice because unlike gums with
sweeteners such as sorbitol, it stimulates extra saliva flow.</TE>
<TE>   Alcohol, on the other hand, should be avoided. It lowers saliva
levels by dehydrating the body and acts directly on cells in the
cheeks--drying them out and causing them to secrete protein, which
becomes food for the bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   For this reason, alcohol-containing mouthwashes should also be
avoided.</TE>
<TE>   Full-fat dairy products such as milk and yogurt are best swapped
for low-fat and fat-free versions to help reduce mucus buildup in the
mouth, which slows saliva flow.</TE>
<TE>   You can freshen your breath through diet as well.</TE>
<TE>   Parsley and green drinks such as spirulina and wheat grass are
rich in the odor-absorbing green pigment chlorophyll, and cloves,
fennel and anise seeds are age-old breath fresheners.</TE>
<TE>   Only by dealing with the causes, and not masking the symptoms, can
bad breath be truly eliminated.</TE>

<HD>Waterfront Fixture Is Losing Its Moorings</HD>

<LD>I was at the Boathouse the other day, looking out at the ocean and
waiting for my wife to join me for lunch. It was an overcast day, and
the light kept changing as clouds moved over the face of the sea,
alternately transforming it from gloom to gold.</LD>
<LD>   The restaurant sits on the edge of Santa Monica Pier and offers
one of the best views on the waterfront. In addition to the
ever-changing ocean, there's a wide expanse of beach that lures an
eclectic mix of surf riders, sunbathers and walkers to the sand, no
matter what the weather's like.</LD>
<LD>   I don't have to dress up to go to the Boathouse. On this day I was
wearing old Levi's, a T-shirt that says, "Real Men Don't Ask
Directions," and sneakers without socks. I remember that specifically
because when Cinelli arrived, she looked at my feet and said, with no
small measure of disgust, "Returning to our hippie roots, are we?"</LD>
<TE>   The point is, the Boathouse is a comfortable place with edible
food and a view that's always changing. It's a family affair that has
been there for 50 years, and it has always attracted a friendly mix
of tourists, locals and guys like me, who don't always wear socks.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing trendy about the Boathouse, and it isn't listed in
a lot of the restaurant guidebooks. That's partially because nothing
on the menu is in French. That's fine with me. I can do without coq
de bruyere most of the time, and make do with fish and chips, which
are terrific at the Boathouse.</TE>
<TE>   So why--given its comfort, its view and its longevity--is it
probably about to become a memory? Good question.</TE>
<TE>   For the last few years, Pier Restoration Corp., a Santa Monica
city agency, has been trying to replace the Boathouse with a chain
franchise that would generate more money for the city. But Naia
Sheffield, whose family has owned the place since 1952, says no way.</TE>
<TE>   "I want my damned restaurant!" she said to me one day over
breakfast. Outside, an unrelenting sun shone down on the ocean,
setting it afire and proclaiming its permanence in glowing tones. "I
love this place and I'll do everything I can, I mean everything, to
keep it! I'm not going to roll over. I'm here to stay."</TE>
<TE>   She's a woman in her late 20s, full of angry determination, who is
not about to play dead to the PRC.</TE>
<TE>   Marches, petitions, appearances before the Santa Monica City
Council and finally lawsuits, filed in state and federal courts, have
characterized Sheffield's effort to keep the Boathouse alive.</TE>
<TE>   But time may be running out.</TE>
<TE>   A few days ago, L.A. Superior Court Judge Diana Wheatley ruled
that the days of the Boathouse were over and it had to vacate the
premises. That's legalese for "Pack your frying pans and move on."</TE>
<TE>   One man, Rick Howard, was moved to write poetry about the battle:</TE>
<TE>   It would truly be a shame</TE>
<TE>   If they replaced me with a chain.</TE>
<TE>   I'm a restaurant on the pier,</TE>
<TE>   The Boathouse is my name.</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly Dylan Thomas, but it gets the message across.</TE>
<TE>   When the Boathouse lease ended about three years ago, bidding was
opened to anyone interested. That, supposedly, is standard procedure.
The Bubba Gump company, Landry's Seafood Restaurants and the Lobster,
submitted proposals. So did Sheffield, who was operating on a
month-to-month basis.</TE>
<TE>   The problem, said PRC Chairman Michael Klein, was that hers was
the worst of the proposals. She wanted a motorcycle theme for a
revamped Boathouse that had nothing to do with the kind of family
restaurant the PRC wanted. Ultimately, the Lobster, which runs a
restaurant of the same name at the head of the pier, pulled out of
the running and the board chose Bubba Gump.</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield has been served with an eviction notice and, barring a
miracle, it's goodbye, old-place-to-go-without-socks.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish that their bid had been a good one," Klein says of the
Boathouse proposal, "but it wasn't."</TE>
<TE>   Some time ago, the venerable old Lobster Shack restaurant was
replaced with the glitzy, overpriced Lobster at the head of the pier.
And now the Boathouse appears to be on its way out. I don't know what
Bubba Gump is all about, but already I don't like it.</TE>
<TE>   I guess I can appreciate an effort to upgrade, but it saddens me
to see a place rich with tradition disappear from the waterfront. The
city could have given the Boathouse a little more of an edge to stay
where it is, considering its 50 years on the pier. But I also feel
that Sheffield could have come up with something better than a
motorcycle theme for a place that has nothing to do with motorcycles.</TE>
<TE>   As far as I'm concerned, the whole thing isn't really about money
or upgrading, but about saving a restaurant where a guy without socks
can eat fish and chips in comfort while looking out at an ocean that
is always new, but always old.</TE>
<TE>   The PRC may think it's just doing good business, but what it's
doing is tearing the heart out of a house of memories, and that's a
rotten shame.</TE>

<LD>FREEDOM AND ITS BETRAYAL</LD>
<LD>   Six Enemies of Human Liberty</LD>
<LD>   By Isaiah Berlin</LD>
<TE>   Edited by Henry Hardy</TE>
<TE>   Princeton University Press</TE>
<TE>   198 Pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Imagine turning on the radio and hearing a brilliant, immensely
erudite man speaking extemporaneously at breakneck pace for a full
hour about the ideas of an 18th century philosopher. Not a likely
prospect, even on NPR. Yet in austerity Britain of 1952, people
tuning in to the BBC were surprised to hear the voice of a
43-year-old Oxford don, Isaiah Berlin, doing just that. In fact, the
radio audience was treated not merely to one, but six hourlong
broadcasts on influential thinkers of the late 18th and early 19th
centuries.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to current nostrums about the need to aim low to attract
an audience, people "tuned in expectantly each week and found
themselves mesmerized." Now, half a century later, the lectures are
finally available in written form, assiduously edited from rough
transcripts by Henry Hardy, one of Berlin's literary trustees.</TE>
<TE>   Berlin chose these six thinkers because he felt the issues they
grappled with were still enormously relevant. All addressed the
central question: "Why should anyone obey anyone else?" Berlin's
lectures attempt to demonstrate how these men--some of them devoted
to the cause of freedom and all but one of them, Joseph de Maistre,
devoted to the betterment of mankind--generated ideas that may have
actually contributed to the diminution of human liberty.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, readers familiar with Berlin's work will find in these
spirited lectures the seeds of his later thinking. Already we see his
distrust of grand schemes that sound promising, but generally end up
depriving individuals of their freedom.</TE>
<TE>   In the rationalist French philosopher Claude Adrien Helvetius,
Berlin finds the direct ancestor of modern utilitarianism. Helvetius
proposed that government exists to produce the greatest happiness for
the greatest number of people. But, since the majority of people are
not sufficiently clearsighted about what is in their own best
interest, Helvetius argued that an enlightened elite should make such
decisions for them, thus (in Berlin's opinion) providing the
groundwork for communist dictatorships.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Helvetius, countryman Jean-Jacques Rousseau distrusted
experts, scientists and intellectuals. What mattered to him was
personal liberty. But rather than conceiving of such liberty as the
freedom to make mistakes as well as wise choices, Rousseau understood
it as the ability and willingness to do that which is natural, good
and harmonious. Those who do not make healthy choices are not "free,"
hence society can force them to be free for their own good. Once you
define freedom this way, Berlin argues, Robespierre, Mussolini, Lenin
and Hitler can use it to justify their coercive methods.</TE>
<TE>   In discussing the German idealist philosopher Johann Gottlieb
Fichte, Berlin notes that Fichte, like Rousseau, begins with absolute
respect for the individual soul. But from this (perhaps in order to
avoid anarchy), he arrives at a theory that the true inner self is
linked to the larger idea of one's fellow countrymen; hence romantic
nationalism and hero worship. Rather unfairly perhaps, Berlin brands
Fichte's philosophy as the kind of thinking that paved the way for
Napoleons and Hitlers, even though Fichte explicitly denounced
Napoleon as a false hero.</TE>
<TE>   Critiquing German thinker Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Berlin is
on much stronger ground. Hegel postulated the notion of history as
the manifestation of an inexorable spiritual power. Wars, massacres,
oppression, rebellion: All these were necessary steps in the
unfolding of its grand, presumably progressive, scheme. Such an
outlook naturally tended to justify history's victors while
generating little if any sympathy for those unfortunate enough to be
its victims.</TE>
<TE>   Berlin's essay on Claude-Henri Saint-Simon is in many ways the
most delightful. Here, too, he has criticisms, but one also senses a
genuine affection and admiration for the man. This engaging French
aristocrat fought in the American Revolution and behaved with almost
Sydney Carton-like gallantry in the French Revolution. Berlin saw him
as a prophet of the modern welfare state and technocracy. And unlike
many other thinkers, Saint-Simon understood the need to judge things
in the proper historical context and to refrain from universal
theorizing.</TE>
<TE>   Berlin's final essay, on Maistre, details the scary "modernity" of
his reactionary views with a kind of ghoulish glee. Appalled by the
chaos of the French Revolution, Maistre set out to demolish the 18th
century thinking that led up to it. Ironically, in his determination
to throw out babies along with bathwater, he was exactly like the
most radical members of the revolution he hated so much.</TE>
<TE>   On his hit list were not only the notions of liberty, equality and
fraternity, but science, knowledge and reason itself. Darkness,
ignorance, fear, war and slavery were, in his view, the necessary
condition of mankind. If Maistre is, in Berlin's view, the true
ancestor of Nazism, why then does Berlin also cast blame for it on
thinkers whose ideas Maistre hated: men like Helvetius, Rousseau,
Fichte and Saint-Simon? Because he wants to show how even
benign-sounding ideas can unwittingly have a malign effect.</TE>
<TE>   Berlin's favorite paradox--that some defenders of liberty may turn
out to be its enemies--seems to have had a pervasive influence on
other anti-totalitarian and neo-conservative writers like John Lukacs
and Paul Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Reading these essays, I was reminded of the latter's vitriolic, ad
hominem portraits of left-wing thinkers, including Rousseau, in his
book "Intellectuals." Where Johnson launches into fierce attacks on
the characters of his subjects, Berlin pretty much assumes that his
six thinkers meant well. His focus is on exposing the flaws in their
works. The contrast between Berlin's nimble criticism and Johnson's
blunt rancor is sharply instructive, and may also go to show how any
salutary-seeming approach can go askew over time.</TE>

<HD>Bust Magazine Refuses to Go, Well, Bust</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN CARPENTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Sept. 10, business was not only good it was about to get better
for Bust, the women's magazine with a sexy, sassy spin on feminism.
The New York Times had just run a front-page business feature about
feminist magazines that included this grass-roots 'zine that had
grown from 500 to 100,000 subscribers, and billboards across New York
City were touting the imminent launch of an even bigger, better Bust.</LD>
<LD>   Then came Sept. 11 and what looked like its demise. Citing
financial difficulties, Razorfish Studios, the Internet content
provider that had bought the magazine one year earlier, went out of
business the following month, leaving Bust's founders with a tough
decision: Let their magazine die or buy it back.</LD>
<LD>   "When it folded, I was like, 'OK. I'm done. I don't want to do it
again,'" said editor in chief Debbie Stoller, 39, who, like her
partner, had devoted thousands of unpaid hours to the project. "I
couldn't even put on my own Bust T-shirt."</LD>
<TE>   But magazine co-creator Laurie Henzel, 37, thought otherwise.
"It's one thing to lose your job," she said. "It's another thing to
lose something you created and built from the ground up."</TE>
<TE>   In December, after two months of negotiation, Stoller and Henzel
bought back the rights to the magazine they'd spent eight years
creating. This month, they are putting out their first issue since
last summer, using their own money and cash from subscriptions and
two fund-raisers.</TE>
<TE>   It is a humble--and humbling--new beginning for the publication
that had grown into a 100-page glossy from its
printing-by-photocopying start. Bust was the brainchild of a couple
of New York secretaries and a graphic designer who wanted to create a
new kind of magazine--and did--but that wasn't enough to prevent its
crash landing. Can it reconnect with its former readers? Attract new
ones? Succeed at a time when many magazines, feminist and otherwise,
are struggling?</TE>
<TE>   It's a gamble Bust it going to take.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine "for women with something to get off their chests"
was founded in 1993 by Stoller (at the time, a secretary for
Nickelodeon), Henzel (a graphic designer) and Marcelle Karp (also a
secretary at Nickelodeon; she left the magazine last year to take
care of her baby). The three shared the belief that feminism had
morphed since Gloria Steinem founded Ms. magazine in 1972, that it
had become less angry, more playful, with struggles for individuality
as much as equality.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to make a feminist magazine that was reflecting some of
the stuff younger feminists were talking about and also one that
would serve as an antidote to all the mainstream women's media,"
Stoller said. "There were a lot of things going on in the early '90s
that other bastions of feminism like Ms. were ignoring. There was all
this stuff with ... [the] Riot Grrrl [movement] and reclaiming and
more pro-sex feminism and just pop culture in general as a site for
criticism and critique. We wanted to make a magazine that the effect
of reading it would make you feel good and un-alone."</TE>
<TE>   What makes Bust different from other feminist magazines is its
sense of humor, said Samir A. Husni, a journalism professor and
magazine tracker at the University of Mississippi. While Bust's
approach is appreciated by its readership, Husni is less sure the
magazine's overall message is necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's a need for a mass feminist magazine anymore
because the women's magazines that are already on the market are
doing that job," he said. "How many magazines do we have now that
promote women staying at home to cook for their husbands? Even Ladies
Home Journal and Woman's Day no longer have that approach."</TE>
<TE>   Ms. Magazine, he said, "was like the candle that lit the way to
other women's magazines, but then the candle melted. Now there's
light all over the place."</TE>
<TE>   Despite its long history, name recognition and support of the
Feminist Majority Foundation, even Ms. is suffering. Once a monthly,
it is published quarterly. It also decided recently to accept
advertising, when it once prided itself on being ad-free.</TE>
<TE>   "If Bust stays small and targeted, they have a good chance," Husni
said. "As long as they continue serving their cult, and I mean that
in a positive way, they will survive. If they have expansion plans to
be all over the country, that's not going to work."</TE>
<TE>   The September 2001 "living single" issue, the last to be funded by
Razorfish, contained articles on single motherhood by choice,
spinster pride, sex and the single gay girl, and TV singles from "The
Mary Tyler Moore Show" to "Sex and the City," as well as an essay
titled "Single Fat Female: When personal ads rule out your body type,
it's hard not to take it personally."</TE>
<TE>   Bust was and is a sort of two-way street--a place for readers to
learn about unique and unusual women and a place to contribute
through heartfelt essays, often submitted under pseudonyms such as
Betty Boob and Girlbomb. In many ways, Bust picked up where the
groundbreaking teen magazine Sassy left off. Founded by Jane Pratt in
1988, Sassy taught girls to value their own opinions and claim their
own power, not pander to male interests.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a ton of stuff out there in the media that supports all
these stereotypes about women," said Stoller. "As a woman you get
lost in all those lies. It's difficult and it's really empowering to
reach through and bust some of the stereotypes [so] you know that
you're not alone."</TE>
<TE>   It was an idea that caught on quickly. In 1993, about 500 copies
of the 30-page 'zine were surreptitiously Xeroxed and stapled
together at someone's day job, then sold through independent record
and book stores. In 2000, before Razorfish Studios bought the
magazine, it had grown from a AA cup to a C, its founders joke. It
was a four-color, 100-page glossy with 35,000 subscribers. "It had
grown into this giant thing that sucked up all our time, and while it
was fun and rewarding, after a while you can't do that much work for
nothing," said Henzel. "It just takes away from the rest of your
life."</TE>
<TE>   Bust's founders made the decision to join Razorfish because they
felt they couldn't build the magazine any further without new
funding. The three-year contract with Razorfish allowed Stoller and
Henzel full creative control and enough cash to hire a small staff.
For the first time in Bust's history, the two were able to work on it
full time, pay their contributors and take home a paycheck. And, in
one year, they saw circulation triple.</TE>
<TE>   Before then, the magazine had been a "try-quarterly," as Stoller
called it, meaning they tried to be quarterly but usually squeezed
out just two issues a year. Once Razorfish stepped in, that problem
seemed to be solved. The magazine went quarterly in 2001 and was
poised to go monthly in January this year, in the hopes Bust could
grow to 250,000 by the end of 2002 and compete with Cosmo, Jane, the
now-defunct Mademoiselle and other glossy women's mags. It never got
that chance.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Bust is back in the hands of Stoller and Henzel, however,
they are determined to keep it quarterly. To help offset costs,
Bust's founders held two fund-raisers--a concert, headlined by the
Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, in New York in early March; the second
was this past weekend, a cabaret-style party in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Bust is starting over at a time when nearly all magazines are
experiencing a decline in ad sales and are contracting in size, said
Steve Cohn, editor in chief of the New York-based Media Industry
Newsletter. But, Cohn said, "Sometimes to relaunch in a bad time is
good because there's less things out there going on."</TE>
<TE>   He pointed to Allure, a women's magazine that launched during the
1991 recession and remains in business today. "Anything new at a time
when you're seeing contraction certainly raises eyebrows."</TE>
<TE>   Bust's new issue is themed Fight Like a Girl, a metaphor for the
magazine's trip from rags to riches to starting over and finding a
way to survive on its own. Indie actress Lili Taylor is on the cover.
Inside are stories on the Power Puff Girls, fighting breast cancer,
joining the Army and being a suicide bomber.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working harder than ever and getting paid zero, but ... I
have to say," said Stoller, "it feels great to have it back."</TE>

<HD>Plus-Size Club Figures on Fun</HD>
<DH>At a Culver City bar, it's girls' night out for big women
and the place to be for the guys who love them.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Club Curves in Culver City is more or less a standard nightclub.
There's a big, beefy guy checking IDs at the door, dim lighting
inside, a DJ spinning R&amp;B and hip-hop jams, and a roomful of men and
women doing what men and women do in places like this: checking each
other out, dropping their best pick-up lines, sipping cocktails and
getting their groove on. But there is one distinction. The women here
are big. You could call them BBWs, for big beautiful women, the
popular acronym many use to describe themselves and one another.</LD>
<LD>   Shadoe Gray, 37, an entrepreneur and freelance computer
consultant, and her business partner, Michelle Wilson, 32, an
administrator for the city of Los Angeles, BBWs themselves, opened
the club late last summer after two years of market research. While
other groups such as Big Difference, Ample Images and Mor2Luv host
social gatherings locally, they don't happen on a regular basis or at
a fixed location, Gray said, making events hard to follow.</LD>
<LD>   "We have just opened the doors to big girls to go out and not wait
every three months for an event," she said. "They don't need to wait
for a big event to party. It's not fair."</LD>
<TE>   Club Curves, which operates in the former Bar Azure on Sepulveda
Boulevard, was a little slow to take off. "Initially, a lot of people
did a 'Let's wait and see,'" Gray said. But word has obviously gotten
out, primarily via the Internet (the club has a Web site, at
www.clubcurves.cc), where there is a vibrant BBW community. About 200
people pack the house each Saturday night and a second night was
recently added--Friday evenings is now karaoke--and they hope to open
Club Curves every night. Gray has even been fielding calls from BBWs
and club owners around the country asking her to open in their town.
"There's definitely a need," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Terri Harris and her friend Lynn Solo, both 34, drive in nearly
every weekend from Rancho Cucamonga. "This is a place where you can
be free and do what you want and not worry about stigmas other clubs
put on you," said Harris, at the recent monthly pajama jam, a.k.a.
lingerie night, especially popular with men. "For myself, coming to
this club has made me more open about who I am and expressing myself
to anyone. Before, I would not go to clubs. Now I don't have a
problem going to other clubs and being the only fat girl."</TE>
<TE>   Gray hears this sort of thing all the time. "There are women who
have never had the nightclub experience," she said. "A lot of
full-figured women are married. Men will marry us but not go out in
public with us. [The women] have never had that type of social
interaction where a guy would ask them to dance. But it's not all
that way. A lot of the women who come here have no self-esteem
problems."</TE>
<TE>   Take Kelli Payne, 28, of Long Beach, who was at the club recently
for the second time. (On her first visit, shortly after the club
opened, she met someone whom she dated for several months.) "I've
been big all my life and I've never let it stop me from doing
anything. Just because you're big doesn't mean you can't flaunt it
like the little girls. We just have more of it."</TE>
<TE>   A common misconception about BBW gatherings is that the men too
are big. While there were perhaps more big men on average at Club
Curves on a recent Saturday night as compared to most other clubs,
there were plenty of thin ones too. There were tall men, short men,
men in flannel work shirts and others in stylish sport jackets. And,
like the women, they were a racially diverse group. It would, in
fact, be impossible to generalize about the men here, except to say
they like and, in many cases, prefer big women.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a definite attraction to girls who are a little larger,"
said a slim, handsome 38-year-old Costco employee from Los Angeles,
who, like nearly all of the men here, did not want his name used. "In
truth," he added, "I think a lot of guys do. But they're not willing
to admit it for fear of being harassed by their buddies."</TE>
<TE>   Among some BBWs, there is a concern that a place such as Club
Curves further marginalizes a group that is already marginalized. "In
a way we are doing that," Gray admitted. "Unfortunately, the way
society is, that is sometimes how you have to make a change."</TE>
<TE>   "Some people might fall into the trap that that's the only place
they could meet someone," said Linda Ramos, president of the Los
Angeles chapter of the National Assn. to Advance Fat Acceptance. "And
that would be a problem. But, overall, it's a positive
reinforcement."</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a really positive step in the right direction for
large women and those who like them," said a rugged 37-year-old
construction worker from the South Bay. And while thinner women are
certainly welcome, "the funny thing is," Gray said, "they don't get
any attention."</TE>

<LD>At first glance, this looks like a very simple painting. The artist,
Francisco de Zurbaran, has arranged fruit, orange blossoms, a flower
and a cup of water on a plain brown table. These are everyday items
that you might find at home. This kind of painting is called a still
life. It focuses on natural and man-made objects.</LD>
<LD>   Look closer, and you will see that the painting is not as simple
as it appears. Notice how the artist chose objects with different
colors and textures--shiny metal plates; a woven straw basket; a
soft, pink rose; and a cool, smooth cup. And while it may seem to be
merely an assortment of pretty objects, the painting has religious
meaning as well. The lemons (a special variety called citrons) are
associated with Passover and Easter, blossoming oranges with the
Virgin Mary, and the rose and cup of water symbolize love and purity.
People in 17th century Spain would have easily recognized these
symbols.</LD>
<LD>   Francisco de Zurbaran spent most of his career painting religious
scenes, especially saints in prayer. When he was not busy working for
the Catholic Church, the king of Spain and monasteries, he enjoyed
making paintings like this. "Still Life With Lemons, Oranges, and a
Rose" is his only signed and dated work.</LD>
<TE>   You can see Zurbaran's still life as well as other masterpieces of
European, Indian and Southeast Asian art at the Norton Simon Museum.

<HD>Pardon Me, Boss, but Your Manners Need Some Work</HD>
<DH>Etiquette lessons, given at the office, may be good for
business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN GREGG GILMORE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the young stockbroker sat down for a trendy power lunch, he
flipped his Hermes tie over his shoulder and positioned his elbows
squarely on the table. He chewed his food with his mouth open, and
after buttering his bread, licked the knife clean.</LD>
<LD>   More than one client who endured a meal with him complained to the
company's president. And soon this well-educated but socially
inexperienced professional found himself enrolled in a remedial
workshop learning to not blow on hot food, not to use a toothpick at
the table and not to dip his fingers in the water glass. More
important, he learned that good manners mean good business.</LD>
<LD>   Pamela Hillings is the corporate etiquette consultant who was
called in to retrain the L.A.-based up-and-comer. For almost 20
years, Hillings has taught Southern California executives from
Universal Studios to Bank of America the do's and don'ts of correct
social behavior, giving them, she believes, a visible edge over the
competition.</LD>
<TE>   "Good manners really do affect the bottom line," said Hillings,
who happily reports that her former student is no longer
self-cleaning the silverware but gracefully climbing the corporate
ladder.</TE>
<TE>   Every generation remembers a day gone by when people knew how to
act with grace and civility, when words like "please" and "thank you"
were part of the native tongue. Stories of today's business
professionals clipping their toenails at their desk or brushing their
teeth at the office drinking fountain seem incredible, but are,
according to the experts, sadly true. So, do Americans really think
that as a nation we are less concerned with the rules of social
conduct than we were even a decade ago?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, ma'am, we do.</TE>
<TE>   As we set the table for the 21st century, we believe that we treat
one another with less respect and courtesy than in the past. In fact,
according to a survey by Public Agenda, the nonpartisan, nonprofit
think tank, 73% of Americans are convinced we are less considerate.</TE>
<TE>   People increasingly see themselves dealing with encounters of rude
behavior and incivility, according to Jean Johnson, one of the
survey's authors. Road rage ranked as the first complaint in focus
groups conducted in cities of all sizes.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, except for police-documented cases like those of
road rage or workplace violence, no scientific data exist to support
this gut feeling that we're just not as nice as we used to be.</TE>
<TE>   When Hillings signed on with RBF Consulting, one of the largest
engineering firms in Orange County, to work with the company's
managerial team, the goal was to give the employees confidence in
social situations.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are entertaining a client and are worried about whether
you're using the correct fork or not, then you're not completely
focusing on the business at hand," said RBF's Trinka Burdick, vice
president of human resources. "We want our people to have that
confidence, that extra edge."</TE>
<TE>   Professional men and women compete today in a global economy. As
the world changes, so does our code of conduct. Every generation
creates new rules to deal with its specific issues, whether it is
single parenting, women in the workplace or international etiquette.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, manners must be fluid, said Peggy Post, the manners
maven now at the helm of the family's etiquette dynasty. It was
Peggy's great grandmother-in-law, Emily Post, who wrote the renowned
book of manners in 1922, making the unspoken rules of high society
available to everyone. Now, more than 75 years later, the Post family
continues to guide Americans through all sorts of social occasions
from weddings and dinner parties to the often-forgotten thank-you
note.</TE>
<TE>   As the Posts prepare the 17th edition of the original handbook to
be released next year, they want to know what breaches in protocol
bother you the most. Surveys currently posted on their Web site at
www.emilypost.com query readers about everything from e-mail to
voicemail.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to readers' concerns about workplace behavior, Peggy
and her brother-in-law, Peter Post, co-authored "The Etiquette
Advantage in Business: Personal Skills for Professional Success"
(HarperCollins, 1999), touching on every business situation from the
hiring and firing of employees to traveling abroad. Etiquette does,
in their opinion, make the difference between getting ahead or not,
disavowing the myth that nice guys finish last.</TE>
<TE>   Peggy Post is the first to acknowledge that a long list of rigid
rules gives good manners a bad name. "Etiquette is really about how
we treat one another," she said. It is a combination of common sense,
kindness and consideration.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Emily Post Institute, 59% of Americans would
rather visit the dentist than sit next to someone talking on a cell
phone in a movie theater. There is a time and a place for everything
and a church, restaurant or movie theater are definitely not the
place for a cell phone conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Simply put, there are reasons for the rules. They help us get
along with one another. P.M. Forni, author of the soon-to-be released
"Choosing Civility: The Twenty-Five Rules of Considerate Conduct"
(St. Martin's Press), believes that training in manners is training
in sensitivity.</TE>
<TE>   Manners are based on an essential awareness of others, said Forni,
who is also co-founder of the Johns Hopkins Civility Project,
academic and outreach programs concerned with the state of civility
in society.</TE>
<TE>   "Rudeness," he said, "is the weak man's imitation of strength."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody would accuse the police officers of Beverly Hills of being
weak, although they may look a bit out of place when they step into
Paddington's Tea Room for a spot of Earl Grey. Don't let the uniforms
fool you though; these cops know how to pour their tea and prepare
their scones properly. Beverly Hills proprietor and native Brit
Julianne Tozer has seen to that for the past six years. Never passing
up the opportunity to teach the etiquette of tea, this is her way of
giving back to the defenders of her community.</TE>
<TE>   She and her son began the practice by arriving at the 7 a.m. roll
call. Before long, Tozer was demonstrating how to use a strainer and
how to spread the scone with jam, then Devonshire cream. "Proper
manners give us confidence," Tozer said. "More important, they give
us a kinder heart."</TE>

<HD>What the Marine Saw</HD>
<DH>A combat correspondent captures images from the front lines
during a recent mission in Afghanistan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAMP PENDLETON</DL>
<LD>When combat troops from the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit arrived by
helicopter in southern Afghanistan in the middle of the night to
seize a former Taliban base, every U.S. Marine in the raiding force
was packing a loaded M-16. One was also armed with a Nikon and a Sony
video camera.</LD>
<LD>   Sgt. Joseph Chenelly, 25, a combat correspondent, was there as a
rifleman, but also to document the unit's attempt to establish the
first operating base in Afghanistan for conventional U.S. troops.</LD>
<LD>   He was also there a few days later when heavily armed Marine
"hunter-killer" teams moved cautiously toward the Taliban stronghold
of Kandahar--unsure whether Afghan villagers would treat them as
liberators or enemies.</LD>
<TE>   And when Marines engaged in a fierce firefight in the pitch dark
with Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters, Chenelly captured the action on
video even as heat and light from exploding ordnance momentarily
blinded his night vision lens.</TE>
<TE>   With the rest of the 15th unit, Chenelly returned to Camp
Pendleton last month, and now many of his pictures from 45 days on
the front lines are on the Marine Corps Web site at
www.usmc.mil/15meu.</TE>
<TE>   The images provide an intimate look at the challenges of the
Marine mission in Afghanistan: the blowing sand, Marine scouts
digging in for combat, hungry Afghan children with bewildered faces,
the American flag flying over war-torn Kandahar's airport and more.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a dream assignment," says Chenelly, who studied journalism
in college in his hometown of Rochester, N.Y., before enlisting in
the Marine Corps.</TE>
<TE>   It was also a uniquely Marine assignment.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the military services has a job that involves taking
pictures and writing accounts of troops in action, either for
distribution within the military or to the media.</TE>
<TE>   But the Marine Corps goes a significant step further, emphasizing
that its combat correspondents are Marines first, correspondents
second. A camera and notepad are important, a rifle and knife are
mandatory. "I always stressed to my combat correspondents that they
had to out-grunt the grunts," said retired Col. Fred Peck. "When we'd
go on a 25-mile hump [hike], none of my CCs would even think of
dropping out. They'd die first."</TE>
<TE>   None of the unit's Marines knew what awaited them at the Camp
Rhino site as the CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters airlifted from
the amphibious assault ship Peleliu in the Arabian Sea and other
secret staging areas in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The date was Nov. 25, and the only U.S. troops "in country" at
that point were scattered units of special forces working with Afghan
opposition fighters and serving as spotters for the U.S. bombing
campaign. The Marines were the first conventional U.S. troops
involved. Although Army special forces had "cleared" the desert area
around Rhino days earlier, the possibility remained of enemy snipers,
land mines or other booby traps. After decades of war, Afghanistan is
considered the most heavily land-mined country in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very disorienting to be there in the middle of the night
with no landmarks for miles around," Chenelly said. "And everything,
everywhere was covered with dust. The first thing I worried about was
my camera: Would it stay operational?"</TE>
<TE>   The dust was a continual hazard during the Marines' six-week stay
at Rhino, making it difficult to land cargo planes, contributing to
the crash of a Huey helicopter, jamming machinery and weaponry. Even
training at the Marines' base in the high desert of San Bernardino
County had not prepared them for the grit of central Asia.</TE>
<TE>   "In Twentynine Palms, it's dirt," Chenelly said. "This was dust.
Dirt will blind you but dust will make it so you can't breathe."</TE>
<TE>   Once Camp Rhino was established, Marines from the elite Force
Reconnaissance moved northward to intercept Taliban and Al Qaeda
forces fleeing a major battle north of Kandahar to regroup and
possibly mount a counteroffensive.</TE>
<TE>   In Humvees and light-armored vehicles, Marines moved slowly
through villages in search of fleeing enemy troops. They disarmed
anyone suspected of being Taliban or Al Qaeda fighters and, if they
were not hostile, let them go. Villagers, mostly old men and
children, greeted the Marines.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't know whether they would attack us or be supportive or
something in between," Chenelly said. "It was a very tense several
days, always keeping our eyes wide open."</TE>
<TE>   As helicopters on resupply missions swooped low, villagers would
wave. When a Marine vehicle had trouble fording a stream, villagers
made a rock bridge. To show their gratitude, Marines gave away food
packages and called for an Air Force food drop.</TE>
<TE>   To prevent enemy vehicles from fleeing Kandahar, the Marines were
ordered on the night of Dec. 7 to set up a roadblock. Thirty feet of
razor-sharp concertina wire was strung across a narrow asphalt road
and anchored by tent pegs.</TE>
<TE>   Glowing "chemlights" were attached to the wire so the roadblock
could be seen by oncoming drivers. Marines positioned their vehicles
at the bottom of a berm beside the road and snipers crouched several
hundred yards away. Chenelly took up his video camera.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after 4 a.m., headlights were spotted rushing toward the
roadblock. A truck hit the concertina wire and skidded to a stop. On
the video, Marines can be heard calling to each other excitedly, "He
blew it. He blew it." Chenelly remembers the sound of the wire
scraping the side of the truck. A Marine who speaks the local Afghan
dialect shouted for the men in the truck to drop their weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, men in the cab and the truck bed--who appeared to be
sleeping--raised their AK-47s at the Marines, some of whom were just
10 feet away. In an instant, both sides began firing--captured on
video as green glowing tracer rounds. "Force Recon didn't hesitate
for a second," Chenelly said. "They didn't flinch. If they had, I
don't think we'd have all made it out alive."</TE>
<TE>   The heat of the rounds ignited an ammunition cache in the back of
the truck. Rounds, including rocket-propelled grenades, shot off in
all directions, like some deadly Fourth of July celebration.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very surreal when it's happening," said Chenelly. "For a
second, you can't believe it. It's like an Arnold Schwarzenegger
movie. It goes so fast and everything blows up."</TE>
<TE>   Seconds later, Marines can be heard on the video calling out, "Go,
go, go, quick, quick, get back." An authoritative voice--that of a
master sergeant, the ranking Marine on the scene--barks out, "Let me
know when everybody is in."</TE>
<TE>   The Marines withdrew down the road, leaving eight Taliban and Al
Qaeda members dead, their truck a flaming ruin. The Marines left the
bodies on the road as a warning to others who might decide to fight
rather than surrender. None of the Marines were injured.</TE>
<TE>   The inevitable question: Were you afraid?</TE>
<TE>   "There was no time to be scared," Chenelly said. "I was just
confident with the Marines out there and confident that the command
wouldn't put us in a situation that we couldn't handle."</TE>
<TE>   Quiet and deferential, Chenelly is set to leave active duty soon.
He may go back to college or take a civilian job as a reporter or
photographer. Asked about his best memory of Afghanistan, his answer
is more Marine than correspondent. He remembers that night on Route 1
with Force Recon.</TE>
<TE>   A helicopter arrived the day after the firefight to pick up
Chenelly's video so the film could be reviewed by military brass back
at Camp Rhino, the Pentagon and the U.S. Central Command in Tampa,
Fla.</TE>
<TE>   After the firefight, and an aerial attack minutes later that
destroyed other trucks in the enemy convoy, the Taliban and Al Qaeda
never again tried to use the road. Afghan opposition forces won the
battle at Kandahar, and the Taliban government toppled.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically we took that route away from them," Chenelly said.
"That felt good."</TE>

<HD>Kate Shelley: Heroine of Honey Creek</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH VAN STEENWYK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a late afternoon in July 1881, Kate Shelley stared out the window.
Rain and wind pounded the family farm in Iowa. She could hardly see
Honey Creek, a stream that wandered through the meadow below. The
railroad tracks that followed the stream bed were invisible. When Pa
was alive, he worked for the railroad and inspected the tracks every
day. He inspected the bridge across Honey Creek, too. Would the
bridge be safe to cross in this storm?</LD>
<LD>   Kate noticed the water rising in the creek. It was getting close
to the barn.</LD>
<LD>   "I've got to get the animals to higher ground," she told Ma.</LD>
<TE>   Kate was a teenager, but she did all Pa's work on the farm now.
She put on Pa's old rain slicker and dashed into the storm.
Unlatching the door of the barn, she shooed the cows and horses to
higher pasture. Then she carried the baby pigs to the house so her
little brother and sister could play with them while she watched the
storm again.</TE>
<TE>   Kate's mother joined her at the window. "I'm worried."</TE>
<TE>   "Me, too," Kate said. "Pa used to say he could set his watch by
the Midnight Express because it was always on time."</TE>
<TE>   "But the bridge might not last until midnight," Ma answered.</TE>
<TE>   Kate and Ma continued to watch and listen. At 11 p.m. they heard a
train whistle down by the bridge. "That can't be the Midnight Express
yet," Ma said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the helper engine that always clears the track for the
Express," Kate said.</TE>
<TE>   Kate and Ma saw the engine light move carefully onto the bridge
below.</TE>
<TE>   Then they heard brakes squealing and men shouting. The engine
light disappeared, and they heard nothing but the roar of the angry
storm.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: What has happened to the engine and its crew?</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Van Steenwyk loves to write stories set in the Midwest,

<HD>Andersen Insurer Balks at Payout</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Accounting firm Andersen said Sunday that its insurance carrier would
not pay $217million to a Baptist fund-raising group to settle
allegations of accounting malpractice.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen lawyers have sent a letter to parties involved in the
lawsuit settlement informing them that its insurance carrier,
Professional Services Insurance Co., has not approved the payment to
a trust for the Baptist Foundation of America, Andersen said.</LD>
<LD>   Additional details regarding the matter were not available.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen had agreed to pay within 45 days of the March 1
settlement, which averted a trial over charges of negligence against
Andersen by the trust. Andersen did not admit any wrongdoing in the
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement was the second-largest payout by one of the Big
Five accounting firms. The biggest settlement involved Ernst &amp; Young,
which in 1999 paid $335million to investors in travel and real estate
company Cendant Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The Baptist Foundation, under bankruptcy protection and
represented by the liquidation trust, alleged that Andersen breached
its fiduciary duties by failing to disclose financial wrongdoing by
former trust managers even after it was alerted to the fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen said others, including the state of Arizona, the
foundation's law firm and the Arizona Southern Baptist Convention,
were all warned of possible irregularities at the fund-raising group
and had failed to act.</TE>

<HD>Bank's Woes Could Cost L.A. Millions</HD>
<DH>Probe: City may have to return federal funds because of
Community Development Bank's failure to meet job-creation goals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of Los Angeles could be forced to repay millions of dollars
to the federal government because the Los Angeles Community
Development Bank failed to meet performance goals, city officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   The bank, overseen by the city, was funded by the federal
Department of Housing and Urban Development to revitalize
impoverished neighborhoods. In return for funding, the bank was
required to create jobs for residents in target neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   But the bank has fallen short on those requirements, in part
because of a $35-million program to channel venture capital to
technology start-ups in hopes of a fast payoff in the stock market.
The technology companies are situated outside the core zone the bank
aims to serve and have hired only a handful of local residents.</LD>
<TE>   Preliminary findings of an audit by HUD's Office of Inspector
General have raised the possibility that the city will have to repay
HUD out of its general fund, according to officials who have been
briefed on the findings.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Eric Garcetti, who chairs the City Council's Committee
on Economic Development and Employment, said the city is challenging
HUD's preliminary conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   "The question has come up whether there are disallowed costs for
which the city would be on the hook, [but] that question is still up
in the air," he said. "The city has maintained that the [inspector
general's] original formula for disallowed costs is too stringent. I
think they understand the argument that we made and gave us some
hopeful signs."</TE>
<TE>   Garcetti declined to discuss the amount in question, but other
sources with knowledge of the audit said it was in the millions of
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The findings by auditors for the independent watchdog agency were
contained in a confidential early draft shared with representatives
of the bank and the city and county of Los Angeles last month. Bank
and local government officials have questioned the auditors'
calculations of the disallowed costs, and the auditors have agreed to
review those concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "We had issues regarding the methodologies they used and
conclusions they reached," said Corde Carrillo, director of economic
development for the county's Community Development Commission. Though
the bulk of the bank's money has been spent in the city--which
controls the bank's purse strings and guarantees its funding--10
loans have been made in unincorporated county territory.</TE>
<TE>   The disputed issues center on how job creation figures are counted
and when the requirements must be met, Carrillo said. Bank officials
have asked borrowers to create the jobs within two years but say HUD
regulations don't specify any time limit.</TE>
<TE>   Also at issue is whether job creation is still required if loans
sour and companies are shuttered. The bank has been plagued by early
loans that went bad, including one that ultimately totaled $24
million.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the bank's $430 million in funding is guaranteed by the
city's future federal community development block grants, which the
city could lose if the bank cannot repay its obligations. The audit,
which was due to be released by March 31 but has been delayed, raises
the prospect that losses would have to be covered by the city's
already thin general fund, which is used to pay for such things as
police, parks and libraries.</TE>
<TE>   "In tough budget times we need to use the general fund for core
services ... so any time that we have unexpected costs, it severely
impacts the quality of life for the residents of L.A.," Garcetti
said. "All parties involved are working very hard to make sure
there's responsibility where there needs to be, while at the same
time innocents aren't caught in the cross-fire of [federal]
regulations."</TE>
<TE>   Last Tuesday the City Council voted to reject the bank's annual
business plan, which is required to maintain its funding, triggering
a 60-day negotiation period to determine the institution's future. A
staff report to the council noted that if HUD finds the bank's use of
funds to have been ineligible, "the city may have to reimburse costs
with nonfederal funds."</TE>
<TE>   HUD's Office of Inspector General declined to comment on the audit
before it is made final.</TE>
<TE>   Though the bank's board is appointed by public officials, the bank
is quasi-private and was designed to operate at arm's length from the
city. The bank was created in the wake of the 1992 riots to boost the
economy in poorer neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   According to the most recent bank and city reports, by last summer
the bank had channeled only 11% of the jobs it created to the people
it was designed to serve, rather than the required 51%.</TE>
<TE>   City Administrative Officer William T. Fujioka declined to comment
on the general-fund issue, citing sensitive negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still working out the details, both with the bank and with
the [inspector general]," he said. "This next 60 days are real
critical."</TE>

<HD>Wal-Mart Tops Fortune 500; Enron Rises to Fifth Place</HD>
<DH>Rankings: Discount retailer takes No. 1 spot from Exxon
Mobil. Magazine says bankruptcy filing doesn't disqualify the energy
trader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATT MOORE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the discounter that has become the dominant
force in American retailing, is officially the largest company in the
world, capturing the top spot on the annual Fortune 500 list.</LD>
<LD>   Wal-Mart, No. 2 on the list of top U.S. corporations a year ago,
traded places with oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp. in the rankings
compiled on the basis of revenue. The retailer's ascendancy was
expected after both companies issued their 2001 results this year.</LD>
<LD>   The list, published in the issue of Fortune magazine that reaches
newsstands April 8, had some surprises, most notably the appearance
of Enron Corp., which moved up two notches to No. 5 despite its
downward spiral.</LD>
<TE>   Fortune itself questioned why Enron made the list but noted that
the company benefited from the fact that, like other energy traders,
it was allowed to include trading contracts in its revenue. Other
energy trading firms also advanced in the rankings.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart became the first service company to lead the 500, which
until 1995 was restricted to manufacturing concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart had $219.8 billion in revenue, compared with Exxon
Mobil's $191.6 billion. The only other retailer in the top 20 was
Home Depot Inc., which rose to No. 18 from 23, with revenue of $53.6
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart remained the company with the most employees on the list,
with more than 1.2million workers worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   The list of the largest publicly held companies has been compiled
annually since 1955 by the editors of Fortune. General Motors Corp.,
which had held the top spot on the list for 15 years until 2000,
stayed at No. 3, with revenue of $177.3billion.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Exxon Mobil's slip to No. 2, energy companies fared well
in 2001, with ChevronTexaco Corp. at No. 8, rising from No. 20
because of the merger of Chevron Corp. and Texaco Inc.</TE>
<TE>   American Electric Power Co. shot up to 13 from 146, and Duke
Energy Corp. rose to 14 from 17. El Paso Corp. made it up to 17 from
86, and Reliant Energy Inc. rose to 26 from 55.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy Inc., which backed out of an $8.5-billion merger with
Enron, rose to 30 from 54.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Loomis, a member of Fortune's board of editors, said Enron
made the list because the magazine used Enron's restated earnings
from Jan. 1 to Sept. 30, which gave it revenue of $138.7 billion.
Despite filing for bankruptcy protection Dec.2, the company was
eligible for consideration.</TE>
<TE>   "And that figure is what makes it fifth on our list," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Mergers again lifted some companies, including AOL Time Warner
Inc., which jumped to 37 from 271 because of the combination of Time
Warner and America Online. The company had $38.2billion in revenue,
making it the largest Internet and entertainment company on the
annual list.</TE>
<TE>   Continued woes in the telecommunications industry hurt several
companies' rankings, including Verizon Communications Inc., which
fell to 11 from 10. SBC Communications Inc. dropped to 27 from 14,
and WorldCom Inc. fell 10 spots to 42.</TE>
<TE>   Computer companies were led by IBM Corp., which stayed in the top
10 but fell to ninth place from eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft Corp. rose to 72 from 79, and Cisco Systems Inc., which
makes equipment for the Internet, advanced to 92 from 107 despite
continued slowness in the dot-com market.</TE>
<TE>   The top 10 also included Ford Motor Co. at No. 4, a position it
held last year. General Electric Co. dropped one place to No. 6, and
Citigroup Inc., the largest financial services company in the nation,
fell to No. 7 from No. 6.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Morris Cos. rounded out the top 10 after moving up one spot
from 11.</TE>
<TE>   Total profit for the 500 corporations last year fell 53% to $206
billion. In contrast, 2000 saw an 8.4% increase. The magazine's

<HD>Japan Business Survey Suggests Turnaround Will Be Sluggish</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>The Bank of Japan's closely watched tankan business survey came in
flat for the quarter ended in March, suggesting any turnaround in the
recession-hit economy will be slow.</LD>
<LD>   Pessimists outnumbered optimists as the index of confidence among
large manufacturers held at minus 38, the same as for the quarter
ended in December. Economists expected the index to rise to minus 35.</LD>
<LD>   Confidence among retailers, banks and other
non-manufacturers--which do most of their business within Japan--also
was unchanged at minus 22.</LD>
<TE>   The survey highlights the limitations of Japan's reliance on
exporters to end the recession. Exporters account for just 10% of the
economy, and some, such as NEC Corp., are starting afresh after
posting record losses and cutting tens of thousands of jobs last
year.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the index didn't decline "shows the economy is
bottoming and a pickup is coming," Yasukazu Shimizu, an economist at
Aozora Bank Ltd., told Bloomberg News. "Still, the pace of recovery
is seen as gradual and soft."</TE>
<TE>   But analysts also warn that the outlook for the world's
second-largest economy remains bleak because of rising bankruptcies
and a mountain of corporate and government debt.</TE>
<TE>   Some large manufacturers, such as Fujitsu Ltd., are confident the
worst is over after cleaning house in the last year. The world's
third-biggest maker of memory chips for cell phones, which expects to
have a record $2.85-billion loss in the fiscal year that ended
Sunday, says it will return to profit this year as it reaps the
savings from shedding about 22,000 workers.</TE>
<TE>   Others, such as Sharp Corp., are counting on an increase in sales
to the U.S., which slumped last year as Japan's biggest export market
slid into recession after a record 10-year expansion. Sharp's new
liquid-crystal display panel factory is running at full capacity a
month ahead of schedule to meet rising demand for personal computers.</TE>
<TE>   For companies doing business at home, the outlook is grimmer.</TE>

<HD>Ruling on Microsoft Gives States Optimism</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge's move to review broader evidence in
antitrust case could result in wider sanctions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After days of judicial rebuke and questions about their witnesses'
credibility, the states suing Microsoft Corp. for antitrust
violations rejoiced last week when the presiding judge opened the
door to broader sanctions against the software giant.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly told courtroom lawyers
Tuesday, "I need more factual information" about new technologies
such as TV set-top boxes and hand-held devices to determine whether
antitrust penalties against Microsoft should also cover these items.</LD>
<LD>   Though Kollar-Kotelly reserved the right to later exclude any
evidence, legal experts said the comment has helped boost the states'
case against Microsoft, given the judge's earlier efforts to keep the
trial centered on Microsoft's business tactics in the markets for
Internet Web browsers and computer operating systems.</LD>
<TE>   As the third week of the trial begins today in U.S. District Court
in Washington, legal and industry experts said the states have
regained near-parity with their opponent in what many consider the
biggest antitrust case since the breakup of Standard Oil a century
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The judge's request for information proves that she is at least
listening to the states," said Rob Enderle, a senior technology
analyst for Giga Information Group in Santa Clara, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Decisions by Judge to Have Broad Influence</TE>
<TE>   With at least six more weeks of testimony--including key input
from economists and a possible appearance by Microsoft Chairman Bill
Gates--experts said either side could gain the upper hand in a
dispute that many believe will set important legal precedents and
affect the course of Information Age technology.</TE>
<TE>   Enderle said much of the case and the future of the technology
industry hinges on Kollar-Kotelly's ability to fairly consider the
trial evidence and then order adjustments to Microsoft's behavior to
stimulate competition in the computer software market.</TE>
<TE>   Any broader move "is going to have a big impact on the technology
sector," he said. "The judge has to be careful of the potential
collateral damage."</TE>
<TE>   Little less than a year and a half after a federal court declared
Microsoft an illegal monopoly in June 2000, the Justice Department
and nine states reached a settlement with Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the accord calls for Microsoft to disclose the
technical details of the Windows computer code.</TE>
<TE>   But California, eight other holdout states and the District of
Columbia pressed on with a separate lawsuit seeking tougher
punishment of Microsoft. They said they want to ensure the software
giant wouldn't repeat its anti-competitive conduct in new markets.</TE>
<TE>   "They're saying you can't just stop at the [Web] browser and
[programming language] Java and come up with an effective remedy.
They're telling the judge, 'You have to hear some of this other
evidence,' " said Andy Gavil, an antitrust expert and professor at
Howard University Law School.</TE>
<TE>   The current proceedings have contrasted sharply with the fireworks
that marked the first, no-holds-barred antitrust trial that began
four years ago in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, Jackson gave the green light for marathon broadcasts of
the videotaped deposition of Gates, allowed both sides to introduce
almost any evidence and publicly compared Microsoft executives to
unremorseful gang members and likened Gates to Napoleon.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly has been more circumspect in hopes of avoiding the
kind of higher court rebuke Jackson suffered when the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Washington threw out his breakup order and chastised him
for his disparaging comments about Microsoft officials.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, experts said, the current litigation may turn on how
much evidence Kollar-Kotelly lets in and how much attention she pays
to trial documents that already take up more space than a dozen
big-city phone books.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, her willingness to allow testimony about a broad
range of new technologies may mean that she is willing to consider
more draconian remedy proposals, such as forcing Microsoft to license
its source code to outside software developers, said University of
Baltimore antitrust professor Robert H. Lande.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Banning of Evidence Appears to Be Justified</TE>
<TE>   The jurist appears determined to slog through the thousands of
pages of documentary evidence that have been submitted so far. She
recently complained about the late hours she's been keeping and
wondered aloud whether she could keep it up.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been here until 10 or 11 every night reading testimony and
trying to decide if it fits your theory," she told a lawyer for the
states during the first week of the trial.</TE>
<TE>   Although Kollar-Kotelly has excluded portions of the states'
evidence, the banished evidence has been limited, and experts said
the judge appears to be on strong legal ground for excluding it.</TE>
<TE>   "She can [almost] never make a mistake by listening to evidence
and then excluding" things that aren't germane, said Ernest Gellhorn,
an antitrust expert and law professor at George Mason University in
Fairfax, Va. "By doing that, she avoids doing something that Judge
Jackson did in the previous proceedings that brought him the wrath of
the appeals court, and that is terminating the antitrust process
prematurely."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Prior Ruling May Pose a Problem</TE>
<TE>   The government's former star, trial lawyer David Boies, said he
agreed with Kollar-Kotelly's ban on some evidence during the trial on
grounds that it was hearsay.</TE>
<TE>   But Boies, who briefly sat in on the Microsoft proceedings last
month before heading off to another case, said the judge's early
efforts to discourage discussion of Microsoft's conduct on emerging
technologies such as hand-held computers could prove more
problematic.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little concerned about what's happening to my case," he
said jokingly.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft has submitted a request that Kollar-Kotelly reject any
evidence regarding products and markets not related to PC operating
systems such as hand-held devices, TV set-top boxes and Web services.</TE>
<TE>   The software giant also has asked that the judge exclude any
evidence of alleged abuses before the first antitrust case or after
the final judgment was handed down in June 2000. Kollar-Kotelly said
she would rule on Microsoft's motion later in the trial.</TE>
<TE>   The states want the judge to order Microsoft to offer a modular
version of Windows so consumers and PC makers would have the option
of replacing Microsoft browsers, media players and other products
with those from competitors such as AOL Time Warner Inc. and
RealNetworks Inc.</TE>
<TE>   With Kollar-Kotelly choosing to listen to such evidence, the
states think their chance of securing a stronger remedy has improved.</TE>
<TE>   The decision, said Tom Greene, a senior lawyer in the California
attorney general's office, "will allow us to provide the judge all of
our evidence.... The strategy that Microsoft was pursuing was to
preclude us from bringing in that evidence. This now means we can at
least tell our story."</TE>

<HD>Japanese Builder Files Bankruptcy</HD>
<DH>Contractor: Nissan Construction abandons restructuring
plans and applies for protection from creditors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Japan's Nissan Construction Co. applied for bankruptcy protection
from its creditors, abandoning plans to rehabilitate itself
financially.</LD>
<LD>   The company, listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, has liabilities
amounting to about $865 million, Nissan Construction President
Takeshi Fujita told reporters Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "We explored the possibility of revival through a corporate
tie-up, but our financial position was too weak," said Fujita, who
resigned Sunday along with the company's eight other directors.</LD>
<TE>   Nissan Construction, 48% owned by failed supermarket operator
Mycal, has close business relations with heavy machinery and
engineering company Hitachi Zosen Corp. as well as Nissan Motor Co.</TE>
<TE>   Mycal, Japan's fourth-biggest supermarket chain, filed for court
protection from creditors in September after its main bank cut off
funding.</TE>
<TE>   Mycal's failure hit Nissan Construction hard because the
supermarket operator had owed the builder about $90million, Fujita
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Nissan Construction bankruptcy filing is the second in a month
by a Japanese construction company. In early March, builder Sato
Kogyo filed for court protection, with debts estimated at
$3.76billion.</TE>
<TE>   Public fears have been growing over high-profile bankruptcies.
Last year, construction company Aoki Corp. went under. In January,
home builder Shokusan Jutaku Sogo Co. filed for protection from
creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Many builders have suffered a decline in orders since Prime
Minister Junichiro Koizumi swept to power vowing to end pork barrel
spending on highways and other construction projects. Spending under
previous leaders had made Japan's debt the highest in the
industrialized world at about $5.4 trillion, equivalent to 130% of
gross domestic product.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan Construction announced a restructuring plan in May followed
by another in November, but falling demand combined with a freeze on
many public works projects forced it to file for bankruptcy, it said.</TE>

<HD>Travel Advisors' Business Thrives</HD>
<DH>Security: Intelligence services have seen demand rise since
Sept. 11, offering updates on dangers abroad, but some firms may take
their job too far.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM KRANE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>For Americans who travel abroad, the world looks like a more menacing
place.</LD>
<LD>   Since Sept. 11, a swarm of travel intelligence services and
executive tracking programs have emerged, capitalizing on the fear of
things foreign. Most aim to inform business junketeers about the
potential for disease, delays and danger.</LD>
<LD>   Business, they say, has been vigorous.</LD>
<TE>   "We're adding double the number of clients per month than we were
before Sept. 11," said Tim Daniel, chief operating officer of
International SOS Assistance Inc. "There's a real desire to find out
what the heck is going on."</TE>
<TE>   International SOS, based in Philadelphia and London, had mainly
been known as the company that evacuates executives from war zones.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the company e-mails clients daily "situation updates" and
offers a locator service to track business travelers as they trot the
globe.</TE>
<TE>   A new company called IJet Travel Intelligence--formed by former
American, British, South African and Russian intelligence
officers--touts a computer network based on the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency's.</TE>
<TE>   Like the CIA, the Annapolis, Md.-based company monitors thousands
of information sources for hints of future mayhem, said Rick Lurie,
IJet's vice president for intelligence operations.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, the company warned travelers to South Africa to
expect violent demonstrations during a United Nations conference on
race. Demonstrations occurred, but were mostly peaceful.</TE>
<TE>   "We told people weeks in advance," said Lurie, who used to work at
the U.S. National Security Agency. "The State Department reported its
warning the day of the conference."</TE>
<TE>   Has the world really grown more dangerous?</TE>
<TE>   "That's probably fair to say," said State Department spokesman
Edward Dickens. "In certain places, under certain circumstances,
Americans are a particular target. But it was dangerous in places and
at times before Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   But Kevin Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition,
which advocates travel-friendly public policy, said the U.S.
government and security companies have a "vested interest" in warning
Americans of risks abroad, even if that means erring on the side of
caution.</TE>
<TE>   The world "isn't more dangerous if you look at it from a
statistical standpoint," Mitchell said.</TE>
<TE>   For security companies, warning Americans is more than a vested
interest. It's a livelihood.</TE>
<TE>   Some may take their job too far. For instance, IJet's Lurie
described Spain, whose streets are arguably safer than those in the
United States, as a "terrorist hotbed."</TE>
<TE>   Spain does suffer occasional bombings by Basque insurgents. But
few consider the country unsafe. The State Department says the 1
million yearly American visitors haven't been targeted, but should
still watch out--mainly for pickpockets.</TE>
<TE>   In most countries, the situation is similar. Corporate espionage,
street crime and traffic wrecks are bigger worries, said Thomas
Nulty, president of Navigant International, a corporate travel
management company.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers may be better off directly calling the State Department
desk for the appropriate country to get free information, some
security experts say.</TE>

<HD>Russia Agrees to Remove Poultry Ban</HD>
<DH>Trade: In return, U.S. will crack down on unsanitary plants
and fake veterinary papers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN IAMS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Russia agreed Sunday to lift a ban on poultry imports from the United
States, resolving a dispute that had clouded economic relations, the
U.S. ambassador said.</LD>
<LD>   In exchange, the United States agreed to adopt tougher controls on
veterinary documents and measures against companies that exported
salmonella-tainted chicken, U.S. Ambassador Alexander Vershbow said.
There was no immediate comment from the Russian side.</LD>
<LD>   Russia imposed the ban last month, citing concerns about sanitary
conditions in U.S. plants and the use of antibiotics and feed
additives in American chickens. U.S. officials said the ban was not
justified scientifically, and accused Moscow of protectionism.</LD>
<TE>   Vershbow said he and Russia's chief veterinary inspector, Mikhail
Kravchuk, signed a protocol Sunday on the ban, and it would be lifted
before April 10 after the United States meets requirements set by
Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Chicken is the top American export to Russia, bringing in
$600million to $700 million a year to producers in 38 U.S. states.</TE>
<TE>   Vershbow told a news conference that the issue of poultry imports
had become the No. 1 problem in U.S.-Russian relations last month.</TE>
<TE>   "This dispute has caused some harm to bilateral economic
relations," Vershbow said. "That's undeniable."</TE>
<TE>   The ban--along with recent U.S. sanctions on foreign steel, a
major Russian export--had clouded relations ahead of President Bush's
visit to Russia on May 23.</TE>
<TE>   "With the visit of Bush two months away, there is a need to expand
our cooperation, and it appears that this [poultry dispute] obstacle
has been removed," Vershbow said.</TE>
<TE>   He said there were two central issues in the dispute: discovery of
salmonella in some imported poultry and irregularities, including
forgery, in veterinary documents.</TE>
<TE>   "After the U.S. side fully complies with the actions ... the
Russian veterinary service will lift the temporary ban on U.S.
poultry meat exports," the protocol said.</TE>
<TE>   The United States agreed to exclude 14 American poultry producers
temporarily from the list of approved exporters after their products
were found to contain salmonella.</TE>
<TE>   It also will use veterinary certificate forms with security
features aimed at preventing forgery.</TE>
<TE>   Vershbow said that in the talks, there was no evidence that
American poultry shipments deviated from a 1996 agreement on health
standards, and "we have heard of no cases where any poultry products
have caused any harm to the Russian consumer."</TE>
<TE>   "When the ban is lifted, all other U.S. companies will be able to
resume trade, and hopefully the other [14 excluded] plants will soon
be reinstated," Vershbow said.</TE>
<TE>   Vershbow complained that Russia had fostered negative publicity
about the safety of American food exports, tactics that he said could
complicate Russia's desire to join the World Trade Organization.</TE>
<TE>   "The handling of this dispute has been very much at variance with
the kind of rules of the game that WTO members are expected to
observe," he said.</TE>

<LD>Fresh Economic Data  to Launch 2nd Quarter</LD>
<LD>   Reports this week on the nation's employment picture and data on
manufacturing could boost Wall Street's taste for U.S. equities and
help offset worries of higher oil prices and inflation in the face of
Middle East violence.</LD>
<LD>   The earnings season, when companies report quarterly profits and
revenues, heats up next week. Until then, investors have little in
the way of fundamental signals to guide stock purchases or sales. And
reports of more violence in Israel are unlikely to shake investors
into making big bets on stocks, fund managers say.</LD>
<TE>   The second quarter of 2002 begins today with a trickle of
first-quarter earnings reports. Companies expected to report include
home-products retailers Best Buy Co. and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. Among
the 30 companies whose stocks make up the blue-chip Dow Jones
industrial average, the first to report earnings will be Alcoa Inc.,
the world's No. 1 aluminum producer, which issues its numbers Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The week will bring a slew of fresh economic data.</TE>
<TE>   * Today, the Institute for Supply Management issues its gauge of
the U.S. manufacturing sector, which it calculates from order,
production and inventory data.</TE>
<TE>   * Today, a report on construction spending during February from
the Commerce Department is likely to show that the building of homes
and commercial structures is robust.</TE>
<TE>   * Tuesday, the Commerce Department will report on manufacturers'
orders in February.</TE>
<TE>   * Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management issues data on
the non-manufacturing sector.</TE>
<TE>   * Friday, the Labor Department issues its nonfarm payrolls report,

March from 5.5% in February. A higher-than-expected jobless rate may
slow the economic recovery.</TE>

<TE>   Argentina Hopes for Aid Package After IMF Visit</TE>
<TE>   Easter may have brought a welcome lull to Argentina's smoldering
social tensions, but a visit by an International Monetary Fund
contingent this week could make or break a government desperate for
billions of dollars in aid.</TE>
<TE>   Daily protests of everything from deepening poverty to economic
policy thinned as thousands of Argentines headed out of town for the
five-day public holiday. Police reported only a handful of isolated,
small-scale shop robberies and looting incidents.</TE>
<TE>   But amid fears that unrest could flare into repeat scenes of the
bloody rioting and pillaging that toppled the elected government late
last year and left 27 dead, President Eduardo Duhalde faces a race
against time to win international aid.</TE>
<TE>   The IMF has hinted that aid could be around the corner if all goes
well in negotiations with officials due to arrive in Argentina today.
Argentina hopes the IMF will front a multibillion-dollar aid package
to help end its grinding four-year recession.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde must restore confidence among international lenders and
investors alike and contain the fears of a public that continues to
scramble to seek refuge from the depressed peso--raising the specter
of a return to Argentina's hyperinflationary past.</TE>
<TE>   Vice Economy Minister Jorge Todesca had said the government
intended to raise export taxes on commodities, agricultural oils and
flour to about 20% to help rake in an additional $1.2 billion to
offset a sharp slump in tax revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Investors, awaiting word on promised economic measures from the
government, also will be looking to see if the central bank manages
to stem the slide of the peso when local foreign exchange and stock
markets resume trading Tuesday.</TE>

<TE>   Boeing, Air Force in Talks on Leasing 767s</TE>
<TE>   Boeing Co., the No. 2 defense contractor, is beginning
negotiations to lease as many as 100 767 passenger jets to the U.S.
Air Force.</TE>
<TE>   The jets will be converted to aerial refueling vehicles. Analysts
estimate the potential value of the contract at $26 billion, though
the company is offering to provide the aircraft for less than that,
said Paul Guse, a company spokesman. Talks are to begin immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago-based Boeing is counting on the leases to help it weather
a decline in its commercial aircraft business. The company said the
airline slump brought about by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks cost it
almost $700 million in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Congress authorized the lease of the Boeing planes last year as a
cost-effective way for the Air Force to replace its aging fleet of
KC-135 tanker planes.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force solicited other proposals after EADS, a parent
company of Airbus, objected. The Air Force later rejected an EADS
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington Post reported last week that the Air Force chose
Boeing because of Airbus' lack of experience in building tanker
aircraft. Airbus, which is based in France, is the No. 2 plane maker.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Boeing, the largest plane maker, rose 92 cents to $48.25
on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. U.S. markets were closed
Friday.</TE>

<HD>Boeing, Air Force in Talks on Leasing 767s</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boeing Co., the No. 2 defense contractor, is beginning negotiations
to lease as many as 100 767 passenger jets to the U.S. Air Force.</LD>
<LD>   The jets will be converted to aerial refueling vehicles. Analysts
estimate the potential value of the contract at $26 billion, though
the company is offering to provide the aircraft for less than that,
said Paul Guse, a company spokesman. Talks are to begin immediately.</LD>
<LD>   Chicago-based Boeing is counting on the leases to help it weather
a decline in its commercial aircraft business. The company said the
airline slump brought about by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks cost it
almost $700 million in the fourth quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Congress authorized the lease of the Boeing planes last year as a
cost-effective way for the Air Force to replace its aging fleet of
KC-135 tanker planes.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force solicited other proposals after EADS, a parent
company of Airbus, objected. The Air Force later rejected an EADS
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington Post reported last week that the Air Force chose
Boeing because of Airbus' lack of experience in building tanker
aircraft. Airbus, which is based in France, is the No. 2 plane maker.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Boeing, the largest plane maker, rose 92 cents to $48.25
on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. U.S. markets were closed
Friday.</TE>

<HD>Viacom CEO Redstone Is Down but Not Out</HD>
<DH>Media: Injury forces mogul to cancel China trip, but he is
'feeling great' and still working.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAUDIA ELLER and SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Media mogul Sumner Redstone was supposed to be in China this week,
meeting with President Jiang Zemin about expanding the reach of his
company's MTV and Nickelodeon cable networks.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Redstone, the 78-year-old chairman and chief executive of
Viacom Inc., is in Los Angeles recuperating from two broken ribs and
a collapsed lung after slipping on the bathroom floor of his
Manhattan apartment.</LD>
<LD>   "They can't kill me! Anyone who wants to get rid of me, forget
it," Redstone joked during a chat in the presidential suite at the
tony Hotel Bel-Air.</LD>
<TE>   Redstone, who in late February had three liters of blood drained
around a punctured lung, said he was now "feeling great," although he
had grudgingly taken his doctor's advice not to travel abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "I hated to say no," said Redstone, who was looking forward to a
follow-up visit to China.</TE>
<TE>   In March 2001, Redstone was in Beijing to sign a three-year deal
to launch Nickelodeon in 40 million Chinese homes. "Today that number
is 85 million," Redstone said.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom's first channel to reach China was MTV in the late '90s.
MTV is now seen in 85 million Chinese households, Redstone said, up
from 52 million a year ago. Because China has 300 million TV-watching
households--three times the number in the U.S.--he believes that the
Chinese market has huge commercial potential.</TE>
<TE>   Although Redstone says he was in extreme pain after his fall, the
next night he traveled to the White House as planned for a screening
of Viacom's new Mel Gibson film, "We Were Soldiers." Among the guests
were Gibson, Viacom Entertainment Group Chairman Jonathan Dolgen,
Viacom President Mel Karmazin and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-February, Powell appeared on MTV to talk about various
subjects as part of Hollywood's effort to support the Bush
administration's war on terrorism. In November, Redstone had
suggested that Powell appear on MTV at a meeting in Beverly Hills
with top entertainment executives and President Bush's chief
political advisor, Karl Rove. MTV chief Tom Freston then arranged the
Powell broadcast, Redstone said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts speculate that Freston could be part of a management
troika--including Dolgen and Leslie Moonves, head of Viacom's CBS
Network--that may run Viacom if Karmazin leaves when his contract
expires at the end of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Redstone and Karmazin have had a clash of egos since Viacom bought
CBS two years ago. Karmazin was chief executive of CBS, and he has
operating control of Viacom until his contract expires. In January,
Viacom's board ordered Redstone and Karmazin to reconcile their
differences in the interest of the company.</TE>
<TE>   "Mel and I have agreed that this year we will be focused entirely
on driving the company's business and driving the stock, and we will
not discuss the future until the end of the year," said Redstone, who
refused to say more on the subject.</TE>
<TE>   Another executive who has received more attention recently is his
daughter Shari Redstone, 47, who sits on Viacom's board and runs its
closely held parent company, Boston-based theater circuit National
Amusements Inc. When asked what future role she might play, Redstone
said, "She will be more involved in the business affairs of the
company."</TE>
<TE>   Redstone praised his daughter's management skills. National
Amusements has remained healthy while most of its major theater chain
rivals have filed for bankruptcy protection after a period of
overbuilding massive multiscreen theaters.</TE>
<TE>   That said, Redstone insisted, his daughter will not run Viacom.</TE>
<TE>   "She is not interested, nor am I, in her being CEO of Viacom," he
said. "I believe in professional management, not family."</TE>
<TE>   Why are the two mutually exclusive?</TE>
<TE>   "That's an interesting question," Redstone said.</TE>

<HD>Return Overpayment of Severance? It Depends</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: After I was laid off, the company sent my last paycheck and
a severance check.</LD>
<LD>   I cashed the checks, paid some bills and bought some extra
Christmas presents because of the severance check. Now the company
says there was a mistake and is asking me to return some money.</LD>
<LD>   I feel very bad that I spent that money, but I thought it was
mine. Do I have any option?</LD>
<TE>   --G.S., Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   Answer: If you received more severance pay than you were clearly
entitled to receive under the terms of a severance agreement or
company severance policy, a court probably would require you to
return the extra money.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, if the severance payment was purely
discretionary on the part of your employer and not such a large
amount that a reasonable person would conclude that there was an
obvious mistake, you would have a good argument for keeping the extra
money.</TE>

<TE>   City Isn't Exempt From Overtime Laws</TE>
<TE>   Q: I worked part time for a city government from 1979 to 2000. I
usually was assigned to special events, which meant working long
hours and some holidays.</TE>
<TE>   A reliable source told me at the time that the city was exempt
from paying extra for overtime and holidays. Is this true? If not,
can I still collect? How?</TE>
<TE>   --P.C., Fontana</TE>
<TE>   A: I'm not aware of a city government exemption from overtime
laws.</TE>
<TE>   There are some exceptions to the overtime rules for certain
industries. For example, overtime rules might be different if you
worked at a hospital owned by a city.</TE>
<TE>   It's also possible that the city, rather than considering itself
exempt from overtime rules, may simply view your particular job as
exempt because of the duties you perform.</TE>
<TE>   If you are considered a manager, for example, you might be exempt.
If you are not exempt, you would be entitled to overtime if you
worked more than eight hours a day or 40 hours a week.</TE>
<TE>   Employers are not required by law to give you holiday pay,
however. Indeed, many employers exclude part-time workers from
holiday pay.</TE>
<TE>   Employers can decide to give holiday pay to some employees while
denying it to others, as long as it is not on a discriminatory basis.</TE>
<TE>   If you think you have a claim for overtime or holiday pay, you can
contact the California Labor Commissioner's Division of Labor
Standards Enforcement. It will investigate your claim free and put
pressure on the employer to pay any obligations. You also have the
option of contacting an attorney.</TE>

<TE>   Sick Leave Can Be Used to Care for Family</TE>
<TE>   Q: I recently discovered a California law stating that employers
must allow parents to use their own sick leave to care for a sick
child.</TE>
<TE>   My employer, a large company, is saying that this California code
does not apply because we don't have "accrued sick leave." Instead,
each employee is given a set number of days during a set time period
to be used for both short-term and long-term illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   My previous managers always allowed employees to use sick leave
while a child is ill, yet my current manager is insisting those
managers were wrong.</TE>
<TE>   --J.F., Garden Grove</TE>
<TE>   A: California Labor Code Section 233 stipulates that any employer
providing sick leave to employees must permit them to use it to
attend to the illness of a child, parent, spouse or domestic partner.</TE>
<TE>   An employee would be entitled to use the number of sick days that
would accrue during six months of employment.</TE>
<TE>   Sick leave is defined as an absence for any of the following
reasons:</TE>
<TE>   * The employee is physically or mentally unable to perform his or
her duties due to illness, injury or a medical condition.</TE>
<TE>   * The absence is to obtain professional diagnosis or treatment for
the employee's medical condition.</TE>
<TE>   * The absence is for other medical reasons, such as pregnancy or
obtaining a physical examination.</TE>
<TE>   The type of leave you described should fall within this
definition, and you should be permitted to use your accrued time to
care for your child.</TE>
<TE>   If not, I suggest you contact the head of human resources at your
company and cite the appropriate section of the code. If your
employer continues to deny you the time off, you may file a claim
with the labor commissioner's office.</TE>
<TE>   If you are successful, your employer will be required to provide
you with the paid time off.</TE>
<TE>   You have another option--filing a civil lawsuit in Superior Court
to recover any wages that you lost from taking time off without pay
or from termination for attempting to use your time off to be with
your child. The court also has the authority to award reasonable
attorneys' fees.</TE>

<HD>Japan Hopes World Cup Will Give Economy a Kick</HD>
<DH>Sports: The nation, in a slump, will co-host the soccer
event with South Korea. Analysts expect a boost from visitors, but it
may be short-lived.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>YONGGI KANG</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a country where unemployment is near record levels after a
decade-long economic slump, people tend to think twice before opening
up their wallets and going on a spending spree.</LD>
<LD>   But that could change, at least for a while, when Japan and South
Korea co-host the monthlong World Cup soccer championships starting
May 31.</LD>
<LD>   "The World Cup is just about the only bright light we see ahead
that will spur consumer spending in Japan," said Shuji Shirota, an
economist at securities house Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.</LD>
<TE>   Akiyoshi Takumori, economist at Sakura Investment Management, said
that after France hosted the World Cup in 1998, the country's economy
grew 3.3%--its highest rate of the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Brokers' "to-buy" lists are getting longer as they add the
sporting goods manufacturers, the media, breweries, consumer
electronics manufacturers, security companies and even cosmetics
firms.</TE>
<TE>   HSBC Securities strategist Garry Evans studied the correlation
between the World Cup and each host country's stock market and found
that most bourses posted strong gains in the run-up to the
competition.</TE>
<TE>   "In France in 1998, for example, the CAC-40 [stock index] rose 39%
in the first half of the year and outperformed global equity markets
by 22%," Evans said in a report to clients issued in December.</TE>
<TE>   And, apart from the more obvious stock buys, such as TV
manufacturers and breweries, Evans also advises that investors put
money into sectors such as cosmetics.</TE>
<TE>   "[Soccer] souvenirs will obviously sell well, but so may cosmetics
and perfume as men with a guilty conscience for having left wives and
girlfriends at home buy them as gifts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Two private think tanks, Dentsu Institute for Human Studies and
the Institute for Social Engineering, have estimated that the World
Cup will bring in $13 billion even in the worst-case scenario--if the
Japan team fails to make it through the first stage of competition.</TE>
<TE>   With Japan's total output at about $3.8 trillion per year, that
additional spending would increase growth in the country's gross
domestic product, the broadest gauge of the economy's health, by more
than 0.3 percentage point.</TE>
<TE>   The latest data show Japan's recession deepened in the final
quarter of 2001, with the country's GDP shrinking 1.2% as business
investment logged its biggest quarterly decrease on record.</TE>
<TE>   Hitoshi Sakai, chief executive at the Institute for Social
Engineering, said he plans to revise his forecasts up because they
don't factor in the effect of cultural exchanges between Japan and
South Korea, which are also expected to stimulate spending.</TE>
<TE>   But, despite the optimism, other economists remain skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "I do reckon the World Cup will have some positive impact, but
people should not get their hopes too high," said Kazuhiko Ogata,
senior economist at HSBC Securities. "When Japan hosted the Nagano
Olympic Games in 1998, it didn't have a significant impact on the
economy. And the environment is strikingly similar now, as Japan was
in the midst of a financial crisis back then."</TE>
<TE>   Spending by foreign visitors, which will be counted as part of
Japan's GDP, could boost consumption. The Transport Ministry
estimates 365,000 people will visit Japan during the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   But Ogata noted that, according to Finance Ministry data, when
Japan hosted the Nagano Games in February 1998, spending by foreign
visitors that month actually fell 4.3% compared with that month the
previous year.</TE>
<TE>   And even if the World Cup does stimulate the moribund economy,
analysts question whether the effect will last long.</TE>
<TE>   "Personal consumption in the April-June quarter will be good, but
what's important is how it performs in the following quarter when the
economy is seen hitting a cyclical bottom," said Shirota of Dresdner
Kleinwort Wasserstein.</TE>
<TE>   Sakura Investment's Takumori warned that local businesses should
do their share in trying to encourage the Japanese people and foreign
visitors to spend more.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy could slip back into negative territory if people
just sit back idly," he said, adding that tourist resorts, for
example, should think of ways to become more welcoming to foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, there's the question of how Japan--rated 66-to-1
to win the World Cup by British bookmaker Ladbrokes--will perform in
the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese electronics makers and retailers expected sales of
audiovisual goods, such as flat-screen televisions, to pick up in the
country because of the Olympics in Salt Lake City. But those hopes
were dashed, partly because of Japan's poor performance. Its athletes
won only two medals, compared with 10 at the Nagano Games.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, if Japan becomes the World Cup champion, that would
definitely brighten sentiment, but that's too much to ask," Shirota
said.</TE>
<TE>   And Evans at HSBC Securities warns that the stock market could
fall quite sharply after the World Cup, as previous patterns have
suggested.</TE>
<TE>   But Japan, desperately seeking a catalyst to jump-start the
economy, is looking beyond what the World Cup may do to help get it
back on its feet.</TE>
<TE>   Yokohama, host of the championship match and Japan's
second-biggest city, thinks the contest will raise its relatively low
profile abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope that those who stay in one of Yokohama's hotels and visit
our tourist spots will return to their homelands and be our
messengers," said Koichi Hayashi, manager of the city's planning
bureau.</TE>

<HD>State Spam Laws Rarely Enforced</HD>
<DH>Internet: It's difficult to track down senders on the Web,
and prosecutors are busy with other crimes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone cleaning out a bulging e-mail in box probably has wished for a
law regulating spam, the unsolicited electronic messages that promise
instant weight loss, overnight riches and triple-X pictures.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty states, including California, have laws governing the
distribution of commercial e-mail to individuals and companies.
Violations can lead to fines and even jail time.</LD>
<LD>   But the laws almost never are enforced.</LD>
<TE>   No one has been prosecuted under California's 4-year-old anti-spam
law. It's the same in Delaware, which has one of the toughest laws in
the country--at least on paper.</TE>
<TE>   Only in the state of Washington has an attorney general filed a
case.</TE>
<TE>   "Anti-spam laws are, at best, a partial solution," said law
professor David Sorkin of John Marshall Law School in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   His Web site, at www.spamlaws.com, posts information about spam
laws and cases.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem is that the anonymous nature of the Internet
makes it difficult to track down those who send illegal messages. And
few attorneys general or district attorneys are willing to spend the
time and money necessary to match message to mailer, particularly
when overloaded with murders, rapes and other violent crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "Out of sympathy to them, I'm sure they have other things on their
docket that need to be taken care of," said Tom Geller, executive
director of the anti-spam SpamCon Foundation. "But if they want a
case that will please the citizenry, I would urge them to raise the
priority of spam prosecutions."</TE>
<TE>   Spam costs consumers an estimated $8.8 billion a year worldwide
just in connection costs, according to a 2001 survey by the European
Commission, which initiates policies for the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer complaints fueled the passage of California's 1998 spam
law, which requires unsolicited commercial e-mail to begin its
subject line with ADV or ADV:ADLT if the message is of a sexual
nature. Filters on e-mail programs can be set to detect those
characters and delete the messages before they appear in an in box.</TE>
<TE>   The law, upheld last year by the state Court of Appeal, also
requires that spam include a valid e-mail address or toll-free number
that a recipient can use to get off a bulk e-mail list.</TE>
<TE>   No law enforcement agency has taken action, however. Atty. Gen.
Bill Lockyer said his office held off because district attorneys
usually get the first shot at bringing cases under a new law.</TE>
<TE>   But representatives of the Los Angeles County district attorney's
office said they are caught in a Catch-22 when it comes to bringing
criminal charges under the law as written.</TE>
<TE>   "To file a case, we would need to be able to examine the logs of
an Internet service provider to prove who had sent the spam," said
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jonathan Fairtlough, with the department's
high-tech crimes unit.</TE>
<TE>   That would require a search warrant or a subpoena, neither of
which can be obtained unless charges are filed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Civil cases also could be brought, but the Los Angeles County
department that would initiate them--the district attorney's Consumer
Protection Division--said it has not received an actionable complaint
from consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "Being that the Internet is a global institution, the consumer who
has gotten an e-mail from somewhere in the world does not think to
call the local D.A.," said Tom Papageorge, deputy district attorney
in charge of the division. "The average consumer just hits delete
rather than making a copy of the e-mail, filling out a complaint and
getting it to the local authorities."</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer said that in lieu of actions by district attorneys, his
office may get involved. He has a team of lawyers studying the issue
to determine whether they could successfully prosecute under the 1998
law.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hopeful it will only be a matter of weeks before we can come
to some kind of conclusion," Lockyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Delaware has the strongest spam law in the country, banning
unsolicited commercial e-mail outright. Under the 1999 law, the only
way to legally send a state resident a commercial e-mail is to have
his or her permission beforehand.</TE>
<TE>   "There were so many consumer complaints that we wanted the
strongest law possible," said the state's attorney general, Jane
Brady. But there have been no prosecutions. "I have told my staff
that I'm really losing patience, but it's a very difficult process,"
Brady said.</TE>
<TE>   The difficulty in upholding these laws is not a lack of spam. Of
the billions of e-mails that arrive each month at Atlanta-based
EarthLink Inc., one of the world's largest Internet service
providers, as much as 25% is spam, a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   The problem, Brady and other law enforcement officials say, is
determining who sent an illegal spam.</TE>
<TE>   Spammers started using various tactics to stay anonymous in the
mid-1990s, when junk e-mail became a popular commercial ploy.</TE>
<TE>   At first, they altered the "From" line of their messages to make
it look as if it was sent by someone else. By 1997, more
sophisticated spammers were routing their bulk e-mails through
unsuspecting ISPs to hide the messages' true origins. The technique,
which makes tracing more difficult, was called hijacking an open
relay.</TE>
<TE>   ISPs struck back by installing equipment on their mail servers to
prevent hijacking. The spammers then found ways to search
electronically around the world for unprotected servers.</TE>
<TE>   "They would use software to look for relays that could be hijacked
and then just send a few e-mails through each," Internet security
consultant Steve Atkins said. "It became an arms race between
spammers and the people trying to shut them down."</TE>
<TE>   The spammers are winning, mostly because of the vast number of
unprotected mail servers, especially in countries relatively new to
the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, some major ISPs--including UXN in Europe--have taken the
drastic step of blocking all e-mails that come from China because of
that country's high number of unprotected servers.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the attorney general's office took action soon
after that state's law was ratified in 1998. "We had gotten a lot of
complaints not only from residents but also from Internet service
providers who said that spam was costing them a lot of money to deal
with," senior counsel Paula Selis said.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general filed a civil suit against Oregon resident
Jason Heckel, who allegedly was selling his booklet "How to Profit
From the Internet" through spam. "His deal was that he was selling
something that told people how to set up their own spam business.
Kind of ironic for our first case," Selis said.</TE>
<TE>   Heckel challenged the constitutionality of the law, but it was
upheld last year by the state's Supreme Court. Now the case is
scheduled to return to court in September. If Heckel is convicted, he
could be fined as much as $500 for each spam.</TE>
<TE>   With officials not prosecuting in California, private individuals
and firms have attempted to take civil actions on their own. This can
be done under the California law, although the biggest penalty the
law allows for a private suit is an injunction to stop the spam.</TE>
<TE>   Only one private case has made it to a Superior Court. It was
brought in Sonoma County two years ago by Mark Ferguson against a
matchmaking site, Friendfinder.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson said he was getting 200 spams a day. When he asked
spammers to stop, they sent even more. "The spammers were just
flaunting it," he said. "It was like, 'Ha, ha, you can't catch us.' "</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson, 39, began spending part of every day trying to battle
spammers, a tradition he kept up even after his Web design business
declined because of the tech downturn and he took an appliance
delivery job.In 1999, Ferguson chose the Palo Alto-based Friendfinder
as the target of a class-action suit because it seemed to be a highly
successful operation.</TE>
<TE>   "I was doing this to make a point," Ferguson said. "If they can't
afford to fight, what good does it do?"</TE>
<TE>   He also wanted a company that could pay a sizable settlement to
him, the lawyers and anyone who joins the class action. Ferguson is
attempting to go beyond the relief stipulated by the anti-spam law by
alleging that handling spam wears down and causes physical damage to
home computers.</TE>
<TE>   The case first went to a Superior Court, where a judge dismissed
it, saying that the law was unconstitutional because it violated
interstate commerce freedoms.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the state Court of Appeal rejected the decision,
affirming the constitutionality of the law.</TE>
<TE>   Friendfinder has asked the state Supreme Court to consider the
case. If the court declines or upholds the appellate court decision,
Ferguson will be able to pursue his case.</TE>
<TE>   Friendfinder owner Andrew Conru, who founded the Palo Alto-based
company in 1996, said the firm has never sent an unsolicited
commercial e-mail. "Spammers are just bad businesspeople," Conru
said.</TE>
<TE>   Friendfinder has been vilified in anti-spam newsgroups by people
who said they have received numerous spams advertising the site.
Conru said these were sent out mostly by members of the company's
affiliate program, which pays a referral fee for every paid
subscriber brought in.</TE>
<TE>   Another private suit was filed last month by California's largest
law firm, Morrison &amp; Foerster. It alleges that bulk e-mailer Etracks
sent 6,500 illegal spams to employees and others who use the law
firm's e-mail accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The law firm also is claiming damages because Etracks allegedly
used the Morrison &amp; Foerster mail server to distribute the e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   Etracks--a Belmont, Calif., firm that distributes bulk e-mail for
numerous companies--did not respond to a request for comment on the
suit.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, spam is a part of everyday life for computer
users.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with spam is that it is the tragedy of the common,"
SpamCon's Geller said.</TE>
<TE>   "Millions of people feel damaged very slightly. In order to gain
true redress, you have to coordinate these millions to give power to
an individual. That's not easy to do."</TE>

<HD>Families Rev Up Travel Plans</HD>
<DH>Summer RV, campsite reservations soar. Patriotism may play
role.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thinking others might have the same idea for a summer vacation this
year, Douglas Christ reserved a 32-foot recreational vehicle for his
family--back in December. But when he tried to book a campsite at
Yosemite National Park for a June vacation, Christ was told he was
too late.</LD>
<LD>   "They were full, and I called the very first day they started
taking reservations for summer," said Christ, of Irvine. "We did
finally find something, but it was outside the park. So much for
planning ahead."</LD>
<LD>   Whether because of convenience or comfort, security or newfound
patriotism, the country's highways and campgrounds promise to be
jammed this summer as families pile into RVs in record numbers and
descend on national parks and monuments. Summer rentals of RVs are up
40% over last year, according to the Recreational Vehicle Industry
Assn.</LD>
<TE>   Likewise, the National Assn. of RV Parks and Campgrounds, the
trade group representing commercial sites, says reservations are
running 46% over last year for June, July and August. What's more, at
least half of the summer reservations are coming from people who
never have been camping before, said group President Linda Profaizer.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, we're in store for a 'see America' summer," she said.
"Families want to go, and [traveling in an RV and camping] seem safe,
secure and intimate."</TE>
<TE>   Summer travel otherwise is shaping up to be a mixed bag, with
airlines cautiously gearing up for a steady increase in passengers by
adding flights and cruise lines holding prices at just 7% under last
year's--far from the rock-bottom rates they were forced to offer in
the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel occupancies are expected to be about the same as last
summer, although room rates are down 15% at many large chain hotels
such as Hilton Hotels Corp., which is predicting summer occupancy at
its 2,000 worldwide properties to be about 80%, or about 5 percentage
points less than last year.</TE>
<TE>   Drive-to destinations and regional theme parks are bracing for the
usual summer crowds; Las Vegas is expecting at least 8.7 million
visitors over the summer, and Six Flags Inc., the largest U.S.
theme-park operator, reported last month that ticket orders for
groups and season passes were rising and that park attendance was
rebounding from a post-Sept. 11 drop-off.</TE>
<TE>   This is more evidence that the real action this summer will be
with families on the road, a trend that caught on immediately after
the terrorist attacks and has since turned otherwise sleepy RV rental
agencies and sales dealerships into a tourism bright spot.</TE>
<TE>   After nearly two years of weak performance, the RV industry is
showing a much needed rebound, said Scott Stember, an analyst with
Sidoti &amp; Co. in New York. Though many dealers were caught with excess
inventory as recently as last year, RV shipments to showrooms are
rising above year-earlier levels. In January, total shipments of RVs,
which include motor homes and trailers that can be towed, rose 11%
compared with 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Demand is quickly outpacing supply," Stember said, adding that he
predicts this year could surpass record levels set in 1999, when
shipments topped 320,000 units.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the stocks of RV manufacturers have been gaining, with
Winnebago Industries Inc., Thor Industries Inc., Coachmen Industries
Inc. and Monaco Coach Corp. reaching 52-week highs last month. The
companies have stepped up production since the beginning of the year.</TE>
<TE>   El Monte RV, one of the country's biggest rental and sales firms,
plans to open 10 more outlets by May; the company reported its
busiest single booking week for rentals the first week of March. In
February, the Santa Fe Springs company saw a 53% increase in revenue,
said spokesman Joe Laing, adding that he has since canceled several
Internet advertisements because the company cannot keep up with the
response.</TE>
<TE>   "What we keep hearing from customers is that this summer,
especially, they want control over their vacations," Laing said.
"RVing lets them control when they leave, where they go, who goes
with them, what they bring. And it's intimate. They're all together,
as a family."</TE>
<TE>   Also benefiting from the RV mania this summer will be campgrounds
and national and state parks. The National Park Service is
forecasting a 15% increase in visitors, and campsites will be
difficult to snag, with one official predicting "nothing less than
madness" at such places as the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone National
Park.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the parks, the National Register of Historic Places
plans to offer 20 special tours focusing on America's cultural
heritage at various monuments, battlefields and historic sites,
responding to an increase in requests for the themed tours. Such
interest in history has helped jump-start summer bookings at
Dallas-based History America Tours, which will organize 17 trips with
historians this year. Owner Pete Brown said one trip, a March Through
Georgia tour scheduled for late summer to early fall, already has
sold out.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, any of our tour spots that you can drive to are going
like gangbusters," said Brown, who opened the travel company 11 years
ago. "We're getting a lot of interest from families who want to see
and learn about America. They want to travel the Nez Perce trail,
retrace Lewis and Clark's footsteps, explore Gettysburg. History is
popular again."</TE>
<TE>   The upswing in family road trips has less to do with security
concerns or fear of flying and more with a sense of renewed
nationalism, said Lisa Delpy, a professor of sports marketing and
tourism studies at George Washington University. For months, families
have listened to anthems and watched flashes of red, white and blue
on television, cars and billboards, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they want to see the mountains and the prairies," Delpy said.
"They want to see and do something that's unique to the U.S., and
that means visiting our parks, our monuments, our ball fields."</TE>
<TE>   For some families, the decision to vacation in an RV this summer
came from wanting to see the country while keeping loved ones close
by. Christ, a retired police chief, plans to take a 21-day trip that
covers some 3,000 miles and will include visits to relatives in
Oregon, Idaho and Nebraska. Christ and his wife, Bobbie, also plan to
tour three national parks on the way so their 7-year-old daughter,
Erin, can learn a little history while on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Flying, he said, wasn't practical--logistically or financially.
The RV is costing Christ about $94 a day plus mileage, and being able
to "wing it" without a strict schedule is most appealing, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The only firm appointment I have is a tee time to play golf in
Oregon on June 27," said Christ, a first-time RV renter. "Other than
that, it's the three of us together, seeing the country and
appreciating what we have. It just seems right."</TE>

<HD>New Swiss Airline Begins Service</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GENEVA</DL>
<LD>Switzerland's new national airline, Swiss, took to the air Sunday,
combining the services of the defunct carrier Swissair and regional
airline Crossair.</LD>
<LD>   The first Swiss flight was a 30-minute hop from Basel to
Zurich--the two headquarters of the new airline. The airline's new
boss, Andre Dose, was aboard the flight, said spokesman Patrick
Jeandrain.</LD>
<LD>   The last Swissair plane will not touch down until today. Flight
SR145 from Buenos Aires and Sao Paulo, Brazil, is scheduled to arrive
in Zurich at 7:20 a.m. local time.</LD>
<TE>   Dose, formerly head of Crossair, told Swiss radio that he was
optimistic about the airline's future. He said reservations for
flights so far had been better than expected.</TE>
<TE>   But he said it would take some time to settle an accord to enter
the Oneworld Alliance headed by AMR Corp.'s American Airlines and
British Airways. Swiss has already announced a code-sharing
partnership with American.</TE>
<TE>   Swissair collapsed in October with debt of $7.9 million, and it
took an injection of $273 million in emergency funds from the
government to keep its planes in the air over the winter period.</TE>
<TE>   The government then helped organize a group of corporate sponsors,
led by Nestle. Federal and local governments and Swiss companies
raised $1.7 billion to give Swiss a stable financial base.</TE>
<TE>   The new company will have 128 aircraft and fly to 126 destinations
in 59 countries.</TE>

<LD>Commercial Web sites are gradually collecting less personal data from
visitors and giving them more control over how that information is
used, according to a new study.</LD>
<LD>   Online privacy protection among the 100 most popular Web sites has
grown steadily but not significantly since the Federal Trade
Commission last examined the issue in May 2000, a conservative think
tank said.</LD>
<LD>   Top sites such as Weather.com and Dogpile.com are now less likely
to demand names, telephone numbers or other personal information and
are more likely to let visitors stop them from passing that
information on to other companies, according to the Progress &amp;
Freedom Foundation, which studies the digital revolution and its
implications for public policy.</LD>

<HD>Business Cards Going Digital</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM HEID</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Here's my card." That's one of the most common three-word phrases in
business--right up there with "Let's do lunch" and "I'm laid off."
Even in this e-era, the lowly business card endures.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the business card has evolved along with the times.</LD>
<LD>   There are virtual cards that can travel with e-mail messages and
optical cards that can hold megabytes of information. Hand-held
computer users routinely beam contact information to each other using
infrared links. And a clever scanner and its accompanying Internet
service have brought conventional cards into the digital age.</LD>
<TE>   The virtual business card is made possible by an Internet standard
called vCard. All current e-mail programs support the vCard standard,
as do Palm- and PocketPC-based hand-helds and even some cell phones.</TE>
<TE>   Once you store your contact information as a vCard--consult your
e-mail program's online help to learn how--you can include the vCard
as an attachment to your outgoing e-mail. If your e-mail recipients
want to add you to their electronic address books, they can do so
with a few mouse clicks.</TE>
<TE>   Yahoo Inc.'s People Search, an online white pages service, also
supports vCard. After you locate those long-lost friends, add their
contact information to your little silicon book by saving it as a
vCard.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest problem with a virtual business card is that you can't
put one in the hand of a prospective colleague.</TE>
<TE>   Optical business cards bridge the physical and the digital,
combining a printed name and address with enough storage space to
hold video and audio clips, digital images or thousands of pages of
text.</TE>
<TE>   Optical business cards are essentially rectangular CD-ROMs:
They're the same size as an ordinary business card, but can store
about 50 MB of data.</TE>
<TE>   Photographers and designers can distribute portfolios of their
work, musicians can hand out demo discs, real estate agents can give
away virtual tours of their listings, and salespeople can include
catalogs in Portable Doc Format.</TE>
<TE>   CD business cards work in virtually any PC or Macintosh with a
tray-loading CD mechanism. They can jam if you use them with a
slot-loading CD drive--the kind that suck the CD into place.</TE>
<TE>   Prices for CD business cards vary widely and are lower when you
order large quantities. One replicator, Redmond, Wash.-based Isomedia
Inc., charges 70 cents a card in quantities of 1,000, and 55 cents
each in quantities of 5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Most replicators also sell blank CD-R media that you can burn
using your own CD burner, and many will preprint the blanks with your
contact information.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's that stack of paper business cards cluttering your
desk drawer. Pitch them all, I say--but first, run them through Corex
Technologies' $299 CardScan Executive 600c. This pint-sized scanner
is smaller than a Rolodex and connects to the Universal Serial Bus
port of a Windows PC. (It also works with Macs running Connectix
Corp.'s VirtualPC.)</TE>
<TE>   The CardScan's character-recognition software does an impressive
job of deciphering complex card layouts and putting each piece of
information in the correct place. Impressive, but occasionally
imperfect. You'll want to proofread vital statistics such as numbers
to make sure they're right.</TE>
<TE>   In my tests, scanning a card took about 10 seconds. If you've
written notes on the back of a card, you can scan it, too, and the
CardScan software will save an image of your scrawl.</TE>
<TE>   Once you've scanned a stack of cards, you can save the contacts in
a variety of formats, including vCard.</TE>
<TE>   You can bring them into your e-mail program's address book, beam
them to your hand-held, or upload them to CardScan.Net, a free
service that stores your contacts online so you can retrieve them
from anywhere in the world. You can even view a MapQuest-generated
map of any contact's address.</TE>
<TE>   Try that with your Rolodex.</TE>

<HD>Standing Up to the Law</HD>
<DH>Library system director says the Children's Internet
Protection Act is folly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It all started with a banned book.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Hamon remembers the day "The FBI No One Knows" arrived in
his hometown of Scottsbluff, Neb. The book, which was critical of the
federal agency, caused a brouhaha in the 1950s among members of the
John Birch Society, which pressed for library records to identify
anyone who had checked it out.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly, reading a book became a risk. "It was a terrible time of
mind control," said Hamon, who now is director of the South Central
Library System in Wisconsin.</LD>
<TE>   The Wisconsin libraries are part of a group of plaintiffs
challenging the constitutionality of the Children's Internet
Protection Act in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania. The act requires libraries and schools that receive
federal "e-rate" grants to install filtering software to block access
to pornography and other material.</TE>
<TE>   The trial began last week and is set to conclude in the next few
days. A decision from the court is expected by the end of May.</TE>
<TE>   The government contends that because printed pornographic
materials are not in many library collections, there is no reason
online obscenity should be available.</TE>
<TE>   But Hamon, who testified against the act last week, said that
using filtering software in public libraries is just another form of
censorship, not so different from the book controversy of his
childhood.</TE>
<TE>   "This case reminds me of those times," Hamon said. "It wasn't
right back then, and it's not right now."</TE>
<TE>   Question: What is the modern role of a library and a librarian,
given that the Internet has brought a universe of information into
the home?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: It is a universe, but it's filled with misinformation and
can be confusing to navigate. Librarians help organize and find
information--not only what's on our shelves, but also what's in other
locations and on the Internet. If it's online, we'll point to things
that are legitimate and accurate. If you need information on just
about anything, we either have it or we'll get it. That's our job.</TE>
<TE>   A library is not only based on the physical collections we've got,
but on being a part of the community. We have a lot of rural
communities in our system, from our capital city, Madison, with a
population of 200,000, down to 300-person towns. Each community
wasn't seen as complete until it has a library.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why would a bunch of libraries in the Midwest get involved in
this particular case?</TE>
<TE>   A: We knew that this case was going to have a major impact on our
future. For a long time, we couldn't afford to connect our libraries
[to the Internet]. To go to our northernmost cities, just getting a
dedicated 56-kilobyte line cost us $1,800 a month. For a lot of
little communities, it was out of the question.</TE>
<TE>   You can't turn to the big commercial Internet providers for help.
A lot of them won't bring high-speed connections to a small community
because they can't make a profit.</TE>
<TE>   For someone to use AOL, it's a long-distance telephone call.
Imagine paying a long-distance fee just to check your e-mail. For
these communities, the library is their only means to getting a
high-speed connection. We need the e-rate money to help pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why fight the Children's Internet Protection Act? The federal
government's position is that CIPA is designed to prevent kids from
being exposed to sexually explicit material.</TE>
<TE>   A: This law doesn't really protect kids. If they tried to pass a
law that had to restrict access for just children, they might have
succeeded. Of course, we will always try to protect children. If they
insist on going to places [on the Internet] that are unacceptable,
then we turn to their parents. We're not always going to be
successful, to be honest. But we try our best.</TE>
<TE>   This law, though, is about restricting access for everyone,
including adults. That's what we disagree with.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why not use filters?</TE>
<TE>   A: They're technically ineffective. Even when sites are blocked,
who makes the decision on what information to keep and what to block?
People won't be able to get the information they need because they
won't know what's been left out.</TE>
<TE>   There are a lot of kids who need to find out things. During the
testimony in the trial, we learned about a girl who wanted to know
about STDs [sexually transmitted diseases]. It was a case of her
wanting to know, "If there's a rash and it looks like this, what
could it be?"</TE>
<TE>   That happens all the time in libraries. People want their privacy.
When you block information, they have to come ask someone instead of
having the tools to do the research themselves. It's mortifying.</TE>
<TE>   If a group tells you what you can read and think, it's not right.
It isn't up to the government to tell you what to think, and it isn't
for me to tell you what to think. That's up to you.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do any of your sites use filters?</TE>
<TE>   A: We have three libraries that filter the terminals in their
children's rooms. Even in those cases, the libraries are perfectly
willing for a child to come out and use an adult terminal.</TE>
<TE>   This all comes down to conflicting local standards. Some libraries
have privacy screens on their terminals. Some don't.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Have the filters worked? Have there been instances of patrons
getting child pornography at the libraries?</TE>
<TE>   A: There was one library in Sun Prairie, a bedroom community
around Madison, that had a situation where child pornography was
found in the bathroom. We don't give out information about our
patrons, so we waited until the police had fulfilled the full extent
of the law before checking to see if certain sites had been accessed.</TE>
<TE>   I got the [Web site] URLs from the police later. The thing I found
interesting was the filters did not block them. One was a portal
site, and the other was a personal page.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Was everyone in your library system unified behind the decision
to join the lawsuit?</TE>
<TE>   A: No. We have 51 libraries. They have the right to feel
differently. I work for the libraries and the library board, which is
appointed by county supervisors in seven counties. They said, "Go for
it."</TE>
<TE>   We have a librarian--Ron McCabe, director of the McMillan Memorial
Library--who wrote a brief for the other side. He's a folk singer and
a great guy. For a while, he was going to be one of the government's
witnesses.</TE>

<HD>Rolling Robot Reporters Into War</HD>
<DH>Journalism: Remote-controlled device could collect
information from front lines--without risking lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THEO EMERY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.</DL>
<LD>Wanted: aggressive war correspondent with interview skills, satellite
phone. Mobility required in hostile, rugged terrain. Pay: None. Solar
panels a plus.</LD>
<LD>   Frustrated by what he considers a dearth of solid news from the
Afghan conflict, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher
has set about trying to build a roving multimedia reporter.</LD>
<LD>   A remote-controlled robot could help journalists troll for news in
the world's hot spots, witnessing battles at close range and even
conducting interviews, said Chris Csikszentmihalyi, director of the
Computing Culture group at MIT's Media Lab.</LD>
<TE>   The invention, modeled on NASA's Mars Explorer, not only would
help keep reporters out of the line of fire but also could help
overcome the U.S. military's restrictions on press access, the
researcher thinks.</TE>
<TE>   Although only a small leap from technology already in use, a
roving robot reporter that can acquire and transmit audio and
video--even interacting with subjects--is a terrific idea, said John
Pavlik, a Columbia University journalism professor whose work centers
on the intersection of technology and reporting.</TE>
<TE>   Csikszentmihalyi (pronounced cheek-sent-me-hi-ee) launched the
project after the Sept. 11 attacks spurred U.S. military action in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Unsatisfied with the grainy, faraway shots of falling bombs that
passed for combat video, he set to work on his newsbot with little
more than off-the-shelf hardware.</TE>
<TE>   About the size of a large dog, the Afghan Explorer is powered by
solar-charged battery packs. High-torque surplus motors from copy
machines drive its rugged all-terrain wheels.</TE>
<TE>   Controlled by satellite phone, it navigates using global
positioning system technology and is intended to be aware of its
environment using accelerometers, thermometers and distance sensors.</TE>
<TE>   A video console mounted atop a forward shaft is a video screen
framed on each side with small Web cameras, intentionally giving the
console a face-like quality.</TE>
<TE>   The stereo images the device records help it navigate and would
allow journalists controlling it remotely to do live interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Engineered to travel four to five miles per hour, the Afghan
Explorer could range about 35 miles per day. In diagrams, a flag with
a peace symbol flies from an antenna to indicate neutrality.</TE>
<TE>   The intent was never to replace a human reporter, said
Csikszentmihalyi, who intends to make the plans available on the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a stupid idea that somehow robotics can replace a person,"
he said. "But no one is bothering to ask, 'Is a Predator unmanned
plane as good as a human soldier?'"</TE>
<TE>   How the U.S. military would react to a robotic front-line media
presence is bound to be an issue.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Brad D. Lowell, spokesman for U.S. Central Command, which has
jurisdiction over Afghanistan, wouldn't comment on how the Pentagon
might treat a creation such as the Afghan Explorer.</TE>
<TE>   Access at bases and other areas under direct military control is
highly restricted for reporters, generally limited to pool
arrangements in which a few journalists file dispatches for all news
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters can travel freely elsewhere, but they do so at their own
risk. In some such cases, media organizations might opt for a news
robot.</TE>
<TE>   Sharri Berg, vice president of news operations for Fox News,
called the Afghan Explorer the likely next step in the fiercely
competitive realm of news gathering.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's trying to get as close to the action as possible," she
said. "Sending a little metal guy in without risking a person's
safety is interesting."</TE>
<TE>   Some media analysts questioned the practicality and political
sensitivity of such a tool.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Giles, curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at
Harvard University, said the introduction by media organizations of
newsbots into combat zones could prompt the Pentagon to place further
restrictions on journalists.</TE>
<TE>   And a newsbot certainly wouldn't have the smarts of a human.</TE>
<TE>   "Would the robot know what to do when someone yells, 'Incoming'?"
asked Giles, a former newspaper editor and publisher. "I'm not sure
how practical it is."</TE>
<TE>   For now, the Afghan Explorer lies in pieces at the MIT Media Lab,
though Csikszentmihalyi hopes to dispatch it to Afghanistan in about
three months.</TE>
<TE>   "In many ways this is no substitute for a human, and likewise, if
this rolls over a land mine, that's not such a bad thing," he said.
"This is expendable in the way that you can't treat a human."</TE>

<HD>On a Search Mission to Outdo Google</HD>
<DH>Developers of Net guide Teoma say its multilayered results
are more effective. It debuts today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL LIEDTKE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Apostolos Gerasoulis has a message for everyone who relies on
Google.com as an online guide: It's time to move on to something
better.</LD>
<LD>   After spending the last six months refining the technology,
Gerasoulis and his development team will roll out a search engine
this evening called Teoma that will take dead aim at Google, widely
regarded as the best way to find something on the Web.</LD>
<LD>   "We are the next generation in search," said Gerasoulis, a Rutgers
University mathematics professor who has had Google in his sights
since founding Teoma in 1999. "Google has reached its maturity. We
think people will prefer using a new technology that addresses their
needs with greater authority."</LD>
<TE>   Mountain View, Calif.-based Google views Teoma as "an interesting
approach" to searching, but remains confident its site will continue
to provide the quickest, most useful responses on the Web, said Craig
Silverstein, Google's director of technology.</TE>
<TE>   "We think the jury is still out on how effective [Teoma] is,"
Silverstein said. "The user interaction required to get where you
want to go can be pretty time-consuming."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the increased competition should improve the quality
of online searches, the second-most popular application on the Web.
Only e-mail is used more frequently than search engines.</TE>
<TE>   "I doubt Teoma will become a Google killer," said Danny Sullivan,
editor of SearchEngineWatch.com. "But it could become an interesting
second choice, and that should keep Google on its toes."</TE>
<TE>   Teoma isn't the first to try to outdo Google. Online search
pioneer AltaVista tried to recapture some of the following it lost
after Google's emergence by launching a copycat site called
Raging.com in May 2000. Raging.com never made significant inroads,
and AltaVista ended the experiment last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Google hasn't had anyone really try to challenge it for a while,
so it's going to be interesting to see how Teoma stacks up," said
industry analyst Rob Lancaster of Yankee Group.</TE>
<TE>   Before it can threaten Google, Teoma still must prove it's the
best among other lesser-known but technologically promising search
engines, Sullivan said. This second tier of innovative search engines
include Alltheweb.com and Wisenut.com, a Santa Clara, Calif.-based
start-up recently purchased by LookSmart Ltd. for $9.25million.</TE>
<TE>   Teoma--a Gaelic term for "expert"--lacked the financial resources
to mount a serious challenge to Google until Gerasoulis and co-owners
agreed to sell their Piscataway, N.J.-based company to Emeryville,
Calif.-based Ask Jeeves Inc. for $4.4 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   Since the sale, Teoma has continued to provide search results on
its site, but Ask Jeeves kept the most powerful tools under wraps
during an extended testing phase. The retooled Teoma site is
scheduled to debut at 5 p.m. today.</TE>
<TE>   It won't be easy to topple Google, founded in 1998 by Stanford
University graduate students Larry Page and Sergey Brin.</TE>
<TE>   In a measure of its popularity, Google processes more than
150million search queries a day through its own increasingly popular
site and other highly trafficked online destinations, such as Yahoo,
that license Google's technology. What's more, Google has 3 billion
Web documents in its index, compared with 200 million pages for
Teoma.</TE>
<TE>   Google users who visit the Teoma page will notice the similarities
between the sites. Like Google, Teoma offers a mostly blank page
broken up by a few bright colors.</TE>
<TE>   Both sites depend on complicated algorithms to analyze search
requests, but Teoma says its formula is more effective because it
breaks the Web into clusters of online communities. This enables
Teoma to categorize its results better than Google and offer more
helpful choices to refine a request.</TE>
<TE>   Besides providing a basic list of primary results, Teoma presents
links to sub-categories that may be related to a topic, as well as a
section devoted to "expert" sources.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are looking for something on the Web, we will help you
find it, learn about it and investigate it," Gerasoulis said.</TE>
<TE>   Teoma's multilayered approach might overwhelm some Web surfers
accustomed to Google's more straightforward approach.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the beautiful things about Google is that it really is
'Search for Dummies,'" Lancaster said. "Teoma is going to have to
educate people how to get the most from its site."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Google's early days, Teoma will have ample marketing muscle
to help spread the word about its site.</TE>
<TE>   Even as its natural-language search engine lost ground to Google
and other rivals, Ask Jeeves continued to build one of the Web's
best-known brands. Ask Jeeves also has been a publicly traded company
for nearly three years, another factor that should make it easier to
draw attention to Teoma, Lancaster said.</TE>
<TE>   Privately held Google became hugely popular without any major
marketing campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Teoma already has paid dividends on Ask Jeeves' main site, which
began incorporating the improved search technology in mid-December.
Since it began to draw on Teoma's technology, Ask Jeeves says it has
registered a 25% increase in the number of clicks on its search
results while the rate of people leaving Ask.com in apparent
frustration has declined by 15%.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer, Ask Jeeves plans to begin licensing Teoma's search
engine to other sites. Licensing is already a successful business for
Google, which collected $7.1 million in fees from Yahoo Inc. last
year, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.</TE>
<TE>   "Google is always going to be good, but we think we can offer a
very viable alternative," said Steve Berkowitz, president of Ask
Jeeves' Web properties.</TE>

city from a previously unknown ancient civilization.</LD>
<LD>   Manuel Iturralde, research director of Cuba's Natural History

<HD>Is the Egg Cooked? Give It a Spin and See</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Q: Why does a hard-boiled egg spun on a tabletop rise on one end and
spin like a top?</LD>
<LD>   A: Researchers from Japan and England reported in the March 28
Nature that they spent six months filching eggs from their family
refrigerators and trying to explain the mysterious forces controlling
this behavior. Although it required a lot of math to solve the
problem, the final cause was simple: friction.</LD>
<LD>   Imagine an egg spinning on its side on a tabletop. Because of the
curve of its shell, it is touching the table at just one point. But
the contact point is not fixed; it slides in a small circle around an
imaginary vertical axis. As the egg slides across the table, the
friction created slows the egg's rotation slightly, and the contact
point with the table moves off-center. The egg begins to twist as it
spins. One end slowly rises until the egg stands vertically. For a
few seconds, anyway.</LD>
<TE>   The egg can be any size or type. But it must be hard-boiled. When
you try to spin a soft egg on a table the fluid inside lags behind
the shell. By the time the fluid is spinning at the same rate as the
shell, the egg doesn't have enough kinetic energy to stand up.</TE>

<LD>Heart attack patients who get an emergency angioplasty to open a
blocked artery also should routinely have a stent inserted to keep
the blood vessel from clogging again, a large study concludes.
Previous studies have found that balloon angioplasty is superior to
clot-dissolving drugs in treating heart attacks, offering a better
survival rate and fewer complications.</LD>
<LD>   Still, an artery can clog again after angioplasty, and the new
study was done to see if stents or a blood-thinning drug can improve
the outcome. A stent is a wire-mesh tube.</LD>
<LD>   The research on 2,082 patients, reported in the March 28 New
England Journal of Medicine, showed that angioplasty and stents are
more effective than angioplasty alone. Without a stent, patients were
twice as likely to have problems and need a second procedure.</LD>

<LD>Scientists have identified what they believe is the largest octopus
ever seen, a 13-foot-long, 165-pound giant hauled from the depths
near New Zealand's Chatham Islands. The specimen, caught in a
trawler's net, was badly damaged, but it was clearly a massive
animal, said National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research
marine biologist Steve O'Shea.</LD>
<LD>   He had provisionally identified the specimen, caught at a depth of
more than 3,000 feet, as Haliphron atlanticus, a bright red,
jelly-like species of octopus not previously found in the South
Pacific.</LD>

<HD>Soil Scientists Strike Pay Dirt</HD>
<DH>Samples of earth from a long-ago experiment in the Angeles
forest are a treasure for researchers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a wooden shed tucked away in the Angeles National Forest, history
is stored in a bottle. Or, to be more precise, in almost 1,000 Mason
jars filled with 65-year-old dirt.</LD>
<LD>   The byproducts of a failed science project concluded long ago, the
jars, and the quart of mountain soil each one holds, are the leading
characters in a tale of how serendipity sometimes shapes science.</LD>
<LD>   The setting is the 17,153-acre San Dimas Experimental Forest, a
portion of the larger Angeles National Forest set aside during the
presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt to conduct scientific research.</LD>
<TE>   Projects conducted at the experimental forest usually represent
the ecological concerns of their time: Current studies often focus on
how man has changed the environment.</TE>
<TE>   But in the forest's early days, the mid-1930s, some scientists
were bent on controlling nature. One plan: Replant the San Gabriel
foothills with less-thirsty vegetation so that the forest would yield
more water for the communities below.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of the Civilian Conservation Corps, scientists
embarked on an ambitious project in 1935 to test their theories. In a
vast clearing within the forest, they built a series of lysimeters,
complicated, oversized planters, that would measure how vegetation
took in and processed water.</TE>
<TE>   The lysimeter project was so elaborate and labor-intensive that it
probably never would be duplicated today. It took nearly two years
for the scientists, working with the CCC, to construct 32 lysimeters,
most of them 11 feet wide, 21 feet long and 6 feet deep.</TE>
<TE>   It was, according to the Journal of Forestry, "one of the largest
lysimeter installations in existence." Five types of native
vegetation were planted: scrub oak, Coulter pine, buckwheat and the
evergreen shrubs chamise and ceanothus.</TE>
<TE>   A concrete bunker below the planters housed an elaborate system of
tanks--massive contraptions manufactured by Republic Steel in
Youngstown, Ohio--to measure rainfall, runoff and the amount of water
that percolated within the lysimeters' soil.</TE>
<TE>   For almost 30 years, scientists regularly descended a set of
concrete steps into the narrow, chilly bunker, often scribbling
mathematical equations in pencil on the outside of the tanks.</TE>
<TE>   But, the scientists learned, the lysimeters did not sufficiently
reproduce the natural environment of the forest to supply meaningful
data.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the soil in the planters, like soil in a
flower pot, pulled away from the planter walls, allowing water to
rush in through the cracks--something that would not happen in the
open forest.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great chalkboard idea that didn't pan out," said Pete
Wohlgemuth, a hydrologist with the U.S. Forest Service, who serves as
the experimental forest's manager.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists used their data with trepidation, publishing a few
papers on the project but, for the most part, allowing the research
to peter out. After a fire swept through the San Dimas Experimental
Forest in 1960, burning most of the plants in the lysimeters, the
study concluded for good.</TE>
<TE>   That is, until the late 1980s, when Robert Graham, a professor
newly arrived at UC Riverside, was given what he calls a gift.</TE>
<TE>   Graham was just starting to teach soil science at Riverside in
1986 when he got a call from Hutch Wood, a research scientist at the
experimental forest.</TE>
<TE>   "There's something really interesting out here that I want you to
see," Wood told Graham. He took the professor to a pyramid-shaped
building only a few hundred feet from the lysimeters.</TE>
<TE>   Graham and Wood climbed down a ladder through the building's only
entrance. Inside, Graham first glimpsed the Mason jars that would
become the focus of his research for the next 20 years. Each
contained a sample of 1930s soil, a sort of dusty, dirty historical
archive.</TE>
<TE>   "Hutch showed me the shed with all the samples labeled in fountain
pen," Graham said recently. "I thought, this is an
opportunity--there's nothing like it in the world."</TE>
<TE>   The shed resembled the storage cellar of someone with a serious
jam-making bent. For Graham, Wood and other researchers, each one of
those airtight jars was, in essence, a time capsule, an authentic
version of the soil that once was.</TE>
<TE>   When the lysimeters were built, the original researchers had taken
samples of soil every two inches down in the planters and had labeled
the jars accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent visit to the forest, Wohlgemuth acted as a tour guide
to the treasure hidden within the pyramid. He climbed down into the
building and brought out a jar: Lysimeter 13, Layer 11, its fading
label read. The 13th lysimeter from the left--one of the ceanothus
planters--22 inches down.</TE>
<TE>   "It's mind-boggling to see this level of intense commitment to a
project of this nature," said Wohlgemuth of the scientists and CCC
volunteers who assembled the jars.</TE>
<TE>   At first, UC Riverside's Graham was curious whether the passage of
half a century would actually be enough to show measurable changes in
soil. "I thought, this could be good," he said of his first feelings
about the project. "But I also thought, there hasn't been enough
time."</TE>
<TE>   The lysimeters proved otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Graham began comparing the soil in the jars with the equivalent
layers still in the lysimeters. "We measured [acidity], the percent
of sand, silt and clay--performed a number of chemical extractions.
We even dissolved the soil completely with hydrofluoric acid and
analyzed the complete composition of the soil."</TE>
<TE>   And what he found was that the soil had, indeed, changed. And
drastically.</TE>
<TE>   Levels of zinc and lead in soil that had been exposed to the
current environment were highly elevated compared to the soil in the
jars.</TE>
<TE>   "We expected to find the lead increase, because of leaded
gasoline," said Graham. "The zinc was a surprise to us. At first, we
didn't know the probable cause. But it probably was related to tires,
like steel-belted tires."</TE>
<TE>   Graham suggested that as automobile tires wear down, particles
dispersed into the atmosphere find their way into the upper levels of
the forest soil. "We aren't certain of that," he said, "but that's
what we can interpret."</TE>
<TE>   Graham also discovered that a soil layer known as an argillic
horizon develops much faster than had been believed. The argillic
horizon is the thin layer of clay that accumulates in soil as clay
particles leach downward. Soil scientists had thought that thousands
of years were required for such a layer to develop.</TE>
<TE>   Using the soil in the jars--noting that in some of the lysimeters
argillic horizons now exist that clearly were not there when soil was
placed in the jars--Graham and his team could demonstrate that the
process takes not centuries, but decades.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the research Graham has conducted so far has focused on
just four of the 32 lysimeters, and he says he has tested only a
fraction of the jars housed in the dark shed.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that we need to analyze every one of those jars," he
said. "But as more and more people find out about them, more people
step forward with interesting questions to study."</TE>
<TE>   Other studies are planned, including a controlled burn at the
lysimeters to assess how the soil responds to fire.</TE>
<TE>   Wohlgemuth, who has worked in the San Dimas Experimental Forest
for more than 20 years, said that for a long time, the lysimeter site
was little more than an expensive museum piece.</TE>
<TE>   "But subsequent soil scientists have justified its existence," he
said. "It's still a site where people want to come to work. I'm
always in awe when I see it."</TE>

<HD>Debate Over Color of the Universe Raises Some Red Flags</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K.C. Cole</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's been a certain amount of snickering in astronomy circles
lately over the "color of the universe" brouhaha. In case you missed
it, in January, astronomers from Johns Hopkins University announced
that the universe was turquoise. In February, they found a bug in
their code, and now they say it's closer to beige ("cosmic latte" is
the current favored name).</LD>
<LD>   "Why just the color?" one astronomer cracked. "Why not its
texture? How does it feel?"</LD>
<LD>   Is it sticky or smooth? Sad or gay? If it's on the green side,
does that mean it's jealous of some other universe? If it's red, is
it blushing? If it's beige, is it bored?</LD>
<TE>   There's a serious reason to study the color of the galaxies:
Spectral lines in the light from stars reveal the mix of ingredients
that make them up.</TE>
<TE>   What raised eyebrows was the fact that the astronomers figured out
the color of the universe only as it would seem to human eyes--an
awfully anthropocentric way to look at things: Me, me, me. The
universe would look quite different to a snake or a cat or a bee or a
bat.</TE>
<TE>   Focusing on visible light, in fact, means throwing away 99% of the
electromagnetic spectrum. Astronomy depends on a wide array of
telescopes that look at all of the light, from gamma rays to
microwaves.</TE>
<TE>   And if you took all the wavelengths into account, the galaxies
would radiate in the infrared. Even that light would be swamped by
the microwave glow left over from the big bang.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, most of the matter in the universe doesn't give off
light at all. So the true color of the universe has to take into
account the 90% of matter that is "dark" or, more accurately,
transparent. That would make the universe the color of clear glass.</TE>
<TE>   And cosmologists are becoming convinced that most of the universe
isn't even made of matter, but some mysterious "dark energy" that
pushes galaxies apart, behaving like a kind of anti-gravity. Color it
repulsive.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, the Johns Hopkins astronomers hit on something far more
subtle and interesting than the color question, which they attached
to a larger paper admittedly for "a bit of fun," as one of them put
it.</TE>
<TE>   "One moral of this story is we should have paid more attention to
the 'color science' aspect," this astronomer said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, how we see color is a complex and controversial question:
"The history of the investigation of colour vision is remarkable for
its acrimony," writes Richard L. Gregory in his classic book "Eye and
Brain."</TE>
<TE>   "The problems have aroused more passion than passion itself."</TE>
<TE>   Color vision is completely counterintuitive. In the first place,
the human visual system evolved to do more with less (rather unlike
our economic system). In fact, it's been known for nearly 200 years
that we see the entire panorama of possible color with just three
kinds of receptors, those for red, green, and violet.</TE>
<TE>   Colors like yellow are mixtures--in this case of red and green.
The sensation of "yellow" is something like H2O, a mixture that is
nonetheless pure--and with properties entirely different from the
ingredients that make it up. So if you shine a red light and a green
light on a white wall, the place where they overlap is yellow. Add
violet to this mix, and colors immediately bleach into white. No
matter how many times I've played this trick, it still astonishes me.
(Definitely try this at home.)</TE>
<TE>   Still, the wavelength of light is only part of the story. Seminal
experiments by Edwin Land showed that it takes only two narrow bands
of light to reproduce nearly the entire visible spectrum in the
brain. The color we see depends on everything from general
surroundings to expectation, from edges to illumination, physiology
and psychology alike.</TE>
<TE>   As Gregory concludes: "Any simple account of colour vision is
doomed to failure."</TE>
<TE>   The trickiest color of all is white, and it got the Johns Hopkins
astronomers in trouble. There's no exact formula for "white"; the
brain constantly recalibrates white depending on context.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, what we see as "white" is just the whitest thing around.
If you take a white piece of paper into a room illuminated only in
red, for example, the paper still looks white. The brain keeps colors
constant under different lighting conditions; otherwise, the world
would be a kaleidoscopic blur.</TE>
<TE>   Unknown to the Hopkins' astronomers, the freeware program they
used to calculate the color of the universe set a "white point" for a
reddish environment. This made the color of the galaxies appear, on
average, turquoise.</TE>
<TE>   As the universe ages, there will be fewer young, hot, blue stars,
and more older, cooler, reddish ones, pushing the universe further
into the red. Eventually, the stars themselves will collapse into
black holes.</TE>
<TE>   Only then will the universe finally find itself in the black.</TE>

<HD>'Lock 'Em Up' Isn't Enough</HD>

<BD>Jay Adams is a clinical psychologist who has worked
with sex offenders in state hospital, outpatient and prison settings.

<DL></DL>
<LD>Public policy regarding sex offenders in this country has been formed
by politicians who saw an opportunity to score points with a fearful,
angry and ill-informed public. And no question, sex offenders are an
easy group to beat up on.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the resulting legislation has been costly, destructive and
ineffectual. In the wake of recent news that the House has passed a
bill requiring life sentences for two-time child molesters in federal
jurisdictions, professionals who study and treat sex offenders must
speak out.</LD>
<LD>   A "lock 'em up and throw away the key" philosophy will not work
because of the extent of the problem. Studies tell us that one in
three women and one in six men (some say one in four) experience
unwanted sexual contact with an adult before age 18. One in four
women will be sexually assaulted as an adult.</LD>
<TE>   In California alone there are more than 60,000 sex offenders in
prison or on parole. They receive no treatment in prison and are
returned to society at a rate of about 300 per month.</TE>
<TE>   Once on the streets, they are required to register as sex
offenders. But they receive little help because parole resources are
overwhelmed and severely underfunded.</TE>
<TE>   There is also evidence that the violence to which they are
subjected in prison actually makes them more dangerous. And there is
no doubt that the stresses they experience outside of prison--fear of
disclosure, loss of jobs, fear for their very lives--increase the
likelihood that they will offend again.</TE>
<TE>   We have been far too willing to impose extreme and expensive
sanctions without committing resources to treatment. Many states have
passed Megan's laws, which may make the public feel better. It is
doubtful that they have actually made children safer, however, as
recent cases in California and Oregon tragically attest.</TE>
<TE>   Many states have also followed the lead of Kansas, Washington and
California in passing "sexually violent predator" laws. The public is
misguided if it believes that these laws are a solution to the
problem of sex offending, for a number of reasons.</TE>
<TE>   First, it costs up to $400,000 per individual to successfully
commit someone as a sexually violent predator and $107,000 more per
year to keep them at Atascadero State Hospital, the sole facility in
California that houses them. Since 1996, California's sexually
violent predator law has cost taxpayers about $300 million, with
another $300 million needed to complete a new facility at Coalinga.</TE>
<TE>   There is also the question of the law's fairness. Many sex
offenders spend years in prison receiving no treatment but then are
told six months prior to release that they have a serious mental
disorder that requires "treatment" for an indefinite period in the
state hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Even if civilly committed sex offenders complete treatment and
proceed to the outpatient part of the program, where will they go?
What community is likely to accept someone who has been labeled a
"sexually violent predator"?</TE>
<TE>   Members of the public and, sadly, even some professionals contend
that sex offenders always offend again and that they cannot be
treated. Neither is accurate. Studies of sex offender recidivism in
Canada, Europe and the U.S. indicate that about 17% of untreated sex
offenders offend again. Compare that with a 60% rate in California
for all types of offenders. The field of sex offender treatment is
less than 20 years old, but studies in Canada and the U.S. show
significant advances in effectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   The time is long overdue for the public to stop accepting
knee-jerk solutions for what is a profound and pervasive problem in
our society. Our resources for schools and social services are being
drained to support a prison system that at best doesn't work and at
worst makes people more violent.</TE>
<TE>   We have to demand thoughtful, well-researched policies from our
lawmakers to stop the cycle of violence of sex offenses.</TE>

<HD>Not Everyone Wants to Sail on Our Ship</HD>
<DH>In the American dream, others' beliefs are mere flavors of
mankind.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK BOWDEN</AU>
<BD>Mark Bowden is the author of "Black Hawk Down" and,
more recently, "Killing Pablo" (Atlantic Monthly Press, 2001).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We Americans like to think that people the world over are, at heart,
just like us.</LD>
<LD>   This isn't because we're a simplistic and naive people. It is part
of our national faith. We are, after all, a melting pot, a country
made of people from everywhere. No one faith, tribe or race created
America, and no one of the above defines it. The virtues of tolerance
and mutual respect--though too often betrayed--are such a part of our
national faith that they are considered trite. Those of us born in
the last half-century were raised on it, from the dolls at Disney
World singing "It's a Small World" to Michael Jackson's "We Are the
World."</LD>
<LD>   We cling to this belief despite ample evidence to the contrary,
whether it is political oppression in China, racial hatred in
Zimbabwe, religious fanaticism in Iran, tribal conflict in Somalia or
ethnic battles in the former Yugoslavia. The fact that these
conflicts persist is blamed on backwardness or the bad influence of
oppressive leaders. We assume that the people who inhabit these
countries, unlike their leaders (who are not chosen democratically,
after all) long for peace, freedom and prosperity, a world where
differing races and religions are respected, even treasured, and
where the human family is enriched by variety and the free exchange
of ideas.</LD>
<TE>   Well, we are not the world.</TE>
<TE>   In most places, people long for victory, not peace. Their lives
are shaped as much by fear and hatred as by acceptance and love. They
are often complicit in the crimes of their leaders. At heart, they
want their tribe, their race, their political system or their god to
rule. They want not only to live their lives in the manner they
choose but to compel others to do so. They want to kill their
enemies, establish traditional homelands, avenge historical wrongs
and preserve ways of life many Americans fled on their way here.</TE>
<TE>   "We Are the World" is largely an American dream. It rests upon
certain basic suppositions that are far from universally embraced. It
presupposes an overarching secular legal frame around religion, race
and ethnicity. It rejects, at its core, the final truth of any faith,
or of any distinct tribal, racial or ideological destiny.</TE>
<TE>   In this utopia, our utopia, the righteous beliefs of millions are
relegated to mere flavors of mankind. The ongoing struggle to create
this kind of state is one of the great triumphs of Western
civilization. Our pride in this dream has led us to believe that the
rest of the world would be eager to share it.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't. Our utopia is just one of many. As the attacks of Sept.
11 illustrated horribly, there are plenty of people who would rather
die (and kill as many of us as possible) to prevent it from spreading
further. Tribalism, political totalitarianism and religious zealotry
still define the way most people live, and there is nothing
inevitable about their decline. Indeed, at the outset of the 21st
century we find ourselves engaged in a great cultural conflict, one
where we see ourselves as the flag-bearers for goodness, truth and
justice, while others just see us fighting for the "American Way."</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, when the Berlin Wall came down, for a brief time
the global future seemed uncomplicated. For most of the 20th century,
our government approached the world as the theater of a great
showdown between personal freedom, capitalism and democracy and
authoritarianism, communism and one-party rule. Less powerful nations
were irrelevant, Third World, undeveloped and largely forgotten
unless their location or resources gave them strategic importance.
Then communism collapsed, and a "New World Order" began to take
shape. The triumph of democracy and capitalism seemed inevitable.
What drama remained concerned the pace at which rebuilding states
could achieve economic and political parity. With only one successful
model to choose from, the path of the Third World seemed set.</TE>
<TE>   Hardly. In parts of the old Third World our fundamental values are
under siege. Many people the world over, it seems, don't want to be
like us. Our enemies see the rapid spread of the "American Way" as
cultural aggression. In a way, they have a point. Our fast food,
entertainment and lifestyles are invading more traditional societies.
But this is not aggression. The U.S. doesn't impose McDonald's,
"Baywatch," Puff Daddy and Britney Spears on other countries; they
eagerly import them. Anyone who has ever traveled in Africa, Asia or
the Middle East sees the near universal enthusiasm for pop culture.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the concepts of human rights, equality of women,
democracy, tolerance and free speech are infectious. They threaten
traditional societies precisely because they are so seductive to
their own people, particularly the young. Much of the upsurge in
Islamic radicalism is a backlash against the ongoing story of
American success. The ideals that we take for granted are in fact
actively opposed by those who want to preserve more authoritarian
states.</TE>
<TE>   War has a way of clarifying root differences. The attacks on Sept.
11 ought to encourage us to reaffirm unapologetically what we stand
for in this world. The rule of many is better than the rule of a few.
Freedom is an inalienable right. In governance, the imperfect and
permeable laws of man are preferable to the perfect and rigid laws of
anyone's god. Equality of the races and sexes is an absolute good.
Mutual tolerance and civility are morally superior to "ethnic
cleansing" or the "Ministry of Vice and Virtue."</TE>
<TE>   In many places these are fighting words. So we must be prepared to
fight. Not just with guns but with money, diplomacy and persuasion.</TE>
<TE>   We should recognize that the excesses of our society--violence,
materialism, pornography--are as bewildering and repulsive to
traditional societies as their religious or tribal zealotry is to us.
But we also need to stand for something and be consistent about it,
both at home and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Our ideals will ultimately shape a better world. This isn't just a
prescription for the Americanization of the world. Our dominance of
pop culture and global markets is already eroding. Today, it's
American pop music, American films, American TV that color popular
culture around the world. Last year, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden
Dragon," a film set in China starring Chinese actors speaking
Chinese, was sensationally successful in this country, which no one
would have predicted. Pop music charts routinely have performers who
sing in Spanish or other languages. As for TV, look at the impact
that Al Jazeera has had on the coverage of the war on terrorism. In
the future, if our dream prevails, there will be a greater
cross-fertilization.</TE>
<TE>   We will be more like them. The spread of fundamental American
ideals leads not to cultural monotony, but to diversity.</TE>

<HD>A Corporate Board's First Duty Should Be That of a Watchdog</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWARD E. LAWLER III and JAY CONGER</AU>
<BD>Edward E. Lawler III and Jay Conger, professors at
USC's Marshall School of Business, are the authors of "Corporate
Boards: Adding Value at the Top" (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2001).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Corporate boards are like fire departments. When the alarm bell
sounds, they respond to put out the fire. If no alarm sounds, they
rarely move into action. Unfortunately, by the time the alarm
sounds--as it finally did with Enron--the fire may be so out of
control that little can be done.</LD>
<LD>   There are steps that could help. Perhaps the single most important
is to have a chairman who is independent of management. This
practice, which is common in Britain, would ensure that the board can
set its own agenda.</LD>
<LD>   Also, there must be a way for board directors to receive direct
and confidential information from concerned employees, including a
post office box, an e-mail address and a phone number.</LD>
<TE>   Another safeguard would be to have three-fourths of the board
members be independent of the existing management.</TE>
<TE>   They should not be employees or have a consulting relationship
with the corporation or with any member of senior management. There
should be nothing that compromises their ability and willingness to
act independently of the wishes of senior management.</TE>
<TE>   Independent members of the board should meet several times each
year without the CEO or members of management present. In these
sessions, the directors should review the performance of management
and the organization and establish the critical issues they think the
board should address.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, board members should not be paid exclusively in stock
options. Board members need to have a long-term ownership position in
the corporation. Thus, if they receive options, the options should
have vesting periods of at least five years and should be combined
with stock ownership requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Enron had a distinguished board, but it employed few of these
practices. As a result, it was not in a good position to detect and
react to corporate mismanagement.</TE>
<TE>   This is a clear warning to other boards.</TE>

<HD>Argentina's Test of Faith</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than just disturbing, the picture coming from a television
station in Rosario, Argentina, was ominous. It showed more than 100
slum dwellers rushing toward an overturned cattle truck. Then, using
sticks and knives, the men, women and children slaughtered the
animals. By the armfuls they carried away chunks of meat, the first
they had had in a very long time.</LD>
<LD>   The sight was another turn of the screw in this country's painful
and prolonged predicament. Hours before, another TV station had shown
images of angry depositors taking over a bank branch in the resort
city of Mar del Plata.</LD>
<LD>   As scenes like these are repeated across this once proud and
prosperous land, the Argentine government is pushing the
International Monetary Fund to speed up a loan of $25 billion that
would help stir the nation's ailing economy.</LD>
<TE>   Concerned for the South American country but cautious, the IMF
insists that Argentine authorities produce a workable economic reform
program. In addition, U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill is
applying pressure from Washington, urging the Argentines to "move to
a sustainable position."</TE>
<TE>   Both the IMF and the U.S. government properly want to be confident
that the new money won't follow the path of past loans and end up
feathering the nest of some corrupt politician. A solid economic
recovery plan is essential to build international trust.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Clarin, the largest newspaper in Argentina, last week
published a piece of investigative journalism showing another face of
the crisis. The well-respected journal found that last year wealthy
Argentines took $13 billion out of the country and now were keeping
more than $106 billion abroad. This is equal to 76% of the country's
external debt and larger than its annual gross domestic product.
Almost $30 billion is in bank accounts, and a similar sum is held in
bonds and stock market shares.</TE>
<TE>   The government should urge the jittery investors who sent money
abroad to repatriate a fraction of it as investment in Argentina's
future. This would be a show of good faith. The people of Argentina
must demonstrate that they believe in their country before they can
rightly ask others to do so.</TE>

<HD>A Very Public 'Family' Feud</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. Chief Executive Carly Fiorina has thrown more
than 100 million HP dollars into her dogged pursuit of Compaq
Computer Corp., boldly declaring victory on the strength of early
returns from a stockholder vote. Challenger Walter Hewlett is funding
a fierce counterattack, including a lawsuit alleging that Fiorina
illegally steered business to a key shareholder in return for swing
votes needed to complete the controversial deal.</LD>
<LD>   This is not your typical friendly merger. Proxy fights rarely pit
a powerful corporate executive against a dissident director with a
famous name and deep pockets. But rancor generated by the
slash-and-burn battle will benefit shareholders by subjecting the
$19-billion deal to an unusual degree of scrutiny.</LD>
<LD>   HP and Compaq are being forced to hone their merger plans. Teams
have spent 500,000 man-hours on transition planning, a level of
thought that's crucial because corporate mergers and acquisitions
suffer from a mediocre-at-best track record. Management experts agree
that between 35% and 85% of corporate deals fail to deliver the
goods.</LD>
<TE>   The final vote tally isn't expected for several weeks. By then,
HP, Compaq and dissident HP director Hewlett will together have
poured more than $200 million into a campaign with enough back-room
lobbying and hard-fisted politicking to make the cast of "The West
Wing" proud. There's even a possibility of a sequel--the courts could
order a new election.</TE>
<TE>   The very public battle contrasts with the typical "let's make a
deal" doings in which shareholders and directors rubber-stamp
friendly agreements concocted in closed boardrooms. This merger
deserves scrutiny because it would create California's second-largest
headquarters company, with $82 billion in annual sales, 145,000
employees and a big chunk of the market for personal computers, large
business computers and printers.</TE>
<TE>   Why is Fiorina staking her career on this merger? And why is
Hewlett fighting so fiercely to derail it? Fiorina is adamant that HP
needs Compaq to reach the scale needed to remain a force across a
broader technological spectrum. Hewlett counters that bigger isn't
necessarily better and points out sliding profits that have dogged
Compaq since 1999, when the Houston-based company spent $9 billion to
acquire troubled Digital Equipment Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The technology world is littered with the remains of mainframe
computer (DEC and Univac) and PC (Commodore and Kaypro) brands that
failed to keep pace. The battle at HP is really over the meaning of
"keeping pace" today.</TE>

<LD>State agencies and employees are sharing the pain of Gov. Gray Davis'
attempt to reduce a numbing $17-billion deficit. No, wait. That
doesn't include prison guards. In his new budget Davis not only
spares them from belt-tightening, he hikes their pay 33.76% over the
next five years. This shower of riches came four years after the
guards union helped raise $2.3 million for Davis' first gubernatorial
campaign and not long before the guards contributed $251,000 to his
reelection. It will boost the guards' average base salary to about
$65,000 a year, before overtime, from about $50,000.</LD>
<LD>   There is nothing wrong with paying prison guards well. But
proportion matters. Compare that figure to the $47,000 average yearly
salary for the state's credentialed public school teachers, who must
have a college degree and a year of postgraduate training. Or the
pitiful $25,000 or so for a preschool teacher. Correctional officers,
unlike even most police officers, need only a high school diploma and
four months of training. Ebullient lobbyists for the guards say the
raise will "conservatively" cost the state at least half a billion
dollars annually by 2006.</LD>
<TE>   The governor's office also proposes closing five of the state's
nine private prisons June 30, supposedly saving taxpayers a paltry
$5.1 million a year but ensuring job security for members of the
prison guards union. The nonpartisan legislative analyst says even
the touted savings are overrated and will be half that at most.
Moreover, since the state's own prisons are at nearly double capacity
even after a recent decline in the inmate population, closing private
prisons may simply force the state to build new public prisons at
$500 million a pop.</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone recording made for union members, Jeff Thompson, a
lobbyist for the California Correctional Peace Officers' Assn.,
crowed about the raises and the closing of private prisons, which he
called "a thorn in our side as far as professional development."
Davis had, Thompson said, "followed through with promises made in
past years .... So the governor [is] a man of his word in that
regard."</TE>
<TE>   No legislators have challenged the powerful union's pay raise. Nor
is anyone questioning the logic of spending new prison dollars on
raises rather than programs like prison drug treatment and job
training that have the potential to reduce repeat crimes by inmates.
Fortunately, support is building in Sacramento for delaying the
shutdown of private prisons until their cost efficacy and usefulness
are studied.</TE>
<TE>   Private prisons, first opened by Gov. George Deukmejian in the
late 1980s to house minimum-security inmates at lower cost, are not
perfect. But they have done well in recent state audits for their job
training and community service programs. One is at the 288-bed Baker
Community Correctional Facility off Interstate 15 between Los Angeles
and Las Vegas, where inmates trained in basic rescue skills provide
fire department emergency staffing for a desolate, accident-plagued
stretch of the highway.</TE>
<TE>   With record budget deficits threatening the state, there is
growing evidence that private prisons, for some uses, are
cost-effective. How can politicians ignore this alternative? The
answer remains what it has been for years: Follow the political clout
and the campaign money.</TE>

<LD>Re "U.S. Seeks to Reopen Area to Off-Roaders," March 28: The Imperial
Sand Dunes Recreation Area in Glamis was closed as the result of a
collusive lawsuit between the environmental groups and the U.S.
Bureau of Land Management, in which the BLM allowed judgment to be
taken against it without any evidence the off-roaders were actually
harming the milkvetch plant. According to the BLM's own study, the
milkvetch is more abundant now that it was when it was first
quantified in the late 1970s. This is seldom mentioned, yet this was
the purported basis for the closure.</LD>
<LD>   I love Bill Clinton, I love the environment and I am a
ticket-voting Democrat who happens to responsibly use the dunes. I am
also an attorney who has studied and carefully followed (as an
outside observer) the "closure suit" filed by the Center for
Biological Diversity and the Sierra Club. Your article had the same
shrill and unbalanced approach to public land-use issues and majority
rights as that possessed by the special interest groups that filed
the suit in the first place.</LD>
<TE>   Until I got involved in this matter, I thought only the "gun nut"
and militant antiabortion crowd had such singular disregard for the
rights of others in the respective discourses they claim as their
prerogative. This debate regarding land we all own should be governed
by evidence and balance and not by who has the loudest rhetoric. I
hate to admit it, but the man I voted against (G.W. Bush) is the one
who allowed these principles to prevail.</TE>

<LD>Re "Industry's a Key Player in Energy Data," March 26: This headline
comes as no surprise, considering the Bush-Cheney administration's
well-known ties to oil and gas. The big question is, "Why can't the
public get the rest of the story if it is so helpful in making public
policy?" What is the good in keeping "advice, recommendations and
opinions" in the decision-making process a secret? It is said to
protect the free flow of ideas and information within our executive
branch of government.</LD>
<LD>   I have real trouble with that. If people can't stand behind what
they say, then OK, keep them anonymous. But if the substance of their
words can't stand the light of day, then that is intriguing. Thus I
would implore Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham to tell us all how he
made his important energy policy decisions so that we may at least
follow the logic rather than just the money.</LD>

If the Clinton administration responded to a court order by
submitting blanked-out pages, would that fact have been buried in the
10th paragraph of a Page A14 story? I'm guessing not, but I'm
partisan.</TE>
<TE>   I also wonder what would happen to me if I filed a tax return with
empty boxes and undocumented deductions. Then again, I never promised

<LD>Re "Davis: Let Migrants Drive," March 28: Three points. Gov. Gray
Davis has again found a way to straddle an issue. Doesn't he believe
in anything strongly enough to take a firm position one way or the
other? Next, why are these illegal immigrants going to work in
California anyway? The point is that they have no legal right to work
in this country. Why in the world would we grant them a driver's
license to go to jobs they shouldn't have?</LD>
<LD>   Finally, could The Times please stop calling these people
"migrants"? Migrants are people who are on their way to somewhere.
These people who live here are, in fact, illegal immigrants.</LD>

<TE>   Not withstanding other possible flaws of the proposed measure,
there is no evidence that it will improve the safety of California
highways. It seems naive to assume that those "illegal immigrants"
who flunk the driving test, the most dangerous drivers of all, will
stop driving.</TE>
<TE>   Also, it is doubtful that those of them who pass the driving test
will rush to buy auto insurance, which is really quite expensive in
California.</TE>
<TE>   Can one really believe that allowing them to take the driver's
license test will significantly change that?</TE>

<TE>   Verily we must live in La-La Land. Gov. Davis proposes to let
"undocumented" (read illegal) aliens obtain driver's licenses for
work-related purposes. Would someone please inform the governor that
it is illegal (no pun intended) to hire undocumented workers.</TE>
<TE>   Employers must verify, by law, the eligibility status of an
applicant to be hired. Is our governor pandering for votes; totally
clueless as to federal law; attempting a typical political run-around
of existing laws; or all of the aforementioned?</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Davis should stick to fund-raising. That's what he is best
at.</TE>

lunatics are in charge of the asylum. Does anyone believe that these
undocumented folks are going to drive to and from work and then just
park it when they get home? Wake up, California.</TE>
<TE>   This proposal by the governor is just a subterfuge to bolster the
state coffers, which he has managed to deplete through his
incompetent handling of the state's energy crisis. And this is
pandering to the Latino community for votes at its snake-belly
lowest.</TE>

market, and I am so out of here!</TE>

<LD>While I am pleased that current events have shed new light on how out
of touch the Catholic Church hierarchy has become and how these
events have placed pressure on officials to reform, I am disappointed
that there has not been more of a discussion about the role of women
(or lack thereof) in church leadership.</LD>
<LD>   Any system or organization dominated by men--the way the Catholic
Church is--will continue to be dysfunctional and will continue to
create a climate where power and superiority become more important
than protecting children. I have come to the conclusion that my wife
and other women in my life have insight and compassion that I will
never have as a man. These are exactly the gifts that were missing
for so long in business and in government (albeit there is still a
long way to go).</LD>
<LD>   The Catholic Church, however, has yet to even begin the process of
representing the other half of the human race. Until it does, I will
not be hopeful that any real reform can occur.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Church of the People, Not of the Priests," Commentary, March
28: Father Edward Beck, like most people, is tiptoeing around the
subject. If this scandal was another Enron, everybody would be
saying, "Off with their heads." These bishops, archbishops and
cardinals sent these monster priests back to prey on new sets of
parishioners, stonewalled American justice and spent millions of
dollars covering up.</TE>
<TE>   Basically, the Catholic Church is 99% pure and it is the most
beneficial social organization in the U.S., if not the world. If we
don't start cleaning up this mess, God help the church, and all of us
who depend on it, to reach the father through his divine son.</TE>

<TE>   With due respect to Cardinal Roger Mahony and columnist Steve
Lopez (March 27), the problem devastating the Catholic Church in
America today is not pedophilia but homosexuality.</TE>
<TE>   If it were pedophilia, then a proportionate number of females
would have been victimized. But such is not the case. By far an
exceedingly high percentage of male victims are teenagers and not the
children we associate with pedophilia.</TE>
<TE>   By his own admission, Orange County's Father Frederick is gay. So
whom would Mahony and Lopez have him marry? His same sex partner?
While they haven't directly said so, is this what Mahony and Lopez
advocate and/or want to talk about?</TE>

<TE>   It's preposterous to relate celibacy to molestation of minors. As
evidenced by our society, marriage does not stem sick-minded
individuals from preying on children. What Cardinal Mahony ought to
do is to confront the truth and not manipulate it. Moreover, expose
the molesters and make them atone for their crimes.</TE>

<HD>Medicare Cost Crisis Looming for Seniors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Why does the pronouncement by our Social Security commissioner on the
prognosis of Medicare sound so much like the Arthur Andersen audit on
Enron ("Social Security, Medicare Prognosis Is Upgraded," March 27)?
The fact is that Medicare has so far balanced its budget mainly
through arbitrary reduction on reimbursement to health care
providers. The reduction is 5.4% for this year alone and projected to
reach 20%-plus in the next few years.</LD>
<LD>   Given that the annual Consumer Price Index still rises by around
3% and the cost of running a medical practice by at least twice as
much, one can easily surmise that in less than two to three years the
cost to provide health care for the seniors will exceed the
reimbursement by Medicare.</LD>
<LD>   Some physicians have already opted out of the Medicare program due
to its declining payment and onerous regulations, and it should not
be too surprising that many more will follow suit in the next few
years.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, most of the seniors today will remain oblivious to
this looming crisis until a rolling blackout on health care jolts
them out of their complacency--like what the energy crisis did to us
last year.</TE>

<HD>Architect's Gift to His War-Torn Afghanistan Is 'Village of
Hope'</HD>
<DH>Design: Masum Azizi, with a Newport Beach practice, offers
a flexible plan to house and help the displaced. And skilled workers
are ready to pitch in.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some people design dream homes. Masum Azizi has a broader vision: a
dream village in Afghanistan that would house hundreds of homeless
displaced by earthquakes, war and two decades of unrest.</LD>
<LD>   The Newport Beach architect has devoted six months to a project he
calls "The Village of Hope." He set aside other business, paid
several environmental planners and staff members at his firm to help,
and donated his personal time to design energy-efficient and
quake-proof shelters.</LD>
<LD>   "I've lived in this country since 1980, but the first half of my
life, I kind of owe it to Afghanistan," said Azizi, 46. "The least I
can do is come up with a way to help people.... A lot of people get
overwhelmed. They say, 'No, it's not going to work. It's not
possible.' But I think it's very possible. I believe it can be
built."</LD>
<TE>   The concept involves a 2-square-mile grid that can be developed in
sections. It could include homes, a school, a mosque, an orphanage
and green areas. Each small home would be built with local building
materials such as an adobe-styled clay brick. All the homes would be
accessible to the disabled, and each would be within walking distance
of a school.</TE>
<TE>   The design incorporates traditional features, including a cooling
system called baddgeer, which uses an opening on the roof to draw in
air and push it into the home, and an oven, or tanoor, which doubles
as a heating system with underground channels that warm stone slabs
on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Azizi recently finished the design but plans to spend several
months completing blueprints that will show, brick by brick, how to
prepare the clay material.</TE>
<TE>   He has enlisted the help of 2,000 skilled masons, bricklayers and
construction workers in Pakistan and Iran. "They're willing to work,
and they're very anxious to start," Azizi said.</TE>
<TE>   He is eagerly trying to get the project off the ground. He has
made presentations to politicians and hopes to present the plan to
the United Nations, the World Bank and other major aid organizations
that could help implement it.</TE>
<TE>   He estimates that a small home, built in 35 days by four workers,
would cost $5,500. Later, with practice, it would take 17 days and
cost $4,500, he believes.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental planner Debra Einstein said she has watched the
project gain momentum, from just an idea and a few sketches to
detailed plans.</TE>
<TE>   "What got me so excited is Masum's enthusiasm," Einstein said.
"This is homeland. This is where he's from. Even in the beginning
processes when he was talking about the project, I immediately got
excited."</TE>
<TE>   It might be Azizi's enthusiasm or the wistful manner in which he
recalls his country. Environmental planner Nicole Morse said Azizi's
eyes light up when he talks about the Village of Hope and invokes
childhood memories.</TE>
<TE>   When Azizi went to graduate school in Copenhagen, he left behind a
family of builders and a lush country with burgeoning development.</TE>
<TE>   Young professionals were being urged into fields such as
construction, engineering and architecture.</TE>
<TE>   He remembers the first time he walked by the National Museum in
Afghanistan. He was 6 years old, on his way to school, when his
father pointed to the magnificent building and told him, "Your
grandpa built that."</TE>
<TE>   He would proudly pass the museum every day, sometimes running his
hands across the stone wondering if his grandfather's hands had
touched the same spot.</TE>
<TE>   And he felt safe at school, as if he could feel his grandfather's
presence.</TE>
<TE>   But now, Azizi points at a photo of the crumbling museum, nearly
destroyed by bombs and rocket attacks. "Look at what they did to my
grandpa," Azizi said.</TE>
<TE>   He is ready to return to a country he probably won't recognize
after years of warfare. He'll do it to help build his village. All he
needs is a few more dreamers.</TE>

<HD>Jesus Will Save the Catholic Church, Bishop Brown Says</HD>
<DH>Religion: In his Easter message, the cleric says of sex
scandals, 'We can meet the challenge.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Punctuating his Holy Week theme, Bishop of Orange Tod D. Brown
promised Easter Sunday worshipers that Jesus will save the Roman
Catholic Church from any harm arising from the allegations of sexual
molestation now sweeping the nation and his own diocese.</LD>
<LD>   Brown, with tall candles and Easter lilies around him, wrapped up
the most solemn week of the Christian calendar by delivering his
message from the pulpit of Holy Family Cathedral in Orange.</LD>
<LD>   "Neither you nor I had any idea what Lent 2002 would be like,"
Brown said. It has been painful and difficult for Catholics "as the
tidal wave of publicity and revelation rolls across our country about
the terrible deeds and crimes committed by a number of our own
clergy."</LD>
<TE>   Brown then referred to the question posed on this week's Time
magazine cover: Can the Catholic Church save itself? "The answer is
clear: no," the bishop declared. "Jesus is our only savior. Only
Jesus can save the church. And Jesus will save the church."</TE>
<TE>   Brown alluded to the doubts Jesus' followers had when he was
crucified and resurrected. He drew parallels to the confusion that
may now exist because of the sex scandal, and Brown reminded
parishioners how long it took for the disciples and others to find or
rediscover their faith.</TE>
<TE>   "All their hopes had come crashing down with the arrest of Jesus
and his crucifixion," Brown said. "They moved from unbelief,
gradually, and ever so slowly to faith."</TE>
<TE>   Easter, the bishop concluded, is a time for a new beginning and,
for religion, a new way of seeing.</TE>
<TE>   "So with the eyes of faith we can see the terrible news coverage
that our church has experienced over these recent months and we can
see beyond that and realize that indeed we can address these
difficulties," he said. "We can meet the challenge.... There will
indeed be life on the other side of Easter."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, whose diocese contains about 1 million Catholics, has been
praised for his candor during the unfolding crisis. He and other
bishops across the country have used Holy Week sermons to call for a
new openness about the issue, which drew attention beginning in
January when it was revealed that a former Boston priest had been
moved from one parish to another after accusations of sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles, whose archdiocese has an
estimated 3.6 million Catholics, planned to discuss in his Easter
message how sinfulness can intrude upon those who are ordained.</TE>
<TE>   "In our times, even as we await the Easter dawning, we stand at
the foot of the cross gazing upon the one betrayed ... horrified at
the harm done to innocence," Mahony wrote in the sermon he planned to
deliver Sunday. The Los Angeles archdiocese and Orange County's
diocese established zero-tolerance policies for priests last year as
part of a $5.2-million settlement against a prominent O.C. priest.
Since then, three priests in Orange County and several in Los Angeles
have been dismissed.</TE>

<HD>'Magnificent' Easter Service at the Bowl</HD>
<DH>Religion: After Trinity network dispute, the annual sunrise
event delivers hope, despite a shortage of lilies and no live TV
coverage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nothing could deter organizers of one of the nation's best-known
Easter sunrise services on Sunday. Not a last-minute shortage of
lilies. Not a lack of live television coverage. Not even a half-empty
Hollywood Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, event coordinators were downright elated that the event
remained in their hands at all. "So many people were so enthusiastic
because they almost lost the Easter service," said Norma Foster,
president of the Hollywood Bowl Easter Sunrise Service Inc., a
nonprofit that has produced the event for nearly 60 years. "The
community can really be proud that they came together to keep it."</LD>
<LD>   Just two months ago, a coin toss yanked control of the event from
Foster's group and handed it to Trinity Broadcasting Network, one of
the nation's largest Christian television ministries. Trinity, based
in Orange County, backed out after the civic group threatened a
lawsuit; Trinity said it didn't want to get into a public fight over
the service.</LD>
<TE>   The nondenominational service, marking its 80th anniversary,
didn't focus on the controversy, except during a plea for donations.
The service featured actors Forest Whitaker and Shirley Jones, as
well as performers of all ages and ethnic backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   In total, 702 people took to the stage, including singers,
musicians and members of the clergy.</TE>
<TE>   "I expected it to be good," said Laura Gerdes of Buena Park. "I
didn't expect it to be so magnificent."</TE>
<TE>   Gerdes' 9-year-old son, Trevor, was a member of the youth choir,
whose 120-plus singers sat in a structure shaped like a Latin cross.
About halfway through the service, the children yanked off their
black outer capes simultaneously, revealing white uniforms, as they
sang, "Christ the Lord is Risen Today."</TE>
<TE>   The so-called "living cross" has been a staple of the sunrise
Easter service.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Dryden of Studio City arrived at 3:40 a.m. with her
husband and three daughters to reserve good seats. In hindsight, they
could have arrived later because more than half of the 18,000 seats
were empty during the service.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't about who operated it, as long as the show went on,"
Dryden said. "I'm sure it would have been beautiful no matter who did
it."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the Trinity network dispute, organizers were unable to
find a television network to broadcast the event live.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time we got it back, it was too late to do television,"
Foster said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Foster said, the civic group got a late start with
its fund-raising effort, racing to cover the event's $46,000 price
tag.</TE>
<TE>   Planners encountered other problems as well. Because drought
conditions in the state created a shortage of lilies, organizers
asked the public to bring flowers to the stadium this weekend in
exchange for box seats. In the end, they were able to decorate two
large crosses on the stage with calla lilies and place potted Easter
lilies along the periphery of the stage.</TE>
<TE>   As they left the service, many attendees said they were
sympathetic to the community organizers.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it remained in the proper hands," said Scott Stephens,
39, of Studio City. "I definitely don't think it's something that
should have been turned over to a business."</TE>
<TE>   George Skyles, a member of the Southern California Mormon Choir,
said his singing group probably would not have been asked to perform
if Trinity had hosted the event.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in tradition," he said. "It's just what people have
come to expect."</TE>
<TE>   For its part, Trinity had said it deserved a chance to host the
event because it was held in a public forum. Officials said their
show would have been broadcast worldwide and reached out to all
denominations, focusing on Christ's resurrection. But less than two
weeks after winning the service, Trinity backed out, citing bad
publicity.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the civic group say they hope this year's challenge by
Trinity will be the last. They say their group's predecessors created
the Hollywood Bowl and deeded it to the county in exchange for
permission to use it annually for Easter services.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming the civic group retains control of the event, Foster said
she is confident that it will be broadcast live again next year. She
also envisions a telethon a few weeks before the service to raise
money for an endowment.</TE>
<TE>   During their sermons, clergy members prayed for peace in the
Middle East and in war-ravaged Afghanistan. But mostly they talked
about the need to believe in hope and lead spiritual lives.</TE>
<TE>   "The message of Easter is more than a lovely story," said the Rev.
Dr. Alan J. Meenan, senior pastor at the First Presbyterian Church of
Hollywood. "It promises the rebirth of hope. It promises life made
anew."</TE>
<TE>   That message resonated with many in the audience. "We just really
need to pray for peace and be with people in a spiritual way," said
Susan Fischer of Hollywood, attending her first sunrise service.</TE>
<TE>   Said Brady Williams of Los Angeles: "Since Sept. 11, everybody's
trying to get closer."</TE>
<TE>   The service ended with the release of dozens of white doves,
carrying with them the hope for peace.</TE>

<HD>How Deep the Cuts? Even Hahn Can't Say</HD>
<DH>Budget: An uncertain economy makes process more of a
guessing game than usual.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn unveils the new city budget on
April 19, his proposal will include cuts to city services for the
first time since the early 1990s. But even as the mayor compiles next
year's spending plan, it remains unclear how severe those cuts will
have to be.</LD>
<LD>   The downturn in the economy has contributed to a projected
shortfall of as much as $250 million in the 2002-03 budget. However,
Hahn's aides said they hope that the gap will end up smaller once
final revenue projections come in over the next few weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The mayor's task of presenting the City Council with a balanced
budget is made especially difficult this year by the unpredictable
state of the economy. After a year in which some local revenues
plunged and others grew steadily, economists say pinning down how
much money will be coming into the city coffers next year is more of
a guessing game than ever.</LD>
<TE>   "The consensus among economic professionals is that the economy is
recovering, but the question is, 'How quickly will we come along?'"
said Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp. "There are a lot of unknowns out there."</TE>
<TE>   Those unknowns matter a lot. The majority of the city's
$3.2-billion general fund comes from revenues that swell or shrink
with the health of the economy, such as business, sales and property
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Projecting how much the economy will grow, if at all, is the key
to determining exactly how much Hahn will have to put on the cutting
block. Under a worst-case scenario, officials have said everything
but essential public safety programs could come under the hatchet. If
the city's fiscal health improves, departments could undergo more
modest trims that would not be as obvious to Los Angeles residents.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Quiet on Proposed Cuts</TE>
<TE>   The mayor and his aides have declined to divulge the cuts he will
propose. In an interview last week, Hahn said he will try to cover
Los Angeles' shortfall without raising taxes or laying off city
employees. He said his priorities will be to preserve public safety
programs and basic city services.</TE>
<TE>   "But there's going to belt-tightening all over the city," he
warned.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is not the only city wrestling with financial
problems, as municipalities across the country cope with the fallout
of the recession and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. New York has
been hit with its largest budget gap in 30 years, forcing Mayor
Michael R. Bloomberg to slash $1.8 billion from the city budget and
raise taxes and fines. In San Francisco, officials are contemplating
cutting park hours and mental health programs to cover two years of
projected budget deficits.</TE>
<TE>   Budget Plan Requires Creativity</TE>
<TE>   "The Hahn administration, through no fault of its own, has to be
exceptionally creative with the biggest fiscal challenge that any
mayor has ever faced in a decade," said former City Councilman Mike
Feuer, who was head of the council's Budget Committee before he left
office last year. "This is really a time when Mayor Hahn's leadership
is needed."</TE>
<TE>   For Hahn, the budget crunch comes at an especially problematic
moment, just as he tries to win over dissatisfied residents in the
San Fernando Valley, Hollywood and the harbor area who want to break
away and create their own cities.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a huge challenge for me," the mayor said. "It couldn't
have come at a worse time."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said that planning next year's budget has been made more
difficult because steps taken by his predecessor, former Mayor
Richard Riordan, forced Hahn to deplete much of the city's reserves
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said that in Riordan's last budget, the former mayor failed
to fund some items that should have been anticipated, such as
increased sanitation costs and Fire Department overtime.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Hahn said Riordan included one-time revenue
sources--such as money from a business tax amnesty program--in this
year's budget base. That money is not available again in planning
next year's budget.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to go out in style if it's your last year," Hahn said.
"But it still presents us with a huge problem.... If they're one-time
revenues, where are you going to get the money ... next year?"</TE>
<TE>   A former Riordan official disputed Hahn's contentions. If programs
ran out of money, it was because they were badly managed or the City
Council did not give them enough funding when it approved the final
budget, the aide said.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's former aide also argued that one-time revenues are
always used in the city's budget. In fact, a five-year budget
forecast prepared last year by the city administrative officer shows
the city surplus growing as one-time revenue sources disappear.</TE>
<TE>   "When budget season comes around and projections aren't lining up,
budget playbook 101 is to blame the last guy, even if the last guy
left you the biggest reserve in the city's history," said Ben Austin,
Riordan's former deputy mayor for communications.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan aside, Hahn and his aides agree that one of the biggest
problems this year has been an unanticipated decline in city
revenues. Last year, the city administrative officer predicted
revenues would grow at a rate of about 3.5%. Instead, the amount of
money coming into the city shrank.</TE>
<TE>   No one could imagine that problem a year ago, when Los Angeles
ended the year with more than $100 million in reserves, the highest
level ever.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until the first few months of Hahn's administration that
the local economy showed the first signs of the national recession.
Spring sales revenue was down significantly when the first reports
came in over the summer, alarming the city's economists.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard a lot of talk about recession and slowdown, but we had a
surplus," said Rex Olliff, the city's finance specialist. "So it was
hard to grasp that instead of a slowdown, there were actually
negative receipts."</TE>
<TE>   After the terrorist attacks in September, the city's tourism and
travel industry took another hit. Revenue from parking fines dropped
dramatically as the city's enforcement officers were diverted to
control traffic at the airport. Hotel occupancy dropped 25%, which
cut into the city hotel tax.</TE>
<TE>   Local economists are trying to anticipate what will happen in the
next fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   But contradictory signs in different sectors of the economy are
blurring the picture.</TE>
<TE>   Tourism and Sales Remain Down</TE>
<TE>   Tourism and sales remain down, but the housing market is strong.</TE>
<TE>   Olliff, who has been predicting city revenues for more than 20
years, said that task has been harder this year than any year
previous.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very difficult time to really estimate accurately because
the normal patterns aren't there," he said. "There are these
crosscurrents where things are moving in many different directions."</TE>
<TE>   But city officials don't have much room to be off in their
estimates.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're just 1% off, that's $32 million," said William Fujioka,
the city administrative officer. "And $32 million can buy a lot of
services."</TE>
<TE>   There's some good news. Los Angeles' diverse economy means that it
hasn't suffered as much as technology-dependent regions like the Bay
Area, and will recover more quickly, Fujioka said.</TE>
<TE>   And if revenue projections improve before the City Council
approves the budget on June 1, officials can restore some programs
that may be facing cuts now.</TE>
<TE>   But the bad news is that some economists believe the local economy
will not grow much next year.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Thornberg, senior economist at the UCLA Anderson Forecast,
predicts that city revenues will grow by only 2%. "We're going to
kind of float around," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, about $84 million in cost-of-living increases
for city employees is expected to kick in next year. Many of the
increases were negotiated before Hahn took office.</TE>
<TE>   Police officers and firefighters, along with half of the city's
30,000 civilian employees, are due for a 4% raise. The city is in
negotiations with the unions that represent the rest of its
employees, whose contracts should be settled by July.</TE>
<TE>   Economist Kyser has two pieces of advice for the mayor as he
finalizes his first city budget in this climate.</TE>
<TE>   "Be on the cautious side as you estimate your revenues," he said.
"And get a bottle of aspirin, super size."</TE>

<HD>New Chapter Unfolds in O.C. for Genealogists</HD>
<DH>Census: National Archives will unseal the 1930 headcount
today. Researchers are eager at Laguna Niguel archives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most days, researchers camped out in Laguna Niguel's National
Archives reference room chitchat about the past as they untangle the
threads of family history.</LD>
<LD>   In recent weeks, though, the talk has been about the
future--today, to be precise, when archivists believe the unsealing
of 72-year-old census will set off a mad scramble of genealogists
hungry for what one called "the first fresh meat" in a decade.</LD>
<LD>   Today's release lifts a veil drawn by an agreement between the
Bureau of the Census and the National Archives that keeps census data
private for a lifetime--72 years. The census is taken every 10 years
and the last records--from 1920--were released a decade ago. Personal
details from the 2000 census won't be available to researchers until
2072.</LD>
<TE>   The Laguna Niguel archives, one of 14 repositories in the United
States and the only one in Southern California, will open as usual at
8:45 this morning. But at least five other regional centers planned
to open at 12:01 a.m. in a "midnight madness" rush to satiate
genealogists.</TE>
<TE>   "I plan to be asleep," said Constance Potter, an archivist at the
National Archives headquarters outside Washington, D.C., who is
involved in overseeing the national release.</TE>
<TE>   Interest in genealogy has grown explosively in recent years,
giving rise to Web sites like Ancestry.com and leading to parades of
researchers through the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'
family history centers. The libraries, as part of the Mormon faith,
maintain massive files on deceased ancestors. But it will be months
before the 1930 records are available anywhere but the National
Archives, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Although old census records are treasure-troves for genealogists
and historians, the 1930 census is particularly intriguing. Conducted
six months after the 1929 stock-market crash, the census offers
snapshots of family life on the eve of massive national upheaval--the
Great Depression and the mass migration of displaced farmers from the
Great Plains states to California.</TE>
<TE>   The 1930 census reflected the spread of mass media by asking if
families owned radios.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very new medium," said Dave Pemberton, a U.S. Census
historian, who described radios as the cutting-edge technology of the
1920s--much like personal computers in the '90s. An industry survey
reported 60,000 radios sold in 1922, he said. Eight years later, the
1930 census counted 12 million radios among a population of 123
million people in the 48 states.</TE>
<TE>   "And in the early days of radio, the number of sets didn't
necessarily indicate the number of people being reached," Pemberton
said. "People would come from several houses around and drop in on
you if you happened to be the owner of a radio."</TE>
<TE>   Although many genealogists look to census records for details
about ancestors' lives, older researchers will be able to look back
at their youth. People born before April 1, 1930, can find themselves
enumerated as members of their family households.</TE>
<TE>   Roxie Ogilvie, 71, of Riverside won't be listed in the 1930
census, but she has plenty to look up among an extended network of
relatives from her native Michigan, and other Midwest states. "There
are probably only 10 families I'm really interested in," Ogilvie said
last week amid the whir of microfilm reading machines in the
archives' reference room. "I'd like to see some details of people I
know who are still alive."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers Are Excited About Access to Data</TE>
<TE>   Anticipation of the 1930 release has made National Archives
officials popular speakers at genealogy clubs and libraries.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Wormser, director of archival operations in Laguna Niguel,
said that in the last year, archivists conducted 35 workshops for
libraries and genealogy groups across Southern California. "They're
quite excited--it's a major event in that the census is one of the
bedrocks upon which most genealogists do their research," Wormser
said. "We're expecting a lot of people [today]."</TE>
<TE>   Reservations are not needed, but picture IDs are required to enter
the building, Wormser said.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll be wild," said Pat Weeks of Dana Point, a retired speech
pathologist and part-time archives volunteer who plans to show up
today, normally a day off, "just to see the fun."</TE>
<TE>   About 13,000 researchers visited the Laguna Niguel archives last
year, making it the third-busiest of the 13 regional centers after
Boston, with 14,900 researchers, and Seattle, with 16,200. The
National Archives in Washington, D.C., drew 51,500. The only other
archive in California, at San Bruno in the Bay Area, drew 9,400
researchers.</TE>
<TE>   The pace of visitors to the Laguna Niguel facility, midway between
Los Angeles and San Diego, has picked up in recent weeks as
genealogists conducted pre-search to the research.</TE>
<TE>   To find a family in the 1930 census, one must know where the
family lived and then match that address to the census enumeration
districts to figure out which of the 2,200 rolls of microfilm holds
that record. The archives bought microfilmed 1930s-era editions of
directories of more than 600 cities and regions and deposited copies
in each of the reference rooms. Genealogists like Ogilvie have
already figured out which rolls they'll look at once the files are
opened.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some researchers have written off trying to use the files for
a few weeks, assuming the lines will be too long even for people with
the patience to chase history through old files.</TE>
<TE>   The reference room in Laguna Niguel contains 50 microfilm readers
and two printers, and if a line forms, Wormser said, researchers will
be limited to two hours.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll wait awhile," said Jerry Wessler, 68, who has traced threads
of his family history back to the Cherokee nation, Germany and
Scandinavia.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not in there [the 1930 census], but I want to look up my
parents and my brother. I'll just continue the lines I'm already
searching, just updating them."</TE>
<TE>   Skeleton in the Closet Is Bonus for Some</TE>
<TE>   The pursuit of family history is as Middle America as the decision
to wear sensible shoes, but some genealogists have a dark sense of
humor about the quests.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the fun, they say, is discovering skeletons in the family
closet and learning the stories that families only whisper about.</TE>
<TE>   One researcher this week volunteered that she had trouble tracking
down her mother's roots. Then she found out why: Her mother was
raised in a Midwest orphanage after her father was decapitated in a
railroad yard accident.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, another genealogist scurried across the
reference room to divulge that she had just found a page from an 1870
Lexington, Ky., census that named several women at one address with
the occupation "prostitute."</TE>
<TE>   "It's fascinating--if you like history, you'll love this," said
Weeks, who has been pursuing the past for more than 30 years. "It's
the fun of the chase."</TE>

<HD>Church Protesters Standing on Tradition</HD>
<DH>Religion: Group opposes modernization of St. Charles parish
in North Hollywood, but pastor says there is no set agenda for
changes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Outside the North Hollywood church, a handful of the faithful wear
buttons that proclaim: "Save St. Charles."</LD>
<LD>   Before and after Sunday Mass, they invite anyone going in or out
of St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church to sign their petitions. The
demonstrators have 1,000 signatures, endorsing 11 things they want
for St. Charles.</LD>
<LD>   Their wish list begins with retention of the altar at the front of
the church and ends with "Restoration of the Blessed Sacrament to its
place of honor in the Tabernacle behind the altar."</LD>
<TE>   For both the protesters and the pastor who has urged his flock to
ignore them, the weekly demonstrations hold great import. Pastor
Robert Gallagher has shown his pique in church bulletins. Meanwhile,
dozens of protesters have fallen to their knees outside the church to
recite the rosary and ask the Virgin Mary to intercede to prevent
modernization they regard as ecclesiastical vandalism.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing buttons and saying the rosary hardly sounds like the stuff
of revolution. The protesters want to keep the church's stained-glass
windows and private confessionals, not lose them.</TE>
<TE>   But the protest has roiled the parish. Last month, Gallagher
announced in the church bulletin that "there is no set agenda as to
any changes that we will make in our church" but added that "some
changes will be made."</TE>
<TE>   The protesters believe that Gallagher advocates a stripped-down
church architecture that would eliminate pews and kneelers, the
dramatic wooden crucifix behind the altar and the elaborate carved
canopy, or baldacchino, that hangs above the cross.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't really have any specific plans about what we're doing in
the church right now," Gallagher said. Rather, the congregation is
involved in "a process of education," he said, referring to a series
of talks on art, architecture and liturgy being held at the
church.The St. Charles Borromeo Preservation Guild was founded
several months ago by opponents of a radical remodel of the
Spanish-style church, dedicated in 1959 but more evocative of
Catholic churches of 100--or 1,000--years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Guild President Joe Gonzalez, 41, is a lifelong Catholic who
teaches liberal studies at Cal State Fullerton. An expert on church
ritual and architecture, his dissertation in history at UCLA compared
a Swedish Protestant church with a French Catholic church built
during the Renaissance.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez has written long, carefully worded letters to Gallagher
and archdiocesan officials arguing against changes to the church that
would make it less formal and more like the Catholic churches of the
late 1960s and '70s.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez has repeatedly pointed out that St. Charles, with its
artful Stations of the Cross, its vaulted ceiling and its hushed
focus on the altar and crucifix, has become a refuge for devout Roman
Catholics who think too many Catholic churches now look like schools
or other secular buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people, including myself, started going to St. Charles
in part because of a desire to get away from modernization," Gonzalez
said.</TE>
<TE>   Churches closer to his home in Burbank have been renovated,
apparently to reflect the liberal spirit of the Second Vatican
Council, which between 1962 and 1965 ended the all-Latin Mass and
instituted other reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Often, the pulpits were removed in such churches, Gonzalez said,
"and the priests took the microphones and walked around in the
audience. It reminds me of a talk show." But Vatican II did not
require architectural modernization, Gonzalez said. Parishioners at
St. Charles learned several months ago that a major overhaul might be
in the offing when Gallagher announced that Richard Vosko would speak
to the congregation.</TE>
<TE>   A priest with a doctorate in education, Vosko is a well-known
consultant on "sacred spaces" to churches and other religious
institutions. His clients include the Archdiocese of Los Angeles; he
is an advisor on the new cathedral being built in downtown Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   A capsule version of Vosko's views on liturgical design appear on
his Web site, www.rvosko.com: "The time-honored ingredients of a
worthy place for worship include stories of faith, pilgrimage
pathways, transforming thresholds, intimate settings for personal
prayer, artwork that prompts works of justice and seating plans that
engage the community in the public rituals."</TE>
<TE>   That philosophy has its detractors. Leading the anti-Vosko camp in
the conservative Catholic media is Michael Rose, a Cincinnati-based
author who writes scathingly about Vosko-style church redesigns in
Detroit, San Antonio, New Orleans and elsewhere. At least one
modernization, in Milwaukee, was suspended last year at the direction
of the Vatican after opponents retained a canon lawyer to plead their
case.</TE>
<TE>   Rose recently published "Ugly as Sin," a book criticizing Vosko's
work. Rose argues that great churches, such as the cathedral at
Chartres in France, are beautiful and embody church doctrine. Among
Rose's examples is the traditional confessional box of the type
protesters want to retain in North Hollywood. That style of
confessional was popularized in the 16th century by a powerful
cardinal who wrote an influential work on church architecture. His
name: St. Charles Borromeo.</TE>
<TE>   Guild members say Vosko's talk on Jan. 15 was not especially
well-received. "The reaction to him was so strong, I don't think
we'll be seeing him again," said Chuck Konzelman, a writer-producer
who worships at St. Charles.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocesan spokesman Tod Tamberg, who also attended the Vosko
talk, said guild members tried to sabotage it before it began.
Non-guild members who attended, Tamberg said, "had been told by the
people in the preservation guild that [Vosko] was coming to renovate
the church, and that's not true."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Tamberg said, Vosko had been invited to start a process
of education and discussion that is standard when a parish considers
renovation. Such a process is necessary, Tamberg said, because "you
don't start with architecture, you start with liturgy."</TE>

<HD>Woman Deputy Earns Spot as Tactical-Team Player</HD>
<DH>Law enforcement: Sue Burakowski is the first female on the
elite search-and-rescue unit. Training is rigorous.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sue Burakowski breaks new ground every time she goes to work.</LD>
<LD>   Whether it's diving through choppy water, scaling mountains or
jumping from helicopters, Burakowski is setting a new standard as the
first woman on the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's
Emergency Services Detail--essentially a SWAT team with medical
supplies that also handles demanding search-and-rescue missions.</LD>
<LD>   The 35-year-old deputy is one of only three women in the sheriff's
Special Enforcement Bureau, which in addition to the Emergency
Services Detail includes the SWAT team and mounted and canine units.</LD>
<TE>   Although the number may not sound impressive, the Sheriff's
Department is considered progressive when it comes to hiring women
for rigorous tactical units, said a spokeswoman for a national
organization that monitors women in law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Women account for nearly 14% of all sworn officers in law
enforcement nationwide, but few are members of special enforcement
units. There are only a handful on the West Coast and none on the Los
Angeles Police Department's SWAT team, the only other full-time unit
in the county.</TE>
<TE>   Women in special enforcement units say family commitments and the
job's physical rigor and strain are bigger obstacles than gender
bias.</TE>
<TE>   ''Not everyone is fit mentally and physically enough for these
jobs,'' said Cmdr. Cathy Taylor, who was the first woman in the
Special Enforcement Bureau and is now head of the custody operations
division of the Sheriff's Department. ''Even fewer want to do them
and can fit them into their lifestyles.''</TE>
<TE>   Burakowski, who lives in Long Beach with her foster son, Corey,
was the first woman to follow in Taylor's footsteps. She said the
excitement of working in a tactical unit outweighs the danger and the
strain.</TE>
<TE>   ''This job is the epitome of not knowing what you're going to do
each day,'' Burakowski said. ''Once people get this job, they stay
until they retire.''</TE>
<TE>   Burakowski traveled an arduous road on her way to becoming a
full-fledged member of the 14-person Emergency Services Detail in
February. Born in Michigan, she grew up in a Detroit suburb, majored
in criminal justice at Eastern Michigan University and planned to
join the Detroit Police Department until she discovered that the
agency's training tapes were provided by the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   ''That was the kind of agency I wanted to work for, the
cutting-edge place that makes the training tapes rather than just
using them,'' she said.</TE>
<TE>   Aspiring to join a tactical unit was a natural progression for
Burakowski, who was the first girl from her high school to win an
athletic scholarship to college, where she lettered three times on
the basketball and softball teams.</TE>
<TE>   Despite her athleticism--which Taylor said is the quickest way to
earn respect in the department--Burakowski had some struggles during
the yearlong training process to join the new unit.</TE>
<TE>   Flying in helicopters forced her to overcome a fear of heights
that she had since childhood, and on her first try she couldn't find
the strength to pull a 100-pound weight from the bottom of a swimming
pool while supervisors intermittently cut off her air supply.</TE>
<TE>   ''She told me she went in the bathroom and just cried her eyes
out, and she could just feel how disappointed the guys were,'' said
her mother, Gloria Burakowski, from her home in Sterling Heights,
Mich. ''But she just found this inner strength and went out and did
it. That's how she deals with obstacles--she doesn't try to get
around them, she beats them and moves on.''</TE>
<TE>   Taylor had recruited Burakowski for the sheriff's Special
Enforcement Bureau as part of an agencywide push to bring women into
tactical units, which have traditionally been all-male.</TE>
<TE>   Following a successful lawsuit filed in 1980 by a female deputy
who was passed over for promotion, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals ordered the Sheriff's Department to increase the number of
women in such ''coveted positions'' as command and tactical posts.</TE>
<TE>   ''[Burakowski] is so perfect for that environment,'' said Taylor,
a former SWAT commander. ''It's that reserved, observant side of her
that exudes strength.''</TE>
<TE>   Katherine Spillar, a spokeswoman for the Center for Women and
Policing, a division of the Feminist Majority think tank, said
despite Burakowski's promotion, law enforcement has not made enough
progress in increasing the number of women in those units.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's shocking that it's just now that these barriers are being
broken,'' Spillar said from the center's Los Angeles office.
''[Burakowski] should get a medal just for getting this far.''</TE>
<TE>   When Taylor joined the bureau in 1997 there was no women's
restroom in the building. But Taylor said she encountered little
animosity because of her gender.</TE>
<TE>   ''The few men who said they were never going to accept me were
outnumbered by the hundreds by those who just cared about the quality
of the work I did,'' Taylor said. ''I made it clear I was there to do
the job and not just be a showpiece for gender equality.''</TE>
<TE>   Burakowski said most men in her unit have treated her with
respect. Although no one has been overtly rude, she said some older
men ignore her, behavior that she dismisses with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   ''They'll be gone soon enough anyway, so I'm not going to get
upset that we're not all best friends,'' she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her partner, Dana Vilander, said he doesn't care if he's working
with a man or a woman, as long as he can depend on the person to save
his life.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is the most physically demanding job in law enforcement,''
said Vilander, 42, a four-year veteran of the unit. ''And if someone
can get through the physical fitness test and the hard-core training,
that speaks loudly enough for me.''</TE>
<TE>   Wearing the unit's baggy olive-</TE>
<TE>   green uniform jumpsuit and helmet, Burakowski said sometimes the
people she rescues don't realize she's a woman.</TE>
<TE>   ''I think if most people knew it was a girl coming down to snag
them, they'd freak out,'' she said, her short, blond hair flopping
around her face as she shook her head.</TE>
<TE>   The only difference between the SWAT and Emergency Services Detail
officers is that the latter carry a pack of medical supplies. At
least two officers from the detail accompany the SWAT team, often on
as many as 200 calls each year.</TE>
<TE>   Burakowski, who had knee replacement surgery four years ago, said
she expects to stay on the detail until she's 50. She's not sure what
she'd like to do in the department after that.</TE>
<TE>   ''I think I've done all the best jobs in the department,'' she
said. ''I can't imagine anything being more fun than what I do now.''</TE>

<HD>They Dare to Dream of a Downtown</HD>
<DH>Planning: Officials seek ways to retrofit bedroom community
suburbs with what older cities have--an urban core.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange officials have grown accustomed to calls from planners and
politicians curious about their famed Old Towne, and whether it is
possible to re-create the quaint urban center, with its antique
shops, soda fountain and Craftsman homes, in their own backyards.</LD>
<LD>   But a few months back, a query baffled them.</LD>
<LD>   It came from a consultant for Lake Forest, a south Orange County
city that has long prided itself on being a bedroom community where
homebuyers can flee urban hassles, stake their claim to a small lot,
maybe behind heavy iron gates. Pedestrian-friendly village centers?
Not part of the equation.</LD>
<TE>   The downtown renaissance of the last decade that transformed
cities like Orange, Brea and Huntington Beach passed right over the
suburbs of south county, where much of public life exists in malls
and strip malls. Now, many of those cities want to catch up.</TE>
<TE>   The few cities that have downtowns are looking to spruce up
neglected main streets, while others--true to south county style--are
building manicured downtowns from scratch as part of master-planned
communities.</TE>
<TE>   Lake Forest is looking to inject a dose of Old Towne Orange into
its revamping of heavily traveled El Toro Road--a reach, perhaps,
since it's a busy highway largely used to get to the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, with 60,000 cars going by, people will never want to walk
right alongside El Toro Road," said Kathy Graham, the city's
community development director. But she sees opportunities to create
pedestrian promenades that connect the large retail properties on
either side of it. "Some of the concepts that worked well in Old
Towne Orange could be incorporated," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Planners say the downtown movement is overdue in south Orange
County.</TE>
<TE>   "People are having urban experiences in other places and they like
it," said William Fulton, an urban planner and author of books about
growth in Southern California. "They return to parts of Orange County
where [downtowns] don't exist and are asking 'Why can't we have that
here?'"</TE>
<TE>   In some places, they can.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for the 3,500-acre Talega community in San Clemente include
a village center full of coffee shops, restaurants and stores that
will be within walking distance of many of the 4,000 residences that
will ultimately be built, including 300 townhomes nestled among the
stores. Even a farmers' market, long a staple of urban life, is on
the drawing board. Also within the community will be a business park
rivaling the Irvine Spectrum in size.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of marketing the development as a secluded retreat
where homeowners can barricade themselves against the outside world,
Talega Associates is selling the community as a place where the
outside world comes to you, where you don't have to drive to do
everything. It's what some planners call "soft" urbanism.</TE>
<TE>   The Rancho Mission Viejo company introduced that type of
development to the area with Rancho Santa Margarita. Now,
concentrated areas of restaurants, shops and offices are being built
in the company's 4,000-acre Ladera Ranch community, and the concept
will be a staple in the company's development plans for the 23,000
open acres it has left.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, when they look for models to re-create, they look
toward Old Towne Orange.</TE>
<TE>   "Old Towne, with its traffic circle and coffee shops, it's coming
back," said Rancho Mission Viejo spokeswoman Diane Gaynor. "The focus
is on re-creating the kind of downtowns we knew growing up."</TE>
<TE>   Victor Georgino, a developer who has worked on downtown
revitalization projects, says mimicking older cities puts a stamp of
authenticity on communities, and that comforts residents.</TE>
<TE>   "The old look tends to create a synergism with the community and
gives them the feeling of Mayberry, U.S.A.," he said. "It gives
everyone a sense of place and community."</TE>
<TE>   Purists scoff at the notion, writing off the downtowns created in
master-planned communities as merely shopping malls without roofs.</TE>
<TE>   Gaynor spins it another way: "We can combine the best parts of the
old with the best parts of the new. We have a clean palette."</TE>
<TE>   The divide between north and south Orange County, when it comes to
providing an urban experience, was evident at a recent conference of
the state Downtown Assn., held in Brea.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives from north county were there to learn about
retrofitting blighted urban centers. Experts talked about putting
lofts in warehouses, spaces where people could work and live, lining
main streets with flags, and declaring half-vacant commercial
districts redevelopment zones.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody from south county showed up, since opportunities to
retrofit are limited. Places that already have downtowns, such as San
Juan Capistrano and coastal San Clemente, are thriving by benefiting
from what was already there and not disrupting it.</TE>
<TE>   San Juan Capistrano keeps car dealerships, large retail stores and
industrial parks on the outskirts of town, away from the historic
mission, 150-year-old adobes and the picturesque train depot.
Downtown buildings are restricted to such uses as antique shops,
museums and small, independent restaurants and bars.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got certain standards in our downtown that the residents
have basically moved down here for," said San Juan Capistrano City
Councilman David M. Swerdlin.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is rushing to join the downtown boom, however.</TE>
<TE>   In Mission Viejo, where the south county building explosion
started in the 1960s, officials say re-creating Old Towne or anything
like it is not planned, nor should it be.</TE>
<TE>   The city went for a contemporary look in building its
$14.5-million City Hall, which Mayor Susan Withrow said has created
something of a town center by linking a community center, recreation
building and conference area by sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   But that's about as far as Mission Viejo is willing to go.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a bedroom community, a suburb," Withrow said. "To create
a downtown Orange isn't something that can be accomplished."</TE>

<HD>A Little-Known Past Comes Alive</HD>
<DH>History: A museum exhibit chronicles the story of the early
Jewish settlers in Ventura County.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first Jewish settlers in Ventura County came from Europe in the
1860s, seeking freedom from persecution and a golden slice of the
American dream.</LD>
<LD>   They set up banks, shoe stores, pharmacies and saloons. They
shaved their beards to blend into American society. Many kept their
businesses open on the Sabbath, sold bacon and had a Santa Claus in
their stores every Christmas.</LD>
<LD>   But few forgot where they came from, and a new exhibit at the
Ventura County Museum of History and Art chronicles that journey from
the 1860s through the 1940s. The exhibition--"Jewish Heritage &amp;
History in Ventura County"--is full of old photographs, memorabilia
and religious objects.</LD>
<TE>   "I want people to understand how hard it was to come from this
religious tradition and then arrive in a totally foreign
environment," said Diana Boydstun, curator of the exhibit. "They
lived two separate lives."</TE>
<TE>   Most Jewish settlers came from Poland, Germany, Russia or France.
At one point, an area of what is now El Rio in Oxnard was named New
Jerusalem after a store established by Simon Cohn in the early 1870s.</TE>
<TE>   Jews soon occupied prominent positions in the local business
community. French immigrant Achille Levy helped establish Hueneme
Bank in 1891 and then Bank of A. Levy, which lasted until 1994. Levy
loaned money to farmers who were just getting established, Boydstun
said.</TE>
<TE>   There was also Leon Cerf, another French immigrant, who had a
store and a saloon in downtown Ventura. And Joseph Wolfson, a cattle
and hide trader who managed the Ventura Wharf in 1875.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit has grainy black-and-white photos of early immigrant
families--the Zanders, the Cohns, the Lehmanns and the Wolfsons.</TE>
<TE>   An old wooden steamer trunk is filled with ritual implements such
as a knife used for the slaughter of animals for kosher meat. There
are also kosher bowls--one for milk, one for meat--and kosher soap
with no animal fat added.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit has large Torah scrolls, a small silver mezuza cover
to hold prayers and a cookbook with recipes for "matzo omelet, matzo
meal omelet and matzo scrambled eggs."</TE>
<TE>   Boydstun said these bits of Judaica kept the newcomers in touch
with their roots. At the same time, she said, there is nothing in the
early photographs identifying them as Jews.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted very badly to be Americans," she said. "In the old
country, the women would have had their hair covered and the men
would probably be wearing kipahs," or yarmulkes. "Christians could
not see these ritual objects because they were kept in their homes
away from people."</TE>
<TE>   The nearest synagogue was in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   After the first Jews settled in Ventura County, their friends and
relatives followed.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Moses' family fled Berlin in 1938, just a few months before
Kristallnacht, when Jewish businesses were ransacked and many Jews
killed. Moses, a retired optometrist in Port Hueneme, said Nazi storm
troopers blocked anyone from entering his father's shoe and slipper
store. Alarmed at this, Moses' uncle, George Zander, hurriedly
brought the family to Ventura County, where he owned a store.</TE>
<TE>   Moses was 10 when he came to Ventura, a sunny land of citrus
groves and sandy beaches, far from the Old World civilization and
persecution by Germany. He and his brother couldn't speak English.
The family lived in New Jerusalem before renting a house on Santa
Rosa Street for $35 a month. His father was a tailor who went to work
in Zander's clothing store.</TE>
<TE>   "From a 10-year-old perspective it was certainly a culture shock,"
said the 74-year-old Moses, who contributed photos to the exhibit.
"But you adapt very readily. People took to me and my brothers."</TE>
<TE>   Being Germans, the Moses family were considered "enemy aliens"
during World War II, and a Ventura police officer, Dewey Phillips,
was assigned to visit them each week to make sure they weren't
spying.</TE>
<TE>   "He got very friendly with my grandmother," Moses said. "He was
right out of central casting. He wore a derby and would come over and
have cookies and coffee. It was odd to be considered enemy aliens,
because we felt we were the first victims of Hitler."</TE>
<TE>   Temple Beth Torah was founded in Ventura in 1938. There are now
five Jewish congregations in Ventura County and more than 53,000
Jews, according to the Jewish Federations of Ventura and Los Angeles
counties.</TE>
<TE>   Moses said the new exhibit will give local Jews a sense of pride.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of [present-day] Jews didn't realize there were Jewish
families living here in the 19th century," he said. "This new
generation is more intensely Jewish. They are doctors and lawyers,
and we were all merchants."</TE>
<TE>   Another part of the exhibit, which ends May 26, is a series of
lectures on Judaism. Rabbi John Sherwood of Oxnard will deliver a
talk titled "Everything You Wanted to Know About Judaism But Were
Afraid to Ask" at 7 p.m. April 11.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pleased that the Ventura County Jewish community has taken
the opportunity to share its contributions with the people with whom
we live," Sherwood said. "I believe that the lecture series will
provide people of all faiths an excellent opportunity for growth,
both intellectually and spiritually."</TE>
<TE>   Other lectures include "Jews of Nazi-Occupied Europe Who Settled
in the Ventura Area" and "Mozel Tov! Exploring the Jewish Wedding."</TE>
<TE>   Boydstun, who has curated other local Jewish exhibits, hopes
people will gain a deeper appreciation of local Jewish culture from
the exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful thing to know one's roots, no matter what your
roots are," she said. "It doesn't matter if you are Jewish, Catholic
or Buddhist."</TE>

<HD>Honey Business Is Sweet--and Sour</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: California is again the nation's No. 1
producer. But industry faces swarm of troubles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California beekeepers managed to pump out enough nectar last year to
reestablish the Golden State as the nation's top honey producer. But
at honeybee farms throughout the state, there has been little comfort
in recapturing the crown.</LD>
<LD>   Though honey prices are higher than they've been in years, the
industry faces a swarm of troubles, from cutthroat competition by
foreign exporters to voracious pests that can gut production and
drive beekeepers out of business.</LD>
<LD>   Then there are more immediate concerns, such as an ongoing dry
spell sure to shrink the amount of vegetation available this year for
honeybees to feed.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of Agriculture may count California as No. 1,
but veteran beekeepers say the view from the top can be precarious.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't paint too rosy a picture, because it's not," said Red
Bennett, a 60-year-old former NASA engineer who two dozen years ago
surrendered his pursuit of space travel for flight operations closer
to earth in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   "Beekeeping is pretty tough, and it has become quite difficult to
stay in business," said Bennett, one of the few commercial beekeepers
left in a county once home to a thriving industry. "And right now,
it's looking pretty bleak."</TE>
<TE>   Although honey production was lower than the year before,
California beekeepers still reaped 28 million pounds of the golden
nectar in 2001, accounting for one-seventh of the nation's production
and edging out longtime rival North Dakota for top honors.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a decade, the two states--along with South Dakota
and Florida--have been locked in a nip-and-tuck battle for
honey-making preeminence.</TE>
<TE>   Like California, those states have plenty of flowering grasses,
plants and trees on which honeybees like to feed.</TE>
<TE>   But California has emerged as the top producer in seven of the
last nine years, driven largely by good weather and a bountiful
supply of sources available for bees to produce honey.</TE>
<TE>   From the fragrant fruit orchards of the San Joaquin Valley to the
just-blossoming orange groves around Ventura, nearly half a million
colonies are busy each year serving up the sweet syrup--a crop valued
at $18.5 million in 2001. That is its highest value since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Tulare County Leads in Honey Production</TE>
<TE>   Tulare County leads California in honey production, followed by
Riverside, Kings, Kern and Merced counties.</TE>
<TE>   The bees play a vital role in California agriculture, and are
brought in by growers to pollinate everything from almonds to summer
squash in an effort to boost yields and quality.</TE>
<TE>   But like farming as a whole, it's an industry confronted by
challenges and coping with change.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps as few as 350 beekeepers statewide now take part in the
profession. That represents about a 25% reduction over the last
decade, as smaller producers have been shooed away by pestilence,
plummeting prices and other problems.</TE>
<TE>   The same holds true nationally.</TE>
<TE>   Domestic honey production nationwide has decreased 20% over the
last decade.</TE>
<TE>   And despite a recent run of higher prices, spurred in part by a
decision to levy tariffs against foreign exporters, many U.S.
producers still find themselves struggling just to break even.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gone through some tough stretches," said Lyle Johnston, a
third-generation Colorado beekeeper and president of the 900-member
American Honey Producers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "Beekeeping has changed so much in the last 20 years, and the
industry has really shrunken," he said. "I think all you'll find
anymore are the die-hards working at it."</TE>
<TE>   That appears to be true in California.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Mussen, a honeybee expert at UC Davis, said not only are
there fewer honey producers today than there were 10 years ago, but
many of those who remain are veterans of the trade, rugged
individualists unburdened by such conventions as time clocks or
production schedules.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble is, there aren't a whole lot of younger beekeepers waiting
to take their place, no new generation ready--or willing--to take on
traditions that date back thousands of years.</TE>
<TE>   Add to that a trend toward consolidation, with larger operations
cornering a growing share of the honey market, and the result is an
industry barreling toward an uncertain future.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say it's tenuously holding its own at the moment," said
Mussen, who works with beekeepers throughout the state under the
University of California's cooperative extension program.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's not too different from what you see in farming overall,"
he said. "I think there are a lot of [beekeepers] who would be more
than happy to turn the reins over to somebody else. The question
becomes, who--if anybody--is going to take over?"</TE>
<TE>   Out in California's honeybee heartland, Tulare County beekeeper
Max Eggman learned the trade as a child. His father and older brother
worked with bees. And Eggman joined the profession when he left the
Marine Corps in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   Creating a Profitable Niche in the Market</TE>
<TE>   Now, at 72, he's managed to carve a profitable niche in the honey
market, competing with larger producers by selling the sweet stuff at
roadside stands and San Francisco farmers markets.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he knows his industry is in decline. Managing 600 to 700
hives, he said it has become harder to compete with larger
operations, which truck hives by the thousands to places where nectar
is plentiful.</TE>
<TE>   And there's not a lot of money to be made, especially for
newcomers who would likely need to go in debt to get off the ground.</TE>
<TE>   None of Eggman's three children chose to follow him into the
field.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a dwindling industry, no question," said Eggman, who
operates out of the tiny community of Terra Bella, south of
Porterville.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see it being a dead end. I just think it will be harder
and harder to be prosperous."</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, a small band of beekeepers helps keep alive an
industry that first arrived in the late 1800s, a time before citrus
hit its heyday and when bees were more profitable than cattle.</TE>
<TE>   Just two decades ago, there were enough beekeepers to support a
countywide association of honey producers, but the group disbanded
about 10 years ago as smaller producers fell away.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even though fewer than a dozen commercial producers remain,
they've been a busy bunch.</TE>
<TE>   Honey production and its value more than tripled from 1999 to
2000, according to Ventura County's annual crop report. Beekeepers
also nearly doubled the amount of money generated from renting hives
to growers for pollination.</TE>
<TE>   Like others around the state, Ojai Valley beekeeper Brian Cox has
learned there are other ways to make money off bees.</TE>
<TE>   Cox, 46, became a full-time beekeeper about 10 years ago, moving
to Ojai in 1993 with 300 hives and a direct-marketing approach to
pushing his products--honey, skin cream and lip balm--at farmers
markets locally and in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But he also started searching out farmers who could benefit from
the pollination his bees could provide, a service that has become
increasingly important as pests and other problems have decimated
feral bee populations.</TE>
<TE>   Like honey producers nationwide, Cox is in the process of
retrieving hives rented to farmers in the San Joaquin Valley, where
upward of 1 million hives are trucked in annually to pollinate that
region's almond orchards. With that pollination period wrapping up,
Cox's bees already are booked to provide the same service for Ventura
County avocado growers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the biggest deal for beekeepers," Cox said of the hive
rentals, which supplement honey production of about 30,000 pounds a
year. "It's basically what has kept beekeeping alive."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, beekeepers and honeybee experts say, no factor is more
important to the industry than the one they have least control over:
the weather.</TE>
<TE>   Just last month, some Northern California beekeepers reported
losing more than 40% of their hives as a late-season cold snap
settled on Sacramento Valley crops where bees were being used for
pollination.</TE>
<TE>   And still looming are the effects of a prolonged dry spell certain
to reduce the amount of sage and other flowering plants on which
honeybees feed.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County honey farmer Bennett is doing what he can to get
by. Along with his wife, Ann, he has been able to carve his own niche
in the industry by processing and distributing honey for other
beekeepers.</TE>
<TE>   Millions of Bees Arrive During Springtime</TE>
<TE>   His busiest season is approaching, as springtime signals the
arrival of millions of bees from around the country brought to
Ventura County to flit among the avocados and the ever-fragrant
orange blossoms.</TE>
<TE>   Working out of a mothballed egg ranch north of Moorpark, where he
set up shop after fire wiped out his Piru Canyon honeybee farm in
October 2000, he pumps out on average about 200 tons of honey a year
for himself and others.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to diversify the business in order to stay in business,"
said Bennett, who has seen plenty of other honey producers fall by
the wayside, unable to sustain themselves on prices as low a few
years ago as they were when he first got into the business.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if you get a good crop, you're not guaranteed to make any
money," he said. "'But we're going to keep working at it because I
decided a long time ago I was done working in an office."</TE>

<HD>Kidnapping Victim Found Gagged in Motel; Six Arrested</HD>
<DH>Crime: The businessman, who was tied to a bed, is treated
for dehydration after a nearly two-week abduction. A ransom was
allegedly demanded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A shaken Huntington Beach businessman was found safe but dehydrated
in a Long Beach motel after being held for nearly two weeks by
kidnappers, and six people have been arrested, Huntington Beach
police said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   FBI agents and police discovered Sohiel B. Daliri, also known as
Bernard Daliri, 37, tied to a bed, blindfolded and gagged with duct
tape at Don's Motel on Pacific Coast Highway on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   They said they found Daliri by following two suspects after a
meeting with the victim's girlfriend to discuss a ransom pickup, said
Police Lt. William Stuart.</LD>
<TE>   The victim suffered no outward injuries but was taken to a
hospital for dehydration. Police, who said Daliri knew his
kidnappers, also said they were surprised he had survived the ordeal.</TE>
<TE>   "We had some police officers with 20 or more years of experience
and these guys were stunned because they said it was like something
that you see off the TV," Stuart said. "He was bound ... and had tape
over his eyes and mouth."</TE>
<TE>   Five men were arrested on suspicion of kidnapping for ransom,
including Erick Velazquez, 20, of Rancho Santa Margarita, who police
said was found inside the motel room with Daliri.</TE>
<TE>   The other four were Brian D. Dumas, 28, of Huntington Beach; Esau
Abrajan, 18, of Rancho Santa Margarita; Nasir B. Shamsi, 40, of
Placentia; and Brian D. Good, 27, of Huntington Beach. They were
taken to Huntington Beach Jail and being held on $250,000 bail each.</TE>
<TE>   The sixth suspect, a juvenile, was arrested in Lakewood on
suspicion of auto theft and hit-and-run while allegedly driving
Daliri's car six days after he was kidnapped.</TE>
<TE>   Police gave a partial accounting of events and the arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Daliri was abducted March 18 from a home he owned in Orange but
did not live in. His girlfriend, whom police would not identify,
reported him missing the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Eight days after the abduction, the first two of the five adult
suspects were arrested by Riverside County sheriff's deputies while
driving a truck rented with Daliri's credit card. It was reported
stolen after it was not returned on time.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve days passed before kidnappers called the girlfriend, on
Saturday, to arrange a meeting. At the meeting, at least one
kidnapper told the girlfriend Daliri would be harmed if a ransom
weren't paid.</TE>
<TE>   Police would only say the kidnappers wanted an amount in the range
of $500 to $30,000.</TE>
<TE>   After the meeting, police said, they tailed Good and another
suspect, following them through Seal Beach and Huntington Beach and
stopping at the Long Beach motel.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they eventually arrested the pair at Good's apartment
in Huntington Beach, and returned to the motel later, where they
found Daliri.</TE>
<TE>   Police would not describe Daliri's connection with the suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "He was not selected as a target of this because he's a
multimillionaire or a prominent businessman or person. But he was
selected because of a link with him and the suspects," Stuart said.</TE>
<TE>   Daliri owns two heating and air-conditioning shops, in Fullerton
and Orange, and he sold a Huntington Beach gas station two years ago,
according to records.</TE>

<HD>Rafael A. Lafferty, 87; Wrote Historical and Science
Fiction</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rafael A. Lafferty, prolific writer of historical fiction and science
fiction known for his short stories as well as his novels, has died.
He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Lafferty, who spent much of his life in Oklahoma and often wrote
about Native Americans, died March 18 in Broken Arrow, Okla., of
undisclosed causes.</LD>
<LD>   His output included 21 novels and more than 200 short stories,
among them satirical tales pondering what would happen if everybody
in the world owned a gun or describing the consequences of fads that
lasted a single day or of a child's camera that makes things
disappear.</LD>
<TE>   Lafferty earned the Hugo Award from the World Science Fiction
Society in 1973 for his short story "Eurema's Damn."</TE>
<TE>   Among Lafferty's historical novels was the 1972 "Okla Hannali" set
among Choctaw Indians in the 19th century.</TE>
<TE>   "Falsehoods and cliches about Indians and the American West die
sprawling all along Lafferty's path," wrote a Times book reviewer,
"and this noble carnage is what elevates the book, makes it more than
a charmingly told family chronicle."</TE>
<TE>   Lafferty, a Roman Catholic, often included theological themes in
his writing as well as elements of folk tales and even dreams.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1971 science fiction novel "The Devil Is Dead," a reader
has trouble identifying the devil in the struggle for control of
humanity between the "Demons" who are descended from aliens and the
"Elder Race" of pre-humans.</TE>
<TE>   As "A Reader's Guide to Fantasy" once noted, "Lafferty doesn't see
the world in quite the same way that most people do; his logic is
rigorous, but his premises are deadpan insanity."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Neola, Iowa, Rafael Aloysius Lafferty moved to Perry,
Okla., with his family at age 4 and later settled in Tulsa. He
attended the University of Tulsa for one year, but was mostly
self-educated.</TE>
<TE>   He served in the Army during World War II and worked for many
years in Tulsa's Clark Electrical Supply Co. before beginning to
write in middle age.</TE>
<TE>   His first story was published in 1959 and his first novel nine
years later.</TE>
<TE>   Lafferty, a bachelor, left no immediate survivors.</TE>

<HD>Mauling Verdict Criticized</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>The man recently convicted along with his wife in the dog-mauling
death of their neighbor last year said that he was not surprised by
his conviction, but accused the prosecutors and judge of political
maneuvering</LD>
<LD>   Robert Noel also told the San Jose Mercury News in an interview
from San Francisco Jail on Friday that expressing remorse would not
have made a difference in his or his wife's convictions. Noel and his
wife, Marjorie Knoller, have been criticized for appearing
insensitive to the death of Diane Whipple, 33.</LD>
<LD>   "I saw where the jurors said, 'They didn't show any remorse,' but
by definition remorse is an admission of guilt," Noel said. "Besides,
what could I possibly say to this woman's family? That their daughter
had just died in a horrible fashion? What relevance would there be to
any words I could say?"</LD>
<TE>   Noel also said he and his wife fear prison officials may try to
have them killed. The couple, who are lawyers, have filed many
lawsuits on behalf of inmates and have criticized California prison
officials.</TE>
<TE>   The couple's two large Presa Canarios fatally mauled Whipple in
her apartment building on Jan. 26, 2001. Knoller and Noel, who kept
the dogs for two California prison inmates, contended that they had
no idea the dogs would turn into killers.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller, who was present when the dogs attacked, was convicted of
second-degree murder. She also was found guilty, along with Noel--who
was not around during the attack--of the lesser charges of
manslaughter and having a mischievous dog that killed someone.</TE>
<TE>   Noel, 60, has been in jail for a year since the attack. He could
face four years in prison and Knoller, 46, could get 15 years to life
at their sentencing May 10.</TE>

<HD>Ed Turner, 66; TV Newsman Helped CNN Upstart Gain Respect</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ed Turner, 66, who helped establish CNN as a respected major news
organization, died Saturday of liver cancer in George Washington
University Hospital in Washington, D.C.</LD>
<LD>   Turner was hired in 1980 as one of the first news professionals
brought into the fledgling network. The fact that he coincidentally
shared the last name of CNN founder Ted Turner earned him the
nickname "No Relation" Turner, which he had printed on matchbooks he
distributed from his office.</LD>
<LD>   Ed Turner retired in 1998 as vice president in charge of
newsgathering and tried unsuccessfully to launch California News
Service, a smaller version of CNN. He worked for the Freedom Forum, a
nonprofit journalism organization, and had been co-writing a history
of CNN with former correspondent Peter Arnett.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Bartlesville, Okla., and educated in journalism at the
University of Oklahoma, Turner joined KWTV, the CBS affiliate in
Oklahoma City, as a reporter and anchor. He later worked as a
producer for "CBS Morning News" and for WTTG in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   He said starting CNN was a "challenge too great not to have a go
at it."</TE>

<HD>Experimental Radar to Be Tested for Use in Searches,
Rescues</HD>
<DH>Technology: NASA plans trial flight over forest where a
small plane is believed to have crashed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An effort to tap advanced aerospace technology to conduct
search-and-rescue operations over rugged mountains and other remote
areas will be tested today over San Bernardino National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   A DC-8 aircraft equipped with an experimental radar that can see
through trees and bushes will fly over the forest looking for a small
private plane that has been missing for nearly a year.</LD>
<LD>   The scheduled test is the outgrowth of efforts by San Bernardino
County Sheriff's Lt. Mike Tuttle, who is president of the National
Assn. for Search and Rescue.</LD>
<TE>   Tuttle persuaded the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
to test the new radar over the crash site.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't realize that not everyone dies on impact, and that
there are many times when we just can't flat locate them because of
the terrain or because the brush is so thick," he said. "With this
technology, we'll be able to locate them right away."</TE>
<TE>   Under the NASA plan, the DC-8, with a crew of 20 and filled with
computers and other electronic equipment, will crisscross the
mountains for nine hours. The plane will fly out of NASA's Dryden
Flight Research Center near Mojave.</TE>
<TE>   The flight, which will begin tonight and cover a 360-square-mile
area, will gather data that will be used to refine the system so that
one day search-and-rescue teams can use the radar on a regular basis,
said Walter Klein, NASA's mission director for the radar test.</TE>
<TE>   In June, a Piper Archer II piloted by 24-year-old Daniel Katz
disappeared somewhere over the Lytle Creek area of the San Gabriel
Mountains, part of the San Bernardino National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   Extensive ground and aerial searches failed to turn up any clues
to the plane's whereabouts or the pilot's fate. The search was
hampered by rugged terrain and an extensive tree canopy.</TE>
<TE>   NASA and San Bernardino County sheriff's officials said today's
flight is mainly intended to test the radar for future use in search
and rescue efforts. The test will be completed early Tuesday morning.
"If the system functions as designed, we may find our missing
aircraft," Tuttle said.</TE>
<TE>   Known as a synthetic aperture radar, the system can discern
man-made objects even if covered under heavy foliage. Developed
initially for spy agencies, the radar has been gaining attention for
use in studying the environment as well as for use in
search-and-rescue efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Klein said data gathered during the flight will be used to refine
computer software so the system can "decipher between an old
refrigerator and an aircraft."</TE>
<TE>   Tuttle said the program began with a chance meeting in July. He
flew to Washington, D.C., to talk to NASA employees about using the
radar for search and rescue, but during the meeting, then-NASA
director Daniel Goldin walked into the room and began hearing
Tuttle's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he believed in the system and directed the employees to
work with me right there on the spot," Tuttle said.</TE>

<HD>Mineta's Pals Are Offended by Op-Ed Lashing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Norman Y. Mineta (whose name now adorns the airport in his old
district, San Jose) has been transformed from a Democratic member of
Congress to secretary of transportation and the only Dem in George
Bush's cabinet.</LD>
<LD>   After Sept. 11, that got to be a much bigger job than either
Mineta or Bush probably imagined, but his old Capitol Hill colleagues
are still sticking up for him.</LD>
<LD>   A letter circulated by Atherton Democrat Anna G. Eshoo and signed
by 54 other members asks the White House to issue a "public
denunciation" of an op-ed in publications called Jewish World Review
and Front Page Magazine.</LD>
<TE>   The column bangs away at the administration's airport security
policy for not relying on ethnic profiling, and lambastes Mineta as a
man who gets choice government jobs "solely and exclusively because
he is a minority."</TE>
<TE>   Mineta spent World War II in a Japanese internment camp and
remembers having his baseball bat taken away because it could be used
as a weapon. "A guard took Mineta's baseball bat as a child," the
column said, "and as a result he's subjecting all of America to the
Bataan Death March!"</TE>
<TE>   The congressional letter condemns the "racist and hateful
language" of the piece and asked President Bush to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   And who is this wordsmith? Ann Coulter, a sometimes-darling of
conservatives who--well, let's just say she parted company with the
National Review online publication over her prose exhortation that in
the war on terrorism, the United States should "invade their
countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity."</TE>
<TE>   Government Holiday Is Study in Confusion</TE>
<TE>   Hail Cesar--but what comes next, no one seems to know.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second year of the state's official Cesar Chavez
holiday, a paid holiday on March 31--celebrated today this year
because March 31 was a Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante marked the holiday by letting the world
know he'd be working with the United Farm Workers, the union founded
by Chavez, to let former farm workers know that thousands in
unclaimed pension benefits may be awaiting them.</TE>
<TE>   That's nice, but what was on the minds of most government
employees in California was another day off. Some government employee
unions are just dropping Columbus Day as a holiday and adding Chavez
Day, which has worked some Italian Americans into a lather.</TE>
<TE>   In Fresno, Superior Court workers are peeved that they have to go
to work today even though the courthouse will be closed and judges
and other county workers are off. That's because when their union
negotiated their last contract, the Chavez holiday wasn't on the
calendar. A union official said the court agreed to give its staff
the Chavez holiday off if the staff would work Lincoln's Birthday,
another holiday for the courts but not for other county workers.</TE>
<TE>   Are you with us so far?</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, lawyers at the city attorney's office observed the
holiday last Monday, probably for some contractual reasons; many of
them ended up going to work anyway, because the courts were still
open--and all of their support staff were working too.</TE>
<TE>   The support staff and the city attorneys will be working
today--they get a day off for the dead-white-European-male holiday,
Columbus Day, even though the attorneys do not.</TE>
<TE>   But the courts are closed.</TE>
<TE>   As one city attorney put it, "Let's hope our homeland security
isn't coordinated like this."</TE>
<TE>   Simon Declaration Doesn't Hold Water</TE>
<TE>   Here in California, water has been a fighting word since, oh,
sometime between 1492 and 1849. Drought cycles have been altering the
landscape and the economy since long before California was even a
gleam in the nation's eye, much less a star on its flag.</TE>
<TE>   So it is understandable that more than a few eyebrows were hoisted
at a news release from Republican gov candidate Bill Simon, bragging
that Simon had "first called attention to the state's potential water
shortfall in June of 2001."</TE>
<TE>   The release was couched as a backhanded compliment to Sen. Dianne
Feinstein for being yet another Democrat "parroting" a Simon
declaration, this one "nine months after [Simon] first warned of an
impending water crisis."</TE>
<TE>   We did a little digging--and a little is all it took--and found
that Feinstein, who was born in California, was warning about water
problems back when she ran against Pete Wilson for governor. That was
in 1990--about the same time that Simon moved to California.</TE>
<TE>   Let's Hear It For Mrs. Calderon</TE>
<TE>   The news release from Montebello Democratic Assemblyman Thomas M.
Calderon extolled the virtues of the Montebello school district board
member being honored as a California woman of the year for laboring
on behalf of education in Calderon's district.</TE>
<TE>   Her name is Marcella Calderon, and in the third paragraph, we
learn what we might have suspected--she is the assemblyman's wife.</TE>
<TE>   Now, don't get riled; this is a good thing, and a distinct
improvement because Calderon's brother, Charles, a former state
senator, had a very bad and very public relationship with his
ex-wife, going so far as to wear a wire for Montebello police to get
his ex-wife's fiance charged with trying to extort $100,000 from
[Charles] Calderon, threatening to reveal some alleged misuse of
campaign funds. (For the record, Calderon, now retired from the state
Senate, was fined a total of $33,000 in 1995 and 2001 for campaign
finance violations, including personal spending on items like a Lake
Tahoe trip and $298 for his first wife's modeling photos.)</TE>
<TE>   Moderate Group Ponies Up for Simon</TE>
<TE>   Can't they all just get along? Evidently, yes, at least for a few
hours.</TE>
<TE>   A big kiss-and-make-up gala in Orange County's Monarch Beach
reconciled gov nominee Bill Simon to Orange County's Republicans for
a New Majority, the rich-and-renegade arts and high-tech crowd that
had backed former L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   About 500 people showed up in black-tie uniform--perhaps drawn,
truth be told, by guest speaker Arnold Schwarzenegger, who
predictably told them he couldn't wait to say, "Hasta la vista, baby"
to Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Helping to heal the wounds: $100,000 for Simon's campaign from New
Majority's 105 members. Still undiagnosed: how Simon, who calls
himself a Reagan conservative, matches up with the group's mission to
back more moderate Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   The only possible pebbles in all those Gucci shoes was a pending
lawsuit by several New Majority leaders against two of its former and
highflying members, Henry Samueli and Henry Nicholas. They had not
only joined the New Majority, they'd invested in a Samueli-Nicholas
outfit called Broadcom, whose stock flatlined from $274 a share to
$18.77. Compared to that kind of missing moolah, the friction between
Simon and the Riordan-lovers was mere piffle.</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Spell check watch: a news release from the Governor Gray Davis
Committee quoted the Grayster as saying, "We now have the strongest
pro-choice statues of any state." (Our statue of
choice--Michelangelo's "David.")</TE>
<TE>   * Karen Hanretty, lately the press secretary of Senate GOP leader
Jim Brulte, is the new press secretary to the California GOP, where
her old boss swings a big stick as an ally of Gerald L. Parsky, who
is President Dubya's top ops man in California.</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great position for people of either gender who want to
protect democracy and freedom, including the freedom to make idiotic
statements like that."</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Bill Jones--rancher, calf-roper, regular winner
of the state legislative rodeo and accomplished typist. We asked
Jones to comment on a remark by a Republican national committeeman
from Michigan, Chuck Yob, who said women are well suited to be
secretary of state: "That's a real nice place on the ticket for a
woman. They like that kind of work."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Give Magic the assist: Was it just a year ago that Gray Davis was
endorsing the mayoral candidacy of Antonio Villaraigosa, and Magic
Johnson was putting on a full-court press for rival Jim Hahn? Yes,
indeed--and now Johnson has endorsed Davis' second run for the
governorship. And, who knows, if the former Lakers basketball star
decides to take on Hahn in 2005--as has been bruited about since Hahn
let down Magic's team by not backing a second term for Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks--Davis might be able to return the favor.</TE>

<DH>Arts: Ojai marionette program aims to help students at risk

<LD>On a stage at Chaparral Continuation High School, Miguel Gonzalez
concentrates on the mass of strings before him. Tug on this one and
Tara the Ant's mouth moves. Pull that one to bat her eyelashes.</LD>
<LD>   Patrick Kraft, who wears a Mohawk, ripped clothes and metal studs
and spikes, hovers intently above Castor, a cheerful lizard dressed
in an iridescent robe.</LD>
<LD>   And manning the strings for Holly, a sweet-voiced prairie mouse,
is Povl Rueger, a tough-talking kid from Bakersfield sent to this
Ojai school to straighten up.</LD>
<TE>   These unlikely puppeteers are part of a new student-run marionette
company at the continuation school--the place where high school
students typically go when they get in trouble or fall behind in
their classes.</TE>
<TE>   The project, a partnership with the Ojai Valley Land Conservancy,
aims to educate the community about environmental and social issues
while giving these at-risk teenagers an opportunity to create art.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think I would like it. It seemed kind of lame," said
Miguel, 16. "But now I'm into it. And I'm a part of something."</TE>
<TE>   The group, called Imaginaryum, spent last week rehearsing for its
debut production, a play in honor of farm labor advocate Cesar
Chavez, which they will perform for the community this afternoon as
part of a Cesar Chavez Day celebration.</TE>
<TE>   Featuring six marionettes that were handcrafted by the Olde World
Puppet Theater in Portland, Ore., the show tells the story of a
fictional meeting between the late Chavez and five animal characters.
The characters travel in the "Topa-Luna Open Space Ship," which is
powered by the moon and the "pink moments" for which Ojai's sunsets
are known.</TE>
<TE>   They meet Chavez in an Ojai meadow while they are out gathering
food.</TE>
<TE>   Through their interactions, the characters impart some of Chavez's
values--from nonviolence to respect for life--as required by the
state grant that funded the bulk of the project, said Pete Johnson,
an education coordinator at the conservancy.</TE>
<TE>   The partnership between the school district and the conservancy
has also received funding from the city of Ojai, Ojai Valley Youth
Foundation and other local groups. Animators, sound experts and
puppeteers from California Institute of the Arts in Valencia have
helped the students put the performance together.</TE>
<TE>   After the Cesar Chavez production, the conservancy will continue
using the five animal puppets--which also include a quail named
Quilly and a slug named Professor Salt N. Puff--to illustrate
messages to schoolchildren about the importance of open space and the
environment.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson came up with the idea after seeing a show put on by the
Olde World Puppet Theater. "I think this is a great vessel for
education," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chaparral Principal Steve Olsen said he has seen a difference in
the students. "They have more of a sense of responsibility, and they
have more self-esteem," he said. "I would say many of them might not
even be at school right now if it wasn't for this program."</TE>
<TE>   During the last two months, 10 Chaparral students have written a
script, learned how to work their respective puppets and created a
set for the production. Last week, Johnson and the play's director,
Beth Peterson, took them on a trip to CalArts to record the
characters' voices.</TE>
<TE>   Chaparral students Erica Sandefur, 19, and Christal Sharp, 16,
said the experience has opened up doors for them.</TE>
<TE>   "When we went to CalArts, I couldn't believe what I saw, and now I
really want to go there," Sandefur said. "I never thought of going to
college before--ever."</TE>
<TE>   Sparking an interest in the arts is one of the project's primary
goals, Johnson said, which is precisely why he wanted to work with
teenagers considered at risk of dropping out.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can get them doing something artistic and creative, it can
draw them back and give them another way to connect."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A community festival, "Kids Connecting with the Community," will
be held today from 4 to 7 p.m. in the auditorium and courtyard of
Chaparral Continuation High School, 414 E. Ojai Ave. The
student-produced marionette show will be presented at 4:30 p.m., 5:30
p.m., when a Spanish translation will be available, and 6:30 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Rowing Welcomes Women, and Gives Scholarships Too</HD>
<DH>Athletics: A sport that was considered elite is passing the
oars to more young people of both sexes, but it's a tough row to
master.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When former UCLA rower Amika Maran set out to start a rowing program
for teenagers in 1995, she ran into a significant problem:</LD>
<LD>   She couldn't recruit enough girls to fill a shell--and she only
needed eight. So Maran enlisted the help of some of UCLA's
better-looking male rowers.</LD>
<LD>   "I was student teaching at Santa Monica High School ... at the
time and I was trying to get girls to join, so I brought in some of
the cute guys from the rowing teams to talk about the sport," Maran
said.</LD>
<TE>   Such theatrics aren't needed anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to a combination of increased interest, media attention and
federal guidelines governing gender equality in college athletics,
rowing, which often has been viewed as an Ivy League tradition, is
gathering quite a following in the land of surfers and volleyball
players.</TE>
<TE>   The Junior Program at Marina del Rey has 65 members, boys and
girls who are among hundreds of boisterous young athletes across
Southern California trying their luck at a sport they say tests
strength and stamina and forms strong bonds.</TE>
<TE>   It's the type of sport where "you don't need any previous
experience to get real good at it, but it's tough so you can't wuss
out," said Zahra Dossa, 17, a member of the program Maran founded.</TE>
<TE>   Coaches say the popularity of such programs shows that rowing is
appealing to a wider group of people, many of them girls, in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say rowing is new on the West Coast. The University
of Washington and UC Berkeley have traditionally been dominant on the
national collegiate rowing scene.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to get away from that mind-set that it's a snooty,
prep-school thing," said Paul Wilkins, southwest regional field
service coordinator for USRowing, the national governing body for the
sport. "It's accessible to everybody."</TE>
<TE>   The cost to participate can be high, however. Junior rowers at the
Marina Aquatic Center in Marina del Rey pay about $1,300 in yearly
dues. Three of those rowers rely on 50% scholarships. The Long Beach
Junior Crew calls for a $700 yearly fee, which does not include trips
or uniform costs.</TE>
<TE>   USRowing's southwest region includes California, Utah, New Mexico,
Arizona, Hawaii and Colorado. Of the 2,863 members in the region,
only 206 live outside California. It's unclear how many are from Los
Angeles County, but rowing has traditionally been more popular in
Northern California, where more sites with calm water are available.</TE>
<TE>   It was that unpredictable Southern California surf that kept the
Marina Aquatic Center junior rowers off the water during a recent
practice. Instead, athletes worked out on rowing machines, called
ergometers or "ergs," which calculate their speed.</TE>
<TE>   The rowers worked solo, but every now and then--perhaps by
coincidence or instinct--they found a similar rhythm and fell into
sync.</TE>
<TE>   As their peers rowed, the rest of the girls' team compared erg
times and joked about how little their classmates knew about their
sport.</TE>
<TE>   "You say 'I do crew' and people think you're talking about lights
and sound for the play!" said one girl as the others laughed.</TE>
<TE>   Their schoolmates might be surprised to learn that the Junior
Program has about 35 girls, ages 13 to 18. And at the Newport Aquatic
Center Junior Rowing Club in Newport Beach, there are about 100
rowers, boys and girls.</TE>
<TE>   Popularity of Sport Growing in Region</TE>
<TE>   Newport used to take any kid who signed up, but this year the club
had to start holding tryouts, said Christy Shaver, one of the girls'
coaches.</TE>
<TE>   The Long Beach Junior Crew is going through some of the same
changes. "We're probably at our limit," said head Coach Ian Simpson.
There are 95 boys and girls on the team.</TE>
<TE>   Coaches and rowers said some of the interest is fueled by the
relatively new college scholarship opportunities the sport offers
women. In an effort to abide by federal guidelines governing gender
equality in athletics, colleges have expanded rowing teams or
upgraded them from private clubs to university-funded programs.</TE>
<TE>   To stay in compliance, schools must provide a proportionate number
of facilities and scholarships for men's and women's sports, among
other requirements. Rowing teams provide a simple, relatively
affordable way for colleges to comply with the regulations; 140
colleges are now known to have women's teams.</TE>
<TE>   "Rowing has become the female equivalent of football" in awarding
scholarships to women, Shaver said.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps the biggest push toward more recognition came in 1997,
when the NCAA made women's rowing a championship sport.</TE>
<TE>   "It's made a huge difference," said UCLA head Coach Amy Fuller.
"It puts it up there with an elite group of sports."</TE>
<TE>   Just this year, UCLA began phasing in 20 full scholarships for
women rowers. USC also offers 20 such scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents have been eager to have their daughters take
advantage of such scholarship opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Father Encouraged Participation in Crew</TE>
<TE>   Megan Biging, 17, has been rowing with the Marina Aquatic Center's
junior program for two years. She was an accomplished volleyball
player and swimmer looking to take up another sport, but rowing
didn't appeal to her. Her father had other ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad, he forced me," Megan said after practice one day. "It was
mostly because of the opportunities for scholarships. He said there's
lots of money for women in rowing."</TE>
<TE>   In Megan's case, father knew best. The Notre Dame Academy senior
became hooked on the sport and is getting the attention of college
recruiters from around the country.</TE>
<TE>   The painful calluses and blisters she has on her hands are a small
price to pay, Megan said, for the sense of achievement she feels
after every race.</TE>
<TE>   "Your legs, shoulders, arms are burning," she said. "You open your
mouth and the cold air dries up your throat. It's just this feeling
that you've worked your absolute hardest."</TE>
<TE>   Megan and the rest of the varsity women's eight-person crew placed
third out of six at last month's Southern California Cup II
championship. A year ago, they came in last.</TE>
<TE>   The competitions, known as regattas, are subdued compared with
high school basketball and football games. Parents and friends, some
equipped with binoculars, keep a lookout for their loved ones as they
make their way down the 1,500-meter racing area at Marine Stadium in
Long Beach. Gracefully, powerfully, the rowers pass them, forming
neat lines that cut through the water with hypnotic precision and
movement.</TE>
<TE>   In many sports, the idea is to work as a team, but rowing's draw
might be that it challenges a team to work in unison, as if one
person were handling the shell.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't work as one, you're not going to go anywhere," Megan
said. "It's the ultimate goal to get that feeling of one."</TE>
<TE>   For Tiffany Webber, 17, who played basketball and ran track before
she discovered rowing, it's the only sport where no one individual
shines brighter than the rest.</TE>
<TE>   "In basketball, you always have your star player," Tiffany said.
"In rowing, there is no star. There might be a stronger person, but
looking from the outside you can never tell."</TE>

<HD>Markham Salsbury, 98; Led Flood Control Efforts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Markham E. "Ham" Salsbury, who took a county job he was told
"couldn't last more than two years" but stayed on for 38 supervising
creation of the Los Angeles Basin's $1-billion flood control and
water conservation system, has died. He was 98.</LD>
<LD>   Salsbury, who retired in 1965 as chief engineer of the Los Angeles
County Flood Control District, died March 20 in a Rancho Palos Verdes
retirement community of complications associated with aging.</LD>
<LD>   After graduating from Caltech with a civil engineering degree in
1925, Salsbury joined the Los Angeles County Surveyor's Office. But
two years later, he switched to the Flood Control District for what
he thought would be a brief tenure in a better-paying job.</LD>
<TE>   "In those days when times were hard, young people didn't think in
terms of greater opportunity, job satisfaction and advancing their
careers," he told The Times in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   But he had stepped into the neophyte Flood Control
District--created in 1915 after a disastrous flood and folded into
the Public Works Department in the mid-1980s--at a propitious time.
Officials were beginning to consider comprehensive basinwide planning
and engineering to solve a large-scale problem, rather than get by on
stopgap city-by-city measures.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no such thing as a long-range plan for flood control or
water conservation. We were operating on a 2- or 3-cent property tax
levy then and the Board of Supervisors frankly wasn't too aware of
our need in 1927," he said.</TE>
<TE>   More county funds, or a bond issue, came the department's way only
after a wet winter washed away homes and perhaps drowned a few
people, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But from 1927 to 1965, with Salsbury as assistant chief engineer
or chief engineer, the district worked with the basin's many cities
and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to spend $1 billion constructing
14 dams, 55 debris basins and 263 miles of permanent concrete
channeling and additional storm drains. In those years, the district
staff grew from 200 to 1,200.</TE>
<TE>   Millions of Gallons of Water Conserved</TE>
<TE>   Salsbury played a key role in the conception and construction of
the system, former county spokesman Stan Steenbock said. He said the
project conserved millions of gallons of water annually, added
coastline barriers to prevent saltwater contamination of fresh water
and curbed flooding.</TE>
<TE>   When he left office, Salsbury estimated the project was 75%
complete.</TE>
<TE>   The massive effort largely changed the basin from an agricultural
area to one of highly urbanized communities, enabling increases in
construction of housing and commercial facilities to accommodate
increasing numbers of people.</TE>
<TE>   As head of the largest local agency of its kind, Salsbury was in
demand as a speaker at national water resources conferences of the
American Society of Civil Engineers and other groups.</TE>
<TE>   He dealt with issues particular to his era--such as testifying
before the Board of Supervisors on which storm drains could be used
as fallout shelters in case an atomic bomb was dropped on Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But he also dealt with ongoing issues including burgeoning growth.
Part of the problem, he said in 1965 with implications still
pertinent today, "is that people insist on living in places they
shouldn't."</TE>
<TE>   After retiring from his flood control position, Salsbury served as
chairman of the Watershed Fire Council of Southern California,
working for funds to reduce fire danger in the area's four national
forests--Cleveland, San Bernardino, Angeles and Los Padres.</TE>
<TE>   Information about any survivors was unavailable.</TE>
<TE>   Steenbock said memorial donations could be sent to the Caltech
YMCA, in care of Molly Hood, Mail Code 158-86, Pasadena, CA 91125.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 28-year-old Willows man died Sunday afternoon from what appeared to
be rabies, according to a Glenn County health official.</LD>
<LD>   If the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirms rabies
was the cause, the death would be the third time that a Californian
has contracted rabies and died in the last seven years, said Dennis
Galvon, medical health officer for Glenn County.</LD>
<LD>   Galvon said the man was taken off life support at Enloe Medical
Center about 2:40 p.m. Earlier tests left doctors and public health
officials 90% sure rabies caused his death, Galvon said.</LD>
<TE>   The man probably contracted the disease from contact with bats in
his home but failed to come in early enough for treatment, Galvon
said.</TE>

<LD>   Windsor police and the Sheriff's Department evacuated Royal Manor
Court Trailer Park shortly after a midmorning call from Carl Donohue,
who said he had shot and killed his 18-year-old grandson, Jesse, Lt.
Matt McCaffrey said.</LD>
<LD>   Police had spent more than five hours outside the trailer when
they heard a gunshot and saw smoke coming from the home. Firefighters
contained the fire shortly afterward but did not say what caused the
fire.</LD>
<TE>   When police entered the trailer about 4 p.m., they found the
bodies of both men, McCaffrey said. It appeared both had been shot to
death.</TE>

<HD>Traditional Allies Clash Over Parks</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Civil liberties advocates and black leaders disagree
on how reform was handled by the police chief, who is fighting to
keep his job.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The standoff between Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn and Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks is causing an unusual rift between traditional
allies: civil libertarians and black political and religious leaders.</LD>
<LD>   The split is the more striking because both sides ascribe to the
same cause: police reform.</LD>
<LD>   Yet some of Los Angeles' most prominent civil liberties advocates
and black leaders with whom they have long stood side-by-side have
come to vastly different conclusions about how the Los Angeles Police
Department has progressed under Parks, who faces a key test today as
he makes his case to keep his job before the city's Police
Commission.</LD>
<TE>   On one hand, black community leaders say that Parks has made good
strides in what they deem key areas of reform: officer accountability
and addressing citizen complaints. "There is just no chief who has
done as much," said black City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, a Parks
supporter.</TE>
<TE>   On the other, some civil libertarians insist that Parks epitomizes
the LAPD status quo, resisting reform on such measures as civilian
oversight at every turn. "It's like two separate conversations," said
civil rights lawyer Constance Rice, a Parks opponent who is black.</TE>
<TE>   Although some civil liberties advocates have taken a stand against
Parks, others are neutral on his reappointment.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, a 37-year LAPD veteran, is nearing the end of his first
five-year term as chief. He is opposed by Hahn, and faces an uphill
battle for reappointment by the mayoral-appointed Police Commission,
which could reach a decision within days. The issue has touched
racial nerves and split political constituencies.</TE>
<TE>   "We all want the same thing for the city. So it's painful for us
on the progressive side to see the civil rights and African American
leadership at odds over this issue," said Daniel Sokatch, executive
director of the Progressive Jewish Alliance, which is neutral on
Parks' reappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very regrettable," said Los Angeles Urban League President
John W. Mack, a Parks supporter, "that some of our traditional civil
liberties allies are not with us."</TE>
<TE>   Although the split breaks along racial lines to some extent, there
are people of each race on both sides, and they profess a nuanced
range of opinions. But vastly different assessments of reform
progress under Parks have relegated natural brothers-in-arms to
different sides.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the realignment has resulted in what Sokatch
calls "strange bedfellows," as civil liberties advocates line up with
the city police officers union against the chief's reappointment.</TE>
<TE>   African American political leaders, meanwhile, have maintained
their habitual posture in opposition to the union, which they label
reactionary and hostile to black interests.</TE>
<TE>   Some civil liberties advocates such as Erwin Chemerinsky, a
constitutional law professor at USC, have taken strong stands against
the chief. Others, such as Rabbi Gary Greenebaum, a former police
commissioner, have remained silent on Parks, confining their comments
to concern over what they see as the slow progress on reform.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, groups such as the Progressive Jewish Alliance and
the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California have opted
not to take a stand on the reappointment of Parks. But leaders of
both organizations question whether reform under Parks has been
adequate. For the ACLU, it is "a very difficult situation," said
Ramona Ripston, the group's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   Such ambivalent or critical positions contrast sharply with those
held by an array of black clergy and traditionally black civil-rights
groups. Leaders of the Urban League and the local chapter of the
Southern Leadership Conference strongly back the chief on the same
grounds on which his critics oppose him: reform.</TE>
<TE>   On both sides of the divide, advocates question the others'
motives. Civil liberties advocates accuse black supporters of Parks
of acting out of racial solidarity, or out of a sense that Hahn,
whose campaign for mayor they vigorously supported, betrayed them.</TE>
<TE>   Black leaders counter that the civil liberties advocates are so
caught up in esoteric conflicts with the chief that they have lost
touch with those whom reform is supposed to benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides claim a better perspective from which to evaluate the
chief's performance. And on both sides, people seem unnerved by the
split.</TE>
<TE>   It's one thing to battle routine foes, quite another to take up
arms against people "who in any other context I've been allies with,"
said Chemerinsky.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute may expose deeper divisions between urban blacks and
"liberal white groups who feel they know what's best for the black
community ....To be honest, they are not in touch," said Parks
supporter Najee Ali, executive director of Project Islamic HOPE.</TE>
<TE>   For Sokatch, the conflict is simply, "very saddening ... there is
a feeling that this issue has created a rift within the alliance," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Definition of Police Reform Is at Issue</TE>
<TE>   At least part of the disagreement is rooted in how one defines
reform.</TE>
<TE>   Black supporters of the chief tend to focus on Parks' efforts in
the areas of police discipline and the investigation of complaints
about day-to-day police misconduct--changes they consider key to
ensuring better treatment of blacks.</TE>
<TE>   They talk frequently about police discourtesy and brutality,
relatively little about preventing the more venal, Rampart-style
police corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Civil liberties advocates tend to focus on issues of civilian
oversight, and especially the chief's troubled relationship with the
Police Commission's inspector general, the civilian watchdog charged
with auditing internal investigations.</TE>
<TE>   They tend to talk frequently about corruption, protection of
whistle-blowers and access to documents, and relatively little about
how the police treat people on the street on a daily basis.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an honest disagreement between some of the people who
have been involved in the civil-rights struggle," said Rabbi Harvey
J. Fields of Wilshire Boulevard Temple, a Parks supporter.</TE>
<TE>   The reason the split is so troubling to many partisans is that for
so long, the notion of reforming the LAPD has been understood to
mean, in part, improving its relationship with the city's
minorities--especially with African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to the LAPD, black residents of South-Central Los
Angeles have been what the Rev. Jesse Jackson calls "the afflicted
community"--disproportionately affected by crime, and more likely to
complain of humiliating encounters with police.</TE>
<TE>   Parks Toughened Discipline System</TE>
<TE>   One of the most conspicuous changes under Parks is toughening the
department's discipline system, which some African American leaders
perceive as going to the heart of the problem they care about most.</TE>
<TE>   Through a combination of stiffer penalties, higher standards and
vastly increased efforts to take, track and investigate citizen
complaints, Parks is thought to have achieved some measure of
behavior modification of LAPD officers on a broad scale. Whether the
modification has made police officers less proactive or made them
behave better toward the public is a matter of debate within the
department.</TE>
<TE>   But to black advocates such as Mack of the Urban League, such
changes are "the real deal. That is what impacts real human beings
out on the streets," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ali, of Project Islamic HOPE and a former gang member, cites the
difference through personal experience.</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, he recalls, an LAPD officer "grabbed me and pushed me
against a car and handcuffed me, made me sit on the curb," he said.
"I felt violated. I was helpless."</TE>
<TE>   After being forced to sit in the hot sun and have his clothes
ruined from perspiration, he was allowed to leave.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Ali said, he was stopped because he resembled a
suspect, but the officers were "courteous, polite. They said 'sir.'
After they ran my license, they talked to me. They said I wasn't the
person they were looking for. They let me go. They apologized."</TE>
<TE>   But Parks draws a sharply different response from civil rights
advocates who regard civilian control as paramount.</TE>
<TE>   His troubled relationship with the commission and its inspector
general dates to the beginning of his term as chief. He has disagreed
with the inspector general on issues including access to internal
affairs documents, protecting the identity of whistle-blowers and the
initiation of audits.</TE>
<TE>   Strong Disagreement With Civilian Overseers</TE>
<TE>   He has also exercised his authority aggressively under the theory
that a chief should be ultimately accountable for the department's
performance.</TE>
<TE>   For the same reason, he has worked to concentrate authority in his
own hands. And he has seen fit to disagree strongly with civilian
overseers when he deems them in error.</TE>
<TE>   The mere appearance that a chief is less than compliant, flexible
and eagerly responsive to civilian bosses is troubling to civil
liberties advocates.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, his stance on civilian oversight suggests little
progress will be made on such far-reaching reform proposals as
improving internal affairs investigations, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't believe a chief should say civilians are not in
control," said Rice, the civil rights lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Complaints and discipline are "surface, skin-level reforms," she
holds. "I take a more complicated look at things."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Norman Johnson, executive director of the Los Angeles
chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, had a quick
retort. Civil liberties advocates can talk about "systems," he
argued, but what matters is how people are treated. "The lived
experience always counts more," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet on both sides, the split with old allies rattles.</TE>
<TE>   Mulling this, Johnson is moved to doubt: "Maybe the civil
libertarians have more insider information," he reflected.</TE>
<TE>   Greenebaum, who questions the pace of reform, echoes that thought.
"Maybe," he said, "[We] are missing something."</TE>

<HD>Jess Stearn, 87; Wrote on the Occult, Reincarnation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jess Stearn, best-selling author of about 30 books on the occult,
including biographies of reincarnation advocate Edgar Cayce, has
died. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Stearn died Wednesday of congestive heart failure at his home in
Malibu.</LD>
<LD>   Stearn's best-known books include "The Sleeping Prophet: The Life
and Work of Edgar Cayce" (1968) and "A Prophet in His Own Country:
The Story of the Young Edgar Cayce" (1974), which a Times book
reviewer rated "a real writing achievement."</LD>
<TE>   In the first, more comprehensive book, Stearn described Cayce as
"a semi-literate health evangelist who boasted miraculous curative
and prophetic powers." The book, a bestseller, earned grudging praise
from critics for what one termed its "first-rate and difficult job of
conveying the character of a very complicated man."</TE>
<TE>   Cayce, poor and uneducated, became known as a clairvoyant who,
while under a hypnotic trance, could diagnose physical ailments and
prescribe cures, predict the future and discuss a subject's past and
future lives. In 1931, he founded the Assn. for Research and
Enlightenment, focusing on reincarnation, with a dozen members. Still
in existence, the organization, headquartered in Virginia Beach, Va.,
now has more than 80,000 members.</TE>
<TE>   "Death is just a comma in the book of life," Stearn told a
conference of the group in Anaheim in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Stearn, educated at Syracuse University, was an unlikely
believer--beginning his career with 17 years as a reporter for the
New York Daily News, followed by a stint as an associate editor at
Newsweek.</TE>
<TE>   But he began to accept Cayce's theories of serial lives and other
aspects of the occult while researching the 1968 biography of the
clairvoyant who earned his living as a photographer.</TE>
<TE>   "Most mystics are simple, uneducated people," Stearn told The
Times in 1971. "Edgar Cayce dropped out of the fifth grade when he
was 16 years old. He wasn't an intelligent man, but he had the gift
to prescribe medical cures and predict the future while in a trance.
He lived poor and he died poor. He felt if his powers were used for
personal gain, it would destroy him."</TE>
<TE>   Stearn wrote another popular occult book based on the true story
of a Canadian girl who assumed the personality of Susan Granier, a
pioneer settler who lived in Ontario during the 19th century. It is
titled "The Search for the Girl With the Blue Eyes."</TE>
<TE>   The author also had a long association with novelist Taylor
Caldwell and wrote "The Search for a Soul: Taylor Caldwell's Psychic
Lives" (1973). Four years later, Stearn collaborated with Caldwell on
the book "I, Judas," telling the story of Jesus' betrayal from the
point of view of the betrayer, Judas.</TE>
<TE>   Among Stearn's other books on the occult are "The Door to the
Future," "Yoga, Youth and Reincarnation," "The Seekers," "Adventures
Into the Psychic," "The Miracle Workers: America's Psychic
Consultants" and "A Matter of Immortality: Dramatic Evidence of
Survival."</TE>
<TE>   He also wrote books of reportage, including his first, "Sisters of
the Night: The Startling Story of Prostitution in New York Today"
(1956), and "The Sixth Man" (1961), which a Times reviewer described
as "a well-written and well-organized exposition on male
homosexuality."</TE>
<TE>   Stearn is survived by a daughter, Dr. Martha Stearn; a son, Fred;
a sister, Enid Sterling; and one grandson.</TE>
<TE>   No funeral services are planned for the author, who became
convinced that he had lived previously and will live again.</TE>

<HD>Amid Pain and Loss, a Blank Spot</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: Brain-injured survivor makes strong recovery but
still can't recall Isla Vista crash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The polite, accommodating man at the center of one of the grimmer
tragedies to strike a California college community in recent years is
the one man who can't recall it.</LD>
<LD>   And maybe that's the only mercy to emerge from the horror of Feb.
23, 2001, when a careening car ran down five people in the Isla Vista
neighborhood adjacent to UC Santa Barbara.</LD>
<LD>   "The last thing I remember before the accident was the weekend
before. I called Ruthie, and we had dinner," said Bert Levy, 28. His
sister, Ruth, died in the tragedy along with his best friend from
high school, Elie Israel.</LD>
<TE>   Levy was sitting in his father's high-rise apartment, overlooking
San Francisco's busy financial district. Trim and clear-eyed, he
looked like any other young man on the go in this energetic
metropolis.</TE>
<TE>   But when he rolled up his blue jeans, he revealed a patchwork of
ugly scars resembling Martian canals. The deepest scar, however, is
one that can't be seen. The brain injury he suffered in the accident
not only stole a chunk of his memory but required him to go through
months of therapy to learn how to walk and talk again.</TE>
<TE>   His next memory after the dinner with his sister is waking up in a
hospital and facing a nurse asking whether he knew where he was. He
guessed a bookstore. "For a long time, I thought I was on an island,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   But if Levy can't remember it, Santa Barbara--a tourist-centric
town on the placid Central Coast--recalls the tragedy all too well.
Thousands of people rallied and held candlelight vigils afterward to
commemorate the victims and demand tighter rein on Isla Vista's
legendary party-hearty weekend bacchanals.</TE>
<TE>   Brighter street lights have been installed, and the county's grand
jury recently urged law enforcement to open a drunk tank in the
crowded student ghetto. Now, the civic wounds are about to bleed once
more as the trial of the driver of the car opens next week.</TE>
<TE>   On its face, the trial of David Attias, a slight, spiky-haired UC
Santa Barbara film studies student, should be straightforward. There
seems little question who was at the wheel that night. Many people
say they saw Attias emerge from his Saab and bound maniacally from
body to body, shouting, "I am the angel of death," and "Ride or die."
"Angel of Death" is the name of a song by the apocalyptic metal band
Slayer, while "Ride or Die" is the name of a Tupac Shakur rap album.</TE>
<TE>   Because Attias has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, the
central issue is whether he should be held criminally responsible for
what happened that night. He faces four counts of murder, as well as
four counts of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated.
Besides Ruth Levy, 20, and Israel, 27, Attias is accused of killing
UC Santa Barbara students Nicholas Bourdakis, 20, and Christopher
Divis, 20.</TE>
<TE>   Bourdakis and Divis were strolling in the street with the other
three, apparently heading for one of the many parties that in the
words of one victim's mother turn Isla Vista into a "den of sex,
drugs and rock 'n' roll" on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Earley, Attias' attorney, denies that his client
intentionally ran anyone down. "He drove by some big parties; he
could have killed 50 people if he was trying," the lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Earley said the young man was so troubled by a long history of
psychological problems that he should not be thrown in prison but be
placed in a mental institution "where he can get treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Court records and interviews portray Attias as being in emotional
trouble from an early age. Mental health therapy was part of the
curriculum in the middle school he attended. The fact that he had
been on medication was revealed in a letter from his father seized by
authorities. Daniel Attias, a Hollywood film and television director,
reportedly wrote of his concern that David had stopped taking his
medication, yet was continuing to drive.</TE>
<TE>   Suspect and His Father Had Tense Relationship</TE>
<TE>   Tensions between father and son escalated to the point that just
before the accident, David reportedly ranted to a dorm mate, Michera
Colella, that his father was threatening to take away his car unless
he started seeing a psychiatrist.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are you telling me this?" Colella was thinking, she said in
an interview with The Times several months ago.</TE>
<TE>   The defendant's nickname in the Francisco Torres dorm was Crazy
Dave, according to friends, because of such bizarre, aggressive
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Viewing a videotape of the accident's aftermath, when David could
be seen fighting with bystanders, a friend said that was typical
David.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than talk things out or walk away, he would come out
swinging," Richard Ramsey told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   All this points to a deeply disturbed person, but will it be
enough to convince a jury that he was insane at the time of the
accident? As in Texas, where Andrea Yates was recently sentenced to
life in prison for drowning her five children despite suffering from
severe mental illness, just being sick isn't enough to prove insanity
in California.</TE>
<TE>   Earley said he must prove either that Attias did not know the
difference between right and wrong or that, because of the severity
of his illness, he was unable to control himself.</TE>
<TE>   One thing that could make the defendant less sympathetic:
allegations of drug involvement. A prosecution document says Attias
"was known to sell drugs from his dorm room and openly trafficked in
the sale of marijuana."</TE>
<TE>   Earley said it would not be fair to call Attias a drug dealer. "I
don't think that's an accurate description of what was going on in
the dorm," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Attias' apparent celebration at the scene of the carnage,
Earley said the young man is "horribly remorseful."</TE>
<TE>   Focused on Recovering From His Injuries</TE>
<TE>   To Bert Levy all these legal details seem like the sound of
distant cannon fire. Something important is happening, but far away.
He hasn't been asked to testify. What could he offer? The tragedy is
lost to him.</TE>
<TE>   Enduring the painful surgeries, learning to walk, getting used to
the idea that his sister and his best friend are gone--those are the
things that have occupied his attention. He had attended law school
before the accident, but he is currently taking a course toward a
teaching credential.</TE>
<TE>   "I've now recovered almost completely," he said proudly.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all he has been through, Levy's sense of humor is intact.
Referring to the loss of his sense of smell, he said he hated fish
growing up. "Now it doesn't bother me to eat it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, problems remain. His conversation contains spaces where he
appears to be ordering his thoughts. He sometimes has difficulty
finding the right word. "I'm a little slower," he said
matter-of-factly.</TE>
<TE>   But he has persevered. Those who know him best say that even with
these deficits Levy has come a miraculous distance since the events
of Feb. 23, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Waxman, a trauma surgeon at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara,
was on duty the night Levy was taken in. "He was very, very
critically ill, near death," Waxman said.</TE>
<TE>   Levy's legs had been splintered like broken glass. His left wrist
was broken. Several bones in his head were broken. He was in a deep
coma, with his brain swelling dangerously.</TE>
<TE>   He found out later just how close to death he came. A passerby who
had completed CPR training just the week before leaned over Levy's
broken body at the accident scene right at the moment he stopped
breathing. Performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, the stranger
brought Levy back to life.</TE>
<TE>   If Levy was lucky in that respect, it was a stroke of bad luck
that he was in Isla Vista at all. He and Israel decided on the spur
of the moment to travel from San Francisco to visit Ruth Levy in Isla
Vista. Bert Levy was heading to Thailand to teach English as a second
language and wanted to say goodbye to his younger sister.</TE>
<TE>   "Theoretically, neither of them should have been there," said Abby
Pollak, Elie's mother, an Oakland-based writer.</TE>
<TE>   Pollak has been understandably traumatized.</TE>
<TE>   "I miss him from the moment I open my eyes in the morning," she
said, sitting at the kitchen table in her house at the foot of the
Oakland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Attias' parents, Daniel and Diane, gave a tearful news conference
on the courthouse steps, expressing their remorse, after their son's
first court appearance. "On behalf of my wife," said Daniel, "I'd
like to say how devastated and heartbroken we are for everyone
affected by this horrible event."</TE>
<TE>   They have since declined to speak publicly, but others have spoken
for them. A baby-sitter, Gina Longo, told The Times last year that
the Attiases were not the dysfunctional family of Hollywood lore.
They tried hard with David, she said, but he was always jittery and
difficult. "They walked on eggshells," she said. "They had more than
they could handle."</TE>
<TE>   When asked how he feels about David Attias, Bert Levy shifted in
his seat, nonplused. "I don't think about him too much," he finally
said.</TE>
<TE>   "My main thought is we should try to make sure our society is
safer," he said. "The last time I was in Isla Vista, I saw people
speeding. That ticked me off."</TE>

<HD>Memorial to Honor State's Fallen Firefighters</HD>
<DH>Monument: Names of 855 who have perished since 1850 will be
on the centerpiece. Statues will be unveiled Saturday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON ORTIZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- When the tree fell on firefighter Kenny Enslow near
Redlands, it split his helmet into four pieces. He died four days
later, the eighth of 12 California firefighters killed in the line of
duty in 1990.</LD>
<LD>   "That was a long time ago," said Redlands Fire Chief Mel Enslow,
Kenny's father. "Now, it's almost like he's with us again."</LD>
<LD>   That is because the fallen Enslow's face is cast in bronze for a
statue that is part of the California Firefighters' Memorial to be
unveiled Saturday a few hundred feet from the steps of the Capitol.</LD>
<TE>   Southern California artist Lawrence Noble used a photograph of
Enslow as a model for "Holding the Line," a 14-foot-high 1,800-pound
statue depicting three firefighters feeding a fire hose to a fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "Holding the Line" is one of three elements in the new Capitol
Park memorial. A beige limestone Memorial Wall is the centerpiece,
bearing the chiseled names of the 855 California firefighters who
have perished in the line of duty since 1850. "Fallen Brother," a
second statue crafted by retired battalion chief and sculptor Jesus
Romo of Sacramento, depicts one firefighter carrying another. It will
stand near the wall and overlook a small stone courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   "We're thrilled that our dream of honoring our fallen brothers and
sisters is finally about to become a reality," said Dan Terry,
president of the California Professional Firefighters and its
nonprofit arm, the California Fire Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Although the timing suggests another tribute to the heroism of
Sept. 11, the memorial is the culmination of a 10-year campaign that
began when Terry saw a national firefighter wall of names in Colorado
Springs.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing that struck me was how many names from California
were on that wall," Terry said. "The second thing that struck me was
how many people from California would never see it."</TE>
<TE>   According to the California Fire Foundation's research, 169
firefighters statewide succumbed to injury or illness caused by their
jobs from 1990 to 2001, about 14 deaths per year and up from the
average of 5.6 deaths per year since California became a state.</TE>
<TE>   The California Professional Firefighters, which represents 30,000
career firefighters and emergency medical service workers statewide,
took up the idea and began applying its considerable political clout.
The union's PAC is a regular campaign contributor, donating more than
$573,000 in 2000, mostly to Democrats, and another $384,000 last
year, according to the secretary of state's office.</TE>
<TE>   The organization lobbied for the California Firefighters'
Memorial, and in 1992 Gov. Pete Wilson signed Assembly Bill 3198 that
gave the project space--and not much else--in Capitol Park.</TE>
<TE>   "We had permission, but no money," Terry said.</TE>
<TE>   A grass-roots movement started in community firehouses as word
about the planned memorial spread. "Locals did car shows, golf
tourneys, whatever they had to do to raise money," Terry said.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation's goal was to erect and maintain the $2-million
project strictly through private donations. Crucial to the plan was
convincing the Legislature to allow the Department of Motor Vehicles
to issue special firefighter license plates with proceeds going to
the memorial. Since 1993, 16,000 plates have been sold, netting $1.3
million for the project.</TE>
<TE>   Another $900,000 came through a voluntary tax checkoff on the
state income tax form that allows taxpayers to allocate a portion of
anticipated tax refunds to charitable causes, said Carroll Wills,
spokesman for the firefighters group.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers said that planning and constructing a memorial in a
park that already has commemoratives to war veterans and police
officers went smoothly, largely because they invited suggestions from
everyone with a stake in the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "We did a study to guarantee that our memorial wouldn't be more
than half the size of the adjacent war memorial," Wills said. "We
talked to anyone who would talk to us, and we listened."</TE>
<TE>   Wills said that ongoing dialogue and sensitivity to integrating
the memorial into the existing park helped the project proceed
smoothly and on budget.</TE>
<TE>   "It's rare for a project to go this smoothly," Wills said.</TE>
<TE>   Just ask New York. There, fire officials changed plans to erect a
memorial based on the now-famous photo of three white firefighters
raising an American flag over the rubble of the Twin Towers. The
statue planned for outside the Brooklyn Fire Department headquarters
drew severe criticism after fire officials announced a change to
depict the group as racially and ethnically diverse.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers of the California memorial said they had no such
trouble. "Our memorial reflects 150 years of firefighting history,
not just one event," said Terry McHale, executive director of the
California Fire Foundation. "California has a diverse work force, and
the statues in the memorial reflect that."</TE>
<TE>   Planners selected models from various backgrounds. "Hold the Line"
features L.A. Fire Capts. Steve Bowie, an African American, and Frank
Reynoso, a Latino, and city of Davis' Rose Conroy, the first woman
fire chief of a professional municipal fire department in California.
"Fallen Brother" creator Romo is also Latino.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis is scheduled to speak at the weekend's unveiling,
and organizers anticipate 3,000 to 5,000 firefighters and family
members will attend the first of what will be a regular vigil.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Battalion Chief Jim Inriquez said he plans to
attend the ceremony as part of a contingent that will include Chief
P. Michael Freeman and seven members of the department's honor guard.</TE>
<TE>   "Many, many of our firefighters have lost their lives over the
years," said Inriquez, an 18-year veteran. "But even if we don't know
a firefighter personally, there's a bond between us. Just look at
Sept. 11. Look at how many firefighters took their own time and paid
their own way to go to New York and help our brothers and sisters. I
think the unveiling ... will emphasize that bond."</TE>
<TE>   Mel Enslow has fought fires and seen death in Southern California
since 1963. He said that he has visited the Capitol Park site and
recognized more than just his son's name on the Memorial Wall.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not the only family to have this void. One of the last
names on the wall, David McLees, was my battalion chief. He died just
last year," Enslow said. "It isn't just about my son. It's about all
those names and all those families. This is sacred ground."</TE>

<HD>Keepers Ask: To Bee or Not to Bee?</HD>
<DH>Farming: State is nation's top honey producer, but many
smaller operations are struggling to survive.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's the buzz on California's honey industry: Beekeepers managed to
pump out enough nectar last year to reestablish the Golden State as
the nation's top honey producer.</LD>
<LD>   But at Red Bennett's honeybee farm north of Moorpark, there has
been little comfort in recapturing the crown.</LD>
<LD>   While honey prices are higher than they've been in years, his
industry faces a swarm of troubles, from cutthroat competition by
foreign exporters to voracious pests that can gut production and
drive beekeepers out of business.</LD>
<TE>   Then there are the more immediate concerns, such as an ongoing dry
spell sure to shrink the amount of vegetation available this year for
his honeybees to feed.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of Agriculture might count California as No.
1, but the veteran beekeeper knows as well as anyone that the view
from the top can be precarious.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't paint too rosy a picture, because it's not," said
Bennett, a 60-year-old former NASA engineer, who two dozen years ago
gave up his interest in space flight for a flight of fancy closer to
earth.</TE>
<TE>   "Beekeeping is pretty tough, and it has become quite difficult to
stay in business," he said. "And right now, it's looking pretty
bleak."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, it was a different picture.</TE>
<TE>   Although production was the lowest in years, California beekeepers
still reaped 28 million pounds of the golden nectar in 2001,
accounting for one-seventh of the nation's production and edging out
longtime rival North Dakota for the top spot.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a decade, the two states--along with South Dakota
and Florida--have been locked in a nip-and-tuck battle for
honey-making preeminence.</TE>
<TE>   But California has emerged as the top producer in seven of the
last nine years, driven largely by good weather and a bountiful
supply of sources available for bees to produce honey.</TE>
<TE>   From the fragrant fruit orchards of the San Joaquin Valley to the
just-blossoming orange groves around Ventura, nearly half a million
colonies are busy each year serving up the sweet syrup--a crop valued
at $18.5 million in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The bees also play a vital role in California agriculture, brought
in by growers to pollinate everything from almonds to summer squash
in an effort to boost yields and quality.</TE>
<TE>   But like farming as a whole, it's an industry confronted by
challenges and coping with change.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps as few as 350 beekeepers statewide now take part in the
profession. That represents about a 25% reduction over the last
decade, as smaller producers have been shooed away by pestilence,
plummeting prices and other problems.</TE>
<TE>   The same holds true nationally.</TE>
<TE>   Domestic honey production nationwide has decreased 20% over the
last decade.</TE>
<TE>   And despite a recent run of higher prices, spurred in part by a
recent decision to levy tariffs against foreign exporters, many U.S.
producers still find themselves struggling just to break even.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gone through some tough stretches," said Lyle Johnston, a
third-generation Colorado beekeeper and president of the 900-member
American Honey Producers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "Beekeeping has changed so much in the last 20 years, and the
industry has really shrunken," he said. "I think all you'll find
anymore are the die-hards working at it."</TE>
<TE>   That appears to be the case in California.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Mussen, a honeybee expert at UC Davis, said not only are
there fewer honey producers today than there were 10 years ago, but
many of those who remain are veterans of the trade, rugged
individualists unburdened by such conventions as time clocks or
production schedules.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble is, there aren't a lot of younger beekeepers waiting to
take their place, no new generation ready--or willing--to take up
traditions that date back thousands of years.</TE>
<TE>   Add to that a trend toward consolidation, with larger operations
cornering a growing share of the honey market, and the result is an
industry barreling toward uncertainty.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say it's tenuously holding its own at the moment," said
Mussen, who works with beekeepers across the state through the
University of California's cooperative extension program.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's not too different from what you see in farming overall,"
he said. "I think there are a lot of [beekeepers] who would be more
than happy to turn the reins over to somebody else. The question
becomes, who--if anybody--is going to take over?"</TE>
<TE>   In California's honeybee heartland, Tulare County beekeeper Max
Eggman learned the trade as a child. His father and older brother
worked with bees. And Eggman joined the profession when he left the
Marines in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   Now, at 72, he's carved a profitable niche in the honey market,
competing with larger producers by selling at roadside stands and San
Francisco farmers markets.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he knows his industry is in decline. Managing 600 to 700
hives, he said it has become harder to compete with larger
operations, which truck hives by the thousands to places where nectar
is in great supply.</TE>
<TE>   And there's not a lot money to be made, especially for newcomers
who would probably need to go into debt to get off the ground.</TE>
<TE>   None of Eggman's own children chose to follow in his footsteps.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a dwindling industry, no question," said Eggman, who is
among a band of beekeepers operating out of California's top
honey-producing county. "I don't see it being a dead end. I just
think it will be harder and harder to be prosperous."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County was once home to a thriving industry, one that
appeared before citrus hit its heyday and when bees were more
profitable than cattle. There were enough beekeepers just two decades
ago to support a countywide association of honey producers.</TE>
<TE>   But the group disbanded about 10 years ago, and now fewer than a
dozen commercial producers remain. Even so, they've been a busy
bunch.</TE>
<TE>   Both honey production and the value of the crop more than tripled
from 1999 to 2000, according to Ventura County's crop report. Local
beekeepers also increased the amount of money generated from renting
hives to growers for pollination.</TE>
<TE>   For producers such as Ojai Valley beekeeper Brian Cox, it's that
rental business that keeps his operation afloat.</TE>
<TE>   The 46-year-old honey maker moved to Ojai in 1993 with 300 hives
and a direct-marketing approach to pushing his products--honey, skin
cream and lip balm--at farmers markets locally and in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But he also started searching out farmers whose crops could
benefit from the pollination his bees could provide, a service that
has become more valuable as pests and other problems have decimated
feral bee populations.</TE>
<TE>   Like honey producers nationwide, Cox recently retrieved his bees
from the San Joaquin Valley, where farmers pay good money to have
them pollinate that region's almond crop.</TE>
<TE>   They already are booked to provide the same service for Ventura
County avocado growers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the biggest deal for beekeepers; it's basically what has
kept beekeeping alive," Cox said of the hive rentals, which
supplement honey production of about 30,000 pounds a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Agriculture is really tough," he said. "Prices have been
depressed, and there's a lot of competition from other countries.
American agriculture just has to find ways to be better."</TE>
<TE>   That's what Red Bennett has been about for more than two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing that he could not survive solely on his own production, he
set out to carve a niche in the industry, processing and distributing
honey for beekeepers locally and out of state.</TE>
<TE>   Working out of a mothballed egg ranch near Moorpark--where he and
his wife, Ann, set up shop after fire destroyed their Piru Canyon
honeybee farm in 2000--his operation produces about 200 tons a year.</TE>
<TE>   The Bennetts are headed into their busiest season, as springtime
signals the arrival of millions of bees from around the country
brought to Ventura County to flit among the avocados and
ever-fragrant orange blossoms.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to diversify the business in order to stay in business,"
said Bennett, who has seen plenty of other honey producers go under,
unable to sustain themselves on prices as low a few years ago as they
were when he first got into the business.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if you get a good crop," he said, "you're not guaranteed to
make any money."</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say he has stopped trying.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of three full-time employees, Bennett was busy last
month processing the last of his winter product--a honey drawn from
eucalyptus.</TE>
<TE>   Pulling one honey-drenched frame after another from stacks of
empty beehives, the workers inserted them into a machine that shaves
off the wax and then into a contraption that tumbles like a laundry
dryer until all the nectar is drawn out.</TE>
<TE>   The shavings become beeswax cakes sold to candle makers and other
users, while the honey is funneled into 55-gallon drums until it is
ready for bottling.</TE>
<TE>   Now that it is spring, Bennett will turn his attention to an
orange honey produced in vast quantities this time of year. And
afterward--if the lack of rain hasn't completely worked against
him--maybe he'll manage to squeeze some nectar from the sage that
should start flowering on the Ventura County hillsides next month.</TE>
<TE>   "We do whatever we can to keep the bees alive and healthy, and
going into the next season," he said. "Something that works one year
won't work the next, so you're always questioning your bee sense. But
we're going to keep working at it, because I decided a long time ago
I was done working in an office."</TE>

<HD>Attack Hits Place Where Jews and Arabs Mixed</HD>

<DL>HAIFA, Israel
</DL>
<LD>There wasn't any guard outside Matza's restaurant Sunday when
dozens of diners piled in for an afternoon meal. Matza's is run by an
Israeli Arab, so no one ever thought it would be targeted for a terrorist
attack.</LD>
<LD>   "I am an Arab, and I should get a guard?" Ali Adawi, 57, said to his
Jewish friend Yakov Nachmani, dismissing the suggestion as absurd.</LD>
<LD>   But the ordinary and the unthinkable have switched places in Israel
these days. Adawi was cooking meat and potatoes on a grill in the
kitchen, listening to the laughter filling the dining room, when a man
walked into Matza's and blew himself up. The explosion tore through the
roof, shattered windows and chairs, blasted patrons with shrapnel and
killed at least 15 people besides the bomber while wounding as many as
41.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses said the restaurant appeared to fly into the air.</TE>
<TE>   Adawi crashed to the floor, the meat and potatoes toppling over him.
The explosion destroyed the restaurant and obliterated one tiny corner of
this troubled land where Arabs and Israelis had found some common ground,
by themselves, without the help of government mediators. They did it by
getting to know one another, sitting together, drinking coffee, sharing
meals.</TE>
<TE>   Now their small sanctuary was gone, and many were dead--Jews and
Arabs, men, women and children.</TE>
<TE>   "I am looking forward to the day when Jews and Arabs will live next to
each other in peace and love," Adawi said later from a hospital bed as
two of his Jewish friends stood by his side. "That is what I want."</TE>
<TE>   That dream was as far away Sunday as it has ever been. This country of
6 million people lived through another day of terror attacks--one in this
picturesque port city on the Mediterranean, another in the Efrat
settlement in the West Bank, which killed the bomber and left four medics
wounded. With each blast, each civilian casualty, Israelis came closer to
full acceptance that, once again, their nation was at war. Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon didn't need to say the words.</TE>
<TE>   People here feel it.</TE>
<TE>   "The political arguments don't any longer exist," said Effi Batzia,
38, a financial manager and self-described liberal who was called up for
military service Sunday. "We don't see any ot1751478816happy to go to
war, to settle things with force. We are not. I now believe it is the
only thing left to do."</TE>
<TE>   All over Israel on Sunday, men and women stepped out of their private
lives, left families and jobs, and answered the call to report for active
military duty. The call-up of 20,000 reservists is the largest in the
Jewish state since 1982, when the IDF--the Israel Defense Forces--invaded
Lebanon. But that invasion ultimately proved unpopular. It was viewed as
a war of choice, not necessity.</TE>
<TE>   The circumstances this time are different. One social scientist said
recent events had quieted the peace community and silenced a growing
chorus of conscientious objectors, hundreds of soldiers who had refused
to serve in the Palestinian territories. Israelis, it seems, are now
caught in the same psychological force field that Palestinians have
pointed to as the motivation for their attacks: They feel desperate, with
no choice but to lash out.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a real war now, and in a time of war, we have never experienced
people saying they did not want to take part," said Tamar Hermann,
managing director of the Tami Steinmetz Center for Peace Research in Tel
Aviv. "It is as if all the rules of the game have been broken. It is a
real war, though not a conventional war."</TE>
<TE>   Israel's large-scale military call-up is an indication that it is
planning an intense and sustained operation in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Infantry brigades, tank units and support forces are all headed
for the Palestinian territories.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the reservists, from all walks of life, parked their cars in a
dirt field at the edge of Pisgat Zeev, a Jewish neighborhood adjacent to
Jerusalem on land occupied by Israel in 1967. They put on their uniforms,
slung automatic weapons over their shoulders and climbed into buses for
the ride to their camps.</TE>
<TE>   "First of all, we are going to defend our homeland," said Mordechai
Pereta, 47, who as a father of seven is exempt from service but
nevertheless volunteered. "I completely support this. Anyone who thinks
it will get better by itself is dreaming."</TE>
<TE>   Elazar Zur, 30, left his job as a truck driver to take up arms against
the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't do this now, it will only get worse. At least we can
dismantle the terror infrastructure and it will get better," Zur said.</TE>
<TE>   For months, Israel has waged military operations against the
Palestinians. The army tightened its grip Sunday on the West Bank city of
Ramallah, declaring the area a closed military zone and sealing off
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat and whoever else was in the
city.</TE>
<TE>   And the bombings continued.</TE>
<TE>   Jerusalem was hit by a suicide bomber Friday. Tel Aviv was hit
Saturday. Haifa was targeted Sunday. Those are Israel's three largest
cities.</TE>
<TE>   Jerusalem's streets and shops were already vacant before the Friday
blast. But residents of Haifa and Tel Aviv were shaken, their remaining
sense of security badly undermined. In Haifa, Mayor Amram Mitzna canceled
a children's festival and cautioned people to stay out of places without
security guards, including elementary schools and kindergartens.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we don't have to wait for threats when it's obvious we are in
the midst of a terror wave, and since the event of the [Passover]
holiday, we have had an attack per day," said Israeli Police Chief Shlomo
Aharonishky.</TE>
<TE>   Matza's restaurant is on Rupin Street, a road that curves up the
towering hills of Haifa. The city feels like San Francisco, where even a
gas station can offer a breathtaking view of the metropolis and the sea
below. Matza's was a broad Quonset-style hut with a metal roof and
plastic signs--but an amazing vista.</TE>
<TE>   The locals loved it, Adawi said. For 16 years, he worked the kitchen,
seated customers and, when time permitted, sat, drank coffee and chatted.
Adawi hails from Touran, a village in the Galilee. No one was more
surprised by how close he grew to the community in Haifa than he was.
Except maybe his customers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is perhaps the only place where there was true friendship," said
Ayal Batsir, 33, a Jewish resident of Haifa who spent hours Sunday trying
to comfort his friend from the restaurant. "It was the perfect
relationship. There was no hypocrisy."</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian militant group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
destruction and deaths atMatza's; the fatalities included one of Adawi's
cousins. A Hamas official in the northern West Bank town of Jenin
identified the attacker as Shadi Zakariya Toubasi, 22, a resident of the
Jenin refugee camp.</TE>
<TE>   Lena Mionis, 23, was working at a gas station not 50 yards away when
the bomb went off. Shrapnel hit her leg. She said she ran to a man at the
gas pump and asked if he would drive her away. But he refused, shoved her
back and drove off. She suspects that he was an accomplice. Police were
looking for a man who might have driven the bomber to his target.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard a huge boom," Mionis said from a bed in the emergency room of
Bnai Zion hospital. "I saw the whole restaurant flying up in the air."</TE>
<TE>   The victims with relatively minor injuries were taken to Bnai Zion.
The serious cases were rushed to the regional trauma facility at the
Rambam Medical Center. Nine patients were brought in, and two died on the
operating table. One was a teenage girl, another an elderly woman.
Hospital spokesman Zvi Ben-Yishai said the medical center had treated
many war casualties from Lebanon but that he had never seen a victim so
completely riddled with shrapnel as were some of the diners from Matza's.</TE>
<TE>   "These were very heavy shrapnel injuries, from head to toe," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the hospital lobby, an all too familiar scene was playing out:
anxious relatives rushing in for word of their loved ones, a young woman
breaking down and sobbing. A woman on a gurney was wheeled in. She knew
that her husband was dead but didn't know where her two children were.
Bodies still needed to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   At the remains of the restaurant, work crews swept up the glass and
cleaned away debris as forensic teams picked through the mess searching
for evidence. A small crowd gathered to watch. One man held a large
Israeli flag.</TE>
<TE>   Someone taped a poster to a fence. It said: "Let the IDF win."</TE>

<HD>'82 Falklands Conflict Left a Legacy of Tragedy, Hope</HD>
<DH>S. America: Argentina's veterans struggle with stigma and poverty
while islanders prosper.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>STANLEY, Falkland Islands
</DL>
<LD>The landing craft came ashore on a beach of white sand and
turquoise water, a solitary spot where Patrick Watts and his friends
chased away the penguins and raced motorcycles in their youth.</LD>
<LD>   On that April morning, it was thousands of Argentine teenagers who
spilled onto the beach. They were chicos from the pampas on the adventure
of their lives, a tragicomic little war that would change Argentina
forever and leave scars that linger, a generation later, on these remote
islands in the South Atlantic.</LD>
<LD>   The beach at Yorke Bay is closed today, as are many beaches, hillsides
and meadows here. The treeless moonscape of the Falklands is dotted with
more than 100 abandoned minefields, each a no man's land since the
Argentines invaded the islands 20 years ago this Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   The scars also run deep in Buenos Aires, where thousands of veterans
live as broken men. Some sell trinkets on buses and trains, hit hard by
their nation's economic hard times. A powerful stigma haunts many of the
13,000 Argentine survivors of the war.</TE>
<TE>   "Here it says I'm a hero," Raul Barrera, 39, said in the Argentine
capital, holding his veteran's identification card, which he sometimes
flashes at skeptical commuters. "But when you go to look for work, they
find out you're a veteran and they think you're mentally ill."</TE>
<TE>   Six out of 10 Argentine veterans are out of work or underemployed,
according to an advocacy group. About 300 have killed themselves,
including one spectacular 1999 case of a war survivor who threw himself
from the top of a 250-foot-tall patriotic monument.</TE>
<TE>   The emotional toll is not confined to the losing side. In Britain, the
number of Falklands veterans who have committed suicide since the
war--264--outnumbers the British deaths in the battle.</TE>
<TE>   In Argentina, the loss of the 1982 war helped usher in the collapse of
a military government and a return to democracy. But today that democracy
is in peril as the unemployment rate soars to 25%. After a Southern
Hemisphere summer of upheaval in which five men rotated through the
presidency, there are wild rumors of a military coup--vehemently denied
by the armed forces.</TE>
<TE>   These troubles make people nervous in the Falklands, which are located
about 250 miles off Argentina's southern coast. Disputed by Britain and
Argentina since the latter's independence nearly two centuries ago, the
Falklands--called the Malvinas by Argentines, the name they also gave to
the war--have been occupied by Britons since 1833.</TE>
<TE>   The war, started by Argentine President Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri in a
desperate attempt to stay in power, cost the lives of 655 Argentines, 252
British soldiers and three civilians.</TE>
<TE>   During the brief Argentine occupation, the same generals who
"disappeared" tens of thousands of their citizens in a "dirty war"
against dissent in the late 1970s and early '80s imposed a less violent,
but still authoritarian, rule on the 2,000 British subjects who live
here.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother never recovered from the war," said Watts, 57, a
third-generation Falklander. "She had her house broken into [by Argentine
troops]. She had jewelry stolen, and she lost all her cattle--either they
were killed by the Argentines or they stepped on mines."</TE>
<TE>   Before the invasion, Watts was courting an Argentine woman. As a young
man he used to travel to Buenos Aires to enjoy the vibrant life of that
city.</TE>
<TE>   His love affair with Argentina ended the morning of April 2, 1982. He
was at the microphone of Falklands Radio, broadcasting news of the
invasion when an Argentine soldier burst into the studio.</TE>
<TE>   Listeners across the islands heard Watts utter these words shortly
before going off the air: "One moment . . . Wait there. No, no, I won't
do anything until you take that gun off my back."</TE>
<TE>   Away from the battlefields, far from the rusting skeletons of downed
helicopters and from the shelters Argentine soldiers built haphazardly
out of rocks, the Falklands are islands of desolate beauty, a terrain
reminiscent of the strange, barren landscapes in which dreams unfold.</TE>
<TE>   "You go out there now and it's so peaceful," said Sheila McPhee, who
owns a sheep farm that faces the beach on San Carlos Bay, where about
5,000 British troops began landing May 21, 1982, to take back the
islands. "On a day like today, it's hard to believe the war ever
happened."</TE>
<TE>   Before the war, Falkland farmers like McPhee were leaving the islands
in droves. A worldwide drop in wool prices had hit farmers hard, leading
many to emigrate to New Zealand and Australia. The British empire had
been divesting itself of colonies for decades and, in the face of
international pressure, was nudging the islanders to accept the
inevitability of Argentine sovereignty.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything in the Falklands has changed since the conflict," said
Terence McPhee, Sheila's husband. "We've never had it so good."</TE>
<TE>   Sheep raising still doesn't make much money, but most of the islands'
residents benefit from the Falklands' lucrative fishing licenses, a
product of increased autonomy from London since the war.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the British government has invested millions in the
islands in the last two decades, building badly needed roads. The
Falklands are now synonymous with British patriotism and any talk of
Argentine sovereignty is a political poison pill in the United Kingdom.
There is a new army base and airstrip on East Falkland island, manned by
a large contingent of British soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Certain corners of the Falklands have the feel of a military operation
in progress, as if the war never ended. Fighter jets routinely fly low
over Stanley harbor. Strands of barbed wire mark tracts of land where
ubiquitous red signs warn: "DANGER, MINES."</TE>
<TE>   The Argentines planted most of the mines. Nearly all are plastic,
making them difficult to detect. When several British soldiers were
injured in mine clearance work in the days after the war, the army
decided to leave about 18,000 mines buried in the sand and soil.</TE>
<TE>   The minefields are only the most menacing legacy of a conflict that
remains seared in the memory of Falklanders. People here have always
retained the outlook and disposition of an isolated British rural
village. For them, the Argentine occupation was an unwanted encounter
with an alien culture.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Peck, a 64-year-old former police officer, remembers being
stunned by the sight of Argentine armored vehicles heading toward
Stanley, the capital. "I felt a numb, cold feeling."</TE>
<TE>   The Argentines imposed a chaotic and arbitrary form of rule. They
tried to force Spanish instruction in the schools. They made people drive
on the right-hand side of the road, which struck Gerald Cheek, a local
aviation official, as absurd.</TE>
<TE>   Cheek was at the wheel of his car with his family one morning in
Stanley when he found himself in a standoff with an Argentine army
truck--they were going in opposite directions, but on the same side of
the road.</TE>
<TE>   "I got very angry. I said, 'I'm in my country! I'm on the left side of
the road and I'm not moving!' "</TE>
<TE>   Later, Cheek was interrogated by an Argentine intelligence officer who
told him menacingly: "You're not behaving yourself."</TE>
<TE>   Military police soon arrived at his home to take him away. "My family
thought I was being disappeared to Argentina," Cheek said. Instead, he
was placed under house arrest in a remote corner of the islands.</TE>
<TE>   Afraid he would be arrested too, Peck set off for the hills. "I felt
safer sleeping under the stars," he said. He became a one-man guerrilla
army, sabotaging air strips and taking notes on Argentine positions. When
British troops landed, he joined them as a guide.</TE>
<TE>   In Stanley, meanwhile, the situation quickly deteriorated. In the
curfew-darkened town, panicky Argentine troops often opened fire on each
other or on wandering dogs and cats.</TE>
<TE>   The war only served to strengthen the Falklanders' sense that they had
a unique cultural identity apart from Argentina, which continues to
assert its claim.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Cheek, a member of the Falklands' Legislative Council and Gerald
Cheek's sister-in-law, is mystified as to why anyone would join the two.
"You look at our way of life here, and what's going on in Argentina, and
you say, 'What's the point?' "</TE>
<TE>   Many residents retain a sense of Argentina as a country in disarray,
an image reinforced by their memories of the final hours of the
occupation--groups of hungry soldiers roaming the streets of Stanley,
begging for food.</TE>
<TE>   Oscar Ismael Poltronieri is a slight, wiry man who was raised on a
farm outside Buenos Aires. He can neither read nor write. But he is one
of the most decorated Argentine heroes of the war.</TE>
<TE>   Poltronieri is one of a handful of men, and the only private, to win
the Cross of the Argentine People for Heroic Combat, the army's highest
battlefield honor. Standing alone on a mountaintop with a machine gun, he
twice held off British soldiers and allowed his comrades to withdraw.</TE>
<TE>   "What's been my reward?" he said, repeating a reporter's question.
"Well, they say I owe $35,000 on the house [the city government] gave
me." Only the down payment was free, and now if he doesn't make the
payments, "they're going to evict me in two months."</TE>
<TE>   Poltronieri recounts his story inside the Buenos Aires offices of the
House of the War Veterans, an anachronism of patriotic fervor, where the
glory of the war is preserved in a photograph that depicts an Argentine
marine taking several British soldiers prisoner.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a sad experience, because we went there to win," said Juan B.
Mendicino, president of the veterans' house. "We gave our lives. And for
what? To let them take something that was ours."</TE>
<TE>   The veterans earn a pension of about $125 a month. Laws passed after
the war grant them priority for government jobs, medical services and
subsidized housing, but are rarely followed.</TE>
<TE>   There is widespread agreement that veterans suffer from high levels of
mental illness and homelessness.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation in which they are living is absolutely humiliating,"
said Maria Alejandra Lopez, a volunteer psychologist at the veterans'
house. "They're stigmatized as being aggressive and dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   "There are some veterans who are still living in a situation of
permanent horror," Lopez said. "And there are many more who feel guilty
for not having won the war. What they feel, above all, is a break with
their innocence."</TE>
<TE>   The overwhelming majority of Argentine soldiers were teenagers, most
of them from towns in impoverished provinces. In 1982, they set off for
the Falklands from an Argentina united behind the war.</TE>
<TE>   But veterans recount stories of wartime privation, of rations that
never arrived. Carlos Nunez, a 39-year-old veteran, recalls the desertion
of two commanding officers.</TE>
<TE>   "When we finally surrendered, I was happy for two reasons," he said.
"First, because we didn't have a jefe. And second, because we didn't have
any food or ammunition."</TE>
<TE>   "The war we made wasn't worth anything," said Poltronieri, unemployed
and a father of four. "If we had won it or lost it we would still be in
the same position. But if I had to go, I would go again. I would go for
all the things I left behind. I left my brothers there. And I would go
back for them."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Argentines' war dead are buried in an austere cemetery
near the Falklands settlement of Darwin. The Argentine and Falklands
governments have bickered about the cemetery, with the islanders denying
requests to build a large memorial at the site.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the two sides reached agreement last month on a more modest
memorial.</TE>
<TE>   In Buenos Aires there are many signs that suggest the war was never
lost. Daily weather reports still list the forecast for Puerto Argentino,
the name Argentina gave to Stanley. April 2 is a national holiday:
Malvinas Day.</TE>
<TE>   Each year veterans march by torchlight at midnight on Malvinas Day to
a memorial in central Buenos Aires. They gather first at the veterans'
house, where a small wooden box holds a precious keepsake: a fistful of
Falklands soil.</TE>

<HD>Bush Silent as Pressure Rises to Act on Mideast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush is under growing pressure to do something--almost
anything--to defuse the intense hostilities between Israel and the
Palestinians, which flared anew Sunday with two more suicide bombings and
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's solemn pronouncement that his
country is in "a war over our home."</LD>
<LD>   Unlike the many world leaders who weighed in on the mounting crisis,
Bush was silent Sunday. His only public appearance was at Easter services
at a Baptist church near his Texas ranch, and aides said he made no calls
to Mideast leaders.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's thoughts were relayed indirectly following the day's suicide
bombings, which killed 17 and injured more than 40. White House spokesman
Gordon Johndroe told reporters that Bush "condemns these acts of
terrorism. The president will not let these latest attacks deter him from
the pursuit of peace."</LD>
<TE>   But as European presidents, Arab princes and religious leaders on
Sunday made their own appeals for peace, current and former U.S.
officials questioned the lack of American action as the region plunged
into deeper conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most poignant words came from an ailing Pope John Paul II,
who denounced the "horror and despair" that have converted the holy lands
into a war zone. Using his annual Easter message to urge international
intervention to end the bloodshed, the pontiff said, "No one can remain
silent and inactive, no political or religious leader."</TE>
<TE>   Many had tough words for the Bush administration. At home, former
National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, who served in the Carter
administration that orchestrated the first Mideast peace accord, between
Israel and Egypt in 1978, said U.S. policy in recent months reflected
"strategic incoherence."</TE>
<TE>   Brzezinski also faulted the Bush administration for responding only to
the "outrage" of terrorism, and not to a simultaneous offer of peace made
at an Arab League summit in Beirut last week.</TE>
<TE>U.S. Should Lay Out 'Concept of Peace'</TE>
<TE>   "Three days ago, we had an outrage, the bombing [of a Passover Seder],
but we had a moment of historic opportunity--the proposal made by the
Arabs, for the first time in 50 years . . . to recognize Israel and to
live with it in peace. The United States has seized on the outrage. It is
not exploiting the opportunity. And that is a major strategic
shortcoming," he said on ABC's "This Week."</TE>
<TE>   Since the Israelis and Palestinians have failed to forge a peace on
their own, the Bush administration should now lay out a "concept of
peace"--the "fair components" for a final settlement--to get the process
back on track, he added.</TE>
<TE>   No progress can be expected without U.S. action, said former Clinton
National Security Advisor Samuel R. "Sandy" Berger, who helped craft an
accord between Israel and Jordan in 1994. All American presidents during
the last three decades have understood that "the very act of American
engagement here is extraordinarily important."</TE>
<TE>   "We have to put some political chips on the table. And every American
president since Nixon has understood this. Vice President [Dick] Cheney
said it very clearly last week: Nothing is going to happen without us. We
have to get engaged in this--not simply in admonishments and
condemnations, but by putting some real effort here," Berger said on
"This Week."</TE>
<TE>   The administration was besieged Sunday with other suggestions from
both Republican and Democratic legislators.</TE>
<TE>   The United States should propose a political settlement "to give some
hope to these 18-year-olds [the suicide bombers] who are really just
posing a threat which can't be stopped," Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) said
on CBS' "Face the Nation."</TE>
<TE>   Specter, who met last week with several Mideast leaders, including
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, said Washington should
also move "aggressively" concerning Arab countries that may be financing
Palestinian extremists.</TE>
<TE>   The White House should initiate "much bolder moves," including
dispatching Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, to take the U.S.
mediation efforts above the level of U.S. special envoy Anthony C. Zinni,
said Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.).</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's time, with all respect to Gen. Zinni, that the president
ask Secretary Powell, who has such great stature throughout the world, to
go to the Middle East," Lieberman said on "Fox News Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman compared the Palestinians' suicide bombings with the actions
of the 19 hijackers who carried out the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I fear that a fanatical group of extremist terrorists has hijacked
the very legitimate goal of Palestinian statehood," said Lieberman, a
member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Democrats' vice
presidential candidate in 2000. "The terrorists that are carrying out
suicide bombings against Israeli civilians are cut from the same cloth as
the 19."</TE>
<TE>'Something Dramatic' Needs to Be Done</TE>
<TE>   The United States should offer a comprehensive peace plan that
embraces all Arab countries, said Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.),
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there needs to be something dramatic done, and that means the
president has to step up his involvement," Biden said on "Face the
Nation."</TE>
<TE>   There is even growing debate about a role for U.S. troops in the event
of a final settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't put American troops against the will of the parties,
because they would become engaged in combat. But I would certainly be
prepared to offer American military presence to monitor and guarantee a
settlement," Brzezinski said.</TE>

<HD>Israel Broadens Offensive as 2 Suicide Attacks Kill 17</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Troops push into more Palestinian towns in the West Bank.
Sharon tightens siege on Arafat. Each vows to fight to the end.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Steadfast enemies for more than two decades, Ariel Sharon and
Yasser Arafat vowed a fight to the finish as fresh carnage Sunday plunged
this region deeper into warfare.</LD>
<LD>   Israel widened its military offensive in the Palestinian territories,
sending ground forces into two more West Bank cities, and Palestinian
suicide bombers launched their fourth and fifth attacks in five days,
killing 17 people and wounding dozens.</LD>
<LD>   One blast devastated a restaurant in the northern Israeli port of
Haifa where Israeli Arabs and Jews mixed freely, killing the attacker and
15 others and injuring as many as 41. In the second incident, in the
Jewish settlement of Efrat in the West Bank, the assailant blew himself
up, wounding four medics.</LD>
<TE>   As Israeli forces tightened their harsh siege on Arafat and Ramallah,
the city that is the Palestinian Authority president's power base, the
Israeli government ordered all journalists to leave the area. Some were
ordered to submit their reports to a military censor.</TE>
<TE>   In a televised address to his despondent nation, Sharon branded Arafat
"an enemy of the entire free world" who must be "uprooted" along with the
terrorism network that the Israeli prime minister insists Arafat directs.</TE>
<TE>   "We must fight against this terrorism, fight with no compromise, pull
up these wild plants by the roots, smash their infrastructure, because
there is no compromise with terrorism," said a grim-faced Sharon, his
brow deeply furrowed.</TE>
<TE>   He told Israelis that they are fighting a war for their existence but
offered no new ideas for resolving the conflict. Instead, he repeated a
simple, blunt justification for Israel's thrust into the West Bank. The
Jewish state, he said, is at war against "terrorism"--a word he used
about 15 times in his four minutes on the air.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat, taking advantage of visiting foreign activists who had sneaked
past Israeli tanks into his compound, announced to the world that he
would never surrender.</TE>
<TE>   "Victory will be here sooner than expected, God willing," Arafat said,
hugging his visitors and mugging for TV cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Israel began laying siege to Ramallah on Friday after a suicide
bombing on the first night of Passover killed 23 people in the Israeli
coastal city of Netanya.</TE>
<TE>   The military incursion was intended as a campaign to eliminate
terrorism, but instead new bombings have followed almost every day.
Israel, ignoring international calls for restraint, apparently planned to
replicate the Ramallah siege in other West Bank towns as part of a
sweeping operation.</TE>
<TE>   Tanks moved into the West Bank town of Kalkilya late Sunday,
electricity was cut and gun battles could be heard, residents said. Tanks
also were entering Bethlehem early today, witnesses said. The army might
have been waiting until Easter was over before invading the largely
Christian area.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said tanks moved to within 500 feet of the Church of the
Nativity, the traditional birthplace of Jesus. Also early today, tanks
roared into the village of Khader, just south of Bethlehem.</TE>
<TE>   In Ramallah on Sunday, Israeli troops rounded up dozens of Palestinian
men and spent a third day conducting intensive house-to-house searches.
Troops occupied homes, businesses and public buildings, including the
Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Tanks and armored troop transports plied the streets, chopping the
pavement, flattening cars that got in the way and toppling light posts
and traffic signs. The air was full of dust and the smell of burning
rubber.</TE>
<TE>Palestinians Trapped in Their Homes</TE>
<TE>   The siege has trapped tens of thousands of Palestinians in their
homes. Few dare emerge into the streets for fear of being shot.</TE>
<TE>   In the kind of scene that was repeated throughout central Ramallah,
Israeli troops were inspecting the faded home of an elderly man Sunday.
In the back garden, about 20 men in civilian clothes could be seen,
seated or squatting on the ground, their hands bound by plastic
handcuffs, with soldiers standing guard. An officer said the men were
fighters who had used the home to hide their weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The goal of the Ramallah operation, Sharon has said, is not to kill
Arafat but to isolate him. To further tighten the noose, Israeli troops
took cars belonging to Palestinian residents and laid them on their
sides, bumper to bumper, across almost every street leading to Arafat's
compound.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, Sharon's government was livid Sunday when a group of
international peace activists, accompanied by journalists, marched past
the tanks surrounding Arafat's headquarters and strolled in to see the
Palestinian leader.</TE>
<TE>   The activists took water and a small amount of food but, most
important, gave Arafat a platform. About 30 of them said they planned to
stay in the compound to serve as a human shield for him. Ten of the
activists, along with three Palestinian ambulance medics, were arrested
later by Israeli soldiers and taken to a nearby base, a member of the
group said.</TE>
<TE>   After Arafat appeared on television, the Israeli army and government
ordered foreign journalists to leave Ramallah or risk being expelled by
force. The army declared the area a closed military zone, a designation
that means off limits but is enforced spottily.</TE>
<TE>U.S. Reporter Shot in the Shoulder</TE>
<TE>   Also Sunday, an American journalist, Anthony Shadid, was shot in the
shoulder a short time after leaving the compound.</TE>
<TE>   Shadid, a Washington-based reporter for the Boston Globe, was walking
away from Arafat's compound and toward a hotel through an area controlled
by Israeli soldiers. Army medics treated him, then summoned a Palestinian
ambulance, which took him to the private Arab Care Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The army said it was investigating the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   When Western reporters went to the hospital to check on Shadid, they
were denied entry by soldiers who had occupied the first floor.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said the troops were searching the hospital rooms while
confining doctors and nurses to certain floors. It was the second time in
two days that the hospital had been raided.</TE>
<TE>   At the larger, state-run Ramallah Hospital, staffers defied the tanks.
When the machines rolled into the emergency driveway, dozens of doctors,
nurses and other medical personnel staged a sit-in, vowing that the
troops would enterthe hospital "over our dead bodies," said cardiologist
Dr. Mohammed Batrawi.</TE>
<TE>   The army eventually compromised with the hospital management, agreeing
to a perimeter check instead of a more thorough search after the hospital
director gave assurances that no armed men were inside.</TE>
<TE>Army Believes Terrorists to Be Hiding in Hospital</TE>
<TE>   There were reports in the evening, however, that the hospital had been
raided.</TE>
<TE>   An army spokesman said Sunday that the army believed that numerous
"wanted terrorists" were hiding in hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian security officials said about 30 police officers were
captured by Israeli troops and trapped in a downtown office building.</TE>
<TE>   Col. Jibril Rajoub, security chief for the West Bank, told Al Jazeera
television that the men had been trying to surrender when troops opened
fire.</TE>
<TE>   The army gave a different account, saying its forces encountered an
armed Palestinian with explosives strapped to his body at the building.
They killed him and then engaged in a gun battle with other armed men at
the site, the army said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither report could be independently verified.</TE>
<TE>   For Sharon and Arafat, the current showdown is very personal.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, 74, and Arafat, 72, have fought for each other's mutual
destruction for years.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon launched Israel's highly controversial invasion of Lebanon in
1982 in pursuit of Arafat, who commanded the Palestine Liberation
Organization from Beirut. The Israeli general launched a "war on
terrorism" and lay siege to Arafat in his headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   But Arafat eventually was able to leave with thousands of men, regroup
and live to fight another day.</TE>
<TE>   Both men act today as though they are reliving those times, obsessed
with an old vendetta.</TE>
<TE>   "For him [Sharon], the score is still unsettled from then, waiting to
be closed," commentator Nahum Barnea wrote in the Israeli newspaper
Yediot Aharonot. "This explains Sharon's tremendous urge to humiliate
Arafat, a humiliation that has no logical use, but is just an old desire
for revenge."</TE>
<TE>Arafat Sees Himself as Phoenix or Martyr</TE>
<TE>   Arafat has cast himself as the phoenix who will rise from the
ashes--or a hero who will die a martyr's death.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing is not what I am facing," he told his
foreign visitors Sunday, "because for me it is not the first time. You
have to remember what happened in Beirut."</TE>

<HD>Telecom's Fiber Pipe Dream</HD>
<DH>Upstart firms saw riches in circling the globe with high-capacity
optic cable. Instead, they were laying the foundation for their own
downfall.</DH>

<LD>The world's phone calls, faxes and e-mails zip through strands of
glass no thicker than a human hair, riding across countries and
continents on pulses of multicolored light.</LD>
<LD>   The strands are bundled in cables that run beneath city streets,
through mountain passes and under the seas.</LD>
<LD>   The cables were laid by a band of upstart companies that spent $50
billion or more in the last few years to wire the planet. These massive
networks will serve the public for years to come, delivering the
electronic goods of the Digital Age.</LD>
<TE>   But the companies that built them are not celebrating. Many are in
financial ruin. The recent collapses of Global Crossing Ltd. and other
communications firms have roiled financial markets and cost investors and
employees tens of billions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   How did such a triumph of engineering leave so much corporate
wreckage?</TE>
<TE>   News reports of Global Crossing's meltdown have dwelt on accounting
sleight of hand and extravagant executive pay. But what actually drove
the company and others like it into the ground was an epic
miscalculation.</TE>
<TE>   These upstarts bet that if they built communications networks with far
more capacity, or bandwidth, than had ever been available before,
customers would rush to use them.</TE>
<TE>   The network builders employed new technology that crammed much more
data onto each strand of glass. This enabled them to slash prices for
long-distance data transmission well below the rates charged by
established networks, such as those of AT&amp;T Corp. and British Telecom,
that used older equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The newcomers believed that the combination of low prices and abundant
bandwidth would unleash a frenzy of activity on the Internet. Consumers
and businesses would pay for all kinds of services that previously had
been too expensive. People would watch Web movie channels on their TV
sets. Doctors would diagnose illnesses via the Internet. Corporations
would hold video conferences with employees around the world.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was that too many companies had the same dream, and they
built too many digital toll roads to the same destinations. The prices
commanded by long-distance networks did drop--but much more steeply than
the newcomers expected. And the demand for their services did rise--but
not nearly as much as they had banked on.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, many of the upstarts couldn't bring in enough cash to pay
interest on the money they borrowed to lay all that cable.</TE>
<TE>   Their plight is a textbook example of the boom-and-bust cycle of
high-tech capitalism. It illustrates how technological innovation,
plowing relentlessly forward, can make companies and then break them.</TE>
<TE>   The financial outlook is not universally bleak--many network operators
remain healthy, and some regions are not overloaded with fiber. But on
many of the routes that drew the heaviest investment, such as those
between the United States and Europe, the bandwidth glut is likely to
remain for five years or more.</TE>
<TE>   "People have laid huge amounts of fiber in the ground," said Internet
analyst Tony Marson of Probe Research Inc., "and there is a distinct
possibility that quite a lot of that will never actually see any
traffic."</TE>
<TE>Explosion of Internet Traffic Fueled Demand</TE>
<TE>   If any one person inspired the burst of network building, it would be
an English computer scientist named Tim Berners-Lee.</TE>
<TE>   The expert in storing and retrieving data invented the World Wide Web
in 1989 while working at a European nuclear research laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   Before then, Internet users had to type arcane computer commands to
search for and view files on the network. Berners-Lee devised a way to
present documents, pictures and graphics on electronic pages that could
be retrieved with the click of a mouse.</TE>
<TE>   The new technique transformed the Internet from a hard-to-use research
tool into a communications medium for the masses.</TE>
<TE>   Two developments in the early 1990s aided that transformation. First,
in 1992 Congress lifted the ban on commercial uses of the Net. Then, in
1993 and late 1994, the first easy-to-use browser programs were released,
simplifying the task of viewing or building a Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Up to that point, Internet use had doubled every year or so.
Afterward, traffic exploded, increasing tenfold in 1995 and again in
1996, according to researchers at AT&amp;T Labs.</TE>
<TE>   "People thought it could double every quarter forever," said analyst
Paras Bhargava of BMO Nesbitt Burns, a Canadian investment bank.</TE>
<TE>   As people and businesses began buying, selling and chatting online by
the millions, it seemed that no amount of Internet bandwidth would be
enough.</TE>
<TE>   "All these [dot-com] companies were cropping up, it seemed weekly, and
there was no end to that in sight," said Glenn Jasper of Ciena Corp., a
telecom equipment manufacturer in Maryland. "So the conventional wisdom
was we've got to grow the capacity of our networks not for the traffic
that's out there now or even next week but for a year from now."</TE>
<TE>   For years, those networks had been operated in the U.S. by a handful
of giant phone companies and abroad by government monopolies. These
companies relied on a small number of equipment suppliers, such as AT&amp;T's
Western Electric subsidiary.</TE>
<TE>   They lost their chokehold on the industry, however, just as Web
traffic was exploding. Governments around the world started prying open
their telecommunications markets to competition. At the same time,
advancing technology gave birth to a litter of new equipment suppliers
that specialized in fiber-optic gear.</TE>
<TE>   Long frozen out of the telecommunications business, investors suddenly
had a chance in the mid-to-late 1990s to crash the party. Venture
capitalists opened their checkbooks to bankroll new networks and
equipment companies. Investors jumped on board as soon as shares were
offered to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of money available," said Todd Brooks, a general
partner at Mayfield Funds, a venture capital firm in Menlo Park. "You had
billion-dollar IPOs, and the gold rush mentality set it."</TE>
<TE>   Before long, engineers were stringing glass around the globe--a "new
economy" version of the race to build railroads across America in the
19th century.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing and other companies tunneled under streets, carved
trenches and sent ships across the oceans, laying hundreds of thousands
of miles of fiber-optic cable. Many of the network builders were so sure
of the growth to come that they packed the cables with extra fibers that
were left inactive--"dark," in industry vernacular--for future use.</TE>
<TE>   But all the while, technology was advancing in a way that would delay
the need for those extra fibers--and, paradoxically, lure more
competitors into the fray.</TE>
<TE>   Fiber-optic networks use lasers to transmit light in split-second
flashes. Think of them as tiny, high-speed versions of the blinking
semaphore signals that ships use to communicate at sea.</TE>
<TE>   Equipment makers improved that technology in two ways: by speeding up
the flashes of light and by using different colors to send multiple
signals at the same time over a single fiber. These innovations greatly
expanded the capacity of fiber-optic networks.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics illustrate the magnitude of the change.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, the entire global communications network could transmit about
1 trillion pieces of data a second, said economist, author and technology
pundit George Gilder.</TE>
<TE>   Today, a single fiber strand has more than 1 1/2 times that capacity
if it uses the best optical equipment on the market.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., 10 of the largest networks had a total of about 40 such
fiber strands in service in 2000, according to a study by Probe Research,
based in Cedar Knolls, N.J. The networks also had 570 dark fibers waiting
in reserve. And since then, two emerging national data networks, Touch
America Inc. and Velocita Corp., have added more than 100 fibers to the
total.</TE>
<TE>   The increase in bandwidth is even more dramatic between the U.S. and
the rest of the world. For example, the capacity of networks linking the
United States and Europe has multiplied nearly 80 times since 1997, said
Richard Elliott, co-founder of the Band-X technology research group in
London.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of 2002, capacity is expected to nearly double again--and
that's just counting the fibers that are in service, not those left dark
to accommodate hoped-for growth.</TE>
<TE>Marketing to Businesses</TE>
<TE>   A catalyst in this explosion of capacity was Global Crossing. Unlike
AT&amp;T and other established long-distance companies, Global Crossing
showed little interest in consumers' phone calls. Instead, company
executives wanted to sell bandwidth wholesale to other long-distance
companies and corporations, which would use it for their own
communications needs.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's founder was financier Gary Winnick, a onetime
furniture salesman and investment banker who worked alongside junk-bond
king Michael Milken in Beverly Hills. Trumpeting the opportunities
presented by telecommunications deregulation and fiber optics, Winnick
raised $750 million in 70 days in 1997 for the first leg of his network:
an 8,700-mile cable from the United States to Britain, Germany and the
Netherlands.</TE>
<TE>   No single company had ever built an undersea cable with private
investors' money before. But when Global Crossing quickly found buyers
for all that new capacity, "any doubts about the need were quieted," said
Elliott of Band-X.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick soon had plenty of company on the fund-raising circuit. A host
of other entrepreneurs dazzled investors with charts showing the
skyrocketing growth of the Internet and the plummeting cost of doing
business.</TE>
<TE>   For example, James Q. Crowe, chief executive of Colorado-based Level
3, boasted that his company's state-of-the-art fiber network would
undercut its older rivals' prices by 15% to 20%. Crowe raised a reported
$6.5 billion before Level 3 had activated its first strand of fiber.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of companies sort of going at this in parallel,"
said Dave Passmore, research director at Burton Group, a network analysis
firm. "They all got in when they viewed this as an unexploited market."</TE>
<TE>   Ron Kline, an analyst for the telecommunications research firm RHK
Inc. in South San Francisco, said it wasn't necessarily wrong for a new
carrier to think it could win the battle for customers. "The problem was
there were too many people thinking about it."</TE>
<TE>   The greatest advantage went to the carrier with the newest technology
and highest capacity. It spent less to push data through its network than
its competitors did, which meant it could charge lower prices.</TE>
<TE>   So companies kept building networks even as the supply of bandwidth
grew well beyond demand. And as technology kept improving, the upstarts
soon had to compete with newer, more advanced players. No network could
hold on to its advantage for long.</TE>
<TE>   "In some bizarre movie about the telecom industry, you would have guys
from the carriers going out and killing guys in the labs to prevent them
from coming up with new technologies," said Ron Banaszek of TFS Telecom,
a Swiss consulting and investment firm for communications and energy
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Today, about 16 advanced transcontinental fiber networks are competing
in the U.S. long-distance business, said Larry Roberts of Caspian
Networks in San Jose, which supplies communications equipment. That's
three times as many as there were two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The increase in capacity and competition drove prices to the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Wholesalers such as Global Crossing typically sell companies a certain
amount of capacity from one city to the next--for example, enough to
transmit 155 million pieces of data a second from New York to London. A
bank with offices in those two cities might use that capacity to connect
its computers.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, that capacity cost about $14 million upfront, plus annual
fees of $250,000 to $380,000, said Elliott of Band-X. Today, the same
bandwidth could be bought for $350,000 upfront and $15,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>Industry Forecasts Were Too High</TE>
<TE>   So what happened to the burgeoning demand that was supposed to be the
industry's lifeblood?</TE>
<TE>   The extreme growth rates in Internet traffic seen in 1995 and 1996
were just a blip, reflecting the advent of Web browsers, said Andrew
Odlyzko, director of the Digital Technology Center at the University of
Minnesota. Since then, he said, the amount of data flowing over the Net
has reverted to its previous rate of increase, roughly doubling every
year.</TE>
<TE>   That's a lot of bits to move--but not nearly enough to fill the
networks built during the boom.</TE>
<TE>   One reason demand failed to mushroom as expected was the shortage of
bandwidth in local fiber-optic networks. Before consumers start
downloading symphonies or watching pay-per-view events online, they need
a high-speed connection to the Internet. But in the U.S., fewer than 10%
of all homes have one.</TE>
<TE>   There may be a data fire hose running from coast to coast, but the
typical consumer is still connecting through a straw.</TE>
<TE>   Many consumers are unwilling to pay the extra cost of a high-speed
line because, in their view, the Internet is not compelling or important
enough to justify it. The entertainment companies that could make the Net
more appealing to consumers, including most movie studios and TV
networks, are staying on the sidelines until more homes have high-speed
connections.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts and equipment makers argue that demand is growing faster
than the prevailing estimates indicate, increasing 2 1/2 to three times a
year on the main U.S. Internet pipelines. They argue that networks are
getting so jammed in some areas that long-distance companies will be
ordering more within a few months to a year.</TE>
<TE>   But even those growth estimates fall well short of the giddy
projections of a few years ago. And the situation may get worse before it
gets better, if Bankruptcy Court allows Global Crossing and other
insolvent carriers to write off their debt and stay in service.</TE>
<TE>   "That will launch a whole 'nother round of price wars that will cause
pain for everybody in the industry," said Russ McGuire, chief strategy
officer for telecommunications consultant TeleChoice Inc. "It will get
worse for everyone, and in the end, Global Crossing will still go away."</TE>

<HD>Catholics Take Comfort in Easter</HD>
<DH>Religion: In one Florida diocese, the sex scandal has not shaken
the faith of parishioners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>For Christians, the deepest meaning of Easter is that life follows
death, that hope can vanquish suffering. For American Catholics, who have
endured weeks of seamy, sorrowful revelations about the behavior of some
priests, that message Sunday held a special poignancy and comfort.</LD>
<LD>   On the holiest day in the church year, when the faithful celebrate the
resurrection of Jesus Christ and the promise of eternal life, Father John
Kasparek pointed during Mass to a tall white candle burning in front of
the altar. Its flame, the pastor told his congregation, "stands before us
as a reminder that Christ always breaks through the darkness."</LD>
<LD>   Though more than 50 priests in 17 U.S. dioceses have been forced out,
suspended or sidelined in the pedophilia scandal, no community of Roman
Catholics has been more shaken than the Diocese of Palm Beach on
Florida's Atlantic coast. Here, the last two bishops have quit because of
sexual involvement with minors, leaving many of its quarter-million
Catholics shocked and bewildered.</LD>
<TE>   When it comes to their granite-hard faith, though, it is a different
matter. Standing-room-only crowds attended Easter Mass at the Cathedral
of St. Ignatius Loyola in this comfortable suburb of West Palm Beach.
Attired in Easter finery and country-club casual, they came in such
numbers that their cars overflowed onto the church lawn.</TE>
<TE>   In his homily, Kasparek said all Americans were rocked out of their
complacency by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. And recently, the nation's
62 million Catholics "have also been shocked by the events in our church
that have cast a gloom of darkness upon us.</TE>
<TE>   "But as a community of the faithful, we believe our faith is rooted in
Jesus Christ alone, not in any minister, any bishop, any pope," he
continued. "Live as people of hope and follow the light of Christ."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the jam-packed services held throughout the morning,
parishioners came up to Kasparek and other clergy members and embraced
them as a sign of support. Claudine Cannezzaro, 30, a youth counselor,
said she left the service with her convictions renewed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is the time to put all of these things aside and go
forward," Cannezzaro said. "People have overreacted and forgotten that
all of the people involved in the church are men and women, and men and
women make mistakes. We need to pray for them."</TE>
<TE>   The diocese extends over five counties of southeastern Florida, from
the posh Palm Beach parish attended by the vacationing Kennedy clan out
to Everglades churches that minister to migrant Caribbean sugar cane
workers. On March 8, its members were stunned when their bishop, Anthony
J. O'Connell, resigned after admitting he had sexually fondled a teenage
seminary student in Missouri in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>Catholic Hierarchy Target of Criticism</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell had been named to this diocese by Pope John Paul II in 1999
after his predecessor, Bishop J. Keith Symons, became the first U.S.
Catholic prelate to quit because of sexual involvement with minors.
Symons admitted he molested altar boys while in another posting a
quarter-century earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "It was such a tragedy--Bishop O'Connell coming to the diocese, and
then these revelations coming forward--because he was so charismatic and
loved," said Samuel J. Barbaro, a deacon who serves as the diocese's
spokesman. "He had really embarked on healing all of the scars caused by
the first bishop resigning."</TE>
<TE>   If some churchgoers here expressed disappointment and suspicion
Sunday, it was about the conduct of the Catholic hierarchy, covering up
sexual acts involving priests and children for so many years. "In
solidarity with our priests," read a button pinned to usher Terry
Murphy's lapel.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety-five percent are good, good men," Murphy said. "It's the
bishops I'm mad at for allowing these things to happen. You see a bad
priest, and he just got transferred from parish to parish. When I was
growing up, I had the same parish priest for 30 years."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy said Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston and Cardinal Edward M. Egan
of New York--leading U.S. prelates whose subordinates have been
implicated in the pedophilia scandal--should step down for the good of
the church. "They had to have known what was going on," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the cover-up that is the big deal," said Zane Wright, 54,
another usher at St. Ignatius Loyola. "They are trying to protect the
reputation of the church. They don't want it tarnished. And we see where
that led."</TE>
<TE>   None of the incidents involving the former bishops occurred within
this diocese. In the event of one, Barbaro said a church policy set in
1985 calls for suspending the clergy member or layperson under suspicion
and convening a special investigative team. "If something has happened,
civil authorities would be notified immediately," Barbaro said. "The
diocese has made it clear that anyone knowing anything about child abuse
or sexual abuse should contact the diocese; they want to help."</TE>
<TE>   Father Tim O'Toole, who officiated at some of the Easter services
here, ended one Mass by calling on parishioners to reject sin and
temptation and "live as Jesus in this world." Afterward, he said church
members had shown him and his fellow priests nothing but loyalty and
support.</TE>
<TE>   "As I was saying in my homily," said O'Toole, 54, "we try to practice
what we preach."</TE>
<TE>'We Are No Longer Mindless Sheep'</TE>
<TE>   Some leading Catholics in the Palm Beach Diocese believe the
scandals--and the millions of dollars it will cost to settle lawsuits
with the victims--will bring about new and greater accountability of the
church leadership and an increased role by laymen and laywomen in setting
church policy.</TE>
<TE>   "The veil of secrecy has not only been pierced, but ripped asunder,"
said former priest William J. Brooks, 68, now a television executive who
chairs the Palm Beach town council. "The old boy clerical culture is
undergoing change. As tragic as it is with the young boys who were
victims, I see good things happening."</TE>
<TE>   "We are still the flock, but we are no longer mindless sheep," said
Brooks, who left the priesthood 30 years ago. "Father knows best was
extremely valid, even if he was wrong, a generation ago. Father may not
know best now."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the church is diving into the problem," said Philip D. Lewis,
72, a West Palm Beach real estate broker and former president of the
Florida Senate. "And I think the church, long haul, will be much
stronger. As we say, this too shall pass."</TE>

<HD>School Excels in Reading by Sticking With What Works</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD LEE COLVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>From outside, Seaton Elementary School doesn't look like a national
model for anything, except maybe urban decay. The windows of the beige
brick building are barred, the garden out back is littered with beer
bottles, and the adjacent blocks are scarred by the crumbling hulks of
once-graceful brownstones.</LD>
<LD>   But after being buzzed in past the security doors, a visitor can see
reading taught with an intensity and structure that the Bush
administration wants to replicate across the country.</LD>
<LD>   Test scores have soared at Seaton, as has enthusiasm for reading. That
has happened despite characteristics that have been barriers to learning
elsewhere: Virtually all of Seaton's students are poor enough to qualify
for federally subsidized meals, and English is not the first language for
a third of them.</LD>
<TE>   "These kids can do it . . . regardless of what people think, as long
as they're given appropriate instruction," said Seaton Principal Willy
Lamb. "Not that they don't come with some issues. But what we're trying
to do is deal with those issues while still teaching them."</TE>
<TE>   The school is being used to bolster the argument that the nation's
schools should stop embracing instructional fads and begin teaching
lessons grounded in cognitive and educational science.</TE>
<TE>   That culture shift is laid out in the education reform bill signed by
President Bush in January. The Education Department will hand out more
than $5 billion over the next five years for states to promote teaching
reading based on what the legislation calls "scientifically based reading
research."</TE>
<TE>   Not philosophy. Not instinct. Not hope. Science.</TE>
<TE>   At Seaton recently, preschoolers clamored over an inflated plastic
doll called "Miss F" and begged for the chance to write the letter on the
chalkboard. Then they all stood and stretched, touching their "fingers"
to their "feet."</TE>
<TE>   Such a lesson is based on research that has found that even
3-year-olds enjoy learning letters and sounds, giving them an early and
fun start on skills crucial for actual reading.</TE>
<TE>   Here, children begin reading in kindergarten. In one class, the
children gathered around teacher Mary Hale could barely contain
themselves as they repeated phrases such as "Andy Apple is an acrobat"
and read in unison words rhyming with "at."</TE>
<TE>   Second-graders during a recent visit were writing a response to a
story using words such as "quarrel" and "warrior." And in a fifth-grade
class, every student was able to flawlessly and passionately read his or
her lines in a play about the Underground Railroad heroics of Harriet
Tubman.</TE>
<TE>   None of that was happening five years ago. That's when Seaton became
one of nine District of Columbia schools in a federally sponsored study
of the effects of a structured phonics program bolstered by intensive
teacher training.</TE>
<TE>   The difference, said veteran fourth-grade teacher Mary Woods, is
"almost like night and day. These kids have a cockiness and a
self-confidence because they know how to attack words."</TE>
<TE>   That pleases Susan B. Neuman, assistant U.S. secretary of Education in
charge of overseeing the overhaul of reading lessons nationally.</TE>
<TE>   She began her career three decades ago in Berkeley, teaching in an
open classroom of first-, second- and third-graders. Back then, she said,
the dominant progressive philosophy held that children's natural
curiosity would help them learn to read more or less on their own. Neuman
and colleagues didn't so much as teach, she said, as they "trailed the
children as they went through activity, activity, activity."</TE>
<TE>   Some children did learn to read. But many did not. And they suffered
the consequences, Neuman recently told educators gathered in Washington
from 23 states to learn about the administration's Reading First and
Early Reading First programs.</TE>
<TE>   She left teaching after eight years for what was to turn out to be an
illustrious career as a reading researcher. But she used the experience
of seeing her students struggle as she sampled different techniques.</TE>
<TE>   "We do have evidence. We do know what works," Neuman told the
educators.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence was summed up in 2000 by the National Reading Panel,
mandated by Congress. To tap into the new federal reading money, states
will have to agree to promote teaching consistent with its findings.</TE>
<TE>   The money is far more than has ever before been made available.
California alone stands to receive $134 million from the program this
year and $147 million next year.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, the federal government has left such decisions to the
states. And, reading policy varies greatly. California, for example,
already mandates phonics in early reading lessons. Other states, such as
Connecticut, leave such decisions up to local districts.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, for at least 50 years, the dogma of how best to teach
reading has swung from one extreme to another, often amid rancorous
debate.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, "whole language" approaches that encouraged children to
intuit the nuts and bolts of how words worked have been losing out to the
direct teaching of the sounds associated with letters.</TE>
<TE>   Neuman said the administration's approach cannot properly be labeled
either "whole language" or "phonics." Rather, she said, it is
comprehensive and stresses direct teaching, as opposed to the
student-centered activities common when she began her career.</TE>
<TE>   To read well, children need to know phonics and how letter sounds
combine to form words, the reading panel concluded. But they also need
lessons focused on vocabulary, reading fluently, writing and techniques
to boost their understanding.</TE>
<TE>   Neuman and other administration officials point out that neither
phonics nor whole language alone has improved reading results. In fact,
reading achievement has stayed pretty much the same for decades.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent national snapshot shows that 68% of the nation's
fourth-graders, for example, are not proficient readers, meaning they
cannot analyze challenging materials. Among children from low-income
families, that figure soars to 86%.</TE>
<TE>   Though some say the standard is unrealistically high, the Bush
administration wants all children to be proficient readers within 12
years.</TE>
<TE>   But some experts say the practices the administration promotes go well
beyond what the reading panel recommends.</TE>
<TE>   P. David Pearson, dean of the UC Berkeley Graduate School of
Education, said the research cited by the panel says phonics lessons are
effective in kindergarten and first grade. Beyond that, he said, there's
little evidence to support their use.</TE>
<TE>   Pearson said he also worries that the administration is putting too
much emphasis on what's known as phonemic awareness, or the skill of
being able to detect the individual sounds within words. The panel's
research suggests about 18 hours of such lessons are all that's
necessary, he said. But widely used commercial programs devote far more
time than that to such training.</TE>
<TE>   Donna Ogle, an Illinois professor who is president of the influential
International Reading Assn., praised the administration for spotlighting
reading. But she said better teaching by itself is not enough.</TE>
<TE>   Where test scores are the lowest, she said, students move frequently,
they come to school hungry, discipline is lacking, class sizes are large
and buildings are often in disrepair.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're doing to teachers and principals in the worst schools is
ignoring the context in which they're educating kids," Ogle said.</TE>
<TE>   But the plan also has supporters, including major education groups
representing urban schools, school boards and teacher unions.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush announced this month that the American Federation of
Teachers volunteered to work with the administration to spread the word.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Unified School District, which began emphasizing
phonics from kindergarten to the second grade in 1999, is being cited as
a success story.</TE>
<TE>   Ronnie Ephraim, administrator in charge of the L.A. Unified reading
program, told the group in Washington that most schools now spend more
than three hours daily on reading-related lessons. The district has
invested millions in training primary teachers, and students' progress is
monitored every six weeks, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Reading scores for first-graders are now above the national average,
up 21 points in two years; second-graders' scores are up by 50%;
third-graders' by 30%. Such progress is winning over critics.</TE>
<TE>   Anna Maria Martinez, principal of Murchison Elementary School in East
Los Angeles, said first-graders are talking about metaphors and writing
"at levels we had never seen before."</TE>
<TE>   "For us, it was phenomenal," she said. She said veteran teachers,
initially skeptical, now are true believers and say "they'll never go
back."</TE>
<TE>   The district is using a phonics-based program called Open Court that
is gaining notice nationally. But Martinez said the investment in
training teachers has been as important to its success.</TE>

<HD>Panel Sets Rules for Constituting Grand Council</HD>
<DH>Politics: Women are to help choose new leaders, but critics assail
process for selecting delegates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>When 1,450 Afghans from all corners of the country gather in the
June heat to choose Afghanistan's future leadership, 160 seats will be
set aside for women and six for Islamic scholars.</LD>
<LD>   That's a marked change from the Taliban days, when religious men ran
the country and women were mostly banned from work. But according to
rules announced Sunday for the grand council, or loya jirga, there also
won't be an outright ban on members of the former Taliban regime.</LD>
<LD>   The loya jirga, Afghanistan's best hope for peace, will convene under
a huge tent June 10-16 to name a leader and government acceptable to the
country's disparate ethnic and tribal groups. If it fails, Afghanistan
risks a return to civil war.</LD>
<TE>   The ultimate prize is power and, even before the council begins,
various factions are expected to jockey for control of the most
influential posts--defense, interior forces, foreign ministry and police.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan is ruled by an interim government put in place at a
December summit in Germany. The leaders selected at the June meeting also
will be transitional, serving for 18 months. During that time, the loya
jirga will convene again to adopt a new constitution and procedures for
democratic elections.</TE>
<TE>   A special commission released details Sunday about how the loya jirga
members will be chosen. But some questions remained, notably on how
security for the selection process could be assured and how fairness
could be guaranteed in a country where provincial warlords dominate their
regions.</TE>
<TE>   With no broad popular election of loya jirga delegates, some Kabul
academics were disappointed that the process would not be more democratic
from the outset.</TE>
<TE>   The council will include 399 members representing the interim
administration, the special commission on the loya jirga and groups such
as women, refugees, academics and nomads. The remaining 1,051 members
will be indirectly elected from Afghanistan's 32 provinces. Each province
will choose a pool of representatives by consensus, and they will in turn
elect delegates to the loya jirga from among themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Regional teams, which will include international representatives, will
monitor the procedures and settle disputes.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it's hard to expect that in a short time, after 23 years of
fighting and bloodshed and all these appalling situations, that we have
settled everything and all the problems have been tackled," conceded
Ismail Qasimyar, chairman of the special commission.</TE>
<TE>   "Every possible effort will be made to create an atmosphere conducive
to free and fair elections," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Three Kabul University professors interviewed by The Times were
critical of the process, arguing that the special commission reflected
the interests of competing factions that would put their own interests
first.</TE>
<TE>   "In this kind of situation, when there are commanders ruling
everywhere all over the country, how can we talk of democracy?" said
Akhmad Zia Nikbin, head of the sociology department at the university.</TE>
<TE>   Barred from participating are individuals involved in terrorism, drug
trafficking, human rights abuses, war crimes and the killing of innocent
people. The illiterate also are banned.</TE>
<TE>   But Aziz Rakhmand, head of the Kabul University history department,
said he believes that former Taliban members would get onto the loya
jirga regardless of past activities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a political game to cheat the people and the world community,"
he said, adding that local warlords have the money and power to determine
who is elected to the loya jirga.</TE>
<TE>   History professor Hulam Habib Panjsheri predicted that violence and
intimidation would take place in eastern Afghanistan, where the Taliban
still has support, and in the southwest and west of the country.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no doubt that the loya jirga will have corruption and
injustice," he said.</TE>

<HD>Britons Hail Popular Royal and Look Ahead</HD>
<DH>Europe: As admirers of Queen Mum flock to pay respects, observers
wonder how her loss will change family's role.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<AU>JANET STOBART</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>Admirers of Queen Elizabeth the queen mother gathered outside
Britain's royal palaces Sunday to bid goodbye to a beloved symbol of the
nation's imperial history and ponder what her death means for the future
of the monarchy.</LD>
<LD>   They brought spring bouquets in the pastel colors favored by the royal
matriarch and left condolence notes for Queen Elizabeth II, who has lost
her mother and her sister, Princess Margaret, in less than two months.</LD>
<LD>   The Queen Mum was hailed by commoners and aristocrats alike as the
mainstay of the royal family and its most popular member. Her death
Saturday at 101 deprives the queen of her closest ally and the nation of
a unifying royal figure.</LD>
<TE>   "She was a piece of history," said Lesley Reeves, 43, an East London
financial advisor who turned up at Windsor Castle to pay her respects.
"We never met her, but somehow she's always been a part of our lives."</TE>
<TE>   After a nightlong vigil outside the Windsor gates, Tracey Warner, 19,
observed: "She was somebody you could look up to. I don't think it will
be the same now she's gone."</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1900, when Queen Victoria reigned and the British Empire
encompassed a fifth of the Earth's landmass and a quarter of its
population, the elder Elizabeth served as the last empress of India
before the subcontinent was granted independence in 1947. She was an
Edwardian aristocrat, scornful of modern royal penny-pinching, who saw
the world from the age of radio to the frontier of genetic engineering.</TE>
<TE>   Through it all, she managed to present herself as royal and commoner
at once. She was a trout fisherwoman with 50 servants and a people's
queen who couldn't make ends meet on $1 million a year in state support.
Cheered by the sight of her cocked head and perennial smile, Britons
loved her.</TE>
<TE>   "Always had a great deal of respect for you, ma'am," Barry Shaw of
Bermondsey, in southeastern London, wrote in a note left outside Clarence
House, Elizabeth's London residence. "You've touched a great many people
from all walks of life. . . . As we say in south London with greatest
respect, R.I.P. Queen Mum."</TE>
<TE>   Waiting in line to sign a condolence book, Aaron David, 26, of
Gateshead, said, "We are definitely poorer for losing her."</TE>
<TE>   So, said many royal watchers, is the monarchy.</TE>
<TE>   The queen mother's passing removes a generational buffer between Queen
Elizabeth and mortality, and--although healthy and hard-working--the
queen will suddenly be perceived as an older 75-year-old. But though her
mother's longevity suggests that the queen could rule for 20 more years
or so, the death pushes to the forefront questions about Prince Charles'
suitability to be king, his relationship with the divorced Camilla Parker
Bowles, the cost of the royal family and, most important, its
constitutional role.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Elizabeth ushered the royal family through the crisis of
abdication in 1936, when her husband took the throne as King George VI
after his brother, King Edward VIII, abdicated to marry American divorcee
Wallis Simpson, and she steered it through divorce scandals involving her
grandchildren in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Her death now may bring Queen Elizabeth renewed empathy and support in
a year of Golden Jubilee celebrations. But if the queen mother was the
most popular royal, will her absence make the royal family less popular?</TE>
<TE>   Her death, the Sunday Times wrote, "comes at a time when, partly
thanks to her efforts, the monarchy has entered calmer waters. Public
enthusiasm may have waned. . . . But there is now, even for those who do
not support the monarchy, a far greater tolerance for its existence.
Those who refuse to acknowledge it does much good at least no longer
accuse it of doing much harm. Compared with just a few years ago, that is
a significant step forward."</TE>
<TE>   Other political observers, however, suggested that the queen mother
left a void that makes a referendum on the future of the monarchy--and
the monarch's role as constitutional head of state--more conceivable.</TE>
<TE>   "For all of the affection with which the Queen Mother was held, she
increasingly represented a world, constitutional order and culture that
are fading. We are as much nostalgic about what she stood for as
grieving," the Observer said in an editorial Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "The royal family she built now needs a new lease of creativity if it
is still to be venerated as having a key role in Britain's national life
in years ahead."</TE>
<TE>   The republican paper suggested that the family might best become "no
more than a distinguished national family that can nominate its own head
without constitutional implications"--patrons of charities, not
constitutional heads of state.</TE>
<TE>   But first the country will hold a period of national mourning and a
funeral April 9 likely to be reminiscent of its grandest past--the queen
mother helped orchestrate it.</TE>
<TE>   Her coffin, now at Windsor, will be taken to London to lie in state
before a Westminster Abbey service and burial with her late husband.</TE>
<TE>   The coffin will go first to the Queen's Chapel at St. James's Palace,
close to Clarence House, where members of the royal family will pay their
private tributes. Then it will be taken to Westminster Hall and placed on
a purple-draped catafalque where George VI lay in state in February 1952.
It will be guarded around the clock by a ceremonial contingent of Yeomen
of the Guard.</TE>
<TE>   After the funeral, the coffin will be taken by road to Windsor, where
it will be interred in the black marble vault of the George VI Memorial
Chapel, specially built at St. George's Chapel as the final resting place
of the king. Princess Margaret's ashes will be buried with the queen
mother.</TE>

<HD>They're Having Some Fun Now</HD>
<DH>Recreation: The end of the Taliban has brought a wave of leisure
activities, junk food and a new Afghan film.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>There wasn't a shred of red carpet or kernel of popcorn at the
first movie premiere in the new Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   But that didn't stop the buzz.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, hundreds of amped-up kids, gun-toting soldiers, wizened old
men, and women hidden beneath burkas streamed into an auditorium here to
watch a screening of the first movie made in Afghanistan since anyone can
remember.</LD>
<TE>   Some dabbed tears from the corners of their eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Others, like Shojaudin Zaka, blurted out: "Get the goat! Get the
goat!"</TE>
<TE>   The 14-year-old boy had never seen a movie before, let alone a wild
buzkashi player thundering across the screen. He couldn't help but offer
some advice.</TE>
<TE>   "Chapandaz" is a bona fide Afghan production, the first film since
before the Taliban came to power in 1996 to be shot, edited and released
in this land of mountains and war. It also is a celebration of the
distinctive Afghan pastime of buzkashi, or goat polo.</TE>
<TE>   "A country without its own movies," lead actor Seqiq Habidi said as he
scribbled autographs after the show, "is a country without soul."</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban forces weren't exactly amusement specialists. And now that
they're gone, a new craze for leisure activities is sweeping this
northern city and the rest of the country.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the reinvigorated film industry, there's dog fighting, camel
fighting, motorcycle stunts, cotton candy stands (here it's called "sweet
wool"), new junk-food products like Soft &amp; Fresh bubble gum--even porn.</TE>
<TE>   Karaoke? It's coming. At night, as the sun sinks below the edge of the
steppe, boisterous young men pack Mazar-i-Sharif's cassette kiosks, crank
up the music to Indian movies and sing along.</TE>
<TE>   "Chal mere bhai!"--"Let's go, my brother!"--one man belted out the
other night.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban banned all such diversions, even kite flying.</TE>
<TE>   "They used to tell us, 'That which entertains does evil,' " recalled
Dost Mohammed Raghab, a 43-year-old Mazar secretary.</TE>
<TE>   The regime's suggested form of recreation: zeker, or sitting in a room
alone and reciting holy words.</TE>
<TE>   Few places in the world have had a curtain of oppression fall so
fast--and lift so suddenly. The combination has left many Afghans
delighting in the simplest of pleasures.</TE>
<TE>   Like packaging with faces on it, prohibited by the Taliban, which
declared two-dimensional images of man unholy. These days, the hottest
purse in Mazar is a bag sewn from smiling shampoo packets.</TE>
<TE>   Even the nightly curfew has a charm to it. In Mazar and other cities,
each night is given a name, usually a flower or animal, and this is used
as a password for those authorized to be out past the deadline. When
passersby approach, the soldiers at the checkpoints yell out, in Dari:
"What is the name of the night?"</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night it was tawooz, or peacock.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an energy to being here," said Peter Bussian of the
International Rescue Committee, "to being in the exact right spot, at the
exact right time."</TE>
<TE>   The defeat of the Taliban in November didn't mark just the end of a
hard-line regime. It meant the end of isolation. Many countries that had
refused to trade with Afghanistan are now rushing products back in.</TE>
<TE>   Every day, there's a new brand of soda or cookie or gum in the market:
Ashi Mashi cola from Iran; Magic Kiwi soda from Uzbekistan; cookies from
China, Russia, Egypt and India; Turkish Combat-5 bubble gum, a favorite.</TE>
<TE>   "Six months ago," said merchant Esmat Sakhi, holding up a shriveled
orange, "this is what you'd see."</TE>
<TE>   Juice shops are lined with "Titanic" posters, and the 5-year-old movie
is so beloved here, the word has entered the popular lexicon.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want good kebabs," driver Mohammed Hussein said as he sat
down at a cafe the other day. "Bring me titanic kebabs."</TE>
<TE>   In pursuit of a different kind of entertainment, at the Firhat Hotel,
men watch Italian sex films--in the same lobby where they drop to their
knees and pray facing Mecca. The pornography is beamed in via a new
satellite dish.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, it is seriously forbidden," said bellboy Mohammed Hakim. "But we
are curious."</TE>
<TE>   Since the Taliban left, there also has been a return to dog fighting,
a traditional Friday pastime, and the occasional camel fight.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's NASCAR, Afghan style.</TE>
<TE>   A team of entrepreneurs recently built a 30-foot-high, 30-foot-wide
barrel near the center of Mazar and dubbed it the "Wall of Death."</TE>
<TE>   Twenty times a day, a solo motorcycle driver on an aged 125cc Suzuki
races around the barrel, climbing higher and higher up the walls, defying
gravity and sticking to the sides.</TE>
<TE>   Each show is jammed with dozens of marveling men and boys clinging to
a rickety scaffolding built around the mouth of the barrel.</TE>
<TE>   The driver zoomed around 10 times, maybe 12. Centrifugal force kept
him up. The crowd loved it, especially when the flimsy scaffolding nearly
folded as the motorcycle flew past.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it's a very basic form of entertainment. But after all this
country has been through, maybe there's nothing mysterious about why
people are so happy watching something go round and round, without
falling down.</TE>

<LD>About 80,000 protesters gathered in the capital, Chisinau, calling
for the resignation of the communist government.</LD>
<LD>   Most of Moldova was part of Romania until 1940, and two-thirds of its
people are of Romanian descent. Its Russian-speaking minority is in the
trans-Dniester area and Chisinau.</LD>
<LD>   Since the 1991 Soviet collapse, Moldova has struggled with whether to
align with Romania or Russia. Communists who won elections last year
favor closer ties with Russia.</LD>

oil-producing areas early this year.</LD>
<LD>   The government denied the claims and said the army had repelled a

<LD>Ukraine's Communist Party, allies of President Leonid D. Kuchma and
a pro-Western opposition leader jockeyed today for the lead in
parliamentary elections, according to preliminary results.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday's vote was seen as a gauge of Kuchma's popularity after eight
years of leading the nation. The final outcome was seen hinging on
whether voters stuck with Kuchma's controversy-shadowed but stable
leadership or opted for reform.</LD>
<LD>   With 11% of the vote counted, the Communist Party had 19.6%. The
pro-presidential For United Ukraine and the reformist Our Ukraine bloc of
ex-Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko each had 19%, according to the
Election Commission.</LD>
<TE>   The official tally differed starkly from exit polls that indicated a
much weaker showing for the pro-presidential party and had buoyed the
opposition.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf is confident voters will give
him five more years in power if he decides to call a referendum on his
rule, Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Musharraf, who took power in a coup in October 1999, says he needs
more time to push through the economic and political reforms needed to
bring stability to his country.</LD>
<LD>   "He's considering to go for a referendum, and he feels he will have a
direct mandate from the people," Haider said in an interview in Kuala
Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, where he is to attend an Organization of
the Islamic Conference meeting on terrorism that starts today.</LD>
<TE>   Musharraf told journalists in Pakistan on Saturday that a decision on
a referendum would be made within a week. The country's Election
Commission said a referendum should be held within a month of its
announcement.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Officials Hope Detainee Is Key Suspect</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Authorities begin interrogating man captured in
Pakistan to determine if he is anAl Qaeda commander.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<AU>BOB DROGIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>U.S. officials scrambled Sunday for conclusive evidence that they
have captured one of Osama bin Laden's top commanders, and began the
process of interrogating the man for information about Al Qaeda terrorist
plots that may already be underway.</LD>
<LD>   If the suspect shot and wounded during a raid in Pakistan on Thursday
is indeed the shadowy military commander known as Abu Zubeida,
authorities have in their custody the man apparently entrusted with
overseeing Al Qaeda's global network of terror cells for the
higher-profile Bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   Zubeida would be, by far, the most senior Bin Laden associate captured
since President Bush declared war on international terrorism following
the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. authorities believe that Zubeida, whose real name is thought to
be Zain al-Abidin Mohammed Husain, may have helped plan the Sept. 11
attacks. They also have information indicating that he played a role in
the so-called millennium plots to bomb Los Angeles International Airport
and tourist sites in Jordan, as well as in other major Al Qaeda terrorist
attacks of recent years. He has been tried in absentia in Jordan, and
sentenced to death, for his role in the plot there.</TE>
<TE>   Zubeida's capture would be a devastating blow to Al Qaeda's efforts to
regroup and redeploy its operatives in the face of military and law
enforcement crackdowns around the world, law enforcement and intelligence
officials said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't say it with 100% certainty," said one U.S. official. "But it
sure looks like him.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a major setback for the Al Qaeda organization," said the
official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Several U.S. officials said that the man believed to be Zubeida was
apprehended with about 30 other suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban members
Thursday during a joint raid by FBI officials, a few CIA operatives and
Pakistani authorities in Faisalabad, Pakistan. One U.S. official said
that the man, who bears a striking resemblance to photographs of Zubeida,
was shot several times as he attempted to escape.</TE>
<TE>   "He is undergoing medical treatment and will be interrogated about his
knowledge of ongoing terrorist activities," said the official.</TE>
<TE>Global Cooperation</TE>
<TE>   The raid was one of several recent anti-terrorist actions in which the
FBI and the CIA have actively participated with law enforcement personnel
in other countries, instead of just providing intelligence information
and support, according to U.S. officials. They described those actions as
a significant advance in the effort to eradicate terrorism around the
world and, in particular, to smash Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   "It signifies that there is a new set of rules post-9/11, with greater
cooperation between us and other countries," said one Bush administration
official. "This is the new meat and potatoes of counterterrorism, with
the U.S. and host governments working together to arrest these people. We
have seen it in the Philippines, we have seen it in Yemen, and now we are
seeing it in Pakistan."</TE>
<TE>   The raid was also significant in that it resulted in the apprehension
of dozens of possible terrorist suspects from a variety of countries. The
men captured appeared to be actively involved in "an important Al Qaeda
cell, from the nature of the communications and the substance of what
they were talking about," according to one counterterrorism authority.</TE>
<TE>   The raid was based, at least in part, on communications intercepts and
other intelligence information provided by the CIA, said one U.S.
official.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. authorities, citing security concerns, said Sunday that they had
not conclusively determined if Zubeida was among those captured. They
declined to say where--or in whose custody--the suspect is being held.</TE>
<TE>   "They are trying to figure out for sure if it is him," said the Bush
administration official. "It's not like Bin Laden, where you can grab a
lock of hair from one of his brothers and do a DNA match. Unless he
decides to talk, it may take a while to figure out if it is really him."</TE>
<TE>Seeking Identity Clues</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are using several techniques to determine whether the man
is Zubeida, they said, from interrogating him to running forensic tests.
They are also showing the man's photograph to individuals who know
Zubeida.</TE>
<TE>   If Zubeida has indeed been apprehended, the Bush official said, U.S.
authorities will have hit what he described as "the Al Qaeda jackpot."</TE>
<TE>   "If it is him, this is obviously huge," the official said, noting that
U.S. authorities have been tracking Zubeida for years.</TE>
<TE>   Zubeida, a relatively young member of Al Qaeda's leadership, is known
as a charismatic and elusive militant who rose quickly from jihad soldier
to commander to gatekeeper of Al Qaeda's training camps in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   From a way station in Pakistan, just across the border from
Afghanistan, Zubeida spent years receiving incoming soldiers sent from Al
Qaeda cells around the world and determining what kind of training they
would need before returning to their home countries, according to
counterterrorism authorities in the United States and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Zubeida also has traveled extensively to Europe, Asia and Africa to
orchestrate and activate terrorist plots, maintain liaisons with terror
cells and screen would-be guerrillas for training, authorities said. He
has used at least 37 aliases and accompanying fake passports and
identification documents from Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan
and perhaps Morocco, according to a confidential U.S. investigative
document obtained by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Zubeida took on an even larger role within Al Qaeda after the United
States launched military strikes in Afghanistan in October, assuming the
role of chief military strategist after one of Bin Laden's chief
lieutenants, Mohammed Atef, was reported killed in November, authorities
believe.</TE>
<TE>   So little is known about Zubeida that even his country of origin and
his age are in question. He is believed to be about 30 years old. While
some identity documents indicate that he was born in Saudi Arabia, some
authorities say he is a Palestinian from the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Zubeida's apparent capture reverberated among
counterterrorism authorities worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   "He will be the highest-ranking Al Qaeda member [in custody], with
intimate details spanning many years of the inner workings of how Al
Qaeda made decisions, of their plots and the details of the
organization," said Dr. Magnus Ranstorp, deputy director of the Center
for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence at the University of
St. Andrews in Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   But like some U.S. officials, Ranstorp questioned whether Zubeida's
capture would ultimately help in the ongoing terrorism investigations
underway in Europe, Asia and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "I doubt they would be able to make him talk," Ranstorp said. "These
are hard people to break, not only in terms of ideological indoctrination
and religious commitment. They are also very skilled in
counterinterrogation techniques."</TE>
<TE>   Zubeida, he said, "has been in the battle for a long time, he is
battle-hardened."</TE>

<LD>A gunman opened fire on a kosher butcher shop in southern
France--the fourth apparent anti-Semitic attack over the weekend--drawing
pledges for increased security at Jewish sites and appeals for religious
tolerance.</LD>
<LD>   No one was hurt in the attack Saturday evening in the town of L'Union,
near Toulouse, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The owner of the shop was inside when a gunman fired two shots and

<HD>Cranes Fall in Taiwan, Killing Five</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TAIPEI, Taiwan
</DL>
<LD>Cranes and scaffolding at a high-rise building site crashed to the
ground after a powerful earthquake jolted Taiwan on Sunday, killing five
construction workers, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Two aftershocks, measuring magnitudes 4.8 and 4.5, shook the eastern
part of the island today, setting off landslides. No injuries were
reported.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, more than 200 mostly minor injuries were reported across
the island as the quake started fires, shattered windows and cracked
walls. Local officials said the quake registered magnitude 6.8, but the
U.S. Geological Survey estimated it at magnitude 7.1.</LD>
<TE>   Two cranes fell from the 60th floor of a high-rise building under
construction in Taipei, the capital. Television footage showed the cranes
tumbling, bringing steel beams and chunks of cement with them.</TE>
<TE>   Police identified the victims as two crane operators and three other
construction workers. Dozens of other workers ran down from the structure
safely, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 people were hurt by the falling debris, including a woman
whose hand was severed when part of a crane crashed onto her car.</TE>

<HD>A Sense of Duty Gets U.S. Troops Through Easter</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Keeping their mission in mind, GIs and Marines far
from home mark the day in their own ways.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>It wasn't much of an Easter, standing guard at the outer entrance
of this burgeoning international military installation north of Kabul,
but there was a beautiful sunrise over the snow-capped peaks and a spring
blossoming of apple trees along the hard-packed road about 6:30 a.m.
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   While some of his peers were at a sunrise service, Pfc. Jason Cheely
of Atlanta, a military policeman in the U.S. Army's 10th Mountain
Division, was hard at work, trying out his pidgin Dari on the local
Afghans whom he questioned and frisked before letting them through his
gate.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not like being home with your family. You can't hide eggs in a
land-mine field," said Cheely, based at Fort Drum in upstate New York.</LD>
<TE>   He'd already missed Christmas and New Year's. "I've missed just about
a year's worth of holidays. I guess it's for a good reason. So they
understand."</TE>
<TE>   For most of the men and women of the U.S. military, and for their
international partners from Britain, Poland, Spain and a variety of other
countries here keeping up the fight against remnants of the Taliban and
Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, the day was much like any other.</TE>
<TE>   But for the more active Christians among the troops, there was an
added meaning to the day.</TE>
<TE>   The khaki church tent--the only one in Bagram's "tent city" here with
a vestibule--was standing room only when a Polish army chaplain, Father
Augustyn Rosly, a Roman Catholic, and a U.S. Army chaplain, Father Bob
McMeekin, a Russian Orthodox cleric from St. Croix Falls, Wis., teamed up
for a bilingual Easter Mass.</TE>
<TE>   McMeekin, who read an English translation of Rosly's Polish sermon and
also led the singing, said the ecumenical exercise was the largest
worship service he'd had since arriving on this dusty plate of land laid
out under the eaves of the majestic Hindu Kush. "Now that you all know
where the chapel is, I expect to see you back here next Sunday," he
chided the men.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Col. Bob Cendrowski of Mount Holly, N.J., whose work on safety
issues has not left him a lot of free time on Sundays to worship, said he
got a lot out of it. "I feel it is a time to reflect and to take time and
think about the peace of Easter, the peace of Christ, and hope for this
war-torn land, and to realize we can make a difference here."</TE>
<TE>   For the 87 Polish soldiers at Bagram--mostly engineers and
logisticians--Easter (which is Wielkanoc or "Great Night" in their
language) included a breakfast banquet with tablecloths and napkins and a
centerpiece made out of a particular type of salty mountain cheese shaped
in the form of a pascal lamb.</TE>
<TE>   The fare was hard-boiled eggs, sausages, pickles and bread from home,
and a cabbage and sausage hunter's stew called bigos.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. GIs and Marines had nothing out of the ordinary: breakfast of
tepid eggs and grits and cold cereal served out from the mess tents on
rough picnic tables.</TE>
<TE>   Lunch was the standard MRE--Meals Ready to Eat--in such enticing
varieties as beef stew and spaghetti and meatballs.</TE>
<TE>   For the night's hot meal, though, the cooks were promising the men and
women cordon bleu.</TE>
<TE>   The graffiti in the portable toilets gave an insight into what some of
the American fighters are thinking, reflections rougher and more obscene
than the for-public-consumption comments that they make to the reporters
who are permitted to roam more or less freely in the compound.</TE>
<TE>   Spc. Peter Tubiolo, 28, of Monterey, Calif., a former Marine who has
moved over to the Army, said inside a massive Soviet-built hangar on the
base that it was a very fine Easter.</TE>
<TE>   As he pried his prepackaged lunch--Jamaican-style pork chops--out of
its thick plastic shell, he said he had a roof over his head and food to
eat and he did not need to ask for much more than that.</TE>
<TE>   His companion, Pfc. Travis Bell of Shelby, N.C., 28, was satisfied
too. Of course it was lonely to be away from America on the holidays. But
echoing Cheely at the gate, he said, "You know you're here for a reason."</TE>

<DL>VATICAN CITY
</DL>
<LD>Struggling with his own physical suffering, Pope John Paul II used
his Easter message to issue a forceful plea for an end to a bloody spiral
of violence that has created "horror and despair" in the Holy Land.</LD>
<LD>   After Israel launched a sweeping retaliation for a string of
Palestinian suicide bombings, John Paul dedicated much of the address to
the conflict.</LD>
<LD>   Assisted by two cardinals, the frail 81-year-old pope celebrated Mass
on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica.</LD>
<TE>   At the end of the 1 1/2-hour Mass, the pope managed to raise his voice
in a denunciation of Middle East bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   Remarking glumly that it appeared that "war has been declared on
peace," John Paul called on political and religious leaders to do what
they can to "help everyone to rediscover mutual respect and return to
frank negotiation."</TE>

<HD>'No Compromise With Terrorism'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The following is a text of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's
televised address Sunday explaining his nation's 3-day-old military
offensive. The speech was delivered in Hebrew and translated into English
by the Associated Press.</LD>
<LD>   Citizens of Israel:</LD>
<LD>   The state of Israel is in a war, a war against terrorism. This is a
war that was imposed on us. It is not a war that we decided to embark
upon. This is a war over our home.</LD>
<TE>   The state of Israel, under my direction, made all the efforts to
arrive at a cease-fire. All the time, since I was elected, in the midst
of a wave of Palestinian terror, we placed before us the goal of doing
everything to achieve calm and arrive at political accords.</TE>
<TE>   We cooperated with the U.S. envoy, Anthony Zinni, and we received
terrorism in return. We acted together with Vice President Dick Cheney,
and we received terrorism in return. We decided to advance the prospects
of a cease-fire and concede my demand for seven days of quiet, and we
received terrorism in return. We withdrew military forces from the
cities, and we received terrorism in return. Everything we received in
return for our efforts was terrorism, terrorism and more terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   We must fight against this terrorism, fight with no compromise, pull
up these wild plants by the roots, smash their infrastructure, because
there is no compromise with terrorism. It is impossible to compromise
with one who is prepared, like the suicide [bombers] on the streets of
Israel's cities and in the twin towers in the United States, to die only
to kill innocent civilians, children, women and infants. To die in order
to cause fear and horror. This terrorism is activated, directed and
initiated by one man--the chairman of the Palestinian Authority, Yasser
Arafat. Arafat is at the head of a coalition of terrorism. He operates a
strategy of terrorism. The chairman of the Palestinian Authority is an
enemy of Israel. He is the enemy of the entire free world. Everyone who
seeks freedom, everyone who was brought up on the values of freedom and
democracy must know that Arafat is an obstacle to peace in the Mideast.
Arafat is a danger to the whole region.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli government decided at its meeting on Thursday to begin a
wide-ranging operation to root out the terrorist infrastructure in the
Palestinian territories. We will clean out the terrorist infrastructure
from the foundations, because in the end we know that the only way to
reach a cease-fire, negotiations, an accord, an agreement and peace is if
we succeed in wiping out the terrorism infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   The state of Israel seeks peace. Our hand is and always will be
extended for peace with the Palestinian people and the people of the
whole region. But no one should be deluded. Our extended hand does not
mean that we will give in to terrorism or to terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Citizens of Israel: The state of Israel stands at a crossroads of its
history. The situation is not easy, but we have known worse situations
than this, and we overcame them all. This time, too, we will emerge
victorious. This time, too, we will win, and when that happens, we will
be able to live here together in peace.</TE>

<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>World leaders sought guarantees from Israel that Yasser Arafat
would not be harmed in its new military offensive, warning Sunday that
the siege of the Palestinian leader's headquarters could lead to
catastrophe.</LD>
<LD>   Israel has said it has no intention of harming Arafat and instead aims
to isolate him as it launches a campaign against militants after a string
of Palestinian attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said in an address to his people
that Israel was "at war" and vowed to destroy a "terrorist
infrastructure" he said was directed by Arafat.</LD>
<TE>   Arab leaders were not convinced Israel would refrain from harming the
Palestinian leader.</TE>
<TE>   If Arafat is harmed, "the resistance will go on because each
Palestinian is Yasser Arafat," Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not a surprise at all for a man like Sharon, with his known
past, to attempt to harm Arafat and our brotherly Palestinian people,"
the de facto ruler said, according to the Saudi state news agency.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, one of only two nations to have signed a peace accord with
Israel, summoned Israel's ambassador and threatened to take unspecified
measures in its ties with Israel unless the action was immediately
stopped, said Information Minister Mohammed Affash Udwan.</TE>
<TE>   Morocco's King Mohammed VI telephoned Sharon to seek a guarantee that
Arafat would not be harmed, a diplomatic official said in Rabat, the
Moroccan capital. The king also urged Sharon to halt military operations
and respect a U.N. resolution passed Saturday calling on Israel to
withdraw troops from Palestinian cities.</TE>
<TE>   European nations echoed demands that Israel comply with the
resolution, which also calls on both sides to cooperate with U.S. truce
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said the escalation of
violence risked "a destabilization of the entire region" and urged Israel
to guarantee Arafat is not hurt.</TE>
<TE>   China fears "disastrous consequences" for the Middle East "if
unexpected incidents took place to Arafat's safety," Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan told his Israeli counterpart, Shimon Peres, in a phone call,
the New China News Agency reported.</TE>
<TE>   Several leaders said that Arafat had no means of halting the spiraling
violence while trapped inside his office, where phone lines and
electricity have been cut.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not think that Arafat is in a situation where he can manage
this," Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson said in a radio interview.</TE>
<TE>   French President Jacques Chirac, in a TV interview, cautioned both
Israelis and Palestinians against a policy of "force and terror."</TE>

<HD>A Hollow Victory for Old-Growth Camp</HD>
<DH>Trees: Major Northwest timber company has pledged to end logging of
old forests. But many such tracts are already on the chopping block.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROSEBURG, Ore.
</DL>
<LD>This is America's timber country. The rolling green carpets that
sweep into the mountains are home both to 28 million acres of commercial
forest and to the largest stand of old-growth timber in the world.</LD>
<LD>   Most people here in Douglas County have never thought twice about
cutting a few trees--not surprising in a place where unemployment is at
11% and a third of the jobs left are linked to the forest.</LD>
<LD>   But while the demand for new logging continues to be heard in timber
towns across the Pacific Northwest, it appears there is substantial
public support for setting aside the stands of huge, old trees that have
all but disappeared except for on the lush, rain-fed slopes of the
western Cascades.</LD>
<TE>   When asked recently whether they favored an end to logging in
old-growth forests on public lands, 63% of residents in
resource-dependent areas such as Douglas County said yes. So did 70% of
those in Oregon and Washington overall.</TE>
<TE>   And in what could be an important shift by the timber industry, Boise
Cascade Corp., now known simply as Boise, announced last month that it
would end all logging on large stands of old-growth forest. The company,
the largest purchaser of federal timber in the country, cited the
dwindling availability of old trees, mostly due to environmental
controls.</TE>
<TE>   "Less than 1% of the wood we use in our manufacturing operations comes
from what most people would consider old growth," Boise spokesman Mark
Moser said. "And the direction of federal forest policy management was to
offer less and less old growth for sale. It was sort of an evolution that
we got to, and we decided we might as well discontinue it altogether."</TE>
<TE>   But conservationists say consumer pressure for products free of
old-growth fiber also was a factor.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that what we've seen in the last six or seven years is a
shift in public sentiment. . . . People see the converting of
800-year-old trees into 2-by-4s or copy paper as just being barbaric and
unnecessary," said Michael Brune of the Rainforest Action Network. The
conservation group has led a consumer drive against Boise and other firms
to shut down logging on old-growth forests.</TE>
<TE>   Though logging on public lands always has been controversial, at issue
now are forests that may be anywhere from 150 to 800 years old--areas
sometimes called "cathedral" forests, with towering, moss-draped stands
of Douglas fir, hemlock and cedar. These trees are invaluable to the
industry for making high-grade beams, doors, moldings and telephone
poles.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government has shielded about 21 million acres of the 24
million acres of federal forest land in the Pacific Northwest from
logging--including 7.4 million acres set aside as old-growth reserves.
But at least 440,000 acres of classic old growth, and another 600,000
acres of younger but still "mature" forest, are within areas scheduled
for logging over the next few years under the Northwest Forest Plan
brokered by then-President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Most of this land is in the Umpqua National Forest in and around
Douglas County, as well as the Mount Hood, Willamette, Rogue River and
Siskyou national forests of Oregon and Washington's Gifford Pinchot
National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   In California, about 10% of the Sierra Nevada forests are old growth;
some stands also remain along the state's northern coast. Much of that
land is scheduled for logging in coming years.</TE>
<TE>   Conservation groups say that with all but 10% of the historic Western
rain forest already gone, it is important to save what is left.</TE>
<TE>   "This is America," said Mitch Friedman of the Northwest Ecosystem
Alliance, one of 13 groups that have launched a campaign to win
congressional support for an end to logging on public old-growth forests.
"We don't hunt whales. We don't spray DDT. And we shouldn't log old
growth."</TE>
<TE>   A panel of Northwest economists recently joined a group of
environmental scientists in calling for old-growth protection, pointing
out that tourism and other recreational use is playing an increasing role
in the regional economy. Logging on federal lands already has declined to
just 7.5% of all logging in western Oregon and Washington, they noted,
and only 3.9% of logs processed from 1990 to 1996 were more than 100
years old.</TE>
<TE>   "While elements of this transformation were forced on the industry, it
nonetheless resulted in a fundamental restructuring," the economic
analysis said. "The employment, income and price impacts of protecting
our remaining old forests are likely to be very small in percentage
terms."</TE>
<TE>   Timber industry leaders admit that some public opinion is leaning
toward old-growth protection, but they contend few people want all
federal forest land locked up. Most, they say, would support a balanced
approach that allows logging for fire protection, disease control and as
a renewable source of lumber.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the public probably wasn't asked the right questions," Tom
Partin, president of the American Forest Resource Council in Portland,
Ore., said of the recent polling. "They should have been asked, 'Do you
know how much of the national forests are already set aside? Do you
understand . . . over 50% of the national forests are at high risk due to
fires because of the overcrowding?' I think if the questions were
addressed in the right context, you'd probably get a different response."</TE>
<TE>   The poll conducted by the independent firm of David, Hibbits &amp; McCaig
included 600 registered voters in Washington and Oregon. It asked if they
would support protection of old-growth forests on public land from
logging, as well as at what age forests should be considered old growth.
Overall, 70% said they strongly supported or somewhat supported
protection, while 25% opposed it.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Robertson, a Douglas County commissioner, conceded that the
conservation message has made inroads, even in a region that once called
itself the timber capital of the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the course of the last 12 to 15 years, the environmental
community has done a very good job of engaging the public on an emotional
basis relative to old-growth forests, without telling the complete story
in terms of management . . . that the buildup of fuel on the forest floor
has resulted in the destruction of old-growth forests by fire," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you want to protect old growth? Do you want to protect the harp
seal? Do you want to protect the whales? Well, sure. But it needs to be
looked at in a lot of depth, and people seldom do."</TE>
<TE>   The old-growth protection campaign has been controversial, even in the
environmental community. Some conservationists fear that legislation
being drafted by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) will protect old growth at the
expense of logging on other forests.</TE>
<TE>   "We really need to stop logging on national forests [entirely]. Just
protecting the old growth isn't enough," said Chad Hanson of the John
Muir Project.</TE>
<TE>   Wyden emphasized that any legislation would have to include "a
substantial and appropriate thinning program" to manage other forests
against fire and disease.</TE>
<TE>   In Douglas County, 70% of the timber that feeds the mills now comes
from outside the county. Court restrictions have halted most old-growth
logging here.</TE>
<TE>   "We can design forestry to produce old trees on a very regular basis,"
said Jerry Keck, resource manager for D.R. Johnson Lumber Co. "People
forget that trees grow. We cut them because it's a renewable resource."</TE>
<TE>   The Umpqua River valley east of Roseburg is blanketed with private
tree plantations, giving way to the majestic old-growth stands of the
Umpqua National Forest. The Diamond Lake district high in the hills,
where Boise a few years ago completed a major logging project, is
pockmarked with clear cuts.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent flight up the valley, James Johnston of the Cascadia
Wildlands Project pointed down to the jagged, multicolored hues of old
growth standing among the homogenous stretches of logged and replanted
forest.</TE>
<TE>   Boise has pledged not to log any old-growth trees in stands of 5,000
acres or greater. But very little of the old growth left in this valley
is in tracts that large, Johnston said.</TE>
<TE>   "The only kind of old-growth that's going to be protected [by the
company's recent decision] is the kind . . . that doesn't exist anymore,"
he said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's difficult to find much cause for optimism in a meeting that
praises the intifada just days after a Palestinian bomber slaughtered a
room full of Israelis celebrating Passover. But such is the state of the
Middle East that the Arab League summit in Beirut last week still
qualifies as a glimmer of light.</LD>
<LD>   Despite its dreary praise of the Palestinian war against Israeli
civilians, the league took a historic step, on paper at least, by
offering peace for land: "normal relations" between the Arab world and
Israel in return for an Israeli withdrawal from all territory occupied
since 1967 and the creation of a Palestinian state. True, the initiative
remains so deficient of detail that the State Department refused to
categorize it as a plan or a proposal; it was, said the department's
spokesman, only "a vision of peace." It's far from clear that the Arab
nations are even committed to pursuing it.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the Bush administration understandably wants to support this
potential opening, one of the only positive developments amid the daily
carnage. "Behind the [Arab League] statement, there is a lot that needs
to be defined," said one senior administration official. "But it is
something we absolutely want to move forward."</LD>
<TE>   The question now is how to breathe more life into this pale ember.
President Bush will spotlight the idea this month as he hosts its
architect, Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, at his ranch in Crawford, Texas.
But as the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians spirals toward
absolute catastrophe--touching a lower circle of hell almost every
week--the United States may need to offer something more tangible than
diplomatic exhortation.</TE>
<TE>   To encourage the Arab nations to begin genuine discussions with
Israel--and sincere efforts to restrain the Palestinians--it may be time
for the administration to advance a vision of its own. The deal for the
Arab world would be straightforward: A new political relationship with
Israel could bring a new economic relationship with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   It's an idea long overdue. Economic stagnation isn't the principal
cause of the Arab world's difficulties, or of its widespread hostility
toward America and Israel. But economic failure compounds all of the
region's other problems. For a generation, while other developing nations
have raced forward, the Arab nations have been stuck in the sand. In the
1950s, per capita income in Egypt was comparable to South Korea's; today
it's less than one-fifth as high, according to a recent Council on
Foreign Relations study. Over the next decade, the study projects, the
Arab states aren't expected to grow fast enough to reduce unemployment
rates that reach a debilitating 20% in some countries and infect all of
these societies with discontent.</TE>
<TE>   The Arab states have many economic problems. Many are too dependent on
oil. Almost all suffer from the refusal to trade with Israel, the
region's most dynamic and modern economy. School attendance is low,
illiteracy is high.</TE>
<TE>   But a significant part of the problem is that, except for the trade in
oil, the Arab nations have isolated themselves from the world economy.
Across the Arab world, trade barriers are among the world's highest.
Tariffs on imports commonly exceed 20%, notes Edward Gresser, director of
the project on trade at the centrist Progressive Policy Institute. Most
Arab countries also impose crippling restrictions on international
investment.</TE>
<TE>   The result has been to shut off the Arab world from trade and
investment that could create jobs, expand opportunity and relieve
despair. Twenty years ago, the Middle East accounted for 13% of world
exports. Now it's down to less than 3%. Meanwhile, says Gresser, "all the
Arab countries, plus Pakistan and Iran and Afghanistan, have received
less foreign investment since 1985 than Singapore alone."</TE>
<TE>   As part of this self-isolation, the Arab nations' economic ties with
the U.S. have also withered. Excepting Israel, the Middle East today
accounts for only about 2% of American trade. After Saudi Arabia, the
U.S. takes in more exports from Iraq (under the U.N. oil-for-food
program) than any other Arab country.</TE>
<TE>   Thus the opportunity for the U.S. to offer a swap of its own, linking
trade and peace. In a compelling recent paper, Gresser proposed a
visionary bargain for the Arab world: In return for support in the war on
terrorism, progress toward economic and legal reform at home, and
renunciation of the Israeli boycott, the U.S. would offer duty-free
access to the American market for agricultural products and light
manufacturing goods, many of which we now limit with heavy tariffs. It
would be easy, Gresser notes, to add to that list of conditions the
establishment of "normal relations" with Israel, as the Arab League
proposed last week.</TE>
<TE>   The experience in Jordan suggests how much the Arab nations could gain
from such expanded access to the American market. In 1997, the U.S.
agreed to eliminate duties on products manufactured in seven Jordanian
industrial parks funded partly with Israeli investment; that program
alone has created about 25,000 jobs, mostly manufacturing products such
as clothes and luggage. In 2001, Jordan followed up by completing a
comprehensive free trade agreement with the U.S. The result: Jordan is
now the fastest-growing exporter to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   New jobs in Jordan may seem a weak lever from which to pursue peace
between Israel and the Palestinians. Yet at this bleak moment--when Ariel
Sharon and Yasser Arafat seem incapable of transcending the grim logic of
war--one of the prerequisites for progress is to increase the number of
players with a stake in achieving peace. The lure of increased trade,
though surely no guarantee of success, might well encourage the Arab
countries to put more weight behind the words they endorsed in Beirut.</TE>
<TE>   But while dangling that carrot, it may be equally important for Bush
to signal that a failure to advance the Beirut initiative will have
consequences, too. All signs inside Israel suggest that if the violence
continues and Sharon falls, an even more hawkish government would likely
succeed him. The Arab world would then be looking desperately to the
United States to restrain Israel. But if the Arab nations don't show they
are serious about peace today, some in the White House believe Bush may
be less inclined tomorrow to discourage Israel from trying to restore its
security through war.</TE>

<LD>An America West flight was diverted to Wichita and grounded
overnight because of "suspicious wire" on a bathroom floor that officials
later learned came off a toilet paper holder, an airport spokeswoman
said.</LD>
<LD>   The plane was heading from Washington to Phoenix on Saturday when an
air marshal found the wire in the bathroom underneath an opened
compartment that holds carbon dioxide, spokeswoman Latricia Harper said.</LD>
<LD>   The flight was diverted to Wichita Mid-Continent Airport and its 130
passengers were evacuated, Harper said.</LD>

<HD>Son Charged in Judge's Beating</HD>
<DH>Attack: New Hampshire justice underwent surgery for severe head and
face injuries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CONCORD, N.H.
</DL>
<LD>The brutal attack on a justice on the New Hampshire Supreme Court
occurred in his bedroom in the middle of the night, and he said he could
not recognize his assailant. But on Sunday, police arrested the justice's
son.</LD>
<LD>   The beating of Justice John Broderick caused such extensive injuries
to his face that a top state official could not recognize him.</LD>
<LD>   Broderick, 54, was listed in serious but stable condition Sunday, a
day after he underwent surgery to repair broken bones and cuts on his
face and head.</LD>
<TE>   Early Sunday, police arrested John Christian Broderick, 30, and
charged him with assault.</TE>
<TE>   "The strength and compassion of our friends and our faith will sustain
us through this tragedy," the family said in a statement Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The younger Broderick had been living at his parents' condo and police
found him there when they responded to a 911 call from his mother at 2:20
a.m. Saturday, Assistant Atty. Gen. William Delker said.</TE>
<TE>   He was released from a Manchester hospital Sunday and sent to the
Hillsborough County Jail, where he was being held on $100,000 bail.
Delker would not comment on why he was hospitalized or if he had a
lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Delker also said he couldn't comment on what might have prompted the
attack.</TE>
<TE>   In October 2000, Broderick was charged with slapping his son,
according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   Broderick blamed the altercation on his son's drinking. John Christian
Broderick had been living with his parents for two months.</TE>
<TE>   Delker said it appeared that Broderick was asleep when he was
attacked, and he told investigators he did not see his attacker.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. Philip McLaughlin said the injuries were so severe that he
could not recognize the judge.</TE>

<HD>Undefeated Johannesburg Limited to One Prep Race</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: The leading Kentucky Derby contender will run
in England Saturday, then train in the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In England, it's nigh impossible to upstage the Grand National
steeplechase, a race first run in 1839, but Saturday a track not far
from London and a beer sponsor from Australia will try to do just
that. Lingfield Park is running the Foster's International Trial
Stakes, a race that has been created to prepare the undefeated
Johannesburg to run in the Kentucky Derby on May 4.</LD>
<LD>   Johannesburg, having already won major stakes in Ireland, France
and England, came to the U.S. last fall and won the Breeders' Cup
Juvenile at Belmont Park for his seventh consecutive victory. That
was enough for Eclipse Award voters to elect Johannesburg the best
2-year-old male to race in North America in 2001, but the
Irish-based, Kentucky-bred colt hasn't run since.</LD>
<LD>   Aidan O'Brien, the 32-year-old trainer who has dominated Irish
racing for almost a decade, plans to run Johannesburg in the one-mile
race at Lingfield, then bring him to Kentucky and train him up to the
Derby.</LD>
<TE>   Bold Venture ran only once as a 3-year-old before he won the Derby
in 1936, but more recent winners have had at least three or four prep
races in the years they've won the race. The last Derby winner with
fewer than three preps as a 3-year-old was Sunny's Halo, who used a
two-race foundation to win at Churchill Downs in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Besides bucking that Derby tradition, O'Brien has chosen a curious
place for Johannesburg's only pre-Churchill race. Johannesburg's only
dirt race has been in the Breeders' Cup, and Lingfield's layout is
neither grass nor true dirt--it's an all-weather, Polytrack surface
that is not similar to what's waiting for the colt in Louisville.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no kickback at Lingfield, and horses have trouble coming
from behind to win there," said Richard Duggan, a California
bloodstock agent who bought Hanuman Highway off a win at Lingfield in
1997 and then watched him finish seventh in the 1998 Kentucky Derby.
"Johannesburg won't experience the kickback of dirt in his face from
other horses, so I don't see how this race will help him at
Churchill, where he's bound to get a lot of dirt in his face. Maybe
they think the horse got enough experience with dirt in the Breeders'
Cup."</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien used the Lingfield track to prepare Johannesburg, Galileo
and Giant's Causeway for Breeders' Cup dirt races. Giant's Causeway
lost by a neck to Tiznow in the 2000 Breeders' Cup Classic at
Churchill and Galileo was sixth in last year's Classic.</TE>
<TE>   Johannesburg already has worked over the Lingfield course this
year.</TE>
<TE>   "The rumors I hear is that the horse is not doing that
particularly well," Duggan said. "Now I know there are a lot of
rumors around the racetrack, but this is what I heard when I was
trying to buy some horses over there recently. And where there's a
lot of smoke, there just might be some fire."</TE>
<TE>   One of Johannesburg's owners is Michael Tabor, a native Londoner
who lives in Monte Carlo. Tabor won the Kentucky Derby with Thunder
Gulch in 1995. Besides Johannesburg, Tabor has two and perhaps even
three Derby prospects this year: Mayakovsky, winner of the Gotham at
Aqueduct on March 17, is expected to be the second betting choice,
behind Came Home, in Saturday's Santa Anita Derby; Nokoma, a
disappointing seventh in the Florida Derby, will get another chance
in the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct on April 13; and Castle Gandolfo, a
stablemate of Johannesburg's, is also scheduled to run at Lingfield
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Biancone, who trains Mayakovsky, said Sunday that Pat
Valenzuela will ride the colt in the Santa Anita Derby. Edgar Prado,
who has ridden the colt in all three of his races, has a commitment
Saturday to ride Bowman's Band in the Oaklawn Handicap in Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   Valenzuela was 17 when he won the 1980 Santa Anita Derby with
Codex, and he won the race again in 1989 with Sunday Silence, who
went on to win the Kentucky Derby. In and out of drug rehabilitation
in recent years, Valenzuela hasn't ridden in the Santa Anita Derby
since 1994, but he won a race for Biancone Sunday and with 27 winners
ranks sixth in the meet standings.</TE>
<TE>   "I see him as a force at rest," Biancone said. "I mean to say,
since he has come back, he's riding like he's 22 years old again.
He's like a rookie with experience."</TE>

<LD>Even though the Lakers dominated Portland, 91-79, Friday night at
Staples Center, Ruben Patterson of the Trail Blazers remains
unimpressed by the defending NBA champions.</LD>
<LD>   "We should have won the game," he told the Portland Oregonian. "We
can beat the Lakers. I would rather meet them in the first round.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not scared of them. They are not that good. We had the game
in our hand. We let it go."</LD>
<TE>   Question is: Who is Patterson trying to convince?</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Nevada Las Vegas scored an NCAA championship
game-record 103 points in defeating Duke in 1990. What was the
previous record?</TE>
<TE>   Why not own 'em all? Norman Chad writing for America Online: "If
Philip Anschutz can't win the MLS cup, it's not for lack of effort.</TE>
<TE>   "Major League Soccer--the stepchild of American pro sports--is
back smaller than ever, but Anschutz is larger than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "The Denver billionaire collects soccer players like mantelpieces
collect dust. In the new and contracted 10-team MLS, Anschutz owns
half the teams and has a half-interest in a sixth."</TE>
<TE>   Still sharp: Peter Vecsey in the New York Post commenting on Chick
Hearn:</TE>
<TE>   "No offense to the fabled one, but Paul Sunderland's pregame
dialogue with Phil Jackson, in-depth preparation and quick wit will
be greatly missed. Still, Hearn sounded especially impertinent prior
to the Lakers restricting the Blazers to 79 points.</TE>
<TE>   "He told a Fox interviewer, 'The Laker defense is in need of more
rehab than I do.'</TE>
<TE>   "Thanked for his time, Hearn wryly replied, 'Where's my gift?'"</TE>
<TE>   More Vecsey: "Before we go any further, let's see if I understand
the latest ESPN bulletin: If Michael Jordan finds he can't play on
one leg next season he'll retire. But if both legs are fairly
functional he will play.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm confused. Does that mean, if I'm not breathing next season,
I'm dead? And if I am breathing, I'm alive? OK, I think I got the
picture."</TE>
<TE>   Makes sense: Cincinnati Red center fielder Ken Griffey Jr.: "Last
year I was hurt and we were losing. But I kept hearing, 'Junior
doesn't smile anymore.'</TE>
<TE>   "Who smiles all the time when they're hurt and losing?"</TE>
<TE>   FYI: When Utah Jazz guard John Stocktonturned 40 on Tuesday, Leon
Wood was among three referees for Utah's game against Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Wood, who turned 40 a day earlier, was selected 10th in the 1984
draft; Stockton was 16th.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1985, Villanova upset Georgetown,
66-64, to win the NCAA men's basketball championship in Lexington,
Ky.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats made 79% of their shots from the field (22 of 28).</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: UCLA defeated Duke, 98-83, in 1964 in winning its
first NCAA championship.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Ira Winderman in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel: "The
next expenditure for Maverick owner Mark Cuban might be a locker-room
valet. Last week, Dallas guard Nick Van Exel pulled a muscle in his
rib cage while putting on a shirt.</TE>
<TE>   "Before a Maverick-Wizard game Dec. 8, Dirk Nowitzki sprained his
ankle while putting on a shoe."</TE>

<LD>Tidbits, put-backs and tip-ins from the Final Four while wondering
who sheds more tears this time of year, Kansas Coach Roy Williams or
actress Halle Berry.</LD>
<LD>   News item: Maryland favored in tonight's national title game
against Indiana.</LD>
<LD>   Second thought: These cliches just in, hot off the presses from
Sunday's news conferences:</LD>
<TE>   Maryland's Lonny Baxter: "Tomorrow we're just going to come out
and give it our best shot. Everybody is going to play hard."</TE>
<TE>   Indiana's Tom Coverdale: "We've got a lot of people jumping on the
bandwagon these days that didn't believe this from Day One."</TE>
<TE>   Indiana's Jarrad Odle: "You know, when it comes down to it,
everybody puts the uniform on the same way."</TE>
<TE>   Quote of the day: "You know."</TE>
<TE>   Three things you'll be sick of hearing by halftime of tonight's
CBS telecast: 1) References to these Hoosiers and the movie
"Hoosiers," 2) Announcers talking about how much "heart" Indiana has
shown, 3) "There's another timeout on the court."</TE>
<TE>   Does Indiana really have a chance?</TE>
<TE>   Well, of course. You can stuff all this gutty-little-underdog
talk. Last time we checked, Indiana was 5-0 in national title games
and recently knocked off the school, Duke, that has been the
flashback in Maryland's recurring Final Four nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Player matchups are the key in tonight's game.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: You bet they are, Billy Packer. Indiana's Dane
Fife vs. Maryland's Juan Dixon is the best matchup involving guards
since "The Longest Yard." The last two guys Fife defended, Kent
State's Trevor Huffman and Oklahoma's Hollis Price, made a combined
three of 18 shots. Dixon has been, by far, the most valuable player
of the tournament and is coming off a 33-point game against Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon on going against Fife: "I'm not worried at all, man. I'm
just going to go out and play my game. I'm not talking trash, but
that's just the type of person I am."</TE>
<TE>   The other matchup to watch is Maryland power forward Chris Wilcox
against Indiana star Jared Jeffries. Wilcox is an NBA player in
waiting, a 6-foot-10 kid who is equal parts sprung steel and
springboard.</TE>
<TE>   The lanky Jeffries is a relative willow in the wind.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a frail team," Jeffries concedes. "That's a given."</TE>
<TE>   News item: Indiana Coach Mike Davis seeks to impress bosses and
pad bank account.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: You have to admire the guy's honesty. Asked what
winning the national title would mean to him, Davis said: "Well, I
hope I get a raise."</TE>
<TE>   News item: Indiana stuns Oklahoma in NCAA national semifinal game.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: No joke, these were the "breaking news" sports
headlines on the Internet site for the Avalanche-Journal in Lubbock,
the new hometown paper of Bob Knight: "Sabres 3, Flyers 1." "Nets
102, 76ers 92." "UConn Set to Be Part of History."</TE>
<TE>   The paper's sports site did devote appropriate coverage to
Indiana's upset win, although we hear Knight offered the editors a
few headline suggestions:</TE>
<TE>   "Heartbreaking Oklahoma Loss Doesn't Dampen Knight's Book Tour"</TE>
<TE>   "Maryland Advances to Title Game; Will Face Big Ten School"</TE>
<TE>   "Talent-Laden Indiana Nearly Loses to Plucky Oklahoma"</TE>
<TE>   "Team Myles Brand's Mother Could Coach Defeats Hapless Sooners"</TE>
<TE>   "Knight's 'Fab Five' Recruiting Class Overcomes Coaching
Obstacles"</TE>
<TE>   News item: Downtown Atlanta church makes plea for new pipe organ.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: You might call it a "Hardcourt Homily." At the end
of Easter services at Sacred Heart Catholic Church, a female
parishioner made a collections plea to help raise money for a new
pipe organ. "If you're a Maryland or Indiana fan, we'll say a prayer
for you," the woman said. "If you're a Kansas or Oklahoma fan, we'll
say a prayer for a good recruiting class."</TE>
<TE>   News item: Indiana advances to title game as No. 5-seeded team out
of the South Regional.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: You think maybe No. 4 USC ought to be kicking
itself?</TE>
<TE>   News item: Indiana players irked former coach has not called to
congratulate them.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Jeffries said the thing that hurts most is Knight
said he was recruiting "a person, not a basketball player."</TE>
<TE>   As for Knight's legacy, Jeffries said: "We've already separated
from his legacy. People have got to realize that there's nothing that
ties this team with Coach Knight. Every one of us had the option to
leave, and no one did. The Coach Knight era was good, but this is a
new era."</TE>
<TE>   No hard feelings, huh?</TE>
<TE>   News item: Davis thrives on national stage.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: He didn't take any direct shots at Knight, but his
digs were not-so-subtle.</TE>
<TE>   Davis on coaching kids: "I have a 16-year-old son. I don't want
people trying to intimidate him. I mean, I get on my guys a lot, and
they know my personality. But I want my players to like me. I just
feel like if they like you, they'll play hard for you."</TE>
<TE>   Davis was an assistant under Knight, yet says his mentors are
former Alabama coaches Wimp Sanderson and C.M. Newton.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Newton is a gentleman," said Davis, who played for both
coaches. "You know, he taught me that you can do it without being
embarrassing."</TE>
<TE>   News item: Indiana players use other long-shot stories as
motivation.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Kyle Hornsby often watches videotapes his dad made
of Villanova's upset over Georgetown in 1985. The Hoosier players
have also brushed up on Buster Douglas' win over Mike Tyson; "just
some improbable victories," Hornsby said, "people that the media did
not give a chance."</TE>
<TE>   FYI: The inspirational tape loop did not include former "Partridge
Family" bass player Danny Bonaduce's recent boxing win over "Brady

<HD>2 Guantanamo Prisoners Force Fed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MIAMI
</DL>
<LD>Two prisoners who refused food for 30 days to protest their
detention at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were force fed
through stomach tubes Sunday, the military said.</LD>
<LD>   The two are among 300 suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners
captured in Afghanistan and held at the U.S. military base in eastern
Cuba.</LD>
<LD>   Military doctors inserted tubes through the men's noses and down into
their stomachs, feeding them a "milkshake-like" nutritional substance
used for comatose patients and other involuntary feeding, military
spokesmen said.</LD>
<TE>   "The detainees said they were refusing to eat because they wanted to
go home, and not eating provided a means for them to protest their
detention," the military said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The two were moved last week from the prison to a mobile hospital,
where they accepted intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration but still
refused food.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors and the camp's Muslim chaplain had tried unsuccessfully to
persuade them to eat. After the two prisoners refused meals for 30 days,
medical personnel resorted to force feeding because of concerns about
weight loss and overall health.</TE>
<TE>   "It went very smoothly and without incident," said Capt. Al Shimkus,
the surgeon in charge of the mobile hospital.</TE>
<TE>   He said the treatment was expected to continue for at least seven
days, after which "natural hunger pangs usually return, which helps
encourage an individual to eat on his own."</TE>
<TE>   In February, nearly 200 of the Guantanamo prisoners refused at least
some meals in a "rolling" hunger strike that began when a guard removed a
turban from a praying prisoner.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the other prisoners were eating well. Maj. James Bell, prison
task force spokesman, said they had gained an average of 10 pounds each
since arriving.</TE>

<HD>Rangers Decide to Give Rivera a Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It didn't take long for Ruben Rivera to get another chance to play in
the majors.</LD>
<LD>   Rivera, who lost his job with the New York Yankees after stealing
Derek Jeter's glove and bat, signed a minor league contract with the
Texas Rangers on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Rivera was released March 11 by the Yankees after stealing the
equipment from the locker of his teammate and selling them to a
memorabilia dealer.</LD>
<TE>   The Rangers brought Rivera to their minor league camp in Florida
on March 24 with intentions of giving him a 10-day tryout. It took
only a week before the Rangers decided to sign him.</TE>
<TE>   Club spokesman John Blake said Rivera, 28, will start the season
with Tulsa, Texas' affiliate in the double-A Texas League.</TE>
<TE>   "The report from our people is they like what they had seen on the
field and off the field," Ranger General Manager John Hart said. "We
have talked to him and have support people who will be in place to
work with him daily in Tulsa."</TE>
<TE>   Once one of the most promising prospects in baseball, Rivera has
spent parts of five seasons in the major leagues with the Yankees,
San Diego and Cincinnati. In 562 games, he has a batting average of
.218 with 58 home runs and 185 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Baltimore Orioles put left fielder Marty Cordova, who has a
strained right quadriceps, on the 15-day disabled list. The move was
made retroactive to March 28, a day after he sustained the injury
during a spring training game. He is eligible to rejoin the active
roster on April 12.</TE>

<LD>If major league owners insist upon eliminating two teams after the
season, the Montreal Expos will be one. If Minnesota lawmakers enact
proposed legislation to finance a new stadium, that would remove the
Twins from the endangered list and force owners to find another
contraction partner for the Expos.</LD>
<LD>   With Commissioner Bud Selig reluctant to eliminate a team whose
owner wants to remain in the sport, Disney's willingness to sell the
Angels has prompted speculation that the company might accept a hefty
payment from major league owners--say, $250 million--and disband the
team. Paul Pressler, the Disney executive who oversees the Angels,
says the company would not volunteer the team for contraction.</LD>
<LD>   "The Angels have never been discussed for contraction," Pressler
said. "It's not something we would be in favor of."</LD>
<TE>   Disney would be willing to sell the Angels to the owner of a team
targeted for contraction. When owners targeted the Expos and Twins
for contraction last winter, Selig tried to broker a deal in which
Montreal owner Jeffrey Loria would buy the Florida Marlins and
Florida owner John Henry would buy the Angels. Loria did buy the
Marlins, but negotiations between Henry and Disney broke down, and
Henry then joined the group that won the bidding for the Boston Red
Sox.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Wooten, who underwent surgery last month to repair a damaged
joint in his right thumb, said Sunday he hopes to return long before
the All-Star break, the estimate originally provided by team
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going for early June," Wooten said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Lewis Yocum, the Angels' medical director, confirmed that
Wooten could return sooner if he heals quickly. He said the
rehabilitation period ranges from two to four months.</TE>
<TE>   As the Angels constructed their team last winter, they planned for
Wooten and Scott Spiezio to split time at first base. With Wooten
injured and Spiezio suspended, Benji Gil started at first base Sunday
and batted eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio started at first base and batted eighth on opening day
last year. In the first 40 years of franchise history, the opening
day first baseman never had batted below the seventh spot in the
lineup.</TE>
<TE>   With Spiezio suspended for five games, Manager Mike Scioscia said
Gil will play first base, backed up by Jose Nieves and, if necessary,
Darin Erstad. The Angels would not be inclined to play designated
hitter Brad Fullmer there because they might have to replace him for
defensive purposes and do not want to remove his bat from the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels sold out their opener by selling 10,000 tickets in the
three days before the game. The Angels said they sold slightly fewer
than 13,000 season tickets by opening day, down from more than 13,000
last year, but team executives said they hope the enthusiasm that
generated Sunday's sellout will also generate additional
season-ticket sales this month.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Indians will rely more on pitching this season,
and right-hander sets tone with shutout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The new-look Cleveland Indians are relying on pitching for a change,
anticipating a significant drop in run production after dropping
three of their most productive run-producers this winter.</LD>
<LD>   Cleveland booted outfielders Juan Gonzalez and Kenny Lofton and
second baseman Roberto Alomar in cost-cutting moves, opening holes in
a batting order that had been one of the American League's best. The
starting rotation is now the Indians' foundation, and even one crack
might lead to a collapse.</LD>
<LD>   But it could be a solid unit if the rest of the starters follow
the lead of Bartolo Colon, who tossed a five-hitter Sunday night in a
masterful 6-0 opening-night victory against the Angels before a
sellout crowd of 42,697 at Edison Field.</LD>
<TE>   Colon befuddled the Angels in the first game of the major leagues'
2002 season, making a strong opening statement for a retooled club
seeking positive reinforcement. The right-hander mixed 97-mph
fastballs with sharp changeups and curveballs, setting the tone the
Indians envisioned.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the kind of day we were all hoping for," said third
baseman Travis Fryman, who had two of Cleveland's 11 hits and the
game's only home run. "If you asked guys a month ago, I think they
would have scripted it out a lot like today. Bartolo did a great job
to get us started, which is exactly what we needed."</TE>
<TE>   The Indians underwent a budgetary-forced remodeling after
ownership instructed first-year General Manager Mark Shapiro to dump
payroll.</TE>
<TE>   Shapiro tightened the belt by not re-signing heart-of-the-order
slugger Gonzalez and Lofton, a catalytic leadoff batter. Alomar, a
future hall of famer, was traded to the New York Mets, trimming the
payroll from $93 million to $82 million.</TE>
<TE>   But at what cost?</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland ranked second in the AL last season in batting average,
runs and home runs. Gonzalez and Alomar combined for 240 runs batted
in, and Lofton ignited the engine. First baseman Jim Thome is
considered the only sure thing left in the lineup, and the Indians
acknowledge that their replacements can't be expected to keep pace
with the departed all-stars, so pitching must lead the way.</TE>
<TE>   "We did lose a lot of power and run production, so our pitching
staff is going to have to do exactly what Bartolo did," designated
hitter Ellis Burks said. "We know that's not going to happen every
game, but we need them to keep us close.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to hit a lot of home runs but we're going to
single and double you to death. If all our pitchers can keep us in
games like Bartolo did, it's going to be a fun season."</TE>
<TE>   Getting started was the key, new right fielder Matt Lawton said.</TE>
<TE>   "Setting a good tone is very important because that's what we're
going to have to get to win as many games as this club won last
year," said Lawton, who arrived from the Mets in the Alomar trade.
"It's going to be hard to duplicate what Mr. Colon did tonight, but
we've got to get good pitching to get it done."</TE>
<TE>   Colon, 26, set the bar high as the curtain was raised on the
regular season in a 98-pitch, 66-strike performance. He believes
Cleveland starters C.C. Sabathia, Chuck Finley, Danys Baez and Ryan
Drese will follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   "Being [the] No. 1 [starter] today, the way I pitched, I think
that's going to boost the other guys in the rotation," Colon said
through an interpreter. "They watched the way I pitched, and they'll
have an idea on how to attack hitters."</TE>
<TE>   The Indians are counting on it.</TE>

<LD>The Clippers have lost four of their last five games and, although
it's difficult to figure out precisely what's wrong, they do realize
they haven't been at their best recently. Have they simply run out of
gas?</LD>
<LD>   "We haven't been in sync the last couple of games," Jeff McInnis
said after the Clippers' 105-92 loss Saturday to the Utah Jazz.</LD>
<LD>   Even in their lone victory during this stretch the Clippers had to
rally from an 18-point deficit in the second quarter Friday to defeat
the Phoenix Suns on McInnis' jump shot at the buzzer.</LD>
<TE>   "It should be good pressure," Coach Alvin Gentry said of playing
meaningful games late in the season. "I don't know if our guys sense
the pressure or the urgency. I think they understand how we have to
approach these games, though."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers desperately needed victories Saturday and Wednesday
against the Jazz to narrow the gap in the fight for the eighth and
final playoff spot in the Western Conference. The Clippers are 41/2
games behind the Jazz with eight games to play.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Utah is looking ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still trying to catch Seattle and we have a long, hard,
uphill struggle to do that," Utah guard John Stockton said of chasing
the seventh-place SuperSonics. "So that's been my focus, looking at
who we can catch, rather than looking behind at who's chasing us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One of the keys to Utah's victory Saturday was that when McInnis
and Stockton each picked up his fifth foul in the fourth quarter,
McInnis went to the bench and Stockton stayed on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   McInnis would return, only to foul out with 1:24 to play. Stockton
never came close to drawing his sixth foul. He scored eight of his 16
points in the fourth quarter.</TE>

<LD>Lowlights from an 0-3-1 trip:</LD>
<LD>   * The Kings, who have converted 20.4% of their power-play
opportunities and killed 87.2% of their penalties, were successful
with the man-advantage only 10.5% of the time on their swing through
Phoenix, Vancouver, Edmonton and Calgary, and killed only 73.1% of
their penalties.</LD>
<LD>   * After giving up more than two power-play goals only once in
their first 72 games, they surrendered three each against the
Vancouver Canucks and Calgary Flames.</LD>
<TE>   * They were outscored, 15-5.</TE>
<TE>   * They failed to earn points in three of the four games after
establishing themselves as one of the best road teams in the league
by garnering points in all but one of their previous 11 road games
and 14 of their previous 16.</TE>
<TE>   * They returned home with only a three-point lead in the race for
the final Western Conference playoff slot, after leaving with a
seven-point cushion.</TE>
<TE>   "We came up with one point out of a possible eight," defenseman
Mattias Norstrom said.</TE>
<TE>   "Really disappointing for this time of the year, but I think it's
important for us as a team, with seven games left, not to hang our
heads and start to think too much about what happened.</TE>
<TE>   "We know what we're capable of--we did it not too long ago, we see
it in spurts--so the most important thing right now is to shake off
these few games and just grab the bull by the horns with the
challenge we've got at home now."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings play two of their last seven games against the
ninth-place Canucks, Tuesday night at Staples Center and April 11 at
Vancouver. Also remaining are home games against the Detroit Red
Wings, Edmonton Oilers, Dallas Stars and Mighty Ducks. Their final
road game is April 13 at San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   "I know how hard we've worked to put ourselves in a position to be
in the playoffs and I fully expect that we'll finish strong," Coach
Andy Murray said. "But there are no guarantees in this business."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Aaron Miller and winger Kelly Buchberger gave the Kings
some good news Sunday, reporting that they felt better after
suffering injuries that forced them out of Saturday night's 5-3 loss
at Calgary.</TE>
<TE>   Murray listed them as probable for Tuesday's game.</TE>
<TE>   "If they show as much improvement tonight as they did just in the
last 24 hours," Murray said Sunday night, "that's a good sign."</TE>
<TE>   Miller left Saturday's game after suffering a right rib strain
when hit from behind late in the first period. Buchberger suffered a
bruised right thigh when he blocked a shot in the game's final
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   They'll be reevaluated today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eric Belanger, who Murray said would possibly be sidelined until
the playoffs because of a slow recovery from wrist surgery, will
practice with the team this morning, the coach said.... The Kings'
four-game winless streak is their longest since the last week of
December, when they went 0-2-2.</TE>

<HD>Fisher Won't Knuckle Under</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The first knuckle on Derek Fisher's right forefinger is sore and
swollen, but not broken, according to X-rays taken after Sunday's
game.</LD>
<LD>   An hour after he scored five of the last seven Laker points in
their 96-95 victory against San Antonio, the left-handed-shooting
Fisher said he did not expect the injury to hinder him.</LD>
<LD>   "Once it's warmed up and everything's flowing, I really don't feel
it much," Fisher said.</LD>
<TE>   He suffered the injury March 22, when Detroit's Ben Wallace
smacked him with his elbow. In five games since, Fisher had avoided
hard contact on his hand until the first quarter Sunday. Since the
Detroit game, Fisher has made 20 of 50 field-goal attempts, seven of
20 three-pointers, including a critical one against the Spurs with
2:19 left that brought the Lakers to within 95-92.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning always makes you feel better," Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Losers by 12 points Friday night, the Portland Trail Blazers left
unconvinced of the Lakers' superiority. Ruben Patterson claimed the
Lakers aren't that good on the way out of town, and Steve Kerr
concurred Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I felt more comfortable after the game," he told the
Portland Oregonian. "To me, last year the Lakers looked unbeatable.
Now they look a little more vulnerable. They are still by far the
best team and the team to beat, but [Shaquille O'Neal] doesn't quite
look right. He looks like he is banged up a bit.</TE>
<TE>   "Saying that, he puts 34 [points] on us, which shows how good he
is. But you can just tell defensively he definitely is not the same
and maybe that will pick up in the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The big sodas at Staples Center come with payment books, so when
the nice-looking family behind the Laker bench lost two of them in a
pregame loose-ball incident, no one felt worse than Mark Madsen.</TE>
<TE>   It was Madsen who gave chase to the ball that banged off the rim,
bounded off the top of Phil Jackson's game chair and short-hopped two
Buckets-o-Cola. The contents flooded the family's shoes and pooled
into the aisle.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh gee, I'm so sorry," Madsen said. "I'm really sorry."</TE>
<TE>   He reached over the bench and shook hands with the family members,
a look of utter regret across his face.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could buy you a couple," he said, tugging at the sides
of his pocket-less shorts. "But I can't. I don't have any money on me
right now."</TE>
<TE>   They smiled at his apology, worth the price of the drinks. Maybe.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Barring an injury or a drastic change in philosophy, Mitch
Richmond appears to have played his last important minutes for the
Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday was his fifth DNP--CD in six games, his only playing time
in that period has been 12 minutes in what started as a blowout
against Cleveland. Jackson said he spoke to Richmond about staying
involved, in case there is a change.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers sold out their playoff tickets in about 90 minutes
Saturday. A combined 17,000 tickets were available for up to 15
games.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Picks Coach</HD>
<DH>College basketball: School will hire Reynolds, who built
power at Cal State San Bernardino.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Larry Reynolds, who in five years turned Cal State San Bernardino
into a Division II power, will be named coach at Long Beach State
today.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Janisch, Long Beach media relations director, said a news
conference is scheduled for today at the Pyramid. Janisch did not
disclose the details of the news conference but it is expected that
Reynolds, 48, will be introduced as the 15th coach in 49er history.</LD>
<LD>   Reynolds was unavailable for comment Sunday night. A source said
he was returning from Atlanta, where he was attending the Final Four.
Metro State (Colo.) Coach Mike Dunlap, who was the other leading
candidate, said on Sunday that he removed his name from
consideration.</LD>
<TE>   It will be Reynolds' first job in Division I. In recent years, he
has been a candidate for openings at Cal State Fullerton, Loyola
Marymount and St. Mary's. He succeeds Wayne Morgan, who resigned
after compiling a 91-84 record in six seasons. Reynolds fits the mold
of what Long Beach Athletic Director Bill Shumard said he was looking
for: a candidate who had at least four years of head-coaching
experience with the ability to recruit Southern California. Reynolds
has extensive ties to the Southland, playing at UC Riverside when it
was a Division II program and later spending 16 years as an assistant
to Coach John Masi. He also was an assistant at San Francisco in
1995-96.</TE>
<TE>   In five seasons at San Bernardino, Reynolds was 110-35 with three
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. championships. In his last four
seasons, the Coyotes averaged nearly 25 victories. This season, San
Bernardino was a program-best 28-2 and reached the Elite Eight,
losing to eventual champion Metro State.</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds follows a recent pattern of highly successful Division II
coaches who have joined the Big West Conference. UC Irvine Coach Pat
Douglass came from Cal State Bakersfield and UC Santa Barbara Coach
Bob Williams came from UC Davis. Both won national championships at
that level.</TE>

<HD>Webber Gets Last Word in Atlanta</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Helping Sacramento end a 12-game losing streak at Atlanta pleased
Chris Webber for several reasons.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings, with the best record in the NBA, defeated the Hawks,
92-91, Sunday to remain ahead of the Lakers and Dallas Mavericks as
they battle for home-court advantage in the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   And Webber's 29 points and 12 rebounds let him have the last word
with Atlanta assistant coach Rick Mahorn.</LD>
<TE>   "Rick Mahorn is a person that I feel is responsible for getting me
into the NBA," Webber said. "I met him in high school. It's a
pleasure to beat him every time because he likes to talk trash. At
halftime, he said, 'You guys are going to win the championship, but
you're going to lose today.'"</TE>
<TE>   Webber, who contested the Hawks' last two shots and played the
entire second half, helped the Kings get their first victory at
Atlanta since Feb. 16, 1988. Overall, Sacramento has won four in a
row and 11 of 13.</TE>
<TE>   Ending March with a 12-4 record, the Kings improved to 7-1 in
their last eight road games.</TE>
<TE>   "We know this is a tough place for us to play," Webber said. "We
love Atlanta. We spend a lot of time here in the summer, so I guess
our focus isn't that good. Today we wanted to make sure we paid
attention to detail, and they played well."</TE>
<TE>   The Hawks had the ball with 8.9 seconds left, but Jason Terry
missed a running jump shot off the glass and Nazr Mohammed's
eight-foot shot from the right side bounced off the rim at the
buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 100, Miami 81--The Pacers, holding the eighth and final
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, stayed 11/2 game ahead of
Toronto. Miami fell four games behind the Pacers, who also gained the
tiebreaker edge over the Heat.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Artest had 24 points, nine rebounds and eight steals to lead
the Pacers.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 72, Philadelphia 70--With Vince Carter out for the rest of
the season, the Raptors are finding ways to win and keep their
playoff hopes alive.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Davis scored 16 points, including a go-ahead tip with 44.8
seconds left at Philadelphia, as the Raptors won their fifth
consecutive game without Carter.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto remained 11/2 games behind Indiana for the eighth and
final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia fell to 2-11 without Allen Iverson, who is expected
to be sidelined the remainder of the regular season because of a
broken left hand.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 86, Denver 82--The Pistons clinched a playoff spot as
Jerry Stackhouse scored 22 points, including four in the final 30
seconds at Auburn Hills, Mich. The Pistons, who finished 32-50 last
season, moved within 21/2 games of New Jersey for the top spot in the
Eastern Conference. They lead Milwaukee and Charlotte by 51/2 games
in the Central Division and are on pace to have first-round
home-court advantage for the first time since 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 86, New Jersey 85--Kevin Garnett had 23 points and 22
rebounds at Minneapolis as the Timberwolves held on for their third
victory in a row. The Nets, who trailed by as many as 21 points in
the first half, outscored the Timberwolves, 23-9, in the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 110, Washington 103--Steve Nash made two long jump shots
and a three-point play in the final three minutes at Washington to
help the Mavericks send the Wizards 21/2 games behind Indiana for the
final Eastern Conference playoff spot. He scored 19 of his 22 points
in the second half and had 10 of the Mavericks' final 14 points.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jordan missed his first seven shots and didn't score until
he made two free throws in the final minute of the third quarter. He
then made three consecutive field goals but missed his last two shots
in the game's final two minutes. He finished with 10 points and five
assists in 28 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 110, Milwaukee 80--The Celtics (42-32) clinched their first
winning record in nine seasons with the victory at Boston, handing
the Bucks their 11th loss in 16 games and beating them for the first
time in four meetings this season.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 97, New York 90--Tracy McGrady had 31 points, nine
rebounds and seven assists for the Magic, which went on a game-ending
10-3 run at Orlando. The Magic (40-33) improved to seven games over
.500, a level it has achieved only one other time this season.</TE>

<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Indiana Coach Mike Davis stayed true to form and kept his promise by
not holding an organized practice Sunday. Davis, a religious man, has
a policy against practicing on Sundays and wasn't about to change on
Easter, despite his Hoosiers being one day away from playing for the
national championship in a Davis, er, David and Goliath matchup.</LD>
<LD>   But that didn't mean the Hoosier players weren't shooting around
on their own on the Georgia Dome court.</LD>
<LD>   "Coach understands he's got guys willing to work for him," Hoosier
senior guard Dane Fife said. "He doesn't need to tell us to come in
and shoot.</LD>
<TE>   "If anybody doesn't, we're going to drag their butts out of bed at
the hotel and get them in here."</TE>
<TE>   Maryland needed no such dragging</TE>
<TE>   "I just worry about what we do," Terrapin Coach Gary Williams
said. "We'll do some things. I was going to go [practice] three hours
but our seniors talked me out of it so we'll just walk through some
things ... really have a good mental practice.</TE>
<TE>   "But each coach has to do what's best for his team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Davis has acknowledged that Maryland assistant Dave Dickerson gave
him some pointers on how to defeat Duke in the South Regional
semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Was it safe, then, to assume that Davis, with his tongue planted
firmly in cheek, had called Dickerson for tips before facing his
Terrapins?</TE>
<TE>   "I called him last night and he wouldn't return my call," Davis
joked.</TE>
<TE>   The next time Williams defeats Indiana will be the first time. The
Maryland coach, who has had previous stops at American, Boston
College and Ohio State, is 0-7 lifetime against the Hoosiers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's bogus," Williams said of his winless streak against Indiana.
"I went to Ohio State, we were rebuilding and Indiana won the
national championship. They didn't just beat us when I was there;
they were beating everybody.</TE>
<TE>   "We lost on a last-second shot when we were at B.C. ... I believe
four of those games were at Indiana, which is always a nice place to
play."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Gutierrez</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Williams considers senior starters Juan Dixon, Lonny Baxter, Steve
Blake and Byron Mouton the best in Maryland history.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at this senior class, they are the best because of
what they've accomplished," he said. "They stayed four years to enjoy
college and play against good competition."</TE>
<TE>   Players who turn pro early often miss out on playing for a team
that wins 31 of 35 games, as Maryland has.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to win and they enjoyed the winning," Williams said.
"You go pro early and you never know if you get a chance to win like
that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even though the teams haven't met this season, Fife has heard
plenty about Maryland. The father of his former roommate is a
Maryland graduate.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in my face, the dad and the kid," Fife said. "It's all in
good fun, we just talk a little trash."</TE>

<KH>Tonight's Final</KH>
<HD>KEYS TO THE GAME</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>STYLE OF PLAY: Indiana, which is shooting 52.9% from three-point
territory in the tournament, is feared primarily for its proficiency
from beyond the arc, so in the NCAA semifinals Oklahoma spread the
floor on defense against the Hoosiers in an attempt to thwart their
perimeter game. Indiana responded by pounding the ball into the paint
and beating the more physical Sooners at their own game down low
while getting their big men in foul trouble. Then the Hoosiers went
to work from the outside. Expect Indiana to try the same formula
tonight, though Maryland insists it is not taking the less-athletic
Hoosiers for granted after out-running and out-gunning Kansas, the
nation's leading scoring team. The Terrapins maintain that they are
as comfortable in transition as they are in half-court sets.</LD>
<TE>   MATCHUP TO WATCH: Juan Dixon vs. Dane Fife. Dixon lit up Kansas
for 33 points in the second NCAA semifinal after Fife had badgered
Oklahoma's top scorer, Hollis Price, into a dreadful one-of-11
shooting performance. The pesky Fife, who has earned a reputation as
a stopper with his in-your-jersey defense, has no illusions about
containing the Dixon by himself. "This is definitely going to be the
toughest challenge of our careers," Fife said. "It's not going to
take one of us, but ... all five of us as a team to win. I don't know
how we're going to do that yet." Dixon said he looks forward to the
test. "Being a marked man is nothing new to me," he said. "I'm not
worried at all. I'm just going to go out there and play my game. I'm
not talking trash, but that's just the type of person I am. I have a
lot of confidence in my ability."</TE>
<TE>   INTANGIBLES: Indiana, a popular pick to lose its first-round game
to Utah, is riding a wave of Hoosier Hysteria unknown in these parts
for at least a decade. The Hoosiers, who can become only the fourth
team to win a national title with at least 10 losses, are relishing
the underdog role. Maryland, with its three senior starters and top
seven scorers returning from last year's Final Four team, relies
heavily on experience. The Terrapins learned much from blowing a
22-point lead to Duke in the 2001 national semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   MAGIC NUMBERS: Indiana, only the second No. 5-seeded team to reach
the championship game, has won its last 31 games when scoring more
than 75 points. The Hoosiers are also 16-2 this season when they make
at least 14 free throws in a game and are 15-3 when they make seven
or more three-point shots. The Terrapins, meanwhile, are 30-0 when
they shoot a higher percentage than their opponents and are 27-2 when
they shoot more free throws. Maryland is 20-2 when it outrebounds an
opponent.</TE>
<TE>   FINAL ANALYSIS: Maryland should handle Indiana. Then again, Duke
and Oklahoma should have too. The unheralded Hoosiers' cover has been
blown, and they won't sneak up on the Terrapins tonight as they
attempt to lull Maryland into a false sense of security. Indiana's
best chance at winning its first title since 1987 is to replicate the
game plan it ran to perfection against the Sooners--get Maryland's
big men in foul trouble while unleashing multiple screens for its
shooters to pick the Terrapins apart from the outside. The difference
is, Maryland has too many weapons and is much deeper than either Duke
or Oklahoma. After a tight first half, the Terrapins should cruise in
the last five or so minutes ... unless Indiana makes 15 three-point
shots, as it did against Kent State, and Maryland's starting
frontcourt fouls out.</TE>

<HD>Schumacher Wins With His 'Perfect' New Ferrari</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Schumacher won the Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix Sunday at
Sao Paulo in his new Ferrari, edging younger brother Ralf by less
than a second.</LD>
<LD>   Schumacher, the four-time world champion, was in front from the
start in the debut of his F2002 car and lost the lead only twice.</LD>
<LD>   "The car was perfect," he said. "We had no problems, but it was a
very tight race with Ralf."</LD>
<TE>   Michael Schumacher completed 71 laps on the 2.677-mile Interlagos
circuit in 1 hour 31 minutes 43.663 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Already on his victory lap, Schumacher might have been forgiven
for not realizing he had won. Pele was supposed to wave the checkered
flag, but the Brazilian soccer great apparently missed both
Schumachers crossing the finish.</TE>
<TE>   He finally waved the flag as David Coulthard went past the line.</TE>
<TE>   "I was confident I could win, and winning in the new car makes us
optimistic for other races," Schumacher said. "I'm a lot more
optimistic for circuits where last year we traditionally struggled."</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher had a first-bend tussle with Juan Montoya, sending his
Williams-BMW into pit lane minus a front wing.</TE>
<TE>   Montoya started from the pole position and blocked Schumacher
heading into the corner, forcing the German to hit the brakes.</TE>
<TE>   "Juan Pablo behaved really well," Schumacher said. "He left enough
space for both of us and I thought I could outbrake him in the first
corner, but I couldn't."</TE>
<TE>   The only times Schumacher did not hold the lead were when he was
overtaken by teammate Rubens Barrichello and when he stopped in the
pits, putting his brother in front. Ferrari took back the lead after
the pit stop by Ralf, who was driving a Williams-BMW.</TE>
<TE>   Coulthard, in a McLaren-Mercedes, finished third. Jenson Button,
in a Renault, was fourth and Montoya came back from 20th place for
fifth. Mika Salo, driving a Toyota, finished sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher extended his lead in the driver standings to 24 points,
eight ahead of his brother. Montoya is third with 14.</TE>
<TE>   Cycling</TE>
<TE>   Lance Armstrong finished in second place in the Criterium
International at Charleville-Mezieres, France, trailing winner
Alberto Martinez of Spain by one second.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong, the three-time Tour de France champion, was third
fastest in the 5.3-mile time trial, moving from ninth to second
overall.</TE>
<TE>   "I was missing something, but I'm happy," Armstrong said. "This
time last year my form wasn't like this. The legs aren't bad."</TE>
<TE>   The Criterium, a minor stage race, was the Texan's first event in
France this season. It is the only French race in which Armstrong is
expected to compete before the July 6-28 Tour de France.</TE>
<TE>   College Baseball</TE>
<TE>   Eastern Connecticut's Bill Holowaty became the 34th baseball coach
in NCAA history to reach 1,000 victories as the Warriors swept a
doubleheader from Massachusetts Boston, 14-3 and 5-3.</TE>
<TE>   The wins gave Holowaty a 1,000-378 record in 34 seasons at the
school. He's the fourth Division III coach to reach the milestone.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Jocelyn Thibault made it clear Sunday that he's the Chicago
Blackhawks' No. 1 goaltender.</LD>
<LD>   Starting for the first time since March 20, Thibault stopped 18
shots as the Blackhawks defeated the Minnesota Wild, 2-1.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been a while since I won a game, so it feels great,"
Thibault said. "The guys played a real solid game in front of me. I
feel like we are rolling again."</LD>
<TE>   Thibault (31-21-9) has played in 63 of the team's 75 games, but
had gone 1-5-2 since the Olympic break while backup Steve Passmore
started and won three straight games.</TE>
<TE>   "Joce was sharp," Chicago Coach Brian Sutter said. "He was very
good. Steve's played very well, and I've said all along we are going
to need them both."</TE>
<TE>   Tony Amonte scored his 350th goal and assisted on Alex Zhamnov's
goal in the first period to provide all the scoring Chicago needed to
defeat the Wild.</TE>

<HD>A Change for the Better Comes to Dana Hills</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Zeke Barragan desperately needed a spark heading into his third
season as coach of the long-beleaguered Dana Point Dana Hills High
baseball program.</LD>
<LD>   Barragan would have taken a timely hit, a strong pitching
performance, a defensive gem--anything to ignite a team that had an
all-time winning percentage of .462 and was 6-38-1 in South Coast
League play over the previous three years.</LD>
<LD>   His Dolphins have responded with nothing less than a firestorm.</LD>
<TE>   The team is hitting .336, has a collective earned-run average of
2.53 and is vying for its first league title since 1991. Dana Hills
(9-3, 3-2), No. 18 in The Times' regional rankings, is tied with
three other teams atop the South Coast League, but the Dolphins have
the best overall record.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think we would have jumped out to the start we jumped
out to," Barragan said. "After last year, I would have considered
.500 a big improvement. To have taken nine out of 12--we're a little
surprised."</TE>
<TE>   The Dolphins opened the season strongly in the Loara tournament.
Senior Tony Davidson threw a one-hitter against Villa Park in the
semifinals, allowing Dana Hills to advance to the championship game
against Lakewood. The Dolphins lost but made a big impression in
their 30th varsity season.</TE>
<TE>   Leading the way have been Brent Lawson, a junior center fielder
who, according to Barragan, "came out of nowhere" to hit .452 with a
.549 on-base percentage; Jeff Kaplan, a junior right fielder leading
the team with five home runs and 17 RBIs; and Davidson, 3-1 with a
1.12 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Cooper, a senior shortstop hitting .389, said the older
players simply became sick of losing.</TE>
<TE>   "One of our mottos is, 'You've got to hate to lose,'" Cooper said.
Barragan said the difference is also attributable to a renewed work
ethic. After the Dolphins finished 2001 with a 7-18-1 record, they
started to come together during a Memorial Day tournament. Players
routinely took extra grounders and batting practice.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since then you could just feel a different attitude,"
Barragan said. "They're great kids and they're not afraid to work.
That has been the biggest difference."</TE>
<TE>   Dana Hills can continue its strong start Tuesday when it plays
Antioch in the West Coast Classic in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   The Dolphins could face Huntington Beach Edison, No. 4 in The
Times' rankings and the defending tournament champion, in the second
round.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a long way to go," Barragan said. "In all honesty, to
make the playoffs after last year would be a huge step for the
program."</TE>
<TE>   Always a Classic: La Puente Bishop Amat, ranked No. 7 nationally
by Baseball America and No. 2 in Southern California by The Times,
begins defense of its 2001 National Classic title at 5 p.m. today
when it plays Livermore Granada at Cal State Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   The 16-team tournament includes participants from five states. The
six Southland teams are Bishop Amat, No. 5 Westminster La Quinta, No.
9 Lakewood, No. 10 West Hills Chaminade, No. 14 Placentia El Dorado
and Anaheim Esperanza. Chaminade is also ranked No. 15 by Baseball
America.</TE>
<TE>   Games will be played today through Thursday at El Dorado High,
Esperanza High, Champions Sports Complex in Placentia and Cal State
Fullerton. Semifinal games will be played at 5 and 7 p.m. Wednesday
at Cal State Fullerton, with the championship at 7 p.m. Thursday at
Cal State Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Comebackers: Scott Scharlach, a senior right-hander, pitched a
one-hitter with 12 strikeouts and no walks for Pasadena Poly in a 1-0
nonleague victory over Sierra Madre Maranatha. The only baserunner
Scharlach allowed was on a bunt single with two out in the third
inning. Scharlach retired 13 consecutive batters to end the game....</TE>
<TE>   La Puente Nogales Coach John Romano recorded his 400th career
victory after pitcher Brandon Mozley struck out seven in six strong
innings during a 4-1 win over Rowland Heights Rowland. After opening
his career with a one-season stint at Yucca Valley, Romano has spent
the last 24 years at Nogales.</TE>

<HD>Taft Brings Back That '80s Show</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Walter Kearns rekindled the golf team at Taft High in 2000, he
had one thing in mind: to build a winner.</LD>
<LD>   It appears his plan is working.</LD>
<LD>   Taft, a perennial City title contender for several decades before
the school cut the program in 1994 because of budget constraints, was
11-0 and won the City 4-A League last season.</LD>
<TE>   This year, Taft moved into the more competitive 6-A League and is
2-2 despite having two of its top players academically ineligible.
"We've had a lot of fun with it," Kearns said. "This year, we're
probably not going to win a city championship, but we're competitive.
It'll take a few years to attract the good players, but we like to
think we are building a winning program."</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly what Taft was doing in the 1980s, when PGA Tour
player Duffy Waldorf played there, led the Toreadors to three City
championships and helped build a tradition. When money problems
saddled the L.A. Unified School district in the '90s, schools cut
back on athletic programs and golf at Taft was a victim.</TE>
<TE>   Kearns, 79, a retired surgeon and an accomplished amateur golfer
who had three sons graduate from Taft, volunteered to run the program
at no cost to the school. The administration had no problem with his
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, I was just looking for something to do," said Kearns,
who qualified for the 1989 U.S. Senior Amateur championship and shot
his age more than 50 times last year. "It seems that the interest in
the program is growing, but golf is a difficult sport to learn. It
takes time to start from scratch."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There is no official state championship in high school golf, and
while discussion is underway to have one, the Atascadero tournament
on Tuesday may have to do for now.</TE>
<TE>   The 44-team tournament at Chalk Mountain Golf Course in Atascadero
includes five teams from The Times' Southern California top 10 and
some of the best teams from the Central Section and Northern
California.</TE>
<TE>   San Marcos, Palm Springs, Santa Margarita, and Westlake have all
won CIF-SCGA titles in the last seven years and will all be at the
tournament. Coaches have raved about the organization and quality of
competition at the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "We love going up there," Westlake Coach Dave Costley said. "It's
one of the better tournaments I've ever gone to."</TE>
<TE>   The tournament format is combined score from three players.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the best fields I've seen," Atascadero Coach Sam
DeRose said. "We get a lot of local support from the community and it
shows in the quality of the tournament. That's why teams like to come
up here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Wilson is on the verge of posting a good score, but may
have to wait until next week to do it. That's when daylight savings
time will be in effect.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the Bruins' last three matches have been cut short by
darkness. They were one-over as a team through 14 holes against Long
Beach Millikan and were four over through 14 against Lakewood.</TE>
<TE>   "We're starting to come alive," Wilson Coach Jim Ferguson said.
"We usually do when we start playing 18 holes."</TE>

<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>College sports can be filled with ugliness and jealousy, with
cheating and no more attention paid to academics than a wink and a
nod. ESPN did a big piece on gambling and college sports to welcome
us to this Final Four weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Sad.</LD>
<LD>   And so was seeing how Bob Knight has refused to acknowledge the
immense and wonderful accomplishment of the underdog Hoosier men, the
players who had come to Bloomington, Ind., because Knight had asked
them and who had stuck up for him when he was at his worst. Thanks,
Bob, for erasing any good feelings about what you had done at and for
Indiana University.</LD>
<TE>   But then Oklahoma and Connecticut ran onto the court at the
Alamodome Sunday night for the NCAA women's final and 29,619 people
stood and cheered. The Sooners and the Huskies are teams filled with
seniors who had built things, good things, amazing things, worthwhile
things. Seniors who probably will all receive college degrees.</TE>
<TE>   The seniors from Oklahoma built a program where there wasn't one
and will be remembered in Norman for their determination and
exhilaration and for being the first Big 12 team at a women's Final
Four and for being the only team this season to scare Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   And the Sooners did scare Connecticut. Don't doubt that.</TE>
<TE>   The seniors at Connecticut were building perfection, constructing
history, advancing on toward their destiny. The Huskies finished a
39-0 season by winning the national championship game over Oklahoma,
82-70. Think that's easy? No matter how good you are, when everybody
expects you to win by 30 every night, that's pressure.</TE>
<TE>   The pressure showed. Sue Bird, one of the seniors, the player of
the year, the best point guard going, couldn't stand still, even at
the solemn part when she was holding the tattered World Trade Center
flag and trying to sing the national anthem and then she couldn't
slow down enough to shoot well.</TE>
<TE>   Bird and the other three Connecticut seniors--Swin Cash, Asjha
Jones and Tamika Williams--had gone to Storrs because they wanted to
be like the 1995 Connecticut team, the one with Rebecca Lobo and
Jennifer Rizzotti that went 35-0 and won a national title. Some goal,
perfection. Some achievement.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't believe history or the undefeated part," Williams said,
"until I am 35 or 36 years old and my kids are 7 or 8. I'll tell them
I played with some of the greatest players, and it was the best thing
that ever happened to me.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want this to be an easy game. I wanted to make it a
game. I am sure everyone enjoyed it."</TE>
<TE>   The game was not beautiful, but it was emotional and played at a
frenetic pace. Connecticut had 21 turnovers. For the first time this
season, the Huskies didn't make a three-point shot. With three
minutes to go, Connecticut led by only six points. It was close
because the Sooners had five seniors who would not quit making plays.</TE>
<TE>   Stacey Dales, the star, had come from Canada, a skinny thing with
a great first step and the need to be part of the foundation of
something. She didn't want to add to a legend. She wanted to make
one. LaNeishea Caufield, so quiet she needs to be poked in the side
to speak up, came from little Ada, Okla., even though she had been a
budding star when the state university almost dropped the program.</TE>
<TE>   Rosalind Ross has played on a right knee braced tight because it
pretty much has no ligament left. Jamie Talbert signed on because no
one else much asked. Shannon Selmon decided to join them because her
father, Dewey, and her two uncles played football at Oklahoma and if
you're a Selmon athlete you go to Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Dales couldn't stop crying after the game. She wanted to tell us
what it felt like to be part of the first Oklahoma women's basketball
team in a national championship game. But she couldn't. It was too
hard.</TE>
<TE>   Dales pointed at Coach Sherri Coale and choked out, "For me,
Coach--she's pretty awesome ... I'm upset that I'm going to have to
leave these guys and Coach because she's taught me a lot about
basketball and more about life."</TE>
<TE>   Life for these seniors will not be filled with millions of dollars
earned from basketball. Bird and Dales will play in the WNBA, but not
for millions. Some of these seniors might coach someday, but not for
millions.</TE>
<TE>   All of them will celebrate this moment, though, the winners and
the losers.</TE>
<TE>   Bird, Williams, Jones and Cash dove into a pile and howled
collectively. This, of all their 39 victories, was, in its way, most
impressive. They had withstood the pressure, imposed on themselves
and by Oklahoma. They fought in a physical, grinding game and gave
better than they took. They shot 52.6% from the field and
outrebounded Oklahoma, 44-25.</TE>
<TE>   An hour after the game, Dales had dried her tears and was snapping
a photo of the scoreboard. She is wise. What happened to her was not
a loss but a victorious journey and she will, in a day or a week or a
month, take away only the good.</TE>
<TE>   And so should the rest of us. A college sport that filled a dome
for a weekend was not all about the money or the agents or the egos.
It was about the seniors who walked out together, from Oklahoma and
Connecticut, ready for the future and well prepared for it.</TE>

<LD>Only when Andre Agassi's body is donated to science some five or six
decades from now will we know exactly where he keeps the reserve tank
that pumps that defiant body of his into overdrive.</LD>
<LD>   With his legs growing heavy and his two-set lead nearly dissolved,
the 31-year-old tennis icon with the powerful will and boundless
energy went to his finishing kick Sunday to subdue Roger Federer,
6-3, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, and win the Nasdaq-100 Open--the fifth time he
has won the Key Biscayne title since this event began 18 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   "I had another gear and I knew I needed to shift to it," said
Agassi, who had slipped into a slow fade from the moment his gifted,
20-year-old Swiss opponent found his serve at the beginning of the
third set.</LD>
<TE>   From that point until he served at 4-3 in the fourth, Federer had
won 33 of 41 service points and this well-played championship match
seemed headed for a fifth set, where Agassi's chances would not have
looked good.</TE>
<TE>   But the seven-time Grand Slam winner, who has played the best
tennis of his career the last four seasons, would not be subdued by
attrition.</TE>
<TE>   He received one monumental piece of good fortune when Federer
double-faulted on a point that would have put him ahead, 5-3.</TE>
<TE>   Then he broke back with a desperate forehand return that landed
one inch inside the baseline. Given only one slender opening, Agassi
flashed to the finish line to claim the $456,000 winner's check and
yet another crystal trophy.</TE>
<TE>   The match was full of great shot-making and the drama that makes a
final memorable.</TE>
<TE>   For Federer, there was disappointment. "I really felt I could go
to a fifth set. But then, suddenly, he picked it up and I didn't
serve well anymore. Suddenly," Federer said resignedly, "the whole
thing was over."</TE>
<TE>   For Agassi, it was his 51st career title and 13th Masters Series
event crown, and he spoke in detail about why he has been a dominant
figure here.</TE>
<TE>   "The courts are medium paced. You can hit through it or work the
point. It's windy out there, which is good for my game. I have
relatively short swings and I can make little adjustments, high or
low," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a number of elements that lend for me to play
well here, but still, to win you always have to get a little bit
lucky."</TE>
<TE>   The luck was there in the telltale eighth game of the fourth set
when Federer double-faulted. He had been hitting a kick second serve
all afternoon when he decided, "Just take a chance."</TE>
<TE>   The match began well for Federer, who broke serve in the second
game. But Agassi broke right back and again went ahead, 4-3, when
Federer decided to slug an inside-out forehand down the line instead
of crosscourt. His shot went into the net.</TE>
<TE>   After not being broken in 40 games in the tournament, Federer now
had twice seen his serve busted.</TE>
<TE>   In the second set, Federer's usually lethal backhand lost
effectiveness. He committed 11 unforced errors off that side and
Agassi easily took the set.</TE>
<TE>   The last time they had played was in the fourth round at the U.S.
Open in 2001, where Agassi won easily, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   By the third set, Agassi was having problems generating speed off
Federer's soft shots and that, combined with Federer's great serving,
seemed to turn the match around.</TE>
<TE>   Until Agassi punched the magic button that activates the extra
tank, as he has done so many times before. And as he will no doubt do
again.</TE>

<LD>The rest of the women's college basketball world will be relieved
that this incarnation of Connecticut played its last game Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   But Coach Geno Auriemma isn't looking at next season as a
rebuilding year.</LD>
<LD>   "All these seniors, they're laughing because they know somebody is
going to pay for all the stuff they've been doing," Auriemma said.
"So I don't think anybody is going to feel sorry for us.</LD>
<TE>   "And I wouldn't exactly call [next season] starting over. We have
four really good players coming in. I think Jessica Moore, Ashley
Battle, Maria Conlon and Ashley Valley will contribute a lot. And I
think we have the best player in America as a junior next year, Diana
Taurasi.''</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut became the first women's program with more than one
undefeated championship season. The Huskies were 35-0 when they won
the title in 1995. UCLA has the most undefeated title seasons by a
men's team with four.</TE>
<TE>   The Final Four semifinals and championship game both had
attendance totals of 29,619, which established new NCAA records. The
previous high was 23,291 at the 1996 Final Four in Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   With a new contract with ESPN taking effect, next season's Final
Four semifinals will be played Sunday, April 6, at the Georgia Dome.
The championship will be Tuesday, April 8--the night after the men's
final.</TE>

<HD>Being Home Free Not Always a Good Thing</HD>

<LD>This is why home-court advantage matters. It's not always about
comfort or crowd noise. Sometimes a game, a series or even a
championship comes down to the sound or the silence of a whistle--and
at that moment location can mean everything.</LD>
<LD>   The site happened to be the eastern side of Staples Center on
Sunday. One time down the court, the whistle blew and Derek Fisher
got a trip to the free-throw line for the deciding points in the
Lakers' 96-95 victory over the San Antonio Spurs.</LD>
<LD>   The next time play came to that end, the officials ruled that
Shaquille O'Neal got his hand on Tim Duncan's shot and nothing else.
Duncan's jumper fell well short and the Lakers had their 11th
consecutive victory at Staples--and another day of contention for the
best record in the league and home-court advantage throughout the
playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   The arena influences the referees in basketball more than any
other sport. At least, that's the perception.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a team respected by the officials, home court makes a
big difference," Laker forward Robert Horry said. You won't find one
player who disagrees.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the Lakers don't get those calls if 35,000 fans in the
Alamodome are ready to scream their displeasure. Perhaps a call in a
critical game at Arco Arena in Sacramento would go the other way. The
NBA schedule gave the Lakers the benefit Sunday. Anything they get in
the playoffs will have to be earned in these final three weeks of the
regular season.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers didn't need home court last year. They went 8-0 on the
road in the postseason, including two victories in San Antonio to
start the Western Conference finals. And the Lakers won't be
intimidated if they have to go on the road to begin a series this
year. They already have won at Sacramento and Dallas, their two
biggest rivals for the No. 1 seed in the West.</TE>
<TE>   Right now Sacramento (53-19) leads the Lakers (52-21) by two games
in the loss column. If the Lakers had lost Sunday they could have
gone ahead and booked rooms at the Sacramento Hyatt--while looking
over their shoulder at the Spurs. Now the Spurs (49-24) are a little
too far back, while the Lakers still have a shot at catching
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd just like to have [home-court advantage] for the first
round," Laker forward Rick Fox said. "Then after that ... it doesn't
scare me to go on the road the first two games. It's actually
slightly fun."</TE>
<TE>   It's not that the Lakers would be afraid of Sacramento. It's just
that Sacramento plays with so much more confidence at home--and the
Kings are great front-runners.</TE>
<TE>   As Fox said: "You're always braver in your backyard, because you
can always run in your house to your mom when you need her."</TE>
<TE>   Fox is big on this fear thing lately. He said Saturday that the
Spurs were "still scared" of the Lakers, and he didn't back off those
comments after Sunday's game.</TE>
<TE>   "You know you look in somebody's eyes and you can tell whether
they believe or not?" Fox said. "I think a lot was still lingering
from last year."</TE>
<TE>   Duncan's response: "Good for him. Basketball is not a sport where
you're scared of anybody. I'm not afraid of anybody on the court.
It's great that they won two championships and all that great stuff,
[but] why would you be afraid of somebody?"</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing fun and no empty rhetoric about having critical
calls go against you in the playoffs. Ask Phil Jackson if he still
thinks a foul should have been called on Chicago's Scottie Pippen
against Hubert Davis in Game 5 of a series against the New York
Knicks at Madison Square Garden eight years ago.</TE>
<TE>   That play was similar to Sunday's no-call. Contact after the play
on the ball. Replays indicated that O'Neal brushed Duncan's arm after
he blocked the shot with his fingertips. Only this time, no whistle.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a call I can't make," Duncan said.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll have to make your own call," Spur Coach Gregg Popovich
said. "The call wasn't made, the game's over. But you can make your
own conclusions."</TE>
<TE>   Here are mine: the players should decide the game, not the
referees, and this wasn't a blatant enough foul to demand a whistle.</TE>
<TE>   As Kobe Bryant said, "If that's a foul, I get fouled on every
shot."</TE>
<TE>   Here's O'Neal's view: "That was all ball. Even if I didn't get all
ball, they owe me that call. What about all the times when I get hit
on the arms? I didn't complain, not once today, on this beautiful
Easter."</TE>
<TE>   Would it be a foul if the game had been played in San Antonio?</TE>
<TE>   "Probably," O'Neal said. "It's kind of unfair sometimes, but it
doesn't matter.... That was good defense at the end. If they don't
like it, too bad."</TE>
<TE>   The other play the Spurs found difficult to swallow came after
Fisher rebounded a Duncan miss with 15.9 seconds left. Fisher fell,
Malik Rose was called for a foul and with the Spurs in the penalty,
Fisher went to the free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   Even Jackson thought it was curious.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if I've ever seen a finish where you get free throws
off a rebound foul," Jackson said. "But that was a big benefit to
us."</TE>
<TE>   Said Rose: "I didn't think I got him. But then when I saw the
replay I was really sure I didn't get him.</TE>
<TE>   "It probably is a home call. I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had their share of complaints--did Duncan foul Bryant
on a reverse layup in the final minute?--but they couldn't complain
too much. They shot nine free throws to San Antonio's two in the
fourth quarter, and both of San Antonio's free throws came from
technical fouls.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of disputed calls down the stretch," Jackson said. "But we
ended up coming away with this one."</TE>
<TE>   It's good to be home for the holidays.</TE>

<KH>BASEBALL 2002 OPENING DAY</KH>
<HD>An Angel Easter Egg</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Retooled team falls flat in debut, managing only
five hits in a 6-0 loss to Colon and the Indians before sellout crowd
of 42,697 at Edison Field.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All the excitement, all the anticipation and all the hype that
surrounded your new and improved Angels? Gone, in about 10 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels rolled a dud out there on opening day, a thoroughly
unsuspenseful 6-0 loss to the Cleveland Indians Sunday before a
sellout crowd of 42,697 at Edison Field and a national television
audience. The Indians scored four runs in the first inning, and
Cleveland ace Bartolo Colon was so dominant in his five-hit complete
game that there wasn't much else for the Angels to do the rest of the
evening except remind themselves that pennants are not lost with 161
games left to play.</LD>
<LD>   "You can't jump to conclusions off this game," Angel outfielder
Tim Salmon said.</LD>
<TE>   The Indians jumped to a lead so quickly that Angel pitching coach
Bud Black found himself visiting the mound before starter Jarrod
Washburn had gotten anyone out. This was fortunate for ESPN2, which
had put a microphone on Black for the game. This was not so fortunate
for the Angels, fired up after months of touting the blessings of the
additions of Kevin Appier, Aaron Sele and Brad Fullmer, the retention
of Darin Erstad and Troy Percival and the subtraction of Mo Vaughn.</TE>
<TE>   The first five batters of the game went walk, single, single,
single and single. The air rushed out of the proverbial balloon.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody was so excited and pumped up for the first game of the
season and, before we even have a chance to bat, we're down 4-0,"
Washburn said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all on me. I put us in a hole right away. It deflates a
team."</TE>
<TE>   It's not all on Washburn, but he did not help his cause by walking
the leadoff hitter, Matt Lawton. Omar Vizquel then cued a blooper
inside the right-field line, and Salmon came up throwing to second
base. Unfortunately for Washburn and the Angels, shortstop David
Eckstein positioned himself to cut off a throw to third, so Salmon's
throw sailed past the infield, untouched, for an error.</TE>
<TE>   Lawton scored on the error. Ellis Burks singled, and Jim Thome
flared a single into left field, scoring Vizquel for a 2-0 lead.
"Bloopers happen," Washburn said.</TE>
<TE>   Travis Fryman singled, loading the bases. Ricky Gutierrez grounded
into a third-to-home-to-first double play, and Washburn was one out
away from escaping with minimal damage. With an open base, and with
strikeout-prone Russell Branyan on deck, Washburn threw a 2-0
changeup to Milton Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley singled home two runs, the Indians led, 4-0, and Washburn
was kicking himself for throwing his third-best pitch to Bradley
instead of pitching around him.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't approach that very well, with Branyan coming up,"
Washburn said.</TE>
<TE>   Bloopers do indeed happen, and Washburn pitched pretty well after
the first inning. Angel catcher Bengie Molina said Washburn threw
better Sunday than he had all spring.</TE>
<TE>   And, although Washburn was making his first opening day start, no
one detected any jitters during that rocky first inning.</TE>
<TE>   "These things happen," Black said. "Everything gets magnified
because it's opening day."</TE>
<TE>   In that case, Colon ought to be a civic hero today in Cleveland, a
baseball-crazy town gripped by angst after the departures of Roberto
Alomar, Juan Gonzalez and Kenny Lofton. None of that matters if the
other team doesn't score, and Colon allowed only one runner to get as
far as third base.</TE>
<TE>   He walked one and struck out six. He threw about as many pitches
in nine innings as Washburn threw in five--98 for Colon, 91 for
Washburn--and he threw a 98-mph fastball in the ninth inning.</TE>
<TE>   "He was like Nolan Ryan out there," Salmon said. "He was doing
whatever he wanted."</TE>
<TE>   That included throwing breaking balls for strikes, which stunned
and befuddled Angel hitters who were busy failing to catch up to all
that heat.</TE>
<TE>   "He started out breaking out with other stuff," Salmon said. "That
surprised me."</TE>
<TE>   Said Cleveland Manager Jerry Manuel: "That's the way I imagine him
pitching--he used all of his pitches, mixed in some breaking balls,
threw fastballs on both sides of the plate. He was aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were deflated at first, and a bit disappointed after
the game, but they were not overly depressed.</TE>
<TE>   There wasn't much they could do about this one but offer a tip of
their collective cap to Colon.</TE>
<TE>   In six career starts at Edison Field, he is 4-0 with a 1.88
earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels will play another 161 games. They will not face Colon
in all of them.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately not," Salmon said, "or we'd all be out looking for
new jobs."</TE>

<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The setting was exactly what the Dodgers envisioned when they decided
to start left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii in their final exhibition game
against the Seattle Mariners.</LD>
<LD>   The result, however, was far from pretty.</LD>
<LD>   On a sun-splashed day before 13,679 at Safeco Field, the rookie
from Japan continued his spring training struggles in a 6-3 defeat.
Ishii gave up five runs, four hits, walked seven--including five
consecutive batters in the third--and hit a batter before he was
removed after 22/3 laborious innings.</LD>
<TE>   "I was glad it was not opening day and that it was an exhibition
game," Ishii said through an interpreter. "It gives me the
opportunity to find out what my problems are and fix those problems
as we enter the season."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers had hoped that Ishii, their No. 5 starter, would leave
behind the jitters that plagued him in Florida when he stepped onto
the mound at a major league stadium. But with more than 50 Japanese
media members on hand to chronicle the showdown between Ishii and
Mariner outfielder Ichiro Suzuki, Ishii rarely looked comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   Only 33 of his 82 pitches were strikes. He pitched from behind in
the count to 17 of the 20 batters he faced.</TE>
<TE>   "He has electric stuff but you have to get it over the plate,"
Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "You can't pitch
two-balls-and-no-strikes and succeed in the big leagues. That's a
free swing for a major league hitter."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii finished the spring with a 13.33 earned-run average in 81/3
innings against major league competition. Tracy said Ishii's
performance this spring was "something to be discussed," but would
not say whether Sunday's outing would have an impact on his status in
the rotation. Ishii is scheduled to pitch Saturday against the
Colorado Rockies at Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't answer that question," Tracy said. "Not today. That is a
rush to judgment."</TE>
<TE>   Suzuki had one hit and two walks in five plate appearances against
Ishii in Japan. But the reigning American League most valuable player
said he did not remember Ishii's style.</TE>
<TE>   "In my mind, it was just like facing any other pitcher," said
Suzuki, who laced a high 2-and-0 fastball down the right-field line
for a double in the first inning.</TE>
<TE>   In the second inning, Ishii retired the first two batters on fly
balls to left field before he hit No. 8 hitter Dan Wilson on the toe
with a pitch and walked Mark McLemore to bring up Suzuki. The first
pitch to Suzuki, a slider that was called a strike, sent him
sprawling. Suzuki got up, dusted himself off and lined the next pitch
into right field for a run-scoring single. Jeff Cirillo followed with
a run-scoring single to left field for a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Edgar Martinez led off the Mariner third with a single, but Ishii
got Mike Cameron to line out to first baseman Eric Karros and struck
out John Olerud. Once again, however, Ishii could not close out the
inning without damage.</TE>
<TE>   He walked Carlos Guillen on seven pitches, walked Jim Horner on
four consecutive balls, walked McLemore on five pitches to force in a
run and then walked Suzuki on four pitches to force in another. He
walked Cirillo on four pitches to give the Mariners a 5-0 lead and
was replaced by Terry Mulholland.</TE>
<TE>   It was not the first time that Ishii has struggled since signing a
four-year, $12.2-million contract in February. He has not appeared
comfortable on the mound in a game situation since March 8, when he
threw two scoreless innings in his debut.</TE>
<TE>   On March 16 against the Yankees, Ishii gave up six runs and six
hits, including three consecutive home runs, and was removed with two
out in the first inning. He did not pitch in a game again until last
Monday, when gave up a run and five hits in a four-inning game
against a team of New York Met triple-A players.</TE>
<TE>   Before Sunday's game, Dodger General Manager Dan Evans said he was
not overly concerned about Ishii's struggles.</TE>
<TE>   "People forget that last year at this time Ichiro was hitting
about .240 in spring training and all I kept hearing was, "Oh, he
can't pull balls. You can get him out pretty easily. He's not a very
good player,'" Evans said. "And on March 31 of last year he flipped
the switch and he was one of the finest players in the game from Day
One. So I'm not worried about [Ishii] at all."</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Evans said the Dodgers had purchased the contract
of left-handed reliever Jesse Orosco and designated outfielder McKay
Christensen for assignment.</TE>
<TE>   Orosco, 44, did not give up an earned run, struck out 12 and
surrendered only four hits in 12 innings this spring. Last season, he
was 0-1 with a 3.94 ERA in 35 appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Christensen, 26, could be traded or put on waivers during the next
10 days. He could be assigned to triple-A Las Vegas if he clears
waivers, a prospect Christensen said Saturday that he would not
welcome.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have today off and open the season Tuesday against the
San Francisco Giants at Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a complete off day--I don't want them around," Tracy said.
"Every person in every department [with the Dodgers] has worked
extremely hard since the 15th of February. I think the off day is
well-warranted."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers brought only 21 players to Sunday's game. Outfielder
Brian Jordan stayed in Los Angeles because of muscle soreness in his
right side.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want to take a chance," Tracy said. "With Tuesday being
as close as it is and with us being as healthy as we are we thought
it was best for him to stay [in Los Angeles]."</TE>
<TE>   Peter O'Malley, the Dodgers' president from 1970 to 1998, will
throw out the ceremonial first pitch Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Patti LaBelle will sing the national anthem.</TE>

<HD>Singh Ends His Long Drought</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vijay Singh didn't allow for much suspense in the final round of the
Shell Houston Open.</LD>
<LD>   Singh won his first PGA Tour title since the 2000 Masters, closing
with a four-under-par 68 Sunday for a six-stroke victory and
tournament-record 22-under 266 total on the TPC at The Woodlands in
Texas.</LD>
<LD>   He earned $720,000 for his 10th PGA Tour title.</LD>
<TE>   "It's been almost two years, I was wondering when the next one
would come," said Singh, who did win consecutive European tour events
last year in Asia. "It couldn't be at a better time, two weeks before
the Masters."</TE>
<TE>   A different player has won each of the last 14 events on the PGA
Tour, the longest such stretch since 1994 when the tour went 20
tournaments without a repeat champion.</TE>
<TE>   Darren Clarke shot a 71 to finish second at 272. Jose Maria
Olazabal was another stroke back after a 70. Jay Haas (69) and
Shigeki Murayama (70) followed at 275.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I wasn't going to worry about anybody but Darren; I played
really well and kept him at bay," Singh said.</TE>
<TE>   "I really didn't want to worry about him and [was able to]
concentrate on what I was doing. Darren really played well. It was
closer than it looked."</TE>
<TE>   Singh's 22-under total shattered the tournament record of 18 under
set by Curtis Strange in 1980 at Woodlands Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   Singh's six-stroke margin of victory matched the tournament record
set by Jackie Burke in 1952.</TE>
<TE>   Singh had played in 50 PGA Tour events without a victory.</TE>
<TE>   "You always get antsy when you don't win, it's just a matter of
how you handle it," Singh said.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, I got a little antsy and this year I decided to just
concentrate on playing. Today, I wanted to play a solid round and
that's what I did."</TE>
<TE>   Dave Eichelberger won his first Senior PGA Tour event in three
years when rain wiped out the final round of the Emerald Coast
Classic at Milton, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Eichelberger opened with consecutive five-under 65s for a two-
stroke victory over Doug Tewell, still two back after 10 holes when
the final round was called off.</TE>
<TE>   Lanny Wadkins was third, four strokes back at 134. Hubert Green
finished at 135.</TE>
<TE>   Eichelberger had his 12th career hole-in-one in the first round,
using a seven-iron on the 185-yard eighth hole. "That turned out to
be the difference," he said.</TE>

<HD>Foul Taste No Worry for Lakers</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: O'Neal makes late block on Duncan in 96-95
victory over Spurs, who beg for call from officials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the conclusion of eight days that asked them for quite a bit more,
a Sabbath-to-Sabbath pilgrimage that began in Sacramento and
concluded when Shaquille O'Neal redirected San Antonio's last shot,
the Lakers were uncertain of where it left them.</LD>
<LD>   And not curious, particularly.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers defeated the Spurs, 96-95, Sunday at Staples Center,
where they scored the last seven points--five by Derek Fisher, the
last two from the free-throw line with 15.9 seconds left.</LD>
<TE>   Tim Duncan's turnaround 12-footer with not quite six seconds
remaining was blocked by O'Neal, whose right hand came off the ball
and grazed Duncan's wrist. The clock wound down as Duncan slapped his
hands together, begging for a foul call, and as Kobe Bryant gathered
the ball as it fell several feet short of the rim.</TE>
<TE>   A week earlier, it was Chris Webber, on his knees, his fists on
the floor in Sacramento. Two days earlier, it was Scottie Pippen,
shaking his head, wondering where his shot went, and where it had
left the Portland Trail Blazers.</TE>
<TE>   And so Duncan demanded a judgment that would not come, mourned a
shot that did not fall, his eighth miss in nine fourth-quarter
attempts.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs surely called it robbery. The Lakers, one in particular,
thought it justice.</TE>
<TE>   "That's all ball," O'Neal said with playground attitude. "I was
getting beat on all day and I didn't make a face. I didn't say a
thing. If it was a foul, they owed me that. After 10 years of getting
beat up, of taking all that, they owed me."</TE>
<TE>   It is perfect logic to O'Neal, who got the ball, got the wrist,
got the victory, and got most of what he wanted from Sunday to
Sunday. The Lakers won emotional, hard games against the Kings, Trail
Blazers and Spurs--much of the core of the approaching Western
Conference playoffs--and stand two losses behind the Kings in the
Pacific Division.</TE>
<TE>   In winning their 11th in a row at Staples Center, the Lakers also
have won five of six games since they lost two in a row in Texas, the
second there by 18 points to the Spurs. That set up an Easter
afternoon with NBC in town and a national TV audience.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant scored 31 points, but needed 24 shots. He missed all
four fourth-quarter attempts, the last while being fouled without a
call under the basket by Duncan, which fit again into O'Neal's logic.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal scored 24 points. While he missed 11 of 19 shots, he made
eight of nine free throws. And Duncan scored 26 points, 16 in the
third, two in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Robert Horry who filled in between O'Neal and Bryant,
who defended Duncan as well as a power forward can and scored a
season-high 23 points, eight in a fourth quarter that saw the Lakers
make only five field goals. He had eight rebounds, a team-high four
assists, and two blocks.</TE>
<TE>   When the Spurs led by 10 early in the fourth quarter, Horry made a
three-pointer as Duncan rushed him from the lane. When the Spurs led
by seven three possessions later, Horry made another, again as Duncan
was trapped too deep.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to shoot it because I wanted to shoot it," said Horry,
rarely burdened by conscience in matters of offense. "I am going to
test my gun if it is firing right and keep shooting it. Tonight, I
hit a couple of them and helped pull the defense out."</TE>
<TE>   He held the Lakers close, and the Spurs, losers of three in a row,
did not score after Steve Smith's three-pointer gave them a 95-89
lead.</TE>
<TE>   From there, Fisher made a three-pointer from the right wing, Horry
made two free throws and, with less than 16 seconds left, Fisher made
both free throws for the Lakers' first lead since 38-37. Fisher was
fouled by Malik Rose while rebounding another Duncan miss, another
borderline call.</TE>
<TE>   In five fourth-quarter minutes, Fisher made his only field goal
and both free throws, like Horry filling the gaps left by O'Neal and
Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what I like about it?" Laker forward Rick Fox said. "I
like that we won games that were close against good teams."</TE>
<TE>   Fox, who a day before wondered if the Spurs weren't still "scared"
of the Lakers, maintained that view.</TE>
<TE>   "You know you look in somebody's eyes and you can tell whether
they believe or not?" he said. "I think a lot was still lingering
from last year."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers swept the Spurs in the conference finals last season.</TE>
<TE>   "If you ask me to be humble about what we do, I can't be," Fox
said. "I'm very confident with what we do."</TE>

<HD>Show, and Shoes, Go on for Sorenstam</HD>
<DH>Golf: Footwear is as eye- catching as her game, which
produces second straight Nabisco title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RANCHO MIRAGE</DL>
<LD>The sun never sets on Annika Days anymore.</LD>
<LD>   It's starting to seem like sort of a golfing empire these days, at
least on the LPGA Tour, where Annika Sorenstam showed once again that
there is only one player in charge and it just happens to be the
woman with the fire engine-red shoes and the shades pushed back on
her cap.</LD>
<LD>   Sorenstam toured Mission Hills Country Club with precision
shotmaking, finished with a four-under-par 68 Sunday and won the
Kraft Nabisco Championship by one shot over Liselotte Neumann.</LD>
<TE>   If Sorenstam was making some kind of statement with her
eight-under 280 score, she was making some other kind of statement
with those bright red, shiny shoes. Sorenstam said she had them in
the back of her locker all week, but didn't dare try them until
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'If I'm not afraid to wear those, then I'm not afraid
to play,'" she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why I put them on. Every time I would stand over a
putt, I would see those little red toes. It would make me smile."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever it takes. Of course, a four-birdie, no-bogey day, her
best round of the week, didn't hurt either.</TE>
<TE>   It was Sorenstam's second consecutive victory at Mission Hills in
the LPGA's first major of the year. It also was her fourth major
title. The 31-year-old Swede, who won eight times last year, has two
more this year and a total of 33 in her nine-year career. Sorenstam
is the first to win back-to-back titles at Mission Hills since the
event became a major championship in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   And the Sorenstam-Karrie Webb showdown? It didn't show up. While
Webb had one of those off days, Sorenstam was way, way on.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam impressed even herself with her ability to play so well
at such an important time.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no better feeling than to work hard and play this golf
course well," she said.</TE>
<TE>   So what happened to Webb?</TE>
<TE>   "Karrie and I have had our battles," Sorenstam said. "She's such a
great player. It doesn't mean she won't be up there. Today is just my
turn."</TE>
<TE>   Someone pointed out that she has had a lot turns lately.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I don't mind," Sorenstam said.</TE>
<TE>   She started quickly with birdies on the fifth and sixth holes, the
result of eight-iron approaches that left her with putts of seven
feet and nine feet.</TE>
<TE>   Neumann, who closed with a 69, was right there beside her with two
birdies on the front nine. But when they made the turn, the next two
holes tilted the tournament toward Sorenstam.</TE>
<TE>   At the par-four 10th, Sorenstam hit a seven-iron and the ball
stopped three feet from the hole. She made the putt and took a
one-shot lead.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam made par at the par-five 11th, but Neumann wasn't as
fortunate. Her drive was off-line and landed in the right rough. She
pitched out to the fairway and her five-iron third shot drifted into
the left greenside bunker. Neumann splashed out of the sand to eight
feet, but missed the putt for par and settled for a bogey and a
two-shot deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a big mistake," Neumann said. "When you make a bogey on
a hole that's reachable in two. At least I was strong enough to make
two birdies in a row after that."</TE>
<TE>   Neumann rolled in a six-footer to birdie the 12th to cut
Sorenstam's lead to one, but she never pulled even. Both players made
birdies at the 13th from close range and by the time they reached the
18th tee, Sorenstam still was holding her one-shot lead.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the final 18 holes, it was a two-player race between
Sorenstam and Neumann, two Swedes who spend more time in the desert
than cactus. Sorenstam has a house at Bighorn and Neumann was here
often enough during the winter to play 10 rounds at Mission Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Webb didn't have the kind of closing round she was looking for,
which is what happens when you don't make a birdie until the 16th
hole. Webb's 72, including a birdie putt that lipped out at the 18th,
dropped her from a share of the 54-hole lead to seventh place. Rosie
Jones shot a 69 and tied for third with Cristie Kerr, who had a 68.</TE>
<TE>   Carin Koch and Akiko Fukushima both shot 66 and tied for fifth at
five-under 283.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam's tee shot at the 18th was down the middle, but
Neumann's drive was in the right rough and her second shot found a
bunker. Sorenstam's second shot was in the springy rough on the left
and she managed to knock her ball 18 feet above the hole. Neumann had
a decent lie in the bunker and knocked it out to 15 feet below the
hole.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam looked at the toes of her red shoes and hit the putt,
rolling it about two feet past on the right.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of marking her ball, she got permission from Neumann and
Webb to play out, so she rolled it right in and waited to see if
Neumann could catch her with the only chance she had.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to mark it and look at it for 10 minutes,"
Sorenstam said.</TE>
<TE>   Neumann said she didn't have any problem with Sorenstam putting
out. She also had no problem with Sorenstam's shoes ("they were
cool") or finishing second in a major, because she played well enough
to win ... almost.</TE>
<TE>   "Boy, was that close," Neumann said.</TE>
<TE>   Close, all right, but if there's anything we have learned about
the way things are going these days, the woman in the red shoes is
hard to beat.</TE>

<LD>Annika Sorenstam, who won the Kraft Nabisco Championship Sunday at
Mission Hills Country Club, is going to have a busy week.</LD>
<LD>   Sorenstam, who set a record last year when she came from 10 shots
down to win the Office Depot Championship at Wilshire Country Club,
her fourth consecutive LPGA Tour victory, is back for more.</LD>
<LD>   This week, Sorenstam returns to defend her title, but at El
Caballero Country Club in Tarzana and for a purse that has been
increased $200,000 to $1 million.</LD>
<TE>   Sorenstam and Karrie Webb, the No. 1- and No. 2-ranked players,
who were in the last group of Sunday's Kraft Nabisco Championship,
lead a strong field in the Office Depot tournament, which is hosted
by Amy Alcott.</TE>
<TE>   Se Ri Pak, Rosie Jones, Lori Kane, Liselotte Neumann, Laura Diaz
and Mi Hyun Kim are among the top players who have entered the event.</TE>
<TE>   Last year at Wilshire, Sorenstam started the final round 10 shots
behind leader Pat Hurst, but finished with a 66. When Hurst closed
with a 77, Sorenstam wound up in a playoff with Kim, who had a 65.
Sorenstam beat Kim on the first hole of a sudden-death playoff.</TE>
<TE>   The Office Depot is the 25th of the LPGA's 31 official events to
offer prize money of at least $1 million, up from 12 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The 54-hole event is Friday, Saturday and Sunday.</TE>

<HD>Maryland Tries to Separate Hoosier Fact From Fiction</HD>
<DH>Men: Terrapins say they won't let Indiana's filmlike path
to title game lull them into false security.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Indiana forward Jarrad Odle had a DVD of the movie "Hoosiers" in his
gym bag Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Guard Kyle Hornsby used to watch the video before every high
school game, and guard Dane Fife says he still likes to walk into an
empty gym and yell "Hickory!" for fictional Hickory High, the tiny
school that won Indiana's state high school championship in the film.</LD>
<LD>   Hard to fathom, but the school that has won five national
championships--more than any other school except UCLA and
Kentucky--is one of the NCAA tournament's great underdogs tonight in
the national championship game against Maryland at the Georgia Dome.</LD>
<TE>   Maryland (31-4) has never won an NCAA title despite a history that
includes such players as John Lucas, Len Bias, Joe Smith and Steve
Francis. But the Terrapins are a top-seeded team that was ranked as
high as No. 2 in the Associated Press poll this season.</TE>
<TE>   They're back in the Final Four for the second consecutive
year--this time with a senior-dominated team and the tournament's top
scorer, guard Juan Dixon, averaging more than 27 points a game.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana (25-11) wasn't even ranked in the final poll and is
seeking to tie the 1988 Kansas team as the only one with as many as
11 losses to win an NCAA title.</TE>
<TE>   The Hoosiers, seeded fifth, are also seeking to join the Jayhawks
as one of the few teams seeded lower than fourth to have won: Two No.
6s did it, North Carolina State in 1983 and Kansas in 1988, and No. 8
Villanova won in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Everything says Indiana can't win, which is plenty to make
Maryland Coach Gary Williams fret.</TE>
<TE>   After all, Indiana beat not only Maryland's nemesis, Duke, but an
Oklahoma team that beat Maryland by 16 points this season.</TE>
<TE>   The loosey-goosey Hoosiers, meanwhile, are continually quizzed on
their seeming lack of athleticism.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you a lot more athletic than people realize?" someone asked.</TE>
<TE>   Fife leaned forward to a microphone.</TE>
<TE>   "No," he said, to peals of laughter.</TE>
<TE>   Hornsby took his turn next.</TE>
<TE>   "I can dunk ... but not very well," he said. "I think they
overlook how well we play together, that we actually know how to play
this game. I think we are very smart basketball players, and
sometimes that can overcome athletic ability."</TE>
<TE>   So can torrid shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana has shot 55% in its five NCAA tournament games, and never
less than 50%.</TE>
<TE>   From three-point range, the Hoosiers are shooting 52.9%, making 37
of 70, including that stunning 15 of 19 against Kent State.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to really get out hard on them," Williams said. "When
you do that, you open up [Jared] Jeffries in the middle there. We had
the same problem with [Kansas shooters Jeff Boschee and Kirk
Hinrich]--if you go too hard, there's [Drew] Gooden and Nick
[Collison] in the middle.</TE>
<TE>   "I sometimes think three-point shooting gets a lot of attention,
but I think it was against Duke they hardly made any threes [two of
10], yet they still won that game. They're just a good basketball
team."</TE>
<TE>   Still, they are going against a very, very good one.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana must contend not only with Dixon but with a stable of
powerfully athletic inside players--center Lonny Baxter and forward
Chris Wilcox as well as Tahj Holden and Ryan Randle, who came off the
bench to help beat Kansas in the semifinals after Baxter got into
early foul trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed he got in foul trouble because he probably got
his bad game out of the way," Indiana Coach Mike Davis said. "I
watched him play UConn, where he had [29] points. I was thinking to
myself, 'If we play them, how do we guard him?'"</TE>
<TE>   Indiana's inside players are gifted, but not as physically strong.
Jeffries is 6 feet 10 and 215 pounds, and Jeff Newton, who came off
the bench to help beat Oklahoma, is 6-9 and 210.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter is 6-8, 260, and Wilcox is 6-10, 220 but ferociously
athletic.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you have to go right back at them," Jeffries said.
"Whenever guys are good on offense, it's important to put pressure on
them and make them guard you. If you can get a couple of fouls on
Wilcox, a couple of fouls on Lonny Baxter, then that benefits you. If
you let them do what they want to on offense and they don't have to
guard you on the other end, then they're going to have big games."</TE>
<TE>   Indiana is a twist on your usual underdog, but these teams have
one thing in common: They have been through a lot.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana's players endured the Bob Knight firing saga less than two
years ago, turning to former assistant Mike Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "I can still remember standing outside Coach Knight's house after
we went to speak to him," Odle said. "Of course everyone was talking
about transferring and leaving, but we kind of looked around at each
other. I told everyone, hey, we can have a heck of a team, and I
think everyone just bought into that."</TE>
<TE>   Some of Maryland's players have endured a pain far deeper.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon lost both parents to complications from AIDS before he
finished high school, and forward Byron Mouton lost his older
brother, Kevin, in a shooting incident in Houston during the season.</TE>
<TE>   "That has a lot to do with why they are so tough," Baxter said.
"They overcame very tragic things."</TE>
<TE>   Knight's firing was hardly tragedy--except in much of Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   "The number of people rooting against us has gotten smaller and
smaller as we've gone further and further in the tournament," Hornsby
said. "People have their biases. Some people are quite set in their
ways, especially in Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   "It had been a certain way for 29 years. Some people were more
Coach Knight fans than they were IU fans.... Some people will never
change."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Indiana's program has.</TE>
<TE>   Davis committed sacrilege by publicly calling the Hoosiers "soft"
after he took over.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Coach Davis has a lot to do with our toughness," said
guard Tom Coverdale, who proved his determination by playing against
Oklahoma despite a badly sprained ankle he predicts will be better
for tonight's game.</TE>
<TE>   "When he took over last year, this team was soft. I remember after
the press conference, he said, 'Everybody be here at 5:45.' We had
conditioning and only four guys even finished the workout. Guys were
puking and couldn't finish.... Hearing we're not tough just makes us
mad. I thought we were tougher than OU."</TE>
<TE>   And they have stayed far longer at the dance than any of Knight's
last six Indiana teams, which all lost in the first or second round.</TE>
<TE>   When Indiana was upset by Iowa in the Big Ten tournament on a shot
by former Hoosier Luke Recker, Hornsby agonized.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember sitting in the locker room and thinking, this cannot
be another year where we lose in the Big Ten tournament and then go
and lose in the NCAAs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Making it to the national championship game and winning the
national championship game was always our goal, but it seemed so far
away at the time."</TE>
<TE>   Maryland is so close to breaking into that Atlantic Coast
Conference club so dominated by Duke and North Carolina over the
years that fans at the Final Four seem almost as gleeful about the
Blue Devils' absence as Maryland's presence.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's Duke?" the handmade banners read.</TE>
<TE>   Ask Indiana, which decked the No. 1-ranked Blue Devils.</TE>
<TE>   "People counted them out against Duke, and they proved them wrong
by beating a great Duke team," Dixon said. "I can guarantee you we're
not going to underestimate Indiana at all."</TE>
<TE>   Indiana has never lost a national championship game, winning in
1940, '53, '76, '81 and '87.</TE>
<TE>   "We are one game away," Fife said. "If we don't win, there's not
going to be a parade. There might be a few people there to throw
tomatoes at us at Assembly Hall if we lose."</TE>

<HD>When Two Worlds Collide</HD>
<DH>Final: Lives of Maryland's Dixon and Indiana's Fife are
vastly different, but the two share the same goal tonight: a national
title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Dane Fife never watched his mother mainline heroin, never sat for
hours with his brother in a sweltering car while their father scored
dope.</LD>
<LD>   Juan Dixon never cruised through a mall in a comfy Michigan
suburb, never felt the special bond of playing high school basketball
for his father.</LD>
<LD>   They've spent their lives worlds apart. Tonight they will be
inches away.</LD>
<TE>   From a national championship.</TE>
<TE>   From one another.</TE>
<TE>   Fife is Indiana's defensive dragon slayer, a brash senior guard
who in the last three NCAA tournament games doused the flame in
Oklahoma's Hollis Price, Kent State's Trevor Huffman and Duke's Jason
Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon is Maryland's fire-breather, an equally brash senior guard
who scorched Kansas for 33 points in a semifinal and is averaging
27.4 in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "I have the utmost and amazing respect for Juan Dixon," Fife said.
"What he has gone through in his life is amazing. He is the catalyst
for Maryland basketball."</TE>
<TE>   Fife is attuned to the personal nature of the matchup, relishing
the idea of curbing the production of the player who did not allow
the drug use and eventual death of his parents to derail his dream.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon prefers to think in terms of his own performance, viewing
the challenge as Juan on Juan rather than one on one.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not worried at all, man, I'm just going to go out and play my
game," Dixon said. "I had a chance to see him play a couple of times,
but for the most part, if I play my game, play hard like I've been
doing all season long, I think I'll be fine."</TE>
<TE>   The best way for Fife to get Dixon's attention would be doing
something dirty. Not dirty as in underhanded, dirty as in slovenly.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon is a self-described neat freak, an obsession he admits is
tied to his parents dying seven years ago from AIDS complications as
a result of using dirty hypodermic needles.</TE>
<TE>   He brings his own toilet paper into the locker room, re-showers 45
minutes before games, washes his hands after pregame warmups and puts
lotion on his hands moments before tipoff.</TE>
<TE>   "I have cleanliness rituals because I'm superstitious like a lot
of basketball players," he said. "I got it from my parents."</TE>
<TE>   Fife probably doesn't even clean the dirt from under his
fingernails. He bit Iowa's Duez Henderson on the forearm during a
nationally televised game two years ago and pulled Illinois' Robert
Archibald to the floor by the ankle in February.</TE>
<TE>   At age 12, he punched his older brother's friend--a 240-pound
University of Michigan football player--in the groin for waking him
up. Fife, the Big Ten Conference defensive player of the year and
Indiana's last vestige of Bob Knight-inspired, square-jawed
intensity, will do whatever it takes to win.</TE>
<TE>   Even in practice.</TE>
<TE>   "He does the same things [to his teammates]," Indiana guard Kyle
Hornsby said. "He bumps you, he tries to get you mad. He doesn't back
down."</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't score much, either, which makes this matchup more
interesting when Maryland has the ball. Fife is such a non-threat on
offense that Dixon will be able to double-team Hoosier forward Jared
Jeffries when necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Fife averages only 8.5 points, although his three-point shooting
has improved drastically. He has made 63 of 132 (47.7%) after hitting
only 33 of 121 (27.3%) his first three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon is one of the best shooters in the nation, averaging 20.5
points on a wide assortment of shots. He is also a 90% free-throw
shooter.</TE>
<TE>   On the surface it seems everything about these adversaries is
polar opposite. But there are similarities.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon learned his offense the same way Fife learned his
defense--from a brother. Phil Dixon, now a Maryland police officer,
was a Division III All-American at Shenandoah Valley College. He also
helped raise Juan and their younger sister and brother.</TE>
<TE>   Fife's brother Dugan played in a Final Four for Michigan. He
toughened Dane with his fists, although now they are very close.</TE>
<TE>   "He beat the ... out of me," said Fife, who became the state's Mr.
Basketball as a high school junior and senior, playing for his
father, Dan, the coach at Clarkston High.</TE>
<TE>   So there was strife in Fife's life, just nothing near the level
encountered by Dixon, who has his parents' names tattooed over his
left biceps.</TE>
<TE>   "They are here in spirit and are watching me," he said. "Hopefully
they can get me through one more game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not feeling any pressure at all. This is supposed to be fun."</TE>
<TE>   Until the moment Fife sets eyes on him. Indiana players were
jokingly wondering which actors would be cast in a re-make of
"Hoosiers" involving this team.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like Rambo, you know, Sylvester Stallone," Fife said. "With
the headband and camouflage. That's me."</TE>

<LD>It is generally unwise to read too much into the events of a season
opener, one game in a long schedule.</LD>
<LD>   Then again, is it just too cynical to point out that the way the
Angels opened the 2002 season Sunday night was numbingly similar to
the way they ended the 2001 season?</LD>
<LD>   In fact, it was only a few minutes after the eight members of the
Navy SEAL skydiving team had landed on the outfield grass at Edison
Field as the highlight of a patriotic pregame ceremony that the hype
and hope that began building when Disney turned serious in the
off-season suffered an initial grounding.</LD>
<TE>   For an excited crowd of 42,697, it was suddenly September again,
the month when the Angels' wild-card hopes evaporated amid 25 losses
in their last 31 games, including seven in a row to end the season.</TE>
<TE>   Operating without Roberto Alomar, Juan Gonzalez and Kenny Lofton,
the Cleveland Indians scored four runs in the first inning and went
on to a 6-0 victory behind Bartolo Colon's five-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Mike Scioscia, beginning his third season as the Angel
manager and spin doctor and convinced that his club is a contender
(of course, when hasn't he been?), was trying to ask the media to
keep the results in perspective even before the first pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "The opener probably draws more of a microscope than any other
game during the season," Scioscia said. "Obviously, if you play well,
you hope it carries over.</TE>
<TE>   "But honestly, it's one of 162 games and its impact on the season
may be overstated as far as what we have to do to be a championship
team."</TE>
<TE>   What the Angels have to do to reach that lofty level has been
chronicled.</TE>
<TE>   They need quality innings from a rotation enhanced by the
additions of Kevin Appier and Aaron Sele, and increased run
production from an offense that outscored only Baltimore and Tampa
Bay last season. In particular, they need Darin Erstad and Tim Salmon
to regain their form of two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "If spring training was a litmus test, every level is where we
hoped it would be," Scioscia said before every level failed in the
opener.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon struck out twice, grounded meekly in front of the plate and
contributed a throwing error to Cleveland's first-inning push. Erstad
had only an infield hit in four at-bats and got a bad jump on Jim
Thome's shallow fly that fell for a bloop single as the Indians built
their first-inning lead against Jarrod Washburn, the young
left-hander being touted as his club's new ace.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to criticize Scioscia and the Angels for showing faith
in one of their own by starting Washburn, but the adrenaline may not
have been pumping as much for the more experienced Appier or Sele.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn insisted it wasn't a case of nerves, but he walked
leadoff batter Matt Lawton and consistently was behind in the count
during that first inning in which the first five Indians reached
base.</TE>
<TE>   "I made good pitches, they got their bats on the ball, a few
bloopers fell and it exploded into a big inning and ruined any
excitement we had going into the opener," Washburn said. "It's very
frustrating to lose any time and I'll take full responsibility. I put
us in a hole that was impossible to come back from the way Colon was
pitching."</TE>
<TE>   If the Indians are to remain dominant in the American League
Central as they retrench financially and rebuild with younger
players, it will probably have to be done more with pitching than
their once-celebrated power, and much will hinge this season on a
rotation that includes Colon, C.C. Sabathia (who faces the Angels on
Tuesday night), Chuck Finley (who starts Wednesday) and Danys Baez.</TE>
<TE>   Colon was 0-2 with a 5.40 earned-run average against the Angels
last year, when he was 14-12 overall, but the Angels never mounted a
serious threat against the 28-year-old right-hander, who was still
throwing in the high 90s in the ninth inning and needed only 98
pitches to finish what he started.</TE>
<TE>   It is rare to get a complete game on opening day and rarer yet to
get a shutout. This, in fact, was the first opening-day shutout since
Dwight Gooden of the New York Mets beat the Colorado Rockies in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "We did a better job against Colon last year," the understated
Scioscia said, "but he was the story of the game tonight. Wash came
back and settled down after the first inning, but we couldn't do
anything with our bats. You tip your cap, turn the page and go on."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the Angels will have a brief wait before going on.</TE>
<TE>   They are off today before trying to snap a 10-game home losing
streak Tuesday night against Sabathia, who was the American League's
rookie pitcher of the year in 2001, when he went 17-5. The Indians
may not pound the ball as they once did with Alomar, Lofton and
Gonzalez gone, but they can still throw their weight around
considering Colon and Sabathia are said to tip the scales at more
than 550 pounds combined.</TE>
<TE>   In sitting on the Angels in the opener, Colon disappointed the
partisans in a sellout crowd attracted by developments of the
off-season but still skeptical about a franchise that has not been to
the playoffs since 1986. There were boos, in fact, as early as that
first inning Sunday night while the visitors--as it always is in
Anaheim-- drew pockets of support as they produced a four-run Easter
parade that proved to be decisive behind Colon.</TE>
<TE>   The Angel manager understands the way it is in Anaheim and knows
only one thing will convince the skeptics.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line?" Scioscia said. "We have to win. It's the only
thing that will put the Anaheim Angels on the map."</TE>
<TE>   One game in a new season is not enough to say that won't happen,
but linked--fairly or not--to the final games of last season, the
opener takes on a different tone.</TE>

<KH>AROUND THE LEAGUE</KH>
<HD>Giants Will Start Season Without Kent</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Francisco Giants have decided to open the season with second
baseman Jeff Kent, who has a broken left wrist, on the 15-day
disabled list.</LD>
<LD>   Kent has been playing in Arizona with Fresno, the Giants' triple-A
affiliate in the Pacific Coast League. He had three hits in seven
at-bats and played all nine innings in a Saturday game.</LD>
<LD>   Kent is eligible to be activated Saturday. The Giants open their
season Tuesday against the Dodgers at Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   The National League MVP in 1999, Kent told reporters he injured
his wrist while washing his truck. But later reports said he may have
had an accident while riding his motorcycle near the Giants' spring
home, Scottsdale Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Looking on the bright side, Giant Manager Dusty Baker said at
least the injury didn't happen late in the season, when Kent's health
will be essential.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to lose them, you might as well lose them early,"
Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants also put right-handed starter Jason Schmidt, who has a
strained groin, on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to March 21.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tim Raines was added to the Florida roster and will spend his 23rd
major league season with the Marlins. Raines, 42, will be used mostly
as a pinch-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   Raines is coming back from a debilitating battle with lupus, which
sidelined him in July 1999. He returned last season and played in 51
games for Montreal and Baltimore, batting .303.</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Todd Walker of the Cincinnati Reds was hit on the
left side of the face by a batted ball during the club's workout
Sunday, but was expected to play in their season opener.</TE>

<HD>There's No Match for Huskies</HD>
<DH>Women: Connecticut holds off Oklahoma, 82-70, in NCAA final
to complete 39-0 season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>There are no more superlatives needed, no more oohs or ahs to render.</LD>
<LD>   The talent and the record of the Connecticut Huskies can speak for
itself.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, what many have called the best women's college
basketball team ever concluded its season with an 82-70 victory over
Oklahoma to take the NCAA tournament championship before 29,619 at
the Alamodome.</LD>
<TE>   In winning its second title in the last three years, the Huskies
equaled the 39-0 single-season record set by Tennessee in 1997-98.
But Connecticut, which became the first women's team to have two
undefeated championship seasons, stands out as women's basketball's
top program. The Huskies' other undefeated championship season was
35-0 in 1994-95.</TE>
<TE>   "The pressure to win has never been here," Connecticut Coach Geno
Auriemma said. "What has been here was the belief that if we did it
right, we would win the national championship. We felt that way ever
since the loss to Notre Dame in last year's Final Four."</TE>
<TE>   When asked if he had the greatest team ever, Auriemma deferred.
"You can say we were the best team this year. You can't say we're the
best ever because it's hard to compare eras."</TE>
<TE>   It was by no means a perfect sendoff for Connecticut. Oklahoma,
playing in its first Final Four and NCAA title game, made the Huskies
earn their title.</TE>
<TE>   Despite being badly outrebounded, 44-25, and outshot, 52.6% to
38.7%, the Sooners made it a game by pestering the Huskies into 21
turnovers and keeping Connecticut from making a three-point shot, the
first time that has happened in an NCAA title game.</TE>
<TE>   With 1:31 to play Oklahoma (32-4) trailed, 73-67, when Connecticut
guard Diana Taurasi (13 points) was fouled by Sooner guard Stacey
Dales while spinning into the lane to make a short jumper. It was
Dales' fifth foul, depriving Oklahoma of its leading scorer (18
points) and its heartbeat. Taurasi completed the three-point play,
and Connecticut had all the space it needed to secure the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "That was huge," said Connecticut's Sue Bird of Taurasi's play.
"Di was backing in, and she's got such great body control that she
can take the hit, foul out Dales--which is also huge--and make the
bucket at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   When the Sooners committed their 15th and last turnover with 18
seconds left, Bird dribbled out the clock, tossed the ball in the air
and joined the crush of teammates to celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't put it into words," said Swin Cash, who led all scorers
with 20 and was named the tournament's most outstanding player. "When
the buzzer went off ... I think of all the emotions and different
things that run through your head.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it has totally hit us yet. Give it a week or two,
and I'm wondering what time are the workouts, and we don't have any
anymore. That's when it will hit you."</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma was left to ponder a season in which it achieved plenty,
including a school record for victories and becoming the first Big 12
team to reach the title game since the conference was formed in
1996-97.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be happier if we won," Oklahoma Coach Sherri Coale said.
"But I'm so proud for the season we had and the journey we had. I
knew this afternoon I would be sad either way.</TE>
<TE>   "Our seniors are incredible kids, and they can forever feel part
of something right."</TE>
<TE>   The Sooners had stressed the importance of staying with
Connecticut on the boards. But the Huskies' first 10 points came on
second shots after offensive rebounds. Not only did the Huskies
establish whose frontcourt was in control but, by getting a 12-4
lead, Connecticut forced Oklahoma to play uphill from the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   "Their frontcourt is very physical and very talented," said Dales,
speaking of Connecticut's power forward trio of Cash, Tamika Williams
and Asjha Jones. "They are very underrated for what they do for their
team."</TE>
<TE>   A driving layup by Dales with 2:28 left in the first half cut
Connecticut's lead to 34-30, and the Sooners were thinking they could
be the first team this season to tie or lead Connecticut at halftime.
But the Huskies swiped the momentum, scoring the last eight points to
go ahead, 42-30.</TE>
