<LD>Does absence make the heart grow fonder, or just make fans forget?
That's the question Sheryl Crow will get an answer to this week when
SoundScan's first-week sales figures show up for her "C'mon, C'mon"
album.</LD>
<LD>   It's been four years since her previous studio album, "The Globe
Sessions"--a couple of lifetimes in terms of the pop music world's
ever-accelerating churn rate.</LD>
<LD>   During that period, she has given her time to numerous benefit
concerts and has become one of the prime movers behind the fledgling
Recording Artists Coalition, an organization she and Don Henley have
launched to give musicians a voice on Capitol Hill regarding
legislation that affects the recording industry.</LD>
<TE>   Early returns from retailers indicate that the time she's spent on
stage and on camera promoting matters other than her own career
reinforces the adage that all publicity is good publicity. "C'mon,
C'mon" is shaping up as her highest-charting entry to date, and
possibly her first No. 1: She could vault past Ashanti and Celine
Dion to the top of the pop album chart when numbers are released
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "She definitely has a shot at No. 1," says Craig Swedin, assistant
rock buyer for the Wherehouse Entertainment chain. "I think it all
has to do with how Ashanti does nationwide.... I think [Crow's album]
will definitely be No. 1 or No. 2."</TE>
<TE>   Although Crow considers her efforts on behalf of the Recording
Artists Coalition to be "vital," it's music that she still thinks of
as her "real work."</TE>
<TE>   "Don and I laugh about it all the time," she told The Times
recently. "We could spend our entire lives just working on artists'
issues and never making music. I have to be really careful about
getting my real work done."</TE>
<TE>   That work is expected to include a summer tour, but the only date
Crow has scheduled in the immediate future is her appearance Saturday
at Fan Nation 2 at Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in Irvine, where
fans can hear musicians play and sit in as they take part in chat
sessions offstage.</TE>

<HD>A Boisterous Disaster Zone of Punk Pop</HD>
<DH>Green Day and Blink-182 click as Pop Disaster Tour
headliners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Punk rock is an old tradition now, as much a fixture in popular music
as the blues and heavy metal. Credit and blame for transforming the
revolutionary into pop is partly shared by Green Day and Blink-182.</LD>
<LD>   Both have endured criticism for recasting the ideas of punk
pioneers into pop singles, but Green Day and Blink-182 are not
footnotes to that punk lineage. They are part of it.</LD>
<LD>   The underground remains a healthy breeding ground for new ideas
with the likes of White Stripes. But Green Day has achieved what the
Ramones themselves always wanted but never got: mainstream
popularity.</LD>
<TE>   At the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in Irvine on Saturday, both
acts arrived as co-headliners of the Pop Disaster Tour, their first
road trip together. The tour includes a stop Wednesday at the Forum
in Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Green Day and Blink have shared fans, producers and
radio playlists, but in the first of two shows at Verizon, these
California punk trios also revealed vast differences.</TE>
<TE>   Some things never change. "Hey! No fighting," Green Day
singer-guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong shouted early in his set,
interrupting "Welcome to Paradise," and pointing into the mosh pit.
"Hey, bald guy--chill out! We're here to have a good ... time."</TE>
<TE>   Before the band's final comical, chaotic moments--with Mike Dirnt
smashing his bass to pieces and Tre Cool tumbling forward over his
drum kit--Green Day displayed a live polish and pacing that kept the
set energetic and fun.</TE>
<TE>   The band entered to the sound of air-raid sirens, in keeping with
the Pop Disaster theme. But aside from the occasional burst of
flames, cloud of confetti or lighting gimmick, Green Day leaned most
heavily on the muscle of its material, which matched the tough
riffing of "Brain Stew" with the Beatles-like pop of "Redundant."</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong made for a charismatic frontman, dressed in black
threads, a white tie loose around his neck. He led the trio through a
series of hits, dropping in bits of Metallica, Marilyn Manson and
"Sweet Home Alabama" before performing the early Green Day song "The
Disappearing Boy," which sounded a lot like new Green Day.</TE>
<TE>   Easily the night's most memorable moment was when Armstrong pulled
a pair of fans up from the crowd, taught them a few fast chords on
guitar and bass, and let them play a song. Intentional or not, the
stunt underlined one of the greatest traditions of punk rock,
eliminating the divide between rock star and fan.</TE>
<TE>   Blink-182 was not nearly as tight a musical unit, but in the past
that's only added to the band's reckless charm, with lyrics at times
deeply moving or happily sick and twisted. From the beginning of its
set, the SoCal trio was rougher around the edges, launching with the
uplifting "The Rock Show."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, singer-bassist Mark Hoppus was moved to declare, "We are
wonderful this evening!" Singer-guitarist Tom DeLonge added, "If you
want perfection, sleep with me."</TE>
<TE>   That brand of punk humor has long been a key spontaneous element
of Blink's live shows, a tradition already taken to vaudevillian
perfection by NOFX. But on Saturday, Blink's timing seemed a bit off.</TE>
<TE>   In the night's closing set, Blink was often less successful in
connecting with the crowd, though at least some of that could be
blamed on a sudden drop in temperature at the outdoor venue. "Maybe
it's past Orange County's bedtime," joked DeLonge.</TE>
<TE>   Though much of the band's set was clearly timed and choreographed
to a variety of lighting effects and explosions, Blink often seemed
like a band without a plan. The trio and crowd did come alive during
their best-known songs, such as the suicide-themed "Adam's Song."</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the night Travis Barker's entire drum set-up was
lifted from the stage and twirled upside-down during his own drum
solo, metal style. Whether designed to be serious or ironic, the
stunt at least suggested that punk rock isn't the only genre worth
raiding.</TE>
<TE>   Despite vague categorization as "emo-core," Pop Disaster support
act Jimmy Eat World shares the same punk rock tradition, having
already earned a gold record for its debut album with the catchy hit
"The Middle," along with such moodier rock songs as "Get It Faster."
Unfortunately, extensive security searches at the gate meant many
fans missed the band's 30-minute set.</TE>

<HD>The American Wild West Meets Italian Opera</HD>
<DH>Set design and orchestra make Donizetti's 'Don Pasquale' a
cheerful success but can't help vocal weaknesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A brilliant concept, consistently realized, made San Diego Opera's
new production of Donizetti's "Don Pasquale" a tidy success when it
opened Saturday night in Civic Theatre. Only vocal weaknesses in the
otherwise effective quartet of principals kept the enterprise, the
handiwork of set designer Tony Fanning and stage director David
Gately, a muted triumph.</LD>
<LD>   Relocating--not updating--the action from its Italian origins to
the wild American West certainly does not contradict the very human,
very funny predicament of the mature, successful gentleman attempting
to take a younger wife. Surrounded by Fanning's attractive, if
cliched, western backdrops and decors, and underlined by Gately's
effective and sometimes inventive staging, it all works, in a
cheerfully comedic way.</LD>
<LD>   Pasquale's mansion becomes a hotel, with an office attached; the
estate garden in the finale turns into a sagebrush and cactus yard;
Ernesto laments Malatesta's apparent betrayal not by himself, but in
a brothel, while being given a bath by ladies of a certain
profession.</LD>
<TE>   Each locale is suggested by a set drop, which, unfortunately, does
not help the singers acoustically. There is, this time around, a lack
of vocal clarity on the Civic Theatre stage; projection seems at a
minimum, and one suspects all these voices are better, and larger,
than they seem to be.</TE>
<TE>   Best of the singers is tenor Matthew Polenzani, who warms up by
Act 2 into a most pleasing Ernesto and looks suitably heroic while
enacting the stage director's clever inventions. Equally good-looking
is his pert Norina, sung by Ying Huang--all four principals are
making San Diego Opera debuts. Huang is small and pretty, reliable in
all her high notes but undistinctive and colorless vocally. She wears
her varied costumes with panache; otherwise, she is not memorable.
The Italian baritone, Bruno Pratico makes a stock Pasquale, ordinary
of voice and pedestrian as an actor. He does not indicate the
dimensions or the contradictions in the character, and he ends by
walking through the part. American baritone Christopher Schaldenbrand
looks almost villainous as Malatesta but disappoints with
one-dimensional singing and acting. David Marshman makes the most of
his cameo as the Notary, and actor Robert Dahey steals scenes as
Hop-Sing, Pasquale's valet. A resourceful chorus, trained by Timothy
Todd Simmons, impersonates the household servants and, at the end, a
mariachi band, in good humor.</TE>
<TE>   The strongest participant in the production is the orchestra,
which again boasts first-rate soloists and commendable ensemble and
balance. Consequently, the genuine hero of the Saturday performance
was conductor Edoardo Muller, who held the entire enterprise together
with elan and wit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Opera's "Don Pasquale" will be repeated Tuesday at 7
p.m., Friday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2:30 p.m. San Diego Civic
Theatre, 1200 3rd Ave., San Diego. $33-$107. (619) 570-1100.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saxophonist Wayne Shorter's creative efforts have been somewhat
uneven in the nearly six years since his wife, Ana Maria, died in the
crash of TWA flight 800. His late '90s duet performances and
recordings with pianist Herbie Hancock were largely contemplative
efforts, probing thoughtfully through the layers of the long-term
musical and personal relationships between the two players. In 2000,
a concert at USC's Bovard Auditorium provided a brief glimpse of
Shorter performing some new compositions in the company of the
University's Thornton Symphony.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday night, however, Shorter returned to Bovard as one of the
headliners in the University's L.A. Jazz 2002, leading a group of
young all-stars in a set that was a powerful display of his
still-potent talents as an improviser and a composer.</LD>
<LD>   The ensemble--pianist Danilo Perez, bassist John Patitucci and
drummer Brian Blade--is the band Shorter has been working with
regularly in recent months. The ensemble also appears on "Footprints
Live!," an album scheduled to be released on Verve in late May. Most
of the material performed at Bovard is present on the album--from
such classic Shorter tunes as "Footprints" to a complex setting of
Sibelius' "Valse Triste."</LD>
<TE>   Shorter was relatively laid-back in the opening part of the
program, tending to improvise with long tones and brief, epigrammatic
phrases contrasted with sudden bursts of notes. As the set continued,
his creative imagination seemed to build, with more and more of the
smooth, flowing, inventive lines that were so characteristic of his
playing in the salad years of the '60s and '70s.</TE>
<TE>   But Shorter's efforts represented only half the story for this
mesmerizing evening. The other half--or more--traces the playing of
Perez, Patitucci and Blade. All are major talents, all have
recordings under their own names, and all performed brilliantly, as
supportive ensemble players and as individual soloists. Blade, in
particular, was a galvanizing force and a catalyst, structuring his
accompaniment with great attention to subtle differences in dynamic
level, sometimes punctuating lines with eye-opening bursts of sound,
at other times simmering below the surface with roiling accents of
rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   Perez brought harmonic cohesion to the improvised passages, via
rhapsodic chording as well as sheer force of his percussive accents.
And Blade intelligently employed his amazing virtuosity to shape and
frame the overall proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   In sum, the performance was a sparkling example of contemporary
jazz at its world-class finest, and a welcome return of Shorter to
the top level of his art.</TE>

<HD>Luckman Pays Tribute to Mingus</HD>
<DH>The group plays the composer's varied works, reflecting his
interest in Duke Ellington, Latin beats and gospel roots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every time the Luckman Jazz Orchestra offers one of its far too rare
performances, the first question that comes to mind is why this fine
ensemble doesn't have a much longer performance schedule. Granted,
costs can be high for appearances by a 16-piece musical organization,
but it's hard to believe that in a community as economically viable
and as culturally aware as Los Angeles that funding--and/or sponsor
support--can't be found for a rainbow aggregation of superb jazz
artists.</LD>
<LD>   And that question was even more present Saturday night at Cal
State L.A.'s attractive Luckman Fine Arts Complex in a performance
titled "Mainly Mingus." James Newton, the jazz orchestra's conductor,
led the ensemble in a superb tribute to Mingus (two days before the
80th anniversary of the bassist-composer's birth) that provided, in
many respects, a particularly convincing link to the original music.
Mingus has begun to receive the recognition he deserves as a major
jazz composer in the decades since his death in 1979. And ensembles
such as the Mingus Big Band have begun to position many of his works
as important standards in the jazz repertoire.</LD>
<TE>   The Luckman orchestra's presentation, however, was more intriguing
on several levels. The first was Newton's choice of material via a
program that touched on many of Mingus' far-ranging interests: his
fascination with Ellington in "Duke Ellington's Sound of Love"; his
attraction to Latin rhythms in "Tijuana Gift Shop" (Mingus was born
in Nogales, Ariz.); his gospel roots "Ecclusiastics"; and the
lyricism that was at the heart of all his music, especially well
displayed in "Goodbye Porkpie Hat" (a tribute to legendary
saxophonist Lester Young).</TE>
<TE>   Equally important was the loose, hard-swinging qualities of the
performance. And the occasional inaccuracies that turned up were,
ironically, more reminiscent of the spontaneous, erratic, but always
enthusiastic qualities of many of the original Mingus performances.</TE>
<TE>   Add to that some stunning solo work from a long list of players,
with special high points provided by trumpeters Carl Saunders and
Snooky Young, trombonist George McMullen, saxophonists Ann Patterson,
Herman Riley and Keith Fiddmont and the superb rhythm section of
Lanny Hartley, piano, Jeff Littleton, bass and Ndugo Chancler, drums.</TE>
<TE>   Best was the improvisatory manner in which Newton brought
everything together--most notably in an epic rendering of Mingus'
"Don't Be Afraid, the Clown's Afraid, Too," filled with
Newton-conducted bursts of sound from the ensemble and a melange of
musical elements rushing against each other in a manner reminiscent
of Charles Ives. Mingus, one suspects, would have loved it.</TE>

<LD>Dead people talking ... and walking.</LD>
<LD>   Bad is one thing, but this week television gets really putrid. It
starts tonight on ABC when George Anderson's chitchat with the dead
includes Robert Blake's slain wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, and continues
Sunday when Ted Danson--as James Van Praagh--talks and even runs away
from the dead on CBS. You just have to be there when spooks pop from
the ground at night and chase him through a forest.</LD>
<LD>   Anderson's special is "Contact: Talking to the Dead," the Van
Praagh miniseries "Living With the Dead." This is living? Well before
the final credits roll, you're the one feeling dead.</LD>
<TE>   Along with the Sci-Fi Channel's John Edward ("Crossing Over"),
Anderson and Van Praagh are mediums who make fancy livings claiming
to chat up the departed. Now I'm not saying these showmen are
grifters who don't actually talk to the dead. As someone who would
welcome life after death, I hope they're sincere. I'd love to be
dialed up by one of them at a much later date, although I'm warning
my family now, I'll entertain no questions about TV in the afterlife.</TE>
<TE>   It's just that I'd like it better if they contacted dead people
from whom we could all benefit. Is there a statute of limitations on
deadspeak? How about sounding out some of the Founding Fathers on
whether they believe the U.S. Constitution they drafted in 1787
should be obeyed word for word in 2002? Or Marilyn Monroe about those
rumored close-ups with Jack and Bobby Kennedy, and if she really took
her own life. Or Moses: C'mon, now, the Red Sea really parted? Or
George Custer: What were you thinking? Or Edward R. Murrow: How much
time do you devote each day to twisting in your grave? Or Aristotle?
Or Billie Holiday?</TE>
<TE>   And yes, all right, Jack the Ripper: Who are you really, and are
you and your victims now getting along better?</TE>
<TE>   Somehow this seems a bit beyond Anderson, whose program is hosted
by former CNN anchor Jim Moret ("Later ... the murdered wife of
Robert Blake speaks out"), who appears to have misplaced his
circumspection when cleaning out his news desk.</TE>
<TE>   This special was taped before Blake was snapped up by Los Angeles
police Friday and accused of his wife's murder. With Anderson as he
"speaks" to Bakley are her sister and her mother, who hopes to hear
"a clue that no one has picked up on." Fat chance, for Anderson says
Bakley chooses not to explore "the circumstances of my death" because
"the souls, out of love, know exactly what we need to hear." Oh,
sure.</TE>
<TE>   That means these souls--who obviously are not dead
prosecutors--are taking Anderson off the hook as far as revealing who
killed Bakley. The sister says she and her mother don't care because
they already know the slayer's identity. Sure, but what about us?</TE>
<TE>   Anderson tonight does "cold" readings--in which he's said to be
unaware of who his subjects are in advance--also with Mackenzie
Phillips, whose late father was lead singer with the Mamas and Papas;
"Wheel of Fortune" letter-turner Vanna White, who hears from her dead
boyfriend; and pro wrestler Brett "The Hitman" Hart," whose deceased
brother and mother check in from the beyond.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, don't misunderstand what I'm about to say," Anderson tells
Hart, "but your mom's just showed me a scene from [the movie] 'Seven
Brides for Seven Brothers.'" Hart is blown away. It's his favorite
flick? No. He had seven brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Obvious question: Why doesn't his mother just say that instead of
giving this private movie screening? Obvious question No. 2: Why is
she telling Hart he had seven brothers in the first place? He already
knows.</TE>
<TE>   Not to worry, though, because a good, teary time is had by all.
Especially as all of Anderson's miscalls about these dead folks have
been erased by editing, making it appear he's always 100% right.</TE>
<TE>   If Van Praagh didn't exist, meanwhile, Stephen King would have
invented him. CBS says its miniseries is "inspired by the life and
work" of Van Praagh as recorded in his memoir, "Talking to Heaven,"
but you don't need a Ouija board to figure out that "Living With the
Dead" is a title with greater box-office zip. Or that short-ish,
round-ish Van Praagh in real life looks and acts nothing like the
tall leading man playing him in "Living With the Dead."</TE>
<TE>   And does he ever live with them in this story written by John
Pielmeier and directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal. As a kid, Van Praagh
meets another boy who's been dead 30 years. While he's visiting his
dying mother in the hospital, his dead grandmother appears. While
he's shopping in a supermarket, his dead mother appears. During a
session with his therapist, the man's dead wife enters, gobbles some
pills, then dies again. And of course, there are those murdered boys
who haunt him in the forest, as the muttering, tormented Van Praagh
is pushed to the limit while talking to the dead the way Russell
Crowe talks to Ed Harris in "A Beautiful Mind."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know who sent you, but would you please go away," he
pleads with an ever-present dead teenager. Although Van Praagh is a
reluctant hero, it's these dead sightings that have him solving a
homicide and a serial murder case that introduce him to a police
detective, played by Danson's wife, Mary Steenburgen.</TE>
<TE>   There's a bit of suspense at the end in addition to some
tear-jerky manipulation regarding a serious illness. Suffice it to
say that the serial murderer is mad, do you hear, MAD! But if you
can't predict the corny outcome of a search for a missing boy who's
still alive, then you don't know the difference between stories on
broadcast networks and those on HBO and Showtime.</TE>
<TE>   Van Praagh not only predicts the future in this story--something
the real Van Praagh has never claimed to do--but also inserts himself
into the body of someone alive. Uh huh.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the Van Praagh I recall. He did not appear to be
living with the dead when giving me a personal reading in his West
Hollywood home for a column I was writing about him in 1994. He did
chat with my dead stepfather, but mentioned nothing about using his
ability to crack murder cases. Nor are these feats mentioned in his
biography on his Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Because they're fictional.</TE>
<TE>   Although CBS advertises this as Van Praagh's story, Danson says it
really isn't, insisting that he is not actually playing Van Praagh.
Just someone else with Van Praagh's name? The curious thing is that
CBS felt it couldn't complete this fib in one night, so it's taking
two. The real Van Praagh (who appears here briefly as a church
organist) seems not to mind the deception, which after all adds to
his luster as he plans for a TV series he has in the works.</TE>
<TE>   George Anderson says on ABC tonight that when he first realized he
had his unique ability, "I did not know what to do with it." Now he
and Van Praagh know exactly what to do with it.</TE>
<TE>   Make money!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Contact: Talking With the Dead" will be shown tonight at 10 on
ABC. The network has rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable for young
children).</TE>
<TE>   "Living With the Dead" will premiere Sunday and Tuesday nights at
9 on CBS. The network has rated it TV-PG, with an advisory the second
night for violence.</TE>

<HD>'Bachelor': A Little Sweet, a Little Bitter</HD>
<DH>Series * Despite claims that the show is selling female
sexuality, it's a hit with women viewers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANICE RHOSHALLE LITTLEJOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tiffany Anderson has a confession. "I love 'The Bachelor.' I never
miss it," says the 28-year-old cable network publicist. "It's like
watching a train wreck. You want to turn away, but you can't help
wanting to see."</LD>
<LD>   Anderson is not the only one who likes to watch ABC's voyeuristic
dating series. And among women, she is just a small part of a much
larger audience.</LD>
<LD>   The show, which premiered last month with 25 women vying for the
affections of a 31-year-old San Francisco management consultant, is
the second highest-rated midseason program among women 18 to 34 years
old. Last week, the series was No. 1 in its time slot in that
demographic and, according to a network release, has better than
doubled ABC's rating among young women in that hour.</LD>
<TE>   Considering the pervasiveness of melodramatic "reality"
matchmaking shows such as the syndicated "Blind Date," MTV's
"Dismissed" and Fox's "Temptation Island," it's not surprising that
"The Bachelor" has done as well, even without the kind of controversy
showered on Fox's "Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?," which,
like "The Bachelor," was produced by Mike Fleiss.</TE>
<TE>   Like "Multi-Millionaire," arguably the most distasteful aspect of
"The Bachelor" is the idea that a large group of beautiful,
intelligent women--in this case all under 35--would compete to win
the approval of one guy.</TE>
<TE>   "If they were 40, I could understand it better," says Dennis
Prager, the nationally syndicated radio personality heard locally on
KRLA-AM (870), whose frequent focus is morality and ethics. "But
there is no more valuable commodity on Earth than a beautiful
24-year-old woman, so that is the perplexing element."</TE>
<TE>   As absurd as it may be, some women find it "interesting to see to
what extent these women will go to get his attention," says Amy
Nixdoroff, 38, a retail sales associate. "It's hard to step into
these women's shoes, but I am so on their side. They've stepped out
on a limb for love, and I know I could never do that."</TE>
<TE>   Even Prager admits that he was "fascinated" by last week's
episode. "You're sucked in because the people are nice," he says.
"These are not the morons of 'Temptation Island,' where the people
were so vacuous it was simply boring. These are your sweetest fellow
Americans."</TE>
<TE>   For fans of the series, the show plays like a real-life soap
opera--following the escapades of handsome Harvard and Stanford
graduate Alex Michel as he loves up, then winnows down, his adoring
harem to a select few. Viewers are privy to the intimate
conversations, cat fights, awkward sex talk and miserable rejections.
(The woman left sitting without a rose at the end of the episode is
expelled.)</TE>
<TE>   "For a female audience, this show rings true," says series
co-producer Lisa Levinson, who selected the bachelorettes. "So many
women go on blind dates or are single and looking for love. They like
seeing that there is a possibility for true love and that they're not
the only ones being dumped by their boyfriends."</TE>
<TE>   Marathon dumping is another thing. "The producers are creating
tension for ratings by building up as much cattiness as possible,
building in as much potential for distress and people getting hurt as
possible," says Jennifer Pozner, media critic for the feminist
monthly Sojourner, who calls the show a "dangerous" step backward for
women.</TE>
<TE>   "It reinforces the worst of these dating shows, with the values of
'The Donna Reed Show' and 'Leave It to Beaver' era, when women were
supposed to be valued for being pretty and prim and funny but not in
a threatening way," she says. "Smart, but not smarter than the guy.
Engaging, but not in a way that draws too much attention to herself."</TE>
<TE>   Fleiss, however, maintains that too much shouldn't be drawn from
the show, which he says "is about entertainment. It's a weird,
freakish social experiment. It's not meant to be anything more than
something to watch on television. We just wanted to see if we could
get a love affair to unfold in front of the cameras. Wherever that
goes, that's fine with us."</TE>
<TE>   "We're not suggesting this is how the real world should work--that
25 to one is an appropriate ratio," adds bachelor Michel. "Critics
are looking to put a lot of meaning into this show that's not there.
There hasn't been a dating show like this where you have recurring
characters that you're getting to know each week. That's unique, and
people are strangely fascinated by it."</TE>
<TE>   In tonight's episode, Michel will take his remaining three
favorites--Shannon, 24, an operations assistant from Dallas; Trista,
29, a Miami Heat dancer; and Amanda, 23, an event planner from
Kansas--on individual romps to Reno, Hawaii and New York,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Under the show's structure, in Thursday's finale, Michel, who
appears to be most enamored with Shannon, selects his Mrs. Right.
(Producers say Michel was under no contractual obligation to make a
marriage proposal.)</TE>
<TE>   "The woman who wins will ultimately be the loser," wrote one woman
on the show's Internet message board.</TE>
<TE>   "The networks who put on these shows are pimps," Pozner contends,
"providing these women to the guy, making money off of these women's
humiliation and off of creating a false notion of who Alex is, just
like 'Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?' created a false notion
of Rick Rockwell. It's incredibly irresponsible, not only in terms of
the content that we see, but in terms of the lives they're playing
with. They're selling women's sexuality and their emotional
well-being. That can never be a positive thing for viewers or
participants of the show."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it seems more the emotional intercourse and horserace
elements of the series that are driving interest in the show.</TE>
<TE>   And producers are already gearing up to take another ride with
"The Bachelor II"; they're accepting applications for willing
bachelors and the women who want them.</TE>
<TE>   Jill Morrison is seriously considering taking the plunge. "I think
it would be fun," says the 29-year-old handbag saleswoman. "It's just
a game."</TE>
<TE>   Reacting to feminist criticism, producers of "The Bachelor" say
they are considering a pro-femme alternative, "The Bachelorette." The
premise mimics its male-centered counterpart in reverse: one woman
selecting her potential life partner from a lot of 25 men.</TE>
<TE>   Prager, at least, is skeptical as to whether a converse approach
would work. "What woman is going to be intimate with several men at
the same time?" he asked. "Most women would think the woman to be a
jerk. Most men would think the woman is slightly higher than a slut.
Even if there was no intimacy, the thought of a woman being in love
with several men at the same time is weird. What kind of men would
participate in that?"</TE>
<TE>   "It depends on who the woman is," says Fleiss. "I think it will be
another interesting experiment."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Bachelor" airs tonight at 9 on ABC and concludes Thursday
night with two episodes beginning at 8. The network has rated
tonight's episode TV-PG-DS (may be unsuitable for young children,
with advisories for suggestive dialogue and sexuality).</TE>

<HD>Diversity Isn't So Black and White an Issue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLON MOHAMMED</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This year's pilot season (that time of the year when the TV networks
choose the new shows they'll debut in the fall) has been accompanied
by growing demands from minority advocacy groups that the networks
increase the number of minority actors in their new shows. Groups
like the NAACP have threatened boycotts if these demands are not met
and, in the wake of this year's racially charged Academy Awards, it
seems like you can't pick up a newspaper these days without reading
about how TV, and Hollywood in general, needs to become more
"diverse."</LD>
<LD>   As an African American actor, I suppose I should applaud these
efforts to increase the presence of minorities on TV. But I've been
in this business long enough to know that an issue like TV diversity
is far more complex than it is often portrayed.</LD>
<LD>   White actors may get more work than actors of other races but,
numerically, there are many more white actors who are struggling to
make it in the business. To get an idea of the numbers we're dealing
with here, we can consult the Academy Players Directory, a master
list of actors--accomplished and unknown, union and nonunion, with
and without representation.</LD>
<TE>   These figures show that, of 16,235 listed actors, 695 are black (a
little more than 4%), 484 are Latino (about 3%), 378 are Asian (a
little more than 2%) and 170 are Native American (slightly more than
1%). The rest are white.</TE>
<TE>   These figures jibe with my own experience two years ago, when I
helped cast an independent film. I placed an ad in Backstage West,
looking for actors of all races. Of the 2,835 submissions I received,
137 were black, 70 were Latino and about 40 were Asian. The rest were
white.</TE>
<TE>   While it's not possible to comprehensively gauge the number of
actors actively seeking work in the job market, the value of
examining Players Directory and Backstage West statistics is that
these figures account for actors who are seeking work, as opposed to
actors who are already working. These numbers give a good indication
of the supply-side of the actor marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   From these figures, it's not hard to draw the conclusion that
white actors make up the overwhelming majority of actors competing
for work, in which case it's not necessarily wrong that whites are
hired in greater numbers. I just can't support efforts to force the
industry to gerrymander some kind of artificially engineered racial
quota in hiring that doesn't reflect the reality of the job market.</TE>
<TE>   Groups like the NAACP have frequently complained that network TV
doesn't reflect the racial makeup of the United States, but an
extensive TV diversity report released by the Screen Actors Guild in
June 2001 came to the conclusion that "African Americans are
overrepresented in prime time" (italics in the original). While
African Americans make up a little over 12% of the U.S. population,
the report went on to say, they account for nearly 16% of network
prime-time characters.</TE>
<TE>   A separate SAG study of casting data from all productions in 2000
(films as well as TV) found that nonwhites, who make up 19% of SAG
membership, got 23% of all available roles, while white actors, who
constitute 81% of SAG, got only 76% of the available roles (and
African American actors received a higher proportion of leading roles
in movies and TV shows in 2000, as opposed to supporting roles).
Indeed, these statistics suggest that it may be white actors who are
underrepresented! They seem to contradict the statement made in July
2000, by NAACP President Kweisi Mfume, that TV is a "white
landscape."</TE>
<TE>   Latinos and Asians are still underrepresented on network
prime-time TV in relation to their percentage in the U.S. population.
I would suggest, however, that they are fairly represented in
relation to their percentage in the acting job market.</TE>
<TE>   One problem with attempting to track the progress of minorities on
TV is that many, if not most, of the "diversity studies" that are
released each year present a less-than-accurate picture of TV as a
whole. Most of these studies only score the three hours of nightly
prime-time programming offered by the big three networks (ABC, CBS
and NBC, and sometimes Fox), leaving out the daytime programming on
the big three and totally ignoring the other broadcast, cable and
Spanish-language networks.</TE>
<TE>   By concentrating mainly on the big three, which tend to skew much
of their prime-time programming toward the older, predominantly white
boomer audience, and by ignoring the other broadcast, cable and
Spanish-language networks (which get a larger combined audience share
than the big three in prime time, daytime and late-night
programming), these surveys appear predetermined to downplay the
presence of minority actors.</TE>
<TE>   The "landscape" of TV is becoming as diverse as the people who
traverse it. The big three networks may skew much of their
programming toward an older, white audience, but these days there are
channels that skew to blacks, Latinos, Asians, women and children.
There is even a channel in the works that will target gays. Now
that's true diversity.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing wrong with monitoring diversity on the major
broadcast networks. And, certainly, programming on the networks
should reflect the reality of American society. But studies with such
a narrow focus simply don't reflect America's viewing habits.
Minority activists often try to draw a correlation between the way
minorities are portrayed on TV and the attitudes toward minorities in
American society. But by not studying the shows that most Americans
are actually watching, such correlations are of very limited value
because of the vast amount of pertinent data that is ignored.</TE>
<TE>   I would respectfully suggest that the issue of TV diversity is
more complex than many of the activists and pressure groups make it
out to be. We must not allow that complexity to become submerged in a

<LD>The U.S. government, state judicial systems and Sun Microsystems are
apparently not the only foes troubling Bill Gates and Microsoft Corp.</LD>
<LD>   For nearly 20 years, a loosely affiliated group of computer
hackers and programmers, virtual Davids, if you will, have pooled
their talents and aimed their cyber-slingshots at techno-Goliath
Microsoft and its dominance of personal computer operating systems.</LD>
<LD>   In the process, they created the alternative operating system
Linux as well as the Open Source movement.</LD>
<TE>   Their story is told in J.T.S. Moore's new documentary, "Revolution
OS," part of Laemmle Theatres' Documentary Days 2002 weekend film
series.</TE>
<TE>   "I consciously set out to make a narrative about the movement,"
explains Moore. "It's first a character story, not a how-to or what
you can do on Linux or even why Microsoft and the Open Source
movement are opposing one another. Microsoft is the villain on the
horizon."</TE>
<TE>   The activists' enthusiasm was what initially drew Moore to the
subject. "They were so passionate, I thought there must be something
to it."</TE>
<TE>   Moore, serving as his own cinematographer, chose to shoot in wide
screen, a rare format for a documentary, because he felt the film's
classic-style narrative was well-served by the wide-screen treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The expense of the format forced Moore, who financed the film
himself, to be more disciplined in making the film, shaping the
structure as he went along.</TE>
<TE>   Featuring interviews with such figures as Linus Torvalds, who
created the Linux kernel--the missing piece of the puzzle in
developing a true alternative operating system--and Richard Stallman,
the founder of the Free Software movement, the film tells the story
of both the technology and the philosophies behind it.</TE>
<TE>   "Revolution OS" screens at 11 a.m. Saturday and Sunday at the
Monica 4-Plex in Santa Monica; May 4-5 at the Playhouse 7, Pasadena;
and May 18-19 at the Lido, Newport Beach.</TE>

<HD>Summer's Already Arrived</HD>
<DH>Box Office * With 'Scorpion King's' strong premiere, the
blockbuster- film season, which used to unofficially start in early
May, moves to April.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Summer movies are here. "The Scorpion King" blasted its way into
theaters like a hot July wind, scorching records for the month of
April with an estimated $36.2 million start in 3,443 theaters.</LD>
<LD>   Universal Pictures, which has effectively used late April to
launch such movies as "Life" and "U-571" in the past, decided to get
a two-week jump on the summer's first expected blockbuster
"Spiderman," which premieres May 3, according to studio distribution
chief Nikki Rocco. A similar strategy of opening high-profile films
during quiet box-office periods paid off earlier this year with "The
Ice Age" and "Blade II."</LD>
<LD>   With the successful launch of "The Scorpion King," the summer,
which used to unofficially start in early May, now seems to be moving
into April. (The previous highest grossing film over an April weekend
was "The Matrix," with just under $28 million.)</LD>
<TE>   The spinoff of "The Mummy" franchise, which has brought in more
than $800 million worldwide to date, stars wrestling superstar the
Rock, whose appeal to young boys (and the young at heart) was
confirmed by exit polls, which showed a slight edge (54% of ticket
buyers) toward younger (under 25) males, according to Rocco.
"Scorpion" was particularly strong with ethnic audiences and even
drew a healthy share of females (44% of the first weekend's
attendees). "We credit the production team with recognizing the
Rock's potential in 'Mummy Returns' and fashioning the movie to play
to his audience," says Universal Vice Chairman Marc Shmuger.</TE>
<TE>   "Scorpion King" was deliberately marketed to play up the action
elements of the film in contrast to "The Mummy's" special-effects
horror appeal. Universal is already planning a second "Scorpion" with
the Rock, though he will first star in an "Indiana Jones"-type
adventure, "Helldorado," also for Universal.</TE>
<TE>   Even though "Spiderman" is expected to blow away all competitors,
"Scorpion King" should enjoy two weeks with virtually no action
competition and could continue to do business as an alternate
attraction before the next "Star Wars" ups the summer stakes May 19,
according to Rocco.</TE>
<TE>   The only other arrival over the weekend was the Sandra Bullock
detective yarn "Murder by Numbers," which grossed a disappointing
$9.5 million in 2,663 theaters, unable to carve out a large enough
niche for itself against other similar movies such as "Changing
Lanes" and "High Crimes," both of which are already in theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Of the three films "Changing Lanes," which stars Ben Affleck and
Samuel L. Jackson, is attracting the largest audience. The
suspense-drama-cum-morality-tale fell a notch to second place with an
estimated $11.1 million over the weekend--an acceptable drop of
35%--and almost $33 million in its first 10 days. "High Crimes," with
Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman, fell to eighth place with a 50% drop
to about $2.8 million in its third weekend in 2,408 theaters and a
total of just under $31 million.</TE>
<TE>   Box-office totals for the top 12 films continued to improve on
last year, thanks to such consistent spring hits as "Panic Room,"
"The Rookie," "Blade II," and especially "Ice Age." According to
Exhibitor Relations, the 12 highest grossing films cornered an
estimated $93 million, a substantial 37% ahead of last year. Grosses
for the year to date are already 15% ahead of 2001, which indicates
an increased attendance level of about 10%, with the remainder
factored in for ticket-price inflation.</TE>
<TE>   After a month in theaters, the thriller "Panic Room" is in fifth
place, with a $6.2-million estimate and more than $82 million so far,
making it one of Jodie Foster's biggest hits alongside "Silence of
the Lambs" and "Contact."</TE>
<TE>   Two family films "The Rookie," starring Dennis Quaid and the
computer-animated "Ice Age" emerged as surprise hits over the past
couple of months.</TE>
<TE>   The former film, which is G-rated, continues to draw steady
business week after week, dropping a less-than-average 22% in its
fourth weekend for an estimated $6.3-million weekend gross and almost
$54 million to date.</TE>
<TE>   "Ice Age," however, is the season's blockbuster, and a major
victory for 20th Century Fox, which has had little previous success
in the animation field. The prehistoric tale is now in its sixth week
and still pulling in about $5.7 million as it nears $160 million, the
year's top-grossing film.</TE>
<TE>   Another family film that's showing good legs is "Clockstoppers,"
which grossed another $2.9 million or thereabouts in its fourth
weekend and almost $32 million to date.</TE>
<TE>   One of the spring's disappointments is the Cameron Diaz comedy
"The Sweetest Thing," which declined 45% in its second weekend in
2,670 theaters to a weak $5.2 million and only $17 million in 10
days. In 10th place is the similarly raunchy low-budget "National
Lampoon's Van Wilder," which brought in $2.2 million in its third
weekend for a good $17.3 million total so far.</TE>
<TE>   Among specialized films, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," premiered
over the weekend to modest reviews and about $550,000 on 108 screens.
The period piece "Triumph of Love" fared less well with $64,000
expected in 18 theaters. The independent "Divorce: The Musical,"
opened in one theater in L.A. to $8,356. And the Argentine heist
drama "Nine Queens" aced $41,000 in five screens.</TE>
<TE>   Of the longer running specialized films, "Y Tu Mama Tambien"
grossed more than $1 million again over the weekend on only 244
screens. The crossover Mexican hit is approaching the $6-million mark
and is expected to play well into early summer.</TE>

<DH>Plan for the L.A. Children's Museum captures what it means
to be young in an urban environment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a series of false starts and delays, the conceptual design for
a new Children's Museum downtown is complete. And it offers
compelling proof that bold, imaginative architecture is alive and
well in L.A.</LD>
<LD>   Designed by the Santa Monica-based Morphosis, the project is one
of two new buildings that will replace the original Children's Museum
of Los Angeles, which is currently housed in a cramped facility near
City Hall. The first of the new structures, designed by architect
Sarah Graham, is scheduled to open in 2003 in the San Fernando
Valley. Museum officials hope to open the downtown branch in 2005.</LD>
<LD>   The downtown project, however, still has several hurdles to clear
before it is built. The city recently postponed approval of the
project because of a dispute with the Los Angeles Police Department
over a proposed underground parking structure that would serve both
the museum and the LAPD's downtown headquarters. Meanwhile, members
of the local Japanese American community have been lobbying to change
the museum's location so they can build a recreation center on the
site.</LD>
<TE>   If the museum's site is approved, the building would mark a
significant addition to a growing arts district in Little Tokyo that
now includes the Japanese American National Museum and the Museum of
Contemporary Art's Geffen Contemporary. By far the most flamboyant
addition to this complex, the Children's Museum, with its dynamic,
machine-like forms, acts as a sophisticated teaching instrument
offering stunning glimpses into L.A.'s urban future.</TE>
<TE>   The structure would stand at the corner of Temple and Judge John
Aiso streets, forming a V that would frame a courtyard overlooking
the nearby arts complex. The bulk of the museum would be set along
Temple. Its faceted white form, bulging slightly at its center, would
be propped on spindly, canted columns at one end. The administrative
offices, cafe and bookstore would stretch along Judge John Aiso
Street.</TE>
<TE>   Thom Mayne, Morphosis' principal designer, conceived the building
as a series of folding planes, like an origami sculpture. The
museum's anthropomorphic form recalls the work of Archigram, a
British architecture group formed in the 1960s that was deeply
inspired by Los Angeles' informal Pop landscape. Like Archigram's
theoretical "Walking City"--a gigantic urban machine that resembles a
mechanical buffalo--the children's museum looks as if it could stand
up and walk across the city, an obvious reference to L.A.'s mobile
culture.</TE>
<TE>   But Morphosis' design is also firmly rooted in its context.
Visitors would approach the museum's main courtyard from a planned
3-acre park that would extend from the Geffen Contemporary on the
east to Judge John Aiso Street on the west and the Japanese American
National Museum on the south.</TE>
<TE>   A long, low wall, covered in climbing vines, would separate the
courtyard from the park. The bookstore and cafe would be framed by an
enormous glass structural wall used to display the building's cooling
system, with water cascading down its interior surface onto a system
of coils. On the courtyard's other side, grand stairs would lead to
an elevated triangular plaza and playground.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a subtle hierarchy of public and semipublic zones.
The park outside would be part of the adult world; the courtyard and
elevated plaza would be more secure--the realm of the child. By
linking the two, Mayne is able to set up a tension between the need
for security and the desire to explore outer worlds.</TE>
<TE>   That sense of tension continues inside the museum plan. Its most
dramatic space is a towering seven-story atrium that carves up
through the core of the museum, with galleries set on either side.
Visitors ride a series of over-scaled elevators to the top. From
there, long ramps switch back and forth across the atrium among the
various exhibition areas.</TE>
<TE>   The configuration of the galleries is reminiscent of Frank Lloyd
Wright's Guggenheim Museum in New York. But though Wright's spiraling
galleries offer a smooth, uninterrupted circulation route, Mayne's
plan is intentionally jarring. Set apart from the ramps, the
galleries would vary in size, giving each a distinct identity.</TE>
<TE>   The ramps, meanwhile, would pierce the building's exterior at
various levels before switching back into the building, offering
radically divergent views of the city. Near the top, one would
overlook the courtyard and surrounding art museums. Lower, two ramps
would break through the building's Temple Street facade, overlooking
a sweeping landscape of low-rise industrial buildings. The Twin
Towers jail looms in the distance. A rehabilitation center is visible
across the street.</TE>
<TE>   Mayne has described the ramps in metaphorical terms. "We wanted
the kids to feel as if they could misbehave," he says, "to give them
the chance to break the rules of the typical museum."</TE>
<TE>   But the relationship between inner and outer worlds also implies a
more complex reading of our relationship to urban life.</TE>
<TE>   In temporarily drawing the child outside of the cloistered world
of the exhibition galleries, Mayne is hinting that knowledge attains
meaning only when rooted in real experience. For better or worse,
culture, beauty, violence and poverty are all part of that urban
tapestry.</TE>
<TE>   These are not new themes in Mayne's work. In his 1999 design for
the International Elementary School in Long Beach, which is also
situated in a gritty, urban neighborhood, Mayne took great care to
provide a safe haven for learning, folding the school around an
enclosed central court. But he also placed the playground on the
roof, where students are exposed to a sweeping view of the
surrounding community. A more recent design for a Caltrans' district
headquarters building, scheduled to break ground this spring across
from City Hall, will allow the public to flow into the building via a
large open-air atrium.</TE>
<TE>   Such projects reflect Mayne's keen understanding of Los Angeles'
evolving identity. Once emblematic of suburban sprawl, a city of
homogenous enclaves bound by its freeways, the city is becoming
increasingly dense. In the process, it is struggling to identify new
ways to bind Los Angeles into a cohesive urban whole.</TE>
<TE>   The design of the Children's Museum achieves those aims without
turning its back on Los Angeles' singular identity--its strange
ephemerality, its unusual blend of man-made and natural landscapes.
It does so by embracing the complexity of urban experience just
enough to pique the child's natural curiosity.</TE>
<TE>   These are ideas the city needs. If only the city would get around
to building them.</TE>

<HD>'Dateline' to Mark 10th Anniversary</HD>
<DH>Television * Despite the early scandal that racked its
leadership, the newsmagazine is thriving.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID BAUDER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Taking over at "Dateline NBC" shortly after the fallout from a fake
truck crash swept out his predecessor, executive producer Neal
Shapiro called a staff meeting to find out what stories were ready
for upcoming shows.</LD>
<LD>   Well, came the reply, there's a report on the Internal Revenue
Service.</LD>
<LD>   And ... that was it. The cupboard was bare.</LD>
<TE>   Shapiro knew he had to move fast simply to fill time.</TE>
<TE>   Given that disastrous start, it's a small miracle that "Dateline
NBC" is around to celebrate a 10th anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   It has not only survived, but thrived. The newsmagazine, with Jane
Pauley and Stone Phillips as hosts, will mark the moment with a
special at 10 p.m. Tuesday filled with highlights from its past.</TE>
<TE>   It's a long psychic distance from the first season, when producers
staged a collision to illustrate fire dangers in a General Motors
truck. The scandal brought down an NBC News president as well as the
"Dateline" leadership.</TE>
<TE>   The lingering memory of that incident is one of the things that
prevents journalists from giving "Dateline" the same respect accorded
"60 Minutes" and "20/20." That's always rankled people at NBC.</TE>
<TE>   "It gets the respect from the viewers," said Shapiro, now NBC News
president. "'Dateline' can show up at any time slot, promoted or
unpromoted, and it gets viewers."</TE>
<TE>   "Dateline NBC," which now airs three nights a week, is NBC News'
most profitable show after "Today" and helped elevate Shapiro, its
executive producer for eight years, to his new job.</TE>
<TE>   One of the show's signatures is its unpredictability, he said. An
interview with Liza Minnelli about her marriage, a two-hour "true
crime" story about a high school gang that called itself the Lords of
Chaos and an award-winning investigation into insurance fraud can all
fit under its wide umbrella.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so fluid," said Robert Thompson, director of the Center for
the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University. "It can go
from these stories that are really goofy ... to good, solid
investigative journalism.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost as if 'Dateline' is the perpetual Trojan horse," he
said. "It keeps using its legitimacy as a newsmagazine to sneak in
cheesy stories and at the same time, it uses its
entertainment-oriented cheesiness to sneak in serious stories."</TE>
<TE>   The success ended NBC's fruitless search over many years for a
newsmagazine franchise. Seventeen previous attempts ended in failure.</TE>

<HD>Not Mrs. What's His Name</HD>
<DH>Movies* Clare Peploe, married to filmmaker Bernardo
Bertolucci, is a director in her own right. Her 'Triumph of Love' was
released last week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCARLET CHENG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I saw this production in London," Clare Peploe says of a stage
version of "The Triumph of Love" mounted two years ago. "It was the
last day, and I thought, 'I'm not able to tell any of my friends to
go and see it.' It's so extraordinary! So I had to make a film of
it."</LD>
<LD>   Soon afterward, Peploe, known for directing two romantic comedies
of expatriates washed up on exotic shores ("High Season" and "Rough
Magic"), brought it up as a possible project with her husband,
Bernardo Bertolucci. He just happened to be looking for something
that could be shot in Italy--the Italian government was offering
special funding if he did so. That wasn't too difficult--the 18th
century French play by Pierre Marivaux was easily relocated, at least
physically, to Tuscany, though it remains a mannered set piece of the
French Enlightenment.</LD>
<LD>   Peploe was especially attracted to the main character, the
beautiful young Princess (Mira Sorvino), who willfully schemes her
way into the affections of her chosen love object, Agis (Jay Rodan),
and, in the process, upends the rational household in which he
resides. "I find it very fast and funny and cerebral," says Peploe,
in her late 50s, during a visit to Los Angeles. The filmmaker, a
lean, handsome woman with medium-length blond hair, is one to choose
her words carefully, although every so often she reveals a surprising
candor.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought the main character a very modern character, the way she
negotiates emotions, feelings, and her political strategy--like a
career thing," Peploe says. "I found it had some parallels with young
women nowadays. She's a very, very strong character and has to be
very focused and has to be very smart in dealing with situations."
The film opened Wednesday in Los Angeles and New York to mixed
reviews and will get a limited release in other cities in the next
few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   With Peploe's background, the mix and match of time and place was
more natural than incongruous. Born in Tanzania, she was raised in
Kenya, then England and Italy. Her parents were inclined toward the
arts--her father an art dealer and her mother a painter.</TE>
<TE>   As a child, she was impressed by the movies, though for a long
time she saw only one genre, the American western. "I'd only seen
westerns, which I loved," she recalls. "My mother took me to westerns
because they had beautiful landscapes." Later, when she was doing
pre-university study at Oxford, older friends introduced her to
French New Wave and American film noir. She was struck by "this other
language, another way of filmmaking."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of staying in England, Peploe went to study in France and
Italy. She got into the film business "by being friends with
filmmakers in Italy, which was always my second country." In 1969,
she got a job with Michelangelo Antonioni as "the umpteenth
assistant" for a film about rebellious youth in the United States,
"Zabriskie Point," now a cult classic. Because she knew English and
had traveled in the United States, Peploe was thought an asset to the
production and was later given a screenplay credit--along with Sam
Shepard and three others--although today she pooh-poohs that. "I
wasn't really a writer on it, I was a researcher on it."</TE>
<TE>   In 1970, she met Bertolucci at a screening of his film "The
Spider's Stratagem," and in 1977, she served as his assistant on
"1900." The two married in 1979, and she's continued to be his
sometime collaborator, including screenwriter and associate producer
for the 1998 well-received art-house film "Besieged."</TE>
<TE>   A 1981 Short Film and Then a Feature</TE>
<TE>   She became a director through unusual circumstances. "I was almost
forced into it," she says with a laugh. "I was always giving advice.
I think Bernardo got fed up with me, and he said, 'Why don't you just
direct a film yourself?'"</TE>
<TE>   So she did. In 1981, she made a 30-minute short, "Couples and
Robbers," which earned Oscar and British Academy nominations. Six
years later, she made her first feature, "High Season," about the
shenanigans of British expatriates on a Greek island overrun by mass
tourism. The film mixed surrealism and film noir--and, to some
critics, not particularly successfully.</TE>
<TE>   But she wasn't deterred.</TE>
<TE>   She made "Rough Magic" (1995) with Bridget Fonda and Russell
Crowe, in which Fonda plays an American in search of a secret elixir
from a Mexican shaman and Crowe a tough-talking gumshoe put on her
trail by her jilted fiance.</TE>
<TE>   Peploe also co-wrote "Besieged," directed by Bertolucci. She had
fallen in love with the original story, James Lasdun's "The Siege,"
and failing in her own efforts to get the financing to make it into a
movie, she encouraged her husband to take on this sweet love story--a
departure from his usual grim take on love and sex (witness "Last
Tango in Paris"). "It was quite liberating for him to do that," she
says. In "Besieged," a British expatriate (David Thewlis) living in
Rome falls for his housekeeper, an African medical student (Thandie
Newton), and ends up giving nearly everything for her.</TE>
<TE>   As a filmmaker, Peploe recognizes that being married to an
internationally acclaimed director is a mixed blessing. In the past,
she has rued the fact that since she is married to Bertolucci, people
assume that she has ready access to production funding--not true.
However, with "Triumph of Love," her husband produced the
$4.5-million film and helped get the Italian government to partially
finance it.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting in Paris, 'Mira Seduced Me'</TE>
<TE>   Casting the role of the Princess was, of course, key. It called
for a young actress who could convincingly convey cocky charm and
warmheartedness. Early on, Peploe had a meeting with Sorvino--they
met at a Paris cafe. "Mira seduced me, practically," says Peploe,
smiling. "She was so convincing and her accent so flawless."</TE>
<TE>   Sorvino had to assume a British accent to go with that of other
major cast members, including the stern brother-sister pair the
Princess must win over. Ben Kingsley was cast as the philosopher
Hermocrates, and Fiona Shaw as the scientific Leontine.</TE>
<TE>   "I take great care about getting the right cast so that I don't
have to waste time having to go over and make someone understand how
to do something," says Peploe. "The amount of ideas my actors give
me--great ideas!" Kingsley, for example, was the one who suggested
that Hermocrates, despite his ascetic principles, was really quite
vain, so he should be dressed in richly colorful costumes.</TE>
<TE>   Kingsley said he admired Peploe's "pure intuitive enthusiasm for
the story she's telling." Her method, he says, was to use "tiny
little adjustments and suggestions, not even telling you what to do
next. For the next take you may be even closer to what you need at
that point in the story."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, working with her husband as producer wasn't
always easy for Peploe. "He was around a lot, getting terribly
anxious," she recalls. As a good producer, he fretted about schedules
and budgets and even elements that might not go over with a general
audience. "Like these modern theater moments, Bernardo was a little
worried as a producer, but as a director he loved them," she says.
"So I appealed to that side of him."</TE>
<TE>   Though the form of the story is a farce--and the film takes glee
in its theatricality--Peploe believes in its underlying, more serious
message. "Really, what the story is saying is that if you haven't
really experienced love, you can't understand human nature," she
says. "No matter how humiliating or painful or ridiculous that can
be."</TE>

<HD>A Tour de Force for Versatile Terry Riley All-Stars</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Terry Riley and the All-Stars sounds like the name of a jazz band
(remember Louis Armstrong and the All-Stars?), and actually, that
impression is not far off the mark. But there is a lot more going on
in the music of this quartet than just jazz--or minimalism, for that
matter.</LD>
<LD>   For Riley's free-thinking All-Stars, who made their Los Angeles
debut at Schoenberg Hall on Saturday night, boundaries have
disappeared altogether; everything was fair game to be thrown into
these melanges of composed and improvised music.</LD>
<LD>   In Riley's piano playing, you might detect modern jazz chords or
Spanish harmonic vamps, right-hand solos steeped in Indian raga
principles, and in the inimitably titled "Goodbye Goodtimes Blues for
Millenium's Child," some rather stolid yet unmistakable stride piano.
In "Nur Dendia" and "Missi Gono," Riley also sang in a gravelly voice
oddly reminiscent of another great jazz-influenced composer-pianist,
Antonio Carlos Jobim.</LD>
<TE>   George Brooks provided the strongest jazz strain on tenor and
soprano saxophones, while Turtle Island String Quartet alumnus Tracy
Silverman filled several roles, at times processing his electric
viola so that it sounded like a cello or an electric guitar with a
wah-wah pedal.</TE>
<TE>   In a featured spot, Silverman and guitarist Gyan Riley (Terry's
son) played three duets from "Cantos Desiertos" that passed through
flamenco, tango and North Indian territory.</TE>
<TE>   Every piece was stamped with Riley's flowing, life-affirming
signature, exploring musical hills and dales like a rambling road
trip through his native Gold Country, meaning sometimes taking abrupt
turns down different lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, Riley creates unity from all of this diversity--a lesson
to us all.</TE>

<LD>It has been said that youth is wasted on the young. Not in the case
of the dozens of fresh young dancers who took to the stage over the
weekend at Los Angeles Theatre Center, as Dance 2K2, a celebration of
national dance month, ended with a wallop.</LD>
<LD>   Friday night saw Monica DeYampert's 45-minute movement
extravaganza, set to the music of Prince, with 17 dancers wildly
gyrating and frenetically performing fouettes barefoot. Edge Dance
Company--students of Edge Performing Arts Center, with choreography
by Edge's staff--upped the adrenaline ante with six numbers ranging
from "Footloose" to "Le Jazz Hot." Tapper Ryan Lohoff blew the roof
off with his syncopated solo, "Smooth Criminal."</LD>
<LD>   Modern dance was also well represented, giving both evenings a
serious dose of beauty and depth: Kitty McNamee's Hysterica Dance
Company offered six pieces of intense technique coupled with highly
charged emotions on Friday. Highlights included excerpts from two
works in progress: "Red Wagon" and "The Sun (Part 1)," lyrical duets
with strong, sexy partnering.</LD>
<TE>   On Saturday, Donna Sternberg and Dancers served up two works, "La
Loba" and "Skittering," the former a feral trio based on a wolf woman
tale, the latter an extended, albeit overly long, riff with lots of
yoga-based moves, slouching and, well, skittering across the stage.</TE>
<TE>   Winifred R. Harris' Between Lines troupe presented a trio of
previously seen works, including "Interrogation," in which fluid
balancing feats on red metal chairs mesmerized the audience.</TE>
<TE>   And what would a Los Angeles dance festival be without the
jubilant stylings of Danza Folkloricanto/USA? Under the stellar
direction of Gema Sandoval, this beaming company brought the regional
dances of Mexico to life with six ebullient works. Characterized by
breezy line formations, rhythmic stamping and swirling skirts, the
dozen dancers were as frothy as cotton candy.</TE>

<LD>"If you're looking to get your 'Purple Rain' on in here, you've come
to the wrong party," Prince told his Kodak Theatre audience Friday
during a concert largely emphasizing his current jazz-flavored album,
"The Rainbow Children."</LD>
<LD>   Yeah, right.</LD>
<LD>   By the end of the sexy 'n' satisfying, almost three-hour show, the
first of two consecutive nights, the veteran performer and his
stellar quintet definitely hadn't played as many hits as at his 2001
Hollywood Palladium appearance. But he did do "Purple Rain," while
bathed in lavender light, no less. Not that the crowd of mostly
die-hard fans would have complained if he didn't. And why should
they?</LD>
<TE>   In recent years, Prince has devoted himself to his followers and
all but shut out the outside world. But where once that seemed the
result of his having lost the plot, on Friday the perfectly executed
new material, along with everything else, made his
self-marginalization more a real shame for pop. For he hasn't lost a
step artistically and still has things to teach.</TE>
<TE>   In a streamlined presentation, sans last year's backing vocalists
and dancer, he sang beautifully and poured on the funky-to-bluesy,
hard-to-delicate, Hendrix-esque guitar solos and intricate,
expressive keyboard work. Even the esoteric religious mythology that
made "Rainbow" so cumbersome was thankfully overshadowed by the
innovative, often heavy and slightly distorted soul-jazz-funk.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a hot-pink suit, Prince soaked up the love, joyously
leading the band through on-a-dime changes, playfully interacting
with fans, and commenting on such concerns as slavery, radio
consolidation and racial profiling. And when he did offer such
favorites as "Raspberry Beret" and "When You Were Mine," they were
full renditions, rather than the snippets heard in previous
performances. Which made those moments even sweeter.</TE>

<HD>Chamber Heads East on an Eclectic Note</HD>
<DH>The L.A. orchestra offers a preview of tour concert that
ranges from a Bach cantata solo to pieces by Haydn and Ginastera.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About to head East this week on a tour highlighted by an appearance
in Carnegie Hall, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra has not packed
lightly or neatly. In a preview concert at the Alex Theatre on
Saturday, it crammed a program full to the bursting point.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning with one of Haydn's last, loudest, funniest and most
accomplished symphonies, Jeffrey Kahane went on to conduct a
death-transcending Bach cantata for solo baritone, exquisitely
melancholic songs by Ravel and a neglected 20th century orchestral
showpiece by the Argentine composer Alberto Ginastera.</LD>
<LD>   The soloist, and clearly a major attraction for the tour, was the
baritone, Thomas Quasthoff, who also managed to fit in an encore of
"Ol' Man River." On the road, Quasthoff will replace three brief
Ravel songs with another Bach cantata, "Ich habe genug" (It is
enough), three times as long as the Ravel. But even without this
additional transcendental cantata, there was quite enough Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps succumbing to the law of diminishing returns, Haydn's
Symphony No. 102, as overambitious curtain-raiser, made the least
impression in a tidy performance that managed to be frisky without
being particularly amusing. Things could go better elsewhere, given
that the Alex has a dry, uninvolving acoustic, and it can take time
for the audience to settle into the music. The slow movement, one of
Haydn's loveliest, was, however, graciously played.</TE>
<TE>   Even Quasthoff made an awkward first impression. Bach's cantata,
"Ich will den Kreuzstab gerne tragen" (I will bear the cross with
gladness), begins in torment of physical suffering, with the composer
quickly wiping away the tears as the music miraculously reveals the
heavenly comfort and liberation of death. It is possible that the
German baritone, who has miraculously transcended his own physical
limitations by having become one of the most convincing singers
before the public, was attempting to overcompensate for the Alex's
acoustic when he at first showed unusual strain in the upper
registers.</TE>
<TE>   But as the music became more comforting, so did he seem more
comfortable. And in the second aria, in which the liberated soul
soars like an eagle, the thrill was back as an ecstatic Quasthoff
rode on the contrapuntal wings of Allan Vogel's oboe solo.</TE>
<TE>   Opening the second half of the program with Ravel's three short,
wistful songs, "Don Quichotte a Dulcinee," the composer's last music,
Quasthoff was in full command of every tonal and textural nuance. He
slightly overplays the drunkenness of the third song, in which the
lovelorn Spanish knight loses himself in drink, but it works
nonetheless. There was a lightness here that, in ways I'm not sure I
understand, managed to pick up where Bach left off. And, in ways I
understand even less, Quasthoff, coming dangerously close to
affectation with his jazz inflections, made "Ol' Man River" a
goose-bump-raising culmination of all the emotion in Bach and Ravel.</TE>
<TE>   The last time Kahane and his orchestra attempted the "Variaciones
Concertantes"--Ginastera's characterful 1953 series of variations
written in a national Argentine style on a haunting extended melody
for solo cello--was at L.A. Chamber Orchestra's 30th anniversary
concert in 1998. The performance was rough. This time it was
splendid, its tone set by the rich sound of cellist Douglas Davis,
and culminating in a furious and fabulous swirl of energy for the
ending gaucho dance. Let's hope that East Coast audiences will be
patient as the chamber orchestra unpacks its bulging suitcases.</TE>

<HD>Fishing for Answers on Earth Day</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are plenty of fish in the sea, or so we are told. It's sound
advice for the lovelorn but a bad assumption for anyone tempted to
take that old saw literally on this, the 32nd anniversary of Earth
Day. Tonight's "Empty Oceans, Empty Nets" (10 p.m. KCET, KVCR)
examines the disturbing decline of marine fisheries around the world
through case studies in New England, the Canary Islands, the
Mediterranean and Alaska.</LD>
<LD>   In its simplest form, the problem comes down to catching fish
faster than they can reproduce. But behind that basic premise lies a
complex web of factors. They include destructive fishing practices,
improved technology, the globalization of the seafood market,
overpopulation, changing consumer tastes and governmental policies.
"Overfishing isn't happening because fishermen are greedy or they
don't know when to stop," says Suzanne Iudicello, author of "The
Economics of Overfishing" and one of the many experts interviewed.
"It happens because all the incentives are there for it to happen."</LD>
<LD>   The good news is that fish populations can be restored and
sustained through careful regulation of fishing. Consumers can also
become more aware of which kinds of fish are best to buy, shunning
those listed as commercially endangered.</LD>
<TE>   Yet despite the documentary's thoughtful message, it's not always
easy to watch. The film is laced with the unvarnished reality of fish
dying or being gaffed, a bloody ordeal. And if these scenes are meant
to stir, the rest of this hourlong production is so deliberate and
fact-laden that the overall effect is to sedate rather than agitate.</TE>

<HD>Abortion Pill Under Scrutiny After Deaths</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six women who took the abortion pill mifepristone have become ill and
two of them have died, although no direct link has been established
between the medication and their illnesses, according to the
manufacturer and the Food and Drug Administration.</LD>
<LD>   Danco Laboratories of New York last week sent a letter about the
cases to all doctors, clinics and hospitals that prescribe the pill,
Mifeprex (formerly known as RU-486), which is given with the drug
misoprostol. The letter, which the FDA posted on the Internet,
reminded them to report any serious adverse effects such as death,
hospitalization or blood transfusion.</LD>
<LD>   Three of the women suffered ruptures of their ectopic pregnancies,
which typically occur in the Fallopian tubes instead of the uterus.
Such pregnancies, which make up about 2% of all pregnancies, should
be carefully ruled out before prescribing the two-drug regimen, Danco
reminded doctors. One of the three women died from excessive
bleeding.</LD>
<TE>   Two other women developed serious bacterial infections, one with a
rare bacterium called Clostridium sordellii. That woman died,
although neither the company nor the FDA believes that the drug
regimen played a role in either case. Such body-wide infections have
in the past been associated with menstruation, childbirth,
miscarriage and abortion, but "we do not believe that Mifeprex and
misoprostol present a special risk of infection," the company wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The sixth woman, a 21-year-old, suffered a heart attack but later
recovered. FDA officials continue to review her case. Women who take
the two-drug regimen first take mifepristone, which interferes with a
fetus' attachment to a woman's body, followed by misoprostol to cause
contractions. The contractions help expel the fetus.</TE>
<TE>   The abortion pill was first used in France. Doctors there
initially paired it with a different drug to cause contractions, but
after that drug was associated with heart attacks, it was replaced
with misoprostol. The latter drug hasn't been linked to heart
trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Mifepristone hit the U.S. market 17 months ago, when the FDA
approved its use within the first seven weeks of pregnancy; Danco
began shipping it in November 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Danco spokeswoman Heather O'Neill declined to say how many U.S.
women have used it, adding that the information is proprietary. She
characterized the six cases as "an extremely small incidence relative
to the overall use."</TE>
<TE>   She warned women taking the drug that the biggest clue that
something could be wrong "is the absence of response to the regimen."
Most users will begin to bleed and complete the pregnancy termination
four to 24 hours after taking misoprostol; bleeding typically is
heavier than a normal period.</TE>
<TE>   According to an FDA official who spoke on condition of anonymity,
the agency worked with the company to draft the letter advising
doctors about the cases, but "there was no urgency on the part of the
agency to think the Mifeprex was dangerous, or that any action needed
to be urgently taken."</TE>
<TE>   According to "Mifepristone Questions and Answers" that the FDA
posted on its Web site, the women who became ill received the
misoprostol vaginally, instead of in pill form, and "the FDA has not
reviewed data on the safety and effectiveness of vaginal
administration of misoprostol." The agency also said that it didn't
know "what role, if any, Mifeprex and 'off-label' use of vaginal
misoprostol may have in developing serious infections."</TE>
<TE>   Abortion opponents said the safety alert highlights the dangers of
nonsurgical abortions. "The FDA approved RU-486 under intense
political pressure, and now women are suffering the consequences,"
said Wendy Wright, senior political director of Concerned Women for
America. "We warned the public that this would happen when the drug
was approved. RU-486 is harmful to women."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters maintain that nonsurgical abortion with the pill is
still a safer alternative to surgical abortion. "This remains a very
safe and effective way to terminate an early pregnancy," said Vicki
Saporta, president and chief executive of the National Abortion
Federation.</TE>

<HD>Medicare's Changes Merit a Close Watch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB ROSENBLATT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many consumers will need a scorecard to keep up with the rapid
changes occurring in Medicare this year, and the latest revisions
offer mixed news for 35 million Americans enrolled in the giant
federal medical plan.</LD>
<LD>   On one hand, the government is expanding coverage this year for
some people with serious health problems, such as cancer and
diabetes, and renewing efforts to reach low-income individuals who
need help paying Medicare premiums. It is also promising to remove
some hurdles that were making it difficult for people with
Alzheimer's disease to access medical care. But other changes will
make it more difficult for Medicare enrollees to switch back and
forth between the traditional Medicare program and HMOs.</LD>
<LD>   The coverage changes are being led by Tom Scully, director of the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, who has announced a drive
"to make the latest effective technology available" to Medicare
recipients. If successful, the effort will assure that people
enrolled in Medicare, many of whom live on modest fixed budgets, will
have available the same state-of-the-art equipment and treatments
found in the best private health insurance plans.</LD>
<TE>   One key change is that Medicare will begin paying for major,
sophisticated diagnostic tools for the detection of breast cancer,
which strikes 90,000 Medicare beneficiaries a year. The program will
cover Positron Emission Tomography, or PET, a scanning system that
shows cross-sectional images of biological activity in tumors or
lesions. It can detect the disease when X-rays appear to be normal.
The technology gives patients and doctors "potentially lifesaving
information not provided by traditional imaging," said Health and
Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   Medicare also will cover the cost of "image guidance," which uses
ultrasound to determine where to insert a needle for a biopsy of the
breast. The ultrasound technique is a less-invasive alternative to
surgical biopsy, in which a piece of tissue is surgically removed.
Another change is that Medicare, which normally excludes coverage for
routine foot care, will now pay for two foot exams a year for
diabetics. The coverage will be available to people who have
peripheral neuropathy, a nerve condition limiting the ability to feel
the pains that might signal a foot injury. Many diabetics have
undetected foot injuries that sometimes lead to amputations.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Medicare will now pay for consultations with professional
dietitians for patients suffering from diabetes or kidney disease.
The dietitians will prepare an individual diet plan for patients and
chart their progress. "This is very important for diabetics because
of their problems with metabolizing carbohydrates, and for patients
with renal diseases for eliminating proteins from the body,'' said
Dr. Jeffrey Kang, the CMS chief clinical officer. "Both conditions
cause damage to other parts of the body if not controlled."</TE>
<TE>   Another important new policy forbids discrimination in services
for those with Alzheimer's disease. Families had long complained that
Alzheimer's patients were being denied services such as occupational
therapy or speech therapy. Someone who suffered a stroke, for
example, might need help in relearning to walk or speak. Someone who
had a hip replacement might need help in walking again. Some local
insurance carriers in different regions of the country were denying
these services on the grounds that Alzheimer's patients, having lost
their mental acuity, could not benefit from the rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   After years of complaints, the federal government decided this was
discriminatory and ruled that all patients, regardless of their
medical condition, are entitled to all services covered by Medicare.
Many Medicare beneficiaries have low incomes and are eligible for
financial help from the federal government. About 13% of the
beneficiaries--about 4.6 million people--have incomes below the
federal poverty line: $8,860 for an individual, and $11,940 for a
couple.</TE>
<TE>   All are eligible for free Medicare services. And partial help with
Medicare expenses is available to millions more on the Medicare
rolls, depending on their incomes and assets.</TE>
<TE>   But these assistance programs are not well-known--fewer than a
quarter of those eligible are enrolled. The government aims to change
that. In May, the Social Security Administration will begin sending
up to 18 million letters to those who might be entitled to aid.</TE>
<TE>   Eligibility is linked to income and assets. The Qualified Medicare
Beneficiary, or QMB, program is open to those individuals with
incomes up to $739 a month and financial resources (stocks, bonds,
savings accounts) of $4,000 or less. A couple can have an income up
to $995 a month and assets up to $6,000.</TE>
<TE>   If you qualify, the government will cover your cost-sharing
expenses under Medicare, all co-payments and deductibles (such as
$812 for the first day in the hospital, and 20 co-payments for
approved services by doctors). It also will cover the $54 a month
premium you pay for Part B coverage for doctor bills. In effect, all
your Medicare costs will be covered and you will have no
out-of-pocket expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The Specified Low-income Medicare Beneficiary, or SLMB, program is
available to individuals with income up to $886 a month, and couples
with income up to $1,194 monthly. The asset test is the same as for
QMB, a limit of $4,000 for an individual and $6,000 for a couple.</TE>
<TE>   This program will cover the cost of the Part B premium, the $54 a
month each beneficiary pays. The monthly premium is deducted from
Social Security benefit checks.</TE>
<TE>   When someone qualifies for QMB or SLMB, the premium is no longer
deducted from the Social Security benefit payment. Information on
these programs, as well as other Medicare activities, is available
from the Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy program, operated
by the California Department of Aging. The statewide number is (800)
434-0222. The Web site is www.cahealthadvocates.org. The Medicare
Rights Center in New York also operates a helpful Web site at
www.medicarerights.org.</TE>
<TE>   Another important change--and something new in Medicare's
history--begins July 1. No more switching from one HMO to another,
from regular Medicare to an HMO, or from an HMO back to regular
Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   The ability to switch has always been a safety valve for Medicare
beneficiaries, especially those who are frail and suffer chronic,
expensive health problems.</TE>
<TE>   Traditional Medicare gave them unrestricted selection of doctors
and hospitals. But the HMOs offered extra benefits such as no
co-payments or deductibles, and most important, prescription drugs,
which are not covered by Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   Congress decided in 1997 to make changes in the Medicare program
to make it resemble regular health insurance, and ordered a reduction
in the ability to move freely among health plans. Medicare enrollees
had been allowed to move in and out of plans on a monthly basis.</TE>
<TE>   The potential impact will be felt most heavily in California,
where a third of Medicare beneficiaries belong to HMOs, contrasted
with 14% nationally.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if an HMO indicated it would not cover a procedure or
surgery sought by a member, the individual could return to
traditional Medicare, and find a doctor who would perform surgery and
accept Medicare reimbursement.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a huge change," said Aileen Harper, associate director at
the Center for Health Care Rights, a Los Angeles consumer advocacy
group. She worries that many beneficiaries don't realize they can no
longer switch.</TE>
<TE>   The rules will be even more strict next year. During open
enrollment in November of this year, beneficiaries must choose a
health plan for 2003. They will be allowed to make one switch between
Jan. 1 and March 30, but will be locked in for the rest of the year.</TE>

<LD>Today, folks at UCLA will bury a small, cone-shaped container to
commemorate the university's new replacement hospital in Westwood,
currently under construction. If the officials' self-restraint is
anything like mine, they'll be digging it up next week--but the idea
is to wait until the year 2030, fully 25 years after the hospital
opens. Then, with much pomp and circumstance, they'll open it and
probably giggle at some of the odd, old-fashioned items it contains.</LD>
<LD>   Like a sigmoidoscope--a foot-long snakelike item currently used to
check colons for precancerous polyps. ("They used to do what?!" those
future fresh-faced interns will shriek.)</LD>
<LD>   Like a hospital bill. (Who wants to guess what a hospital aspirin
tablet or bandage will cost in 2030?)</LD>
<TE>   And like breast implants--both the silicone and saline kind.
(Aesthetic medicine being what it is, we can't begin to predict the
future of fake breasts. Who would have predicted 25 years ago that
people would be getting together to eat and drink and jab their faces
with bacterial toxins?)</TE>
<TE>   Frances Ridlehoover, UCLA Medical Center's chief operating
officer, says the staff was asked to contribute items that have been
significant in medicine but that also reflect how rapidly medicine is
changing. And the items poured in. Prosthetic limbs. An artificial
heart. Nurses' paystubs. Masks and gloves and psychiatric drugs like
Prozac and Zoloft--which may be the best we've got today but could
easily seem like bashing a malfunctioning computer with a hammer in
those far-off days of the future when we know lots more about the
brain.</TE>
<TE>   Also stuffed into the drum are doctors' all-important pagers (how
quaint they will seem when everyone in the hospital is networked into
a big, buzzing medical hive) and patient identity bracelets, which
will be obsolete when people all have chips embedded under their skin
like my pal's pedigree dog does.</TE>
<TE>   In, too, are the latest protocols for treating people with
HIV--and wouldn't it be nice, says Ridlehoover, if that item was the
most antiquated of them all.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-five years mightn't seem long enough for things to change
much--but you get an idea of what can happen by looking back 25. None
of us had ever heard of AIDS. The hepatitis C virus hadn't been
identified, and because of that doctors couldn't screen for it. At
the time, the risk of getting hepatitis from a blood transfusion was
as high as one in 10 in some parts of the country, says Dr. Douglas
Blackall, co-director of transfusion medicine at the hospital. "Now
that risk is conservatively one in a million: What a change!"</TE>
<TE>   Blackall and colleagues contributed blood donor pins for the
capsule, among other things. He thinks that long before 25 years are
up we'll have fine red blood cell substitutes but we'll still need
donors for things such as platelets and plasma.</TE>
<TE>   Julia Benoit, a registered nurse and unit director of medical
procedures, says a lot too has changed in gastroenterology, her own
specialty. These days, there's more talk of colon cancer prevention,
she says--of diet and exercise and getting one's colon thoroughly
examined in midlife.</TE>
<TE>   That's why she offered the sigmoidoscope for the capsule.
Actually, there's already a movement toward routinely using a 4-foot
long device, the colonoscope, for such screening. (But the time
capsule's of limited size, and we don't want to shock future
generations too much.)</TE>
<TE>   As for what we can expect in the future, Benoit has seen fanciful
scenarios painted before--and they've seemed pretty unlikely to her.
At a conference a few years back, "they showed this anatomical
drawing of a colon and a little thing with wheels on it that looked
like a bulldozer--and they were talking about this little device
going in and snipping off polyps," she says. "I remember thinking:
'That'll never happen.'"</TE>
<TE>   But Benoit is rethinking this because, already, some UCLA patients
swallow little pill-shaped cameras that meander down the entire gut
snapping photos before coming out the other end.</TE>
<TE>   And scientists are working hard at perfecting "virtual
colonoscopies" that would allow colon polyps and cancers to be imaged
from the outside without inserting anything at all.</TE>
<TE>   It is sobering to consider that Ridlehoover and I will both be 70
when the capsule is finally opened. But by then, I'm quite sure, 70
will be young and the start--just the start--of the prime of life.</TE>

<HD>Complications Feared if Rush to Botox Occurs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA MARSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that Botox has received U.S. approval as an anti-wrinkle
treatment, doctors already are warning that an expected promotional
blitz will likely send many image-conscious Americans flocking for
treatment to inexperienced health professionals, resulting in
potentially dangerous complications.</LD>
<LD>   Approval by the Food and Drug Administration will give consumers
more confidence about the safety of the procedure, doctors said, and
the product's manufacturer, Irvine-based Allergan, has announced
plans for a $50-million advertising campaign to raise awareness and
boost sales. Moreover, experts anticipate a flurry of advertising and
fierce price competition among dermatologists and other doctors,
similar to the laser eye-surgery boom that began in the mid-1990s.</LD>
<LD>   "This will convince a lot of people who've never touched [Botox]
before that it's OK to use," said Dr. Richard G. Glogau, a clinical
professor of dermatology at UC San Francisco, who has used botulinum
toxin type A, or Botox, in his practice for eight years. "But we're
going to see all sorts of strange aesthetic outcomes when these
procedures are performed by physicians who haven't done them before."</LD>
<TE>   Of course, plastic surgeons, dermatologists and ophthalmologists
have been using Botox, which was approved by the FDA in 1989 to treat
eye-muscle disorders, as a quick fix for wrinkles for years. Federal
law allows doctors some discretion to use drugs for unapproved--or
"off label"--uses. More than 855,000 Americans got Botox injections
last year, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons,
making it the most popular nonsurgical cosmetic procedure. Costs for
the treatment vary, but the average is put at about $400.</TE>
<TE>   If demand spikes, as anticipated, some experts fear it will spawn
a gold rush mentality among the nation's doctors. "This is pure manna
from heaven, and every Tom, Dick and Harry with a medical degree is
going to be doing this," said Dr. Mark Gorney, medical director of
the Doctors' Company, a large medical liability insurer in Napa.
"There's an enormous potential for abuse."</TE>
<TE>   Already, there have been reports about Botox "parties," where
doctors give groups of patients shots for reduced fees, sometimes
with cookies and champagne. "This smacks of a cavalier attitude,
which flies in the face of common medical sense," says Dr. Edward
Luce, president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons and chief
of plastic surgery at University Hospital in Cleveland. "And what
will happen in the future when anybody with a syringe and Botox
starts injecting this?"</TE>
<TE>   Still, Botox, which is derived from a diluted form of the toxin
that causes botulism, a potentially fatal form of food poisoning, is
considered quite safe for its current cosmetic use. Yet botulinum, in
its full-strength, poisonous form, is considered so dangerous that it
is ranked as a potential biological weapon, on the same list as
anthrax and smallpox. An Allergan spokeswoman said last week that the
company is producing Botox at a factory in Ireland and added that
safety guidelines are being followed.</TE>
<TE>   Botox works by paralyzing facial muscles, such as furrows between
the eyebrows, frown lines and forehead wrinkles, and ironing out
these creases. Those effects last only three to six months.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the procedure isn't risk-free. Side effects include face pain,
nausea, flu-like symptoms and, in rare instances, excruciating
headaches. And overuse of Botox injections can result in the loss of
facial expression, creating a mask-like appearance. Perhaps worse, an
injection into the wrong muscles can cause droopy eyelids, asymmetric
smiles or even drooling.</TE>
<TE>   With 44 muscles in the face, the musculature is quite intricate,
said Glogau.</TE>
<TE>   "Very few people in medicine really know facial anatomy well," he
said. "These injections have to be precisely placed--it's not like
hitting your rear end."</TE>
<TE>   Others believe, however, that physicians will behave responsibly.
"Doctors wouldn't allow nurses to do these injections if they weren't
trained, or confident they were competent," said Janette Wackerly, a
nursing education consultant with the California Board of Registered
Nursing in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Medical experts urge consumers to seek out a doctor with a lot of
experience--and not to be afraid to ask about their background.
"There can be a steep learning curve," said Dr. James H. Wells, a
Long Beach plastic surgeon and president of the California Society of
Plastic Surgeons.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't something that should be done on impulse--take the
time to find a physician who knows what he or she is doing to get the
best results."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stroke experts have an expression that sums up in three words the
essence of their challenge: Time is brain. It means that there's a
very brief window of opportunity for finding out what caused the
stroke and selecting the treatment that's appropriate to the injury.
And while that diagnosis and decision-making is taking place, the
risk of damage to vital brain tissue increases minute by minute.</LD>
<LD>   There have been major advances in recent years that save time, and
now a study has shown that one of these high-speed
techniques--contrast-enhanced helical CT scanning--improves
diagnostic accuracy nearly 100%.</LD>
<LD>   A helical scan, or spiral CT scan, involves a smooth and
constantly moving table and gantry, which is the device encircling
the table that holds the X-ray tube. In contrast, a standard CT scan
has a stop-and-start motion that doesn't permit the 360-degree,
almost continuous, image-taking of the helical scan. When a small
dose of contrast material is injected into the bloodstream and a
helical scan of the head is done, the entire brain and its major
blood vessels can be pictured in less than a minute.</LD>
<TE>   "This technique tells us about the blood vessels ... blood flow to
the brain itself, the severity of the injury and the type of stroke,"
said Michael H. Lev, director of the neurovascular lab at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   In a study of 40 acute-stroke patients, Lev and colleagues at the
Boston hospital found that the contrast-enhanced helical CT scan
almost doubled the accuracy of a diagnosis that was based on
information gleaned from the physical exam and a standard CT
scan--the current routine at most hospitals. The neurologists'
ability to locate where the stroke was and identify the blood vessels
involved increased from 40% accuracy to nearly 80% using the newer
technique. Assessing the area of the brain affected climbed from 55%
to 88%. "Most university medical centers in the U.S. and Canada have
the ability to do this examination, and it's increasingly being used
to evaluate acute-stroke patients," Lev said. (Stroke 2002;
33:959-966.)</TE>

<TE>   Household Pain Killer Linked to Accidental Poisonings</TE>
<TE>   An overdose of acetaminophen is one of the leading causes of
poisoning deaths in the United States. Acetaminophen is the generic
name for the substance in many pain relievers and sinus medications,
such as Tylenol and Excedrin.</TE>
<TE>   While most people who die have taken the overdose on purpose, some
fatalities are accidental poisonings. Despite clearly stated warnings
and dose precautions on the label, people in pain--particularly those
with chronic pain or who have had too much to drink--sometimes fail
to heed the warning. And, according to a new study, they may be in
even greater danger than the suicidal person who has taken larger
amounts of the drug.</TE>
<TE>   People who intentionally overdose tend to get to the hospital
sooner, said Chirag Parikh, clinical instructor in nephrology at the
University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver and author of
a study of 93 victims of acetaminophen poisoning. "They regret their
action, get scared, or someone discovers what they've done, and they
come to the emergency room right away," said Parikh. And treatment
with the antidote, N-acetylcysteine can be a lifesaver when given
within 12 hours of the overdose.</TE>
<TE>   Parikh found that those who overdosed by accident waited longer to
come to the emergency room, and even though their blood levels of the
drug were lower than those who took too much intentionally, the
medical care they required was greater and more costly. In fact, the
two deaths in the cases Parikh reviewed were due to accidental
poisoning. "People were often taking acetaminophen day in and day out
for months, usually for a chronic condition like back pain," he says.
And alcohol use made the situation even more threatening, since the
combination is toxic to the liver. (Critical Care 2002, 6:155-159.)</TE>

<TE>   Sleep Training Helps Seniors Who Have Chronic Illnesses</TE>
<TE>   Sleep is as important to an older person's health as nutrition and
exercise. Yet older people with chronic illnesses who may need a good
night's sleep the most seem to have a harder time getting it. But
according to an AARP-funded study, insomnia is not an unavoidable
consequence of illness. Elderly people with cardiovascular disease,
arthritis and other conditions can benefit from the same sleep
training that's helped healthy people and shift workers.</TE>
<TE>   In a study of 38 seniors with insomnia and two or more chronic
illnesses, Bruce Rybarczyk, associate professor of psychology at
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago, found that
those who took part in an eight-week, in-classroom, sleep-training
program increased their sleep efficiency by 18% on average. "That
sounds minor, but for most of them that adds up to 11 hours each week
not wasted in bed tossing and turning," said Rybarczyk. Some of these
people have been spending 10 hours in bed but are awake for three.
Their sleep was fragmented. Another group of seniors in the study
tested a six-week, at-home program, initially developed by Inner
Health Inc. in San Diego for pilots and shift workers. For
comparison, a third group received no training. The at-home group
improved substantially but not quite as much as the classroom-trained
group. Nevertheless, the ease of doing the program yourself is a
great advantage, said Rybarczyk.</TE>
<TE>   A $1-million grant from the National Institutes of Health is
underway to determine if the program not only lengthens sleep but
also helps people with chronic disease sleep more deeply.</TE>
<TE>   Key elements of the sleep training are initially limiting the time
in bed to the usual number of hours of sleep, getting up at the same
time regardless of the total hours of sleep and no napping.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First Trimester Test for Toxemia Developed</TE>
<TE>   Each year, more than 200,000 pregnant women develop a condition
for which there is no known cause, no treatment, and the only cure is
delivery of the baby, ready or not. It's called pre- eclampsia or
toxemia, and if it worsens to eclampsia, it can be fatal. Now,
researchers have discovered that a biomarker for the condition can be
detected during the first trimester of pregnancy, well before the
high blood pressure that characterizes preeclampsia develops.</TE>
<TE>   The first blood test for the marker, a protein called SHBG, or sex
hormone binding globulin, has been studied in 135 women, and
researchers found that those who have low levels of SHBG are at
increased risk. Those women studied are part of a group of more than
4,500 participating in the Massachusetts General Hospital Obstetrical
Maternal Study. When they were first seen early in their pregnancies
at the hospital, a blood sample was taken and stored for subsequent
research. These blood samples allowed investigators to test for SHBG
and compare the results in women who eventually developed eclampsia
to the levels in women who had normal blood pressure throughout their
pregnancies.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers learned that the greater the rise in SHBG, the
less the risk of preeclampsia. (Normally SHBG levels increase during
the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.) (The Journal of
Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism 87 [4]: 1563-1568.)</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Perhaps you've seen the infomercial for a gadget that supposedly
makes perfect pancakes. At three in the morning, the power of
suggestion can be almost overwhelming. But pancakes seem so
fattening, so indulgent....</LD>
<LD>   Even if you can resist the urge to call and order a pancake maker,
there's no need to forgo pancakes entirely. With some imagination,
pancakes are not so bad. It's what we cook them in, and what we put
around and on top of them, that's usually the calorie culprit.</LD>
<LD>   Prepared mixes are usually fairly low in fat, although they may
contain partially hydrogenated oils and whole milk solids. But most
mixes are also relatively low in fiber and high in sodium.</LD>
<TE>   If you don't want to venture out on your own, look for mixes made
from whole grains and that have reduced sodium levels. But you can
also start from scratch.</TE>
<TE>   Another way to add fiber or a little crunch to your pancakes is to
mix in such extras as instant oatmeal, wheat germ, oat bran, grated
apples, dried fruits, fresh (or defrosted frozen) blueberries or
other seasonal fruits. Adding canned pumpkin or pureed bananas also
adds flavor and such nutrients as beta carotene and potassium.</TE>
<TE>   Cooking pancakes on a nonstick pan or griddle coated with a small
amount of oil also keeps the fat content down. Use a paper towel to
rub the surface of the pan with about 1/2 tablespoon of oil, or use a
nonstick cooking spray. Using too much oil causes pancakes to brown
unevenly and will make the edges crisp.</TE>
<TE>   One tablespoon of butter as a pancake topping adds 100 calories
and almost 12 grams of fat, mostly saturated. Two tablespoons of
regular syrup add about 120 calories. The so-called "lite" syrups
have fewer calories because they have usually been diluted with
water.</TE>
<TE>   The best way to squeeze out the fat and calories is to make a
simple sauce from fresh fruit. Berries work especially well, but you
can do this with almost any fruit. The bonus is that a cup of fresh
blueberries, for example, contains about a third of the recommended
daily allowance of vitamin C. Cook the fruit in some water or apple
juice until it is soft; if necessary, sweeten it with a little bit of
"lite" syrup or brown sugar. If you want to thicken the sauce, add a
little cornstarch mixed with water and bring the mixture to a boil.</TE>
<TE>   Another great idea is to heat up some applesauce, mixed with a
little cinnamon, and spoon it over your pancakes.</TE>
<TE>   Leftover pancake batter (preferably unsweetened and not highly
flavored) can be used to thicken soups or sauces by whisking it into
a hot mixture and stirring thoroughly. Cold pancakes are also quite
delicious when rolled up and stuffed with fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Remember that breakfast fuels you up for the morning and gives you
the energy to make it until lunch or dinner. One of the reasons it is
such an important meal (and not only for children) is that it can
really concentrate some of the nutrients you need every day. There
probably isn't a better time to incorporate fruit and whole grains,
low-fat sources of calcium and fiber, even if you're on the run.</TE>

<HD>A Novice Surgeon Journeys Into the Unknown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ATUL GAWANDE</AU>
<BD>Atul Gawande is a surgical resident at a hospital in
Boston and a staff writer on science and medicine for the New Yorker
magazine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not everyone appreciates the attractions of surgery. When you are a
medical student in the operating room for the first time, and you see
the surgeon press the scalpel to someone's body and open it like
fruit, you either shudder in horror or gape in awe. I gaped. It was
not just the blood and guts that enthralled me. It was the idea that
a mere person would have the confidence to wield that scalpel in the
first place.</LD>
<LD>   There is a saying about surgeons, meant as a reproof: "Sometimes
wrong; never in doubt." But this seemed to me their strength. Every
day, surgeons are faced with uncertainties. Information is
inadequate; the science is ambiguous; one's knowledge and abilities
are never perfect. Even with the simplest operation, it cannot be
taken for granted that a patient will come through better off--or
even alive. Standing at the table my first time, I wondered how the
surgeon knew that he would do this patient good, that all the steps
would go as planned, that bleeding would be controlled and infection
would not take hold and organs would not be injured. He didn't, of
course. But still he cut.</LD>
<TE>   Later, while still a student, I was allowed to make an incision
myself. The surgeon drew a six-inch dotted line with a marking pen
across a sleeping patient's abdomen and then, to my surprise, had the
nurse hand me the knife. It was, I remember, still warm from the
sterilizing autoclave. The surgeon had me stretch the skin taut with
the thumb and forefinger of my free hand. He told me to make one
smooth slice down to the fat. I put the belly of the blade to the
skin and cut. The experience was odd and addictive, mixing
exhilaration from the calculated violence of the act, anxiety about
getting it right, and a righteous faith that it was somehow good for
the person. There was also the slightly nauseating feeling of finding
that it took more force that I'd realized. (Skin is thick and
springy, and on my first pass I did not go nearly deep enough; I had
to cut twice to get through.) The moment made me want to be a
surgeon--not to be an amateur handed the knife for a brief moment,
but someone with the confidence to proceed as if it were routine.</TE>
<TE>   A resident, however, begins with none of this air of mastery--only
a still overpowering instinct against doing anything like pressing a
knife against flesh or jabbing a needle into someone's chest. On my
first day as a surgical resident, I was assigned to the emergency
room. Among my first patients was a skinny, dark-haired woman in her
late twenties who hobbled in, teeth gritted, with a
two-and-a-half-foot-long wooden chair leg somehow nailed into the
bottom of her foot. She explained that the leg had collapsed out from
under a kitchen chair she had tried to sit upon and, leaping up to
keep from falling, she inadvertently stomped her bare foot onto the
three-inch screw sticking out of it. I tried very hard to look like
someone who had not just got his medical diploma the week before.
Instead, I would be nonchalant, world-weary, the kind of guy who had
seen this sort of thing a hundred times before. I inspected her foot,
and could see that the screw was embedded in the bone at the base of
her big toe. There was no bleeding, and, so far as I could feel, no
fracture.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow, that must hurt," I blurted out, idiotically.</TE>
<TE>   The obvious thing to do was give her a tetanus shot and pull out
the screw. I ordered the tetanus shot, but I began to have doubts
about pulling out the screw. Suppose she bled? Or suppose I fractured
her foot? Or something worse? I excused myself and tracked down Dr.
W., the senior surgeon on duty. I found him tending to a car-crash
victim. The patient was a mess. People were shouting. Blood was all
over the floor. It was not a good time to ask questions.</TE>
<TE>   I ordered an X-ray. I figured it would buy time and let me check
my amateur impression that she didn't have a fracture. Sure enough,
getting one took about an hour, and it showed no fracture--just a
common screw embedded, the radiologist said, "in the head of the
first metatarsal." I showed the patient the X-ray. "You see, the
screw's embedded in the head of the first metatarsal," I said. And
the plan, she wanted to know? Ah, yes, the plan.</TE>
<TE>   I went to find Dr. W. He was still tied up with the crash victim,
but I was able to interrupt to show him the X-ray. He chuckled at the
sight of it and asked me what I wanted to do. "Pull the screw out?" I
ventured. "Yes," he said, by which he meant "Duh." He made sure I'd
given a tetanus shot and then shooed me away.</TE>
<TE>   Back in the room, I told her that I would pull the screw out,
prepared for her to say something like "You?" Instead she said,
"O.K., doctor," and it was time for me to get down to business. At
first I had her sitting on the exam table, dangling her leg off the
side. But that didn't look as if it would work. Eventually, I had her
lie with her foot jutting off end of the table, the board poking out
into the air. With every move, her pain increased. I injected a local
anesthetic where the screw went in and that helped a little. Now I
grabbed her foot in one hand, the board in the other, and then for a
moment I froze. Could I really do this? Should I really do this? Who
was I to presume?</TE>
<TE>   Finally, I just made myself do it. I gave her a one-two-three and
pulled, too gingerly at first and then, forcing myself, hard. She
groaned. The screw wasn't budging. I twisted, and abruptly it came
free. There was no bleeding. I washed out the wound, as my textbooks
said to for puncture wounds. She found she could walk, though the
foot was sore. I warned her of the risks of infection and the signs
to look for. Her gratitude was immense and flattering, like the
lion's for the mouse--and that night I went home elated.</TE>
<TE>   In surgery, as in anything else, skill and confidence are learned
through experience--haltingly and humiliatingly. Like the tennis
player and the oboist and the guy who fixes hard drives, we need
practice to get good at what we do. There is one difference in
surgery, though: It is people we practice upon.</TE>

<HD>Gene Therapy May Have Cured Four Boys</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID BROWN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>French researchers say that four boys stricken with a usually fatal
type of immune deficiency are living normal lives following gene
therapy procedures done, in one case, as long ago as 2 1/2 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   A paper in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine expands on a
report two years ago showing benefit in the months immediately
following the replacement of a defective gene with a functional one.
The new study, which includes the experience of two more patients and
a much longer period of observation, raises the possibility the boys
may be the first human beings cured by gene therapy.</LD>
<LD>   Ernest Beutler, a gene-therapy expert at Scripps Research
Institute in La Jolla, said of the procedure's effect: "I would guess
that very likely it's going to be permanent. That's a rather
comforting length of time."</LD>
<TE>   All four boys have a rare condition called X-linked severe
combined immunodeficiency, or SCID, which has numerous causes. In the
X-linked form, immune system cells lack a receptor for substances,
called interleukins, on their surfaces. It is the ailment that
afflicted David, the "bubble boy" in Texas who spent most of his life
in a sterile tent before dying in 1984 at age 12.</TE>
<TE>   All four children now live at home. Before they were treated, all
had suffered severe infections or skin conditions caused by immune
deficiency. These subsided and haven't recurred, the researchers
reported.</TE>

<HD>Use of Hormone Therapy Questioned</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RIDGELY OCHS</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An international panel has concluded that, based on current evidence,
there are questions about using hormone replacement therapy for more
than relieving menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes.</LD>
<LD>   Experts gathered by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute
and Office of Research on Women's Health, both part of the National
Institutes of Health, and the Giovanni Lorenzini Medical Science
Foundation, a private Italian group, sponsored four conferences over
a seven-year period examining the current data on the use of hormone
replacement therapy.</LD>
<LD>   Their paper, one chapter of which was presented last month and the
rest of which is to be published in June, is "really a synthesis of
existing information," said Dr. Jacques Rossouw, acting director of
the Women's Health Initiative, a federally funded study. "From my
point of view, I don't think there's any new information," said
Rossouw, a member of the international panel.</LD>
<TE>   But, he and others said, the purpose of the paper is to help
doctors and patients make the best possible decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether or not to go on hormone-replacement therapy remains one
of the biggest questions for physicians and women," said Dr. Vivian
Pinn, director of the Office of Research on Women's Health.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as five years ago, hormone replacement therapy, or
HRT, was recommended to menopausal women for the prevention of
cardiovascular disease. But several studies since then have found
that it was not protective in older women who already have heart
disease. Similarly, studies have found that it does not stop the
progress of early Alzheimer's disease. And recent studies have also
questioned its usefulness in preventing osteoporosis. Studies have
not shown that HRT relieves major depression, although it does appear
to help mood and sleep disturbances in women going through menopause.
Trials have also found it does not appear to improve urinary
incontinence.</TE>
<TE>   Yet hormone replacement therapy remains popular: About 17 million
American women take HRT, and Wyeth's Premarin, the most popular HRT
drug, is the "No. 1 prescribed product," according to Natalie deVane,
a spokeswoman for Wyeth Pharmaceuticals in St. David's, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   The impact of the current paper appeared mixed. Amy Allina of the
nonprofit National Women's Health Network praised it, saying "it's
not new research, but it's new for NIH to back such a very limited
use of HRT, to say it's really only effective in the treatment of
menopausal symptoms."</TE>
<TE>   But Dr. Wulf Utian, executive director of the nonprofit North
American Menopause Society, said the data are still too preliminary
to say HRT has such limited benefit, especially in the prevention of
heart disease in healthy women.</TE>

<HD>Age Not Always a Factor in Driver's Speed or Ability</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aha! Just as I thought! California's speed limits are minimum speeds,
not maximum speeds. In "When a Privilege Yields to Age" (April 1), we
are told to watch our elders for signs of declining driving skills.
One of the signs is "driving slower than the posted limits." Where I
come from we bust people for speeding, not for loafing. But, by
golly, I will take this bit of profound wisdom home with me and share
it with my geriatric cohorts.</LD>
<LD>   JIM TANDY</LD>
<LD>   Alpine, AZ</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "When Driving Yields to Age" is correct when it asserts that
people should not be allowed to drive if they do it dangerously. I
also agree, in "Signs of Declining Driving Skills," that people who
do those things should lose their driving privilege. But what does
that have to do with age? I see people of all ages displaying most of
those deficiencies on the road every day.</TE>
<TE>   Whether a person is allowed to drive should depend on their
driving skills, not some arbitrary age.</TE>
<TE>   SANFORD THEIR</TE>
<TE>   Marina Del Rey</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Why not bypass the politics and the sentimentality, and just make
it a law that before someone can get a handicapped tag, they must
have a new driving test? Too many of the elderly and otherwise
impaired drivers act as if the tag itself is a magic shield against
injury and a protection from their own bad driving.</TE>
<TE>   STUART FINK</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I have been teaching AARP's Driver Safety program (more familiarly
known as 55 Alive) for nearly eight years, and as a result I am quite
familiar with most of the situations the story describes and
incorporate most of them into my lectures. One point I usually
introduce, early in my presentation, is that each and every person in
attendance, including me, has had less than one year's driving
experience at the age he or she is now. Therefore, we all have to
relearn and reassess our driving skills, frequently.</TE>
<TE>   In driving, as well as everything else, the things we could do in
our 20s or 30s have no relationship on what we can do in our 70s.
Hopefully we are smarter. We must use those smarts before we forge
ahead.</TE>

<LD>Understanding Women</LD>
<LD>   With AD/HD</LD>
<LD>   Edited by Kathleen G. Nadeau</LD>
<TE>   and Dr. Patricia O. Quinn</TE>
<TE>   Advantage Books</TE>
<TE>   $19.95, 465 pages</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Overview: The editors, a psychologist and a physician who
specialize in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, have put
together this companion to their earlier volume, "Understanding Girls
with AD/HD." Because the disorder occurs more often in men, women
with the disorder often are overlooked. This book aims to help women
get a proper diagnosis and take charge of their health and work
lives.</TE>
<TE>   What Works: The book is divided into eight sections that examine
medical aspects of the disorder, nonmedical treatments, where to get
support and the various impacts that the disorder can have. It's
especially good at helping women identify and manage the challenges
they may face at work, at school, in relationships and in daily life.
Readers may want to use this as a reference book, reading selected
chapters. It's especially useful for those who suspect they have ADHD
or are trying to understand someone who does.</TE>

<HD>It's the Next Best Thing to Mother's Milk</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Few pediatricians and parents would dispute that breast milk is the
best source of nutrients for infants during the first year of life.
But for a variety of reasons, many women choose not to breastfeed,
and for some women breastfeeding is not an option. Fortunately, there
is a safe alternative: infant formula.</LD>
<LD>   Formula is designed to mimic, as much as possible, the composition
of breast milk, and to provide an adequate balance of energy and
nutrients. A number of formulas are available--to choose the right
one, it's important to understand the differences.</LD>
<LD>   Although the majority of formula sold in the United States is
derived from cow's milk, the sale of soy formula (which is made from
soybeans) has nearly doubled in the last decade or so. (Currently,
about 25% of formula-fed infants are given soy-based formula.)</LD>
<TE>   The most significant difference between cow's milk and soy
formulas is the types of proteins and carbohydrates they contain. The
proteins of each are modified considerably to make them more
digestible for babies. The principal carbohydrate in cow's milk
formula is lactose. Soy formula, on the other hand, contains
carbohydrates such as sucrose and is lactose-free.</TE>
<TE>   For most infants, either type of formula is fine. Although high
levels of aluminum and hormonally active compounds (called soy
isoflavones, or phytoestrogens) in soy formula have worried some
doctors, recent research has found the formula to be safe. Experts
now believe that for healthy, full-term infants, soy-based formula is
a safe alternative to cow's milk formula. They do not think that it
offers significant advantages for most infants; for example, it
appears to have no benefit over cow's milk formula in the prevention
of allergic disease.</TE>
<TE>   But soy formula is better for infants who can't tolerate the
lactose in cow's milk or who are allergic to cow's milk protein.
These conditions are relatively rare, however--a true milk protein
allergy occurs in only about 2% to 3% of infants. Soy formula is also
indicated for children whose parents want them to consume a
vegetarian diet.</TE>
<TE>   A third type of formula, hypoallergenic formula, contains proteins
that are more extensively broken down than in cow's milk or soy
formula and are less likely to cause allergic reactions. It is
principally used for breastfeeding infants who develop symptoms of
food allergy and for formula-fed infants allergic to both cow's milk
and soy formulas. Hypoallergenic formula is significantly more
expensive than other types and should only be used on the advice of a
physician.</TE>
<TE>   For those who choose to use a cow's milk formula, an additional
decision is necessary: to fortify with iron or not. (All soy-based
formula is iron-fortified.) Infant formulas are classified as
low-iron or iron-fortified based on whether they contain less or more
than 6.7 milligrams per liter of iron.</TE>
<TE>   The goal of iron fortification is not only to meet children's need
for this important nutrient, but to protect them against the later
development of anemia. Iron-fortified formula is recommended by the
American Academy of Pediatrics for all bottle-fed infants from birth
to 1 year of age and for all breastfed infants whose mothers do not
exclusively breastfeed.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these recommendations, low-iron formula accounts for up to
30% of all the formula sold in the United States. Some parents opt
for it because they mistakenly believe that formula with added iron
causes gastrointestinal problems like constipation, diarrhea or
colic. Other parents are unsure what to make of the "with iron" label
that fortified formula is required to carry. (Some experts suggest
removing this label from fortified formula and instead labeling
low-iron formula as "nutritionally incomplete.")</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the type of formula used, prepare it exactly as
directed on the packaging. With powdered or concentrated formula, do
not add more water than necessary. Diluted formula won't provide
enough calories and nutrients, and can potentially cause seizures.
(And, despite what some parents believe, it's not the answer to
spitting up or gastrointestinal problems like diarrhea or
constipation.)</TE>
<TE>   Although most experts advocate using sterilized water to prepare
infant formula, there is some controversy about whether it's
necessary when water from a public water system is available.</TE>
<TE>   Water from a public source is treated to reduce the amount of
harmful bacteria and is unlikely to cause illness, even in infants.
But, because bacteria or other infectious organisms--like
parasites--can occasionally reach dangerous levels, sterilizing the
water used in formula is probably a good precaution. (To sterilize
water, bring it to a full boil for one to two minutes, allowing it to
cool completely before serving it.)</TE>
<TE>   Store any formula prepared in advance in the refrigerator. Once
formula is prepared (or, in the case of ready-to-use formula, the
vacuum seal is broken), bacteria can start to grow and multiply in
it. Storing it at a cold temperature slows--but does not stop--the
rate of bacterial growth. If prepared formula isn't used within 24
hours, throw it away.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, don't substitute cow's milk for formula before age 1.
Formula is specially designed to meet the nutritional needs of
infants during this critical period of growth and development; cow's
milk is not. Although it's not breast milk, formula is the next best
thing for a baby's first year.</TE>

<HD>Use of Eye Cells in Treating Parkinson's Shows Promise</HD>
<DH>Research: Six patients gained motor skills in test of
implants that sidestep touchy fetal-cell issues. A larger clinical
trial is planned later this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new type of cell transplant to treat Parkinson's disease appears to
significantly improve patients' movements while avoiding the ethical
quandaries linked to fetal and stem cell use.</LD>
<LD>   The technique, which so far has been tested only in six patients,
uses eye cells obtained from a cadaver donor. These retinal pigment
epithelial cells, isolated from the retina, produce dopamine--a
neurotransmitter that is present in abnormally low quantities in the
brains of Parkinson's victims--although researchers do not yet know
why the cells do so.</LD>
<LD>   But what makes the cell treatment particularly attractive is that
these cells can easily be grown in the laboratory. A small number of
cells from a single eye can be cultured to produce hundreds of
millions of cells, enough to treat thousands of patients, said Dr.
Louis R. Bucalo, president of Titan Pharmaceuticals Inc. of South San
Francisco, which makes the transplant material.</LD>
<TE>   Titan attaches the cells to microscopic gelatin beads, which help
them grow. The company calls the finished product Spheramine.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ray Watts of the Emory University School of Medicine in
Atlanta and his colleagues implanted Spheramine cells in six patients
with a moderate form of Parkinson's. They drilled five holes through
each patient's skull on one side of the head, then used a long, thin
needle to inject a total of 325,000 cells into each patient's
striatum, the area of the brain that controls movement.</TE>
<TE>   Watts reported last week at a Denver meeting of the American
Academy of Neurology that, one year after the implants, the patients
averaged a 50% improvement in motor function on a Parkinson's
assessment scale. One patient has now had the implant for two years
with no loss of benefit.</TE>
<TE>   "This is as good as, or better than, any other current therapy,"
Watts said.</TE>
<TE>   Parkinson's, which strikes as many as 100,000 Americans each year,
is characterized by severe tremors and rigidity in the limbs and loss
of muscle control. Although its primary cause is unknown, the
disorder results from the death of brain cells that produce dopamine,
which plays a key role in transmitting commands from the brain's
muscle-control centers.</TE>
<TE>   The first line of treatment is the use of drugs, such as l-dopa,
that stimulate production of dopamine, but such drugs lose their
effect over time as the number of dopamine-producing cells continues
to decline.</TE>
<TE>   Surgeons have tried implanting a variety of dopamine-producing
cells into the brain with mixed results. The first attempts were with
cells from the patient's own adrenal glands, which produced initial
improvements in motion. "But adult cells do not survive very long in
the brain," Bucalo said.</TE>
<TE>   The greatest amount of work has been done with fetal brain cells,
which survive much longer than adult cells. At the Denver meeting,
Dr. Curt Freed of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center
updated his studies on 32 patients who received fetal cell grafts for
advanced Parkinson's. He said the procedure works best in patients
who are younger than 60 and who respond well to drug therapy.</TE>
<TE>   But he also noted that 15% of the patients exhibited uncontrolled
jerking movements and other side effects resulting from too much
production of dopamine by the implanted cells. In these cases, the
team had to administer drugs to reduce dopamine production or use a
type of brain pacemaker to reduce the unwanted movements.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest problem with fetal cell transplants is that it is
difficult to obtain human fetal cells because of religious and
ethical objections to their use in experiments, as well as federal
restrictions on funding such research. The Titan approach, Bucalo
said, eliminates this problem.</TE>
<TE>   Titan hopes to begin a larger clinical trial later this year in
which Watts and other neurosurgeons will enroll as many as 80
patients. Those patients will receive injections of the cells on both
sides of their brains, which Watts hopes will increase the efficacy
of the implants. Half of the patients will receive the implants and
half will undergo a sham operation.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the larger study replicates the findings, it would still
be several years before the technique could be in widespread use.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to take [the current results] with a grain of salt
because we can not rule out some placebo effect," Watts said. "We
must move to a controlled study to prove that it works beyond a
shadow of a doubt."</TE>

<HD>Resistant Strep Sounds a Warning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An outbreak of strep throat resistant to a common antibiotic could be
considered a wake-up call that some drugs may fail when they're
needed.</LD>
<LD>   In monitoring 100 children at a Pittsburgh school last year, Dr.
Judith M. Martin found 46 children with strains resistant to
erythromycin, one of the most frequently used drugs for strep.
Although some children never became ill, others had to be treated
with different antibiotics.</LD>
<LD>   Martin, who reported her findings in last week's New England
Journal of Medicine, said weekly throat swabs showed continued
resistance this year among children in the same school.</LD>
<TE>   There have been many reports of other bacteria that didn't respond
to certain antibiotics, but "this is really the first time this is
recorded to this degree in the United States with group A
streptococcus," said Martin, a pediatric infectious-disease
specialist at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. "People have looked
for it but never found it."</TE>
<TE>   Strep A bacteria are responsible for sore throats, high
temperatures, rheumatic fever and sometimes life-threatening
infections that are difficult to control.</TE>
<TE>   Martin's discovery has major implications for the way doctors
think about and prescribe antibiotics in this country.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, physicians have been criticized for too often
acceding to patient requests for antibiotics at the first sign of
sore throats or ear infections. To make matters worse, they sometimes
prescribe a drug related to erythromycin, called azithromycin
(Zithromax), which requires just six pills in five days, instead of
the front-line amoxicillin or penicillin. Those drugs require three
pills a day for 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Martin has found a pocket of some resistance to
erythromycin, that means the entire group of antibiotics called
macrolides--erythromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin
(Biaxin)--might fail to win the battle against infection with strep
A.</TE>
<TE>   Not only should doctors be more prudent when deciding whether to
prescribe antibiotics, Martin said, they should use amoxicillin or
penicillin except with patients allergic to either of them. Strep A
has not been shown to resist either of those workhorse drugs.</TE>
<TE>   She also recommends that public health officials support broader
surveillance with strep-throat cultures to identify other groups of
resistance cases around the country.</TE>
<TE>   Already, Dr. Stanford Shulman, chief of infectious disease at
Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, is studying 1,000 children
with strep throat at 13 locations, including Southern California.
Although the information is still incomplete, "there appears to be at
least some increase in this resistance compared to previous years,"
Shulman said.</TE>
<TE>   "If indeed the Pittsburgh experience is reflective of other
places, we won't be able to assume that the macrolides will be
effective," he added.</TE>
<TE>   In the Pittsburgh case, Martin said, the researchers notified
local pediatricians, who responded by changing their prescribing
habits and using less of the macrolides.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors know from experiences in Finland and Japan, which had high
rates of macrolide use, that resistance went down when they
prescribed less of those drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "Both are good examples of how you can make a difference," Martin
said.</TE>

<HD>Why Stress Tips the Scales</HD>
<DH>Frayed nerves increase our desire for carbohydrates and
fat. And, if the pressure is chronic, we try even harder to hold on
to those pounds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA KING</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gale Cordell has never been seriously overweight. In fact, if you ate
lunch with her, you would think she was a model eater. But the
57-year-old's ovo-lacto-vegetarian diet degenerates into chaotic,
solitary chocolate candy binges when she's upset.</LD>
<LD>   With lots of exercise, Cordell managed to stay a size 6 for most
of her adult life. But two years ago a stress fracture curtailed her
exercise, and her eating got so out of control that she gained 35
pounds. The depressing weight gain exacerbated the problem. "The more
uncomfortable your clothes become, the more stress eating you do,"
she says.</LD>
<LD>   Cordell is far from alone. Sixty percent of Americans are
overweight or obese, and many of them say that their eating habits
worsen when they are stressed. Says Gail Frank, a Los Angeles
dietitian and spokesperson for the American Dietetic Assn.:
"Everybody deals with stress, and food happens to be one of the
things they're manipulating. This is the reality in today's world."</LD>
<TE>   Out-of-control eating and weight gain may seem like an irrational,
self-destructive response to stress. But food binges and weight gain
make biological sense. Under stress, the brain shifts into
self-preservation mode, unleashing an array of chemicals and hormones
that protect the body from physical danger.</TE>
<TE>   An essential survival mechanism when our ancestors expended lots
of energy dodging mountain lions and wrestling with heavy farm
equipment, this figh-or-flight response backfires in these sedentary
times, when most of our stressors are of the nonphysical sort like
IRS deadlines and crashing computers.</TE>
<TE>   Those who have not inherited resilient bodies and minds that can
shrug off traffic jams and long lines at the supermarket are more
likely to continually enter this self-protective mode. Ultimately,
not only do the stress hormones make them hungry, they also make them
more likely to pack on the pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Says Dr. Pamela Peeke, a professor of medicine at the University
of Maryland who studied the link between weight and stress at the
National Institutes of Health: "There is no question that chronic
stress can make you fat."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, chronic stress can trigger a number of other medical
conditions, including memory loss, hypertension and heart disease.
But bariatric physician Dr. Paul Rivas, author of "Turn Off the
Hunger Switch," says that unlike those conditions, "emotional"
overeating is seen as a character flaw when it leads to excess
weight.</TE>
<TE>   Rivas tells his guilt-ridden patients that their compulsion to
overeat is a biological flaw, not a character flaw: "It is not
because you lack willpower or self-control. You don't even know what
you're doing. You're grabbing the food. It's compulsive. You're into
a survival mechanism."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Hormonal Cascade Causes Ravenous Hunger</TE>
<TE>   When this stress response is activated, the brain releases a
chemical called corticotropin-releasing hormone, or CRH, that
suppresses appetite. The adrenal glands then secrete their powerful
fight-or-flight stress hormones, adrenaline and cortisol, which
propel sugar into the bloodstream for a short-term energy rush.</TE>
<TE>   After that rush, cortisol sparks ravenous hunger for carbohydrates
and fat. "When you're all stressed out, the last thing you reach for
is a can of tuna," says Peeke. (She notes that "stressed" is
"desserts" spelled backward.)</TE>
<TE>   Worse, we do not give our bodies the downtime they expect after
surviving a close call. Instead, we tax our fight-or-flight response
by activating it throughout the day as we move from long commutes to
demanding bosses to looming day-care pickup deadlines.</TE>
<TE>   The result is prolonged, elevated cortisol levels that spur the
release of insulin, the hormone that directs the body to hang on to
the fat it has and store more. "If you have lots of stressors, you
have lots of periods of rebound insulin secretion. The cumulative
effect is a push toward obesity," says Robert Sapolsky, professor of
biological and neurological sciences at Stanford University School of
Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Stacking the biochemical deck further, the brain's complex
appetite and satiety control system can go haywire under stress.
Rivas says that even if his patients were lounging on a Tahiti beach,
they would have to fight against their drive to overeat. Most people
who overeat when stressed, he says, are genetically prone to an
imbalance among at least three of the brain's neurotransmitters,
serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine, which help the body regulate
both appetite and mood.</TE>
<TE>   Add ornery children and late mortgages to the equation and, says
Rivas, "everything gets worse." For example, when an already short
supply of serotonin dwindles further under stress, overeaters launch
into desperate forays for sweets because carbohydrates, unlike tuna
fish, raise serotonin levels.</TE>
<TE>   There are no reliable estimates of the number of stressed
Americans who desperately scarf down too much food. Weight
statistics, for example, don't give a complete picture because they
miss some thin stress overeaters who compensate for their binges by
starving themselves or exercising maniacally.</TE>
<TE>   However, it is clear that many Americans who are overweight are
stress overeaters. Cynthia Graff, chief executive of the 31-year-old
Lindora Weight Loss Clinics, says her clients are increasingly asking
for help not just with their eating, but with their frazzled lives:
"They're not saying, 'I need to lose weight.' They're saying, 'My
life is out of control.'"</TE>
<TE>   Though they may seem like oddities in this increasingly overweight
country, there are those who turn away from food when they feel their
lives are out of control. Peeke says biology is destiny for these
"stress undereaters" as well: "Their biological instinct is to reject
food." Stress undereaters exhibit "very high" levels of the
appetite-depressing CRH, which trumps cortisol's appetite-enhancing
properties. Peeke notes that anorexics have some of the highest
levels of CRH ever measured in humans.</TE>
<TE>   Even stress overeaters may shift to undereating in the wake of
catastrophic stress, like the death of a parent or a divorce. When
42-year-old Bay Area marketing consultant Elisa Williams got divorced
five years ago, she lost 20 pounds in a few weeks, down from a size
10 to a size 6. She splurged on a mini-sized wardrobe.</TE>
<TE>   After four months she gained the weight back; her mini clothes are
still hanging in her closet. "Divorce weight doesn't last long," says
Williams. Now she warns other women going through divorce to refrain
from spending big bucks on a divorce wardrobe.</TE>
<TE>   That's great advice, because tight-fitting clothes can be a
powerful stressor, especially for women. Women are more likely to
stuff themselves when they're anxious and more likely to feel guilty
about it, according to Alice Domar, a professor at Harvard Medical
School and director of the Mind/Body Center for Women's Health at
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston: "When a man gains 10
pounds he buys a new pair of pants. When a woman gains 10 pounds she
hates herself."</TE>

<TE>   Very Restrictive Diets Are Often Counterproductive</TE>
<TE>   To shed those stress-related pounds and stop stress overeating,
experts offer a range of solutions, including restrictive diets. But
Domar warns against strict diets because they often backfire. When
rigid dieters fall off the wagon by eating a food on their forbidden
list, "They experience the 'What the hell' effect, then go and eat
for the rest of the day like crazy," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Domar teaches an "80/20" plan that focuses on eating healthy foods
80% of the time; 20% of the time her clients eat whatever they want.
"You remove the guilt so they get less stressed," says Domar.</TE>
<TE>   Rivas, many of whose patients have lost weight with "boot camp"
food regimens only to find that they regain that weight and more,
doesn't believe in restrictive diets either. He prescribes drugs that
balance some of the brain's neurotransmitters and believes that
genetically unlucky stress overeaters will likely need to take the
drugs in low dosages for the rest of their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Rivas concedes that the drugs do not work for all stress
overeaters, but says that's because scientists have yet to completely
unravel the complicated mechanisms that link food and stress: "They
have brain chemistries that we don't yet understand."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Blanton, 49, says the drugs have been a godsend for him:
"For the first time in the last 15 years I know what it is to be
hungry. I had forgotten what it was like."</TE>
<TE>   Blanton, who works in intelligence at the Department of Defense,
says that since Sept. 11 the pace at work has been frenetic.
Work-related and other stresses used to intensify his cravings for
the peanuts, doughnuts and chocolate chip cookies that pushed his
weight to an all-time high of 305. No more. Blanton is now eating
like his naturally thin wife, who never turns to food when she is
under pressure, even though stress is "just as hard on her" as it is
on him.</TE>
<TE>   But some clinicians worry about the long-term safety of such
drugs, especially since 1997 when the popular weight-loss drug
fenfluramine was taken off the market because it was linked to heart
valve damage. In addition, those who counsel stress overeaters argue
that in most cases the drugs are not necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe individuals can learn methods to identify how they
respond to stress and how not to let food be the only solution," says
dietitian Frank. Popular behavioral therapies include journals in
which overeaters connect their emotions to their eating, the
substitution of a nurturing, nonfood treat--like a bubble bath--for
self-destructive overeating, and stress management techniques like
biofeedback.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Paul Rosch, president of the American Institute of Stress,
warns that there is no magic destressing technique that works for
everyone: "You have to find something you enjoy and will adhere to
rather than complying with some regimen you will most likely quit
after a short time."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, therapists urge their patients to find an exercise
regimen they like. The morphine-like endorphins released during
exercise help dissipate stress hormones, providing the release that
humans used to get when they led more physical lives.</TE>
<TE>   Now that her stress fracture is healed, Cordell is back to the
exercise she loves, long-distance running. When she was a "severe
sugar addict" she used running not just for the joy of it, but also
to "combat the calories of cake and candy." With Peeke's help, she
has lost 14 pounds and considers herself a reformed sugar addict.</TE>
<TE>   Cordell says she changed her eating habits by changing her
thinking habits. She has let go of the notions that she has to eat
perfectly every day and that she can control everything in her life.</TE>
<TE>   It's an attitude that comes naturally three miles into her runs,
when she experiences an endorphin-induced "runner's high." Cordell's
lengthy to-do list disappears, she becomes philosophical about the
stress in her life and she look for peace within herself, not in a
bag of peppermint patties.</TE>

<HD>Many Real Men Have Unreal Fears About Vasectomies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first thing Ian Tresman wanted to know when he decided to have a
vasectomy was what the operation was like for a regular guy who'd
been through it. To the distress of the 41-year-old Web page
designer, all the information he found about vasectomies on the Web,
in bookstores and in libraries read like medical journal entries.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a quite a big decision to even consider a vasectomy," said
Tresman, who lives outside London with his wife and his two daughters
from a previous marriage. "I wanted to know what it was like from a
personal point of view.... Reading about it in textbooks is not quite
the same."</LD>
<LD>   Tresman, who had a vasectomy in February 2001, decided to go
public with his own story for the good of mankind and mankind's
respective partners. Thus was born www.my-vasectomy.com, a Web site
that, "in words and pictures," documents his surgery through all the
stages (photos are rated on a "squeamish" scale of 1 to 10).</LD>
<TE>   Tresman's wife, Caroline, took the photographs, which are
accompanied by his written account of the procedure. Comic relief
punctuates the medical-school-style photographs in the form of
vasectomy jokes. For example: A man visits his doctor to inquire
about a vasectomy and the doctor asks whether he's talked it over
with his family: "Yeah," he responds. "They're in favor, 15 to 2."</TE>
<TE>   The decision to have a vasectomy is no small matter, as it must be
considered irrevocable. Although urologists sometimes perform
reversals, there are no guarantees of success. Roughly half a million
U.S. men receive vasectomies a year. Most of them are white; black
and Latino men receive the fewest vasectomies, according to Planned
Parenthood Federation of America.</TE>
<TE>   Complications are rare from the procedure, which blocks the vas
deferens, the tubes that carry sperm during ejaculation, according to
the American Medical Assn. Of every 1,000 men sterilized, fewer than
two will cause pregnancy in the first year. It takes about 15
ejaculations to eliminate the sperm that remain in a man's system
after the operation.</TE>
<TE>   Sexual functioning is usually unchanged following a vasectomy,
according to the AMA. And there's an added benefit: Most men report
experiencing enhanced sexual pleasure because fears of unwanted
pregnancy are relinquished, according to the AMA and urologists. In
the rare cases when men lose sexual desire or sexual function,
doctors say, it usually has to do with emotional issues present
before the vasectomy.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, many men approach vasectomies fraught with fear. "It
did cross my mind [after the surgery] that maybe all the textbooks
are wrong and the vasectomy could have some effect on my performance
in the sexual arena or on my ability to go to the loo," Tresman said.
"But I figured that if that had been the result, I would have heard
about it from other men. Most men are afraid of it because it is an
operation that is down there, and men are a bit attached to down
there."</TE>
<TE>   But will a vasectomy cause impotence? "They all ask the same
question in a different way," said Jacob Rajfer, a professor of
urology at UCLA School of Medicine. "Will I become impotent? Will I
be less of a man than I was before? When you say, 'This will make you
sterile' to some men, the perception is not only will they not be
able to father children, but some other functions may not work the
way they did before. Sterile connotes something more to some men than
what it actually is. It is equating manliness with that organ and
what it has to do when asked to perform."</TE>
<TE>   Jokes and double-entendres about vasectomies ruining male potency
may override medical information that shows overwhelmingly they
don't, said Rajfer. "It takes a lot to squelch these myths."</TE>
<TE>   Psychological reasons for sexual dysfunction can be as varied as
the men themselves, said Steve Lipsius, a psychiatrist and certified
sexual-dysfunction therapist based in Washington, D.C. Men suffering
from a lack of sexual pleasure, which could stem from performance
anxiety or other, deeper reasons, may lay blame on a recent
vasectomy, he said. Some men use sex to validate their masculinity
rather than for pleasure, Lipsius said. An underlying element of the
sexual experience for such men might include reproductive potency.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that being masculine has to do with being able to
impregnate a woman, a man might experience erectile dysfunction and
unfairly blame it on a vasectomy," Lipsius said.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, urologists have pre-operative consultations with men who
are considering a vasectomy, with their respective partners. Single
men also seek vasectomies but urologists usually advise them to have
a surgery known as an open-ended vasectomy, which is easier to
reverse.</TE>
<TE>   During a vasectomy, urologists have the option to either close
both ends of the severed vas deferens--the traditional method--or to
leave the testicular end open, hence the term open-ended.</TE>
<TE>   Urologists usually advise couples to think of vasectomy as
irreversible, a "final solution." Men who have not fathered children
or who are concerned about unforeseen tragedies that could result in
the loss of children or a wife are also encouraged to consider the
open-ended vasectomy.</TE>
<TE>   Since the late 1970s, improved microsurgical techniques have made
sterilization reversal possible, although only about 10% of men seek
reversal. Not surprisingly, many reversals are sought by men in
second marriages to younger women.</TE>
<TE>   A Danish survey conducted in 1990-91 found that 7% of the 244 men
who had been sterilized eight to 10 years earlier regretted their
decision. Nearly all of those with regrets had started a relationship
with another woman.</TE>
<TE>   Both partners in a relationship should agree that a vasectomy is
the right decision, said Arnold Belker, a urologist in Lexington, Ky.
"My first question to a couple sitting across from me is, 'Whose idea
was this?'" he said. "I have heard a woman say, 'I told him to get
this done or don't come near me.' I recommended that they get
counseling, not a vasectomy."</TE>
<TE>   The best scenarios are with couples who feel they have enough
children, who agree that a vasectomy is the right choice and who are
all too happy to be free of the burdens of birth control.</TE>
<TE>   "I was happy as a lark," said Ray Lack, a building contractor who
lives in Westchester with his wife and two children. "We had a boy
and a girl and we were in our late 30s. I was just blessed and
thought let's go from here and get it done."</TE>
<TE>   As for reports of enhanced spontaneous sexual romps after
vasectomies (call it the honeymoon period), the Lacks, who pursued a
vasectomy when their second child was 6 months old, report that with
a new baby and work, they were too worn out for that.</TE>
<TE>   But Tresman has this to say about his post-op sexual forays: "As
for sex, it's pretty much when you like it next. But three days after
the op, we managed to test [apprehensively] that everything was
functioning satisfactorily. Hooray! ... And now three months on,
libido is unchanged ... looks and feels exactly the same as before."</TE>

<LD>A DOUBLE THREAD</LD>
<LD>   Growing Up English and Jewish</LD>
<LD>   in London</LD>
<TE>   By John Gross</TE>
<TE>   Ivan R. Dee</TE>
<TE>   192 pages, $23.50</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Memoirs come in many shapes and colors: discreet or indiscreet,
impressionistic or precise, nostalgic or vindictive. A memoir may
often be an account of its author's acquaintance with a famous
figure. Most memoirs written nowadays, however, are stories of their
authors' childhood and development: nonfiction versions of the
classic Bildungsroman. Such is the case with "A Double Thread," John
Gross' evocative and thoughtful recollections of a boyhood in England
during the years before, during and after World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Currently theater critic of the (London) Sunday Telegraph and,
before that, the editor of the prestigious Times Literary Supplement,
Gross grew up in London's East End, where his father practiced
medicine. The title of his book, "A Double Thread," refers to two
traditions that informed his emerging identity: English and Jewish.
His family were observant, Orthodox Jews. But the larger world
surrounding him was English. "The contrast between these two worlds
... ran deep," he muses, "... Yet I can't recall being especially
troubled by this dual destiny. What it principally suggested was not
so much conflict as inconsistency." And inconsistency, while
occasionally a source of puzzlement, served to propel him in the
direction of moderation, fair-mindedness and common sense.</TE>
<TE>   Gross' experience of growing up in two different, but not
incompatible, worlds led him to distrust the temptation to frame
questions in the dramatic, Kierkegaardian mode of either/or. He
recalls, for example, feeling troubled by "the apparent iron logic of
Arthur Koestler, who began arguing ... that, now that Jews had their
own state, they were faced with a simple choice. If they wanted to
remain Jews, they should go to Israel; otherwise they should forget
the whole thing. The only reply I could think of was that life wasn't
like that, that people are inconsistent."</TE>
<TE>   Whether he is discussing his reactions to Bible stories, his
experiences of anti-Semitism, his notions about romance and sex, his
understanding of politics or his response to literary Modernism, what
most strikes a reader is Gross' capacity for what Keats called
"negative capability": the ability to remain in a state of
uncertainty rather than pressing for a quick "solution" to a complex
problem. This judiciousness does not prevent him from making
judgments; rather, it lends weight and substance to his ideas and
opinions.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, his first 17 years were full of dualities, not only
between Englishness and Jewishness. Even the comic books he enjoyed
were of diverse origin, some English, some American. Childhood itself
seemed to incorporate at least two forms of consciousness: the one,
imaginative and romantic; the other, mundane and rote. Children's
lives, he observes, are divided "between inner and outer worlds,
between private thoughts or imaginings and the common currency of
classroom, playground and street. An unrepeatable innocence coexists
with scruffy experience." "War," he recalls, "was all around. It
seeped into every corner of life....And yet I am also struck, looking
back, by the extent to which it didn't impinge on my own small
world." Gross' personal experiences of anti-Semitism were few and far
between. Yet he grew deeply aware of the horrors being perpetrated
against the Jews of Europe. Ironically, this young lover of
literature was to encounter more instances of anti-Semitism in
literature than in his personal life.</TE>
<TE>   Gross finds it hard to recall a time in his life when he wasn't
beset by doubts about religion: "Where was the evidence?" But
although strongly attracted to the skepticism of thinkers like David
Hume, Gross did not abandon his faith: "Much of my continuing
readiness to believe, and to pray, was based on loyalty ... to the
'little platoon' in which I had been born....But religion retained my
allegiance on broader grounds, too.... It seemed to me that without
the realm of religious experience, life would be a thinner and poorer
thing.... Wavering became a way of life...."</TE>
<TE>   There's also a kind of dual consciousness that comes with
summoning up memories, and Gross' book beautifully exemplifies this.
On one hand, he does his best to re-create the way things seemed to
him then, while on the other, he takes care to put his youthful
impressions in the context of what he has come to know as an adult.
Intelligent, humane, highly civilized, yet utterly unpretentious, the
voice we hear not only holds our attention but also wins our
affection and respect.</TE>

<HD>Mideast Views to Make Us Squirm</HD>
<DH>Media: A British reporter finds much to fault in U.S.
leadership, news accounts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLAN M. JALON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In December, British reporter Robert Fisk's car broke down at the
village of Kila Abdullah, near the Pakistani-Afghan border. A crowd
of Afghan refugees kicked and hit him, and soon started to smash
stones into his face. "I couldn't see for the blood pouring down my
forehead and swamping my eyes," he would write after his narrow
escape.</LD>
<LD>   He was sure his assailants' rage sprang from seeing their nearby
village destroyed by American B-52s, he recently told a riveted
audience at Chapman University in Orange County. And two days after
the incident, he filed a passionately sympathetic view of the
"humiliation and misery" of the Muslim world. "If I was an Afghan
refugee in Kila Abdullah, I would have done just what they did," he
wrote for the Dec. 10 edition of his paper, London's Independent. "I
would have attacked Robert Fisk. Or any other Westerner I could
find."</LD>
<LD>   To fans in Britain and on the Internet, where a growing worldwide
readership stalks his work daily, the piece was an extreme case of
Fisk being Fisk: A highly personal response to conflict, conveyed
with a cinematic intimacy that makes it hard to put down. A Wall
Street Journal pundit, Fisk asserts, demonstrated just what kind of
response his approach provokes. The Journal article was headlined: "A
Self-Loathing Multiculturalist Gets His Due."</LD>
<TE>   "Had I merely reported an attack by a mob," he told the Chapman
crowd, "the story would have fitted neatly into the general American
media presentation of the Afghan war, no reference to civilian deaths
from American B-52 bombers and the widespread casualties of the
Afghan raids.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate the 'what' and 'where' stories that leave out the 'why.'"</TE>
<TE>   Like Fisk or not, the Sept. 11 attacks in New York and at the
Pentagon turned events on his beat as the Independent's Middle East
correspondent into the biggest story on the globe. He became
increasingly familiar in print and on radio as one of the few Western
reporters to have interviewed Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   He's put in 26 years covering the Middle East, as well as
conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and Northern Ireland, winning the
British international journalist of the year award seven times. He's
covered the Iranian revolution, the Iran-Iraq war, the Persian Gulf
War, the Arab-Israeli conflict and the current U.S. action in
Afghanistan. "He's a legend in Britain," says Anne Nelson, who uses
his work to teach international reporting at the Columbia Graduate
School of Journalism.</TE>
<TE>   Between April 12 and 14, as the region's wounds seemed to grow
wider by the hour, he gave a hectic series of talks around Los
Angeles, drawing packed crowds and strongly divided reactions.</TE>
<TE>   In his five local appearances, he performed a geopolitical shtick
that included throwing out the phrase "peace process" with such
sarcasm it sounded like punch line. He's a restless, compact,
56-year-old man with a ruddy face that gets redder when he's worked
up, flaring with Swiftian scorn for one form of organized or state
power after another.</TE>
<TE>   He savages "cynical, old" Arafat, "cynical" Colin Powell,
"murderous" Ariel Sharon, America's "blindly unquestioning" support
of Israel and "corrupt, dreadful" Arab dictators (whom he says
America supports, even installs). Fisk, who speaks Arabic, derides
the duplicity of the British for making conflicting promises to Arabs
and Jews that he says started much of the area's modern trouble.</TE>
<TE>   He is driven by a preoccupation with history. "I am fascinated by
European history," he says in an interview, "and the history of the
Middle East is European history."</TE>
<TE>   Having studied classics and Irish political history, Fisk holds a
doctorate from Trinity College in Dublin. His interest in European
history started when his father, a British veteran of World War I (he
joined up early, was in his late 40s when Fisk was born), took him on
tours of European battlefields when he was no older than 5. "I'd
visited Auschwitz by the time I was 16," he says."</TE>
<TE>   Journalists, he says, "are usually the first witnesses to history,
and we're usually the first independent witnesses to history, so
there is a kind of duty in that. You are saying, 'Here is what I saw,
here is what happened: Don't ever say no one told you.'"</TE>
<TE>   Fisk's talks sound like his pieces--a blend of reportage,
political analysis, history and media criticism, combined in the
essayistic approach of the British press. One of his regular themes
is his charge that the American media outlets "dishonestly skew and
soften" their coverage of the Middle East. (The Arab press, he says,
is "just awful.")</TE>
<TE>   He lobbed verbal hand grenades at TV and print outlets alike. The
tours, he says, are fun, and he also views them as Middle Eastern
coverage, since "America is part of the story of the Middle East."
After he flew home to Beirut on April 14, he whipped off a piece
about his seven-day excursion from Chicago to Iowa City, Iowa, to Los
Angeles during a terrible week when suicide bombers and Israel's
incursion on the West Bank led every night's news.</TE>
<TE>   His 4,000-word report for the Independent went up on the
publication's Web site (www.independent.co.uk) Wednesday. Called
"Fear and Learning in America," it gives a map for what draws Fisk's
admirers and provokes his detractors.</TE>
<TE>   "The theme of my lectures," he writes with typical pungency, was
"the idle, spineless way in which American journalists are
lobotomizing their stories from the Middle East, how the 'occupied
territories' have become 'disputed territories' in their reports, how
Jewish 'settlements' have been transformed into Jewish
'neighborhoods,' how Arab militants are 'terrorists' but Israeli
militants only 'fanatics' or 'extremists.'"</TE>
<TE>   Fisk sardonically diagnoses words as if they were germs of
dishonesty and violence. A speech at USC stressed this kind of
examination; a talk at Beyond Baroque in Venice more directly
expressed his outrage at current events.</TE>
<TE>   "Why doesn't Colin Powell go to Jenin?" he asked, noting that
Powell had made a flyover of the West Bank site where a Palestinian
suicide bomber had destroyed herself and six others, wounding 65
more. "What has happened to the world's moral compass, indeed to the
United States, when America's most famous ex-general, the secretary
of state of the most powerful country on earth, on a supposedly
desperate mission to stop the bloodshed in the Middle East, fails to
grasp what is taking place in front of his nose?"</TE>
<TE>   The answer was that "this is the very final proof that the United
States is not morally worthy  of being a Middle East peacemaker."</TE>
<TE>   Among those at Beyond Baroque was Gene Lichtenstein, former editor
of the Jewish Journal, a weekly that is influential in the Jewish
community. After listening to Fisk's April 13 lecture, he wrote a
column for the Journal that asked why more local Jewish leaders had
not come. Fisk, Lichtenstein said in an interview, "is someone who
has followed the Mideast and is British and therefore has a very
different take on things. He does not make the assumptions about
Israel that we do, or about Arabs. A lot of what he had to say was
worthwhile."</TE>
<TE>   Other supporters of Israel are not so sure.</TE>
<TE>   At two of Fisk's Los Angeles presentations, he showed part of a TV
documentary he made called "Beirut to Bosnia," which was shown on the
Discovery Channel in 1994. Audiences at Chapman and USC watched
images of massive buildings overlooking a lone farm owned by a
Palestinian family forced, Fisk reports in the voice-over, "to cling
onto [its] own land in the face of Israel's expanding settlements."</TE>
<TE>   At the time it first aired, the documentary drew fire from Andrea
Levin, who wrote on a Web site that monitors Middle East coverage
that the film amounted to "ruthless promotion of his personal
hostility toward Israel."</TE>
<TE>   To Samir Twair, a Syrian-born American who listened to Fisk at
USC, the message resonated differently. "I don't believe he is
pro-Palestinian," says Twair, a freelance reporter and past president
of the Arab-American Press Guild. "When I hear him," he says, "he is
just an honest reporter."</TE>
<TE>   Fisk's fearless, if sometimes polarizing, iconoclasm is
inseparable from his knack for charting his own course through a
story. He wins high marks among critics of contemporary journalism.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of reporters and editors don't like competition," explains
John R. MacArthur, author the book "Second Front: Censorship and
Propaganda in the Gulf War" and publisher of Harper's magazine. "They
would rather have everybody get the same story. That is the
bureaucratic approach to journalism that tends to rule today, and he
is extraordinary because he insists on doing it his way."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Hedges, a reporter for the New York Times who has covered
stories with Fisk on and off for 10 years and is a friend, says Fisk
"always knows what the next day's story will be."</TE>
<TE>   Hedges recalled that Fisk predicted immediately after the 1993
Oslo peace agreement between Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin that it
would fail. "Even I thought he was wacky, that it might work," Hedges
said, in an interview from New York. "But he was right."</TE>
<TE>   During a drive between L.A. venues, Fisk said that he's made more
than 40 speaking tours of the U.S. Compared to audiences in Canada or
Ireland, those here generally seemed ill-informed and marginally
interested. That's changed.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans were always the worst," he says. "I've never before,
until this trip, come across audiences so potentially angry with
events and so unanimous that they're not being told the truth by the
American media."</TE>
<TE>   There was an obvious hunger for hope in many who asked Fisk
questions. At Beyond Baroque, a questioner asked why the Palestinians
didn't try Gandhi-style, nonviolent resistance to Israel. Fisk stared
into the audience and bluntly stated that, in the face of Israel's
military power, "it just would not work."</TE>
<TE>   At the Westside home of Stanley Sheinbaum, a businessman and
longtime activist for peace in the Middle East, Fisk faced a smaller,
largely Jewish audience. Vigorous applause followed, but several
questioners turned sharply critical.</TE>
<TE>   Hearing Fisk proclaim that the pro-Israel lobby in Washington
inhibits American policy, Judith Hirshberg raised her hand. Lobbying
by oil-producing Arab states, she said, had more influence,
especially under the Bush administration. She said afterward that she
felt Fisk "gave a lot of answers, but never really answered the
question." Roberta Seid said after the talk that she thought he
"demonizes Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Sheinbaum, however, bade farewell to his guests saying that Fisk's
insights "should be heard around the world."</TE>
<TE>   The foreign correspondent returned from the American front and
filed his reflections. The unusually engaged crowds that turned out
to hear all his bad news yielded a rare dispatch of good news. "Osama
bin Laden told me he thought Americans didn't understand the Middle
East," Fisk wrote. "Maybe he was right then. But not anymore."</TE>

<HD>The Jewish Joke--It's Humor With a History</HD>
<DH>Not just for laughs, four funny men banter about their
distinct brand of comedy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What makes a joke told by a Jewish comedian different from all other
jokes?</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes not much--funny is funny. Sometimes, a lot, thanks to a
rich joke-telling tradition that reaches back decades to the
vaudeville acts working the Catskill Mountains, and centuries to
Eastern Europe. A self-defense mechanism against anti-Semitism,
Jewish jokes typically demonstrate a skillful use of language,
frequently focus upon the comedian's personal problems, and almost
always contain a strong element of alienation.</LD>
<LD>   That's one of the more serious conclusions reached last week by a
quartet of distinguished Jewish funny men--Jerry Stiller, Shecky
Greene, Shelley Berman and relative newcomer Jeffrey Ross--who were
participating in an ongoing author series sponsored by the nonprofit
group Writers Bloc.</LD>
<TE>   When not launching into another joke, one-liner or put-down, the
foursome were kept, somewhat successfully, on a more scholarly track
by de facto straight men Barry Glassner, a USC sociologist, and
Lawrence Epstein, author of "The Haunted Smile: The Story of Jewish
Comedians in America."</TE>
<TE>   "If you got Gentiles to laugh," said Epstein to a
standing-room-only crowd at Temple Emanuel in Beverly Hills, "they
weren't going to go after your throat."</TE>
<TE>   Berman, an actor, playwright and comedian since the 1950s who now
teaches humor writing at USC, offered this classic Jewish joke:</TE>
<TE>   "For the three Jews out there that haven't heard this one," began
Berman, slipping in a hint of a Yiddish accent at the appropriate
times. "An old man is dying. He smells something wonderful. He says
to his son, 'Sheldon, Sheldon, what is that wonderful smell?' Sheldon
says, 'Ma is baking a honey cake.' The dying old man says, 'Oh,
Sheldon, go tell Ma I want a piece of honey cake.' Sheldon runs off.
He comes back a few minutes later and says, 'Ma says it's for
after.'"</TE>
<TE>   Huge laughs from the heavily Jewish audience whose average age
probably hovered around 60. Once he got going, Berman was on a roll.
"The Irishman says, 'I'm so tired, I'm so thirsty, I want a whiskey.'
The Jew says, 'I'm so tired, I'm so thirsty, I must have diabetes.'"</TE>
<TE>   Not to be outdone, Greene, who made his reputation as a Vegas
nightclub act, got a few off too. "Frank Sinatra saved my life in
1967," said Greene, who has appeared on dozens of television shows
ranging from "The Love Boat" to "Northern Exposure." "Five guys were
beating me up, and Frank said, 'That's enough.'"</TE>
<TE>   But the further jokes strayed from Jewish roots, the fewer laughs
they seemed to elicit. At one point, Ross--a comic popular on
late-night television and Comedy Central--interrupted one of the
panelists to announce he had to go to the bathroom. (He used more
graphic language.)</TE>
<TE>   These days, a plot like "young comic interrupts elders to go to
the bathroom" could get a guy a development deal at a major studio,
but this mature crowd wasn't in on the joke. When Ross returned with
a toilet-seat cover around his neck, there were some laughs, but
nothing compared with Greene's shticky imitation of 1930s film star
Wallace Beery.</TE>
<TE>   But the night wasn't just about laughs. It carried a fair amount
of insight and introspection, particularly when it came to how
Jewishness influenced comedy.</TE>
<TE>   Stiller, best known these days for his grumpy father characters on
"Seinfeld" and "King of Queens," talked about the importance of his
marriage to actress Ann Meara. Stiller credited Meara's decision to
convert to Judaism for finally getting him to fully embrace his
religion, something that would benefit him personally, spiritually
and professionally.</TE>
<TE>   When you're his age, Stiller said, and you're trying to memorize
lines for something like "Seinfeld," which change daily, it helps to
pray.</TE>
<TE>   Stiller went on to relate a vivid memory about being Jewish and
funny. He was 12 years old on the way home from temple. Suddenly, he
was surrounded by a bunch of kids. One asked if he were Jewish, and
Stiller replied that he was.</TE>
<TE>   "You killed our Lord," said the boy.</TE>
<TE>   Without missing a beat, Stiller remembers replying: "Would you
like a stick of gum? I chew Wrigley's."</TE>
<TE>   Stiller's wit allowed him to escape a tense situation.</TE>
<TE>   "Humor was sometimes a way that you not only deflected
anti-Semitism," he said, "but people started liking you."</TE>

<LD>What's the grossest thing in the world? Your body! We may look pretty
good in a mirror, but like it or not, the human body can gross you
out on a moment's notice. We burp, we pass gas, we have runny noses
and do all sorts of other things. But however gross these things may
be, they are all vital functions of the human body.</LD>
<LD>   One of the most important fluids in our body is mucus. Mucus is
made mostly of sugar and protein. Among other things, it protects the
lining of your stomach. Without it, you'd digest yourself.</LD>
<LD>   Your stomach makes hydrochloric acid, which is strong enough to
eat through some metals. Hydrochloric acid helps break down proteins
and get rid of the nasty germs that may have been in your food.</LD>
<TE>   With some help from an adult, you can make a batch of fake mucus
following this safe, organic recipe:</TE>
<TE>   What You Need: Microwave oven or stove, large bowl, water,
unflavored gelatin, fork, light corn syrup, measuring cup, water and
an adult.</TE>
<TE>   Step 1: Ask an adult to heat  1/2 cup of water in a bowl until it
boils, then remove it from the microwave or stove.</TE>
<TE>   Step 2: Sprinkle in three envelopes of unflavored gelatin.</TE>
<TE>   Step 3: Let it sit for a few minutes, then stir with a fork.</TE>
<TE>   Step 4: Stir in enough corn syrup to make about 1 cup of goop.</TE>
<TE>   Step 5: Add more water as it cools, spoonful by spoonful, until it
becomes as thick as pancake batter.</TE>
<TE>   After it cools, put your hands in the mixture. Let it coat your
fingers. Does it feel a little gross? How do you think goop like this
protects the lining of your stomach?</TE>
<TE>   You can learn more about mucus and other bodily functions at
Discovery Science Center's "Gross Me Out!" show, Saturdays through
June 2. For more information call (714) 542-CUBE or visit

<LD>The Profile of a Witch</LD>
<LD>   "The Witches"</LD>
<LD>   By Roald Dahl</LD>
<TE>   Have you ever seen a witch? You probably haven't recognized one.
Here are some tips.</TE>
<TE>   All witches are bald, but they wear wigs. They also have blue
saliva, but they never spit. They always wear gloves since their
nails are so long. And the worst thing of all is their huge nostrils,
so they can smell children, their enemies!</TE>
<TE>   I recommend this book because it is funny and well-written.</TE>

<TE>   "Maniac Magee"</TE>
<TE>   By Jerry Spinelli</TE>
<TE>   Funny and sad, this book is great. Maniac Magee is an orphan who
lives on the streets. He meets all kinds of adults and kids. Maniac
gets into jams but always gets out in one piece. He lives with one
family, then in a deer pen, then with another family, and so on.</TE>
<TE>   Will he always get out of his jams in one piece? What family will
he finally live with? Find out in "Maniac Magee."</TE>

<HD>Seeking Justice for Slavery's Sins</HD>
<DH>A class-action suit pursuing reparations from companies
began with a woman's personal quest to understand history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS BEALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Forty acres and a mule. We were supposed to get 40 acres and a mule.
It always sounded like a myth to Deadria Farmer-Paellmann, a kind of
urban legend black people told one another. Like when her grandfather
would occasionally complain about some sort of government injustice
and invariably end his grumbling by saying " ... and they still owe
us our 40 acres and a mule."</LD>
<LD>   Yet Farmer-Paellmann eventually learned that what her grandfather
was talking about wasn't folklore. He was referring to an 1865 field
order issued by Civil War Gen. William T. Sherman, which granted
freed slaves a piece of land and the means to work it--a promise that
was broken and has come to symbolize a debt owed to the descendants
of slaves by an indifferent government.</LD>
<LD>   Once Farmer-Paellmann learned the truth about the "40 acres and a
mule" mantra, she wanted to learn more. Driven by what she calls an
"Afrocentric consciousness," Farmer-Paellmann began to research
slavery and to learn all she could about the businesses that played a
prominent role in the slave trade.</LD>
<TE>   Her work took her to musty state historical archives, where she
dug around for insurance policies written on slave lives and other
documentation of corporate culpability. The search also took her to
law school, where Farmer-Paellmann tailored a curriculum that would
help her devise a strategy to get reparations for the descendants of
millions of enslaved Africans.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, five years after beginning her research,
Farmer-Paellmann's efforts bore fruit. A class-action lawsuit, the
first of its kind, was filed in Brooklyn federal court seeking
compensation from three American companies that allegedly profited
from the slave trade.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit singles out FleetBoston Financial Corp., Aetna Inc.
and CSX Corp., alleging that they or their predecessor companies
profited from slave labor. The lawsuit seeks to link these
companies--involved in banking, insurance and transportation--in a
conspiracy to deprive Africans of their human rights through
enslavement.</TE>
<TE>   It is one of several similar lawsuits to be filed in the coming
weeks and months, including at least one to be filed before the end
of May in Los Angeles involving an insurance company, a bank and a
tobacco firm. And although the lawsuit does not ask for any specific
amount in damages, the plaintiffs plan to seek to hold settlement
talks with a number of companies, several of which are not named in
the Brooklyn suit. Ultimately, the plaintiffs would like to set up a
trust fund to be used to address pressing issues in the African
American community, such as education and health care.</TE>
<TE>   "The perpetrators of the crimes committed against Africans are
still here," says Farmer-Paellmann, who is the lead plaintiff in the
suit, and whose research is at the core of its allegations. "They
profited from stealing people and labor, torturing and raping women
to breed children. Why on earth should they be able to keep profits
they made committing those crimes?"</TE>
<TE>   The New York woman's legal action is the latest example of a
grass-roots campaign that dates to the 1890s, when an organization
called the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Assn.
pushed for legislation granting pensions to ex-slaves.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years the issue has been discussed fervently among
lawyers, historians and activists and, since 1989, Rep. John Conyers
(D-Mich.) has introduced a bill each year that would establish a
national commission to study the issue (the bill has never gotten out
of committee). But the concept of slave reparations has especially
gained momentum following the awarding of compensation to Holocaust
survivors by profiting firms, and, by the U.S. government to Japanese
Americans interned during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   The slave reparations case, says Ed Fagan, one of
Farmer-Paellmann's lawyers and a prominent player in the recent
Holocaust settlements involving German companies and Swiss banks, "is
about companies being held accountable for what they did. They should
not be entitled to retain the illegal profit they made." Fagan says
the Holocaust settlements amounted to $8 billion to $10 billion in
claims owed about 1 million people.</TE>
<TE>   Some see the slave reparations lawsuits as seriously flawed,
though. Richard H. Middleton Jr., a specialist in class-action
lawsuits and past president of the Assn. of Trial Lawyers of America,
says: "There's a huge problem [with the lawsuit] in justification in
terms of the public perception of what this lawsuit is about. Because
of the long time period that has elapsed, it will be hard to identify
proper beneficiaries, and it might be hard for the parties being sued
to defend themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Farmer-Paellmann is not worried about how the courts will view the
legal issues raised in her lawsuit. And she is no wild-eyed radical
filing what she knows is a ridiculous claim solely to make a
political point.</TE>
<TE>   Showing up for an interview at the trendy W Hotel in Union Square,
Farmer-Paellmann, 36, is stylishly dressed, well-spoken and low key.
She is a graduate of Boston's New England School of Law, but has not
yet qualified for the bar.</TE>
<TE>   She and her husband, a German national who heads up investor
relations for a foreign company, have a 20-month-old daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer-Paellmann's commitment to the reparations issue developed
over a long period of time. She grew up in low-income neighborhoods,
both black and white. Her interest was piqued because of her
grandfather's comments, then gained momentum after reading a Malcolm
X interview that referred to the debt owed African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   But it was while she was working to help save a slave burial
ground that had been uncovered in lower Manhattan that the subject
took on real immediacy.</TE>
<TE>   "There was something really particular about being at the site and
seeing the burials, the skeletal remains," she says. "And some of the
faces looked like they were screaming when they died. That was really
moving to me."</TE>
<TE>   Farmer-Paellmann had always had a political bent; she majored in
political science at Brooklyn College and briefly attended George
Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management.
Always interested in the law, she decided to pursue a law degree in
order to further the reparations cause.</TE>
<TE>   So while attending law school, she deliberately chose several
courses that could help with her objective: modern remedies, dealing
with the area of law known as restitution; constitutional law;
contract law; international law, focusing on human rights law; and
race and the law.</TE>
<TE>   It was in the race-and-law class that Farmer-Paellmann first
studied Cato vs. U.S., a 1995 case in which the plaintiffs tried to
sue the U.S. government for reparations but were shot down by the
courts. Farmer-Paellmann recognized the inherent difficulty of suing
the government so she began to wonder "who else owes reparations
besides the government, and that's when I started looking at
corporations and private estates."</TE>
<TE>   The research began. A book on black genealogy mentioned slave
insurance policies, which led Farmer-Paellmann to Aetna and other
companies. Using computer databases, she found out which antebellum
companies involved in the slave trade survived into this era; she
discovered at least 60.</TE>
<TE>   Further digging revealed Rhode Island to be a treasure trove of
information since some of the country's biggest slave traders came
from that state. So Farmer-Paellmann started digging among the papers
of the Rhode Island and New England historical societies.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in January 2000, Farmer-Paellmann wrote to Aetna asking
for copies of its slave policies. The company complied, and
Farmer-Paellmann asked Aetna for an apology and restitution.</TE>
<TE>   "They were enthusiastic. They had no reason to not be," she says.
"I did not approach them in an adversarial way. I said to them this
is a great opportunity for you to do something really positive. There
was no negativity in it."</TE>
<TE>   Aetna did apologize for past business practices, but the company
retracted its restitution offer, which was, says Farmer-Paellmann, to
be in the form of college scholarships. It was around this time that
Farmer-Paellmann decided to pursue litigation, a course she was not
really keen on.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought this could be dealt with through a grass-roots
approach," she says. "But I was approached by lawyers who said these
companies are not really forthcoming on things like this. They said
very often these companies might want to pay, but they're more
willing to pay in the context of litigation, because there's
finality."</TE>
<TE>   (Responding to the recent lawsuit, Aetna released a statement
saying: "We do not believe a court would permit a lawsuit over events
which--however regrettable--occurred hundreds of years ago. These
issues in no way reflect Aetna today.")</TE>
<TE>   Farmer-Paellmann knows she's fighting an uphill battle, but she's
confident about the course she's taken and has quick responses for
all of her critics. Some claim the case is dead in the water because
the statute of limitations has passed; she says there is no statute
of limitations for human-rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   Others say the case is bogus because you can't sue for actions
that were legal at the time; well, says Farmer-Paellmann, the
Japanese internment was legal in its time. Then there are those who
rail that "slavery was abolished 137 years ago. Get over it." Or the
folks who tell her that "you people" are always trying to get money
out of the government, and if African Americans can sue over slavery,
why can't Armenians sue Turks, and Irish the English, ad infinitum,
ad nauseum?</TE>
<TE>   "The Constitution allows everyone their day in court,"
Farmer-Paellmann says. "Just because other people may have claims
against other groups of people doesn't mean I should not vindicate
the rights of my ancestors."</TE>
<TE>   Farmer-Paellmann and her lawyers are also emphatic about one other
point. These lawsuits are not a public relations gesture meant to
create some sort of national soul-searching about the slavery issue.
The object is twofold: to get an apology and some measure of
compensation.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is important for the dialogue to take place," says
Farmer-Paellmann, "but I think it is also important for the atonement
to take place."</TE>

<LD>Maria and her younger brother Alfonso were on a picnic with their
Uncle Ruben, high in the mountains of Southern California. Uncle
Ruben, a nature guide in the San Bernardino National Forest, knew all
the hiking trails and good picnic spots.</LD>
<LD>   As they hiked to the picnic area overlooking the stream, Maria saw
some discarded aluminum soda cans lying by the side of the trail.</LD>
<LD>   Uncle Ruben pointed to the litter and said, "The person who did
this was very unthoughtful. I hope you children never leave a mess
behind after you have a picnic."</LD>
<TE>   "We won't," they replied in unison.</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben flattened all the cans but one, and put them in his
pack.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll get money for the aluminum at the recycling center," Uncle
Ruben said.</TE>
<TE>   "Why didn't you crush that can?" Maria asked, pointing to the one
in Uncle Ruben's hand.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, children, have you ever heard the expression, 'One man's
trash is another's treasure'? It means you can often find value in
what others throw away. And I can turn this can into a lantern."</TE>
<TE>   "Wow," Alfonso said. "Really?"</TE>
<TE>   The children sat on the ground with Uncle Ruben as he pulled out
his pocket knife. He cut the soft aluminum can from top to bottom on
one side. Then at the top and bottom of the slit, he cut two more
slits, each horizontal. Then he folded open what appeared to be two
"doors."</TE>
<TE>   "See," he said. "Now I just put my candle inside, like so, and
presto, I have a lantern. I can hang it in a tree by the pop-tab and
the wind will actually turn the lantern so the candle won't blow
out."</TE>
<TE>   "Cooool," Maria said. "You're a genius. Now we can tell our
parents how to do this. We sure like going on picnics with you."</TE>

<LD>The WWF, the World Wrestling Federation, may have the Rock, but the
LAWF, the Los Angeles Women's Foundation, had the Rocky--as in City
Atty. Delgadillo. Women swooned over the handsome, hulking lawyer as
he strutted the catwalk Thursday night. The "Walk the Talk" fashion
show raised more than $250,000 for the women's and girls' charities
supported by the group.</LD>
<LD>   Delgadillo and 39 prominent Angelenos--including Sheriff Lee Baca,
Judge Stephen Reinhardt of the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals and
Antonio Villaraigosa, speaker emeritus of the California State
Assembly--traded in their uniforms, robes and corporate suits for
designer looks provided by Saks Fifth Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   After chowing down dinner, the men headed backstage at the
Millennium Biltmore Hotel in downtown L.A. A few dressed in the
open--revealing tattoo-free bodies, no body piercing and a love
handle or two--claiming a corner spot or by the racks where Saks'
employees eagerly assisted.</LD>
<TE>   Baca was one who casually stripped down to his briefs, revealing a
hairy chest on his fat-free, 154-pound, 6-foot-1 physique--clearly a
fit man. Some didn't even mind a powder puff of makeup or a glob of
hair gel, courtesy of makeup artist James Higgins. Among them, a trio
of formers: Mayor Richard Riordan, Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner and
Councilman Michael Woo. "But mostly, they all want Altoids," Higgins
said.</TE>
<TE>   Others chatted about "the walk" on the runway, mostly seeking
tips. Christopher Hammond, a housing developer, said his wife,
Ayahlushim, gave him a mantra: "Do not fall. Do not become fashion
road kill." Rob Maguire III, founder and managing partner of a
property investment firm, confessed to practicing "my twirls and
swirls all week." Bertram Fields, a Hollywood attorney said, "I've
had a glass of wine to work the nerves."</TE>
<TE>   But once the show took off, humorously emceed by state Sen. Sheila
Kuehl (D-Santa Monica), the men emerged like a confident army from
the pages of GQ. They strutted and sashayed, posed and pivoted. Many
flung jackets over shoulders, revealing Pillsbury Doughboy
paunches--and a price tag here and there--and then sauntered off,
trying to ooze sex appeal.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the high jinks on the runway that captivated the 550
guests.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of women--including California's first lady, Sharon
Davis, and Kathleen Brown, former state treasurer--hooted wildly
("Over here, baby!") and applauded loudly for their favorites, even
tossing roses at some.</TE>
<TE>   Reiner hopped and wiggled off the stage. Jack Shakely, the
California Community Foundation's president, showed why he is
affectionately known as the "silver fox of philanthropy" by tossing
dollar bills to women. Leland Wong, community-relations director for
Kaiser Permanente, gyrated like a Chippendale dancer. Geoffrey Cowan,
dean of the USC Annenberg School for Communication, threw candy. And
Walter Hill Jr., president of Icon Blue Inc., was coaxed by Kuehl
into doing his happy dance, a bump, grind and shimmy routine he
executes whenever he hears good news.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo hammed it up like James Bond in dark shades and cut
such a striking silhouette in a finely tailored suit that Kuehl
commented: "Ladies, look at that body." The openly gay legislator
quickly noted, "And I don't even know what I'm talking about here."</TE>
<TE>   Villaraigosa, dapper in an Armani tuxedo, closed the show, as
Kuehl announced: "Here's a real candidate for 'The Full Monty.'" With
that, a few women tossed back their dollar bills.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe next year, ladies. Maybe, next year.</TE>

<HD>Fox Tries to Boost Mexico's Housing</HD>
<DH>Credit: The president pushes an initiative to lower loan
costs and strengthen the mortgage market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CANCUN, Mexico</DL>
<LD>President Vicente Fox is trying to breathe life into Mexico's
moribund housing industry by creating a viable mortgage market in a
country where home loans are often too expensive or unavailable on
any terms to potential buyers.</LD>
<LD>   Loan scarcity is a big reason why Mexico's housing shortage is
reaching crisis proportions. The country's housing deficit is now at
more than 3 million units and growing at 300,000 per year, said
panelists at the Mexican Bankers Assn. meeting here over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, Fox established the Federal Mortgage Assn., an agency
resembling Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that will seek to ensure a
continuous flow of funds to lenders by repackaging mortgages into
securities that are sold to institutional and other investors.
Operations began this month with the goal of increasing the number
and lowering the cost of home loans.</LD>
<TE>   Speaking to the bankers group, Fox promised a legislative
initiative to free up mortgage funds by giving lenders stronger legal
recourse in collecting loan collateral. Weak collection and eviction
powers are among the reasons why banks and mortgage lenders have
retreated from the market since Mexico's 1995 economic crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's initiative will depend on cooperation from the Mexican
congress, which so far has been unreceptive to Fox's reform efforts
in other areas of the economy, including energy and taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Fox also wants to give managers of individual retirement accounts,
called afores, the right to invest in mortgages, said Manuel Zepeda,
general director of the Federal Mortgage Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Standardization of Mexico's appraisal industry and modernization
of how property and liens are recorded also are to be included in the
Fox plan, Zepeda said. Arbitrary and--by U.S. standards--incomplete
recording practices also have worked to discourage many mortgage
lenders here.</TE>
<TE>   Although the outcome of the Fox initiative may be uncertain,
economists at the bankers' association meeting emphasized that the
weak housing and mortgage markets are taking a toll on Mexican
society and economy.</TE>
<TE>   Glaring evidence of the social costs can be seen in the shanty
towns that ring most Mexican cities. To the east of the Mesa de Otay
manufacturing zone in Tijuana, thousands of maquiladora workers who
can't afford or find more substantial dwellings live in squalid
neighborhoods with no running water, sewers or paved streets.</TE>
<TE>   By any standard, Mexican lending in general and home mortgages
especially are extremely weak when compared with other countries.</TE>
<TE>   Zepeda said total home loans outstanding equal just 5% of Mexico's
annual economic output. That compares with more than 60% in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   The scarcity of housing is limiting Mexico's economic growth on a
macro level and in terms of individual wealth. Mexico doesn't enjoy
the "multiplier effect" that a strong housing industry has for
creating jobs and business formation.</TE>
<TE>   On an individual level, there is less wealth being created because
owners of shacks or substandard housing do not enjoy the home equity
that those who own titled real estate do.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's credit problem is not restricted to mortgages. There is a
shortage of all sorts of consumer and business loans. Overall credit
in Mexico, which includes all kinds of private loans, equals 29% of
the economy, compared with a U.S. loan portfolio that equals 170% of
the U.S. gross national product, said Arturo Fernandez, director of
the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, known by its
initials ITAM.</TE>
<TE>   Studies show that raising Mexico's private loan portfolio from its
present 29% to 70% of total economic output would add two percentage
points to the annual economic growth rate, Fernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   Zepeda of the Federal Mortgage Assn. said mortgage lending--and
the housing industry generally--is poised for an upturn. His new
agency expects to underwrite 70,000 fixed-rate loans this year.</TE>
<TE>   Borrowers who qualify can get loans by putting down only 10%, not
the 40% down payment that has been required of applicants in recent
years. The down payment is being lowered because his agency is
effectively guaranteeing to reimburse lenders for the first 25% of
loan losses.</TE>
<TE>   Interest of foreign home builders and mortgage companies is
rising. General Electric Co.'s GE Capital and Dutch financial giant
ING recently have acquired or started mortgage finance operations in
Mexico. Home builders, including U.S. giant Pulte Homes Inc., have
raised construction targets for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "They feel it is a reality that there will be great growth in
Mexico," Zepeda said.</TE>

<HD>Disney Outlines Plans for 3 Pixar Films</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Details about the movies should soothe
concern about studios' collaboration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co. unveiled plans Sunday for three computer-animated
films in its venture with Pixar Animation Studios Inc., which
together created the 2001 hit "Monsters, Inc.," the second-highest
grossing animated movie with $504 million in global ticket sales.</LD>
<LD>   Pixar, which is based in Emeryville, Calif., and is headed by
Apple Computer Inc. chief Steven Jobs, makes the movies and
Burbank-based Disney markets and distributes them.</LD>
<LD>   The plans should soothe concern on Wall Street over the
partnership, which started with 1995's "Toy Story" and has raked in
$1.7 billion in global ticket sales from three subsequent films--"A
Bug's Life," "Toy Story 2" and November's "Monsters, Inc."</LD>
<TE>   The most recent movie, a family film about a pair of
ghastly-looking but fun-loving monsters who scare humans for a
living, has amassed $253 million in domestic box-office and $251
million in international ticket sales after setting records in Japan,
Britain, Mexico and Spain.</TE>
<TE>   "Monsters" is second in box-office sales to Disney's "The Lion
King," which generated $767 million in worldwide ticket sales after
its release in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   First on the slate of new Disney/Pixar films is "Finding Nemo," an
underwater adventure set for release in the summer of 2003. It is
being written and directed by Andrew Stanton, who was co-director and
co-screenwriter of 1998's "A Bug's Life" and co-screenwriter of the
"Toy Story" films.</TE>
<TE>   The companies plan to release "The Incredibles," an
action-adventure comedy from director Brad Bird ("The Iron Giant")
for the 2004 holiday season. It centers on a family of superheroes
who save the world while living a quiet suburban life.</TE>
<TE>   Scheduled for 2005 is "Cars," directed by Pixar's two-time Academy
Award-winning director John Lasseter. The comedy will feature an
assortment of cars as characters who get their kicks on the famous
Route 66.</TE>
<TE>   In January, confusion arose among some investors over the length
of the companies' venture, prompting Jobs to issue a statement saying
the two would combine for three more movies under their current
working relationship, which is a straightforward 50/50 venture.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's announcement outlines the three movies under the existing
deal, and Disney executives declined to discuss plans beyond the
three. But until Sunday, details on the collaboration were sketchy.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Disney stock closed at $24.95 on the New York Stock
Exchange, up 20% so far this year. In Nasdaq trading, Pixar ended at
$37.37, up 4% this year.</TE>

<HD>Gas Prices Drop Half a Cent Despite Global Tensions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gasoline prices edged down a fraction of a cent over the last two
weeks, despite tensions in oil-producing regions such as the Middle
East and South America.</LD>
<LD>   Friday's weighted price per gallon for all grades and taxes was
about $1.46, down just over half a cent from two weeks earlier,
according to the Lundberg survey of 8,000 gas stations nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   The decrease--the first since Feb. 8--could be a sign that
gasoline prices, which generally spike during the summer months, may
have peaked, analyst Trilby Lundberg said Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   "At the very least, the gasoline price hikes have been stalled,"
Lundberg said. "And this is despite dramatic headlines out of two key
oil-producing countries--Iraq and Venezuela."</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has threatened to cut off oil shipments for a month to
protest the Israeli military action in the West Bank. Venezuela's
president, Hugo Chavez, survived a military coup attempt that lasted
two days.</TE>
<TE>   Despite some brief fluctuation, crude oil prices have remained
steady, Lundberg said.</TE>
<TE>   From Feb. 8 to April 7, gasoline prices jumped 32 cents. Prices
remain more than 21 cents a gallon lower than they were at this time
last year, when gas cost $1.67 per gallon.</TE>
<TE>   The national weighted average price, including taxes, at
self-serve pumps Friday was about $1.42 per gallon for regular, $1.52
for mid-grade and $1.61 for premium.</TE>

<HD>Gates Set to Testify in Microsoft Trial</HD>
<DH>Courts: Some experts say he could help his firm in
antitrust case. Others call it a mistake.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a bold but risky bid to fend off tough antitrust punishment of his
company, Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates today is scheduled to
testify in the landmark case.</LD>
<LD>   The much-anticipated appearance by the world's richest man will be
the first time Gates has testified in court in person during
Microsoft's four-year antitrust battle with the government.</LD>
<LD>   The move, which comes in the sixth week of the trial pitting
Microsoft against nine states, is aimed at projecting a more
compliant image of the software giant to a federal judge who will
decide what punishment Microsoft should face for violating antitrust
laws.</LD>
<TE>   Gates "will address the evolution of the PC industry and ... speak
to the potential harm to consumers and the industry posed" by the
states' remedy proposals, Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said. "No
one is better at talking about these issues than Bill Gates."</TE>
<TE>   Gates' appearance also may help counter the damaging effect of his
1998 videotaped deposition in which he appeared aloof, forgetful and
defensive.</TE>
<TE>   In that video, Gates repeatedly said he could not recall key
corporate events. But government lawyers contradicted his statements
at the time by introducing incriminating e-mails and other documents
that showed Gates had direct knowledge of many of the firm's efforts
to crush business rivals.</TE>
<TE>   The video appeared to have a significant effect on the original
trial judge in the antitrust case, who repeatedly urged Microsoft to
put Gates on the stand and then--in an interview published after he
ruled against the company--likened Gates to Napoleon.</TE>
<TE>   A federal appeals court, saying the comments by U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson showed bias, reversed the jurist's
order to break up Microsoft. But the appeals panel upheld Jackson's
ruling that Microsoft violated antitrust laws by using its flagship
Windows software to thwart competition from software rival Netscape
Communications Corp., which was later acquired by America Online Inc.
The appeals court directed the district court to replace Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the appointment of U.S. District Judge Colleen
Kollar-Kotelly to the case last fall, the company announced that
Gates would testify. But few experts believed the brilliant but
volatile software mogul would take the stand because of the risk that
he might tip the balance against the company in a closely fought
antitrust case.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers present when Gates was deposed in February for the current
trial proceedings said he did much better than in the first
deposition. The deposition from February has not been released. But
the performance apparently gave Microsoft confidence that Gates might
be an asset on the witness stand.</TE>
<TE>   "He was animated and much more easygoing than the first time
around; he even cracked a few jokes," said one lawyer who was
present.</TE>
<TE>   Gates' levity may dissipate in what experts expect to be a tense
showdown between Gates and the states' lead trial lawyer, Brendan V.
Sullivan Jr.--one of Washington's best-known litigators.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan, who hasn't cross-examined any Microsoft witnesses or
spoken at length in court since his opening statement March 18, could
confront Gates with portions of his earlier video deposition or use
incriminating e-mails to discredit the software executive. Legal
experts say Sullivan will be limited in his cross-examination by the
scope of Gates' direct testimony.</TE>
<TE>   If Gates' direct testimony concerns only the general development
of the PC industry as Microsoft has indicated, Sullivan may have a
tough time capitalizing on the company chairman's courtroom
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say that since Microsoft reached an out-of-court
settlement with the Justice Department in November and avoided a
court-ordered breakup, Gates may have more to gain--and the states
more to lose--by speaking out on behalf of his company.</TE>
<TE>   "The upside for Microsoft, it seems to me, is greater than the
downside," said Andrew Gavil, an antitrust expert and law professor
at Howard University.</TE>
<TE>   Gates, Gavil added, has "been the shadow defendant in the case all
along. And if anyone is going to make the case for Microsoft that the
states' remedies are harsh and unnecessary, it is Mr. Gates."</TE>
<TE>   Some longtime observers of Microsoft, however, said Gates'
volatile personality still makes it risky to put him on the witness
stand.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Gates has a tendency to think he can outsmart people," said
Rob Enderle, a senior technology analyst for Giga Information Group
Inc. in Santa Clara. "He's a smart guy. But [cross-examination] is
what these lawyers do for a living. I think his appearance is
ill-advised. If he wants to [burnish] the image of Microsoft ... the
place to do it is not in the courtroom."</TE>

<HD>U.S., Japan Sign Accord to Boost Travel Industries</HD>
<DH>Tourism: Joint panel will work to regain the drop-off since
Sept. 11. L.A., other top destinations will take part in promotions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS and MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Concerned about the severe drop-off in travel since the September
terrorist attacks, the United States and Japan have signed a pact to
promote tourism between the two nations and give a boost to their
respective travel industries.</LD>
<LD>   The bilateral agreement, signed Friday in Tokyo by U.S. Commerce
Secretary Don Evans and his Japanese counterpart, Transport Minister
Chikage Ogi, primarily calls for creating something called a tourism
expansion council that will consider how to increase the number of
tourists by 20% over the next five years.</LD>
<LD>   Japanese tourists to the U.S. spend about $10 billion a year, more
than one-tenth of which is spent in California. But travel from Japan
dropped more than 50% immediately after the attacks and remains at
about 60% of pre-Sept. 11 levels, according to the Commerce
Department. Likewise, travel to Japan from the U.S. dropped nearly in
half and has not rebounded significantly, according to the Japan
Travel Bureau.</LD>
<TE>   "We have to be aggressive when it comes to Japan," said Trevor
Francis, a Commerce Department spokesman. Japanese tourists "account
for around $10 billion in visitor spending here, more than any other
market, and they're continuing to rebound more slowly than any other
market."</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese have been by far the biggest tourist group to
California, where more than 1 million visitors spent $1.2 billion
statewide in 2000. Last year, that number dropped to 692,000
visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is the top mainland destination for Japanese visitors,
who spent nearly $500 million here last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, [the agreement] is driven by the significant decline
in tourism seen on both sides of the Pacific," said George Kirkland,
president of the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau and
co-chair of the initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkland, who traveled to Tokyo for the pact's signing, said the
20% growth target over the next five years may not sound like a lot,
but it is relatively ambitious compared with the Commerce
Department's projection of about 3% growth during the same period.</TE>
<TE>   The 4% annual target is a national average, he added, which means
gateway destinations such as Los Angeles and Honolulu probably will
fare better.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the tourism industry has seen a lot of feel-good
initiatives that didn't accomplish much.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing anyone needs in the travel industry is another
expression of goodwill," Kirkland said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. promotion in Japan has been marked by a series of narrow
efforts by individual states and cities.</TE>
<TE>   What officials hope this agreement will offer, Kirkland said, is a
chance to mount a national marketing campaign to encourage Japanese
to travel to the U.S. at a time when other countries also may be
trying to pick up market share.</TE>
<TE>   Branding and promotion take money, he acknowledged, and it
remained unclear how much will be put into the campaign, or how much
additional money individual states and cities will want to pony up
for a more broad-based initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, you can't win this battle with public relations
alone," he said. The plan calls for joint initiatives in marketing
and advertising, security and safety, among other areas.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco, Las Vegas, New York, Washington and Honolulu also
plan to participate in the initiatives, as will representatives from
the airline, hotel and other travel-related industries, Commerce
Department officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles, meanwhile, has come through the last seven months
better than other travel destinations.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, the Los Angeles visitors bureau had projected an 18%
decline, compared with a 20% drop for the U.S. as a whole. But L.A.
has had a 16% drop-off in tourists since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Based on numbers gathered this year, the bureau's researchers said
they are "guardedly optimistic" that Japanese visitors to Los Angeles
will increase about 6% over 2001--to about 604,000 tourists.</TE>
<TE>   That translates to $522 million in visitor spending, said
researcher David Sheatsley.</TE>
<TE>   "We do believe L.A. will recover faster than the U.S.," he said.
"But we lost something like $108 million in visitor spending from
Japan last year, and you just can't take that lightly."</TE>
<TE>   Because the Japanese government is supporting the bilateral
tourism promotion, officials are hopeful it holds a better chance of
encouraging risk-averse travelers to return to the U.S. After Sept.
11, many Japanese-based businesses imposed an embargo on overseas
travel that was lifted in February.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope it will send a strong message to Japanese tourists, who
tend to be more sensitive than other markets when it comes to
traveling and safety concerns," said Patti MacJennett, international
marketing director for the L.A. visitors bureau. "With their
government urging them to travel again, it's a more credible message.
At this point, it may very well mean more to them than anything
else."</TE>

<HD>State Housing Crisis Looms</HD>
<DH>Economy: California isn't building enough and is looking
less attractive to workers and businesses, study says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A shortage of housing and soaring home prices are fast emerging as
liabilities for California, according to a report to be released
today that looks at the state's long-term economic prospects.</LD>
<LD>   Although parts of the Bay Area and Southern California's coastal
counties have long been synonymous with sizzling real estate prices,
even homes in so-called affordable regions such as the Inland Empire
and Sacramento are looking pricey relative to areas such as Phoenix,
Salt Lake City, Las Vegas and Portland, Ore. That could spell trouble
if California doesn't respond quickly by building more housing to
keep workers and businesses in the Golden State, said economist
Stephen Levy, director of the Palo Alto-based Center for the
Continuing Study of the California Economy.</LD>
<LD>   "Housing prices are setting records in the middle of a recession,
which should raise a red flag about how serious California's housing
shortage will be once job growth resumes," Levy said. "It's a major
economic challenge, and a serious problem for companies looking to
expand and attract workers."</LD>
<TE>   Although job growth and income gains in California have stalled
during the last year, Levy's report depicts an economy that's merely
pausing before the next big growth spurt.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the early '90s, when California's defense industry slid
into a decline, the state's new economic drivers--high technology,
foreign trade, professional services, entertainment and tourism--have
experienced only temporary setbacks during this slowdown, Levy said.
He expects California to post solid job growth and add an average of
about 600,000 residents annually in coming years.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble is that California isn't building enough new housing
to keep pace. In 2001, building permits were issued for about 143,000
housing units, with activity down by about 7% through the first two
months of 2002, according to the National Assn. of Home Builders.
Levy estimates that at least 200,000 new units will need to be built
annually to accommodate the state's burgeoning population.</TE>
<TE>   California real estate prices have outpaced the rest of the nation
for decades, Levy said, but the disparity has reached an alarming
level.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, California's median home price was about 50% higher than
the national figure. Last year, California's median hit $263,700--81%
above the national median, according to Levy's data. He said the only
other period when the comparison exceeded 80% was during the time of
the real estate bubble and subsequent bust of the late 1980s and
early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   But in contrast to that period, when real estate speculation and
overbuilding led to a price collapse, Levy said an imbalance between
supply and demand is creating the upward price pressure now.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't speculation, this is unmet demand," Levy said. "And
it's not going away any time soon."</TE>
<TE>   The upshot is that even so-called affordable markets in California
are looking less attractive compared with those of economic rivals.
In the third quarter of 1997, for example, Sacramento posted a median
home price of $116,100 and the Inland Empire $114,300, compared with
$152,000 in Portland, Ore. and $128,600 in Salt Lake City, according
to the report. In the same period last year, Sacramento's $177,000
median had overtaken Portland's at $174,900, while the Inland
Empire's median of $159,700 outstripped Salt Lake City's at $153,000.</TE>
<TE>   Given high land costs, environmental red tape and burgeoning
slow-growth sentiment in many parts of the state, Levy said solutions
won't come easily. He said policymakers first must consider how to
make housing pay.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 13, the 1978 ballot measure that capped property
taxes, cut sharply into the pool of funds cities could use to pay for
services. That has led many communities to favor sales-tax generators
such as big-box retailers and car dealerships over housing and
people, which use services and require costly infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   Levy said legislators might want to consider giving municipalities
a bigger cut of property-tax revenue or some other financial
incentives to encourage home building. He said communities likewise
will need to come up with new models for high-density housing.</TE>
<TE>   A longtime advocate of investing in infrastructure for
California's future, Levy said the state faces several challenges in
the coming years, from its jammed airports and packed roads to
overcrowded schools and dwindling water resources. But he said the
looming housing crisis concerns him most in the short term.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to get cracking on this," Levy said. "We're really far
behind."</TE>

<HD>U-2 Goes Higher-Tech</HD>
<DH>Updated version has latest in avionics to improve flight,
photos.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly five decades after the first U-2 spy plane took flight, an
updated version with the latest equipment sped down the runway in
Palmdale recently to begin another century as America's eye in the
sky.</LD>
<LD>   But before it could take flight, it needed a little help from a
piece of relatively unsophisticated equipment: a Chevrolet Camaro.
Another pilot in a chase car--a Camaro in this case, a Ford Mustang
in others--followed the lumbering plane and radioed directions, a
routine followed in every U-2 takeoff and landing to help deal with
poor visibility from the cockpit.</LD>
<LD>   It was a humbling scene considering an unmanned reconnaissance
plane that could take off, fly and land by itself was just a few
hundred yards away, waiting to take its first flight and looking to
eventually replace the venerable U-2.</LD>
<TE>   For now though, or for at least 20 more years as its supporters
hope, the U-2, a vestige of the Cold War, will keep its title as the
mainstay of the nation's airborne intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1992, the Air Force has spent $1.4 billion upgrading a fleet
of U-2s, whose lineage dates back to the 1940s, so they can fly
higher and faster and take better pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed Martin Corp.'s legendary Skunk Works facility in Palmdale
developed the aircraft, and about 650 people still work on the
program there. Raytheon Co.'s engineers in El Segundo have been
developing more powerful sensors and radars for the U-2.</TE>
<TE>   "This ain't your father's Oldsmobile," said Maj. Gen. Robert
Behler, commander of the Air Force's center for command, control,
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. "These upgrades have
really made the U-2 a 21st century aircraft."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the popular notion that the U.S. still is flying U-2s
built in the 1950s, all 31 U-2s in operation were built in the 1980s
in Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   Though the design is similar, they have a 40% larger fuselage than
their predecessor, which gained worldwide attention in 1960 when a
U-2 piloted by Francis Gary Powers was shot down over the Soviet
Union, escalating Cold War tensions.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters like to point out that despite the advent of unmanned
aircraft such as Northrop Grumman Corp.'s Global Hawk, the U-2 still
is the world's highest-flying aircraft, capable of climbing past
70,000 feet and taking images in which an apple can be distinguished
from an orange.</TE>
<TE>   Aircraft Equipped With the Latest in Avionics</TE>
<TE>   That's because the U-2S, the latest version of the spy plane, has
been fitted with the world's most advanced sensors, radar and
more-powerful jet engines. It also has been coated with new
radar-evading materials. Two weeks ago, the first U-2S with a
glass-panel cockpit display similar to ones found on new Boeing 757s
were delivered to the Air Force.</TE>
<TE>   The new digital glass panels, which cost about $3.5 million, or
more than three times what the original planes cost to develop and
build, replace the 1960s analog gauges and give pilots significantly
more situational awareness.</TE>
<TE>   One major advantage of the new panel is that U-2 pilots will have
a much better view of the ground, using one of three electronic
displays.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, they had to peer into a large tube in the center of
the cockpit panel that acted like an inverted periscope, which gave
them their only view of the ground.</TE>
<TE>   With all the enhancements, the U-2 continues to provide invaluable
airborne intelligence, Air Force officials said. Although robotic spy
planes such as the Predator and Global Hawk have gained much of the
attention in Afghanistan, the U-2 has been the real workhorse, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, in a Pentagon briefing about lessons learned from the
military operations in Afghanistan, an Air Force official said the
U-2 has been flying every day over the country and has been providing
most of the intelligence used in Operation Enduring Freedom. The
aircraft has flown more than 265 missions, each lasting an average of
10 hours.</TE>
<TE>   And for the first time, the U-2s were used along with an unmanned
spy plane to cross-check potential targets to ensure they were the
correct ones, providing what one official called an "amazing
capability" that the military had never had before.</TE>
<TE>   "The U-2 is playing an incredible role in Afghanistan," Behler
said. "There is a lot of life left in this aircraft."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the Air Force has been testing a new communications
system on the U-2s even as they were flying military operations over
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The new satellite-based system, a pod attached to the top of the
aircraft, allowed pilots to transmit images and data instantly to a
ground facility in California. From there, the information was
analyzed and then retransmitted to the Air Force command center in
Saudi Arabia, all within minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, the pilot had to return to base after a mission that
could take as long as 10 hours before collected information could be
processed.</TE>
<TE>   Handling U-2 in Flight Remains Difficult Task</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the upgrades and improvements, the U-2 still is
notoriously difficult to fly. Pilots must wear full-pressure suits
similar to those worn by astronauts. They are so cumbersome that two
people must help the pilot get into them.</TE>
<TE>   Once in the suit, the pilot must breathe pure oxygen one hour
before a flight to eliminate nitrogen from the bloodstream. Flying at
such altitude, nitrogen bubbles can build up in the tissues, causing
the bends, which can lead to paralysis or death.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the suit, pilots have very little room to move their
heads, so they must rely on a "mobile," a person in a chase car, to
help them take off and land. Although taking off is a difficult task,
landing the aircraft is even tougher. The Air Force said the U-2 is
the hardest plane in its aircraft inventory to touch down.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, when the aircraft is 10 feet above the runway, a
mobile in the chase car, which is speeding along the runway behind
the plane, talks the pilot down to 2 feet. At that point, the pilot
powers down the engines and aerodynamically stalls the aircraft to
land.</TE>
<TE>   The unusual procedure for landing the U-2 was just one of many
common-sense approaches that made Kelly Johnson, the U-2's designer,
known as one of the foremost aircraft designers in history.</TE>
<TE>   In the early days, engineers tried to jury-rig radar-evading
capabilities to the U-2. A secret project known as Trapeze involved
attaching long bamboo poles to both wings parallel to the fuselage.
On each pole beaded wires were attached, like streamers, to help
"trap" radar pulses.</TE>
<TE>   In an elaborate ceremony at the Skunk Works facility this month,
the U-2S with the new cockpit displays was unveiled.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed proclaimed that nothing currently flying or that will be
operational in the next 15 years will come close to the capabilities
of the new U-2.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a new chapter in the life of the new U-2," said Frank
Mauro, Lockheed's U-2 program manager. "It's got enough structural
life left in it to fly for another 50 years."</TE>

<LD>GDP Expected to Show 4.8% Growth Rate</LD>
<LD>   The government's advanced tally of gross domestic product, the
broadest measure of the economy's health, will be closely watched
when it's released Friday. The report is expected to show GDP
expanded at a 4.8% rate in the first quarter, up significantly from
the fourth quarter's 1.7% growth rate.</LD>
<LD>   The market will scrutinize that number to see how much of it is
attributable to inventory rebuilding and how much to final demand.
Federal Reserve policymakers look for sustainable final demand for
evidence a solid economic recovery is taking hold.</LD>
<TE>   The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey for April
also is due Friday. In March, the index rose to its highest level
since December 2000, suggesting continued robust consumer spending,
which represents about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.</TE>
<TE>   The March durable goods orders report, due Wednesday, is expected
to show that orders slipped in March after rising 1.8% in February,
according to a Reuters poll.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the government is expected to report a 0.9% increase
in the first-quarter employment cost index.</TE>

<TE>   Many Dow Components to Announce Earnings</TE>
<TE>   More than 160, or about one-third, of the companies in the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 are slated to release quarterly results this
week, marking the peak of the first-quarter reporting period. Many of
the 30 blue-chip Dow components are on that lengthy list, from
diversified manufacturer 3M Co. to telecom heavyweight AT&amp;T Corp.</TE>
<TE>   But with a growing focus on transparent accounting and uncertainty
over the strength of an economic rebound, corporate America will be
tight-lipped about upcoming quarters.</TE>
<TE>   About 220 companies, or 44%, of the S&amp;P 500 have reported earnings
so far this season, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Among
those, 131 companies, or 60%, topped analysts' estimates, and 30, or
14%, missed Wall Street's targets.</TE>
<TE>   First-quarter earnings are beating analysts' estimates by an
average of 3%, better than the 1% average recorded since the
mid-1980s and the 2% average since 1990, according to Thomson
Financial. But analysts warn that impressive performance is largely
because of analysts' significantly lowered forecasts.</TE>

<TE>   Milken Institute Hosts Global Conference</TE>
<TE>   About 1,500 people will attend the Milken Institute's 2002 Global
Conference at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, beginning today.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth annual event, whose theme is "Building Prosperity in an
Interdependent World," will bring together economists, academics,
executives, financiers and others to discuss public policy, social
issues and economic trends.</TE>
<TE>   This year's speaker lineup includes Jared Diamond, Pulitzer

<HD>For Now, It's Business as Usual for SAG Members and Agents</HD>
<DH>Labor: Neither side plans dramatic moves after rejection of
proposed pact governing relations between the two.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood actors and agents settled into an uneasy standoff Sunday
that may continue for months after this weekend's unraveling of a
proposed new agreement governing relations between the two.</LD>
<LD>   It was clear that neither side for now plans any dramatic moves,
despite mounting tensions over the rejection by SAG members Friday of
an agreement that would have allowed Hollywood talent agencies to
seek investments from advertising companies and producers. In voting
down the deal, SAG members overruled their board of directors.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, SAG advised its members to continue working with their
agents even as it acknowledged that talent agencies are no longer
bound, as they have been since 1939, by SAG rules governing
commissions and other matters, which now have expired.</LD>
<TE>   For their part, agents said they would continue to represent
clients as they always have, adding that they have no plans now to
take advantage of the situation by raising commissions or selling
pieces of their businesses.</TE>
<TE>   In theory, agents could argue they now are free to do what they
want, such as selling parts of their businesses to advertising
companies or charging commissions on video or DVD deals, things that
were previously prohibited. But they privately acknowledged those
scenarios are unlikely because major stars they represent might frown
on such moves.</TE>
<TE>   One top talent agency official also said that potential suitors or
investors would be wary of discussing specific deals until issues
between SAG and agents are resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1939, SAG has required agents who want to represent actors
to sign a franchise agreement aimed at protecting actors from
unscrupulous agents. Agents for years have said the rules are too
restrictive, preventing them from attracting capital to expand their
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the proposed deal successfully shot it down by
arguing that loosening the rules would create conflicts of interest.
They said a talent agency, for example, could represent a client in
negotiations to film a soft drink commercial made by an advertising
agency that is one of its owners.</TE>
<TE>   SAG said Sunday that it will seek to persuade agents to re-sign
the expired agreement, although agents privately said they aren't
interested.</TE>
<TE>   If agents hold firm, it could set the stage for a showdown should
SAG insist its members use only agents who have re-signed its
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   That could force stars to choose between the union and the major
talent agencies that represent them, such as Creative Artists Agency,
International Creative Management, William Morris Agency, United
Talent Agency and Endeavor.</TE>
<TE>   Whether SAG would go that far remains unclear, especially because
the union itself has been bitterly divided over the issue. Making
things murkier was a recent decision by SAG's sister union, the
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, to strongly
endorse the same deal SAG members rejected.</TE>
<TE>   The fight between SAG agents comes at a delicate time for the
fractious union. As part of the rejected agreement with agents, major
talent agencies had agreed to help SAG fight runaway film and TV
production to foreign countries, which would give the union powerful
allies.</TE>
<TE>   Although agents said they have no plans to undercut SAG's efforts,
some said they believe that enthusiasm has waned for supporting the
union's efforts.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Attorney General Aims to Revamp Brokers' Practices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The New York state attorney general's office traditionally has
targeted low-level securities fraud, when it has focused on Wall
Street at all.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer is swinging for the fences.</LD>
<LD>   Armed with private e-mails in which Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analysts
disparaged some Internet stocks as "crap" while publicly recommending
them to customers in 2000 and 2001, Spitzer earlier this month took
the brokerage giant to court, demanding reforms.</LD>
<TE>   The attorney general says he wants to do much more than just
embarrass Wall Street: His aim is a fundamental overhaul of how the
industry does business.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Merrill last week agreed to new disclosure policies
that will warn the firm's investors about the potential conflicts of
interest between its stock analysts and its investment banking
department.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's 10-month probe of Merrill's research practices found
that its Internet analysts routinely felt pressured to tout stocks to
aid the firm's bankers in seeking fee-rich underwriting business from
the subject companies.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer now is negotiating a "blueprint settlement" with Merrill
that he hopes will be a model for new federal securities laws
addressing brokerage practices industrywide. Meanwhile, his office
has expanded the investigation to other major Wall Street firms,
subpoenaing e-mails and other documents.</TE>
<TE>   But if the probe has made the 42-year-old first-time attorney
general a hero to many small investors burned by the plunge in
technology stocks since 2000, it also has stirred a debate over both
his motives and his goals.</TE>
<TE>   The cynical view is that, like former New York City Mayor Rudolph
W. Giuliani, who won fame prosecuting insider trading as a U.S.
attorney in the 1980s, Spitzer hopes to make political hay by tapping
the public resentment of Wall Street in the wake of the dot-com
collapse and the Enron Corp. scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer, a Democrat who won office in 1998 by a tiny margin, is up
for reelection this year and is regarded as a potential future
candidate for governor.</TE>
<TE>   But those who admire Spitzer say that pushing for sweeping reform
has been a hallmark of his career, whether his adversaries were
electric utilities, handgun manufacturers or organized crime.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers say Spitzer's decision to battle the big brokerages
is politically risky in New York, given the industry's struggle to
recover from Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Taking on Wall Street is not going to get him elected to
anything, it's just going to make it harder for him to raise money,"
said Michael Cherkasky, the court-appointed monitor of the Los
Angeles Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   When Cherkasky was an assistant New York district attorney, he
recruited Spitzer for the labor racketeering unit, where Spitzer's
biggest case was the 1992 prosecution of Thomas and Joseph Gambino,
sons of the late mob boss Carlo Gambino.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers, who allegedly ran a trucking cartel that had a
stranglehold on New York's garment industry, pleaded guilty to one
civil count of restraint of trade, paid a $12-million fine and agreed
to bow out of the garment center trucking business.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer showed "extraordinary creativity" in the case, setting up
a sting operation in which investigators opened a small dressmaking
company, Cherkasky said.</TE>
<TE>   "We were the only garment factory in New York that paid a fair
wage and [health] benefits, which is why we lost so much money,"
Spitzer joked in an interview last week.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very bright and resourceful prosecutor," Michael Rosen,
the New York lawyer who defended Thomas Gambino, said of Spitzer.</TE>
<TE>   In Rosen's view, the case was a loss for Spitzer because he failed
to convict the brothers of criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   But he gave Spitzer credit for settling the case in the middle of
the trial and "salvaging what he deemed most important"--the
Gambinos' exit from garment center trucking.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't just ego with him," Rosen said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps incongruous for a Manhattanite with degrees from Princeton
and Harvard Law School, Spitzer is a NASCAR stock-racing fan. He came
by this interest through his brother-in-law, chief engineer for star
driver Jeff Gordon.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer and his wife, Silda, also a Harvard Law graduate, have
three daughters and live on Manhattan's Upper East Side.</TE>
<TE>   After a clerkship with a federal judge and six years as an
assistant district attorney, Spitzer first ran for attorney general
in 1994. He finished dead last in a four-way Democratic primary,
despite spending more than $4 million of his own and his family's
money.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's 1998 campaign, again largely self-financed, was one of
the nastiest on record, with Spitzer accusing incumbent Republican
Dennis Vacco of patronage and racial insensitivity and Vacco firing
back with accusations that Spitzer illegally accepted too much money
from his father, Bernard, a wealthy New York landlord.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer denied breaking any laws, but late in the race he was
forced to admit something he had earlier denied--that his father had
lent him $3.8 million to cover debt from the 1994 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Since taking office, Spitzer has tried to use the platform of a
regional prosecutor to address national, if not global, issues.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in litigation that still is pending, he sued a group
of Midwestern utilities on the grounds that emissions from their
plants were responsible for acid rain and respiratory problems in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Though he often makes headlines, Spitzer doesn't always achieve
results. He unsuccessfully tried to use a state public nuisance
statute to impose sweeping design and distribution changes on the
handgun industry.</TE>
<TE>   In the arena of securities regulation, however, New York laws may
give Spitzer a stronger hand, according to Columbia University law
professor John C. Coffee.</TE>
<TE>   New York's securities code, the Martin Act, provides both criminal
and civil fraud penalties, and it gives a prosecutor the power to
hold "quasi-inquisitional hearings" in front of a state supreme court
justice and in public, Coffee said.</TE>
<TE>   For a prosecutor bent on "ceremonial humiliation," it would be the
perfect tool, Coffee said.</TE>
<TE>   For the securities industry, Spitzer's probe must be particularly
frightening because it seems to come out of left field, Coffee added.</TE>
<TE>   "Wall Street is used to the attorney general being more of a
patron," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Stock market regulation, of course, is the main turf of the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Spitzer's explosive allegations
have been awkward for the federal agency, which sometimes has been
criticized for a lack of aggressiveness in policing Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer sounded a conciliatory note last week.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to criticize the SEC," he said. "I'm not of the view
that the New York attorney general's office [by itself] is in a
position to remake the securities world. We will be cooperating with
them."</TE>

<KH>EXECUTIVE ROUNDTABLE</KH>
<HD>A Confrontation Is Just a Talk That Searches for the Truth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Executive Roundtable is a weekly column by TEC Worldwide, an
international organization of more than 7,000 business owners,
company presidents and chief executives. TEC members meet in small
peer groups to share their business experiences and help one another
solve problems in a round-table session. The following question and
answer are a summary of a discussion at a recent TEC meeting in
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Question: I need to have a serious talk with my sales manager
about the way he treats his people. He gets the job done in terms of
the numbers, but his management style is so abrasive that we keep
losing good salespeople. I've mentioned to him several times that he
needs to lighten up, but it seems to go in one ear and out the other.
My problem is that I'm not good at confrontation.</LD>
<LD>   Consequently, I keep putting off the conversation I know I need to
have. It's gotten to the point where it's keeping me awake at night
and affecting my performance on the job. How can I get over my fear
of confrontation?</LD>
<TE>   Answer: It sounds like you have developed a severe case of
"confrontophobia"--the inability to sit down with someone and hold
that person accountable for what he or she is supposed to do.</TE>
<TE>   Don't feel alone. Confrontation ranks high on the list of
activities feared and loathed by executives at all levels, according
to Susan Scott, a Seattle-based management consultant and author of
the forthcoming book "Fierce Conversations." Where does this fear
come from? Mainly from outdated and misguided notions about the true
nature of confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   Most people see confrontation as a distasteful activity that
involves head-to-head conflict with another person. In reality, Scott
says, confrontation involves nothing more than a mutual search for
the truth. It's how you go about searching for the truth, however,
that makes the difference in your ability to resolve the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "Confrontation does not consist of arguing, blaming, accusing,
yelling, finger pointing or any of the combative behaviors that most
people attribute to it," she explains. "Instead, the process of
confrontation involves two or more people getting on the same side of
the table and investigating an issue together. The secret to
successful confrontation is to first own your piece of the truth and
then open yourself up to other truths."</TE>
<TE>   To prepare for a confrontational conversation with someone, Scott
recommends, first determine what you want, why you want it and whom
you want it from. Then clarify in your own mind the particulars of
the situation--what has happened, how you feel about it and what's at
stake.</TE>
<TE>   Next, examine your contribution to the problem. What have you
brought to the table that might be contributing to or exacerbating
the problem? Equally important, examine your feelings about the issue
and the confrontation. How long have your feelings been building up?
How long have you been postponing the conversation? How have your
feelings been undermining your relationship with this person?</TE>
<TE>   Finally, prepare what you need to say. Write an opening statement
and read it aloud several times. Listen carefully to the words coming
out of your mouth and consider how someone else might hear them. Keep
working on your statement until you get it exactly right.</TE>
<TE>   During the confrontation, present your opening statement and
define reality the way you see it. Always state the issue in the
first person--"This is what I saw happen, this is how I feel about
it, this is what's at stake for me, and this is what I want to
resolve in this conversation."</TE>
<TE>   Next, ask the other person to give his or her version of reality.
Listen carefully without rushing to judgment. Instead, ask probing
questions to gain clarity on the person's position. Make sure the
person knows that you fully understand and acknowledge his or her
position and interests. No matter what the other person says, do not
try to build your case. That only puts the person on the defensive
and sends the message that you have a closed mind. Instead, ask as
many open-ended questions as possible to get the person talking about
his or her side of the story.</TE>
<TE>   Once each of you understands the other's position, identify what
you learned during the conversation and chart a course for action.
Ask questions such as: "Where are we now on this issue? What was left
unsaid that needs saying? What is our new understanding? Given this
new understanding, how do we proceed from here? What do we need to do
to achieve resolution?"</TE>
<TE>   Once you reach agreement on a resolution, identify a method for

<LD>Microsoft Corp. lost as much as $200 million from the sale of pirated
software by counterfeiters arrested last week, FBI Director Robert
Mueller said.</LD>
<LD>   The arrests of 27 people in Northern California reflect a change
in the business of software piracy.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and database billionaire Larry Ellison have
been named this year's most notorious American violators of personal
privacy by leading advocacy groups.</LD>
<LD>   The annual Big Brother Awards are presented to government,
corporations and private individuals who allegedly have done the most
to threaten personal privacy.</LD>
<LD>   Privacy International, a London-based coalition of privacy experts
and human rights groups, presented the awards at the annual
Computers, Freedom &amp; Privacy conference in San Francisco last week.</LD>
<TE>   The Worst Government Official award went to Ashcroft. Privacy
International said the top U.S. law enforcement officer is
responsible for a massive increase in wiretapping of phones and other
electronics and for the imprisonment without charge of thousands of
people in the United States in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Worst Corporate Invader honor went to Ellison of Oracle Corp.,
the world's leading maker of database software, for his advocacy of a
centralized, Oracle-run government database that could be used as a
national identification system.</TE>

<LD>Nevada's gaming regulators were warned about numerous high-tech
hazards in trying to monitor Internet gambling activity if it is

<LD>   Marc McDermott, chief of the electronics division for the state's
Gaming Control Board, said last week that there are so many ways to
make online bets that saying such bets are secure is "just a guess to
make people happy for the most part."</LD>

state to legalize Internet gambling, provided there's no conflict

<LD>Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) proposed a measure last week that
would increase consumer privacy on the Internet, reviving a once-hot
issue that has taken a back seat to security concerns since the Sept.
11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Hollings hopes to require online businesses to get customer
permission before disclosing sensitive information such as bank
account details or sexual orientation. Less sensitive data, such as
purchase or browsing records, could be shared with third parties
unless the customer specifically said otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation promises to revive a debate about how businesses
use customer e-mail addresses, phone numbers, purchase records and
other data collected through their Web sites.</LD>

<HD>Put to the Test, Google's Still a Better Engine</HD>
<DH>Internet: In an informal survey, one reporter finds that
the top search portal answers the tough questions best.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL LIEDTKE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the rarefied world of online search, Google remains the engine of
choice.</LD>
<LD>   At least that's what we found in an unscientific test that pit
Google's powers against the tools of Teoma, an upstart claiming that
it has developed a better way to explore unfamiliar turf on the Web.</LD>
<LD>   Seven widely divergent questions were posed to Google, Teoma and
two other highly touted search engines, Alltheweb and Wisenut, as
well as AltaVista, a pioneer that lost its way a few years ago during
the dot-com boom.</LD>
<TE>   In all cases, I used the most elementary of search techniques,
entering the same keywords from each question into each engine.</TE>
<TE>   Though all the engines fared reasonably well on most questions,
none approached Google's processing speed or ability to provide
relevant links to the answers. What's more, Google was the only
engine to guide us in each case to the requested information on its
first page of results.</TE>
<TE>   These two questions stymied all the other engines:</TE>
<TE>   "What Pulitzer Prizes did the New Orleans Times-Picayune win and
in what year?" and "What is the name of the song featured in the
Mitsubishi commercials with the lyrics 'I wish that I knew what I
know now, when I was younger'?"</TE>
<TE>   It took 0.24 second for Google to provide me with a link to a page
on the Times-Picayune's Web site, where I learned the New Orleans
paper won two Pulitzers, both in 1997--one for public service and
another for editorial cartooning.</TE>
<TE>   Google took even less time--0.19 second by its own clock--to
answer the question about the Mitsubishi song, even though I
initially misspelled Mitsubishi.</TE>
<TE>   In a nice demonstration of Google's intuitive powers, the search
engine still figured out what I really meant and provided a link to
an online discussion board, where I learned that the Mitsubishi ad
used a 1973 song called "Ooh La La," written by Ron Wood and Ronnie
Lane and sung by Rod Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   Google's performance seemed even more impressive after seeing how
the question about the Times-Picayune fooled the other engines.</TE>
<TE>   Both Teoma and AltaVista provided a high ranking to an MSN Money
page that informed me its managing editor used to work at the New
Orleans paper and several of its staffers had won Pulitzer Prizes
during the 1980s and 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Alltheweb pointed me to a Web page featuring a schedule for last
month's Tennessee Williams/New Orleans Library Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Google's database, the largest of those tested, appears to give it
a major advantage over its rivals. The Mountain View, Calif.-based
company says it draws on an index of 3 billion documents.</TE>
<TE>   Teoma's owner, Ask Jeeves Inc., insists Google's index is littered
with junk links. Teoma believes it does a better job of filtering
useless links, one of the reasons its index consists of just 200
million pages. Teoma says it will be expanding its database.</TE>
<TE>   This is not to suggest the other engines are clueless. They all
provide useful road maps for getting around online.</TE>
<TE>   Teoma looks especially promising as it continues to develop a
format it unveiled along with souped-up search tools this month. An
easy-to-use "refine" button helps focus search requests.</TE>
<TE>   Teoma's resources category also is a handy way to find more
experts on topics. Despite the intrigue of Teoma's extra bells and
whistles, Google remains my first stop for online directions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   The Search for Some Answers</TE>
<TE>   Here's a sampling of the questions the Associated Press asked to
see how online search engine Google stacks up against its
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   THE QUESTIONS:</TE>
<TE>   1. Canada has had only one female prime minister. Who is she?</TE>
<TE>   2. Which were the most frequently banned books of 2001?</TE>
<TE>   3. What is a "roofie" and why is it known as the "date rape drug"?</TE>
<TE>   4. What is hypospadias?</TE>
<TE>   5. Which Pulitzer Prizes did the New Orleans Times-Picayune win,
and in what year?</TE>
<TE>   THE ANSWERS:</TE>
<TE>   1. Kim Campbell, sworn in as Canada's prime minister in June 1993.
She was out of office before the year was over.</TE>
<TE>   2. According to the American Library Assn., the three most
challenged books of 2001 were the "Harry Potter" series by J.K.
Rowling, "Of Mice and Men" by John Steinbeck and Robert Cormier's
"The Chocolate War."</TE>
<TE>   3. "Roofie" stands for Rohypnol, a pill that leaves people open to
suggestion and physically weak. It also causes memory loss. The
pill's lack of taste and odor has led some men to drop it in the
drinks of unwitting women, who later have reported being raped.</TE>
<TE>   4. A condition in which the opening of the penis isn't found in
its normal spot. The opening may occur anywhere along the underside
of the penis.</TE>
<TE>   5. The New Orleans Times-Picayune won both of its Pulitzers in
1997. The paper won the Public Service award for a series called
"Oceans of Trouble" and another for editorial cartooning.</TE>

<HD>Employers Test Ruling on Immigrants</HD>
<DH>Labor: Some firms are trying to use Supreme Court decision
as basis for avoiding claims over workplace violations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Employers across the nation are testing the limits of a recent
Supreme Court decision to deny back pay to an undocumented worker,
seeking to use the ruling to avoid minimum wage and workers'
compensation awards, even asking for the documents of a worker who
complained of sexual harassment, according to advocates for low-wage
workers.</LD>
<LD>   The swift employer response, along with widespread
misunderstanding of the court's intent, has heightened a sense of
distress building in immigrant communities through months of
recession and the war on terrorism, the advocates said.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone is reeling from this," said Della Bahan, a Pasadena
attorney representing immigrant janitors in a class-action lawsuit
alleging wage and hour violations. "It's created a lot of confusion
and a lot of fear. However it's ultimately interpreted, the overall
message is, 'You complain at your peril.'"</LD>
<TE>   On March 27, the high court ruled 5 to 4 that because he was
undocumented, a worker at a chemical plant in Paramount could not
collect thousands of dollars in back pay after he was illegally fired
for union-organizing activities. The court determined that the
worker's violation of immigration law overrode the employer's
violation of labor laws.</TE>
<TE>   In the written decision and during oral arguments, the majority
made clear they did not intend to abolish all workplace rights for
illegal immigrants. However, dissenters on the court, along with
labor unions, immigrant-rights groups and a coalition of business
groups that filed briefs on behalf of the worker, argued that such a
ruling would increase exploitation by unscrupulous employers.</TE>
<TE>   Some say that already has happened.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing, the quickness of the employer response to this,"
said Ana Avendano Denier, an attorney with the United Food and
Commercial Workers Union, which represents thousands of immigrant
workers in meat and poultry plants. "Some are intentionally reading
it too broadly, but there's also a lot of misunderstanding about what
the court said."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, she said, a worker filing a sexual harassment
complaint at a Kentucky poultry plant was allegedly asked for her
immigration documents, as was a meatpacking worker in Nebraska who
filed a workers' compensation claim after a 30-foot fall. Because
both cases are being handled through the union grievance process,
Denier said she could not supply the names of the employers.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, the owner of a Manhattan meat market who is accused
of paying his immigrant work force less than the minimum wage warned
an advocacy group not to demonstrate in front of his store.</TE>
<TE>   "I am sure you are aware of the ruling by the Supreme Court of the
United States that illegal immigrants do not have the same rights as
U.S. citizens," the owner's attorney, Frederick Margolin, told the
group in a letter.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview last week, Margolin said he believed that a worker
fired from the market was not entitled to the difference between his
wages over five years and the minimum wage because "that's back pay."
He added that the employer probably knew the worker was undocumented
because "that's true of maybe 75% of the employees in the area."</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles jewelry manufacturer questioned an employee about
her immigration status during a workers' compensation hearing this
month and fired her after learning she was undocumented, according to
a union representative at the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Felipe Aguirre, a local organizer for the International Union of
Electricians-Communication Workers of America, said the employer,
Quadrtech Manufacturing, also cited the Supreme Court's ruling when
it canceled a proposed out-of-court settlement with employees who
were fired during a union-organizing campaign.</TE>
<TE>   A Quadrtech attorney did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   It probably will be years before the ruling is fully interpreted
by lower courts, attorneys said, although judges in state and federal
court--both in California--already have taken a narrow view of the
decision.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, a U.S. District Court judge decided the immigrant
status of supermarket janitors was not relevant in a class-action
suit that seeks to collect minimum wages for years of work. And a San
Diego Superior Court judge decided a taco stand worker who was paid
$2 an hour for seven years was entitled to $32,000 for missing
minimum wage. In both cases, employers had unsuccessfully cited the
Supreme Court decision.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, federal and state agencies are struggling to
understand how the decision affects their ability to protect
undocumented workers, if at all.</TE>
<TE>   For years, state and federal agencies have wrestled with the
sometimes conflicting goals of protecting workers while ensuring a
legal work force. This is particularly tricky when an undocumented
worker is fired illegally in retaliation for asserting rights on the
job. Typically, employers in such cases are ordered to reinstate the
worker and provide back pay for the time not worked. But if the
employee is undocumented, an order of reinstatement essentially
forces the employer to break the law.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1990s, as more such cases surfaced, federal agencies
including the National Labor Relations Board and the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission adopted a policy that seemed to resolve the
dilemma: Illegal immigrant workers would not be reinstated but would
receive back pay from the time they were fired to the point at which
employers learned of the employees' illegal status.</TE>
<TE>   The case that reached the Supreme Court was unusual because the
employer did not learn of the worker's illegal status until years
into the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   It was 1989 when the worker, known as Jose Castro, was fired from
his job at Hoffman Plastic Compounds Inc. After years of hearings and
appeals, Castro admitted he used false documents to obtain his job.
By then, the wages and penalties amounted to $67,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Allowing the Board to award back pay to illegal aliens would
unduly trench upon explicit statutory prohibitions critical to
federal immigration policy," wrote Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist. "It would encourage the successful evasion of apprehension
by immigration authorities, condone prior violations of the
immigration laws, and encourage future violations."</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department this week insisted that wage, hour and safety
regulations would be enforced "vigorously" for all workers,
regardless of immigration status. Yet the statement, issued in
Washington and Mexico City, failed to address the question of what
remedies undocumented workers have if they are fired for asserting
those protections.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman said Labor Department attorneys could only say they
"intend to protect employees from retaliatory discharge to the extent
possible." A similarly guarded statement was issued by the NLRB,
which said it will soon "be issuing guidance to the Agency's field
offices regarding how to handle legal and investigative issues
arising from the Hoffman decision."</TE>
<TE>   In California, the labor commissioner's office said it would
continue to investigate claims without regard to immigration status.
However, commission attorney Miles Locker noted if employers raise
the question of an employee's legal standing, it could affect the
state's ability to collect back pay in certain cases.</TE>
<TE>   More troubling, said worker advocates, is the widespread belief
among illegal immigrants that they no longer are protected under
state and federal labor laws, which has discouraged them from filing
complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been getting a lot of panicky phone calls," said Liz
Sunwoo, an outreach worker with the Korean Immigrant Workers Assn.
"They're afraid if they step forward now, they'll be fired."</TE>
<TE>   That misunderstanding also has led many to drop contract
grievances and walk away from union-organizing campaigns, which
increasingly are targeting immigrant workers, said several union
activists. Yet several organizers in heavily immigrant industries
said the undocumented have long understood they take greater risks
when asserting their rights.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't see it affecting our organizing efforts," said Mike
Garcia, president of Service Employees International Union Local
1877, a statewide janitors' organization based in Los Angeles. "There
are very few instances where we've won back pay awards anyway....
What's more concerning to us is the overall increase of immigrant
hysteria that seems to be developing in this country."</TE>
<TE>   Dionisio Gonzalez, an organizer with the United Steelworkers Union
who filed the original case against Hoffman in 1989, said the ruling
undoubtedly will make it harder to persuade workers to join a union,
which he said could affect all workers regardless of status.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes it real difficult to convince someone to sign a union
card," Gonzalez said. "At Hoffman, I told them they were protected
under the law. I guess I was wrong."</TE>

<HD>Air Canada Plans Low-Fare Subsidiary</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>Seeking to attract low-paying customers after the plunge in lucrative
business air travel, Air Canada has unveiled its long-awaited
no-frills carrier, naming it Zip.</LD>
<LD>   Air Canada, the country's dominant airline and the world's
10th-biggest, said the wholly owned subsidiary will be based in
Calgary, Alberta, for service starting this summer in western Canada.</LD>
<LD>   The new carrier will take to the skies with six Boeing 737s, with
plans to expand that figure to 20 737s, all transferred from the main
Air Canada fleet.</LD>
<TE>   Zip will compete head-to-head with Air Canada's profitable rival
WestJet Airlines Ltd., which also is based in Calgary and operates a
fleet of 28 Boeing 737s.</TE>
<TE>   Zip will operate initially between Vancouver and Calgary. It will
replace existing Air Canada flights without changing the number or
frequency, the parent carrier said.</TE>
<TE>   "The low-fare carrier is a critical component of Air Canada's
response to growing consumer demand for low-fare travel that will
also allow us to reduce our costs dramatically," Air Canada President
and Chief Executive Robert Milton said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Milton is trying to steer Air Canada, which has 226 aircraft in
its mainline fleet and 102 in its regional carrier Jazz, toward the
low-fare or no-frills end of the market. The airline suffered a
record $788-million loss last year on the plunge in business travel.</TE>
<TE>   With the top eight U.S. carriers reporting a total loss of $2.4
billion in this year's first quarter, analysts expect Air Canada to
show a loss of about $184 million in the three months that ended
March 31 when it reports results May 2.</TE>
<TE>   Milton warned that Air Canada mainline service may no longer cover
certain short-haul markets.</TE>
<TE>   "Canadians tell us that they want Air Canada to continue serving
their communities, but our mainline operations in certain short-haul
markets may no longer be financially sustainable," he said.</TE>

<DH>The current tech slump hasn't fazed scientists at MIT.
President Charles M. Vest sees several key technological advances in
the decades ahead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The technology industry may be mired in recession, but a sense of
optimism still pervades the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</LD>
<LD>   The scientists and engineers on MIT's campus in Cambridge, Mass.,
aren't paying much attention to the current tech slump. Instead,
they're looking decades ahead.</LD>
<LD>   "This is an incredibly exciting period of science and technology
ahead of us," said Charles M. Vest, who has been president of the
famed engineering school since 1990.</LD>
<TE>   Though Vest acknowledges the shortcomings of technology, his
experience as a mechanical engineer has taught him not to dwell on
problems and instead to focus on solutions. Vest describes his vision
for the future and MIT's role in creating it.</TE>
<TE>   Question: What's the next frontier in technology?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: There is a tremendous amount of work across MIT and other
leading science and technology schools in all things that involve
nanoscale science and technology. This is an area where government
funding has increased--and ought to increase--because really bright
young people are asking themselves how they can take advantage of our
new capabilities in manipulating matter, structuring it and
organizing it right down to the level of individual atoms.</TE>
<TE>   We just won a competition to set up something for the Army called
the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnology. Some people think it's
science fiction, but this program is built around designing soft
materials, like fabrics. We want to reduce the amount of weight a
soldier has to carry from about 150 pounds to around 45 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why 45 pounds?</TE>
<TE>   A: That's what a Roman centurion used to wear. One of the ways of
doing this is to design materials that have multiple functions, such
as a material that suddenly becomes rigid by passing electric current
to it. If you break your arm, you've got an instant cast. Then there
are materials that sense biological agents, or things that can change
color so you have a chameleon-like camouflage.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What other areas do you see as key?</TE>
<TE>   A: A second area that we believe is a great scientific adventure
for the next several decades is understanding the human brain. We now
have a very detailed understanding of how cells function.
Simultaneously, we have this great advance in functional magnetic
resonance imaging. You get detailed looks into what's going on
chemically in the brain as it reacts to various stimuli. That could
help us understand diseases such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's. On
top of this come the enormous capabilities in computing power and our
increasing understanding of how you think about complex systems. If
it all works, hopefully we can get the same kinds of advances for
emotional illnesses that we have made in the last 20 or 30 years for
more physical kinds of illness.</TE>
<TE>   There are two more areas I'd like to point out. After the
sequencing of the human genome, there's a whole new world of biology
and biotechnology. It's made possible by the combination of truly
massive computing power and our ability to understand biology down to
the level of proteins. It's going to lead to new mechanisms for drug
discovery and so forth.</TE>
<TE>   The last thing I would point to is the area of energy and the
environment and what sustainable development means to society. That's
going to be very, very important. We're trying to get away from the
remediation view of the environment and do a better job of stewarding
our resources while still enabling countries to climb up the economic
ladder.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What do you think is the cause of the chronic shortage of
scientists and engineers in the U.S.?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think we're at a kind of shift in social values that does not
encourage people to go into areas such as science and engineering. In
my generation, you had people growing up wanting to be part of the
space program and sending people to the moon. Today, there are fewer
and fewer young people who want to devote themselves to anything that
takes long years of intense work to accomplish.</TE>
<TE>   When we first started seeing so many young people taking technical
and scientific degrees and then going to work on Wall Street, I
started to talk to them. When you get right down to it, the bottom
line is instant gratification. They want to do things where reaction
follows action really quickly. Of course money has a lot to do with
it. But I honestly believe the ability to see results happen so
quickly is at least as big a factor.</TE>
<TE>   Q: There's also been a hue and cry over the shortage of technology
managers. Is there something fundamentally flawed with technology
that requires this much labor?</TE>
<TE>   A: The basic answer is yes. Everything is simply too complicated.
I think on the whole, technology's been rather good to society. But
the need to educate people to manage technology is something that
universities by and large have not been doing. The primary reason is
that business schools and engineering schools have not talked to each
other.</TE>
<TE>   Q: One of the best-known institutions at MIT is the Media Lab,
which helped give birth to things such as multimedia. But one of the
great criticisms of the Media Lab is that it develops stuff that is
not related to the real world. Are you moving away from that?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's returning closer to the original vision. You have a lot
more actual physics and focus on devices, with people doing work on
things like quantum computing. In the next few years, there's going
to be some growth in the emphasis on the arts. There's always been a
lot of emphasis on educational issues, and that group is picking up.</TE>
<TE>   Like all good science and technology, some of our projects have
moved off into unanticipated directions. A good example is the work
that started around musical instruments that respond to body motions.
It ended up being directly applied in car seat safety by Ford Motor
Co. The sensor technology that they used could tell whether you're
big or small and how you're moving. It has begun to be built into a
"smart" car seat that can respond appropriately to who's in it and
what the situation is.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've worked to increase research funds from corporations and
individuals. Do you think the research will be affected by their
agendas?</TE>
<TE>   A: Anything that broadens the range of who sponsors research is
generally good. Back in the 1960s, over 90% of our sponsored research
was funded by the federal government, and the government has always
had an agenda.</TE>
<TE>   We've worked hard to reach industry in new and different ways, and
now a little over 20% of our research is sponsored by industry. We
have a corporate partnership with [biotech firm] Amgen doing basic
biology. We have another one with Merrill Lynch in financial
technologies, and we're working with [chemical manufacturer] DuPont
on biologically developed materials processing.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is this research you'd be doing anyway?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes. If the faculty isn't finding things they want to work on,
then we won't do it. Are there dangers if schools lean too much on
industry? Yes. But I think the bigger threats come from [faculty]
starting small companies and being distracted.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is this less of a concern now that tech companies are in a
slump?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes. But anybody who thinks the dot-com bust eliminated the
entrepreneurial spirit is crazy. It's now a part of us, and it ought
to be a part of us. It's going to move into these new areas, and
hopefully it'll be more productive. Entrepreneurship is still very,
very important.</TE>

<LD>Fran Blinebury of the Houston Chronicle writes that he's bored with
the Rockets, who failed to make the NBA playoffs: "The Rockets are
like a painting of black cows in a field at night. There's nothing to
see.... I would rather watch grass grow, paint peel, water boil or
snails race than watch another season, month, week or single game of
this....</LD>
<LD>   "There is dishwater that isn't as dull as this act. Oatmeal that
isn't this bland."</LD>
<LD>   Trivia time: Who holds the Laker record for points in a playoff
game?</LD>
<TE>   Confident: Chris Webber of the Sacramento Kings, commenting to
Mark Kreidler of the Sacramento Bee on the team's improvement this
year: "Mentally, I think we're miles ahead of last year. Myself, I
think I'm a better player, a stronger player mentally ... and I think
our team is stronger."</TE>
<TE>   Bargain digits: Bud Geracie in the San Jose Mercury News: "Chicago
Cub broadcaster Jesse Rogers to Antonio Alfonseca, the pitcher with
six fingers and toes: 'Were you born that way?' No, he got a deal on
them."</TE>
<TE>   More Geracie: "New Raider linebacker Roman Phifer has a middle
name, Zubinski, that was picked out of a phone book by his father."</TE>
<TE>   What city isn't? Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle:
"Building an equestrian venue for the next summer Olympics in Athens,
workers unearth the remains of an ancient brothel. So already Athens
is more exciting than Salt Lake City."</TE>
<TE>   He can't relate: An interviewer once asked Arnold Palmer which
golfers he watched on television when he was a youngster. Said the
King, 72: "When I was a youngster, they had just discovered radio."</TE>
<TE>   Mind blowing: Comedy writer Alex Kaseberg in the San Francisco
Chronicle: "Tiger Woods won the Masters, and in another sporting
development that was just as shocking, a Kenyan won the Boston
Marathon the next day. The next shocker: a horse will win the
Kentucky Derby."</TE>
<TE>   Throwing in the towel: Ray Allen of the Milwaukee Bucks on the
state of the team before it failed to make the playoffs: "We've gone
all the way to the top, and we've gone all the way to the bottom.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever cockiness we had, or swagger we had, is gone. Our
confidence to win games is gone."</TE>
<TE>   Carrying charges: Dave Boling in the Tacoma (Wash.) News Tribune:
"If Tiger tips the usual 10% of his winnings, then his caddie has
earned more money from the tour than David Duval has this year."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1977, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar set a Laker
playoff record with nine blocked shots against Golden State.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Elgin Baylor, with 61, against the Boston Celtics
on April 14, 1962. The Lakers won, 126-122, but the Celtics won the
NBA Finals in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Before Oregon quarterback Joey Harrington became the
third player picked in the NFL draft by the Detroit Lions, he took
the New York Giants' 480-question personality test, which included
the question, "Do you enjoy beating animals?"</TE>
<TE>   Harrington told CNNSI.com: "I wondered, if you're a linebacker,
should you answer yes?"</TE>

<HD>Long Beach State Averts a Sweep</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long Beach State may have taken a hit on a national scale with losses
to slumping Miami in the first two games of a weekend nonconference
baseball series. But the 49ers hit back on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Right fielder Nick Covarrubias had three of the 49ers' 16 hits and
drove in four runs in a 10-1 victory that enabled Long Beach (25-12)
to avoid a three-game sweep at Coral Gables, Fla. Nate Beucler (2-1)
gave up four hits in six innings and Chris Demaria got his second
save with three shutout innings in relief.</LD>
<LD>   "Nate has been doing well ever since he got back from injury,"
Long Beach Coach Mike Weathers said. "He beat a team today that is
fighting for its [postseason] life."</LD>
<TE>   Defending national champion Miami (20-19) has struggled. The
Hurricanes responded with a 9-6 victory on Kevin Howard's walk-off
three-run homer in the ninth Friday, then battered three 49er
pitchers in a 10-6 victory Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   With Long Beach playing out of conference, No. 15 Cal State
Fullerton (27-12, 10-2) jumped into first place in the Big West with
a three-game sweep at UC Santa Barbara. Cal State Northridge (29-13,
9-3) is one game back after sweeping Sacramento State.</TE>
<TE>   In the Pacific 10 Conference, USC (24-16, 9-4) pulled into first
place by scoring 43 runs and winning three games at Washington State.
UCLA (18-24, 4-5) won two of three at Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine (22-21, 11-5) maintained a one-game lead over Gonzaga
in the West Coast Conference Coast Division by sweeping a three-game
series against visiting San Francisco. Gonzaga swept three games from
visiting Loyola Marymount (16-25, 9-8).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Pepperdine (26-4) earned the right to play host to the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation men's volleyball semifinals and
championship match this week by defeating Cal State Northridge,
30-18, 30-25, 31-29, in a first-round match Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves will play Thursday against Brigham Young and UC Santa
Barbara (18-10) will play Hawaii in the other semifinal after
upsetting UCLA.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel"</LD>
<LD>   Where: HBO, tonight, 10</LD>
<TE>   Bryant Gumbel, the host of the show, occasionally will do an
interview if the subject warrants it. Apparently, Nolan Richardson
warrants it.</TE>
<TE>   Gumbel's interview with the former Arkansas basketball coach, who
was fired in March, is even-handed and thorough. The problem is
Arkansas Athletic Director Frank Broyles and all other school
officials declined to be interviewed. So we get only Richardson's
side.</TE>
<TE>   But Gumbel keeps things on an even keel and doesn't let Richardson
off the hook for some of his actions, including his emotional tirade
at a news conference Feb. 25. Richardson claimed the media, fans and
school administrators treated him unfairly because he is black.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson doesn't back off much. Asked by Gumbel if things would
have been different had there been African American reporters
covering him, Richardson says, "I think so. I think they'd understand
me better. I think they would listen to me differently."</TE>
<TE>   Other segments include an investigation of steroid smuggling, a
profile of Rasheed Wallace and a look at NFL combines.</TE>

<KH>Chris Dufresne SECOND THOUGHTS</KH>
<HD>There's a Great Draft Pick Born Every Five Minutes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tick, tick, tick, Second Thoughts is still on the clock, desperately
trying to trade down to stockpile items for use in later columns.</LD>
<LD>   News item: NFL concludes 67th annual draft.</LD>
<LD>   Second thought: Best first-round pick: Jimmy Johnson (ESPN). It's
not fair. The former Dallas Cowboy and Miami Dolphin coach walks off
his yacht, dabs a little 30-weight through his hair and dominates
draft day with his spot-on analysis and anecdotal insight. Johnson
even had a better hair weekend than Mel Kiper Jr.</LD>
<TE>   Worst first-round pick: Levi Jones (Cincinnati). The Bengals
remain on the cutting edge. Too bad that's where most of their draft
picks end up.</TE>
<TE>   For the 67th year, all NFL teams nabbed just the player they
wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo was thrilled to get Texas tackle Mike Williams with the
fourth pick ("No way he has a knee injury").</TE>
<TE>   San Diego was ecstatic to land Texas cornerback Quentin Jammer
("It worked out perfectly for us").</TE>
<TE>   Dallas says Roy Williams is a "difference maker," Jacksonville
thinks John Henderson is "a heck of a player," ESPN's Chris Berman
tells the New York Giants, "You got your man" in tight end Jeremy
Shockey and adds, "You did the right thing there" when Cleveland
Coach Butch Davis takes tailback William Green. Atlanta Coach Dan
Reeves says running back T.J. Duckett was "definitely a guy we
couldn't pass up," and tight end Daniel Graham, the New England
selection, was described as "one of the slam dunks of this draft."</TE>
<TE>   All of which makes us wonder: Whatever happened to Tony Mandarich?</TE>
<TE>   At least the NFL draft provided a welcome respite from
minute-to-minute updates concerning Robert Horry's abdomen.</TE>
<TE>   News item: NBA playoffs begin.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: I confess to having drifted away from the pro game
in recent years, but when push comes to shove I like the New Orleans
Jazz, Philadelphia Warriors, Kansas City Kings and Buffalo Braves,
also the Phoenix Suns if the Van Arsdale brothers can avoid injuries.</TE>
<TE>   News item: ESPN broadcaster Stuart "Boo-Yaa" Scott injures eye
while working out with the New York Jets.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: This just in from broadcaster fantasy camp: John
Madden cancels his annual "bear-crawl" session with the New York
Giants while venerable Verne Lundquist announces he will no longer do
"gassers" during two-a-days with the St. Louis Rams.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Giant, mountain-size asteroid threatens to hit Earth in
800 years.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Based on what we've seen lately on Fox's "Best
Damn Sports Show Period," it can't get here soon enough.</TE>
<TE>   News item: AT&amp;T withdraws Rose Bowl sponsorship.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Industry pundits are blaming this on the "The Rose
Bowl, presented by Nebraska."</TE>
<TE>   News item: College football officials mull changes to dreaded bowl
championship series.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: What's to mull? The powers that be ought to tear
into this formula like Tony Siragusa into a roast beef on rye.</TE>
<TE>   At meetings in Phoenix last week, the six BCS conference
commissioners failed to pull the trigger on changing the
controversial formula.</TE>
<TE>   Our one-step remedy: remove the computer component from the BCS
standings and keep the remaining three components in the formula:
poll average, schedule strength and losses (one point assessed for
each). You also can 86 the quality-win brain cramp.</TE>
<TE>   Had there been no computer component the last two years, justice
would have prevailed. Oklahoma would have played Miami in the 2001
Orange Bowl and Miami and Oregon would have met in the 2002 Rose
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Final 2000 BCS standings without computers? 1) Oklahoma (1.44), 2)
Miami (3.12), 3) Florida State (4.08).</TE>
<TE>   Final 2001 BCS standings without computers? 1) Miami (2.62), 2)
Oregon (4.24), 3) Colorado (5.08), 4) Nebraska (5.56).</TE>
<TE>   Let the computer geeks go back to doing what they do best: letting
us look over their shoulders on history exams and burning bugs with
magnifying glasses.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Fifty-one percent of people in survey say they'd be
willing to have their pinkie toe amputated for a chance to play at
Augusta National Golf Course.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: I'd almost give my right arm never to have
stumbled upon this item in USA Today.</TE>
<TE>   News item: USA Today reports wrestler Rulon Gardner keeps in a
plastic container the toe he had amputated because of frostbite.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: What is it with USA Today and toes?</TE>
<TE>   News item: Tiger Woods wins third Masters championship.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Proposed changes for next year's tournament: Woods
required to start play in Augusta, Maine.</TE>
<TE>   Woods hits off back tees, all other golfers use reds. OK if Fuzzy
Zoeller hits off a mat.</TE>
<TE>   No golfers allowed to wear red Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   No spectators allowed within 100 yards of Sam Snead's ceremonial
drive.</TE>
<TE>   "Course management" specialists allowed to accompany Vijay Singh
and Ernie Els.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Phil Mickelson's sister, Tina, wonders how much greater
her golf-star brother would be had Tiger Woods been born in another
era.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: A fascinating hypothetical, although the data
suggest had Tiger Woods become an accountant, Phil still would be 0
for 39 in the major tournaments--Masters, U.S. Open, British Open and
PGA Championship. Mickelson did not finish second in any of the seven
majors won by Woods. Mickelson's only second-place posting in a major
came at the 1999 U.S. Open, at which he finished one shot behind
winner Payne Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   That settled, we return to ponder how many more NBA titles the
Lakers might have won had Bill Russell become a dentist.</TE>
<TE>   News item: MTV cable show "The Osbournes" getting rave reviews.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Thinking this was a wholesome family show about
the former Nebraska football coach and current U.S. congressman
("Honey, I'll be home as soon as we pass the soy bean subsidy bill"),
I was shocked to discover the MTV series is based on rock star Ozzy
Osbourne, the former Black Sabbath singer who has done a
extraordinary 180-degree turn on a career whose lowlights include
biting the head off a live dove and relieving himself publicly in San
Antonio ... on the Alamo.</TE>

<HD>Benchmark Victory for Garcia</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Trainer gets his first Grade I stakes win as
Ringaskiddy prevails on Santa Anita's closing day.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Native Desert remains the best claim longtime trainer Juan Garcia has
made, but Ringaskiddy is gaining ground.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-year-old accomplished something on Santa Anita's closing day
that his older stablemate, despite his numerous successes, has not.</LD>
<LD>   Ringaskiddy, a 10-1 longshot in the $400,000 San Juan Capistrano
Invitational Handicap, finished powerfully under jockey Eddie
Delahoussaye to become Garcia's first Grade I winner. Completing the
marathon distance in 2:442/5, he defeated Staging Post, the 5-1
fourth choice in the field of eight, by 31/2 lengths.</LD>
<TE>   Claimed by Garcia and partner Leonard Scofield for $50,000 on Jan.
13, 2001, Ringaskiddy nearly quintupled that figure with a $240,000
score Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   In his 44 previous races, the gelded son of Slewvescent had earned
$352,471, usually settling for minor prizes. He has six career wins,
11 seconds and seven thirds.</TE>
<TE>   In becoming the first California-bred to win Santa Anita's longest
race since Queen's Hustler in 1973, Ringaskiddy provided Delahoussaye
with his third San Juan victory in the last six years.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, 59, noted that Ringaskiddy had a little trouble when he
was a close fourth in last month's San Luis Rey Stakes, but "this
time everything was perfect."</TE>
<TE>   "Eddie just sat and waited and when everybody started to go wide,
he saved all the ground," Garcia added. "We claimed him because he
was the kind of horse that could run a mile or a mile and a half."</TE>
<TE>   Staging Post, trying to give trainer Bobby Frankel his fifth Grade
I win of the meet, finished three lengths clear of San Luis Rey
winner Continental Red, then came 7-5 favorite Cagney, Chelsea
Barracks, Keemoon, pacesetter Speedy Pick and Dispersed Reward.</TE>
<TE>   Kerrygold, who would have been coupled in the betting with Chelsea
Barracks, and Soul Warrior were scratched earlier in the day.</TE>
<TE>   Returning to the turf after finishing fifth in the Santa Anita
Handicap on March 2, Cagney was wide under jockey Mike Smith in a
disappointing effort.</TE>
<TE>   "He started [lugging] out on me when he ran in the Japan Cup [Nov.
25] and, for some odd reason, he did it again today," Smith said. "As
the race continued, he got worse and worse. He had been training
great, doing well, and he came back fine.</TE>
<TE>   "Halfway down the backside, I was hanging on one rein, just trying
to keep him on the course."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Delahoussaye couldn't complete a stakes sweep because Swept
Overboard, the even-money favorite in the $125,000 San Simeon
Handicap, ran poorly in his first start of 2002, finishing fifth in
the field of nine.</TE>
<TE>   Malabar Gold, who was fourth as the 2-5 favorite in last year's
San Simeon, won Sunday, edging Astonished by a head to win in a
stakes record 1:113/5 for about 61/2 furlongs on turf. Chris McCarron
rode the 7-2 second choice for owner B. Wayne Hughes and trainer Ron
Ellis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Buoyed by excellent weather, large, competitive fields and 25
pick-six carryovers, Santa Anita showed an 8.6% gain in average daily
handle and a 10.6% rise in total handle for the season.</TE>
<TE>   The average daily on-track attendance declined, however, dropping
from 10,486 during the 2000-01 season to 9,930.</TE>
<TE>   The combined average daily attendance, which factors in the
various simulcast facilities, was down 1.5% from the preceding meet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jockey Alex Solis led the riders with 76 victories, six more than
Kent Desormeaux, and Bob Baffert won his sixth consecutive training
title at Santa Anita, finishing with 43 winners. Bill Spawr was
second with 32.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Aggressive, who won his third in a row in Saturday's eighth race,
won't be joining the Jerry Hollendorfer barn.</TE>
<TE>   A $20,000 claim by Hollendorfer and co-owner Peter Abruzzo was
voided because Aggressive was misspelled on the claim slip.</TE>
<TE>   There is a California Horse Racing Board rule that nullifies a
claim if the horse's name is spelled wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, Aggressive, a 5-year-old gelding who has raced only
five times, remains with trainer Paul Assinesi.</TE>

<HD>Laker Fans Should Buckle Up for Ride Ahead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Find the most comfortable seat in the house. Make sure the
refrigerator is stocked. Keep the ibuprofen handy. If you want
something scenic, go take a walk on the beach.</LD>
<LD>   This Laker playoff run is going to be a lot like Sunday's 95-87
victory over Portland in Game 1. Long and laborious. Grinding. Not
pretty.</LD>
<LD>   "It may be that way this year," Rick Fox said. "We may not have
the sort of dominant outcome that people are used to seeing.</LD>
<TE>   "As long as we're winning, we can discuss later how aesthetically
pleasing to the eye it is."</TE>
<TE>   As one indication of how tough this is going to be, I've gone to
the Rick Fox card after only one game. Fox quotes are the white
chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake of the Laker locker room:
always just as good as you expect, but you can't have it too much. So
normally I try to put him off for stretches, or avoid him for weeks
at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Well, the diet is officially off.</TE>
<TE>   So is any pretense of balance in the Laker attack, which is a
reason that their title defense will be so difficult.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers seem more reliant on Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant
than ever. They made seven of the team's eight field goals in the
first quarter, 11 of the 15 in the first half and 20 of 32 for the
game.</TE>
<TE>   The only other Laker to reach double figures in scoring was Derek
Fisher, and he didn't get there until he made a three-pointer with
3:44 left in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Good help is going to be hard to find. And don't expect it to come
from some unexpected source.</TE>
<TE>   If Game 1 was any indication, Phil Jackson is keeping his rotation
tighter than a Britney Spears outfit. He straight-up said before the
game that he is "not very comfortable" with using Mark Madsen and
Slava Medvedenko at power forward. Lindsey Hunter made a token
appearance and we might not see Mitch Richmond again until the
victory parade.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the parade is a sure thing. In fact, here's the only
thing you can guarantee: the Lakers won't sweep through the Western
Conference again.</TE>
<TE>   We should get a good chance to see the comparison between then and
now, because it's likely that the Lakers, if they get far enough,
will face the same three opponents: Portland, San Antonio and
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Portland already has closed the gap a little bit. The Trail
Blazers weren't within 13 points of the Lakers at the end of any
playoff game last season. Now they seem ready to hang in and put up a
fight, as opposed to last year's debacle when they melted down into a
towel-tossing, referee-attacking mess that posed a threat only to
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be one of those series where we're going to have to
read," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   As opposed to what, just looking at the pictures?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, this is going to take some effort, both playing and watching.
It will require stamina. Jackson went on to talk about stuff like
"specials," "automatics" and "pressure releases," but the key word in
his descent into basketball jargon was "survive."</TE>
<TE>   That probably will be the theme of these playoffs, and that's what
the Lakers did Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   With the Trail Blazers surrounding O'Neal throughout the first
half and Bryant misfiring on all six shots in the second quarter, it
was a two-point game at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   But eventually they found a way to get the ball to O'Neal, who
worked his way through the double- and triple-teams to score 25 of
his toughest points of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant--who had to shoot out of necessity because O'Neal was
closed off for so long--started driving through the lane and managed
to connect on 10 of his 28 (!) shots and 12 of 13 free throws to
score 34 points.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher grabbed six rebounds, Robert Horry did a lot of Robert
Horry stuff and the Lakers did what they always seem to do ...
eventually, when they really set their minds to it. But they couldn't
feel comfortable until the final two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "The second half is indicative of the way this team wins
championships," Portland Coach Maurice Cheeks said.</TE>
<TE>   It's going to take lots of little stuff, lots of patience and
probably a few setbacks for them to get their third. They aren't
dominating. They're not on a roll. No one's afraid of them.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be a stressful run," Fox said. "It's good to
know we've been under stress before and know how to handle it."</TE>
<TE>   It's even better for them to know they have Shaq and Kobe.</TE>
<TE>   So even after what O'Neal called "kind of a dismal season," the
Lakers are the team that will either win the championship or have to
be defeated by the team that does.</TE>
<TE>   "They're at the top and they deserve to have some arrogance,"
Portland forward Scottie Pippen said.</TE>
<TE>   Pippen knows a thing or two about three-peating. In Chicago, he
and Michael Jordan were the only players to do it twice, from 1991-93
and again from 1996-98. Is the third one the toughest?</TE>
<TE>   "They're all hard," Pippen said. "You can't compare them. Every
year is a different year, it's a different challenge. It's whether or
not they're motivated and up for the challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Motivation was a missing element most of the season for the
Lakers. Maybe it has returned now that the playoffs are back.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a greater challenge, which brings greater excitement....
Not only do we have to defend our championships, but we have a lot to
prove to a lot of people that have second-guessed us," Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   So get ready for even more challenges, more close games ... and
more Rick Fox quotes.</TE>

<HD>Turnabout Is Fair Play for the Twins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Minnesota Twins found themselves on the winning side this
weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Rick Reed had his most effective outing of the season Sunday,
helping the Twins complete a three-game sweep of the Cleveland
Indians with a 4-2 victory at Minneapolis.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, the Indians swept a four-game series from Minnesota at
Jacobs Field.</LD>
<TE>   "We just didn't play very well in Cleveland," Reed said. "Once we
got here, we started playing good baseball."</TE>
<TE>   The victory completed an 8-1 homestand for the Twins, who moved
back into first place in the AL Central. Cleveland left home with an
11-1 record and returned a week later after going 0-6 on a trip to
Chicago and Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like we switched roles," Cleveland's Matt Lawton
said. "At home, we got the key hits with guys in scoring position,
and they didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Reed (2-1) limited the Indians to a two-run homer by Jim Thome in
61/3 innings, his longest outing this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians held a brief team meeting after the game, and Manager
Charlie Manuel told the team to not overreact.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them to get their heads up because we've got a long way to
go," Manuel said. "I've been wanting to talk to them for a couple of
days now."</TE>
<TE>   Boston 12-8, Kansas City 2-7--Johnny Damon highlighted his huge
weekend at Kansas City by hitting a grand slam to help the Red Sox
complete a doubleheader sweep. Damon also homered in the first game
and Manny Ramirez homered twice.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox have won six in a row, their best streak since winning
six consecutive games in May 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Facing the team he played for from 1995-2000, Damon went eight for
13, scored seven runs and drove in six during the series. He had four
hits to help Boston complete a three-game sweep.</TE>
<TE>   In the first game, John Burkett scattered seven hits in five
innings to win in his season debut. Burkett, who began the season on
the disabled list with a sore shoulder, gave up two runs, struck out
two and walked one.</TE>
<TE>   New York 9, Toronto 2--Roger Clemens was simply dominating at
Yankee Stadium, taking a one-hit shutout into the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   After going 20-3 last season and winning a record sixth Cy Young
Award, Clemens (2-2) has struggled this season. Following Shannon
Stewart's two-out single in the third, Clemens didn't give up another
hit until Toronto scored on doubles by Felipe Lopez and Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   Clemens gave up two runs and three hits in 71/3 innings, struck
out eight and walked three. He lowered his earned-run average from
6.46 to 5.52 and improved to 22-11 against the Blue Jays, and 7-1
since they traded him to the Yankees three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 5, Texas 3--Alex Rodriguez homered twice in a game against
the Mariners for the second time this season, but his offense wasn't
enough for the Rangers at Safeco Field.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers fell to 5-13 for the team's worst start. They have
lost 12 of their last 14 against Seattle and are 6-21 since Rodriguez
left the Mariners after the 2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez has hit five of his eight homers this season against his
former team. Fans at Seattle booed him and tossed paper money in all
three games of the series.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 11, Detroit 8--Pinch-hitter Ray Durham hit a tiebreaking
single in the seventh inning at Chicago and the White Sox won for the
10th time in 12 games. Bobby Higginson homered, doubled and drove in
four runs for Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 2, Baltimore 1--Ben Grieve hit a tiebreaking,
run-scoring single in the eighth inning at St. Petersburg, Fla. Jason
Tyner hit a two-out single against Sidney Ponson and went to second
on Randy Winn's single. Grieve drove in Tyner with a single against
Erik Bedard.</TE>

<DH>Angels: Closer gives up game-winning homer to Myers in 6-5
loss to A's.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Troy Percival and Greg Myers live on the same street in
Riverside--three houses apart, Myers said. When winter comes, perhaps
the two can share memories of the home run that ended Sunday's game.</LD>
<LD>   But not today, not after Myers hit the game-winning three-run home
run off Percival that sent the Angels to another disheartening
defeat. The Angels played eight inspired innings, rallying for three
runs in the eighth to erase a 3-2 deficit, and handed their closer a
two-run lead in the ninth, but Percival failed to record an out. On
what he said was the first walk-off homer of his career, Myers sent
his good buddy and his old team to the showers as 6-5 losers to the
Oakland Athletics.</LD>
<LD>   "He's a good friend of mine," Percival said. "But that doesn't
mean I want to throw a pitch and give up a home run to him."</LD>
<TE>   It's still April, but the Angels flew to Seattle on Sunday night
already 81/2 games behind the first-place Mariners. Pitcher Aaron
Sele insisted the Angels would not panic and did not need to concern
themselves with beating Seattle this week at the risk of falling too
far behind the Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   "That's like saying we're down by five runs so we need to hit a
five-run home run," Sele said. "You can't do that. You have to take
it day by day."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels won one of four games here, and in the victory they
blew all but two runs of a six-run lead. In the defeats, the Angels
lost a lead in the sixth inning Thursday, the eighth inning Saturday
and the ninth inning Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Percival gave up three hits. Miguel Tejada and Terrence Long
singled. Myers, who had a pinch-hit single off Percival Friday, came
off the bench again and delivered.</TE>
<TE>   Percival didn't need a scouting report to tell him that Myers
could hit a fastball over the plate. On a 2-and-0 pitch, that's what
Myers got.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody in baseball knows he's a dead-red hitter," Percival
said. "It doesn't matter how hard you throw it. If you don't hit your
spots, he's going to get you."</TE>
<TE>   In his second appearance since coming off the disabled list,
Percival said his arm was sharp but his mind was not. He
second-guessed which pitches he threw and said he did not use his
curveball enough.</TE>
<TE>   "This one really stunk," Percival said.</TE>
<TE>   Percival appears to be throwing as hard as ever, Myers said, hard
enough to get outs on his fastball alone when thrown to the proper
spots.</TE>
<TE>   "Troy is the kind of guy who can throw all fastballs and make it a
tough at-bat," Myers said. "He left [the home-run pitch] a little
more up than he wanted to."</TE>
<TE>   The home run obscured the weekend emergence of the Angel offense,
which hit .283 for the four-game series and scored 21 runs over the
final three games. Garret Anderson had seven hits in the three games,
Bengie Molina had six, and Tim Salmon drove in four runs and reached
base seven times in 15 plate appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the focus was on Percival. In three appearances, he has
faced 11 batters. Seven have reached base, on three singles, two
walks and two home runs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the last guy on the club you worry about is Percy,"
Manager Mike Scioscia said.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>He Stays on Feet, and in the Lineup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>First Jim Edmonds, now Darin Erstad: The Angels' center fielder dives
all over the outfield, throwing his body in every direction, and
inevitably gets hurt at some point. The left fielder remains
standing; Garret Anderson rarely dives for a ball and never gets
hurt.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels moved Anderson to center field Sunday to replace
Erstad, out until at least Friday after suffering a mild concussion
while diving for a ball three days ago.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Mike Scioscia said Anderson would return to left field
when Erstad returned to the lineup, raising two questions: How much
does Anderson's oft-derided playing style help explain his consistent
production on offense? And would the Angels be smarter to play
Anderson in center field--his preferred position--and Erstad at first
base?</LD>
<TE>   In his eight years in the major leagues, Anderson never has been
on the disabled list and has emerged as the Angels' most dependable
hitter. He has played in 334 of the Angels' last 338 games, and he
said his reluctance to dive for balls has "a lot to do with" his
durability.</TE>
<TE>   Said Anderson: "That's not saying I don't play hard. But I'm not
going to hit the ground just to hit the ground and prove something to
anybody. If I wasn't playing well in the outfield, I wouldn't be out
there. I don't hit 55 home runs, where that would validate my playing
out there every day regardless of my defense."</TE>
<TE>   Ron Roenicke, the Angels' outfield coach, said that "there will be
a time he will miss a ball by six feet without diving." But Roenicke
also said he believes there is no better left fielder than Anderson
in the major leagues today.</TE>
<TE>   Roenicke, noting that Erstad played 157 games in each of the last
two seasons, said telling him to tone down his diving or crashing
into fences would reduce his effectiveness by forcing him to hesitate
and think on each play rather than react on instinct.</TE>
<TE>   "You want a guy in center field who plays that way," Roenicke
said. "If he gets hurt, that's part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Erstad won a Gold Glove as an outfielder two years ago. Scioscia
said the Angels have discussed--and for now rejected--the option of
moving Erstad to first to reduce his risk of injury and keep his bat
in the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "Darin is very resilient," Scioscia said. "The question is, where
is he going to have more of an impact, as an outstanding center
fielder or an outstanding first baseman? Right now, for us, there's
no question that it's Erstad in center."</TE>
<TE>   Erstad returned to Southern California Sunday and will be examined
today by Angel physician Craig Milhouse. Athletic trainer Ned Bergert
said Milhouse could order neurological studies to assess Erstad's
memory and balance.</TE>
<TE>   Bergert said Erstad was still "in a haze" Sunday. Doctors will not
clear him to return until he has been free of symptoms, most notably
headaches, for several days.</TE>
<TE>   While a Friday return represents an optimistic scenario rather
than a firm timetable, Scioscia said the Angels plan to wait several
days before deciding whether to put Erstad on the 15-day disabled
list.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>The Colorado Rockies couldn't hit Randy Johnson on Sunday. They
couldn't rattle him, either.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson struck out 17 and pitched a two-hitter for his major
league-leading fifth victory, and the Arizona Diamondbacks defeated
the Rockies, 7-1.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson received an adrenaline boost in the sixth when he struck
out pinch-hitter Terry Shumpert to begin the inning.</LD>
<TE>   Shumpert stared at the mound and Johnson stared at Shumpert. The
hard looks led to some catcalls from the Colorado dugout.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not important [what was said]," Johnson said. "It helped
motivate me."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona first baseman Mark Grace said he has been on teams that
tried bench jockeying against Johnson, only to learn not to bother.</TE>
<TE>   "The best thing you can do is keep your thoughts to yourself,"
Grace said. "You don't want to go making the big boy angry."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson (5-0) struck out Todd Helton to finish his sixth career
game with at least 17 strikeouts. His high is 20.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson matched teammate Curt Schilling for the most strikeouts in
a game this season. He leads the majors with 50 strikeouts in 39
innings.</TE>
<TE>   His fastball reached 101 mph and three of his last four pitches
were clocked at 100 mph. Johnson walked one.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona Manager Bob Brenly said he had planned to replace Johnson
with Byung-Hyun Kim to start the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'No, I will finish,'" Brenly said. "And I said, 'OK.'"</TE>

<HD>Guarding Shaq Proves to Be Taxing on Wallace</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Portland center Dale Davis did an adequate job Sunday of defending
Shaquille O'Neal in Game 1 of the opening-round series between the
Trail Blazers and Lakers. So did power forward Rasheed Wallace,
filling in after Davis went to the bench with five fouls with 8:11 to
play.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal scored only two points the rest of the way and had 25
points and nine rebounds by game's end.</LD>
<LD>   Trouble was, Wallace was doing such a good job on O'Neal that he
had little energy at the other end of the floor to help the Trail
Blazers rally for a victory. The Lakers held on for a 95-87 victory
partly because Wallace had only one basket, a three-pointer midway
through the fourth quarter, after moving to center.</LD>
<TE>   Portland Coach Maurice Cheeks feared having to play Wallace on
O'Neal for that very reason, saying before the game, "It takes a lot
out of anyone who has to guard Shaq and not just defensively, but
also on the offensive end. We'd like to keep Rasheed from having to
do it too much."</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Cheeks said, "I thought Dale was doing a very good
job on Shaq, as well as can be expected, but he continued to get
fouls. I think Rasheed had to guard him a little more than I wanted
and that takes away from his offense. We need him to score in order
to win."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace led the Trail Blazers with 25 points and 14 rebounds in 40
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cheeks didn't get all he wanted--or needed--from Bonzi Wells,
turning instead to Derek Anderson in the second half. Wells had eight
points, but missed eight of 12 shots. Anderson had 22 points on
eight-of-14 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't have a particularly good game," Cheeks said of Wells.
"Derek Anderson was playing pretty well at the time. He is the reason
I kept him in the game. I wanted him to attack the basket, which he
did. We need more out of a lot of guys."</TE>
<TE>   Said Anderson of the Lakers: "They won by being more aggressive.
They were more aggressive and we have to start doing that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers returned to Portland immediately after the game,
preferring to practice today and Tuesday at home before returning to
Staples Center to work out Wednesday. Game 2 is Thursday. They stayed
in L.A. for three days for a similar Sunday-Thursday schedule last

<HD>Furcal Gets the Triple Crown</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Atlanta shortstop ties modern major league record
with three triples.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>As the ball headed toward the seats, Rafael Furcal thought he had his
first homer of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the Atlanta speedster had to settle for a piece of
baseball history.</LD>
<LD>   Furcal tied the modern major league record with three triples
Sunday, scoring after each one to lead the Braves to their fourth
consecutive victory, 4-2 over the Florida Marlins.</LD>
<TE>   The record-tying hit came in the seventh, when Furcal sent a
towering drive to the gap in left-center. At first, he thought it was
a homer.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I hit the ball pretty good," he said. "When I saw it hit
the wall, I thought I would try for another triple."</TE>
<TE>   The ball short-hopped the wall, just out of the reach of Preston
Wilson. Furcal slapped his hands as he slid into third, becoming the
first major leaguer to hit three triples since Lance Johnson of the
Chicago White Sox on Sept. 23, 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Furcal was the first Brave to accomplish the feat since
Milwaukee's Danny O'Connell on June 13, 1956. Overall, six players in
franchise history have done it.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I don't think I've seen that in my 40 years," Manager
Bobby Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's exciting. A triple is what the fans like the most, sometimes
more than a homer, watching a guy speeding around the basepaths. They
sure got their money's worth with just him today."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Glavine (3-1) yielded only six hits in seven innings to beat
an old nemesis.</TE>
<TE>   The Marlins are one of three teams the left-hander has a losing
record against in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Always a strong starter, Glavine has pitched at least six innings
in each of his five starts, compiling a 1.08 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, it's been good," he said. "But I don't want to get ahead
of myself. I started off well last year, then I had a six-week period
where I stunk."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Spooneybarger and John Smoltz went an inning apiece to finish
off Florida. Smoltz struck out the side in the ninth to pick up his
sixth save in seven chances.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves have given up only six runs during their winning
streak, which pushed them back above .500 (10-9) and a game behind
Montreal in the NL East.</TE>

<HD>Tomko Tames Dodger Offense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers completed their 19-game, season-opening stretch against
National League West opponents Sunday with a 5-0 loss to the San
Diego Padres at Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Coming out on the short end of a shutout for the fourth time,
however, did not dissuade the Dodgers from believing they will
contend for their first division title since 1995.</LD>
<LD>   They have seen the West, with the exception of defending World
Series-champion Arizona, and their 11-8 record puts them 11/2 games
behind the first-place San Francisco Giants. Manager Jim Tracy said
"satisfactory" was the word he would use to describe his team's
performance to date.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm satisfied from what we've seen from the pitching standpoint
and I feel strongly that we're better offensively than what we've
shown to this point," Tracy said. "I'm satisfied with our defense.</TE>
<TE>   "But there is a ceiling to be reached with this club. We can be
better than we have been. We can be more consistent."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are off today and will open a six-game trip at
Pittsburgh on Tuesday, the first of 28 games outside the division.
They will not play another NL West foe until they open a three-game
series against the Diamondbacks at Phoenix on May 24.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can play like we're playing inside our division and play
extremely well outside, then we set ourselves up very well to have a
lot of fun this summer," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, it was Padre starter Brett Tomko (1-1) who enjoyed one
of the best performances of his career against a Dodger lineup that
lacked four regulars because Tracy rested catcher Paul Lo Duca, left
fielder Brian Jordan, shortstop Cesar Izturis and second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek.</TE>
<TE>   Tomko gave up two hits and struck out a career-high 13 in seven
innings as the Padres ended the Dodgers' four-game win streak before
48,469.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Nevin raised his batting average to .397 with a run-scoring
double against Andy Ashby in the first inning, a run-scoring single
in the fifth and solo home run against Terry Mulholland in the
seventh. Nevin's homer, his fourth this season and 100th as a Padre,
came after Trenidad Hubbard hit a two-run, pinch-hit homer against
Mulholland.</TE>
<TE>   Tomko, 29, was acquired in a six-player trade with the Seattle
Mariners last December. He struck out five of the first six batters
and struck out the side in the second and seventh innings.</TE>
<TE>   "In Seattle, I couldn't get out of the minor leagues during the
season," Tomko said. "Being traded to San Diego, I couldn't have
asked for a better situation."</TE>
<TE>   Tomko gave up a triple by Alex Cora with one out in the third
inning and a pinch-hit double by Izturis to start the sixth when the
Dodgers had their best chance of scoring.</TE>
<TE>   One out after Izturis doubled, Tomko walked Jeff Reboulet before
striking out Shawn Green and Eric Karros. Tomko's 13 strikeouts were
two shy of the Padre regular-season record of 15 set by Fred Norman
in 1972 and tied by Sterling Hitchcock in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "He threw strikes, but he wasn't over the middle of the plate,"
Karros said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was hitting corners and had a 94- to 95-mph fastball that he
was still throwing in the seventh inning."</TE>
<TE>   Ashby (1-2) gave up two runs and six hits in six innings but
struggled against the team he played for from 1993-1999. Ashby, who
had walked more than three batters in only eight of his last 68
starts, walked six Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Green said the Dodgers are looking forward to aiding their cause
by playing well outside the division. The Dodgers play Pittsburgh,
Chicago, Cincinnati, Atlanta, Florida, the New York Mets, Montreal
and Milwaukee before meeting the Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We just need to keep winning series, which is what we've been
doing lately," Green said. "If we do that, we're not going to lose
ground and we'll be right where we need to be."</TE>

<HD>Mulholland Is Hit Hard Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reliever Terry Mulholland made a throwing error and gave up
consecutive home runs in the seventh inning Sunday in the Dodgers'
5-0 loss to the San Diego Padres at Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   It was the third time in four appearances that the 39-year-old
left-hander has struggled.</LD>
<LD>   Mulholland's earned-run average is 15.26 in 72/3 innings.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not executing my pitches right now, and when I'm making
mistakes guys on the other side of the field are making the most of
them," Mulholland said.</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland had good results in spring training when he compiled a
2.96 ERA in 241/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   But he gave up eight runs and seven hits in two innings of a 12-0
loss to the San Francisco Giants on April 3, then surrendered five
runs and four hits in 22/3 innings against the Padres on April 13
after Kevin Brown left the game because of an arm injury.</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland looked better during two scoreless innings of a 6-4
loss at Colorado last Tuesday, but he wasted no time getting into
trouble Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland came on in relief of Andy Ashby in the seventh inning
with the Dodgers trailing, 2-0. Ramon Vazquez, the first batter he
faced, laid down a bunt that Mulholland fielded before throwing the
ball past Eric Karros at first base for an error.</TE>
<TE>   Trenidad Hubbard, pinch-hitting for Ryan Klesko, launched a home
run over the left-field fence and Phil Nevin followed with a homer
into the right-field pavilion for a 5-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brown will not accompany the team on its six-game trip to
Pittsburgh and Chicago as he continues to recover from torn scar
tissue in his right elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who was put on the 15-day disabled list Saturday, will play
light catch today at Dodger Stadium, Manager Jim Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   He is scheduled to throw in the bullpen Tuesday, Thursday and
Saturday under the supervision of Dave Wallace, the team's vice
president of baseball operations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Guillermo Mota, brought up from triple-A Las Vegas to fill Brown's
roster spot, struck out two and walked one in one inning in his first
appearance for the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   Mota was acquired from the Montreal Expos on March 23 in a
four-player trade that sent pitcher Matt Herges to Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Padre Manager Bruce Bochy was ejected by plate umpire Mike Winters
in the first inning after Nevin was thrown out trying to score on a
two-out single to right field by Ray Lankford.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger catcher Chad Kreuter moved to the right of home plate to
catch Shawn Green's throw from the outfield and dove to apply a tag.</TE>
<TE>   Replays appeared to show that Nevin beat the tag.</TE>
<TE>   Bochy retired to the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "This game gets frustrating, we thought he was safe," Bochy said,
"but it gave me a chance to listen to Vin Scully."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger reliever Jesse Orosco, who turned 45 Sunday, did not pitch
but was planning to celebrate with his family at Disneyland after the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "My kids told me that's where they want to take me," Orosco said.</TE>
<TE>   "My daughter said she's going to go on Space Mountain and the
Matterhorn."</TE>
<TE>   Will Orosco join her?</TE>
<TE>   "We'll see how it goes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nevin reached 100 home runs for the Padres faster than any player
in club history.</TE>
<TE>   Nevin achieved the feat in 439 games, eclipsing Ken Caminiti, who
did it in 468 games.</TE>

<HD>Smith Is Ducks' Top Candidate</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Sources say Anaheim is pursuing the former Ranger
GM to replace Gauthier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mighty Duck officials have discussed the team's general manager
position with former New York Ranger general manager Neil Smith,
sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The team will not consider promoting Coach Bryan Murray to replace
Pierre Gauthier, who was fired on Friday, sources said. A general
manager may be hired within days.</LD>
<LD>   Smith has emerged as the leading candidate. He has been a
part-time consultant for the Ducks the last two seasons and also has
spent time as a television commentator for ESPN. He has not run a
team since being fired by the Rangers late in the 1999-2000 season.</LD>
<TE>   Reached at his home in New York, Smith declined to comment on
whether he has been approached, but said he is interested in the job.</TE>
<TE>   Smith began his hockey career as a part-time scout for the New
York Islanders in the early 1980s. He spent 11 seasons as the
president and general manager of the Rangers and produced one Stanley
Cup championship in 1994, ending the team's 54-season drought.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks have made the playoffs only twice in their nine-year
history. They finished 13th last season, 25 points out of a playoff
spot.</TE>
<TE>   The new general manager will have a busy off-season, including
re-signing star winger Paul Kariya, who earned $10 million last
season. Improving the offense--the Ducks scored the second-fewest
goals in the NHL--also is high on the list, either through free
agency or trades.</TE>
<TE>   Duck officials also are close to hiring a senior vice president to
handle the business side of the operation.</TE>
<TE>   Among the leading candidates is Dean Jordan, who formerly ran the
Entertainment and Sports Arena for the Carolina Hurricanes. Tim Ryan,
the general manager of the Arrowhead Pond, also is being considered.</TE>

<KH>PORTLAND VS. LAKERS</KH>
<HD>GAME 1 REPORT</HD>
<DH>CHARTING THE LEAD: A look at the Lakers' lead or deficit by
the minute</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FIRST QUARTER</LD>
<LD>   Highlight reel: Chick's high above the sideline. Jack's courtside.
Shaq's on the floor. Kobe too. The Lakers and Trail Blazers are
present and accounted for. Fans are revved up, putting together a
decent "Let's go, Lakers" chant before the opening tip. Welcome to
Game 1 of the Lakers' three-peat attempt. The Trail Blazers had other
ideas, running off to an 18-9 lead.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: The Lakers had no answer for power forward
Rasheed Wallace. Early on, he hit from the outside and made the
Lakers come and get him on the perimeter.</LD>
<TE>   Winning number: Nine points, the largest Trail Blazer lead.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: Portland's nine-for-24 shooting (37.5%).</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Kobe Bryant 12, Shaquille O'Neal 4; Trail
Blazers--Wallace 10, Bonzi Wells 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Rick Fox 4; Trail Blazers--Wallace 5.</TE>
<TE>   SECOND QUARTER</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel:Bryant's inexcusable eight-second violation for
failing to get the ball over midcourt in the final moments of the
half pretty much summed up the play in the first 24 minutes. The
Lakers took their first lead, 32-31, on reserve Devean George's
three-point basket.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Robert Horry's pain threshold. He seemed to
be moving well enough after playing only three minutes in the
regular-season finale Wednesday because of bleeding beneath an
abdominal muscle.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: A two-point deficit for Portland was probably
better than the Trail Blazers had any right to expect given their
34.8% shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: Zero, the number of points the Lakers got from
Samaki Walker and Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 10; Trail Blazers--Derek Anderson
8, Wallace 5.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal, George 3; Trail
Blazers--Scottie Pippen, Dale Davis, Shawn Kemp 3.</TE>
<TE>   THIRD QUARTER</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Bryant went to the free-throw line early in the
quarter and made two. O'Neal dunked, was fouled and made one. Bryant
made two more free throws. In three possessions, three Trail
Blazers--Pippen, Wells and Davis--picked up their third fouls. It
wasn't inspiring stuff, but it took the Lakers from a two-point lead
to a 59-50 advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: No Laker seemed interested in guarding
Anderson, who had six of the Trail Blazers' final seven points in the
quarter, giving them hope that a upset was still possible.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: The Lakers' 16-8 run to open the quarter was the
antidote to their first-half blahs.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: By quarter's end, Davis had four fouls and Pippen
and Wells three apiece, a bad omen for the fourth for Portland.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 10, O'Neal 5; Trail
Blazers--Anderson 6, Ruben Patterson 5.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Bryant, Horry, O'Neal 3; Trail
Blazers--Wallace, Wells 2.</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH QUARTER</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: With the Trail Blazers still within striking
distance, Bryant leaped to block Patterson's short-range jumper. A
whistle sounded and a sellout crowd of 18,997 hushed, then roared
when it was ruled to be a jump ball. Patterson fancies himself as a
Bryant-stopper and he played credible defense on him in the past. But
Bryant's defensive gem and Pippen's subsequent miss on a
three-pointer after Patterson won the tip maintained an 89-82 Laker
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Wallace was forced to guard O'Neal after
Davis picked up his fifth foul with 8:11 remaining. Wallace made only
one basket, a three-pointer, the rest of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: Although he made only 10 of 28 shots, Bryant was
12 for 13 at the line.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: The Trail Blazers missed 52 of 82 shots.</TE>

<LD>You picked a funny time to grow up, Blazermaniacs.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike the last meeting between these teams, no Portland Trail
Blazer incurred a technical foul (as Bonzi Wells and Scottie Pippen
had), or a flagrant foul (Shawn Kemp), or was ejected (Pippen) or
kicked a chair on the sideline (Rasheed Wallace), causing a teammate
sitting on the bench (Steve Kerr) to duck.</LD>
<LD>   Also, unlike the last meeting, the Trail Blazers lost.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately for the Trail Blazers, Sunday's game was more like a
walk in the park than that wild and crazy afternoon in Portland a
week earlier when they wiped out a 10-point deficit in the fourth
quarter and an eight-point deficit in overtime, while holding
bug-eyed discussions with the referees, pitching fits and ducking the
Bill Walton bobblehead dolls their fans were throwing.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, they were perfect gentlemen, playing at the Lakers' tempo,
waltz time, enabling the Lakers to set up their offense, sort through
their options and, when sufficiently threatened, throw the ball in to
Shaquille O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   This is a minuet the Trail Blazers will have to stop--"That would
help," said Derek Anderson--or it's going to be another long
off-season in Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't the breakout game Lakerdom has been living for. If
pregame activity and expectation were multiplied, when the game
started, there was still none of the old swagger, no electricity in
the arena, none of the contagious confidence of last spring, no
balance (O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Derek Fisher scored 81 of the
Lakers' 95 points) and no domination. The Trail Blazers, who weren't
putting on a clinic, were still within 68-67 early in the fourth
quarter and 87-82 with 4:33 left.</TE>
<TE>   But even if the Lakers look vulnerable, they aren't just going to
take a hike. Someone will have to be good enough to beat them and the
Trail Blazers weren't Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "You can look at it as a blown opportunity, I think," said
erstwhile center Dale Davis, "'cause I thought the table was set
perfect for us."</TE>
<TE>   Well, maybe not perfect.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are still twice-defending champions, favored to make it
three. The Trail Blazers were red hot from January to March, when
several NBA people called them the best team in the league, but their
momentum ebbed, and their tempers heated up, in a 6-6 finish, sinking
their hopes of catching No. 5 Minnesota and ducking the Lakers in the
first round, their unannounced but well-known game plan.</TE>
<TE>   Despite beating the Lakers a week ago, this is a nightmare matchup
for the Trail Blazers, who were in enough trouble when they had
7-foot, 300-pound Arvydas Sabonis. Now, with Sabonis in Lithuania,
ignoring all invitations to come out of retirement, they have to line
up the reedy Davis, who fouled out in 24 minutes, on O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, the Trail Blazer coach, Maurice Cheeks, was a 76er
assistant on Larry Brown's staff, watching O'Neal flatten Dikembe
Mutombo and puncture the 76ers' dream.</TE>
<TE>   The difference now is the Trail Blazers have no one as big as
Mutombo.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq was unstoppable then," said Cheeks before the game, "and
he's probably still unstoppable now....</TE>
<TE>   "What we have to do is try and defend them up the court, not make
it so easy for them to grab the ball, swing it around the perimeter
and post the ball to him. 'Cause that way, the guy guarding Shaq has
no chance at all.</TE>
<TE>   "Because if [O'Neal] is just getting low-post position, he can
just turn around, dunk the ball, do whatever he wants to do."</TE>
<TE>   Yup, that's about what happened.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal didn't actually get the ball that often, what with Bryant
taking 28 shots, perhaps too intent on laying waste to Reuben
Patterson, his self-anointed nemesis, to notice he was on his way to
missing 18 of them.</TE>
<TE>   However, Bryant scored 34 points, Shaq had 25 and the Trail
Blazers shot 36.6%, which isn't going to win you many games against
the champions on their floor.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a good game," said Patterson of Bryant. "I give him
credit....</TE>
<TE>   "He had a good game. I mean, when you get calls, ain't nothing you
can do about that. He shot a lot of free throws. That was half of his
points. We got to the basket, get fouled, they don't call it for us,
so ... I don't know what it is. I mean, everybody watched the game,
so ... "</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers, who reckon they made a mistake last spring,
staying here for the entire four-day respite between Games 1 and 2 in
the NBA's new e-x-t-e-n-d-e-d first-round format, and not just
because their significant others were turned loose on Rodeo Drive,
flew home Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   They'll return Wednesday, hoping to play better Thursday night,
when they'd be well advised to show up with their attitudes, if not
their fangs.</TE>

<KH>GAME 3 TONIGHT Colorado at Kings</KH>
<HD>Hoping to Taste the Past</HD>
<DH>Hockey: A year ago, the Kings lost two games before
stunning Detroit, but much has changed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is where it started a year ago. This is where the Kings shed a
14-game playoff losing streak, fashioned an improbable comeback and
scripted one of the most unforgettable chapters in a 35-year history
rich in disappointment.</LD>
<LD>   Down but not out after losing the first two games of a Stanley Cup
playoff series against the Detroit Red Wings, they produced a tense,
2-1 Game 3 victory at Staples Center and parlayed it into a stunning
first-round upset, winning the final four games of the Western
Conference quarterfinal matchup.</LD>
<LD>   Other than the obvious, however, the Kings see little similarity
between the situation they faced then and their plight today,
trailing the Colorado Avalanche, 2-0, going into Game 3 tonight at
Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   In their first two games against the Red Wings last April, they
say, they were dreadful, uninvolved and uninspired.</TE>
<TE>   Against the Avalanche, they have been much more competitive.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year," Coach Andy Murray said Sunday, "I would have said
after [the first two games], 'The great hope [lies] in the fact that
we haven't started to play.' This year, I'll say there's great hope
because we only have to fine-tune things....</TE>
<TE>   "This year, you can hang your hat on effort, enthusiasm and
passion and you can recognize that there are only a few things you
have to adjust to allow your team to be more successful."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Kings face long odds against the Avalanche, defending
Stanley Cup champion and brimming with confidence and added firepower
since the return of Peter Forsberg, who had five points in the
Avalanche's 4-3 and 5-3 victories.</TE>
<TE>   Dating to 1939, when the NHL introduced the format, teams that
have won the first two games of best-of-seven playoff series have
gone on to win the series nearly 87% of the time.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche is 9-0 in this situation, never needing more than
six games to close out the series, winning all but three in four or
five.</TE>
<TE>   Before last season, the Kings were 0-8 in playoff series after
losing the first two games and had been swept in five, among them
four in a row.</TE>
<TE>   What's past, however, is of little concern to these Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really want to look back at last year," captain Mattias
Norstrom said. "What happened there, it happened last year. The thing
we've done this year that I felt we didn't do against Detroit, we've
played some good hockey. Not good enough to win but ... we've done
some good things."</TE>
<TE>   While scoring six goals against Avalanche goaltender Patrick Roy,
however, the Kings have given up nine against a team that struggled
to score all season, setting franchise records for fewest goals and
most times shut out.</TE>
<TE>   The fault, Murray said, does not all lie with the King defense.
Rather, he said, the Kings have played fast and loose with the puck,
resulting in turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to play tight defensively," he said. "I think in a
lot of cases [the breakdown] hasn't been the play when we don't have
the puck, which is your defensive emphasis. It's been what we've done
with the puck when we've had it offensively that has created
opportunities for them.</TE>
<TE>   "We are emphasizing defensive structure, but we've been stressed a
few times defensively because we've given the puck back to them.
There's a saying, 'When you're a good checker, don't give the puck
back to the other team just so you can prove it.' We've given them
the puck a few too many times."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the Kings stayed close, for whatever that's worth.</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, it gives them hope they can carry into Staples
Center, where they are 9-0-2 since March 2, when they lost to the
Columbus Blue Jackets, 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   For the next two games anyway--Game 4 is Tuesday night--they can
forget that their road winless streak reached eight games with the
two losses at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   "If we went in there and lost two games where we didn't get
nothing and we got dominated, we'd probably be more discouraged,"
center Jason Allison said. "But the way we played, we realize we're
right there. We can still win the series."</TE>
<TE>   It just won't be easy.</TE>
<TE>   No matter the circumstances, turnarounds such as the Kings'
against the Red Wings last season aren't often repeated.</TE>

<HD>More of the Same for Blake</HD>

<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If recent history holds true, former King and current Colorado
defenseman Rob Blake will hear more than his share of boos from Los
Angeles fans in tonight's Game 3 at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   It has happened every time Blake has played his former team on the
road and he doesn't expect King fans to let up now.</LD>
<LD>   "They are great fans. They supported me 100% when I was there,"
said Blake, who already has made his presence known in the series
with a team-high 15 hits and six blocked shots in the first two
games. "I don't expect it to be any different than what I've got in
the last year."</LD>
<TE>   The rough treatment he received from the Kings may have bothered
Blake at first, but not anymore. It helps that last year he went on
to win a Stanley Cup championship with Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand how loyal their fans are.... They are loyal to their
teams and they should be," Blake said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In giving up nine goals in the first two games of the series, the
Kings haven't fared too well with the play being so wide open. At
times, goaltender Felix Potvin (who has faced 71 shots in two games)
looks as if he's facing shots in a full-speed layup drill.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not been by design," defenseman Aaron Miller said. "It's
been because of mistakes of ours. We get guys caught down low and
then end up with a 3-on-2."</TE>
<TE>   Another problem for the Kings has been Colorado's ability to beat
Potvin once they get there. During the regular season, that wasn't
the case as Potvin gave up only 13 goals in four games.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado captain Joe Sakic said it's because the Avalanche know
how to beat the King goalie.</TE>
<TE>   "With Felix, we know he's really good covering the ice," Sakic
said. "So you're not going to beat him too often down low. So you
have to try and get your shots up on him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With a 2-0 lead, the Avalanche players are happy to play
consecutive games over the next two nights.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice because we don't have that day off and that's usually
your longest day when you're on the road," Sakic said.</TE>

<HD>Grizzlies, Hawks Courting West</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry West spoke this weekend with Memphis owner Michael Heisley
about running the Grizzlies' basketball operations.</LD>
<LD>   The former Laker executive has two immediate opportunities, with
the Grizzlies and Atlanta Hawks, should he choose to return full-time
to the game he left nearly two years ago because of health concerns,
and should those organizations make contract offers.</LD>
<LD>   He is said to be willing to consider only an optimal situation.</LD>
<TE>   West has had several conversations with Stan Kasten, president of
the Hawks.</TE>
<TE>   While there are believed to be other teams interested in hiring
West, the Grizzlies and Hawks have been aggressive in their pursuit,
and are expected to offer multi-year, multi-million-dollar contracts.</TE>
<TE>   A consultant for the Lakers since he resigned as vice president
for basketball operations, West attended Sunday's playoff game at
Staples Center, more of a habit for him in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant shed his signature pushed back afro for a more
conservative look, something he said he'd considered for months. He
cut his hair Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel a little quicker," he said. "I'm shorter, though."</TE>
<TE>   With Robert Horry hurting and Samaki Walker susceptible to foul
trouble, Coach Phil Jackson might have to give minutes to Slava
Medvedenko and Mark Madsen.</TE>
<TE>   Asked his comfort with that, he couldn't cut the questioner off
fast enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Not very comfortable," Jackson said. "If we have to use them, we
have to use them. But, Slava did not show well in the last game up in
Portland. He made three mistakes in the fourth quarter that cost us a
13-point lead. It went from 13 to seven in that period of time.</TE>
<TE>   "Mark is more of a defensive player. He can do some things, and we
used him in the first half [at aPortland] effectively. But, this is a
relatively inexperienced player."</TE>
<TE>   As is his custom in the playoffs, Jackson wore his newest
championship ring on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's ring celebrated the consecutive titles, with two Larry
O'Brien trophies made of white diamonds on a field of yellow
diamonds.</TE>
<TE>   He rarely wears them otherwise, because they are heavy and awkward
and gives him bone bruises when he shakes hands with people.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate them," he said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   His consecutive games streak ended earlier this season at 3,338,
but Chick Hearn on Sunday called his 430th consecutive playoff game
for the Lakers.... The Lakers have won 17 of their last 18 playoff
games, starting with Game 6 of the 2000 NBA Finals.</TE>

<LD>They played in seven other towns this weekend and returned to 14
other locker rooms with varying takes on reality, but the hard truth
on the occasion of another Laker victory was that the NBA playoffs
might not really start until the Lakers lose a game.</LD>
<LD>   Playing for their third consecutive championship and at the end of
another fitful regular season, the Lakers defeated the Portland Trail
Blazers, 95-87, Sunday afternoon at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Shaquille O'Neal scored a workmanlike 25 points, six in a 14-3 run
early in the fourth quarter that finished the Trail Blazers. Kobe
Bryant was a little flighty, but scored 34 points, 12 from the
free-throw line. Derek Fisher scored 12 points, six in the fourth
quarter.</LD>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers missed nearly two-thirds of their shots, in part
because Laker forward Robert Horry played 30 minutes, most of them
with grit against Rasheed Wallace. Horry was questionable for the
game because of an abdominal injury, but was agile and aggressive,
and is expected to play Thursday in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   And so Phil Jackson lurched into their locker room, picked up a
black marker and wrote the number "14" and drew a line under it, just
as he has after the first of 15 victories in their last two
championship seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a fine game," Jackson insisted, a fine game to have behind
them.</TE>
<TE>   They did not rout the moody Trail Blazers as they did last season
in the same place, at the same time, when all it took to force
surrender was a gentle nudge.</TE>
<TE>   But their lead in the best-of-five series is 1-0, and that's what
they came for, and that's why the playoffs are here first, and
everywhere else second, until defeat, even momentary defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we would have liked to have had the type of game to start
the playoff series with a 30-point blowout," said forward Rick Fox,
whose three-pointer pushed the Laker lead to 10 in the fourth-quarter
run. "This team has a lot of history with Portland. They're coming in
here and, as you've seen, have spoken a lot about how they feel they
can beat us and how they basically don't respect us. It's a matter of
going out and playing accordingly."</TE>
<TE>   Or well enough.</TE>
<TE>   "A win is a win," O'Neal said. "It doesn't matter how many points
you win by. A win is a win."</TE>
<TE>   They just won, with just enough effort, the kind of thing they
train for in their first six months, when they measure their foe
first and play next.</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers sent an extra man or two at O'Neal at every
entry pass, and that bogged the Laker offense well into the second
half. That's why Bryant took seven three-pointers, as many as he'd
taken in a game this season, and that's why O'Neal took only eight
first-half shots.</TE>
<TE>   "It took a while for us to get adjusted to what we had to do,"
Bryant said, "to get in the rhythm and know how to get them under
control somewhat."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal would hear nothing of the Trail Blazer tactics.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not really worried about what they're trying to do," he said.
"We just have to keep our composure, not get involved with the antics
they try to put us through, and keep playing."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace scored 25 points and took 14 rebounds and guard Derek
Anderson scored 22 points in 24 minutes. It was Anderson whom the San
Antonio Spurs had hoped would help them out of a two-games-to-none
hole in the Western Conference finals last season. He returned from a
separated shoulder for the last two games and scored four points in
41 minutes, and the Lakers went off to their repeat title.</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers said they wasted a decent chance to unnerve the
Lakers when they were one point behind with 11 minutes to play. The
Trail Blazers had won a similarly played game in two overtimes a week
earlier in Portland, coming back from a 13-point deficit in
regulation, and from eight points in the first overtime.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the Trail Blazers missed late shots and failed to
gather late rebounds. As usual, the postseason Lakers proved a bit
tougher than their regular-season counterparts. They made 10 of 18
fourth-quarter field-goal attempts, three of five by Bryant, who for
the game missed 18 of 28 shots.</TE>
<TE>   "Every little thing about their game stepped up in the second
half," Trail Blazer Coach Maurice Cheeks said. "The second half is
indicative of the way this team wins championships."</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth quarter, Horry ran the floor with his hand over his
stomach, but later said he only winced because Ruben Patterson
elbowed him there, presumably unintentionally.</TE>
<TE>   He hated the way he played, but was satisfied with his physical
condition.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt good," he said. "I got a little fatigued there from not
playing in so long, but I felt good and went out there and did some
things."</TE>

<HD>Coleman Nearly Calls It a Day Before Raiders Give Him a
Call</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINA TELLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kenyon Coleman had waited all his football-playing life for this day.
But nearly three hours into the broadcast of the second day of the
2002 NFL draft, the UCLA defensive end still had not been selected,
so he turned off the TV. He needed a break.</LD>
<LD>   Minutes later his phone rang. It was an Oakland Raider
representative, who told Coleman the team had selected him in the
fifth round (No. 147 overall).</LD>
<LD>   "It was a really nice surprise to get picked up by them," Coleman
said. "When I went to combines, Oakland didn't really talk to me, but
I really like the way things turned out. I'm just ready to go in and
give it my best."</LD>
<TE>   Coleman, a fifth-year senior, had been projected as a third or
fourth-round selection after leading UCLA with 81/2 sacks. He had
returned from a serious knee injury that had sidelined him for most
of the 2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   The defensive line is a concern for the Raiders, who ranked 24th
against the run and were further weakened by the substance
abuse-related suspension for the 2002 regular season of defensive
tackle Darrell Russell--a former USC player and the No. 2 overall
pick in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Said Raider Coach Bill Callahan of the 6-foot-5, 285-pound
Coleman:</TE>
<TE>   "He's strong, explosive and has completeness in his game. [He] can
play end on a normal down situation and [there's a] possibility of
moving inside to provide pass rush in the third-down situation."</TE>
<TE>   Three of Coleman's teammates, linebacker Robert Thomas, running
back DeShaun Foster and safety Marques Anderson were selected
Saturday. Thomas was a first-round selection (No. 31) by St. Louis,
Foster was taken three picks later by Carolina and Anderson went to
Green Bay in the third round (No. 92).</TE>
<TE>   Two other Bruins, tight end Bryan Fletcher and long snapper Jeff
Grau, were selected Sunday. Fletcher, who had 11 catches for 189
yards and a touchdown last season, was taken by Chicago in the sixth
round (No. 210) and Grau was a seventh-round pick (No. 230) by
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Cornerback Chris Cash became the second USC player taken in the
draft, going to Detroit in the sixth round (No. 175). Cash had 47
tackles and two interceptions before suffering a broken leg in the
Trojans' ninth game. Another USC cornerback, Kris Richard, was
selected Saturday in the third round (No. 85) by Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Other players from Southern California who were selected Sunday:</TE>
<TE>   * Linebacker Kevin Bentley (fourth round, No. 101 by Cleveland out
of Northwestern and Montclair High).</TE>
<TE>   * Defensive tackle Alan Harper (fourth round, No. 121 by the New
York Jets out of Fresno State and Fontana High).</TE>
<TE>   * Safety Sam Brandon (fourth round, No. 131 by Denver out of
Nevada Las Vegas and Riverside North High).</TE>
<TE>   * Wide receiver Terry Charles (fifth round, No. 142 by San Diego
out of Portland State and Long Beach Wilson High).</TE>
<TE>   * Linebacker Scott Fujita (fifth round, No. 143 by Kansas City out
of California and Oxnard Rio Mesa High).</TE>
<TE>   * Running back Larry Ned (sixth round, No. 197 by Oakland out of
San Diego State and Moreno Valley Rancho Verde).</TE>
<TE>   * Running back Brian Allen (sixth round, No. 204 by Indianapolis
out of Stanford and La Verne Damien High.</TE>
<TE>   * Safety Steve Smith (seventh round, No. 246 by Jacksonville out
of Oregon and San Pedro High).</TE>

<HD>Earnhardt Sees Red Before Talladega Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dale Earnhardt Jr. was relaxed and confident as he raced toward a
dominating victory Sunday in the Winston Cup Aaron's 499 at Talladega
(Ala.) Superspeedway.</LD>
<LD>   It was when NASCAR waved the red flag, pausing the action six laps
from the end, that the worrying began.</LD>
<LD>   "Sitting on the back straightaway, I was real nervous because I've
led a lot of races like that and not won," Earnhardt said.</LD>
<TE>   "I knew it wasn't over. It gets really crazy out there at the end
because everybody does anything and everything to win."</TE>
<TE>   Earnhardt, who managed to avoid a 24-car wreck earlier in the
race, easily kept his lead on the restart and held off teammate
Michael Waltrip over the last five laps for his second consecutive
victory on the 2.66-mile oval.</TE>
<TE>   Earnhardt, like his late father, has become a master of the
superspeedways, racing off to his third victory in the last four
restrictor-plate races and leading 133 of 188 laps.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is always the specter of a multicar crash in the
races on NASCAR's big tracks.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I didn't want to be any farther back than fifth because I
knew it was going to happen," Earnhardt said, referring to crash that
came on Lap 164.</TE>
<TE>   "With the rules package, we're gouging and getting into the sides
of each other just because it's so hard to pass, and I didn't want
any part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Martin, involved in the big wreck, brought out the third and
final caution flag of the day when his battered car stalled in the
grass on the back straightaway eight laps from the finish.</TE>
<TE>   With oil dumped on parts of the track, NASCAR--as it did in the
season-opening Daytona 500--brought out the red flag and stopped the
cars on the backstretch on Lap 183 to give the safety crews time to
clean the track and allow the race to finish under green.</TE>
<TE>   The cars were restarted after a delay of 15 minutes 29 seconds
and, after the green waved with four laps to go, the 27-year-old
Earnhardt, whose father won 10 times on this track, fought off the
challenge from his Dale Earnhardt Inc. teammate.</TE>
<TE>   Although he's a winner again, Scott Sharp has some unfinished
business.</TE>
<TE>   After prevailing in a battle of strategies when pole-sitter Gil de
Ferran ran out of fuel on the final lap of the IRL Firestone 225 at
Nazareth, Pa., Sharp is heading for the Indianapolis 500.</TE>
<TE>   He'll be returning to the scene of one of the greatest
embarrassments in auto racing history. As the pole-sitter last year,
he spun out on the first turn. But Sharp insists there are no
lingering effects.</TE>
<TE>   "Just getting back on the track took care of that," he said.
"That's behind me now."</TE>
<TE>   And that's where De Ferran finished for lack of a splash of fuel.</TE>
<TE>   De Ferran had stopped on the 95th of 225 laps in the inaugural IRL
race at Nazareth Speedway and was trying to nurse his car to the end.</TE>

<HD>Bell Rises Above Marquee</HD>
<DH>Mt. SAC Relays: Outshining better-known stars, he sets
stadium mark with year's best triple jump.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He lacks the name recognition of Marion Jones, Adam Nelson, J.J.
Johnson, Angela Williams, Miesha McKelvy and Amy Acuff in U.S. track
and field circles.</LD>
<LD>   But of all the athletes who won events in the 44th Mount San
Antonio College Relays at Walnut on Sunday, triple jumper Kenta
(pronounced KEN-tay) Bell was the only one to post the best outdoor
mark in the world this year and set a stadium record.</LD>
<LD>   Jones, perhaps the best-known track and field athlete in the
world, won the women's 400 meters in 50.46 seconds, the fastest time
in the world this year.</LD>
<TE>   Nelson, the silver medalist in the men's shotput in the World
Championships last year, defeated three-time world champion John
Godina with a put of 70 feet 3 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, the big find on the world sprint scene last year, won the
men's 100 in 9.95, best of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Women posting world-leading marks were: Williams with 11:06 in the
100, McKelvy with 12.86 in the 100 high hurdles and Acuff with 6-43/4
in the high jump.</TE>
<TE>   Bell, 25, who bounded a world-leading 57 feet 101/4 inches on his
sixth and final effort in the men's triple jump, broke the stadium
record of 55-91/4 set by Willie Banks in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, a 55-91/4 triple jump isn't in the same statistical class
as some of the other stadium records such as 9.86 in the men's 100 or
73-103/4 in the men's shotput. But it was hard to top Bell's effort
for drama or surprise as it vaulted him from fourth to first place
and crushed his previous best of 56-63/4 set in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hoping to jump well today," said Bell, who has never been
on a U.S. national team. "I thought I was capable of jumping 57 or
56-10. But [57-101/4] was a shock."</TE>
<TE>   Bell, who placed eighth in the 1999 NCAA championships as a senior
at Northwestern State Louisiana, was in second place after the first
four rounds with a best of 55-41/4. But he dropped to third when
LeVar Anderson jumped 55-51/2 in the fifth round to move into second
and slipped to fourth in the sixth round when Julien Kapak of USC
bounded 55-81/2 to temporarily take the lead before Anderson followed
that with a 55-101/4 effort.</TE>
<TE>   "That definitely got the adrenaline flowing," Bell said. "I have
to give credit to my competitors because I didn't want to lose."</TE>
<TE>   With many spectators clapping in unison to encourage him, Bell
sprinted down the runway, hit the takeoff board and produced the best
jump by an American since Kenny Harrison set the U.S. record of
59-41/4 in winning at the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "The triple jump has been down [in the U.S.]," said Bell, who
moved to fifth on the all-time national performer list with his
effort. "In my mind, I feel like we've let [athletes like Kenny
Harrison] down because we haven't been doing what we're capable of
doing. But hopefully, this is the beginning of something "</TE>
<TE>   Jones, the world's top-ranked women's 100 and 200 sprinter for the
previous five years, won the 400 for the fourth time in the last five
years at Mt. SAC after placing first in a 300 last year. Her 50.46
clocking was well off her career-best and stadium-record time of
49.59 set in 2000. "I'd love to be talking about how I ran 48
seconds, 49 seconds," said Jones, competing in her first race of the
year. "So in that way, I'm a little disappointed ... I was really
hoping for a personal best today."</TE>
<TE>   Jones had a three- or four-meter lead when she came through the
first 200 in 23.7. But she slowed in the final 50 while finishing
more than a second ahead of runner-up LaDonna Antoine.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson got off to a solid start in the 100 before powering away
in the final 35 meters. "It felt pretty good," said Johnson, who ran
with a sore ankle that has bothered him for two to three weeks. "I
haven't been able to do much block work. So my start needs some work,
but I was happy with the way I ran."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Rawlinson of Britain won the men's 400 intermediate hurdles
in 48.49 to break the meet record of 48.50 set by Edwin Moses in
1979.</TE>

<LD>Yao Ming, a 7-foot-5 center from China, has been cleared to enter the
NBA draft.</LD>
<LD>   His current club, the Shanghai Sharks, made the announcement after
Yao helped it win its first Chinese Basketball Assn. championship
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Yao has been projected as an NBA lottery pick, possibly No. 1
overall.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There's a chance David Robinson can play today in Game 2 of San
Antonio's first-round series against the Seattle SuperSonics, but the
Spurs are shaping a game plan that doesn't depend on the 7-foot-1
center.</TE>
<TE>   In Saturday's series opener, Robinson left after only seven
minutes when his sore back tightened up. Malik Rose replaced him in a
lopsided victory.</TE>
<TE>   Spur Coach Gregg Popovich said Robinson's status would be a
game-time decision.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Far removed from the spotlight of the NBA, Hall of Famer Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar made his professional head coaching debut Sunday night
Dodge City, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   "No jitters, no jitters at all," said Abdul-Jabbar, the NBA's
career scoring leader and an 18-time All-Star who received a standing
ovation before his Oklahoma Storm lost, 98-97, to the Dodge City
Legend in a United States Basketball League game.</TE>
<TE>   With the 2,300-seat Dodge City Civic Center sold out, fans lined
up hours for standing-room-only tickets. The announced attendance was
2,659, breaking the previous Civic Center basketball record of 2,514.</TE>

<HD>Celtics Spoil the Return of Iverson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Boston Celtics' return to the playoffs was much better than Allen
Iverson's.</LD>
<LD>   The Celtics won their first postseason game since 1995, beating
Iverson's Philadelphia 76ers, 92-82, Sunday in the opener of their
best-of-five Eastern Conference series as last season's league most
valuable player missed 11 of 15 field-goal attempts at Boston.</LD>
<LD>   Iverson missed the 76ers' final 14 games of the regular season
after breaking his left hand, which was heavily bandaged Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Paul Pierce led the way for Boston with 31 points, 11 rebounds,
four steals and three blocked shots.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson, who led the league in scoring average at 31.4 points,
said his hand felt fine. And he did lead the 76ers with 20 points.
But his only field goals came in the first quarter, when he had 15
points, and he missed his last nine shots.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just playing like I usually play. I didn't think a whole
bunch about" the hand, he said. "I'm cool. I can run forever."</TE>
<TE>   Game 2 is Thursday night at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "You're anxious to get back out on the court, even though we won,
just to get back in that atmosphere," Pierce said. "I could do this
every day."</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics led throughout the last three quarters and by double
figures for the last 18 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't playing with any organization at all," Philadelphia
Coach Larry Brown said. "The Celtics were so far superior to us in
terms of preparation and execution, it wasn't even close."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 85, Toronto 63--The Pistons and Raptors got off to an ugly
start. The game didn't get much prettier, although the Pistons
finished strong.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Wallace had 19 points, 20 rebounds, three blocked shots and
three steals as Detroit won the opening game in the series at Auburn
Hills, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   The Pistons and Raptors combined for only 25 points in the first
quarter as Detroit led, 16-9, tying the NBA playoff record for fewest
combined points in a first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "We struggled early on the offensive end, but our defense carried
us through like it has all season," Wallace said.</TE>
<TE>   The Raptors managed only 11 points in the third quarter and fell
behind by as many as 29. Toronto shot only 29.9% and had its lowest
point total in three postseason appearances.</TE>
<TE>   "We were in a fog," Toronto Coach Lenny Wilkens said. "The best
part is, it's a five-game series. We'll be ready, believe me."</TE>
<TE>   Game 2 is Wednesday at Auburn Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Stackhouse led Detroit in scoring with 20 points. Antonio
Davis led the Raptors with 15 points.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 101, Minnesota 94--No matter how carefree and quirky the
Mavericks play on offense, they usually don't rely on halfcourt shots
and banked-in three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   They did this time.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Nash sank a 40-footer as the third quarter ended, then Raef
LaFrentz opened the fourth with a kiss off the glass from the top of
the key, sparking a 12-0 run that carried the Mavericks at Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   It also put the Timberwolves into an 0-1 hole in a best-of-five
series for the sixth consecutive postseason. Minnesota has yet to dig
out of one, getting eliminated in the first round five consecutive
years.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a huge momentum swing," Kevin Garnett, who had 19 points,
21 rebounds and six assists for the Timberwolves, said of the shots
by Nash and LaFrentz.</TE>
<TE>   '' Dirk Nowitzki led Dallas with 30 points and 15 rebounds.
Chauncey Billups led the Timberwolves with 25 points and nine
assists.</TE>
<TE>   The stat sheet showed the game could have gone Minnesota's way.
The Timberwolves had 19 more rebounds, outscored the Mavericks, 26-2,
on second-chance points and had a 24-6 edge on fastbreak points.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at that and it looks like we won," Billups said. "But
they made some big shots."</TE>

<HD>Leonard Survives Errors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Justin Leonard survived some anxious moments Sunday to win the
WorldCom Classic at Hilton Head Island, S.C.</LD>
<LD>   He closed with a two-over-par 73 for a 14-under 270 total, a
stroke ahead of Heath Slocum and two in front of Phil Mickelson.
Slocum shot a 70 and Mickelson a 71.</LD>
<LD>   But it wouldn't be Harbour Town Golf Links for Leonard--he had
never finished higher than 30th in six appearances-- without some
difficulty.</LD>
<TE>   Leonard's fortunes appeared to have changed for good as he set a
54-hole scoring record with rounds of 67, 64 and 66.</TE>
<TE>   However, the birdies that were so plentiful through Saturday would
not come in the final round, and Leonard struggled to win his seventh
PGA Tour title.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard ricocheted an approach off the railroad ties that front
the bunker at the 13th hole for a bogey, dropping him into a tie with
Slocum at 15 under. Then Leonard, known for making a 45-foot putt to
clinch the 1999 Ryder Cup for the United States, missed a two-footer
for par on the next hole to give Slocum a lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I was mad at myself when I missed that putt," Leonard said.</TE>
<TE>   This time, though, it was Slocum, a 28-year-old who won three
Buy.com Tour events last season, who struggled.</TE>
<TE>   His sand shot to the 16th hole rolled about 40 feet past the pin.
His par try was seven feet short and he missed the putt coming back
to fall to 13 under and a shot behind.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cristie Kerr won the Longs Drugs Challenge for her first LPGA Tour
title, taking advantage of Hee-Won Han's final-hole bogey.</TE>
<TE>   Kerr, in her sixth full season on the tour at age 24, squandered a
five-stroke lead before parring the 18th hole for a three-over 75 and
a one-stroke victory over Han, who shot a 70. She bogeyed the 18th
hole after hooking her tee shot into the glove compartment of a golf
cart.</TE>
<TE>   Kerr finished with an eight-under 280 on the demanding Twelve
Bridges course at Lincoln, Calif. She earned $135,000 to move into
second place on the money list with $295,606. Annika Sorenstam, who
did not play in the tournament, tops the list with $563,330.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Britain and Ireland defeated Europe, 141/2 to 111/2, to win the
Seve Trophy at Newtownmountkennedy, Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   Europe had a 51/2 to 41/2 edge in the 10 singles matches on the
third day of the Ryder Cup-style event, but Britain and Ireland
already had built a 10-6 lead. European captain Seve Ballesteros, who
organized the event, beat Britain and Ireland captain Colin
Montgomerie, 1 up in the opening match.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   No. 58-ranked Iva Majoli became the lowest-ranked player to win a
top-tier tournament when she defeated Patty Schnyder, 7-6 (5), 6-4,
for the championship of the Family Circle Cup at Charlestown, S.C.,
her first singles title since the 1997 French Open.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Juan Carlos Ferrero beat Carlos Moya, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4, to win the
Monte Carlo Masters, the first major clay-court tournament of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrero closed out the match when Moya sent his last service
return wide.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Meredith Beard scored in the 82nd minute to give the Washington
Freedom a 2-1 victory over defending WUSA champion San Jose at
Washington. Both teams are 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ice Dogs were eliminated from the West Coast Hockey League
playoffs with a 5-1 loss to the Fresno Falcons in the decisive fifth
game of their first-round playoff series in Long Beach.</TE>

<HD>Here's the Rough Draft Before the Final Copy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are two ways of looking at every NFL draft pick. Here's a
sampling of some of the more prominent picks:</LD>
<LD>   The pick: Fresno State quarterback David Carr (No. 1 overall by
Houston)</LD>
<LD>   The justification: The Texans plan to build their franchise around
this sidearm slinger who threw for 4,299 yards and 42 touchdowns last
season.</LD>
<TE>   Who's happy: Carr's church, assuming this devout Christian plans
to contribute 10% of his $46-million contract.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not happy: Carr, if the Texans spend too much time trying to
modify his three-quarters throwing motion and footwork.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: North Carolina defensive end Julius Peppers (No. 2 by
Carolina)</TE>
<TE>   The justification: Peppers has a reputation for not making an
effort on some plays, but is difficult to block when he goes full
speed. He had a combined 241/2 sacks the last two seasons and is
joining a team for which the single-season sack record by a lineman
is 81/2.</TE>
<TE>   Who's happy: The Panthers, who are hoping the hometown pick helps
boost sagging attendance.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not happy:  North Carolina basketball Coach Matt Doherty,
who could have used Peppers in a season that turned into an 8-20
nightmare. Peppers, who shot 67% as a valuable sophomore reserve,
concentrated on football to improve his NFL draft status.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Oregon quarterback Joey Harrington (No. 3 by Detroit)</TE>
<TE>   The justification: The Lions, who were 2-14 last season, had all
sorts of other needs yet made getting a high-profile quarterback
their No. 1 priority.</TE>
<TE>   Who's happy: Ford Motor Company, which now has the inside track on
landing Harrington as a celebrity sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not happy: Mike McMahon, the Lions' No. 5 pick last year and
a late-season starter who thought he was going to be the Lions'
quarterback of the future.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Texas tackle Mike Williams (No. 4 by Buffalo)</TE>
<TE>   The justification: The 6-foot-5, 375-pound Williams will help
bolster Buffalo's 22nd-ranked ground game and can help protect
just-acquired quarterback Drew Bledsoe.</TE>
<TE>   Who's happy: Big &amp; Tall stores of the greater Buffalo area.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not happy: Any of the poor souls behind Williams in the
fast-food drive-thru.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Oklahoma safety Roy Williams (No. 8 by Dallas)</TE>
<TE>   The justification: Williams was a unanimous All-American, the Big
12 Conference defensive player of the year, and won the Bronko
Nagurski and Jim Thorpe awards as the nation's best defensive player
and defensive back last season.</TE>
<TE>   Who's happy: The Cowboys, whose secondary gets a dramatic
facelift.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not happy: Cowboy owner Jerry Jones, who doesn't appreciate
that analogy.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Arizona State tackle Levi Jones (No. 10 by Cincinnati)</TE>
<TE>   The justification: Jones is a smart kid who had an academic
scholarship to Arizona State and, as a freshman, joined the football
team as a walk-on. He played his way into the starting lineup and
eventually was second-team All-Pacific 10 Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Who's happy: All those teams who are used to seeing Cincinnati
make dumb decisions and head-scratching picks.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not happy: The Baltimore Ravens, who liked Jones and by all
rights should have been able to get him 14 picks later.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Syracuse defensive end Dwight Freeney (No. 11 by
Indianapolis)</TE>
<TE>   The justification: Freeney is light at 265 pounds, but has
blistering speed for a defensive lineman. Although he went much
higher than just about every draft guru projected, he fits nicely
into Tony Dungy's defensive scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Who's happy: The Colts, whose pass rush was nonexistent when Chad
Bratzke was double-teamed last season.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not happy: This writer. Perhaps because Freeney was such a
surprising reach for the Colts, I referred to him as "Sweeney" in
Sunday's draft chart.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Miami cornerback Phillip Buchanon (No. 17 by Oakland).</TE>
<TE>   The justification: With 36-year-old Eric Allen near the end of his
career at right corner, the Raiders are looking for somebody to
complement all-pro left corner Charles Woodson.</TE>
<TE>   Who's happy: Buchanon, who joins a team one Raider away from
winning the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not happy: Buchanon, on learning that the one Raider is Jon
Gruden.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Hawaii receiver Ashley Lelie (No. 19 by Denver).</TE>
<TE>   The justification: Lelie, the only first-round pick in his
school's history, can make an immediate impact as part of the Bronco
passing game, which ranked a startling 25th last season.</TE>
<TE>   Who's happy: Hawaii Coach June Jones, who thinks so highly of
Lelie he recently allowed the star receiver to escort his daughter to
her high school prom. (Lelie had her home by 10 p.m.)</TE>
<TE>   Who's not happy: Lelie's delicate hamstrings, which are going to
freeze in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: UCLA linebacker Robert Thomas (No. 31 by St. Louis).</TE>
<TE>   Justification: The Rams lost London Fletcher in free agency, and
Thomas was the highest-rated inside linebacker in the draft.</TE>
<TE>   Who's happy: The Thomas family, which now has two first-round
selections: brothers Stan (in 1991) and Robert.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not happy: USC, which didn't have a player picked until
cornerback Kris Richard went to Seattle in the third round.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Tulane quarterback Patrick Ramsey (No. 32 by
Washington).</TE>
<TE>   The justification: Coach Steve Spurrier thinks Ramsey can
distinguish himself among Redskin quarterbacks Danny Wuerffel,
Dameyune Craig and Sage Rosenfels.</TE>
<TE>   Who's happy: Ramsey. What an opportunity. Wuerffel, Craig and
Rosenfels? Get real.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not happy: Redskin fans. Wuerffel, Craig, Rosenfels and
Ramsey? Get real.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Nebraska quarterback Eric Crouch (No. 95 by St. Louis).</TE>
<TE>   The justification: The Rams see Crouch as a great athlete who they
can convert into a safety.</TE>
<TE>   Who's happy:  Crouch, who landed with a team that has been to the
Super Bowl two of the last three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not happy: The Downtown Athletic Club, which just got
another reminder of what little weight the Heisman Trophy carries in
the NFL.</TE>

<HD>Bills Acquire Bledsoe From Patriots</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FOXBORO, Mass.</DL>
<LD>The New England Patriots traded Drew Bledsoe to the Buffalo Bills on
Sunday after a nine-year career in which he rewrote the record books
but watched from the sideline while his former backup led the
franchise to its first Super Bowl championship.</LD>
<LD>   The Patriots will get Buffalo's first-round pick in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   New England had been trying to trade Bledsoe since Tom Brady, a
former fourth-stringer who inherited the starting job when Bledsoe
was injured, led the team to an improbable 20-17 victory over the St.
Louis Rams in the Super Bowl on Feb. 3.</LD>
<TE>   "We all knew what the situation was: A football team can have only
one starting quarterback," Patriot Coach Bill Belichick said. "In the
end, it can only be one guy.... When you put it all together, this is
probably best."</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe, a 30-year-old three-time Pro Bowl selection, leaves as
the franchise's top quarterback in completions, attempts and yards
for a game, season and career. But he also showed his worth by
keeping quiet last season even though he was irritated that he wasn't
given a chance to fight for his job after recovering from a
life-threatening injury.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo spent the last month pursuing Bledsoe, but few other teams
expressed interest. For the Bills, Bledsoe significantly raises
expectations after a 3-13 season--their worst since 1985--and
solidifies a position that had been unsettled since hall of famer Jim
Kelly retired after the 1996 season.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're flabbergasted, we're flabbergasted that there weren't
more teams that got involved in it," Bill General Manager Tom Donahoe
said. "Everybody talks about the need for quarterbacks.... All we
know is, we're happy to know that we were in that position and had a
chance to do this."</TE>
<TE>   The Bills' previous two starters--Doug Flutie and Rob
Johnson--spent three seasons in a bitter feud over who deserved the
No. 1 job, eventually proving neither could hold it.</TE>

<LD>A big mistake by Dan Cloutier took some of the pressure off Dominik
Hasek.</LD>
<LD>   Detroit defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom scored the winning goal from
center ice as the Red Wings got back into their first-round
best-of-seven playoff series with a 3-1 victory over the Canucks
Sunday night at Vancouver, Canada.</LD>
<LD>   Lidstrom's 90-foot slap shot fluttered under Cloutier's catching
glove with 24.6 seconds left in the second period, giving the Red
Wings the lead and reducing the Canucks' lead to 2-1 in their Western
Conference series.</LD>
<TE>   Hasek finished with 22 saves. He stopped Todd Bertuzzi on a
penalty shot and was named the game's first star as the Red Wings
ended a six-game playoff losing streak that dated to last season.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 4, Chicago 0--On defense, the Blues were relentless.
They clogged the middle with a physical style of play that left the
Blackhawks struggling not only for goals, but for shots at the United
Center in Chicago</TE>
<TE>   "That's as good defensively as we've played," St. Louis Coach Joel
Quenneville said after the Blues took a 2-1 lead in their playoff
series.</TE>
<TE>   Brent Johnson stopped only 12 shots--one in the third period--for
his second shutout in a span of about 30 hours. He beat Chicago, 2-0,
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 4, Carolina 0--Brian Rafalski scored two power-play
goals at East Rutherford, N.J., as the Devils got back into their
Eastern Conference series.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Holik added a goal and an assist and Patrik Elias had three
assists as the Devils responded with one of their best games of the
season after losing the opening two games of the series.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Brian Gionta, the goat in New Jersey's overtime loss in
Game 2, also had a goal for the Devils, who took advantage of some
very undisciplined play by Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 6, Montreal 4--Brian Rolston scored twice in the first 12
minutes at Boston, but the Bruins nearly wasted a 4-0 lead before
tying the Eastern Conference series at 1-1. P.J. Axelsson, who had
only seven goals in 78 regular-season games, scored from the top of
the left circle at 17:42 of the second period to give the Bruins a
5-3 lead.</TE>

<HD>Surprising Expos Leading the East</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank Robinson has taken the Montreal Expos somewhere they haven't
been this late in a season since 1996--first place in the NL East.</LD>
<LD>   The Expos took over sole possession of the division lead Sunday,
defeating the New York Mets, 6-3, in front of 11,672 at Montreal's
Olympic Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not happy we're in first place, we're happy we're playing
good baseball," Robinson said. "Spirits are up, the guys' attitude is
up, and everything is as it should be.</LD>
<TE>   "We understand it's early so we're not going to get too happy, but
it was a nice series before the day off. We'll go out and enjoy the
day off and come back ready to go on Tuesday."</TE>
<TE>   The Expos haven't led their division this far into a season since
April 4 to May 18, 1996. After losing Thursday, Montreal won the last
three games of the four-game series.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Chen, traded from the Mets to Montreal on April 5, got the
victory. The Expos, who survived baseball's off-season plan to
eliminate them, improved to 11-8 and lead New York and Atlanta by one
game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too early to be looking at the standings," said first
baseman Lee Stevens, who homered and drove in three runs Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're playing good baseball right now. We just need to keep doing
what we're doing and later on in the year, you start worrying about
that. It's better than being in last place right now, no question."</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 5, Chicago 3--Jose Rijo's amazing comeback is complete.</TE>
<TE>   Rijo, making his first start in nearly seven years, showed flashes
of his old, dominating self, giving up only an unearned run for the
Reds at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   He gave up three hits in five innings for his first victory since
July 13, 1995, also against the Cubs. He walked one and struck out
one.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Dunn backed Rijo with a two-run triple, and Austin Kearns hit
his first major league home run, a drive to left field against Juan
Cruz (0-4) that landed on Waveland Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 4, San Francisco 0--Dave Mlicki allowed one hit in eight
innings and the Astros ended the Giants' 11-game winning streak at
Astros Field. The Giants hadn't lost at Houston's ballpark, which
opened as Enron Field in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Only J.T. Snow, who had a single with two out in the second
inning, reached base against Mlicki (2-2). The right-hander retired
the next 19 batters.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Bagwell hit his third home in the first inning against Ryan
Jensen (1-1). It was Bagwell's 352nd homer, moving him past Dick
Allen into 60th place on the all-time list.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 5, St. Louis 3--The Brewers, 3-12 when Davey Lopes was
fired as manager Thursday, swept a four-game series for only the
second time since joining the National League in 1998. They swept a
four-game series against Florida that April.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Hernandez homered and drove in two runs at Milwaukee, and the
Brewers improved to 4-0 under interim Manager Jerry Royster.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Neugebauer (1-2) survived a two-run first inning that
included three walks. He gave up two runs, five hits and walked six
in five innings.</TE>
<TE>   Mike DeJean pitched the ninth to earn his third save of the series
and fourth in five chances.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 9, Philadelphia 3--Jason Kendall, in a slump nearly all
season, hit a bases-loaded triple during a five-run second inning to
help the Pirates win their sixth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Kendall drove in four runs and the Pirates, off to a 12-5 start a
year after they lost 100 games, swept a three-game series from the
Phillies at Pittsburgh for the first time since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   The Phillies went 1-5 on a six-game trip and have lost four in a
row and seven of nine. Last season they were 5-1 against the Pirates.</TE>
<TE>   Kendall returned to the lineup after not playing for most of two
games because of a concussion suffered when he was struck on the mask
by a foul pitch Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe that knocked me out of my slump," he said.</TE>

<HD>Horry Is Providing Lakers With Real Guts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every journey, even those taken to the same place for three
consecutive springs, begins with a map.</LD>
<LD>   After wandering lost for about nine long minutes of game clock
Sunday, the Lakers finally pulled one out.</LD>
<LD>   It was wrinkled, faded, difficult to unfold.</LD>
<TE>   But so easy to read.</TE>
<TE>   It's name was Robert Horry, who, a week ago, was as appreciated as
glove compartment change.</TE>
<TE>   Today the Lakers are slumped in a rest area, dabbing their
foreheads, fanning their faces, thankful to have him.</TE>
<TE>   They want to know what it will take to win a third consecutive NBA
championship?</TE>
<TE>   They needed only to watch their veteran forward on the first day
of the trip, a 95-87 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers in front
of 18,997 at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   That was him, taking the floor to a huge ovation with 3:01 left in
the first quarter, seemingly exhausted with every step.</TE>
<TE>   That is what happens when you try to behave like a world-class
athlete less than a week after suffering a working-class
stomach-muscle injury.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing how, if you don't play two games, you lose a little
bit of your conditioning," Horry said.</TE>
<TE>   That was him, though, covering the court in a flapping,
sweat-stained shirt and grimace, sticking a hand at Rasheed Wallace,
lending a hand to Shaquille O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   That was him surviving 30 minutes of huge little tips, enormous
tiny passes, giant short sprints.</TE>
<TE>   "He did the things he usually does," said Trail Blazer Coach
Maurice Cheeks, shaking his head. "He does the little things."</TE>
<TE>   That was him, leading the Lakers to a 65-54 edge when he played.
That was him, watching the Lakers get outscored, 33-30, when he
didn't play.</TE>
<TE>   And that was most certainly Robert Horry afterward, shrugging as
if none of it much mattered.</TE>
<TE>   "Aw, we would have won without me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Would not.</TE>
<TE>   Not this game.</TE>
<TE>   Not with Rick Fox and Samaki Walker combining for six points and
nine fouls.</TE>
<TE>   Not with most of the supporting players bouncing off O'Neal and
Kobe Bryant and each other as if this playoff world was something
strange and uninhabitable.</TE>
<TE>   On a day when their ability sometimes deserted them, the Lakers
needed Horry's instincts, his reach, his touch.</TE>
<TE>   Not to mention, his guts, no matter how strained they might be.</TE>
<TE>   Said Cheeks: "He didn't look hurt to me."</TE>
<TE>   Said Fox: "It was good enough just to see him wearing the
uniform."</TE>
<TE>   It was even nicer to see him get it dirty, even though it was
sometimes ugly and at least once quite scary.</TE>
<TE>   In the final moments of the game, he bent over and grabbed his
stomach.</TE>
<TE>   At that moment, about 5,000 others bent over and grabbed their
stomachs.</TE>
<TE>   Horry being Horry, he answered fears with laughter.</TE>
<TE>   "No, that wasn't my stomach, I just got elbowed in the side," he
said. "The stomach is fine. I'm good."</TE>
<TE>   Good enough, the Lakers must hope, to survive the rest of what
could be Horry's fifth championship run (he has two with the Houston
Rockets), which would be only one fewer than Bryant and O'Neal
combined.</TE>
<TE>   It should figure that, after an odd regular season devoid of
symbolism or theme, Horry could be it.</TE>
<TE>   A veteran battling nature for one more bit of glory, battling with
a constant smile and eternal limp.</TE>
<TE>   And as much humility as he can muster.</TE>
<TE>   "I really had an awful game tonight," Horry said</TE>
<TE>   Especially that third quarter, when, after a couple of quick
Wallace jumpers loosened up the belly, he forced the top Trail Blazer
scorer into four consecutive misses.</TE>
<TE>   Then he harassed Ruben Patterson into throwing the ball out of
bounds.</TE>
<TE>   Then he tipped Fox's missed three-point attempt back to Fox, who
then hit a three-pointer to give the Lakers a 10-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   All of which led to that perfect Horry moment when, late in the
game and the Lakers leading by five, he sneaked downcourt and took a
floor-length pass and converted a layup.</TE>
<TE>   "He does things like that," Cheeks said.</TE>
<TE>   Terrible, indeed.</TE>
<TE>   "He played OK," Coach Phil Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   So he had only four rebounds, and made only two of five shots, and
seemed tentative on his trademark playoff three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   The sellout crowd understood that on this day, there were more
important things, as they honored him in the final seconds with a
standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   "I really appreciate the fans, they're used to me doing the things
that don't show up," Horry said.</TE>
<TE>   On this day, though, those things did show up, wrinkled and faded
and splendid.</TE>
<TE>   So did owner Jerry Buss, who made a rare postgame trip to the
locker room to wait patiently for Horry to finish his interviews.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted to check on Horry's health.</TE>
<TE>   But most of all, he wanted to thank him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm cool, I'm cool," said Horry, walking into the late afternoon,
a journey well begun.</TE>

<HD>Garfield's Pitching Loss a Winner for Roosevelt</HD>
<DH>Baseball: After his transfer, Romero fulfills his promise
by becoming Southland's dominant strikeout artist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ricky Romero was like a classic-model car that had fallen into
disrepair during his sophomore and junior seasons at Garfield High.</LD>
<LD>   Though the left-hander possessed promise, his air filter hissed,
his spark plugs misfired and his brake fluid leaked. Little wonder,
then, that he had a losing record.</LD>
<LD>   Then came a transfer to Roosevelt and a complete overhaul. Now,
Romero is commanding high market value after becoming the most
dominant strikeout pitcher in Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   The senior, 8-0 with 101 strikeouts in 47 innings, attributes his
transformation to Roosevelt Coach Scott Pearson and his top
assistant, pitching coach Ernie Rodriguez. That makes sense,
considering they know a thing or two about good mechanics.</TE>
<TE>   "When he came to us, his mechanics were off," said Rodriguez, a
former minor league manager who works for the Independent Scouting
Bureau. "What I tried to do was smooth his mechanics down and give
him a good rhythm and try to establish good balance with his body and
try to get him to have a good, consistent release point."</TE>
<TE>   Romero hasn't allowed an earned run in 28 consecutive innings
while compiling a 0.44 ERA this season. His performance has recently
drawn the attention of coaches from UCLA, USC and Loyola
Marymount--as well as a slew of professional scouts.</TE>
<TE>   "He has major league potential," Rodriguez said. "I think if you
project, he's going to grow another couple of inches, he's going to
put another 20 pounds [on his 6-foot-1, 170-pound frame]. And I think
he's going to throw in the 90s."</TE>
<TE>   Romero's fastball has been clocked as fast as 87 mph, enough to
overpower hitters when combined with what is considered to be almost
a major league-caliber curveball. He is also working on a changeup
that he hopes will become a regular part of his repertoire.</TE>
<TE>   Romero has struck out as many as 17 batters in a game, which he
accomplished against Harbor City Narbonne, rendering his teammates
meaningless for all but one out.</TE>
<TE>   "When I'm out there in left field, I'm just like, What am I out
here for?" said senior Cris Gonzalez. "They don't hit the ball to me.
It's just strikeout after strikeout."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, against his former Garfield teammates, Romero posted a
five-inning 10-run rule no-hitter in which he allowed two walks and
recorded 14 of 15 outs by strikeout. Romero had Garfield's final
hitter behind in the count, 1-and-2, before he popped up to second
base to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, Garfield players and coaches weren't thrilled with
Romero's departure. After striking out the first six batters he
faced, Romero came up to bat and was promptly plunked on his throwing
elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Garfield Athletic Director James Pierson said the school filed an
inquiry with the City Section over allegations that Pearson recruited
Romero, though no wrongdoing was found and Pearson insists he made no
illegal contact.</TE>
<TE>   Romero said he decided to transfer after observing the warm way in
which Pearson interacted with his players. "It amazed me," Romero
said. "It made me want to come over here and have that kind of
coaching."</TE>
<TE>   Romero said he received little pitching instruction at Garfield,
where he ran on his own and conducted his own bullpen sessions. "I
was throwing across my body, I wasn't landing right and my release
point was off," Romero said of the bad habits he developed.</TE>
<TE>   Pearson said Romero, on track to break Roosevelt records for wins
(12) and strikeouts (102), has been a plus for more than his pitching
prowess.</TE>
<TE>   "He wants to learn, and he's very coachable," Pearson said.
"Everything we do, he believes in and buys into it. He's the kind of
kid that makes me want to come to practice every day and teach the
kids."</TE>
<TE>   Romero gives Roosevelt (17-4), No. 25 in The Times' rankings, the
ultimate weapon as it attempts to break the San Fernando Valley's
stranglehold on City Section titles; Valley teams have won in 28 of
the last 29 years. Chatsworth, which has won four titles during that
span, defeated Roosevelt, 2-1, in last year's title game.</TE>
<TE>   But know Roosevelt will be revved up if it gets a rematch, with
Romero leading the way.</TE>

<HD>Blatter Backer Wins Election</HD>

<LD>The Confederation of North and Central American and Caribbean Assn.
Football (CONCACAF), soccer's governing body in this region,
apparently has cast its lot with Sepp Blatter in his bid to be
reelected FIFA president.</LD>
<LD>   That much was clear when the organization, whipped on by Americans
Alan Rothenberg, a CONCACAF vice president, and Chuck Blazer,
CONCACAF's general secretary, voted, 36-2, to reelect Jack Warner,
59, of Trinidad and Tobago as its president for a fourth four-year
term.</LD>
<LD>   Warner, like Rothenberg and Blazer, is a staunch supporter of
Blatter, who is being challenged in the May 29 FIFA election by
Cameroon's Issa Hayatou, president of the Confederation of African
Football (CAF). Warner initially was running unopposed because
CONCACAF refused to allow Edgardo Codesal of Mexico to stand for
election because he is a CONCACAF employee.</LD>
<TE>   That rule were suspended when CONCACAF's annual congress was held
in Miami on Saturday, but Codesal, referee of the 1990 World Cup
final in Rome between Germany and Argentina, received votes only from
Mexico and El Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   Blatter was in Miami to shore up his support after seeing it erode
worldwide amid allegations that FIFA's finances are in disarray.</TE>
<TE>   Europe</TE>
<TE>   Mehmet Scholl, a Bayern Munich and Germany midfielder, is
considering not going to the World Cup because he does not believe he
is fit.</TE>
<TE>   "I will talk to [Germany Coach] Rudi Voeller [this] week and will
then announce my decision," said Scholl, who has been sidelined
because of assorted injuries this season but is one of the national
team's most creative players.</TE>
<TE>   Franz Beckenbauer, Germany's former World Cup-winning captain and
coach and chairman of Bayern Munich, said it is important for Scholl
to take part in Korea/Japan '02, after being a late cut from the 1994
and 1998 World Cup teams.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to be a great player, you have to take part in the
World Cup at least once," Beckenbauer said in an interview with Bild,
the country's largest-circulation daily newspaper. "If Rudi wants me
to, I will talk to Mehmet. His participation is extremely important
for German football."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Celtic already has won the Scottish Premier League championship
this season, but its Glasgow rival, Rangers, denied it the chance to
enter the record books for winning every league home match this
season when the teams played to a 1-1 tie Sunday. Celtic had won its
previous 18 home games.</TE>

<TE>   Photographers boycotted Real Madrid's Spanish league match at
Santiago Bernabeu Stadium on Saturday, complaining of mistreatment by
Ultra Sur, the club's radical fan group. "Whenever we pass in front
of them, they spit at us, hurl objects and insult us," one
photographer told Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   South America</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's Congress is debating a bill, originally proposed by Pele
when he was the country's Minister for Sport and signed last week by
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, that would require soccer teams
to become companies subject to laws regulating all businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Brazilian teams have been treated as private clubs and have not
operated under the same laws public companies must obey. A recent
government probe exposed widespread corruption in the Brazilian game
on the league and federation level.</TE>
<TE>   Asia</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Prince Sultan bin Fahd bin Abdul Aziz, president of the Arab
Football Federation, has written to FIFA and the International
Olympic Committee asking that Israel be banned from international
competition.</TE>
<TE>   The letter, copies of which also were sent to the Assn. of
National Olympic Committees and the Union of European Football
Assns., was supported by the national soccer federations of Egypt,
Jordan, Libya, Syria, Yemen and the United Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   According to Walid Kurdy, deputy secretary-general of the Arab
Football Federation, the letter was partly motivated by the deaths of
Palestinian athletes during Israel's military offensive in the West
Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Kurdy said the longtime suspension of South Africa for its "racist
policies" was precedent for such a move.</TE>

<TE>   Jubilo Iwata and Japan national team striker Naohiro Takahara
might miss the World Cup because of a blood clot blocking an artery
in his left lung. The clot was discovered last week when Takahara,
who has scored nine goals in 16 games for Japan, was being treated
for pneumonia.</TE>

<HD>USATF Must Comply or Face Revocation</HD>
<DH>Olympics: USOC vote demands that track and field governing
body adhere to anti-doping and accounting rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Dealing USA Track and Field an embarrassing blow to its prestige, the
U.S. Olympic Committee on Sunday ordered it to comply with
anti-doping and accounting procedures by Aug. 31 or risk losing the
right to oversee the most popular sport in the Summer Games.</LD>
<LD>   The USOC Board of Directors approved a resolution that would
revoke USATF's membership in the USOC and its recognition as what is
called a "national governing body" if by Aug. 31 USATF "does not come
into compliance."</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous vote "clearly says we will take a stand," Lloyd
Ward, the chief executive officer of the USOC, said afterward. The
board has 123 members; perhaps half were on hand for the vote.</LD>
<TE>   The vote is unlikely to lead to a revocation of USATF's
accreditation. Ward and USATF's chief executive, Craig Masback, shook
hands warmly after the voting, with Ward telling Masback, "We've got
a lot of work to do together. This is a great opportunity." Bill Roe,
USATF's president, earlier told the board, "We want to get this done
as well as you do."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the vote gives USOC considerable leverage over USATF
in an area that has for months caused friction between the two
entities and generated considerable ill will internationally, much of
it owing to a specific case.</TE>
<TE>   USATF has refused to identify a U.S. athlete who tested positive
in 1999 for an anabolic steroid, was exonerated by an appeals board
and then competed in the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics. USATF,
according to a USOC report, also once failed to include sprint star
Michael Johnson's name on a list of athletes eligible for
out-of-competition drug testing; officials at the U.S. Anti-Doping
Agency subsequently added his name to the list so that he remained
eligible.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, USATF suffered from a host of logistical problems
last year in coordinating drug tests at various meets, according to a
March 29 USOC report.</TE>
<TE>   The USOC's drive is plain to understand. International Olympic
Committee President Jacques Rogge has made the anti-doping fight his
No. 1 priority, saying it's a moral imperative that cheaters not
compete at the Games. On the chance that morality plays seemed too
fleeting, or that Rogge's voice might seem too distant for the USOC's
all-volunteer directors to hear clearly, Ward, as mindful as anyone
that the business of America is business, put it simply--it's a
potential revenue-killer.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. won't stage the Games again until at least 2012, and as a
result the USOC now faces significant fund-raising challenges, Ward
said Sunday, adding that officials at General Motors, a key USOC
sponsor, have made it plain that doping "is the biggest issue facing
the Olympic movement today."</TE>
<TE>   Since September 2000, senior officials connected to the IAAF, the
International Olympic Committee, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and the
World Anti-Doping Agency have pressed for a release of the name of
the athlete who competed in Sydney. USATF has said that rules in
effect at the time of the 1999 test forbid it from identifying the
athlete.</TE>
<TE>   The stalemate was referred last week to the Swiss-based Court of
Arbitration for Sport. It has not yet set a timetable for a hearing,
or decision. If the court orders the name divulged, Masback said,
USATF will comply.</TE>
<TE>   The USOC report identified four accounting shortcomings but no
financial improprieties. USATF officials stressed Sunday that they
intend to make the situation right.</TE>
<TE>   In other developments Sunday:</TE>
<TE>   * Outgoing Salt Lake Organizing Committee President Mitt Romney
said the 2002 Winter Games generated a "substantial" profit. He did
not divulge details, though he acknowledged much of the profit comes
from a contingency fund that he said totaled about $40 million at the
end of the Games. It largely went unused during the Olympics, he
said, because "everything went perfectly."</TE>
<TE>   A full accounting is due to be released Wednesday in Salt Lake, at
an SLOC board meeting at which Romney will tender his resignation; he
is now running for governor of Massachusetts, as a Republican.</TE>
<TE>   * Because the Games generated a profit, Romney--who had said when
he took over SLOC in 1999 that he would work for free unless there
was a surplus at Games' end--announced he would accept his salary. He
was to be paid $285,000 annually; the total for the three years is
about $850,000. He said he would donate the money to charity but
would not announce the timing or gift amounts.</TE>
<TE>   * USOC President Sandra Baldwin, who also is an IOC member, said
that a special IOC panel had decided to recommend a continuation of
the most controversial reform point from among a 50-point plan
enacted in 1999--a ban on visits by IOC members to cities bidding to
host the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting earlier this month in Lausanne, Switzerland, the panel
urged that the ban remain in effect. The IOC's ruling Executive Board
will consider the recommendation in the coming weeks, perhaps at a
meeting next month in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   * Baldwin said she plans in the coming weeks to speak with boxer
Roy Jones Jr., awarded the silver medal in a disputed decision in the
1988 Seoul Olympics. Most observers believe Jones should have won
gold, and Baldwin--in the aftermath of the dispute in Salt Lake that
was resolved when Canadian pairs skaters were awarded a duplicate
gold--said she intends to lobby the IOC on Jones' behalf.</TE>

<HD>Reparations Issue Is a Smoke Screen and a Shakedown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER FLAHERTY</AU>
<BD>Peter Flaherty is president of the Washington-based
National Legal and Policy Center, a nonpartisan foundation promoting
ethics and accountability in government.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine getting sued for what your great-great grandfather
did--legally--a century and a half ago. That is the predicament of
Aetna Inc., which now faces a lawsuit demanding reparations because
the company insured slaves in the 1850s.</LD>
<LD>   Other firms that did not even exist during the time of slavery,
such as CSX Corp. and FleetBoston Financial Corp., are named in the
same suit. CSX was formed in 1980, the end product of numerous
railroad mergers and acquisitions. FleetBoston can be traced to
hundreds of predecessor banks, only one of which the plaintiffs can
single out for its links to slavery.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y., by a
36-year-old black activist named Deadria Farmer-Paellmann, puts the
value of slave labor at $1.4 trillion--almost as much as the federal
government collects in individual and corporate income taxes each
year.</LD>
<TE>   Those seeking reparations have their eyes on other potential
targets, which could include some of the nation's oldest newspapers
and universities. The Hartford Courant, Baltimore Sun and the
forerunner of the New Orleans Times-Picayune "profited" from slavery
by printing runaway slave notices during the 1800s. Harvard, Yale and
other universities were built on the backs of slave labor, it could
be argued, because their early benefactors included slave owners.</TE>
<TE>   Don't assume that the reparations lawsuits are destined to fail.
During the past few decades, it has become possible to win meritless
lawsuits, especially against corporations. A big impetus for that was
the $246-billion tobacco settlement. The prospect of billions of
dollars in tobacco money prompted state governments to abandon legal
precedent and rewrite statutes to make it easier to sue. In asbestos
litigation as well, companies with only the most tenuous links to the
substance are now being bankrupted.</TE>
<TE>   Forum shopping--the practice of finding sympathetic judges--also
has become easier, as has the practice of lawyers suing with no real
clients. In the slave reparations case, neither Farmer-Paellmann nor
the millions of blacks she claims to represent were ever slaves.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Farmer-Paellmann loses in court, she knows that because of
negative publicity generated against the targeted companies they will
be under pressure to make massive payouts to African American
interest groups.</TE>
<TE>   This is a manifestation of the new form of corporate shakedown.
Activists and trial lawyers work the media to demonize certain
companies, often prompting the latter to hand over fistfuls of cash
to make them go away.</TE>
<TE>   The master of the craft is Jesse Jackson, who extracts billions
out of corporations fearful of being branded racist if they do not
pay up.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Toyota caved in to Jackson's threat of a boycott by
pledging to spend a whopping $7.8 billion on a "diversity" plan, even
though the company already had an excellent record of hiring and
awarding dealerships to blacks.</TE>
<TE>   Other scam artists are promoting a nonexistent reparations tax
credit among African Americans. The IRS recently revealed that it had
paid out as much as $30 million to taxpayers, including four or more
current or former IRS employees, who had claimed such a credit in
2000 and part of 2001. One woman received a $500,000 payment.</TE>
<TE>   The reparations issue is a smoke screen for those unwilling to
tackle the real problems affecting blacks, such as failing schools,
crumbling inner cities and family disunity. It is an attempt at easy
money, either by litigation or by shakedown. The companies involved
must not give in to such legalized extortion. If they do, it will
never end.</TE>

<HD>Davis Is More Than a Taxing Problem for Simon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL WHALEN</AU>
<BD>Bill Whalen, a research fellow at Stanford's Hoover
Institution, worked on Richard Riordan's gubernatorial exploratory
committee in 2001.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the underdog in the governor's race, Bill Simon Jr. faces a
challenge of Himalayan proportions. The political climate in
California is harsh, particularly for novice climbers and
conservatives. Amid a controversy over his personal income taxes, can
Simon weather the first storm?</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Simon filed for an extension on his federal income
taxes, with his campaign saying the information would be kept
private. Gov. Gray Davis immediately pounced, telling reporters:
"Part of running for governor is making available your tax return so
people can see you're paying your fair share." Simon responded by
likening Davis to a hybrid of Karl Marx and Big Brother.</LD>
<LD>   The tax flap suggests two trends in this election--neither to
Simon's benefit.</LD>
<TE>   One is the question of who better defines whom. When it's over,
$100 million may have been invested in this campaign--maybe the most
ever spent to ask two questions. For Davis: "Can you trust Bill
Simon?" For Simon: "Are you better off now than you were four years
ago?"</TE>
<TE>   Last week should have been Simon's to howl, with lots of negative
news out of Sacramento about bad government and a bad economy. The
state apparently can't meet the Proposition 98 "guarantee" for school
funding; health insurance rates may go up by double digits after
mammoth increases approved by the California Public Employees'
Retirement System; taxpayers are stuck with as much as $41 million in
unneeded database software thanks to an unprecedented no-bid contract
between the Davis administration and Oracle Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of batting these softballs, Simon was bogged down in tax
hell, campaign-style. He can't afford many more weeks like this. He
has to make the contest a referendum on the incumbent's record, not
his own integrity. The first challenge facing every candidate of
considerable wealth is to demonstrate working-class values and
concerns. The image of a millionaire "hiding" his tax return is
poison.</TE>
<TE>   The second bad trend for Simon is one of media perception.</TE>
<TE>   Right from the start, there was the whispering that the White
House didn't like Simon, as he wasn't the president's first choice in
the March primary. (Richard Riordan was.) Bush's visit to Northern
California later this month is, in part, an attempt to put that to
rest.</TE>
<TE>   Simon has to show that his campaign will make history, not repeat
it.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, Davis came storming out of the primary, painting
another conservative Republican, Dan Lungren, as an extremist. Davis
has attempted the same at Simon's expense--on abortion and now, to a
degree, as a tax sneak.</TE>
<TE>   The quicker that Simon fights Davis, the quicker he dispels the
idea that Davis calls all the shots in this campaign.</TE>
<TE>   California Republicans do have one luxury: Time is on their side.
Davis soon will unveil his "May revise" to the state budget, offering
a new reality of spending options. Following that will be a summer of
budget decisions with the sort of action verbs--"cut," "slash,"
"eliminate"--that no incumbent enjoys.</TE>
<TE>   If Simon is lucky, the question of his fair tax share may seem
less important to Californians wondering what happened to their fair
share of government services.</TE>
<TE>   But if the focus remains strictly on Bill Simon, then there won't
be enough Sherpas in all of California to get him up the mountain.</TE>

<HD>A Shadow Falls Over Hope</HD>
<DH>We brought dreams for a bright economic future; Arafat
quashed them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENN YAGO</AU>
<BD>Glenn Yago is director of capital studies for the
Milken Institute, an independent, nonprofit economic think tank based
in Santa Monica.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a crystal evening in mid-September 2000, when there was still
hope, I crossed the Allenby Bridge into Israel, my luggage cart
rumbling over its wooden planks as the sun set over the Jordan River.
I was there as part of a brief and heady but ill-fated effort to
"privatize the peace process." We were hoping to bring new financial
ideas to the region, spawning cross-border projects and a new Middle
East.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe I should have known better.</LD>
<LD>   We had cooled our heels on the Jordanian side of the bridge for
three hours as Israeli border guards snared a car loaded with C-4
explosives. There were other warning signs, too: The Jordanian taxi
driver who dropped me off at the bridge was named Jihad. And there
was the call a few days earlier from an Israeli Foreign Ministry
contact warning me to dampen my expectations: "No one knows what to
do next since the Camp David meltdown."</LD>
<TE>   But as the gate to Israel swung open, Mohammad, the crisply
dressed Jordanian border guard, smiled and waved to his less
sartorially minded Israeli counterpart, Shuki. I crossed over into
Israel, and it struck me: Bathed in the golden light of that Jordan
River Valley sunset, neither Shuki nor Mohammed was armed. There
wasn't a gun in sight. "Ah," I said to Shuki, "so this is what peace
looks like."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the border crossing delay, I was late for a festive
gathering at the Peres Peace Center in Tel Aviv that evening. The
speeches were over and I arrived just in time to witness another
unbelievable sight: two stunningly beautiful young women--one
Palestinian and one Israeli--singing a two-part harmony of John
Lennon's "Imagine" in Hebrew and Arabic. I'm not particularly
religious, but I thought there must be a special blessing to be said
upon such an occasion.</TE>
<TE>   September 2000 was that in-between time after the Camp David
process crumbled and before this bloody intifada had erupted. Before
Palestinian officials winked, nodded and later gave tacit approval to
suicide and murder as a military strategy and before the Israel
Defense Forces were obliged to take the law into their own hands.</TE>
<TE>   The economic peace track was still bumping along. Despite
political setbacks, the atmosphere was upbeat. Jordan, the
Palestinian Authority and Israel agreed to become a free-trade zone
and form a joint tourist marketing program to increase visitors to
the region from 3 million to 30 million each year. Other initiatives
were underway to help finance a soon-to-be Palestinian state and
encourage cross-border economic development between the Jewish state
and its new and old Arab neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone wanted to help. Palestinians were pitching deals to
American and Israeli Jews. The U.S. and Europe were setting up
microfinance and capital markets for the Palestinians. The Israeli
finance and trade ministries cooperated with U.S. and Palestinian
entrepreneurs and industrialists to finance industrial parks for West
Bank cities, the same cities that are now burning.</TE>
<TE>   We sat around conference tables in Nablus, Ramallah and Jerusalem.
Ideas to lower financing costs to create jobs and build houses for
refugees returning to the West Bank and Gaza were flowing with the
juices of creative finance: We could use donor money from the U.S.
and Israel as a credit enhancement for Palestinian industrial bonds;
we would encourage the repatriation of Arab money to buy these new
securities and finance jobs to keep Palestinian youth out of
mischief. What about creating a water rights market to depoliticize
the issue and let the market, not politicians, determine prices for
scarce water?</TE>
<TE>   We were giddy with great notions. We could structure a peace index
fund with stocks from Tel Aviv, Amman and Nablus bringing new
liquidity into capital-starved markets. We could cross-market the
fund for baptisms, Ramadan celebrations and bar mitzvahs. Everyone
laughed exuberantly--Christian, Muslim and Jew; American, Palestinian
and Israeli. It all seemed so possible.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Yasser Arafat was a bouncing marionette, shuttling from
one world capital to the next sounding like a grizzled Rodney
Dangerfield getting no respect, dazed that he hadn't been hugged
enough at Camp David. We forgot that the Palestinian Authority,
despite the many enlightened and hard-working Palestinians we met
with, was not a market democracy with the transactional trust
required for commerce and investment but simply a gangland
dictatorship running a protection racket. No one was allowed to look
or think about financing the future, because the "Rais"--the "chief,"
as Arafat was called--couldn't envision a peaceful future because he
was addicted to his violent past.</TE>
<TE>   Each and every proposal we came up with for economic development
for and with the Palestinians was blocked until Israel would comply
with Arafat's political wishes. "Yes," we were told by Palestinian
Authority officials, "these are great economic projects and programs,
but we can't move forward until the political final status
agreement." Full stop. Time to go home.</TE>
<TE>   There was never a peace dividend for the Palestinian people
because their leadership blocked every attempt to earn one. Without a
constituency for peace, a constituency for terror quickly formed.
Private investment disappeared and donor investment shifted from
infrastructure and employment projects to maintaining Arafat's jet
and his crony government. With this intifada, unemployment tripled to
30% of the Palestinian work force and the gross domestic product of
Gaza and the West Bank fell by 12%. Arafat made Israelis miserable by
making his own people destitute.</TE>
<TE>   Stillborn, the Palestinian economy mirrors the failed regimes of
the Middle East. By refusing to help his people, Arafat has bred a
jobless young labor force that is bereft of education. The
Palestinians missed the opportunity to derive benefits from regional
trade or foreign capital flows. Instead, they live in a collapsed
economy with sinking per capita incomes. And they hold the rest of us
hostage to the highest concentration of terrorist organizations in
the world.</TE>
<TE>   Despite our best efforts, the Palestinians today have found no way
to build a country or serve a people; only a good way to start
Arafat's war.</TE>

<LD>Downtown's office towers loom over the South-Central park where gangs
killed 8-year-old Anthony Ramirez. From those peaks of power and
money, where the mantra is just-get-it-done, Trinity Recreation
Center's square of yellowed grass goes as unnoticed as another death
from gang cross-fire.</LD>
<LD>   In November, suspected gang members killed a 13-year-old doing his
homework in St. Andrews Recreation Center in South Los Angeles,
police say. In December, suspected gang members fired into Wilmington
Recreation Center. In January, staff members at a South Los Angeles
recreation center locked themselves inside in fear of shooters
outside. In March, police say, suspected gangsters fatally shot a
rival in the doorway of the Aliso Pico Recreation Center in Boyle
Heights, sending 100 people who had been watching a girls basketball
game fleeing.</LD>
<LD>   The bullies who plague this city do not limit their mayhem to
parks. Driving their criminal activity from these supposed public
sanctuaries would not eliminate the problem. The solution to street
gangs is relentless pressure and an overarching strategy that
combines private and public efforts, including the resources of
agencies ranging from the schools to the district attorney's office,
county probation to the parks department.</LD>
<TE>   A hodgepodge of fixes blossomed after the riots. Some were sappy.
Eventually, civic commitment to even many strong ones waned--but not
the poverty, unemployment and other ills that help push young men and
women into gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn plans to try again,
announcing a major anti-gang initiative that he says will include
prevention and jobs along with law enforcement. This sort of
comprehensive approach can work--if accompanied by a reliable flow of
money and a forceful leader with the guts to promptly scrap any
program that doesn't pull its weight, no matter how well-intentioned,
slickly promoted or tied to the politically connected it may be.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has already shown that he recognizes that standing up to
gangs in parks is of particular importance. Parks are places for good
kids to giggle on swings, bond at neighborhood barbecues and engage
in the sort of activities that are antidotes to a life of crime. But
that can happen only if they are safe.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has just 35 unarmed park rangers spread across 375
parks and recreation centers. Hahn has called for creating a park
police unit within the LAPD similar to the one that patrols buses and
subways. The LAPD says officers already work closely with park
rangers and that reassignment would mean cutting back on patrols
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   We don't think the mayor should micromanage the Police Department,
but the bloodshed in the parks has to stop, and, one way or another,
that means more cops there more often.</TE>
<TE>   We also hope that his plan recognizes city Parks Director Ellen
Oppenheim's ideas. She wants to enlist neighbors in a "Parks Watch"
program modeled on Neighborhood Watch and to train recreation center
staff members to recognize signs that gang rivalries are heating up.</TE>
<TE>   Police say Anthony Ramirez died after an 18-year-old gang member
and his teenage accomplices, who had been kicked off the Trinity
Recreation Center basketball court by a rival gang, responded to that
disrespect with a semiautomatic handgun and a shotgun.</TE>
<TE>   When an 8-year-old dies because selfish young men are squabbling
over who gets to shoot hoops, the problem lies three or four steps
back. What happened to those boys' families? Where was the boys club
that could have used sweat-drenched games of five-a-side to teach
conflict resolution?</TE>
<TE>   Until every part of this sprawling village accepts responsibility,
schools and streets won't be safe. And parks will have bloodstains,
like those where Anthony fell, a spot now hallowed by neighborhood
offerings of calla lilies, candles and a cherry-red fire truck.</TE>

<HD>Pentagon as Phoenix</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rachel Decker calls it weird. She was at her Pentagon desk searching
the Internet for information on a rumored plane crash into New York's
World Trade Center, as crazy as that event sounded. Suddenly, an
immense explosion erupted outside her office. An airliner, carrying
64 hijacked souls and 10,000 gallons of fuel, had skimmed the parking
lot at 360 miles an hour, nipped three light poles and slammed into
the southwest corner of America's most important military bunker. The
date, of course, was Sept. 11, 2001, 60 years to the day from the
Pentagon's original groundbreaking on the site of a fetid housing
project called Hell's Bottom.</LD>
<LD>   And it was just five days from completion of phase one of the
Pentagon's massive 16-year renovation. In fact, the terrorists struck
the five-sided symbol of American military might at its mightiest
point, the renovation. That section, unlike any other corner of the
25,000-worker building, had reinforced columns, blast windows and,
most important, fire sprinklers. Started in haste weeks before Pearl
Harbor, the Pentagon hasn't met building codes for half a century.
The same explosion and enduring fire a few hundred feet north or east
could have consumed the whole structure, killing far more than the
125 who died inside.</LD>
<TE>   Now, after one month of shock and one month's demolition and
struggle against toxic mold, plus five months of reconstructing
nearly half the renovation, hundreds of construction workers, so
determined they refused to take holidays off, are well along in the
race against their own countdown clock. The goal: have some office
workers at their desks the morning of Sept. 11, 2002. Watching and
talking to these teams in hard hats, the word "defiance" leaps to
mind. Indeed, the Pentagon's reconstruction is dubbed the Phoenix
Project.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because the military is accustomed to inevitable
casualties and takes such pride in its can-do spirit, there's nothing
funereal about the third terrorist crash site of 9/11. Hard by an
expressway across a wide, barely green lawn now patrolled by bereted
MPs with dogs that bark at the sight of each other, the attacked
corner is not a devastated destruction site but a gung-ho
construction site.</TE>
<TE>   Everything is bustle. No one stands around. While cherry trees
blossom and passenger jets again roar overhead from nearby Reagan
National Airport, twin cranes lift one-ton windows, roofing and
stones into place. Thirty percent of the Indiana limestone facing is
rehung.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the reconstruction area, the size of two Home Depots,
workers apply lessons from interviews of attack survivors--over 2,300
escaped that day. They've added exit stairs and turned every well and
hall into a hardened shelter. Emergency electrical lighting has been
replaced with photoluminescent signs that glow for hours like watch
faces; they've been placed lower, beneath potential smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon workers clearly appreciate their construction colleagues.
They smile and wave from windows bearing signs: "You Rebuild What
Evil Has Destroyed." "You're Heroes!" Secretary of Defense Donald H.
Rumsfeld is among those at every construction ceremony, staying late
to talk and autograph hard hats.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, on a nearby knoll that once wore grass, two beleaguered
saplings have been chosen as collection points for mementoes and
messages, photos of the fallen, numerous coins, plastic flowers and a
pair of children's blue mittens. Inside, hundreds of workers toil
around the clock, rebuilding their own fortified memento. Take Mike
Flocco, a sheet-metal worker from Delaware. In mid-September he
transferred to the Pentagon project to be near his son, Matthew, 21,
a sailor who perished last fall somewhere in the area his father now
renovates on sunny spring days.</TE>

<LD>Re Graham Fuller's "Start With Palestinian Statehood," Commentary,
April 18: Fuller gave his endorsement of a European proposal that
"reverses the sequence of the whole game," calling for the
establishment of a Palestinian state as the starting point of a
negotiating process instead of its culmination. It is a radical new
idea, but it actually fails to reverse the sequence of the "whole"
game.</LD>
<LD>   The correct initial step would be the recognition by all Arab
nations of the Israeli state and the establishment of diplomatic
relations with it. This should also include, of course, groups like
Hamas, Islamic Jihad and others that have publicly declared their
mission of destroying Israel itself. Historically, this has been the
Arab mission from before 1967, when the Arabs ruled the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip.</LD>
<LD>   At the recent Beirut summit the Arab nations declared to the world
that they are at last ready to accept the Israeli state as a
neighbor. Therefore there is really nothing to lose if they take this
first step in Fuller's sequence reversal of the whole peace process.
Think about it.</LD>

<TE>   There's a genuine idea that no body thought of before, at least
not in the U.S. media: Start with Palestinian statehood. I am
surprised that it took so long to come up with this idea. Here's
another idea: Occupation is a form of terrorism. America's war is on
terrorism. America should fight Israel.</TE>

<TE>   Fuller's commentary gives credence to terrorism, mayhem and
murder. Give the murderers everything they want and then they will
come to the table. What nonsense!</TE>

<TE>   I fully agree with Fuller. As a Jewish person and longtime
Zionist, I feel that there will be no peace until Israel ends the
occupation. We "peaceniks" don't get much press or air time, but we
are just as determined as those of the hawkish viewpoint who have so
much clout in Washington. We are hopeful that one day justice will
prevail for both the Israelis and Palestinians.</TE>

<TE>   The main focus of the United States in the Middle East at present

without justice?</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I sincerely hope that The Times will not allow the protest by
Jewish groups to alter the coverage of the Mideast crisis (April 18).
I have been particularly impressed with the balance of reporting.</TE>
<TE>   I read the paper each morning, writhing for both the Israelis and
the Palestinians. I have read about what it is to be an Israeli,
attempting to live day to day as we all do, and having to worry that
death and mayhem may erupt at any moment. I have also felt what it is
to be a Palestinian, also trying to live, being confined to a home,
watching neighbors die and towns being demolished. It is only when
both sides can be seen as human beings that this demonic carnage will
stop. Bias on either side would do a disservice to both and to
humanity in general, which is at a crossroads where one of the paths
leads to the apocalypse.</TE>

<LD>Requiring a vow of celibacy serves as an unintended invitation to
deviant sexual behavior. Most young people experience heterosexual
urges, which society designates as normal. The smaller percentage of
youngsters whose sexual urges deviate from that norm experience
internal conflict. They wish they experienced the same impulses as
their peers, but the God-given impulses dominate.</LD>
<LD>   A vow of celibacy resolves that internal conflict. But it does not
guarantee elimination of the socially condemned, God-given sexual
urges.</LD>

<HD>Finding the Funding for Special Education</HD>

<LD>Ruben Navarrette Jr. is incorrect that special-education programs are
adequately funded ("In Special Ed, Accountability Is Left Behind,"
Commentary, April 17). In 1995, Congress promised to fund 40% of the
cost. Until recently, it funded 8% (it is now at 17%).</LD>
<LD>   In 1999, the California Legislature declared in a resolution that
$1 billion annually was being transferred from regular education to
special education to cover the deficit. Two years ago, Orange County
lost $86 million (L.A. County lost $314 million) as a result of
Congress' failure to provide 40% funding. That's $172 for every
student in Orange County, or enough to hire 1,720 new teachers at a
cost of $50,000 each (including salary and health benefits). As
taxpayers, we send our hard-earned taxes to Washington. Washington
should keep its promise and return those funds to Southern California
to educate our future work force.</LD>

<TE>   Navarrette got many facts wrong. In Los Angeles, at least,
students are never put in special-education classes simply on a
teacher's referral. Schools must absolutely abide by the decision of
a multidisciplinary team that typically includes a school
psychologist, teacher, special-education teacher, the parents and an
administrator. The decision is based on a comprehensive assessment by
the team members. Students rarely leave special education for one
reason only; they have disabilities that substantially impact their
rate and degree of learning.</TE>

<LD>The Supreme Court has correctly, if surprisingly, ruled that we
cannot be prosecuted for what happens in our imaginations (April 17).
It's a good thing; I'd have been jailed at 12 for my fantasized
revenges against schoolyard bullies.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft complains that the rulings will make his
prosecutions "immeasurably more difficult." But that's the point.
It's supposed to be immeasurably difficult to prosecute people who
have committed no crime. The way our country works, you don't get to
put people in jail just because you don't like them. Most of us
learned that in elementary school. Perhaps Ashcroft would benefit
from a refresher course in constitutional law.</LD>

<LD>Where's the incentive to become wealthy and productive ("Wallowing in
Deficit," editorial, April 16)? Liberals insist on a progressive tax,
in which the more money you make, the greater percentage you pay in
taxes; then they turn around and deem any tax cut as being "for the
rich." If those in the top 1% pay vastly more than the bottom 60% in
taxes, they will obviously benefit more from a tax cut because they
pay more in taxes. May I suggest Economics 101 and a healthy dose of
common sense?</LD>

<HD>Bin Laden Now Wanted 'Dead and Alive'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ranan R. Lurie's April 17 commentary conjecturing the death of Osama
bin Laden was not only racist but also naive. First, to speak of some
"sword-waving" tradition in the Islamic world as though there was not
an equally developed counterpart in our own culture ("axis of evil"
ring any bells?) is a blatant attempt to create an "us and them"
mentality. Further, likening Bin Laden to an "Islamic mini-god" in
the eyes of his followers is sacrilegious (as calling George W. Bush
America's "lord and savior" would be) and a blatant misrepresentation
of even fundamentalists' beliefs.</LD>
<LD>   Lastly, when we ask about who has the most to gain from convincing
the public that Bin Laden still lives, the obvious answer is the
United States. Bin Laden's death would be a powerful martyrdom in the
Islamic world and would strengthen his cause. However, by claiming
that he still lives, the U.S. administration can continue to use Bin
Laden as a boogeyman to scare critics of its asinine "war on
terrorism" into silence. Lurie's commentary only serves to protect
the secretive, dangerous agenda of Bush's reactionary administration.</LD>

<TE>   Vancouver, Canada</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lurie states that Bin Laden no longer exists, then goes on to
explain that the latest video is old, not current, so therefore he is
dead.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Lurie, did it ever occur to you that he planned this to make
people think he is dead? I say he is alive and well and being
protected by one of the other countries there. There has been no
proof otherwise, and until there is a body that can be positively
identified as being him I shall not believe what anyone else says.</TE>

<HD>Increased CalPERS Rates May Aid Little Guys</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Healthy Profits Don't Equal Good Health," Commentary, April 18:
Jamie Court's column describing the negative impact of the large HMO
premium increases that CalPERS has agreed to on the little guys or
small business is just wrong. For years now CalPERS has utilized its
large size and leverage to gain rate concessions from the HMOs that
produced a premium that was significantly below cost. The loss on an
account of this size forced the HMOs to make up the losses from other
accounts, which are the same accounts that Court is concerned about.
This has resulted in higher premiums generated by the small accounts
being utilized to not only generate required HMO bottom lines but
also to subsidize the premium of the state's largest purchasing
group.</LD>
<LD>   This leads me to conclude that premium increases for other
employers this year will actually be less than if the HMOs had not
raised CalPERS' rates to a level to cover their cost.</LD>
<TE>   As for a regulatory solution, I do not believe that the state is
equipped to prospectively determine what a fair rate is for a given
benefit package for a given group. This proposition sounds like a
gold mine for health-care consultants and the actuarial community. A
more manageable and balanced approach would be a return to community
rating, where all groups would pay the same rate for the same
benefits. This was the original concept when HMOs were introduced to
this country.</TE>

<DH>Tragedy: Investigators search for cause of the crash that
killed two at Point Mugu Air Show. Rest of events canceled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As investigators combed the wreckage Sunday of a Navy jet that
crashed at the Point Mugu Air Show a day earlier, service members
grieved for two comrades, and base officials said it was too early to
know whether the popular event will continue.</LD>
<LD>   Navy Cmdr. Michael Norman, 39, of Oxnard and Marine Corps Capt.
Andrew Muhs, 31, who lived on the naval air base, were killed
Saturday in the crash of their QF-4 Phantom. Norman was the pilot of
the Vietnam War-era fighter jet and Muhs was the navigator.</LD>
<LD>   "A lot of this is new to us," naval police Officer Glenn Carlton
said of the crash as he guarded the front gates of the base and
turned away civilians who didn't know that Sunday's show was
canceled. "We don't see this kind of thing every day, so we adapt and
get used to it."</LD>
<TE>   Navy officials released no new information on the cause of the
crash.</TE>
<TE>   No one on the ground was injured when the jet peeled away from a
low-flying formation, wobbled out of control and pitched to the right
before diving into an area of marsh and farm fields just west of
Point Mugu.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the investigation have said that the plane likely
experienced a mechanical malfunction. Witnesses said they saw white
smoke and flames shooting from an engine moments before the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Autopsies performed Sunday morning showed that both men died from
multiple blunt force injuries, said James Baroni, senior deputy
medical examiner for Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Both crew members were married. Relatives of one of the fliers
were at the show, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   A man who answered the phone at the Muhs residence Sunday
afternoon thanked those who had expressed their condolences but said
the family was too upset to discuss the accident.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said evidence at the scene showed that at least one
of the fliers attempted to eject from the jet in the seconds before
it crashed. A private farming road leading to the crash site remained
closed and under guard by naval police Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Military investigators pored over sections of the downed craft,
which appeared to have broken up into dozens of metal chunks--the
largest no bigger than a big-rig truck engine--across a 300-foot
area.</TE>
<TE>   A farm worker who watched the jet hit from less than 1,000 feet
away declined to comment Sunday after talking with authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said they saw one of the crew members eject and fall
into the flames.</TE>
<TE>   The crash occurred about 12:30 p.m. near the Ventura County Game
Preserve, nearly a mile away from where 25,000 spectators watched
from a designated area at the base.</TE>
<TE>   The impact shook the ground and sent flames and plumes of smoke
more than 300 feet into the air. The rest of Saturday's air show was
canceled along with Sunday's events.</TE>
<TE>   Base officials said it was too early to say whether next year's
show will take place.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after the crash Saturday, Capt. Jim Rainwater, the commander
of Naval Base Ventura County, said that despite the accident, "It's
important that we have these kinds of shows" to help keep close ties
with the community.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the spectators who were turned away from the base Sunday
said they had heard about the crash but were hoping it didn't mean
the end for the air show after 39 years. Others were shocked to hear
about Saturday's accident, and several people questioned whether the
popular but risky shows should go on.</TE>
<TE>   "These are senseless deaths," said Camarillo resident Michael
Uwamawich, who was unaware of the crash as he approached the base's
front gate Sunday with his 8-year-old daughter, Angela. "For their
families it is such a waste. I would rather have had them fighting in
the war. It's just sad."</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard resident Kenneth Badoian had watched in disbelief with his
7-year-old daughter, Briana, as the jet disappeared from view and
exploded. On Sunday, they returned to Missile Park just outside the
base to leave a bouquet of flowers and a poem composed that morning.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a way of saying thanks for all they have done," said
Badoian as he stuffed a plastic-wrapped bouquet of daisies and
orchids into a water bottle used as a vase. "I have been coming to
this air show since I was a kid, so I felt like I had to do
something."</TE>

<HD>3 Activists Win $125,000 Prize for Refuge Work</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>As Congress and President Bush have debated whether to open the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, three indigenous
spokespeople have devoted their days to ensuring that the potential
effects on the land, its wildlife and their people are not
overlooked.</LD>
<LD>   Jonathon Solomon, Sarah James and Norma Kassi are members of the
Gwich'in nation and live north of the Arctic Circle in Alaska and
Canada's Yukon Territory. They have testified before Congress,
negotiated agreements to protect wildlife and traveled the world to
raise awareness and support of their fight against plans to open the
1.5 million-acre coastal plain of the Alaskan refuge.</LD>
<LD>   Their work will be rewarded today with the Goldman Environmental
Prize, given annually to people around the world who strive to
protect the environment by the San Francisco-based Goldman
Environmental Foundation. The three winners will receive $125,000.</LD>
<TE>   The refuge's future concerns the Gwich'in Indians because the
coastal plain is the annual calving ground for the porcupine caribou
herd, which numbers more than 120,000.</TE>
<TE>   The tundra is home to the caribou and a variety of other wildlife,
including peregrine falcons, musk-oxen, polar bears and millions of
mosquitoes.</TE>
<TE>   Solomon helped negotiate an agreement between the United States
and Canada to protect the porcupine caribou herd; James has traveled
the world to draw attention to the cause; and Kassi has met with
government officials and environmentalists and has organized
conferences to oppose drilling.</TE>

<HD>William Barber, 82; War Hero</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Col. William Earl Barber, who was awarded the Medal of Honor during a
military career that spanned four decades and three wars in Asia,
died in his Irvine home Friday of complications from liver failure
and bone marrow cancer, a family spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Barber, 82, was awarded the nation's highest military honor after
leading his troops to defend a key pass near the Chosin Reservoir
during one of the epic battles of the Korean War, despite being
wounded in the leg by machine-gun fire.</LD>
<LD>   Barber's company held a strip of mountain terrain near the
reservoir, close to China's border, allowing about 8,000 of his
fellow soldiers to escape an ambush by the Chinese army.</LD>
<TE>   The battle ranks in Marine history with World War II's fights over
the Pacific islands of Iwo Jima and Guadalcanal and, friends said, is
taught in military schools as an example of brilliant defense
strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Known to friends as "The Colonel," Barber first saw combat in
Japan in World War II near the beginning of a career that lasted 30
years. But it was his service in the Korean War that brought him the
most attention.</TE>
<TE>   Though well-decorated--his medals include two Purple Hearts and
the Silver Star--Barber was reticent to discuss his achievements,
preferring to dwell on the exploits of others.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a lot of sensitivity, intelligence and humility, but was a
warrior at heart," said Jerry Courtier, the family spokesman and a
friend of Barber who plans to write his biography. "You could
describe him as a reluctant hero."</TE>
<TE>   Born Nov. 30, 1919, on a Kentucky farm, Barber joined the Marine
Corps at 20. He spent the first part of World War II as a weapons
instructor at mainland bases, including Camp Pendleton, then went to
the Pacific Theater in 1944 as a first lieutenant leading a platoon
in Company E, 2nd Battalion, 26th Marine Regiment.</TE>
<TE>   When his commander was wounded, Barber took charge of the company
and led it for the last three weeks of the campaign. He was wounded
as he crawled through enemy fire to rescue two fallen comrades,
Courtier said.</TE>
<TE>   Barber's actions earned him the Silver Star for bravery and the
Purple Heart for his wounds.</TE>
<TE>   Barber was promoted to captain before being assigned to the 1st
Marine Division in Korea in October 1950. He took command of Company
F, 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment.</TE>
<TE>   In November 1950, Barber and 220 soldiers in Fox Company were
among a contingent of Marines near the Chosin Reservoir when it was
ambushed by the Chinese army, which was joining the war on the side
of the North Koreans.</TE>
<TE>   For thousands of U.S. troops, the only escape was through a narrow
pass that Barber's company was ordered to defend at all cost.</TE>
<TE>   Outnumbered at least 10 to 1, Barber's troops withstood repeated
assaults over five days in freezing weather. At one point, Barber
received orders to pull back but asked permission to remain and try
to hold out.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that we could probably hold, and I knew that if we didn't
hold, we could exact a very heavy toll," he recalled in a 1976
interview. At the end of the battle, only 82 of Barber's soldiers
could walk away.</TE>
<TE>   Barber remained in the Marines and was awarded the Legion of Merit
for service in Vietnam before retiring as a full colonel in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   Barber is survived by his wife, Ione; a son, John; a daughter,
Sharon; and three granddaughters.</TE>
<TE>   This obituary ran in some editions of The Times on Sunday.</TE>

<HD>Lawyer for Blake Wants No Cameras</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aiming to avoid the public spectacle of the O.J. Simpson murder
trial, the defense attorney for actor Robert Blake said Sunday he
will request that cameras be banned from the courtroom during Blake's
arraignment today on charges of murdering his wife.</LD>
<LD>   "Our rationale is that witnesses might be affected," said lawyer
Harland W. Braun. "Unfortunately, in Los Angeles we have people who
try to become jurors or witnesses in a big case. In the O.J. case,
some of the witnesses became personalities."</LD>
<LD>   Blake, who was arrested last week on suspicion of murder in the
May 2001 shooting death of his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, is scheduled
to be arraigned this morning in Van Nuys Superior Court.</LD>
<TE>   Braun said he was optimistic that a judge will grant his request
to ban cameras. He also said that he will make the same request at
all future court proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the judicial consensus is in our favor now," Braun said.
"To be quite frank, this case is different than a matter such as one
involving government corruption, where there is a real public
interest. This is a matter of public curiosity. There's less need for
the public to look at it live."</TE>
<TE>   After the Simpson trial, Los Angeles Superior Court judges weighed
in repeatedly against televised proceedings, though their record over
the intervening years has been mixed, said Kelli Sager, a 1st
Amendment attorney.</TE>

<HD>It's Time to Lift a Backbreaking Burden From Schoolchildren</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   Crack cocaine or cracked vertebrae. Undeveloped minds or damaged
spines. Higher costs or lower back pain.</LD>
<LD>   Locker hideaways--feared repositories for drugs and guns--or
back-busting backpacks likely to inflict early arthritis.</LD>
<TE>   These are choices the education establishment inexcusably has left
itself for California's backpacking schoolchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Can't have it all, they say: a safe school, quality education, no
new taxes and a pain-free sacroiliac.</TE>
<TE>   Let the backs suffer, they conclude. But these aren't  their backs
so it's easy to be callous and cowardly. Easier to treat students
like child laborers and schools like sweatshops than to make tough
decisions about program cuts or tax hikes, inessential curriculum and
obese textbooks.</TE>
<TE>   Especially the overblown textbooks, built like armored boxcars and
crammed with way too much junk. Pages often resemble Web sites, with
more arrows and stars than an old country singer's polyester shirt.
Too busy and makes you dizzy.</TE>
<TE>   Who's editing these things? Clearly undisciplined committees whose
members are unable to say "enough."</TE>
<TE>   Today's textbooks can be nearly the size of city yellow pages, but
they're printed on expensive glossy paper in multicolor ink with
extra-thick hard covers. Weight: maybe 5 to 10 pounds. They're
indestructible, but destructive to young backs. Not to mention the
old backs of teachers.</TE>
<TE>   The perpetrators are the people in charge: state and local school
boards, legislators and the governor. Also textbook publishers.</TE>
<TE>   The victims are 6 million school kids, kindergarten through high
school. Far too many are forced to lug book-laden backpacks--
15-25-35 pounds--from home to school to class after class and back
home every day.</TE>
<TE>   Their burdens started becoming noticeably heavier two decades ago
when school districts began yanking out lockers and not building them
into new schools. Lockers were hiding places for drugs and weapons,
administrators feared. There also were legal flaps over locker
searches versus students' privacy rights.</TE>
<TE>   So they just junked the lockers. This also conveniently saved
money. A locker costs around $140, which can mean $250,000 per new
school, plus added hallway space.</TE>
<TE>   Then the books bloated. The official explanation is new academic
"standards." We're trying to cram more knowledge into
children--regardless of whether they can absorb it or even need it.</TE>
<TE>   Backpack pain is a nationwide ailment. Roughly 5,000 emergency
room visits a year result from backpack injuries, according to the
U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.</TE>
<TE>   In Riverside, back surgeon Thomas Haider runs the Children's Spine
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing that bothers me is the younger kids coming in more and
more with back pain," the doctor says.</TE>
<TE>   "Data shows there's a clear correlation between the size of
backpacks and back pain bad enough to see a doctor."</TE>
<TE>   Physicians believe the maximum weight of a loaded backpack should
be 10% to 15% of a child's body weight. Research shows that most
packs exceed 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics counter it's all in how the pack is carried. Too many
kids just sling the bag fashionably over one shoulder, instead of
balancing their load using both straps. Haider's response: "One
shoulder is worse. But if you put it on both shoulders, there's a
direct compression of the disc. That's no good either....</TE>
<TE>   "Will it cause early arthritis? It probably will."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Haider called the assemblyman from Riverside,
Republican Rod Pacheco, who had been watching his own kids slumping
under backpacks. Pacheco introduced a bill appropriating $140,000 to
study the issue, including the link between heavy packs and spinal
damage.</TE>
<TE>   The bill passed almost unanimously. But Gov. Gray Davis vetoed it,
declaring "there does not appear to be any documentation of long-term
problems."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the governor read the bill," Pacheco says. "That
was its purpose."</TE>
<TE>   This year, Pacheco is getting help from two Democrats: tenacious
Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough) and Assemblyman Dario Frommer
(D-Los Feliz), a former Davis aide. They'll be joint authors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ironic that while promoting students' physical fitness,
they're also placing them at long-term risk for back pain," Speier
notes.</TE>
<TE>   The new bill would require the state Board of Education to set
maximum textbook weights and develop "creative solutions."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe old-fashioned lockers. Buy separate texts for the classroom
so kids can keep their books at home. But mainly lighten the texts.
And split those back-breakers into two volumes.</TE>
<TE>   This will cost dollars and the state's strapped. But we shouldn't
be saving money by maiming children.</TE>

<DH>Catholics: Emotional standoff in Azusa continues for hours

arrested and later released.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Carrying picket signs that read "House of Rape" and "Stop Crucifying
the Children," a group of protesters marched outside a Roman Catholic
church in Azusa on Sunday, prompting an emotional response from
parishioners who yelled obscenities and blocked outsiders from
entering the church.</LD>
<LD>   "Go home," shouted one parishioner at St. Frances of Rome church.
"This is a place of worship. You have no place here."</LD>
<LD>   Other parishioners yelled out obscenities and insults.</LD>
<TE>   One man who stood outside the church to keep out activists and the
media told protest organizer Mary Grant, who said she was molested by
a priest as a child, "I bet you enjoyed it, didn't you?"</TE>
<TE>   A female parishioner charged a man holding a picket sign and hit
him in the chest. Police, who had been nearby monitoring the
confrontation, were summoned by a protester.</TE>
<TE>   Norma Arista, 42, of Azusa, was arrested for allegedly assaulting
protester Jim Falls of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Sadly, this has been the posture of the church," said Grant, who
leads the Southern California Chapter of SNAP (Survivors Network of
those Abused by Priests). "To treat us as the enemy. If they blame
the victim, then they don't have to take responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   The standoff continued for several hours as parishioners walked in
and out of the church. Some cursed at protesters before entering,
while others stood outside holding hands to block the front steps to
the church. Others, however, ignored the protesters.</TE>
<TE>   Grant's group took their campaign to raise awareness of sexual
abuse by priests to St. Frances because of an investigation involving
the church's pastor, Father David F. Granadino.</TE>
<TE>   Based on an anonymous call to the sexual-abuse hotline set up by
the Los Angeles Archdiocese, the Sheriff's Department launched an
investigation of Granadino.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have interviewed more than 100 children at the church
in recent weeks. Granadino was not at the church Sunday and has
refused to comment. E-mail messages between church officials that
were obtained by The Times indicate that he has denied any
misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   St. Frances is the latest church involved in the scandal revolving
around priests who have sexually abused young people in their flock.
Allegations of abuse arose in Boston earlier this year, but have
since spread to churches around the nation, including several in the
Los Angeles Archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Archdiocese covers Catholic churches in Los
Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Grant and about a dozen SNAP members gathered outside
the Azusa church about 10 a.m. to march with their picket signs and
hand out fliers that read, "Father Granadino has been removed for a
good reason."</TE>
<TE>   Granadino is still pastor at the church, but is at a retreat,
according to church officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Any child that spent any time with Father Granadino is a
potential victim of child molestation," the flier continued.
"Patterns of behavior to think about ....Would he buy you or your
friend gifts? Ice cream? Would he take you or your friend on trips?
Any overnight sleepovers?"</TE>
<TE>   The flier asks that parishioners refuse to donate to church
collection baskets until leaders release the name of every priest
accused of molesting a child.</TE>
<TE>   "We are here to let anyone know if they've been a victim, they are
not alone," said Grant, who received a $25,000 settlement after she
accused a Los Angeles priest of raping her between ages 13 and 15.</TE>
<TE>   Before the 11 a.m. Mass, Father Michael Sears asked protesters to
stay off church property.</TE>
<TE>   As churchgoers began to arrive, SNAP officials tried to hand out
their fliers. Angry parishioners tore them up, and some tossed the
shredded paper at the protesters.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't know our church," one woman said, tears in her eyes. "I
don't believe any of this stuff. Just get out of here."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the parishioners began shouting in Spanish to SNAP member
Rita Milla, prompting her to throw down her picket sign and run away
in tears.</TE>
<TE>   "They kept calling me a stupid idiot and a liar," said Milla, who
said she was abused by a priest 20 years ago. The father of her
19-year-old daughter is a priest, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Another protester silently held her sign as a woman on her way to
church began screaming vulgarities at her.</TE>
<TE>   A woman who had just left Mass watched the scene and asked the
churchgoer to calm down.</TE>
<TE>   "We should be setting an example with our faith, not shouting
inappropriate and vulgar things," she said. Like everyone from the
church, she declined to give her name.</TE>
<TE>   Falls held his sign that read, "House of Rape," as he walked by
the church's front steps. A woman ran at him and yanked at his sign.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrested Arista, who was taken into custody on suspicion of
battery and later released.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the church, Sears and Father Roque Fernandes asked
parishioners to pray for those outside, some worshipers said.</TE>
<TE>   By 2 p.m., the protesters said things were getting out of hand and
decided to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't it sad that we were asked to stand out on the sidewalk
instead of coming into the church to share our message?" Grant said.</TE>

<HD>Club Manager Shot to Death, 3 Others Hurt</HD>
<DH>Crime: Gunman fires across parking lot at Schooners
restaurant in Lancaster. Investigators have no suspects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A gunman fired a rifle across the parking lot of a popular Lancaster
nightclub early Sunday morning, killing one of the club's managers
and injuring an owner, another employee and a customer, authorities
and the club's management said.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting occurred shortly after 12:30 a.m. outside Schooners,
a restaurant, bar and nightclub in a shopping center in the 43800
block of 15th Street West.</LD>
<LD>   The victims were taken to nearby hospitals.</LD>
<TE>   Marshall Garrison, 50, was pronounced dead from wounds to his
torso.</TE>
<TE>   The other three victims are expected to survive, said Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Sonia Parra.</TE>
<TE>   The unidentified gunman fired from across the parking lot,
possibly from the direction of a medical clinic, authorities and
employees said. Bullets pierced the glass of the restaurant's front
door.</TE>
<TE>   The motive for the shooting is under investigation. No arrests
were made.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities did not release the names of the wounded, but
employees said one of them was Patrick O'Donnell, one of Schooners'
owners.</TE>
<TE>   Garrison booked entertainment at the nightclub and produced
concerts in the Antelope Valley and at county fairs throughout
California.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Garrison was a road manager for the heavy-metal band
Iron Maiden, fellow Schooners manager Jonny Wenino said.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything that had to do with live entertainment, or bands,
Marshall had a hand in bringing it here," Wenino said.</TE>
<TE>   Schooners is a family restaurant and nightclub with sawdust on the
floor and a bar with dozens of televisions, usually tuned to sports.
Saturday night was "club night," with a deejay playing music and
several hundred people dancing.</TE>
<TE>   Employees and nightclub regulars said they were shocked by the
shooting. In the establishment's 17 years, they could not remember
anything more violent than a few bar brawls.</TE>
<TE>   "Inside we have very tight security," Wenino said.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, where the four men were shot, is more difficult to
control, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I would never have expected it to happen here," one customer
said. "It's too friendly."</TE>

<HD>Was Fatal Encounter Murder or Justifiable Homicide?</HD>
<DH>Courts: Prosecutor says suspect overreacted; his lawyer
says he acted in self-defense. Trial is set to begin in June.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No one disputes that Travarla Atwell Saffore, after dropping off a
female friend at her parents' Windsor Hills home, was pursued by a
threatening stranger in a car.</LD>
<LD>   What is in dispute is whether Saffore reacted as any reasonable
person might when he thought he was in danger.</LD>
<LD>   The stranger, as it turned out, was the woman's jealous boyfriend.
He had chased Saffore through southwest Los Angeles for about 20
minutes last November, before the two men stopped their vehicles near
a gas station at Fairfax Avenue and Washington Boulevard and got out
to face each other.</LD>
<TE>   At some point, Saffore, who was holding an open pocketknife in his
right hand, allegedly punched 21-year-old Ricky Anthony Hubbard in
the neck, mortally wounding him by slashing his throat.</TE>
<TE>   The confrontation resulted in a first-degree murder charge against
Saffore, whose trial was scheduled to begin Tuesday in Los Angeles
County Superior Court. Late last week, it was rescheduled for June7.</TE>
<TE>   Saffore's lawyer will argue that his client was acting in
self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   "If anything is justifiable homicide, this is it," defense
attorney Michael B. Zimbert said in a recent interview. "My client
had been chased by a man who threatened to kill him. Any reasonable
person could see that the victim was the aggressor."</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors say Saffore, also 21, did not have to resort to
such drastic action when he and Hubbard confronted each other.
Saffore used a martial arts move he learned as a child to cut
Hubbard's throat, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not disputing that he had been chased," said Deputy Dist.
Atty. Keri Modder. "But when they stepped out of their cars, the
defendant became the aggressor."</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts say the case is intriguing because Saffore initially
was only trying to help a friend who needed a ride home, and because
he even tried to get away from Hubbard as they drove through the
city. The burden will be on jurors to decide whether Saffore
overreacted to Hubbard's behavior or was justified in striking out,
they say.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors often file a murder charge unless the homicide
resulted from an officer-involved shooting or involved a citizen
killing a felon who was committing a crime such as an armed
home-invasion robbery, legal experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "When an individual is under risk of attack, the smartest thing to
do isn't necessarily to defend yourself but to retreat quickly or to
try and alter the situation by using management techniques to defuse
the situation," said Robert McCrie, a criminologist at John Jay
College of Criminal Justice in New York. "If those options aren't
available, then a person should try to use minimal force. But that's
often hard to determine."</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie Sweeney, Hubbard's fiancee, said at a February pretrial
hearing that she and Hubbard, who had been dating for four years, had
a disagreement over the phone the evening of Nov. 15.</TE>
<TE>   When Hubbard--who did not have a driver's license or a car--asked
if she needed a ride home, Sweeney told him she'd get one on her own.
Several hours later, she called Saffore, a friend she said she had
known for two years.</TE>
<TE>   About 2:30 a.m., Saffore borrowed a friend's white Chevrolet
Lumina and drove from his mother's southwest Los Angeles home to
Inglewood to pick up Sweeney. He took her to her parents' house, and
they spoke for a short while in the car before Sweeney went in.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney, 20, said she was surprised to see Hubbard waiting in a
borrowed Chevrolet Camaro. "He said he was going to stay home, and I
was going to talk to him at 4 a.m." She was also a little worried,
Sweeney said, because Hubbard had a fiery temper.</TE>
<TE>   While following Saffore, Hubbard used his cell phone to call
Sweeney and asked who Saffore was, Sweeney said. He asked if she was
cheating on him. Sweeney told him Saffore was just a friend.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to tell him to come back to my house," she said. "He
was just going off on me.... He said, 'I'm gonna kill him.'"</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, the car Saffore was driving got a flat tire. He
pulled over by the gas station.</TE>
<TE>   Working nearby was a construction crew that included Jack Carlson
and Albert Sanchez. Both men saw the confrontation between Saffore
and Hubbard and testified at the preliminary hearing in February.</TE>
<TE>   Carlson said Saffore stepped out of his car first. Moments later,
Hubbard's car pulled up and he got out too, Carlson said.</TE>
<TE>   Saffore and Hubbard were shouting at each other, but Carlson and
Alvarez said they couldn't make out what was being said above the
sound of the construction machinery.</TE>
<TE>   Carlson and Alvarez said Saffore approached Hubbard. The men
argued for about 40 seconds, Carlson said. Then Saffore punched
Hubbard.</TE>
<TE>   After his arrest, Saffore told police he came to a stop because he
had blown his front passenger-side tire when turning onto Fairfax
Avenue. He said that he saw a screwdriver in Hubbard's left hand and
that Hubbard had identified himself as a gang member.</TE>
<TE>   Saffore told police that Hubbard attempted to strike him with the
screwdriver. Saffore said he reacted by punching Hubbard and cutting
him with the pocketknife. Saffore said he didn't know how badly
Hubbard had been hurt when he left the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles police said they had no evidence that Hubbard was a
gang member. Det. Frank Weber said investigators found a screwdriver
in Hubbard's right pocket.</TE>
<TE>   Hubbard's family declined to be interviewed for this story.
According to county officials, he was a construction worker who lived
with his mother in Gardena.</TE>
<TE>   Saffore, who had recently graduated from American Barber College,
grew up in southwest Los Angeles and Culver City. His father,
Charles, said he has a 2-year-old son and had been working full time
as a barber.</TE>
<TE>   Zimbert, the defense lawyer, said Saffore was arrested several
years ago for assault, but no charges were filed. More recently, he
was convicted twice of driving while intoxicated, the lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Saffore, a retired McDonnell Douglas manager, said he
taught his son to first "flee from danger, then fight in order that
you don't become extinct."</TE>
<TE>   He and his ex-wife, Saffore's mother, Catherine, attend almost
every hearing with other family members. "I know my son's spirit, and
I'm reassured that everything will be OK if we have courage," Saffore
said. "My son was avoiding evil. He would be dead if he didn't do
anything."</TE>

<HD>Extended Fire Season Begins With 2 Blazes</HD>
<DH>Safety: About 15 acres near Lake Casitas and one near
Seacliff burn. Property owners are warned to clear brush.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fueled by record dry conditions, a brush fire burned 15 acres south
of Lake Casitas on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze started about 1:30 p.m. along Red Mountain and burned
north toward Casitas Dam. The cause was unknown, fire officials said,
but downed power lines were reported in the area.</LD>
<LD>   No homes were threatened and there were no injuries. Fire crews
had the blaze contained in about two hours.</LD>
<TE>   "They made quick work of it," said Joe Luna, spokesman for the
Ventura County Fire Department. "It is the first fire of the season,
which we opened a month earlier than usual because of the fire
danger."</TE>
<TE>   A second fire broke out about the same time Sunday near Seacliff.
It burned less than an acre along Highway 101 before crews
extinguished it.</TE>
<TE>   Fire season usually runs from May 15 through November. But after
one of the driest winters on record, fire officials last week moved
up the start to April 15 and warned that fire danger will remain high
until Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   "It is going to get worse as we get into the hotter, drier
months," Luna said.</TE>
<TE>   Rainfall totals for Ventura County are less than 7 inches since
July 1, compared with nearly 24 inches at this time last year.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, fire officials mailed 17,000 weed-abatement notices
reminding property owners to clear brush within 100 feet of their
homes to curtail potential fire danger.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners have until June 1 to comply or risk being fined $635
and billed for county cleanup crews to do the work.</TE>

<HD>Jewish Painting Party Gives Clinic a Face Lift</HD>
<DH>Charity: Hollywood temple volunteers mark day of service at
Pico-Union medical facility, and with more than 70 other projects.</DH>

<LD>The two-story Clinica Para Las Americas normally looks rundown
compared to its neighbor, the towering, 350-bed St. Vincent Medical
Center.</LD>
<LD>   But on Sunday, the free clinic in the Pico-Union area got some
special attention and a substantial face lift: fresh white paint on
the interior, and yellows, greens and reds on an aging Latin
American-themed mural outside.</LD>
<LD>   Two dozen volunteers, armed with paintbrushes and energy,
descended on the clinic as part of Mitzvah Day, a day that Jewish
groups dedicate each year to charitable acts.</LD>
<TE>   The painting party was one of more than 70 events organized in and
around Los Angeles by the Social Justice Committee of Temple Israel
of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Other activities included cooking lasagna for hospital AIDS
patients and bowling with developmentally disabled adults.</TE>
<TE>   Clinica Para Las Americas, founded in 1989 to give primary medical
care to low-income, uninsured Latino immigrants, operates on a
$1.5-million annual budget from public and private sources. Sprucing
up its appearance is a luxury on which it can't afford to spend
funds.</TE>
<TE>   "The money that we get goes to provide services," said Linda
Dacon, the clinic's director. "It doesn't go to paint the clinic. It
doesn't go to [repair] the termite problem."</TE>
<TE>   In about three hours, one team had scrubbed and painted most of
the 18 offices and examination rooms on the clinic's lower floor.</TE>
<TE>   Two young girls, covered in white paint specks, darted through the
still-wet hallways after finishing their tasks.</TE>
<TE>   "We painted the trim," said Chloe Horowitz, 6, running her hand
along a door frame. Her friend, Zoe Reid, 7, chimed in: "We also
painted a wall--except for the high-up part."</TE>
<TE>   Another team sanded and retouched the peeling and faded mural,
which portrays scenes of domestic life.</TE>
<TE>   The volunteers discussed how to restore the painting of a woman
sitting on a balcony railing next to a man bent over peeling a basket
of apples.</TE>
<TE>   After deciding that the woman's dress was light red only because
of sun exposure, they decided on a vibrant, blood-red shade to
restore it.</TE>
<TE>   Sonny Estrada, 42, a member of Temple Israel, painted climbing
vines and baskets of flowers on a large patch of undecorated wall
that has become a favorite target of graffiti vandals.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems as though any time there's a picture of something, they
avoid it," Estrada said. "It's sort of a deterrent."</TE>
<TE>   Dacon distributed water bottles to volunteers and marveled at the
work.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like putting a sign in front of here [that reads]: 'Please
don't put graffiti here. We're probably providing your family with
free health care,'" she said.</TE>

<HD>Priest Forced to Quit Has Been Assisting Fraternities</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Orange County priest whose alleged molestations of a teenage
boy led the Roman Catholic Church to pay a $5.2-million settlement
has been hosting gatherings of young men in his home as part of an
unpaid job as an advisor to college fraternities.</LD>
<LD>   As recently as April 6, Michael Harris hosted a retreat for Sigma
Pi pledges from Cal State Long Beach at his Oceanside house,
according to the chapter president. A few weeks earlier, chapter
leaders from Long Beach, Cal State Fullerton, San Diego State and UC
Berkeley met there.</LD>
<LD>   Harris spoke to presidents of Sigma Pi's 140 chapters in St. Louis
in February, six months after the record settlement by the dioceses
of Los Angeles and Orange County made national news. Harris has
denied the allegations. Church officials settled the case "for their
own business reasons," he said. He reluctantly agreed to leave the
priesthood.</LD>
<TE>   Harris did not return phone messages left at his office.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, when he resigned as principal of Santa Margarita Catholic
High School in Rancho Santa Margarita, Harris told supporters in a
letter that he was leaving because of stress. Afterward, however, the
Diocese of Orange flew Harris to St. Luke's Institute in Maryland, a
treatment center for priests.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors there concluded Harris was sexually attracted to
adolescent boys and that there was substance to the molestation
allegations. "In one of the interviews, he did admit that he has been
sexually aroused while hugging adolescent boys," according to a
report made by the St. Luke's medical staff. The doctors recommended
in-patient treatment, which Harris refused, and that he have no
unsupervised contact with minors.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the dioceses of Orange and Los Angeles disclosed that
they had paid $5.2 million--at the time the largest publicly
disclosed settlement of its kind--to a Laguna Hills man who had filed
suit alleging that Harris molested him in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Superior Court Judge James P. Gray also ordered the
church to issue public apologies to the Laguna Hills man and four
others who said Harris had molested them. The judge said the victims'
stories "made my skin crawl."</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office determined there was not enough
evidence to prosecute the former priest.</TE>
<TE>   Sigma Pi's national leaders said they stand behind Harris. Noting
that he has never been charged with a crime, the leaders--adults who
left college years ago--said they see nothing wrong with his advising
young men. Sigma Pi's national president, Ed Panconi, declined to
talk about Harris, except to say in a prepared statement that the
former priest "has been very helpful to us in presenting educational
programs over the years and we appreciate his work for us.</TE>
<TE>   "To our knowledge he has never been determined by a court of law
to have engaged in any criminal or civil wrongdoing, and in our
country, people are considered innocent until proven guilty. We
believe that Dr. Harris is entitled to that same presumption and we
support him as a brother during this difficult time."</TE>
<TE>   But an official for a national association of fraternities said
that Greek organizations should be cautious about who serves as role
models for impressionable young men.</TE>
<TE>   "Their behavior should always be above reproach," said Jon
Williamson, executive vice president of the North American
Interfraternity Conference, which represents 66 fraternities on 800
campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Katherine K. Freberg, an attorney for the plaintiff who won the
record settlement and an apology, expressed outrage that Harris would
continue to have contact with youths.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were assured they were all males over 18, confident in their
sexuality, confident within themselves, I wouldn't have a problem
with it," Freberg said. "But someone under 18 or someone who hasn't
quite come to terms with their sexuality, to put them with someone
who has that power and control over them, could sway them to do
something they normally wouldn't, I would have a problem with that."</TE>
<TE>   Fraternity chapters are private organizations, so campus
administrators have little authority over them. If the group's house
is off campus, officials can only prohibit the organizations from
using campus facilities.</TE>
<TE>   While some undergraduates in local chapters knew of Harris'
problems, others did not. "This is new to us," said Steve Dias,
president of the San Diego chapter. "I'd have to bring it to my
chapter to discuss."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Harris, president of the Berkeley chapter, said he met the
former priest at the March meeting at Michael Harris' house. He
didn't know about the molestation allegations until a reporter told
him.</TE>
<TE>   Some fraternity members were following the national organization's
lead. "Our whole chapter supports the monsignor," said Jeff Blackman,
president of the Long Beach chapter, using Harris' former title. "He
really does phenomenal things for us."</TE>
<TE>   For many years, Harris was the public face of the Catholic Church
in Orange County, a man revered for his charisma, good looks and
powerful public-speaking abilities. As a priest, he developed
connections with business and social leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Since being forced to give up the priesthood, Harris has started a
business that develops low-income housing with the help of government
funds. His board of directors includes some of Orange County's most
prominent businesspeople.</TE>
<TE>   The man who introduced Harris to Sigma Pi was John Merino, a
friend for decades and assistant principal at Mater Dei when Harris
was principal there. Merino for years has guided Mater Dei boys into
Sigma Pi.</TE>
<TE>   Merino, 66, has been national president of the fraternity and
served on the Grand Council for a decade. Merino started the Long
Beach chapter when he was an undergraduate and is the chapter
advisor. He also founded the Fullerton chapter and served as its
advisor.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you going to condemn somebody because they're accused and not
convicted?" Merino asked. "It didn't go to trial where he could
refute it. To me [the settlement] was a big mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Merino said Harris has spoken at about half a dozen national
conferences, has been involved with chapters for about 10 years and
helped write a national handbook.</TE>
<TE>   Merino said he told a national Sigma Pi leader about the
allegations against Harris when they surfaced. "I said allegations
had been made and nothing had been proven," Merino said.</TE>
<TE>   David Defilippo, advisor to the Fullerton chapter, downplayed the
allegations against Harris: "I don't think it's important to
anything. I don't think it's relevant to the frat."</TE>

<HD>Apartment Plan in Horse Country Causes Outcry</HD>
<DH>Simi Valley: Builder requests zoning to accommodate a
three-story complex. Residents say it's wrong for the area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARRI KARUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Worried that a proposed three-story hotel would be built next to his
Simi Valley home, Tracy Jeffrey moved 18 months ago to raise two
Arabian horses and his goat in peace.</LD>
<LD>   Now, after relocating to another semi-rural equestrian
neighborhood in town, the 39-year-old plumbing contractor is upset
that two Los Angeles County developers want to build a three-story
apartment complex adjacent to his new house on Leeds Street, which
lacks curbs or sidewalks.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought I was away from any more three-story developments," he
said. "I thought it would be a single-story home [built] next to me."</LD>
<TE>   Simi Valley Investment Co. in Encino and MW Development of Santa
Monica plan to build a 202-unit apartment complex along Los Angeles
Avenue, between Stearns Street and Ralston Avenue. The project, which
also would include three single-family houses and two parking
structures, would extend to Leeds. The 81/2-acre site is next to
Rancho Santa Susana Community Park and across the street from the
city's train station.</TE>
<TE>   The developers are scheduled to appear before the Planning
Commission on Wednesday to ask for a rezoning of the property to
high-density development and for permission to subdivide it into four
lots. An amendment to the city's general plan would be needed.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Weyrick, president of MW Development, said the project, to
be called Spanish Villas at the Park, is ideal for the neighborhood
because it would offer 51 affordable apartments and be within walking
distance of stores and the Amtrak and Metrolink station.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the obvious ways to try to mitigate traffic is to locate
near transportation hubs," Weyrick said. "Someone can live in the
apartment complex, literally walk across the street and go to work in
Los Angeles" without using an automobile.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the city has already approved Parker Ranch, a 324-unit
apartment complex under construction just down Los Angeles Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   But Jeffrey and his neighbors have no desire for apartments in
their neighborhood of single-family homes on lots of at least half an
acre.</TE>
<TE>   They fear the project would lead to additional high-density
developments, attract crime and obstruct their views of the
mountains. Homeowners also worry that future tenants would complain
about the dust and odor caused by horses and other livestock and try
to force existing residents to move.</TE>
<TE>   But the principal concern is increased traffic. Residents fear
apartment dwellers would speed down their quiet streets en route to
the Ronald Reagan Freeway, threatening the safety of children and
people on horseback.</TE>
<TE>   Ralston Avenue resident Brent Radley said traffic is already a
problem. "When the train comes, everybody has to turn right down our
street. People use it for a speedway," he said. "I have three
children; they like to play in the frontyard. People fly down the
street with no regard for anything."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Bill Davis is reserving judgment on the project until it
reaches the City Council, but thinks it may infringe on the
neighboring equestrian community.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a problem with apartments abutting horse-keeping
properties," Davis said. "We desperately need apartments, especially
affordable apartments. The problem is, where's the best location? You
can't put a three-story apartment complex in the middle of
single-family detached homes."</TE>
<TE>   Spanish Villas at the Park would be a 40-foot-high apartment
complex on about 61/4acres and featuring one- to three-bedroom units.
About a quarter of the units would be priced for qualifying
low-income renters--from $600 to $1,100 per month. Three
single-family houses would be constructed on the remaining 21/4acres
along Leeds Street.</TE>
<TE>   The developers would build 445 parking spaces, including 270
contained in two four-level parking structures. City code would
normally require 505 spaces for a project this size.</TE>
<TE>   But Tony Stewart, a city project manager, said the Planning
Commission may decide the 60 spaces aren't needed if enough future
tenants would likely use mass transit.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey just wants the project to go away.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not compatible with this area," he said. "There are too many
other places in Simi Valley where this thing could go."</TE>
<TE>   The Planning Commission meets at 7:30 p.m. at Simi Valley City
Hall, 2929 Tapo Canyon Road. The City Council will likely vote on the
proposal in late May or early June.</TE>

<HD>Paying Dues in Internships</HD>
<DH>Career: College students are under pressure to accept even
volunteer positions to improve chances at future jobs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For college students hoping to find a job after graduation,
completing an internship is virtually becoming a prerequisite.</LD>
<LD>   What happens, though, when students who must work to put
themselves through school are offered internships at no pay? And what
if some of the more elite internships ask students to relocate for 10
or 20 weeks at a time to such cities as New York or Washington, where
rents are exorbitantly high?</LD>
<LD>   With fewer paid internships available, college career counselors
and employers say students should cobble together whatever financial
resources they can or expect to get left behind.</LD>
<TE>   "There are quite a few ways to get money--if you're willing to do
a search and if your school is willing to help," said Dario Bravo,
assistant director of internships and study-abroad services at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think [students] first have to resolve the fact that they
have to do an internship. It's not a choice anymore," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Seventy-seven percent of graduating seniors will have completed at
least one internship before finishing college, according to a
nationwide survey of 1,000 of last year's graduating students.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty-six percent will have participated in two or more
internships.</TE>
<TE>   Vault Inc., a New York-based provider of career information and
research, surveyed students from 30 of the nation's top 50 colleges
and universities.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the overall trend is that students are increasingly doing
internships," said Mark Oldman, the founder of Vault.</TE>
<TE>   Students at more competitive schools find it easier to complete
unpaid internships because they are more likely to receive financial
support from parents, Oldman said. "But even at non-elite colleges,
we found an increasing number of students doing internships."</TE>
<TE>   By the time UCLA senior Jane Chongchit graduates in June with a
degree in international development studies and political science,
she will have done two internships and lined up a third.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, she worked for the U.S. Department of Education in
Washington. In spring 2001 she traveled to Chile to intern with
Amnesty International.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, she will intern at the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok.</TE>
<TE>   In between, Chongchit, 22, studied for a semester at the
University of Havana in Cuba and worked on the UCLA campus to help
pay for her education.</TE>
<TE>   To support herself during her internships--all of them unpaid--she
saved money from her work-study job at the campus career center,
earned $1,000 in scholarships offered by the University of California
system and received grants, such as a $15,000 award from the National
Security Education Program.</TE>
<TE>   She saved money on living expenses by staying with a family friend
in Virginia while interning in Washington, Chongchit said.</TE>
<TE>   And she even earned money by singing Valentine's Day and Mother's
Day telephone greetings for $5 a pop.</TE>
<TE>   Chongchit was fortunate in that the EXPO Internship and Study
Abroad Center--part of the UCLA Career and Internship Center--helped
her not only find internships but also ways to help fund her stints.</TE>
<TE>   The EXPO center estimates that a summer internship in Washington,
for example, can cost a student about $4,500.</TE>
<TE>   It encourages students to raise money and apply for scholarships
and grants to help with finances.</TE>
<TE>   But many college career counselors, including those at USC and Cal
State Northridge, lament that their schools are unable to provide
funding to students themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they do what they can to help students find the
internships and outside scholarships and grants to pay for them.</TE>
<TE>   Finding funds can be tedious, Chongchit said, but the benefits of
an internship far outweigh the work put into paying for it.</TE>
<TE>   "In a school with 35,000 students, if you just get straight A's
and stay at UCLA with no outside experience, you become a number,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   "With these other things--work, internships, volunteering and
study abroad--you stand out."</TE>
<TE>   That Chongchit managed to balance so many commitments while in
school bodes well for her post-graduation prospects, internship
coordinators said.</TE>
<TE>   Eileen Kohan, associate dean and executive director of the Career
Planning and Placement Center at USC, said students who successfully
juggled classes with outside internships are the same who line up
postgraduate jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty percent of USC's class of 2001 who had jobs at graduation
had completed some kind of an internship, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's pretty dramatic," Kohan said.</TE>
<TE>   Internships offer students a preview of what work in their chosen
profession will be like, she said. For some, the experience
reinforces their career decision; for others it provides a chance to
change their plotted path.</TE>
<TE>   Attila Adam, 34, a senior at Cal State Northridge, worked as a
draftsman before returning to school to study cinematography. Last
summer, he interned at Sony Studios in Culver City.</TE>
<TE>   Although he often did only light office work or answered
telephones, he said he learned a lot just by watching others complete
projects in television and movie post-production.</TE>
<TE>   "You see things that you don't learn in school," Adam said.</TE>
<TE>   Even though most entertainment internships are unpaid, completing
one is crucial, Adam said, because getting a job without one would be
nearly impossible.</TE>
<TE>   At an entertainment industry job fair, Adam said, "Almost every
speaker emphasized that, when they look at a resume, they look at how
many internships you've done and how good you were at them."</TE>
<TE>   Employers will often pluck prospective hires from the pool of past
interns, said Alexandra Morris, who coordinates the post-production
internships at Sony.</TE>
<TE>   Adam said he was able to complete his 120-hour unpaid internship
because his wife works as a banker and he also earned money doing
freelance drafting work from home.</TE>
<TE>   But anyone, regardless of financial burden, should complete an
internship before graduation, Adam advised.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the only experience you're getting, with a real job," he
said. "Everything else is book knowledge and school projects."</TE>

<DH>Security: California National Guard will close operations
at 28 facilities by May 10.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When uniformed troops from the California National Guard end their
seven-month deployment at Los Angeles International Airport next
week, they will do so knowing that they helped make the airport a
safer place, the guard's top officer said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "The physical presence of our military here, I think, has had a
great impact," said Maj. Gen. Paul D. Monroe Jr., head of the
California National Guard. "LAX is as safe as it's ever been."</LD>
<LD>   The Guard announced last week that it would leave the 28
California airports at which its troops are stationed by May 10. The
demobilization could take an additional three weeks.</LD>
<TE>   LAX will be the first of those airports to lose its National Guard
presence, at midnight April 30. The departure plans for other area
airports are still being finalized.</TE>
<TE>   In preparation for their departure, Guard officials Sunday began a
six-day tour of the state, during which they will thank troops and
work out transition plans with airport personnel. Their first stops
included LAX, John Wayne Airport in Orange County and San Diego
International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   More than 800 members of the California National Guard have been
providing anti-terrorist security at commercial airports since Oct. 5
following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Nationwide, more than 8,000
National Guard personnel have been positioned at 435 commercial
airports.</TE>
<TE>   The most visible sign of the Guard's mobilization has been the
presence of troops wearing green camouflage uniforms and carrying
M-16 assault rifles.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers at LAX had different reactions to news of the Guard's
departure. Currently, about 100 troops are stationed at LAX, down
from a peak of 181 during the holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   "The fatigues and the M-16s kind of make a statement," said Jim
Messerschmitt, 43, of Long Beach, who was traveling to Las Vegas with
his wife, Cheryl. "I think it's a deterrent."</TE>
<TE>   Susan Wells, a native of England, agreed. "I used to think it was
quite scary seeing them with guns," she said. "But it's quite
reassuring."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Wells said, she thinks it's too premature for the Guard
to leave. "You still hear all the stories about the security not
being as good as it might be."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, James Crawford, from Pescadero in the Bay Area,
called the presence of the National Guard troops "worthless."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they add any security," he said. "It makes it look
like a third-world airport. I think it's all show."</TE>
<TE>   The total cost of deploying troops at the state's airports is
expected to reach $43 million by the May end date, California
National Guard officials said, but the federal government has pledged
to pick up the tab.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Martinez, an airline mechanic from Los Angeles, said she
believes the Guard deployment is wasting taxpayer dollars. "The guns
are not loaded anyway, so what can they really do?" Martinez said.
"They're standing around looking bored."</TE>
<TE>   Martinez is correct that Guard troops don't carry loaded weapons
on orders from the Federal Aviation Administration, which has
overseen the deployment.</TE>
<TE>   But Guard officials say troops have been far from bored. Soldiers
and airmen have helped remove intoxicated and belligerent passengers
from airplanes and evacuate terminals during dozens of recent bomb
scares, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In one instance, a guardsman dived to catch a baby who had fallen
out of a cradle while its parents were being searched by security
personnel.</TE>
<TE>   "Your National Guard has served with pride and distinction during
this entire period," said Col. William H. Wade II, commander of Joint
Task Force AEROSAFE. "They have helped restore faith" in air travel.</TE>
<TE>   Guard officials say their mission initially was scheduled to end
March 31, but it was extended to give the new Transportation Security
Administration time to prepare a safety plan.</TE>
<TE>   When their deployment is over, Guard members will return to their
families for a leave before returning to their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ready to go back," said Airman Chris Cardoza, 24, who left
college and a job at a moving company in San Diego when he was called
up for Guard duty at LAX. "At the same time, if something breaks out,
I'll be ready to go active duty again if the military needs me," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Master Sgt. Michael Steadman, squad commander at John Wayne
Airport, said he and his 25 troops feel they have made a difference.</TE>
<TE>   "We hate to be here for the reason we were here," he said. "But we
got no complaints from the public, even the folks we see standing in
those long lines. And a lot of folks told us they wouldn't have flown
if they didn't see the National Guard at the airports."</TE>
<TE>   Steadman, a high school teacher who lives in Phelan, said he and
his squad, many of whom have been staying at a Costa Mesa hotel, are
looking forward to returning to their families and their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "I miss the kids," he said of his students at Eagle Summit
Community Day School.</TE>

<HD>J. Lewis, 70; Creations Gave New Sounds to Jazz</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Juno Lewis, a musician, composer and instrument maker best known for
"Kulu Se Mama," the composition that became a key element in one of
jazz saxophonist John Coltrane's later recordings, has died. He was
70.</LD>
<LD>   Lewis, a fixture in the Leimert Park section of Los Angeles, died
April 9 of complications from a stroke at Daniel Freeman Memorial
Hospital in Inglewood.</LD>
<LD>   Born Julian Bertrand Lewis in New Orleans, Lewis showed an
affinity for art at an early age, fashioning drums and learning to
sculpt using mud from the nearby Mississippi River. By the age of 16,
Lewis was working as a professional musician, primarily as a drummer.</LD>
<TE>   After moving to Los Angeles in the 1950s, Lewis formed his own
Caribbean-style band, which performed in some of Hollywood's top
clubs and hotels. He was also one of the early black performers to
find work in Las Vegas, playing at the Thunderbird Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   But by the early 1960s, the eclectic Lewis had given up his band
work and was focusing on his real passion--making drums and other
musical instruments.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, he produced an array of odd-looking and
odd-sounding instruments: trumpets with double bells, and a horn that
looked like a saxophone grafted onto a trumpet. Each would offer a
sound much different in pitch from its standard counterpart.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis said he got the idea for double-belled horns from watching
the stances of such musicians as Miles Davis, who seemed to blow
their instruments in every direction except straight out in front of
them.</TE>
<TE>   To supplement his income, he opened a studio, Juno's Conga
Village, where he taught and made drums.</TE>
<TE>   "Drum rhythms are the heartbeat of the world," he told friends.</TE>
<TE>   He viewed drum-making as a sacred calling.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1960s, Coltrane's band was appearing in Los Angeles at
the now-defunct It Club. Some mutual friends introduced Lewis to
Coltrane. Lewis showed Coltrane his long work, "Kulu Se Mama," a
lengthy autobiographical poem that reflected his pride in his
ancestors and strong sense of tradition.</TE>
<TE>   Weeks later, Coltrane invited him into an L.A. studio to join his
regular band. They recorded "Kulu Se Mama," which took up a full side
of the album and became the name of the record.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis sang in a Creole dialect and played conch shells as well as
his own handmade instruments.</TE>
<TE>   In the liner notes for the album, noted critic Nat Hentoff called
the performance "an absorbing, trance-like fusion of tenderness and
strength, memory and pride."</TE>
<TE>   "For all its length," Hentoff wrote, "the work has an organic
tonality; and at the end, there is a fulfilling sense of
achievement--of a long-nurtured and developed story finally being
told."</TE>
<TE>   It was one of the last recordings of the legendary Coltrane before
his death from liver cancer in 1967 at the age of 41.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis had hoped that the proceeds from the album would fund a
cultural center for youth in Los Angeles where he could teach music.
However, that dream never materialized.</TE>
<TE>   "Kulu Se Mama" was one of the few albums on which Lewis performed.
He played one other time with Coltrane, in a concert at Stanford. In
the 1970s, he worked with trumpeter Freddie Hubbard and drummer Billy
Higgins.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to his life as an instrument maker and began a
business promoting music for children, which he kept going for 10
years.</TE>
<TE>   The longtime resident of Los Angeles took a loft in Leimert Park
in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "[He] was a father figure in the community," poet Kamau Daaood
said of Lewis. "He didn't teach in a traditional way, but shared his
experience with younger members of the community."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis is survived by several children.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is scheduled for Saturday from 5 to 8 p.m. at
the L.A. Friendship Center, 5899 Venice Blvd. An open jam session in
his honor will follow at the World Stage, 4344 Degnan Blvd., Los
Angeles.</TE>

<HD>El Toro Airport Planners Near Runway's End</HD>
<DH>Government: Board takes steps to transfer the agency to the
county executive office, where it could be dissolved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By pretty much every measure but officially, Orange County's
high-flying El Toro airport planning machine is dead.</LD>
<LD>   Voters scrapped plans for an airport at the closed Marine base on
March 5. And with last week's Board of Supervisors vote, the El Toro
Local Redevelopment Authority, which one critic called a "rogue
agency," was unceremoniously dumped into a wing of county government.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors will continue to serve as the authority's board. But
county officials are "studying staffing needs" for the authority's
workload and are preparing a report on the agency's transfer to the
control of the county executive office, which is scheduled to be
presented at Tuesday's board meeting.</LD>
<TE>   "It's still preliminary," said Candy Haggard, a manager in the
county executive office, who declined to elaborate on the report.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps not coincidentally, Tuesday is also the day the Navy is
expected to announce its decision on how it will dispose of the
former base now that the airport plan is dead. Among its options is
to grant Irvine's request to annex the property, which received
supervisors' approval last week.</TE>
<TE>   Once the darling of the board's three pro-airport supervisors, the
authority was formed nearly two years ago to convert the 4,700-acre
base property into an airport capable of handling 28 million
passengers a year.</TE>
<TE>   Now, until the Navy announces its decision, the property's fate
and that of the agency's 29 employees are in limbo.</TE>
<TE>   Even Supervisor Chuck Smith, a staunch airport advocate, favors
moving oversight of the agency away from the board.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're not going to build an airport, it doesn't make sense to
keep [the agency] as a separate entity," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Once under the wing of the county executive office the agency
could be dissolved. If so, 23 of its 29 employees will probably
return to the departments they were initially borrowed from, Haggard
said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the remaining workers, at least three are contract employees:
Mark Mispagel, special counsel for El Toro; consultant Bob Peterson;
and Gary Simon, the authority's, $182,000-a-year executive director.</TE>
<TE>   Simon has alleged that the board violated his contract when it
voted 3 to 2 to transfer the agency, making him report to county CEO
Michael Schumacher instead of directly to the board.</TE>
<TE>   During a closed session that Simon called to discuss his job
performance last week, Simon reportedly told supervisors about the
breach, as he saw it. Anti-airport Supervisor Todd Spitzer told
Simon: "Gary, don't take it personally."</TE>
<TE>   "[But] it is," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   In that meeting, the board took no stand on Simon's performance.</TE>
<TE>   No issue has fueled such intense debate in the county as the
airport plan. Simon's agency was viewed either as a welcome planning
addition or the mechanism for destroying south county's quality of
life.</TE>
<TE>   "The authority's employees were not the architects of the airport,
they were the foot solders. And, unfortunately, the foot soldiers
take the worst of the battle," said Meg Waters, a spokeswoman for the
El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, a coalition of south county cities
that fought airport plans.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Eckles, the coalition's executive director, was more harsh,
saying the county agency bent rules and became a "rogue agency."</TE>
<TE>   The anti-airport coalition sued the county several times over the
county agency's efforts, ultimately costing the county nearly $1
million in attorney fees. The cases involved getting public documents
on airport planning that the county agency wanted to withhold, and an
injunction issued in January that ordered the county to stop using
public funds to promote an airport at El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   But the county agency has its defenders. Bruce Nestande, spokesman
for the Airport Working Group, which favors an airport, said the
agency and its employees were only carrying out their duties as
directed by the county and the voters, who approved an airport for
the base in 1994. A later voter-approved anti-airport initiative,
Measure F, was declared unconstitutional, leaving the original
airport vote the "law of the land," Nestande said.</TE>
<TE>   (Voters' most recent say, approving Measure W on March 5, rezoned
the property to preclude an airport.)</TE>
<TE>   Measure F, Nestande said, had "clearly spelled out that unless
there was a fatal flaw, that reuse of the base should be civilian
aviation," he said. "The [agency's] employees were hard workers."</TE>

<HD>4,000 Homes, No Schools in Sight</HD>
<DH>Education: State lacks funds for promised Tustin-Irvine
campuses. A fall bond issue may help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before deciding to buy her $441,000 home in Irvine, Lyann Collins
remembers driving through the development and seeing the sign
announcing that a new high school would open in the fall of 2003.</LD>
<LD>   The mother of four said the promise of a new school sealed her
decision to move into West Irvine, an upscale community with
manicured parks, community swimming pools and neatly groomed soccer
fields. Two years later, the sign remains but the promised opening
date has been erased.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm starting to panic," said Collins, whose oldest child is 10.
"The school might not be there when I need it."</LD>
<TE>   More than 4,000 homes have been built along the border of Irvine
and Tustin, communities where residents pay hundreds of dollars a
year to fund the new schools. But Arnold O. Beckman High School and
Hicks Canyon Elementary have yet to be built.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that although residents have paid enough to buy the
land, the state has run out of money to build the schools. The money
earmarked for Tustin Unified was shifted to help fund school work in
Los Angeles and other urban school districts.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say the situation in the Tustin and Irvine neighborhoods
reflects a statewide trend in which the state has been unable to meet
all the requests for funds to build or repair schools. There is a
backlog of $2.9 billion in requests for state money and only $450
million left of the 1998 state bond that funds school construction,
said Jim Bush, assistant director of school planning for the state
Department of Education.</TE>
<TE>   A new state bond will be on the November ballot, providing a fresh
flow of money if it passes</TE>
<TE>   Still, the situation for parents like Mellisa Winter, who bought
her West Irvine home with the impression that "exceptional schools"
would soon be built, has been frustrating.</TE>
<TE>   Winter said her two children must travel across town to Tustin
High School, a crowded campus where 18 portables provide some
classroom space. Other parents send children to Foothill High, where
21 portables are used. The schools are accommodating hundreds of
students from the new housing tracts, said Mark Eliot, Tustin Unified
School District's communications director.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very disappointing," Winter said. "I don't know that we
would have bought in this area if we would have known that the new
high school would not be built."</TE>
<TE>   Winter, Collins and others who live in upscale houses in West
Irvine, Northpark, Northpark Square and Tustin Ranch fall within a
Mello-Roos taxation district, meaning homeowners pay extra to
subsidize new schools.</TE>
<TE>   Collins said she pays at least $1,300 a year in Mello-Roos taxes,
meaning by the time the 30-year mortgage on the house is paid,
$39,000 will have been directed toward building local schools. The
state is supposed to match the funds to get the schools built, in
this case Beckman High and Hicks Canyon Elementary.</TE>
<TE>   The matching money was expected to come from the $6.7-billion
school bond approved by voters in 1998. Originally, the money was
available on a first-come, first-served basis.</TE>
<TE>   As with other suburban districts, Tustin "flourished" under this
approach, said Supt. Pete Gorman. With the ability to raise lots of
money with Mello-Roos districts, land could be bought, architects
hired and plans drawn much more quickly than in cash-strapped urban
areas.</TE>
<TE>   Change in Fund Rules Hurts Suburban Schools</TE>
<TE>   All that changed last year when the Los Angeles Unified School
District sued the state, asserting that the first-come, first-served
system was unfair for urban districts. Los Angeles Unified asked that
the funds be handed out first to districts with pressing needs such
as overcrowding and deteriorating schools.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, it has been harder for suburban schools to compete
with Los Angeles and other urban areas, said Brock Wagner, assistant
superintendent of business services for Tustin's district.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are out there with Los Angeles, L.A. will beat you every
single time," Wagner said. "They can always prove that they have
bigger problems than [we do]. It's like fighting Goliath; you are not
going to beat them."</TE>
<TE>   The new Irvine and Tustin neighborhoods raised $3.6 million in
Mello-Roos taxes last year. With that money, bonds were issued to buy
the land from the Irvine Co. for Beckman High and Hicks Canyon
Elementary. The cost of the two schools will be roughly $112 million,
half of which the state had agreed to pay. But, for now, the money is
just not there.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent meeting, Gorman tried to convince residents that there
are alternatives for getting the schools built.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin, like other districts, has its hopes pinned on a
$13-billion school bond, which will be on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The bond money would be distributed on a first-come, first-served
basis and would set aside $2.9 billion for schools with projects that
have been approved but remain unfunded. This would place the Tustin
district in a position to receive matching funds immediately, Bush
said.</TE>
<TE>   The district is also negotiating with the Irvine Co. to front the
money. The firm is receptive, said the company's Rich Elbaum.</TE>
<TE>   Although the company is "under no legal obligation to do so," it
is exploring ways to help the district begin construction, Elbaum
said.</TE>
<TE>   The district could also scale back the design of Beckman High
School, an option that doesn't go over with Collins and other
parents, who say they expect a first-rate school with a pool and
state-of-the-art gymnasium for the amount of taxes they are paying.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really hard to work up any sympathy for these people living
in their million-dollar homes and their manicured soccer fields,"
Collins conceded. "But every kid in here is imposing on a kid in
Tustin High."</TE>

<HD>Strip Club Donation Returned by Davis</HD>
<DH>Politics: Governor sends back $10,000 to owner of three
Southland topless bars after questions are raised. A campaign aide
says the money 'didn't pass the smell test.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis hasn't raised $43 million since taking office by
turning down many donors. But he's doing exactly that, returning a
$10,000 contribution from an Upland firm that owns three Southern
California strip joints.</LD>
<LD>   The governor's campaign aides made the decision Saturday after The
Times asked about the donation from Manta Management Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Campaign spokesman Roger Salazar said the contribution, dated
April 3 and made when Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-New York) was in
California to help Davis raise money, "didn't pass the smell test."</LD>
<TE>   Salazar said that Davis has a campaign worker who vets all
donations, and that the governor has returned other checks, but
usually before the campaign cashes them. Such decisions are made
without a public announcement. In this instance, the check simply
slipped past the screener, Salazar said.</TE>
<TE>   Manta owns three clubs, including the Flesh Club in San
Bernardino, where city officials won a court order barring topless
acts in the mid-1990s, only to have it lifted in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in 2000, police made several prostitution-related arrests at
the Flesh Club after undercover investigators paid women working at
the club to perform sex acts on one another.</TE>
<TE>   In October, a state Court of Appeal threw out the charges,
concluding that prostitution only applies when the person being paid
actually performs with the person making the payment.</TE>
<TE>   "For better or worse," the appellate court said, "our society has
developed a tolerance for a wide variety of exchanges of sex for
money.... As objectionable as the performances are in this case, we
are loath to find a public policy requirement that the acts be
criminalized under existing law."</TE>
<TE>   Roger Jon Diamond, the Santa Monica lawyer who represents Manta
and arranged for the donation, said that despite the governor's
decision to return the money, he still plans to support Davis'
reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "I respect whatever decision they're making," he said. "There was
nothing improper."</TE>
<TE>   Diamond said he had asked that Manta's owner, Randy Welty, make
the donation as a "favor," and that he and Welty support Davis
because of his environmental positions.</TE>
<TE>   Diamond said that he has known the governor for years, but that
Welty and Davis have no connection and Welty didn't attend the
dinner.</TE>
<TE>   "It never dawned on me there would be a problem," Diamond said.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Flint, a spokesman for Davis' Republican challenger, Bill
Simon Jr., used the opportunity to criticize Davis' fund-raising, and
noted that the governor likely would not have returned the money if
The Times had not questioned its source.</TE>
<TE>   "While he's at it, he ought to return the nearly $200,000 he took
from Enron and Arthur Andersen," Flint said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has rejected calls from Republicans to return money from
Enron Corp., the bankrupt energy trader, and its accounting firm,
Arthur Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   But the governor said he no longer takes money from many firms
directly involved in last year's energy crisis. He also has made a
practice of refusing tobacco industry money.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic incumbent does, however, accept donations from a
range of other industries with business before the state, from oil
and telecommunications firms to gambling and alcohol interests.</TE>

<HD>Officials Warned Not to Libel Parks</HD>
<DH>Politics: In the face of the police chief's possible
litigation, city attorneys urge the use of caution in comments about
him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks considers whether to sue
the city for denying him a second five-year term, the city's
attorneys are weighing Parks' chances and warning officials to watch
what they say about the chief.</LD>
<LD>   Anticipating that Parks might opt for legal action--a course that
his predecessor, Willie L. Williams, pursued--the city attorney's
office has sent a confidential memo to the mayor, members of the City
Council and the Police Commission. In it, the city lawyers urge
officials to refrain from making comments that could lead to
potential liability against the city.</LD>
<LD>   "Recognizing the need for a vigorous public debate about an issue
of this importance, our office believes that you should be aware that
even when discussing a public official, statements made about the
public official, if shown to be false and made with malice, may
result in liability," Chief Assistant City Atty. Patricia V. Tubert
wrote. "Therefore, if you do comment on the chief, please refrain
from making comments that could lead to potential liability against
the city of Los Angeles or against you as an individual."</LD>
<TE>   So far, council members and others have largely held their
tongues, though Police Commission President Rick Caruso has
questioned the chief's honesty. Parks' lawyer, Gloria Allred, has
raised other legal objections to the process that resulted in the
chief's bid for a second term being turned down. Parks is expected to
announce today what options he intends to pursue.</TE>
<TE>   "I strongly believe he has rights that he can assert," Allred
said. "But it's up to him. There are many options, not just one."</TE>
<TE>   Allred has laid out the areas in which she believes Parks was
wronged in a six-page memo to the city attorney's office. In her
letter, sent as the council was voting Wednesday to uphold the Police
Commission action against Parks, Allred alleged that Parks'
constitutional rights were violated in a number of instances.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Allred said, Parks was denied a chance to have his
attorney present during a nine-hour interview with members of the
Police Commission. The proceedings were also held behind closed
doors, even though Parks asked that the discussions be held in the
open.</TE>
<TE>   "Chief Parks made it clear that he wanted to waive any right of
confidentiality that he might have and that he wanted to have a
public hearing," according to the letter. "This right was denied to
him and the commission chose to conduct its proceedings in secret
closed session, even though [the city attorney's office] advised the
commission in writing that it could conduct the hearing openly, if it
chose to do so."</TE>
<TE>   Allred also accused members of the commission of meeting secretly,
without public announcement, during the course of their
deliberations. If true, the actions would constitute a violation of
California's open meetings law, she said. Allred's contention that
Parks has been defamed is built largely around the comments of
Caruso, who said in an interview that Parks tried to mislead the
commission by submitting an earlier performance evaluation that he
knew had not been finalized by the previous Police Commission. Parks
has denied the allegation.</TE>
<TE>   "Pursuant to the federal Constitution, Chief Parks cannot be
deprived of a significant liberty interest without due process of
law," according to Allred's letter. "A liberty interest is implicated
when the city or commission acts in a manner which adversely affects
Chief Parks' good name."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Nate Holden, one of Parks' strongest supporters, said
he is urging the chief to file a suit along those lines.</TE>
<TE>   "At the very least, he's got to protect his good name," Holden
said.</TE>
<TE>   One question about that approach, however, involves whether Parks
was in fact entitled to due process. The chief does not have a
contract with the city, and the commission's decision to deny him a
second term did not constitute discipline or firing. Rather, the City
Charter provides for a chief to serve for five years, and for Parks,
that term ends in August.</TE>
<TE>   Several council members and legal scholar Erwin Chemerinsky noted
that under the City Charter, the police chief has no right to a
second term. Chemerinsky, a constitutional law professor at USC who
helped write the City Charter, said bluntly that he believes Parks'
claims are "nonsense."</TE>
<TE>   "The way the charter is written gives him no reasonable
expectation for a second term," Chemerinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney George Kieffer, who also helped draft the new charter,
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "The Police Commission, as head of the department, must have the
power to change a chief who does not have their confidence," Kieffer
said. "There is no presumption of a second term.... Under this kind
of standard, it would be very difficult to have some claim against
the city."</TE>
<TE>   Chemerinsky said Parks also would face an uphill battle to prove
that he was defamed. The chief would have to show that Caruso knew
that he was acting with "reckless disregard for the truth,"
Chemerinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the law protects officials from defamation suits if
their comments are made during an official proceeding, which city
lawyers could argue was the case with Caruso.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it would be possible for Parks to prove actual
malice," Chemerinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the legal merits of Parks' case are political
considerations.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, council members eager to smooth the departure of
then-Chief Williams seized upon his pending claim against the city to
give him a buyout.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, Williams had taken action against the city after
parts of his confidential personnel file were published by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Williams argued that the city had improperly "released" those
materials, even though he never established how the documents were
obtained by the paper.</TE>
<TE>   Although legal experts said his case had little merit, council
members and then-Mayor Richard Riordan approved a $375,000 settlement
to end the controversy over Williams' rejected reappointment.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss said he doubts the council will vote to give
Parks money.</TE>
<TE>   "The presentation that has been made so far has not been
convincing that he is owed either money or a second term," Weiss
said.</TE>

<HD>Hometown Remembers Slain Journalist</HD>
<DH>Daniel Pearl: Hundreds gather at his high school to share
grief and admiration for the Wall Street Journal reporter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two months after his murder was confirmed, Daniel Pearl was
memorialized at his former high school for his ordinary upbringing
and extraordinary accomplishments.</LD>
<LD>   Family, school friends and a former principal came to share their
grief and express their admiration for the slain journalist at a
gathering of 300 people Sunday afternoon in a Birmingham High School
auditorium in Van Nuys.</LD>
<LD>   The 38-year-old Pearl disappeared Jan. 23 in Karachi while working
on a story about Islamic extremists in Pakistan. A videotape showing
his murder was obtained by the U.S. Consulate in Karachi on Feb. 21.</LD>
<TE>   Robert Massing described a 12th-grade English class he had with
Pearl in which the future Wall Street Journal reporter was frantic
over an essay assignment.</TE>
<TE>   "Times like that I wanted to be Danny Pearl more than anything in
the world," Massing said. "There was so much depth. He had so much to
say."</TE>
<TE>   Massing said Pearl made an idealistic choice to become a
journalist. He was driven not by money or fame, Massing said, but by
the question, "How can we make the world a better place?"</TE>
<TE>   Pearl grew up in Encino under circumstances similar to those of
people who attended Sunday's ceremony. His principal at Lanai Road
Elementary School in Encino credits Pearl's success to his public
schooling.</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of the many good guys," said Larry Marquardt, a
retired principal. "He is gone but not forgotten. His name will live
on."</TE>
<TE>   Amy Scholder, another member of Pearl's 1981 high school
graduation class, read an excerpt of Antoine de Saint-Exupery's novel
"The Little Prince." She said a French teacher of theirs felt the
book was perfect for Pearl's memorial because it's a "story of an
idealist who left the world too soon."</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's family sat in the front row of the auditorium, listening
intently. Pearl's father, Judea, explained to the crowd that
communities such as the one before him have helped the family cope.
"One whose legacy keeps growing is not exactly dead," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Pearl's younger sister, Michelle, said he was a role model
who was quick to give advice. In a postcard he sent to her before she
began high school, he asked her whether she was on a sports team. He
had played soccer and violin, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you on a team yet?" he wrote. "You better be. You'll thank me
later when you realize how stale the rest of high school is."</TE>
<TE>   Birmingham High ninth-grader Zachary Lopez, who will take his
first journalism class next year, said he was glued to the news after
Pearl disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a person I look up to," Zachary said.</TE>
<TE>   Eleventh-grader Meganne Hoisington, who is president of the
school's honor society for high school journalists, was shocked by
Pearl's death.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't realize writing can be dangerous," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Michael McClish, a math teacher at Birmingham, attended the
ceremony with his family. He said he came away with a feeling that
Pearl was an "ordinary guy who grew up in the Valley and tried to do
something."</TE>
<TE>   The memorial at Birmingham High was delayed several weeks to
confirm the attendance of elected officials, said its principal,
Doris Lasiter. Another ceremony was held in March at the Skirball
Cultural Center for friends and family to mourn Pearl's death.</TE>
<TE>   Among officials at the high school Sunday were state Sen. Richard
Alarcon (D-Sylmar), Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky and
Los Angeles City Councilman Dennis Zine.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Offers TV Classes to Santa Ana School</HD>
<DH>Education: 'Plaza" plan would let parents take evening
courses using a Spanish satellite feed from Mexico City. Approval is
likely.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine two Santa Ana classrooms where students study with their
teachers by day. At night, their parents occupy the same desks,
taking vocational or English classes by satellite from Mexico on a
big-screen TV.</LD>
<LD>   That's the aim of a pilot program proposed at Carr Intermediate
School in partnership with the Mexican government. Using a study plan
and software developed in Mexico, parents could learn high school
basics and English at night.</LD>
<LD>   While the Mexican government has worked with California school
districts before--including donating thousands of
textbooks--vocational training in Spanish goes a step further.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to be very attentive to the issues facing the Mexican
population in the United States," said Melba Pria, director of the
Mexican Foreign Ministry's Mexicans Abroad program, during a visit
last week to the Santa Ana middle school. "This is a way to share a
program we began in Mexico and help school officials in the United
States integrate adults into the school campus."</TE>
<TE>   Mexican immigrants, many from rural areas, often leave school
before sixth grade. They come to the United States to earn money and,
once here, realize that they need more education to get better jobs
and to help their children excel.</TE>
<TE>   Because an estimated one-sixth of all Mexican nationals live in
the United States, according to the Mexican government, Mexican
President Vicente Fox is putting a new emphasis on those north of the
border. The Mexican government estimates there are 100 million
Mexicans in Mexico and 20 million in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The experiment to create "community plazas" is underway in 18
American schools, including one in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "Plaza" refers to a concept rather than a place. The word is used
in Mexico to refer to the town center, the heart of a city. Program
organizers say they hope to use that image to create a sense of
community among immigrants who may have little formal education and
are often intimidated in adult vocational training classes.</TE>
<TE>   "In the United States, teachers say, 'Come on, you can do it.'
People in the United States feel directed. They respond. But many
Mexicans do not," said Sofia Orozco Aguirre, deputy director of
education for Mexicans Abroad. "Most Mexicans leave Mexico to make a
living.... Education is not a priority. In Mexico, you do not make
more money if you have more education.</TE>
<TE>   "The materials are in Spanish and are designed for adults in this
situation."</TE>
<TE>   A Nebraska meat-packing plant is working to set up such a learning
facility for its employees, Orozco Aguirre said.</TE>
<TE>   Other Santa Ana campuses are considering adopting the program, as
are school officials in Riverside and Huntington Park.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Bryan, director of English-language development and
bilingual education for the Santa Ana Unified School District, said
the satellite classes will help children with their Spanish-language
skills and their ability to learn English.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like to see this in every school in our district," he
said. "Every school has immigrant parents, and this is designed to
help them."</TE>
<TE>   Bryan said the district was already remodeling Carr and will
designate two classrooms for the plaza. "This is in the beginning
stages right now, so we need to fully develop a plan," he said. "I do
believe it is going to happen, though."</TE>
<TE>   The campus was selected for the pilot program in part because more
than half the school's 1,750 students are learning English. Also, the
school comprises the sixth, seventh and eighth grades, a level at
which parents with limited education become concerned that they can
no longer help their children with lessons, said Evangelina
Castaneda, president of Carr's parent-teacher-student organization.</TE>
<TE>   Castaneda, whose 12-year-old son Miguel is at Carr, said of the
plaza proposal: "It's magnificent. We've never seen anything like
this. We're happy the two governments are working together, and it
affirms parents' involvement."</TE>
<TE>   For the Carr plaza, Santa Ana Unified must come up with the money
for computers. Mexico pays for satellite connections--about $7,500
for each plaza--and provides a curriculum that is introduced to
students through satellite programming.</TE>
<TE>   Trustee Nativo V. Lopez said he believes the school board will do
everything possible to make the plaza work at Carr and expand the
program to other schools.</TE>
<TE>   "What all board members agree on is that the more educated our
parents are, the better off our students are," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Details of how the plaza would work--including staffing,
equipment, funding, the frequency of classes, student eligibility and
when classes could begin--are still being worked out, district
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Development of additional plazas would depend on the availability
of space, Bryan said.</TE>
<TE>   Carr's principal, Angel Gallardo, expressed confidence that the
program would work well at the southwest Santa Ana campus, where
parental involvement is high. Parents successfully lobbied for a
year-round schedule and student uniforms in recent years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel that anything that helps parents will help our students,"
Gallardo said. "If it takes the Mexican government to help, so be
it."</TE>

<LD>Sacramento--Palookaville North.</LD>
<LD>   Roger Salazar is the press secretary for Gov. Gray Davis'
campaign, and in his latest artillery round to state political
reporters, he scolded Bill Simon's political strategist, Sal Russo,
for gushing over the Probolsky Poll showing Simon six points ahead of
Davis.</LD>
<LD>   "Who? What do you take us for, Sal?" Salazar asked. "A bunch of
palookas?"</LD>
<TE>   The poll was taken by Adam Probolsky of Costa Mesa, who at the
tender age of 28 already has 10 years of political barnacles on his
hull, six of them in polling.</TE>
<TE>   Probolsky leaped to the defense of palookas--Websterized as clumsy
or oafish fellows--and said he released his poll of 825 Californians
at a Sacramento dinner with Republican legislators and lobbyists to
get some publicity. Guess what? It worked.</TE>
<TE>   Simon Says: Not Much (About His Taxes)</TE>
<TE>   Post offices around California sought to sweeten the bitter pill
of April 15 with free doughnuts, shoulder rubs and, in Santa Monica,
a little uncritical affection with dogs from L.A.'s Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals--like Chocolate the lab, delivering
chocolate kisses to Sally Nandau.</TE>
<TE>   The day didn't go down so well for Republican gubernatorial guy
Bill Simon, who spent tax week on the defensive about what taxes he
paid and why he wasn't sharing his income tax statements, as other
pols--notably his opponent, Gray Davis--often do. His campaign tried
to settle the matter with a statement that last year,
multimillionaire Simon paid taxes that "totaled in the millions of
dollars." Not including the stamp to mail it, of course.</TE>
<TE>   State's Horn of Plenty Gets Help From Chile</TE>
<TE>   The California Cornucopia couldn't pour out enough of the green
goods on time.</TE>
<TE>   So at last week's Host Breakfast, an annual gala courtesy of the
California Chamber of Commerce, the centerpiece, as usual, was a
large clay pot filled with produce at each table.</TE>
<TE>   At each place was a sack so people could take home
fruit-of-the-earth bags of grapes and strawberries and the like.</TE>
<TE>   But much of this year's largess was from Chile, where it's high
harvest season.</TE>
<TE>   The event used to be held in late summer, when just about
everything in California was ripe, including Californians. But the
chamber had a hard time luring people to Sacramento because of the
wretched seasonal heat.</TE>
<TE>   So they moved the wingding to spring, when the temperature stays
reliably in two digits. Chamber executive Fred Main patriotically
strove to explain away the imported fruit--it simply underscores how
cosmopolitan California is.</TE>
<TE>   Congress Finds It's So Hard to Say Goodbye</TE>
<TE>   So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, goodbye ... and adios.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio Democrat James A. Traficant, convicted of felony racketeering
and political corruption just days ago, still won't quit his
congressional seat.</TE>
<TE>   So Orange County Democratic Rep. Loretta Sanchez introduced a
resolution last week calling for his expulsion. "I'm tired of hearing
that the American public is losing faith in its elected officials,"
Sanchez said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The House's Democratic leadership is with her all the way, calling
on Mr. T. to resign--no dice. Sanchez's resolution was automatically
referred to the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct,
which will consider lodging disciplinary actions against Traficant.</TE>
<TE>   Restaurant Advised to Order Up New Pictures</TE>
<TE>   Downtown L.A.'s Palm restaurant invited the city's high and
mighty--from billionaire Eli Broad to Dodger-for-life Tommy Lasorda,
attorney Johnnie Cochran to City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo--to sign
their caricatures that hang on the walls of the power lunchroom.</TE>
<TE>   But Doug Dowie, the top of the PR heap at the uber-agency
Fleishman-Hillard, questions some of the choices. He wondered in a
letter to the general manager why Hubert Humphrey, LBJ's vice
president, the man Richard Nixon beat to the White House 34 years
ago, is on the wall.</TE>
<TE>   As for the sketches of political civil servants Laura Chick,
Dennis Zine and Steve Cooley (L.A.'s controller, a council member and
the D.A., respectively), Dowie puzzled, "what do these people have in
common except for the fact that they can't afford your prices?"</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody," Dowie suggested, "ought to get a real list of power
brokers downtown--and get pictures up there quick before you guys go
broke."</TE>
<TE>   For himself, Dowie confessed in a P.S., "I spend so much money at
the [Pacific] Dining Car [a much older political gab-and-grub
restaurant], they're painting my picture on the side of the
building."</TE>
<TE>   This Declaration Left Some Things Unsaid</TE>
<TE>   Well yes, that's what they said, but there was more to it than
that.</TE>
<TE>   A press release from Republican Assemblyman Dennis Hollingsworth
about his bill to require high school competency tests in such vital
American documents as the Declaration of Independence and the
Gettysburg Address quoted a California Federation of Teachers
representative telling a hearing, "We don't feel that it is essential
for students to know these documents."</TE>
<TE>   The whole truth, objected Mike Weimer, the CFT's legislative rep
who was the testifier at the hearing, is that "those documents are
already part of a state standard" on a mandatory test that California
will be giving in a couple of years' time, "so they're already
covered." They are not part of the state high school exit exam, which
is heavy on math and reading, not social studies.</TE>
<TE>   Fourscore and seven test points ago....</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An off-duty Los Angeles police officer driving north on the Harbor
Freeway was shot Sunday in both legs by the occupants of a
Mercedes-Benz, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The unidentified officer, in a pickup truck, returned gunfire with
the four men in the other vehicle before he pulled off the freeway at
Florence Avenue for medical attention, Officer Don Cox said.</LD>
<LD>   The officer was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was in stable
condition Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   The motive for the shooting was unclear.</TE>
<TE>   It occurred about 5:30 p.m., shortly after the officer made a
transition from the westbound Century Freeway to the Harbor Freeway,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   "He observed the Mercedes driving erratically in his rear-view
mirror," Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   "The car pulled up alongside him on the right, and then shots were
fired. Then there was an exchange of gunfire until he got to the
Florence offramp."</TE>
<TE>   Police described the vehicle used by the shooters as a gold,
mid-1990s Mercedes S500 series with tinted rear windows.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators say the vehicle may have bullet holes.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators closed the northbound Harbor Freeway around
Manchester Avenue shortly after 6 p.m. to check for evidence.</TE>

<HD>State to Reconsider Labor Deal</HD>
<DH>Politics: Business leaders cry foul over Davis
administration contract that restricts the use of outside firms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Two years after voters decided to speed up transportation projects
through more public-private partnerships, the Davis administration
has agreed to a labor contract that restricts the use of outside
firms and thus, critics say, undermines the initiative.</LD>
<LD>   An outcry from the state's business community has prompted the
administration to reconsider the labor deal with state engineers and
architects.</LD>
<LD>   The dispute over the contract is the latest in a two-decade battle
between public and private employees for the design and engineering
work on billions of dollars worth of state transportation projects.</LD>
<TE>   Voters handed the private firms a key victory in 2000 by approving
Proposition 35, which was supposed to make it easier for state and
local agencies to contract with private firms to accelerate
construction projects ranging from schools to highways.</TE>
<TE>   But the labor agreement with Professional Engineers in California
Government, the union that represents 11,000 engineers, architects
and land surveyors employed by state agencies, renews the skirmish.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement includes a provision that essentially requires the
state to use government employees rather than private firms in years
when workloads do not increase.</TE>
<TE>   An exception would be made if the state wanted to contract with
private firms to perform specialized services.</TE>
<TE>   If the California Department of Transportation's workload were to
increase, the state could contract out up to half of the growth.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the deal, which include the California Chamber of
Commerce and the private firms behind Proposition 35, fear that the
new restrictions would slow the delivery of transportation projects.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question Californians want transportation projects
accelerated as rapidly as possible," said Bill Hauck, president of
the California Business Roundtable.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears to me that this could and probably would have the
effect of going in the opposite direction.... I can't imagine that
the governor would be supportive of this."</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks has asked
legislative lawyers to determine whether the labor agreement,
contained in SB 1213 by state Sen. Dede Alpert (D-Coronado), is
legal.</TE>
<TE>   Cox said the lawyers advised his office earlier this month that
the agreement's restrictions on outside contracts represent an
unconstitutional violation of Proposition 35.</TE>
<TE>   "Our folks will not vote for it, because it undermines Proposition
35," Cox said. "We need to uphold the will of the people."</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans is taking another look at the deal as a result of the
questions, said Marty Morgenstern, director of the state Department
of Personnel Administration.</TE>
<TE>   "The language on the contracting out is something that Caltrans
worked on rather than us," Morgenstern said. "They felt this change
in the law met our needs and was appropriate and allowed the
department flexibility on a permanent basis."</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans spokesman Dennis Trujillo said that work on $7 billion
worth of transportation contracts is underway and that 20% of the
activity is being contracted out.</TE>
<TE>   "This [labor agreement] will allow us to contract out at the same
level," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Blanning of Professional Engineers in California Government
emphasized that the agreement also allows the state to contract out
additional work if, despite hiring efforts, Caltrans is unable to
deliver transportation projects on schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Blanning said the deal strikes a balance between Californians'
desire to have public and private employees working on highway
projects. He also said Proposition 35 does not require the state to
contract out.</TE>
<TE>   Union members, he added, are in the process of ratifying the
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "We proposed and ultimately agreed with the governor on a flexible
formula for the Legislature and the governor to allocate jobs for
staffing and contracting," Blanning said.</TE>
<TE>   "Contracting out," he added, "is for peaks, not for regular work."</TE>
<TE>   The union's campaign contributions records show that it gave Gov.
Gray Davis more than $130,000 from 1999 through 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The private firms behind Proposition 35 say the measure gave the
state the right to contract out in any year to move projects
along--not only when Caltrans' workload is on the rise.</TE>
<TE>   If the restrictions became law, they contend, they could prevent
future governors from contracting with outside firms as they saw fit.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't always be the last one hired and first one fired," said
Gene Erbin, a lobbyist representing the private firms. "We need a
dependable, reliable and predictable relationship with Caltrans."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Markuson of the Consulting Engineers and Land Surveyors of
California, a group representing about 17,000 private engineers and
land surveyors, predicted that within three years Caltrans would have
no authority to contract out for anything other than specialized
services, which include underwater work performed on bridges.</TE>
<TE>   Markuson based his conclusion on Caltrans' future workload and an
anticipated reduction in federal transportation funding.</TE>
<TE>   The labor contract bill is awaiting a hearing in the Assembly
Committee on Public Employees, Retirement and Social Security. No
date has been set.</TE>

<HD>Coast Highway Becoming Road to Recognition for Veterans</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vietnam's Highway 1 runs the length of the country, from Hanoi to Ho
Chi Minh City.</LD>
<LD>   California's Highway 1 runs nearly the length of the state,
connecting many of the military bases where soldiers trained in the
1960s and 1970s before heading off to fight in Southeast Asia.</LD>
<LD>   The two roads are thousands of miles apart but for some Vietnam
veterans are forever linked.</LD>
<TE>   "We flew over it; we bombed it," Oxnard resident Dennis Hartman,
55, said of Vietnam's Highway 1. "But when I was in the country, and
when I thought of Highway 1, I thought of the Pacific Coast Highway.
Then I'd think, 'What am I doing here? What are we doing here?'"</TE>
<TE>   Now, county by county, activists are moving to designate
California 1 as a memorial to the 350,000 Californians who served in
the Vietnam War.</TE>
<TE>   State lawmakers later this spring will consider designating the
Ventura County portion of PCH, from the county line west of Malibu
through Oxnard, as Ventura County Vietnam Veterans Memorial Highway.
The route passes Naval Base Ventura County and Coast Guard and Air
National Guard stations.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Tony Strickland (R-Moorpark), who was born at the
former Ft. Ord Army base in Monterey, drafted the resolution at the
request of Rich Camacho, president of Vietnam Veterans of Ventura
County.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a way of telling the vets in Ventura County, 'Thank
you. We may not have a big memorial for you, but at least we have a
highway for you,'" Camacho said. "For other Vietnam veterans who are
traveling, it makes them feel welcome here."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Assemblyman George Nakano (D-Torrance) carried similar
legislation at the request of the Redondo Beach chapter of the
Vietnam Veterans of America. Several signposts mark the Los Angeles
County Vietnam Veterans Memorial Highway from Long Beach to Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   If the Ventura County effort succeeds, as is expected, the
campaign would continue to other coastal counties, said Hartman,
president of the Santa Barbara chapter of the Vietnam Veterans of
America.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Tom Harman (R-Huntington Beach), who served two years
in the Army in the 1960s, said he would support such an effort in
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "In every county you go to, you'll find Vietnam veterans who would
be delighted to see these signs erected," Nakano said. "It's a way of
saying, 'Thank you for serving our country.'"</TE>
<TE>   Despite the hostile homecoming many Vietnam veterans received
three decades ago, more than 1,000 memorials to that war have sprung
up, said Marc Leepson, who runs the memorial clearinghouse for the
Vietnam Veterans of America.</TE>
<TE>   A few cities honored soldiers with memorial plaques during the
war, but most government-sanctioned projects followed the 1982
dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. California
may have had one of the earliest bridge dedications. State
transportation officials said a bridge along Interstate 5 near
Sacramento was dedicated to service members in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't clear how many hundreds of miles of memorial highways cut
across the United States or how many states have memorial bridges.
Neither Leepson nor transportation officials could provide an
official count.</TE>
<TE>   But the list of states adopting Vietnam Veterans Memorial Highway
designations has grown steadily over the last 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, Vermont dedicated a 138-mile strip of Interstate 89,
which passes by a memorial rest stop in the town of Sharon. The
highway was traveled by draft resisters on their way to Canada.</TE>
<TE>   In Pennsylvania, a stretch of Interstate 95 around Philadelphia
carries the designation. Legislatures in Delaware, Maryland, New
York, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Texas also have adopted
designations in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Road designations have advantages over monuments. They're cheaper
and quicker to install and probably seen by more people. In
California, veterans signposts will be funded by private donations.</TE>
<TE>   "Because we're such a mobile state, maybe this is the best way to
remind people of the sacrifices that these then-young men made," said
Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara), a co-sponsor of
the Ventura County legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard resident Hartman, who served in Vietnam from 1969 to 1971
as a rescue and recovery crew chief for the Air Force, said memorial
roads take on a special meaning in California: "Driving a car, here
in this state, symbolizes freedom."</TE>

<DH>Recognition: Bill would designate a stretch of California 1
to honor war veterans.</DH>

<LD>Vietnam's Highway 1 runs the length of the country, from Hanoi to Ho
Chi Minh City.</LD>
<LD>   California's Highway 1 runs nearly the length of the state,
connecting many of the military bases where soldiers trained in the
1960s and 1970s before heading off to fight in Southeast Asia.</LD>
<LD>   The two roads are thousands of miles apart but for some Vietnam
veterans are forever linked.</LD>
<TE>   "We flew over it; we bombed it," Oxnard resident Dennis Hartman,
55, said of Vietnam's Highway 1. "But when I was in the country, and
when I thought of Highway 1, I thought of the Pacific Coast Highway.
Then I'd think, 'What am I doing here? What are we doing here?'"</TE>
<TE>   Now, county by county, activists are moving to designate
California 1 as a memorial to the 350,000 Californians who served in
the Vietnam War.</TE>
<TE>   State lawmakers later this spring will consider designating the
Ventura County portion of PCH, from the county line west of Malibu
through Oxnard, as Ventura County Vietnam Veterans Memorial Highway.
The route passes Naval Base Ventura County and Coast Guard and Air
National Guard stations.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Tony Strickland (R-Moorpark), who was born at the
former Fort Ord Army base in Monterey, drafted the resolution at the
request of Rich Camacho, president of Vietnam Veterans of Ventura
County.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a way of telling the vets in Ventura County, 'Thank
you. We may not have a big memorial for you, but at least we have a
highway for you,'" Camacho said. "For other Vietnam veterans who are
traveling, it makes them feel welcome here."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Assemblyman George Nakano (D-Torrance) carried similar
legislation at the request of the Redondo Beach chapter of the
Vietnam Veterans of America. Several signposts mark the Los Angeles
County Vietnam Veterans Memorial Highway from Long Beach to Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   If the Ventura County effort succeeds, as is expected, the
campaign would continue to other coastal counties, said Hartman,
president of the Santa Barbara chapter of the Vietnam Veterans of
America.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Tom Harman (R-Huntington Beach), who served two years
in the Army in the 1960s, said he would support such an effort in
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "In every county you go to, you'll find Vietnam veterans who would
be delighted to see these signs erected," Nakano said. "It's a way of
saying, 'Thank you for serving our country.'"</TE>
<TE>   Despite the hostile homecoming many Vietnam veterans received
three decades ago, more than 1,000 memorials to that war have sprung
up, said Marc Leepson, who runs the memorial clearinghouse for the
Vietnam Veterans of America.</TE>
<TE>   A few cities honored soldiers with memorial plaques during the
war, but most government-sanctioned projects followed the 1982
dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   California may have had one of the earliest bridge dedications.
State transportation officials said a bridge along Interstate 5 near
Sacramento was dedicated to service members in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't clear how many hundreds of miles of memorial highways cut
across the United States or how many states have memorial bridges.
But the list of states adopting Vietnam Veterans Memorial Highway
designations has grown steadily over the past 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, Vermont dedicated a 138-mile strip of Interstate 89,
which passes by a memorial rest stop in the town of Sharon. The
highway was traveled by draft resisters on their way to Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New York, North Carolina,
Oklahoma and Texas have adopted designations in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Road designations have advantages over monuments. They're cheaper
and quicker to install and probably seen by more people. In
California, veterans signposts will be funded by private donations.</TE>
<TE>   "Because we're such a mobile state, maybe this is the best way to
remind people of the sacrifices that these then-young men made," said
Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara), a co-sponsor of
the Ventura County legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard resident Hartman, who served in Vietnam from 1969 to 1971
as a rescue and recovery crew chief for the Air Force, said memorial
roads take on a special meaning in California: "Driving a car, here
in this state, symbolizes freedom."</TE>

<LD>A broken water main at the Los Angeles Times Orange County edition in
Costa Mesa set off fire alarms in commercial buildings in the city's
north end Sunday, fire officials said.</LD>
<LD>   A 14-inch pipe that fed the Times' fire-suppression system burst,
damaging the newspaper's plant on Sunflower Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   The pressure surge that broke the pipe triggered fire alarms
elsewhere, starting at 3:48 a.m., Costa Mesa Fire Capt. Ron Cloe
said.</LD>
<TE>   "For a few minutes we had every rig in our city running to fire
alarms," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Within an eight-minute period, the Fire Department reported nine
alarms, primarily from buildings on Bear Street, Bristol Street and
South Coast Drive, Cloe said.</TE>
<TE>   The rupture was near the cafeteria and flooded a large area. No
damage estimate had been made Sunday.</TE>

<HD>Anchoring Family Life</HD>
<DH>Support: Courses teach spouses of Navy officers how to
navigate the difficulties of living in a military household.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>In the old Navy the adage was: If the Navy wanted you to have a wife,
it would have issued you one.</LD>
<LD>   But now the Navy realizes that a happy home life can make for a
more productive enlisted sailor or officer.</LD>
<LD>   With the Navy concerned about keeping enough officers and senior
enlisted personnel to fill key jobs, concern over family life is
increasing too.</LD>
<TE>   And so on Sunday, a number of Navy support groups held a seminar
for Navy spouses titled "Charting Your Own Course." But, because
there were no husbands present, it could easily have been called a
School for Navy Wives.</TE>
<TE>   Several dozen wives of new officers were tutored in the
complexities of raising children in a military environment, coping
with constant moves, juggling your career and his career, and
understanding the arcane details of fitness reports and selection
boards that can make or break a military career.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish they had something like this when my husband was an
ensign," said Sandi Solem, whose husband is Capt. Craig Solem,
commanding officer of the amphibious assault ship Belleau Wood.</TE>
<TE>   The days when spouses were seen as nuisances are gone, of course,
and "Charting" is one of a variety of efforts to help spouses and
children of active-duty military personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, the Navy began a weeklong course for spouses at
its school for prospective commanding officers at Newport, R.I. A
similar course is available for the spouses of senior enlisted
sailors.</TE>
<TE>   "Charting" was the idea of Sarah Fargo, wife of Adm. Tom Fargo,
commander of the Navy's Pacific Fleet, headquartered at Pearl Harbor.
Organizers hope to persuade the Navy to make a "Charting" course, or
something like it, available at other duty stations.</TE>
<TE>   Two-thirds of Navy spouses have jobs outside the home. What that
means is that there is less opportunity to learn the Navy ropes by
talking to other spouses.</TE>
<TE>   "We're the old folks," said Tricia Marshall, whose husband is Rear
Adm. Bill Marshall. "We learned by going to the wives' club and
getting on-the-job training. But now many spouses have their own busy
careers. We want to help them learn that it's not just a job for
their husband; it's a lifestyle for the entire family."</TE>
<TE>   In Navy families, two of the toughest periods are when the
spouse's ship departs for a long deployment and--odd as it may
seem--when the ship returns.</TE>
<TE>   "You become very self-sufficient when they deploy," said Betsy
Antanitus, whose husband is Rear Adm. David Antanitus. "You have to
learn to relinquish some control, to make your spouse feel welcome
and needed. If you can do that, you're a successful Navy wife."</TE>
<TE>   Moving is a constant in military life--and not likely to change.</TE>
<TE>   "I promise that during your career we're going to ask you to do
something just when you don't want to do it," Rear Adm. Ham Tallent
told the group.</TE>
<TE>   Promotion in the Navy is based on competition, Tallent said. An
assignment that might look exciting or be in a nice place to live
might hurt your husband's career because it does not provide a "break
out" experience that will impress the officers who decide promotions,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Resist the urge to make a fuss over a relocation, Tallent said.
"What do you want to fire your silver bullet on?" he asked.
Translation: The ability to refuse a move is very limited and should
be based on a very good reason.</TE>
<TE>   Solem said that in 25 years of marriage the couple has lived in 14
homes in 10 locations across the world. Her No. 1 piece of advice for
young Navy spouses: Learn to "embrace change."</TE>
<TE>   Su-Yen Kuhn said she met her husband--Lt. David Kuhn, a
submariner--when both were students at Stanford. "It was fun going to
ROTC dances, but I knew nothing about what life would be like in the
Navy," she said. "It grows on you."</TE>
<TE>   In five years, the couple has moved four times. Now she offers
financial consulting to military families.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall said her college-age daughter wrote a poem entitled "This
Navy Life" in which she listed her top memories of childhood as Navy
jets overhead and packing tape being used for yet another family
move.</TE>

<HD>Yorba Linda Spared by Fire</HD>
<DH>Danger: Flames approach homes, but wind sends blaze into
Chino Hills State Park. Two boys arrested.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After flames came to within 20 yards of backyard fences Sunday night,
winds pushed back a fire in east Yorba Linda, sending it into the
wilds of Chino Hills State Park.</LD>
<LD>   By nightfall, the fire had charred 125 acres. Flames had died
down, said Capt. Stephen Miller, a spokesman for the Orange County
Fire Authority. He said that although the blaze was only 20%
contained, firefighters were confident no more structures were
threatened.</LD>
<LD>   Late Sunday, fire officials and Brea police arrested two
15-year-old boys for allegedly starting the fire by playing with
illegal fireworks, said Miller.</LD>
<TE>   The youths were part of a group of boys seen playing in the area.
The two boys arrested were released to their parents, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The fire started about 5 p.m. near a steep ridge along Evening
Breeze Drive, which is next to open land on Orange County's eastern
border, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents said the fire moved quickly up the ridge.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's too close to our house right now. I can't talk. I've got to
grab a hose,'' yelled one resident on the telephone.</TE>
<TE>   Anxious neighbors spent the late afternoon wetting lawns and
bushes around their homes while eyeing the hillside, where flames
shot 20 feet into the air.</TE>
<TE>   ''People were turning on their lawn sprinklers and watering
everything,'' said resident Tim Scaboo, 20. ''Although there were
lots of firefighters, it had some people really nervous.''</TE>
<TE>   Though flames came near backyards, residents were not evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   Strong winds pushed flames east into the state park in San
Bernardino County. Miller said there were no structures within the
park.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters hoped lower temperatures, overnight moisture and calm
winds would help crews knock down the brush fire by today.</TE>
<TE>   ''Originally there was a potential, and homes were threatened, but
the winds were in our favor,'' Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 120 firefighters from several agencies fought the fire.
An airplane and two helicopters dropped fire retardant and water in
the early stages of the fire.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time in nearly a century, scientists have discovered a
new order of insects. Just three of the paperclip-sized insects are
known, Danish and German researchers reported in the April 19 edition
of Science. The insects have been placed in the new category
mantophasmatodea.</LD>
<LD>   They are a little less than an inch long, and two of the examples
under study in laboratories came from tropical Africa. The two had
been in museums. An additional example was found encased in amber
from Europe's Baltic region.</LD>
<LD>   The age of the African examples, now held for study in museums, is
not known.</LD>
<TE>   The new insects look a bit like crickets, but lack the jumping
hind legs that mark that order. The scientists said that, based on
their stomach contents, the insects appear to be carnivores.</TE>

<LD>Q: Will eating spicy food make my body burn more calories?</LD>
<LD>   A: No. Some people think it does because spicy foods make them
sweat and feel hot, but the effect is so small as to be irrelevant. A
small study has shown a weight-loss benefit from eating cayenne
pepper, but it required consuming at least 10 grams--about five
teaspoons--per day, more than most people can comfortably ingest</LD>

<LD>Researchers have for the first time been able to induce long-term
suppression of the hepatitis C virus in patients carrying the viral
strain that is most common in North America. The work was reported by
physicians at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in New York
City.</LD>
<LD>   The key to the treatment was matching the dose of drugs to the
particular genetic composition of a patient's virus, the team told a
medical conference in Madrid.</LD>
<LD>   Using a combination of the antiviral drug ribavirin and a
long-acting form of interferon alfa-2a, the team reported attaining
an overall suppression of 61%, the highest ever achieved.</LD>
<TE>   In patients with the most common North American strain, 51% had
suppression of the virus for at least six months, the team reported.</TE>

<LD>The cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor, a member of the new family of
drugs called statins, can reverse many of the symptoms of multiple
sclerosis in mice, Stanford researchers reported at the Experimental
Biology 2002 meeting in New Orleans.</LD>
<LD>   The drug apparently reduces the production of immune proteins that
stimulate inflammation and increases production of those that
suppress it.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Sawsan Youssef and Dr. Lawrence Steinman found that Lipitor
could prevent both the relapsing and acute forms of an MS-like
disease in mice when administered before the disease was triggered.
The drug also could reverse symptoms in mice with the chronic
relapsing form of the disease.</LD>

<HD>The Virus as a Tool of Medicine</HD>
<DH>U.S. scientists are showing increasing interest in
harnessing 'bacteria eaters' to attack and destroy disease-causing
microbes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They are many times smaller than a bacterium--yet can easily reduce
one to rubble. With steely purpose, they stick to the wall of a
bacterial cell and inject their genetic material. Then they use the
cell to copy themselves over and over again before crashing out and
drifting off to cause more mayhem elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   Just as there are viruses that infect and cause disease in humans,
so there are viruses that infect bacteria.</LD>
<LD>   For decades, researchers in the former Soviet bloc used and
studied those viruses--known as bacteriophage, or "bacteria
eaters"--in hopes of curing disease. Now, after years of ignoring
them, U.S. scientists are showing increasing interest.</LD>
<TE>   The need for new approaches in fighting disease is obvious, says
Marissa Miller, who directs the antimicrobial resistance program at
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Overuse of
antibiotics has caused drugs to lose a lot of their clout as more and
more bugs become resistant.</TE>
<TE>   This is especially a problem in hospitals, where already-sick
people can develop complications such as pneumonia and blood
infections from bacteria that are resistant to nearly all available
drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "In these cases, the therapeutic options are very limited--and
usually include drugs that are very toxic," Miller says.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the problem, scientists and companies are exploring
avenues such as small, antibacterial proteins, therapies to boost
people's immune systems--and bacteriophage.</TE>
<TE>   Some are studying specific molecules that the bacteriophage make,
in the hope that they might be developed into drugs. Others envision
a time when cocktails of bacteriophage that attack various dangerous
bacteria might be swallowed or injected or applied to wounds to kill
offending microbes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an important research area," says scientist Carl Merril, a
bacteriophage expert at the National Institutes of Health. "People
are going to have to put some work into it, but it'll be a real shame
not to develop these agents, because I really think they can save
lives."</TE>
<TE>   Most Abundant Life Form on Earth</TE>
<TE>   Bacteriophage--or "phage" for short--are everywhere in nature and
are probably big players in the ecology of the microworld. One
milliliter of unpolluted water can contain 200 million phage, and
there are about 1031--1 with 31 zeroes after it--of them on this
planet, making them the Earth's most abundant life form.</TE>
<TE>   They vary enormously. Phage come in a medley of shapes, from
simple spheres to rods equipped with elaborate landing gear that give
them the look of alien insects. Their genes can be of RNA or DNA.
They have different ways of getting into cells and different
consequences: some always destroy their hosts while some hang around
in cells for long periods without causing harm.</TE>
<TE>   And while some phage have been studied in exquisite detail, some
are entirely unknown.</TE>
<TE>   The first phage were independently discovered around 1915 by two
scientists, a British bacteriologist, Frederick Twort, and
French-Canadian microbiologist Felix d'Herelle, who was working at
the Pasteur Institute in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   D'Herelle--who actively pursued the discovery--had cultured stool
samples from soldiers suffering from dysentery and had noticed
something odd about the bacteria growing in his petri dishes. The
lawn of happily growing Shigella microbes had bullet-like holes in
them.</TE>
<TE>   The holes were places where phage had infected cells and killed
them.</TE>
<TE>   D'Herelle suspected he was dealing with a virus and began a long
series of experiments and treatments. His first patient was a
12-year-old child who was gravely ill with dysentery. D'Herelle and
colleagues made a phage preparation, swallowed some of it themselves
to make sure it wasn't harmful, then treated the child and several
others. All of the patients survived.</TE>
<TE>   In subsequent years, D'Herelle experimented with phage to treat
diseases in chickens as well as human diseases such as cholera and
bubonic plague. He also manufactured commercial products containing
different types of phage to treat abscesses, infected wounds,
respiratory infections and more.</TE>
<TE>   Products in Wide Use Before World War II</TE>
<TE>   For a while, phage nostrums were everywhere. They were
manufactured in the United States before World War II. They were even
used during the war by the Germans: vials of phage were found in the
medical kits of Rommel's forces in North Africa.</TE>
<TE>   And in the Soviet Union, phage therapy flowered under Joseph
Stalin, who helped D'Herelle and scientist Giorgi Eliava set up a
huge research institute in Georgia, where tons of phage were
manufactured daily. (Eliava was later pronounced a "people's enemy"
and executed.)</TE>
<TE>   In the West, however, phage therapy was dropped entirely--in large
part because of the discovery of penicillin and other antibiotics.</TE>
<TE>   "The feeling was--why bother with phage therapy or anything else,
once we had those miracle drugs?" says Alexander Sulakvelidze, a
scientist at the University of Maryland and co-founder of Intralytix,
one of several U.S. companies now developing phage therapy.</TE>
<TE>   Phage were still studied, however--for quite a different purpose.
Simple and easy to grow in huge numbers, they were used in
practically every landmark experiment in the early history of
molecular biology: to show that the blueprint of life was carried in
DNA; to crack the genetic code, to cite just two examples.</TE>
<TE>   And it was studies with phage that led to the discovery--quite by
chance--of enzymes that allowed DNA to be cut into pieces at will,
ushering in the genetic engineering revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Today, increased contact with scientists in former Soviet bloc
countries has helped revive an interest in the phage as a medical
tool.</TE>
<TE>   Before, "we didn't talk with them, didn't know their science,"
says William Summers, molecular biologist and phage historian at Yale
University School of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we're getting to know them and talk with them. They've shown
us what they do, and it sounds reasonable."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, scientists cite problems with many of the phage
studies from these countries, some of which involved thousands of
people.</TE>
<TE>   The studies rarely contained controls or the double-blind design
considered state-of-the-art for clinical trials today--making it hard
to know if the phage actually improved patients' recovery. The brews
of phage used were often too diluted, or dead, or inappropriate for
the infection being treated.</TE>
<TE>   Recent Studies Show Potential</TE>
<TE>   Recently, scientists have published more rigorous experiments
using animal models.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, a series of British studies from the 1980s onward
showed that mice, calves and chickens could be protected from
disease-causing strains of E. coli, the common stomach bacteria, by
treatment with phage that specifically attack the bad E. coli and
leave the normal E. coli alone.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, phage were found to be more effective than
antibiotics.</TE>
<TE>   More recent studies have shown that phage can fight particularly
troublesome microbes.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Merril at NIH, in collaboration with a company called
Exponential Biotherapies, showed that a bacteriophage can protect
mice from a particularly dangerous bacterium.</TE>
<TE>   The microbe, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecum, is
increasingly being found in hospitals and nursing homes and can cause
life-threatening infections of the blood and heart valves.</TE>
<TE>   The company has completed early clinical trials--testing safely in
small numbers of people--with the phage.</TE>
<TE>   Companies are pursuing other bugs, too.</TE>
<TE>   Exponential Biotherapies, Intralytix and another company called
Phage Therapeutics are variously investigating phage to fight
antibiotic-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus,
multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, pathogens infecting burns and
ulcers, as well as various food-borne illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   In the latter case, food products or animals such as chickens
could be treated with phage to kill disease-causing bugs.</TE>
<TE>   Other scientists are working not on the entire phage, but on parts
of it.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent Fischetti, head of Rockefeller University's bacterial
pathogenesis lab, has shown that phage enzymes called lysins, which
poke holes in a bacterium's wall, can protect mice from infections.</TE>
<TE>   Each lysin--just like each phage--is extremely picky about the
kind of bug it will attack.</TE>
<TE>   "You're only killing the organism you want to kill," Fischetti
says.</TE>
<TE>   And Ry Young, a bacteriophage researcher at Texas A&amp;M University
in College Station, has found that some phage contain short proteins
that are toxic to bacteria and which could conceivably be developed
into a new class of drugs to fight infection.</TE>
<TE>   Phage have their disadvantages. Among other problems, doctors have
to know precisely what infection they're fighting in order to know
which phage to commit to the battle. And some types of phage carry
genes that can actually make bacteria pathogenic. On the other hand,
phage do not attack our normal microbial flora--only the disease we
want to fight.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, Young points out, "They're the only medicine that
multiplies."</TE>

<HD>Simon Camp Fears Loss of Momentum</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just weeks after pulling off one of the most stunning political
upsets in California history, gubernatorial hopeful Bill Simon Jr. is
facing growing doubts within his own Republican Party about his ability
to oust incumbent Democrat Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   Plagued by poor fund-raising, friction among campaign advisors and
continued tensions with the Bush White House, Simon is being widely, if
quietly, criticized for failing to better capitalize on his momentum
after romping past Richard Riordan in the March 5 primary.</LD>
<LD>   The general election is not until November, leaving plenty of time for
circumstances to change. And Simon has been underestimated before; even
some aides questioned his ability to come from behind and beat Riordan in
the Republican race.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the doubts about Simon run the risk of compounding his
problems, creating a cycle in which a lack of confidence in GOP circles
hurts Simon's fund-raising and political viability--and that, in turn,
further diminishes Simon's fund-raising and political viability.</TE>
<TE>   Publicly, the candidate professes not to worry. "You know, they said
the same thing in the primary," Simon remarked of his doubters, noting
their exhortations to spend more money and start television advertising
earlier than he did.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, however, even Simon advisors concede that the candidate
still has a selling job to do, particularly among centrists within his
own party and independents. Of greater immediate concern is the
resistance from major Republican Party donors, whose support is vital to
raising the $30 million to $40 million he will need to wage a serious
campaign against the richly funded Davis.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the Simon campaign has been wrestling behind the
scenes with disagreements over staffing and budget matters, as the White
House and other outsiders press the candidate to expand his campaign's
ranks and broaden his strategy team to include additional, more seasoned
professionals, according to Republicans in touch with both camps. So far,
Simon has done little to broaden his appeal--or outreach--beyond the
GOP's conservative core.</TE>
<TE>   "My honest view is that Davis is vulnerable and Simon can win," said
Republican pollster Arnold Steinberg, who is not affiliated with the
Simon campaign. "But I'm meeting with some skepticism when I say that."</TE>
<TE>   Others, speaking anonymously, were blunter still. "There's a sense
among Republicans that this is winnable, but there's a 'but' attached,"
said one Republican, who is prominent in Sacramento and wished to remain
unidentified for the sake of party unity. "It's winnable, but it will
still take a very good campaign and I don't think there's any assurance
yet that's going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Frustrations were compounded this week after Davis threw Simon on the
defensive for failing to release his income tax returns, something the
governor does along with most candidates for high office. The controversy
turned the focus away from recent developments that could have hurt the
governor had they gotten more attention.</TE>
<TE>   "Davis says he might cut education funding, his administration spends
millions of dollars on a computer system the state doesn't need and Bill
Simon is talking about Karl Marx," one GOP strategist complained,
referring to Simon's comments comparing Davis to the father of socialism
after being pressed about his tax history.</TE>
<TE>Counting on a 'Spring in GOP Step' From Bush</TE>
<TE>   Strategists for Simon acknowledge getting off to a slow start. In
fact, even campaign insiders acknowledge they had no strategy beyond 8
p.m. on March 5, when the polls closed in the Republican primary. (For
his part, Riordan had filmed TV commercials and planned to start airing
them the next day.)</TE>
<TE>   The Simon team is now counting heavily on a boost from President Bush,
who plans to headline a pair of fund-raisers at the end of the month, in
Beverly Hills and Foster City, a suburb south of San Francisco. The twin
appearances are expected to raise several million dollars and, perhaps as
important, invigorate party activists who have seen few traces of Simon
since his primary win.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of this despondency is premature," said Kevin Spillane,
who served as political director of the Riordan campaign. "If Bush comes
out and raises $3 million to $4 million"--as the Simon campaign
predicts--"I think you'll see a new spring in Republicans' step."</TE>
<TE>   Both campaigns are faced with an unusual dynamic in this election
season, a result of the state's unprecedented March 5 vote. In years
past, California held its gubernatorial primaries in June, leaving just a
few summer months before the traditional fall kickoff on Labor Day. This
year, the candidates faced an eight-month lag between the primary and the
general election, a period too long for a sustained TV campaign. For that
reason, neither Davis nor Simon has aired any post-primary
advertising--despite expectations that Davis might seize the airwaves the
way he did against Riordan to preemptively pound his opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "The early primary and consequently the length of the general election
campaign makes it difficult," said David Doak, the campaign strategist
who produces Davis' TV spots. "Once we go up, we want to stay up, except
for a few strategic breathers."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, in turn, has just a small fraction of the $30 million that
Davis has in his campaign account. His fund-raising has been weak--he
collected just $160,000 in a swing through Washington last week--and, so
far, the wealthy investor has shown little inclination to sink much of
his own money into the fall contest. Thus, it may be months before Simon
resurfaces on TV.</TE>
<TE>   For many Californians, watching advertisements on television is pretty
much the extent of their engagement in politics. For them, the
gubernatorial campaign has essentially disappeared. That is not to say,
however, that this quiet time is unimportant or irrelevant to the outcome
in November.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people aren't paying attention right now," said Dan Schnur, a
longtime Republican communications strategist. "But those people who are
watching wield a disproportionate amount of influence. This is the time
where the parameters of the campaign debate are established. This is the
time in a campaign when people decide that George Bush isn't smart, or
that Al Gore doesn't tell the truth. By the time the voters start paying
attention to the campaign, those early impressions are established as
fact."</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of that, Davis has staged a series of high-profile
appearances, attacking Simon almost daily for his opposition to legalized
abortion and boasting about his record on issues ranging from health care
to highway construction. Along the way, Davis has suffered a few bumps of
his own. Over the last week, he has been assailed by the California
Teachers Assn., a powerful political ally, over education funding and for
refusing to make textbook selection a part of teachers' contract
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Davis blew up during a meeting with the editorial board of
the San Diego Union Tribune, extolling himself for keeping the lights
burning during last year's electricity crisis and complaining "I don't
get squat" in return.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows that you scratch him a little bit and it doesn't take much
to set him off," said Ken Khachigian, a longtime Republican strategist.
"Therein lies a lesson for Bill Simon."</TE>
<TE>Simon Has Targeted Conservative Audiences</TE>
<TE>   Ever since winning the primary, Simon has maintained a strikingly low
profile, avoiding reporters and speaking mostly to small, sympathetic
groups. During his three-day Washington swing, for instance, he made only
a single public appearance, a brief news conference in the driveway
outside the White House after privately posing for a picture and
discussing his campaign with Bush. A good part of his time in the capital
was spent meeting with conservative pundits and policy analysts who
already support his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Simon has done much of his post-primary campaigning on
conservative talk radio, reiterating positions such as support for a cut
in the capital gains tax and the construction of private toll roads,
which may reinforce his backing among Davis-haters but seem unlikely to
expand his support to a wider, more centrist audience. "That's primary
rhetoric," said the GOP strategist in Sacramento. "There's no sign of
them trying to broaden Simon's appeal."</TE>
<TE>   But to Sal Russo, chief strategist for the Simon campaign, all the
second-guessing and hand-wringing have a familiar--and hollow--ring.
After all, many of the complaints about failing to reach out, to more
aggressively attack his opponent on television and to abandon a strict
adherence to conservative orthodoxy were voiced in Simon's race against
the front-running Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just like the primary," Russo said. "Everybody said back in
September, 'Gee, you ought to be on TV.' In October, November, December,
'TV, TV, TV.' . . . But we waited until we thought we would get voters'
attention. And, my God, we won by 20 points."</TE>

<HD>Far-Rightist Le Pen Is Mighty in France</HD>
<DH>Election: National Front leader surges to presidential runoff,
upsetting Socialist Premier Jospin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>Far-right candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen rocked the political
landscape in the first round of France's presidential election Sunday,
upsetting Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and setting up a runoff with
President Jacques Chirac.</LD>
<LD>   Le Pen, a former paratrooper who has been accused of neo-fascism and
racism throughout a rowdy political career, is the first far-right
candidate in French history to advance to the final round in a
presidential election. His triumph was a calamity for the Socialist
Jospin, who announced that he will resign after the May 5 runoff and
retire from political life.</LD>
<LD>   With 99.5% of the ballots counted, the center-right Chirac had
5,510,180 votes, or 19.65%. Le Pen had 4,783,440 votes, or 17.08%, and
Jospin had 4,501,843, or 16.05%. The remaining ballots were split among
the rest of the 16 candidates.</LD>
<TE>   The stunning result reflected worries among voters about an alarming
rise in crime--which Le Pen blames largely on immigration from North
African countries--and the perceived failure of Jospin to impose law and
order during his five years in office, according to many analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than a groundswell of extremist sentiment, the surprise
breakthrough by Le Pen's National Front party also seemed a product of
protest votes against a stagnant establishment, divisions on the
political left and a near-record 28% level of voter absenteeism.</TE>
<TE>   The 73-year-old Le Pen, a patriarch of the European hard right who is
infamous for crude remarks about minorities, clearly relished his arrival
at center stage Sunday night. He said the voters had punished Jospin and
Chirac, president since 1995, for the ineptitude and remoteness of the
political elite.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a great defeat for the two leaders of the
establishment," Le Pen said in a television interview. Earlier, he
addressed his followers with the nationalistic, populist flair that makes
him one of France's most fiery speakers. He made a pointed appeal for the
support of voters of all ideologies and races, part of a continuing
effort to moderate his image.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't be afraid to dream, you the little people, the excluded, don't
be infected by the old divisions of left and right," he declared. "You
the miners, the metalworkers, the workers of all the industries ruined by
Euro-globalization. . . . Those who are the first victims of crime in the
cities and villages . . . know that I will be there at the side of all
who suffer."</TE>
<TE>   The political math makes Le Pen's chances of ultimate victory minimal.
More than 40% of the votes Sunday went to nine left-of-center candidates,
including Jospin. Several of those contenders vowed to mobilize against
Le Pen's party in the presidential vote, even if that meant supporting
Chirac, and in crucial legislative elections in June that will decide the
true balance of power here.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Le Pen has blindsided and sidelined the French left in
the presidential race. After years in which voters resisted the advance
of center-right forces that have gained power in neighboring Spain and
Italy, the Socialists confront a potentially devastating scenario: a
Chirac win in the runoff and a subsequent onslaught by the center-right
and extreme right in the parliamentary elections.</TE>
<TE>Jospin Declares His Loss a 'Thunderbolt'</TE>
<TE>   Jospin's abrupt decision to withdraw from politics acknowledged the
size of the blow. He called it a "thunderbolt." The stern veteran
Socialist took full responsibility for the debacle, though he also blamed
the "demagoguery of the right and the divisions of the left."</TE>
<TE>   "Seeing the extreme right represent more than 20% of the votes in our
nation and their principal candidate confront the right-wing candidate in
the second round is a very worrisome sign for France and our democracy,"
said Jospin, 64.</TE>
<TE>   Jospin has a reputation for integrity, but he comes across as rigid,
especially on the campaign trail. As the smoke of his political
crash-and-burn cleared, analysts said he was the victim of his
"cohabitation" with Chirac and his inability to unite a spectrum of
leftists who range from his mainstream Socialists and Trotskyites to
old-school Communists and Greens.</TE>
<TE>   "He opened a space among the young and the popular sectors to the
radical left," political commentator Philippe Chriqui said Sunday night.
As Jospin's campaign veered from social democratic moderation to an
assertion that he represented "the real left," the analyst said, the
candidate was unable to "stop the hemorrhage to other leftist
candidates."</TE>
<TE>   But Jospin's fall and Le Pen's rise grew out of a more fundamental
disillusionment with government and politics, analysts said. The record
number of candidates--many of them protest candidates and marginal
extremists of left and right--and low turnout were symptoms of a malaise.</TE>
<TE>   And Le Pen clearly read the voters' mood by hammering away at the
problem of security: The issue mixes delicate questions about crime,
ethnicity and national identity that Jospin seemed unwilling to tackle or
even discuss.</TE>
<TE>   Both Chirac and Le Pen blamed Jospin for the fact that crime has risen
steadily in recent years. It went up by about 8% in 2001. A sense of
lawlessness has been worsened by cop-killings, brazen holdups with
automatic weapons and last month's massacre of eight city council members
in a Paris suburb by a mentally disturbed gunman. Police complain that
they are handcuffed by weak laws, timid politicians and insufficient
resources.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the crackdown on Islamic terrorist networks in France after
the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States rekindled concern about the
potential convergence of crime and Islamic extremism in the country's
increasingly large and menacing North African immigrant ghettos.</TE>
<TE>   Gloomy housing projects are a fixture in urban France, even in small
cities, and youths are trapped in a subculture of drugs and violence.
Prisons have become a hotbed of recruiting by Islamic extremists; the
Middle East crisis has triggered a wave of violent anti-Semitic acts
blamed mainly on thugs of North African descent.</TE>
<TE>   Fear of crime for many French is synonymous with fear of "ghetto
youth," a symbol of the society's failure to integrate immigrants from
North Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Le Pen. He has railed for three decades that immigration causes
crime and unemployment. He wants to expel all illegal immigrants, give
French nationals priority for jobs and benefits, and crack down on
lawbreaking in the slums. He also has called for France to pull out of
the European Union and other international organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Although his rhetoric has been guarded during this campaign, his
platform should be seen in historical context. In the past, he provoked
outrage with crude comments about Jews, foreigners and AIDS. In 1989, he
made up a pun combining the name of a Jewish Cabinet minister here with a
word for the ovens in Nazi death camps. He also suggested that AIDS
patients should be confined to "AIDS-atoriums."</TE>
<TE>Brawler, Rugby Player and Paratrooper</TE>
<TE>   Son of a Breton fisherman, Le Pen studied law while earning a
reputation as a brawler, rugby player and enthusiast of far-right causes.
He lost an eye in a fight and sported a black patch for years, then
switched to a less piratical glass eye. He also served as a paratrooper
in the former colonies of Indochina and Algeria.</TE>
<TE>   Le Pen founded the National Front in 1972. The party gradually
gathered momentum, sending deputies to the French and European
parliaments and winning control of cities such as Toulon and Orange in
southeastern France, a stronghold of anti-immigrant sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   Le Pen has won nearly 15% of the vote in his previous presidential
bids, making him a kingmaker of sorts. But his party has slumped in
recent years because of internal divisions. He barely scraped together
the signatures needed for his candidacy this year.</TE>
<TE>   Now he is back in the spotlight with a vengeance. Marchers took to the
streets to denounce him in Paris and other cities in spontaneous rallies
Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   Chirac, a clear favorite for reelection, set a somber tone for the
campaign of the next two weeks. Without mentioning Le Pen by name, he
said the French will have a fateful decision to make in the runoff.</TE>
<TE>   "The moment of choice is before you," Chirac said. "It is about the
future of France. . . . I appeal to France, that diverse, humane, warm
France that we love. . . . I hope that in the coming days, each of us
proves our responsibility, tolerance and respect."</TE>

<HD>Destruction Cripples Palestinian Ministries</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>As Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon declared an end to Israel's
three-week invasion of the West Bank to root out terrorists, top
Palestinian ministers returning to their offices for the first time in
weeks Sunday were greeted by scenes of devastation in government
buildings in this de facto capital.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli soldiers apparently destroyed numerous Palestinian Authority
offices during their weekend pullout from the West Bank, hobbling crucial
civic functions such as education and public works.</LD>
<LD>   In ministry after ministry, computers, photocopiers and other
electronic machines were heaped in piles, destroyed by explosions and
fire. Important files were missing. Telephones were smashed. Pictures
were ripped from the walls.</LD>
<TE>   Palestinian officials were just beginning to assess the damage from
the Israeli offensive. But partial estimates placed losses as high as
$450 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The main reason for all the destruction is to kill the spirit of the
Palestinian people and show the power and force of the Israelis," Azam
Ahmad, the minister of public works, said as he walked through his
shattered office. "They want to take us back many years in history so we
will lose hope, but we are a people who have learned to endure."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli army officials acknowledged searching the ministries but
denied any attempt to deliberately cripple public services. They also
denied using explosives to destroy computers or documents.</TE>
<TE>   They said they were forced to enter the buildings after discovering
links between Palestinian terrorists and Palestinian Authority government
offices. They acknowledged taking documents from some of the offices for
intelligence purposes but denied claims of unnecessary destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "We searched them because we had to search them. In these searches,
there's a certain amount of disruption," said one military official. "We
do not know of wanton damage."</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations is planning a meeting in Oslo this week to seek
pledges for funds to help the Palestinians rebuild. Since the Palestinian
Authority was created after the 1993 Oslo accords, donor nations have
contributed more than $3 billion to build up the Palestinian government
and nonprofit organizations.</TE>
<TE>   But still more money will be needed in the wake of the widespread
destruction left behind by the Israeli invasion, which began March 29.
Tanks tore up streets. Schools, hospitals, homes and stores were hit by
rockets, shells and bullets. Electricity poles collapsed. Water mains
were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>Limited Access Delays Full Tally of Damage</TE>
<TE>   One Palestinian official said every single ministry building was
vandalized except the ministries of planning and youth and sports. The
U.N. said it would take at least a week to reach a final tally, since
Israeli soldiers continued blocking entry into some areas.</TE>
<TE>   "Access is still difficult," said one U.N. official.</TE>
<TE>   The extent of damage to the offices emerged as Sharon announced that
the offensive in the West Bank had officially ended after severely
disrupting the terrorist network responsible for a wave of suicide
bombings in Israel. He promised more action in the future but was not
specific.</TE>
<TE>   "We have completed this stage of the operation," Sharon said while
visiting a Jerusalem supermarket. "The struggle against terrorism
continues and will continue, but this time it will work in a different
method."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli soldiers have withdrawn in the last few days from several West
Bank cities, including Jenin, Nablus and much of Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, troops remained around Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat's compound in Ramallah and the Church of the Nativity in
Bethlehem, where scores of Palestinians sought refuge after the invasion
began.</TE>
<TE>   Late Thursday, five Palestinians with white flags emerged from the
church and were quickly taken away for questioning by Israeli security
officials. It was unclear who the five Palestinians were, but sources
inside the church said the men were fleeing because they had injuries or
were tired of the standoff.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who returned to Washington on
Thursday from a 10-day trip to the region, said Sunday on CBS' "Face the
Nation" that he was pleased with the partial Israeli withdrawal over the
weekend but "not completely satisfied" with the ongoing presence of tanks
and troops in Palestinian areas.</TE>
<TE>   He promised relief for the Jenin refugee camp, site of the fiercest
fighting, and asked the Israelis to give Arafat more access to the
outside world.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to see the withdrawal continue until there's no question
about it. . . . I would ultimately like to see those units back in their
garrisons and not poised in the way they are. And I would like to see the
cities opened up, so that we can start to see normal life resume, and so
that there are no restrictions with respect to the provision of
humanitarian aid," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ministry of Higher Education officials said neighbors had told them
that Israeli soldiers entered their office shortly after 8 p.m. Friday.
The neighbors reported seeing soldiers blast their way into the building,
then hearing 13 explosions during the course of the night.</TE>
<TE>Staff Member Tours His Ruined Office</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, the offices were a shambles. On all six floors, the pattern
seemed the same. Computer monitors, printers and photo-copiers--all
purchased with international aid money--were pulled off desks and piled
in a central room. Many computers were missing their hard drives.</TE>
<TE>   The electronic equipment had either been smashed with a heavy object
or charred by flames. On the top floor of the ministry, a crater could be
seen in the floor, and windows on all sides were blown out. On some
floors, files were scattered, while other files were simply missing.</TE>
<TE>   Gabriel Baramki, an educational consultant in the Ministry of Higher
Education and former university president, seemed near tears as he toured
the remains of his office.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't help but cry when you see it," said Baramki, as he stepped
across broken glass and smashed computers. "They have taken us at least
10 or 15 years backward."</TE>
<TE>   The Ministry of Higher Education provides administrative support to
Palestinian universities, which the Israeli government sees as hotbeds of
Palestinian activism. But the military source said the Israeli government
wanted to keep Palestinian civilian institutions intact.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal of this operation was not to destroy the Palestinian
Authority's civilian infrastructure. That has to be made clear," the
official said.</TE>
<TE>   Damage to the Ministry of Public Works was even more puzzling. One
room on the top floor seemed to have been blasted by a helicopter rocket.
The outside window was blackened, while a conference room inside was
completely charred.</TE>
<TE>   Down the hall on the fourth floor, the minister's offices were simply
vandalized. Couches and chairs were slashed, the stuffing spilling out. A
map of the region had the West Bank torn out. Even the minister's
personal toilet was shattered.</TE>
<TE>'We Don't Want to Turn . . . Into a Museum'</TE>
<TE>   Ahmad, the minister, seemed dazed as he wandered through his offices.</TE>
<TE>   "Why? Why?" he asked repeatedly. But he vowed to get the ministry,
responsible for roads and sewers, working again within a week.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to turn ourselves into a museum. Life continues. We
cannot stop," Ahmad said.</TE>
<TE>   A short distance away, the Ministry of Education and the Palestinian
Legislative Council also suffered damage. Israelis have accused
Palestinians of producing schoolbooks filled with anti-Israel propaganda.</TE>
<TE>   Naim abu Hommos, the acting education minister, said 150 soldiers in
tanks and armored personnel carriers broke into the ministry building
April 3 and a second time April 14.</TE>
<TE>   He said that employees had offered to open doors with their keys but
that soldiers sometimes ignored them and forced their way in. In the
ministry's treasury department, ceiling tiles were scattered on the
floor. Some files were pulled off the shelves. And, Abu Hommos said, more
than $8,000 in petty cash was missing.</TE>
<TE>   At least 47 schools are said to have been damaged across the
Palestinian educational system, which has 1 million students and 45,000
teachers. Abu Hommos said he was still trying to tally how many students
were killed or injured in the invasion.</TE>
<TE>   He smiled sadly when asked what effect the destruction had.</TE>
<TE>   "The Israelis lost," he said. "They are teaching another generation
not to believe in them."</TE>

<HD>Key U.S. Clerics Plan to Push for Law's Removal</HD>
<DH>Religion: Several cardinals will press Vatican insiders about the
beleaguered Boston archbishop, ahead of scheduled talks with the pope on
sex abuse cases.</DH>

</DL>
<LD>Several senior American cardinals will urge the Vatican today to
ask Cardinal Bernard Law to resign as archbishop of Boston in the face of
an escalating sexual abuse scandal in the Roman Catholic Church.</LD>
<LD>   Two American clerics--a bishop and a cardinal--said that America's
Catholic bishops are all but unanimous in believing that Law must leave
Boston for the good of the church.</LD>
<LD>   The cardinal, who asked to remain anonymous, said Sunday that he had
been "commissioned" by other senior prelates to take their case against
Law directly to Pope John Paul II's inner circle. He said that he, as
well as others, would do so today during private meetings at the Vatican.
Today's meetings come a day before two days of talks between America's
cardinals and Vatican leaders on the abuse scandal.</LD>
<TE>   "If the Holy See wants to send a strong signal of quality and
standards of leadership," the cardinal told The Times, Law "will have to
be replaced. This cannot be a phaseout." The cardinal said he did not
want to undermine his efforts by publicly disclosing his name before
speaking to the Vatican.</TE>
<TE>   The bishop, also speaking on a confidential basis, told The Times,
"Many bishops are of the mind that the healing process really can't begin
until there's a change of leadership in Boston."</TE>
<TE>   The rare move against a fellow cardinal underscored Law's increasingly
precarious position in the wake of his handling of the scandal in his
archdiocese, and the growing determination by the U.S. hierarchy to call
for dramatic steps to extricate the American church from one of its worst
crises in modern times.</TE>
<TE>   A week ago Law flew to Rome to confer privately with the pope and
other Vatican officials about his future. He returned to Boston and
announced that he would continue as archbishop as long, he said, as God
would permit him to serve. On Sunday, Law received a standing ovation
when he told churchgoers at Holy Cross Cathedral that he wished that he
could "undo the harm" caused by his handling of cases involving the
sexual abuse of minors by priests.</TE>
<TE>   Since the scandal erupted in January in Boston, it has spread across
the country as sexual abuse allegations, many of them based on
molestations going back decades, surfaced in other dioceses, including
Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland and West Palm Beach, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   "He [Law] created the impression that nobody did anything, and that's
what infuriated a lot of us," the cardinal said.</TE>
<TE>   Father Ciro Benedettini, a Vatican spokesman, would not acknowledge or
comment on continuing pressure for Law's resignation. It is "pure
speculation" that Law's job could become a topic of discussion at the
meetings this week, he said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Other American church officials, noting that Law had met a week ago
with the pope, said his tenure as archbishop was an issue between the two
men only.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the question must remain in the hands of Cardinal Law,
taking into account his own perception of the feelings of his priests and
his parishioners and his dialogue with the Holy Father," Cardinal J.
Francis Stafford, an American in the Vatican hierarchy, told the Roman
newspaper La Repubblica. "I cannot judge."</TE>
<TE>   But Bishop William S. Skylstad, archbishop of Spokane, Wash., and vice
president of the U.S. bishops conference, told ABC News Sunday before
leaving for Rome that Law "is in a very difficult situation."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Los Angeles' Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, asked to
comment on Law's future, said he would find it difficult to walk down an
aisle in church if he had been guilty of gross negligence.</TE>
<TE>Call to Close Loopholes</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal who spoke to The Times on the condition of anonymity said
he hoped that Law would step down "soon." In any case, he said, Law
should not delay his resignation beyond the June meeting in Dallas of the
United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, who are poised to impose a
new and mandatory protocol on all U.S. bishops for handling and
preventing sexual abuse in their 195 dioceses.</TE>
<TE>   The details of the protocol are to be worked out during the two-day,
closed door consultation beginning Tuesday between the eight U.S.
cardinal-archbishops and the pope and the highest-ranking cardinals in
the Vatican. The Americans hope to win Rome's approval for imposing
binding standards on all U.S. bishops.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said he will call for worldwide standards. He said many U.S.
archdioceses rely on foreign priests, some of whom are "problem priests."
Yet, he said, often their home bishops or religious order superiors fail
to inform their American counterpart of a priest's failings. A worldwide
protocol would help close such loopholes.</TE>
<TE>   Sex scandals in America, in which dozens of priests have been accused
of abusing children, have shaken the faith of American Catholics, cost
the church millions of dollars in settlements and raised questions about
American bishops' handling of investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Bishops in Florida, Ireland and Poland have resigned because of the
scandals. But most of the criticism has focused on Law, who allowed
pedophile priests to continue their ministries. Two cases in which Boston
area priests were transferred from parish to parish and continued to
molest minors outraged Catholic leaders in his archdiocese, who called
for his resignation and vowed to tighten their purse strings.</TE>
<TE>   Now the lobbying against Law has reached the Vatican.</TE>
<TE>Talks May Backfire</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Francis George of Chicago said he did not know about the
effort to press the Vatican for Law's removal. He said he was surprised
to hear of it and had no immediate position on it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a part of it," he said. "I'm not going to judge what other
bishops are doing. Every bishop does what he feels he has to do for the
good of the church. I'm not going to respond to it. I haven't had time to
think about it."</TE>
<TE>   George S. Weigel, an American theologian and papal biographer who has
spent the last three weeks in Rome, predicted that any church official
who advocates Law's resignation this week will "marginalize himself in
the discussion."</TE>
<TE>   "People may talk about how far this situation has gone and what other
situations have to be looked at," Weigel said. "But this is not a meeting
to discuss Boston. The temper here is not for that kind of discussion.
That's not the way the church works."</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican does not respond to "the press fervor of the moment," he
said, adding that the cardinals were more likely to discuss the criteria
under which any bishop who has mishandled a sex abuse case should step
down.</TE>
<TE>   But Father Thomas Williams, dean of theology at the pontifical
university Regina Apostolorum in Rome, said the debate over Law's
position "is good in the sense that everyone should be heard."</TE>
<TE>   "There's a variety of opinions about what should be done [about Law]
among those who are sincerely looking after the best interests of the
church," Williams said. "All the issues have to come out, all the
arguments."</TE>
<TE>   New York Cardinal Edward M. Egan, who has also come under fire for
mishandling sexual abuse cases, said before leaving his archdiocese for
the Rome meeting that he was "deeply sorry" for any errors he made and
vowed to take steps to prevent them in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "You should expect nothing less of me, and the other leaders of our
church," he wrote in a letter Saturday to Catholics in his archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   In St. Peter's Basilica on Sunday, John Paul celebrated Mass for 20
newly ordained priests, telling them that Jesus expects a "higher
loyalty" from them, a rigorous life of poverty and humility.</TE>
<TE>   "He asks of you to be perfect, as your heavenly father is perfect,"
the pope said. "In a word, the Lord wants you to be holy. . . . If every
vocation in the church is in the service of holiness, some--such as the
vocation of ordained ministry and the consecrated life--are that in a
singular way."</TE>

<HD>A Rescuer's Tale: Fight, Then Flight</HD>
<DH>Bobby Green is proud he helped save Reginald Denny. But his brave
act also led him to leave L.A.</DH>
<SE>One in a series on the legacy of the 1992 riots
</SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bobby Green is sitting on his couch in suburban Rialto, talking
about the night 10 years ago that he saved a man's life, a moment that
made him a hero to most and a traitor to others.</LD>
<LD>   Back then, in the first hours of the Los Angeles riots, Green was
sitting on another couch, this one in South-Central Los Angeles. He was
watching a black man on live TV smash a brick, then another brick, into
the head of a white truck driver, who lay writhing on the pavement. It
was happening about half a mile away.</LD>
<LD>   The second brick did it.</LD>
<TE>   "That is e-nough," Green decided. He jumped off the couch and rushed
out the door. It didn't matter that he was black, or that he, like
virtually everyone else in the neighborhood, was mad as hell after that
day's not-guilty verdicts for LAPD officers in the Rodney King beating
trial. He raced to the scene and helped rescue Reginald O. Denny from a
mob of rioters.</TE>
<TE>   That decision still defines Bobby Green. It gives him a credo,
crystallizes what he teaches his children about right and wrong. It's
what he, his wife and his family are most proud of, decorating their
living room with seven of his 14 plaques and commendations. It's the one
thing he thinks about every day he starts work.</TE>
<TE>   And ultimately, that choice was the main reason the man who became a
symbol of post-riot redemption gave up on Los Angeles and moved away.</TE>
<TE>   Denny has done the same thing, settling in Lake Havasu, Ariz., where
he can indulge his love of boating. He declined to be interviewed about
April 29, 1992. Long ago, he'd remarked it was "pretty weird" the way
America heaped celebrity on a truck driver for being in the wrong place
at the wrong time.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't want to look back," said Shelley Montez, his former wife
and mother of his daughter, Ashley, now in high school.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the riots, Bobby Green was a trucker himself, 29,
scraping out a living working part-time. Now he's the father of five, a
man of commanding stature, muscular arms and few words--a man who says he
must remember, must embrace those three hours in his past. They mean so
much to his future.</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell my kids that color is on the outside, not the inside," he
says. "To me, I turned justice around and showed them that all black
people ain't the same as you think.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I am different from the rest of the people" who rioted. "I
saved another man's life because to me, he was another human being who
needed my help."</TE>
<TE>   Why prove it by pushing your way into the fury of Florence and
Normandie?</TE>
<TE>Memories of Injustice</TE>
<TE>   Green leans back in his comfortable, forest-green leather couch, takes
a deep breath, shakes his head. Like Denny, he has a daughter named
Ashley. She's 10, and she has propped herself on the edge of the couch to
eavesdrop. Green's 17-year-old son, Eric, old enough to remember the
commotion at home that night, leans against the wall.</TE>
<TE>   The old names begin to flow. Most of Los Angeles today would need a
glossary to know their importance, but many people still remember the
names as if it were yesterday.</TE>
<TE>   "You know," Green says, "It started with Latasha, and then the King
beating, and then the verdicts. . . ." Anger seeps into his deep voice.
"I don't understand why she got off. Why did Latasha get shot in the back
for stealing orange juice?"</TE>
<TE>   "She" is Soon Ja Du. "Latasha" was Latasha Harlins. Du, a Korean-born
grocer, fatally shot 15-year-old Harlins in the back of the head after a
physical altercation. The fight was prompted by Du's belief the girl was
stealing a bottle of orange juice. A security camera videotaped the scene
and was played during Du's trial. Du was convicted of voluntary
manslaughter. But Superior Court Judge Joyce Karlin, reasoning that Du
was acting out of fear from earlier robberies, sentenced her in November
1991 to five years' probation.</TE>
<TE>   The case exacerbated long-standing tensions between Korean shopkeepers
and their black customers in economically depressed South-Central
neighborhoods, and set the stage for something even worse.</TE>
<TE>   "If she had been a black person," Green said of Du, "she would have
been in jail for murder. That's the kind of justice that's not right. . .
. After Latasha, people started to go crazy. They thought black people
didn't have no justice."</TE>
<TE>   On March 3, 1991, Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and three other white LAPD
officers beat black motorist Rodney G. King as an amateur photographer
captured the repeated baton blows on video.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the officers' trial ended, Bobby and his wife-to-be, Vera,
were sharing a tiny apartment not far from the house where he grew up on
East 62nd Street. "V," as Bobby calls her, had given birth to Ashley a
few months earlier and was working as an office manager on the Westside.
Bobby drove a cement truck for $13 an hour--seasonal work, no benefits.</TE>
<TE>   He had just finished a haul that afternoon when he found his older
brothers transfixed by the TV at their mother's house, the family
headquarters. He sat down on the couch and watched as verdicts acquitting
all four officers of using excessive force were read in a Simi Valley
courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pissed off just like everyone else was pissed off. I was
sitting there, me, my brothers and my son, and I couldn't believe it,"
Green said. "It seemed like there was no justice."</TE>
<TE>   Television soon turned to the street: dusk at the intersection of
Florence and Normandie.</TE>
<TE>   A young black man "had the brick in his hand and hit Reggie. Then he
hit him with the brick again," Green said, becoming indignant. "The man
is already down and I'm thinking, 'Why are you going after him with
another brick and kicking him?' "</TE>
<TE>   Then, Green said, "Something told me to get up." He told Eric he would
be right back. It took him about five minutes to drive to the
intersection, where he ran up to Denny's truck and helped another
rescuer, a woman named Lei Yuille, who was struggling to push Denny into
the cab of his truck.</TE>
<TE>   "I just pushed him over and started driving," Green said. No one in
the crowd stopped the rescue. "They musta thought I was one of the bad
guys too, taking the truck for a joy ride." Even Yuille had that
suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   During the 10-minute drive to the hospital, Yuille cradled Denny's
battered head, telling him, "You're going to make it." Two other
strangers who had come to the rescue, Titus Murphy and Terri Barnett,
turned their Honda's hazard lights on and shouted steering instructions
to Green, who was unable to see clearly through the shattered windshield.</TE>
<TE>   The makeshift entourage dropped Denny off at the emergency room at
Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital. Green, who knew the area's trucking
yards, drove Denny's rig back to its Florence and Manchester home base.
The three other rescuers never even got Green's name, describing him
later as the "young man dressed in black."</TE>
<TE>   The intersection scene, captured in graphic detail by a TV news
helicopter, had been aired on live TV and radio. Vera was driving home
from work "when I hear on the radio that the guy who beat Reginald Denny
was driving away in his truck."</TE>
<TE>   When she got home, Bobby was not there. Eric told her where he had
gone.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you what I said," Vera jokes now, "but it went something
like: 'What the hell does he think he's doing?' "</TE>
<TE>   By the time Bobby came back, there was no use in arguing. They settled
on the couch and watched the riots on TV.</TE>
<TE>Overnight Heroes</TE>
<TE>   It stunned them when Bobby and the three other rescuers became
overnight heroes, their story rising to modern-day parable told by TV
host Phil Donahue, countless other media outlets and the reality show
"How'd They Do That?" A movie producer paid them a few hundred dollars
each for the rights to their story.</TE>
<TE>   At first Bobby wanted to protect his privacy, fearful of too much
hostility in the neighborhood, Vera said.</TE>
<TE>   He insisted TV interviewers use only his silhouette. He had more to
fear when four suspects in the Denny beating were arrested. The young man
he'd seen hitting Denny with the brick, Damian Monroe Williams, faced 17
felony counts carrying possible life sentences.</TE>
<TE>   The Denny case moved through the courts in 1992 and 1993, as tension
clenched an exhausted, riot-raw city. Like the Soon Ja Du and Rodney King
cases, this trial carried heavy symbolism. Some viewed it as the
reverse-race twin of the King beating trial, an example of how the system
treats blacks with excessive criminal charges and unreasonable bail.</TE>
<TE>   A tight-knit protest group dubbed "Free the LA 4+", a reference to the
defendants, jammed the court hearings, distributed buttons and T-shirts
and held rallies, one of which turned violent.</TE>
<TE>   All the while Bobby had been out collecting awards and accolades: "For
his integrity and bravery," said the California Legislature. "For
humanitarianism," read the gold plate from the Los Angeles Urban League.
For heroism, for providing hope in despair, for unselfishness, said
Hollywood, a slew of city councils, a bank, and labor unions. The city of
Opa Locka, Fla., even flew him and Vera out for a parade. Bobby shook
hands with the mayor, who presented him with the key to the city.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as the trial approached, the FBI asked Green if he wanted
protection or another place to live. Vera grew fearful. Bobby had already
heard the rumbling.</TE>
<TE>   "I had threats, word of mouth; it would get to me from the streets,"
he said. "Like, 'Why did I save another person like that and disgrace our
people? Why was I going to court to testify against my people?' "</TE>
<TE>   Police escorted him to the courthouse to testify in August 1993, about
what he saw and why he helped Denny.</TE>
<TE>   Green told the jury that as a fellow trucker, he felt as though he was
being beaten as he watched the attack on Denny.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I was getting hurt," he testified. "I thought he might
die. I went to help."</TE>
<TE>   Green found that the landscape of burned and looted buildings and the
anxiety of the trial had soured him on Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing left. I wanted better for my family," he said. For
months he and Vera struggled.</TE>
<TE>   "Should I stay? Should I move? Should I give L.A. another chance, to
heal up or something?"</TE>
<TE>   They found their answer in the acquittals and scaled-down convictions
of the two main defendants who had beaten Denny, Williams and Henry Keith
Watson.</TE>
<TE>   The justice that Green had on his mind when he ran out his front door
seemed nowhere in sight.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, what [Williams] did was wrong. Just as what is right is right,
what is wrong is wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Green and Vera headed east on the San Bernardino Freeway, vowing to
drive as long as it took to find a suburb with monthly mortgages not that
much higher than the $500 rent they were paying in South-Central. They
were joining the tens of thousands of blacks who left places like L.A.
and Compton during the '90s for the Inland Empire and the northern
suburbs of Palmdale and Lancaster.</TE>
<TE>Feeling of Running Away</TE>
<TE>   He knew he doing the right thing, but one thought nagged at him.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed like I was running."</TE>
<TE>   From?</TE>
<TE>   "My people."</TE>
<TE>   He felt he had no choice. "I wanted to give my family a better life.
What happened at Florence and Normandie, those feelings weren't going to
change soon. I didn't feel it was safe for my kids."</TE>
<TE>   They sought the same thing the other rescuers and Denny
sought--anonymity. They were successful. Soon after the trial, the
rescuers lost contact with each other. They haven't talked in close to
eight years.</TE>
<TE>   "We never became buddies or anything like that," said Lei Yuille, who
still works in the Los Angeles area as a registered dietitian. "We were
four strangers, brought together once. . . . I have really tried not to
relive it."</TE>
<TE>   The rights to the movie that was never made expired. "It would have
been too violent," Yuille thinks.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby and Vera last saw Denny at a picnic the summer after the riots,
thrown by Denny's old employer, Transit Mixed. A few weeks ago Vera
shuffled through some drawers to show off a photo of her and Reggie. He's
holding a check for $100,000 in donations that had flowed into a company
fund for his recovery.</TE>
<TE>   The Greens' Rialto neighborhood is a cluster of neat suburban tract
homes in the racially mixed flatlands of the Inland Empire: cul-de-sacs,
midsized trees, lots of chain restaurants and big-box stores. The schools
are better and teachers take more time with the Greens' kids, who every
so often take one of their dad's trophies to show off during a class
history lesson.</TE>
<TE>   It's secure, it's safe, said Vera, walking out with Bobby to their
backyard, plush with a newly laid carpet of sod. He still comments on how
odd it is to hear chirping birds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice, peaceful, quiet--ain't no color lines out here," he says.
He mentions that a police officer who lives on the street is especially
friendly.</TE>
<TE>   The reason Bobby Green thinks about the past every day he goes to work
lies in the company he works for. It's called Cemex Co. It used to be
known as Transit Mixed, the company that employed Denny.</TE>
<TE>   Every time Green pulls his rig into the firm's Los Angeles yard he
finds a sense of closure in completing the route Reggie never got to
finish.</TE>
<TE>   "I think about the bond every day," he says. "I want to keep our names
alive. . . . It's nice to work for the same company of the man I saved."</TE>

<HD>Labor's Love of 401(k)s Thwarts Bid for Reform</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>When lawmakers declared they would seek sweeping new protections
for the nation's retirement system in the wake of Enron's collapse in
December, you could have predicted some of the opponents: corporate types
interested in preserving arrangements that ensure cushy tax breaks, free
marketeers fearful of any extension of government power and so forth.</LD>
<LD>   But add to the opposition an unusual ally: the American labor
movement.</LD>
<LD>   Top labor leaders quietly refused to support the most stringent
congressional proposal, one that would have taken an important first step
toward affording 401(k) accounts the same protections that have long
applied to traditional pensions.</LD>
<TE>   In interviews, officials with the nation's largest labor group, the
13-million member AFL-CIO, insisted their opposition to a so-called
company stock cap was largely tactical. They feared the measure would
galvanize corporate opposition against any reform.</TE>
<TE>   But the officials conceded they also were influenced by internal polls
showing that union members are deeply enamored of their 401(k)s, often to
a greater extent than they are of their financially more important and
far less risky union-won pensions.</TE>
<TE>   "Our people just value their ability to make their own personal
decisions. They trust their own investment decisions more than they do
anybody else's," said Jerry Shea, chief policy advisor to AFL-CIO
President John J. Sweeney.</TE>
<TE>   Worker infatuation with 401(k)s and organized labor's opposition to
strict limits on how they can be invested illustrate how extensively the
investor culture of the 1990s penetrated the nation. And continued
enthusiasm for individual retirement accounts even after two years of
stock declines suggests how powerfully the idea of hitting it rich in the
markets still grips America.</TE>
<TE>   The combination, many retirement policy experts fear, could prove
fatal to any kind of thorough-going reform.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a fundamental disconnect between people's fondness for
401(k)s as a personal investment vehicle and the fact that they are,
first and foremost, key elements of our nation's retirement system," said
J. Mark Iwry, who as the Treasury Department's tax benefits counsel from
1995 to 2000 was one of the nation's top retirement plan regulators.</TE>
<TE>   "The 401(k) would not exist without the generous tax advantages
provided by law. Those advantages are designed to ensure Americans have
adequate and secure income to live on when they retire.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes no sense to provide tax breaks, then do nothing to protect
the accounts from the kind of imprudent investment that occurred at
Enron," Iwry said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 20,000 Enron employees lost most of their retirement savings
when the Texas energy giant collapsed, dragging the workers' 401(k)
accounts, which had been chockablock with company stock, down with it.
The losses were particularly galling because they came as top executives
were simultaneously selling off large blocks of their own stock and
encouraging subordinates to keep on buying.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting public outcry sparked broad initial support for a
proposal by Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Jon Corzine (D-N.J.) to
slap a 20% cap on the amount of company stock permitted in a 401(k).</TE>
<TE>   Policy experts said the stock cap idea represented a first, tentative
attempt to cope with what amounts to a sea change in the nation's
retirement system over the last two decades, one with potentially dire
consequences for how the baby boom generation will live once it stops
working.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most advanced industrial nations, which have public retirement
systems designed to replace most of a worker's income when he or she
stops working, America's Social Security system replaces only up to about
40% of pre-retirement income. Americans are expected to look elsewhere
for the rest.</TE>
<TE>   For much of the postwar period, the "elsewhere" was chiefly the
private pension.</TE>
<TE>   Employers managed pots of money to ensure they could pay retirees.
Washington encouraged the process by offering big tax breaks while
protecting workers by imposing a 10% cap on company stock, requiring
broad diversification of investments and guaranteeing payment of
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in the early 1980s, the government also began encouraging
individuals to save for retirement by offering tax breaks for salting
away funds in 401(k)s and similar accounts. In these, the risk for their
performance rested with individuals rather than employers. But Washington
did little to regulate them largely on the theory they were mere
sidelights to pensions.</TE>
<TE>   However, the longest bull stock market in U.S. history turned the
retirement world on its head by convincing people they could use the
individual accounts to take care of their own retirement needs.</TE>
<TE>   By now, there are more people dependent on individual accounts than
pensions, more money going into them and bigger tax breaks devoted to
encouraging them, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration estimates the government will provide $60
billion in tax breaks this year underwriting 401(k) accounts, compared
with $53 billion on traditional pensions. These add up to the single
biggest tax break that the government offers--almost double the much
better-known mortgage interest deduction.</TE>
<TE>   In the popular imagination, they have taken over so thoroughly that,
despite stark evidence to the contrary, many Americans believe 401(k)s
will be the chief source of their retirement income.</TE>
<TE>   "People have some deep misunderstandings about these accounts," said
top Washington pollster Mark Mellman. That includes union members with
top-flight traditional pensions as well as 401(k)s.</TE>
<TE>   "We've polled employee groups with pensions that guarantee they'll get
70% or 80% of their income after retirement and 401(k)s with only $10,000
or $15,000 in them, and three quarters or more still think their 401(k)s
will provide most of their retirement benefits," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, despite the wild popularity of 401(k) accounts, the average
account balance for all Americans at the end of the longest boom in U.S.
history was barely $49,000--not enough to even begin delivering an
adequate retirement income.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absurd, but people have been led to believe their 401(k)s will
take care of them," Mellman said.</TE>
<TE>   That was the backdrop when unions began backing away from their
initial support of the proposed 20% limit on company stock in 401(k)
accounts .</TE>
<TE>   AFL-CIO officials convened a series of private meetings with affiliate
unions in January and February to gauge support and found very little.</TE>
<TE>   "There were people there," said Robert Patrician, a research economist
with the Communications Workers of America, "who felt that members did
not want to be restricted in investing their tax-advantaged dollars." Nor
did the union officials want to be the ones to tell the members what was
good for them.</TE>
<TE>   Officials also began hearing from members like Joseph M. Furst, a
former General Electric salesman from Rocky Hill, Conn., who adamantly
opposes applying to 401(k)s the same rules the government imposes on
traditional pensions.</TE>
<TE>   "The government wants to mandate everything," the 62-year-old retiree
complained. "They mandate the design of your car. They mandate the design
of your toilet. Now they want to mandate where you can invest your
money."</TE>
<TE>   Furst said he has doubled the value of his 401(k) since taking early
retirement five years ago by putting virtually all of it into GE stock.
He said he has no worries he could suffer a fate similar to that of Enron
workers.</TE>
<TE>   The combination of reluctant union leaders and angry union members
proved potent. Lawmakers quickly rallied around a compromise that, by
focusing only on firms without traditional pensions, left organized labor
largely untouched.</TE>
<TE>   Under a measure advanced by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.),
companies that don't have pensions like those offered by most unionized
firms would have their right to use company stock in retirement plans
somewhat restricted. In addition, the firms would have to let employees
unload company stock from their 401(k)s after three years.</TE>
<TE>   But the idea of an outright cap on company stock would be dropped.</TE>
<TE>   A defeated Corzine said in a statement last week that "as a pure
policy matter" he still believes a cap is the best approach. But he
added, "I support the Kennedy proposal as a viable compromise . . . to
protect workers' retirement savings through diversification."</TE>

<HD>Rapid-Fire Coup Caught Chavez Foes Off Guard</HD>
<DH>Venezuela: Despite much planning and U.S. contacts, plotters'
infighting led to failure.</DH>

<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela
</DL>
<LD>The president bade farewell to his honor guard, young men armed
with semiautomatic rifles who wept because Hugo Chavez was leaving,
seemingly forever. The soldiers wanted to fight, to turn the Miraflores
palace into a bunker against their enemies, but the president wouldn't
let them.</LD>
<LD>   "Your lives are just beginning," Chavez said, according to his later
account.</LD>
<LD>   At that moment on the night of April 11, it appeared that Chavez's
three-year reign as Venezuela's strongman president was over. The
country's richest business leaders, its largest labor confederation, its
top military men and its most influential media had all joined forces
against him. They had Chavez cornered. And he knew it.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the top leaders of the anti-Chavez alliance had talked, at one
time or another, to representatives of the United States government. They
had met with embassy officials, Pentagon analysts, military attaches and
even trade representatives. The Venezuelans left those meetings
encouraged. Although the Americans said they wouldn't approve of a coup,
it was clear the most powerful nation on Earth wanted Chavez out too.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez left the palace and a short while later was in the custody of
his generals and admirals. For months they had worked to drive him from
office, but a surprising series of events--including the shooting of
anti-Chavez protesters--had brought the president down so quickly that
few of the movement's leaders had a firm idea of what should happen next.</TE>
<TE>   Interviews with opposition leaders and U.S. officials make clear that
the campaign to oust Chavez was centered almost entirely in Caracas, the
capital, among Venezuelans who had grown tired of the president's
heavy-handed rule. But key chapters also took place in Washington and in
the Caracas offices of the U.S. military attache.</TE>
<TE>   Slightly more than two days after he was driven from office, Hugo
Chavez staged the most lightning-fast political resurrection in modern
Latin American history. He triumphantly returned to Miraflores palace,
embraced by his honor guard and by some of the thousands of people who
had come to greet him.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew there would be a reaction," Chavez would tell reporters the
day after his reinstatement. "What surprised me was the speed and
efficiency of the response."</TE>
<TE>U.S. Official Met With Anti-Chavez Forces</TE>
<TE>   Chavez's return was a vindication for his most devoted supporters, the
poor of Caracas' hillside slums, who see him as a symbol of hope despite
his abundant quirks and flaws. It was also an embarrassment for the Bush
administration and its point man in the region, a Cuban American who has
never tried to hide his dislike for Chavez, Fidel Castro's most ardent
ally in the Western Hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   In the months before the coup, Assistant Secretary of State for
Western Hemisphere Affairs Otto J. Reich met with several influential
figures in Venezuela, the world's fourth-largest oil exporter and a key
U.S. supplier, according to American officials and dissidents in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Reich met in February with a key figure in Chavez's fall, Carlos
Ortega, head of Venezuela's largest labor confederation and the man who
called a general strike that catalyzed the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'The United States is not going to recognize a de facto
government, or a government that comes [to power] via a coup,' " Ortega
recalled in an interview Saturday. "That was their position."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, after the uprising put business leader Pedro Carmona in
power April 12, the White House blamed Chavez for the crisis and gave
tacit backing to Carmona's government. Carmona swore himself in as
president--without any apparent legal authority to do so--and dissolved a
democratically elected legislature.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration should have laid low for at least 48 hours," said
one Bush administration advisor. But its "glandular reaction," the
official said, "was too much to hold back."</TE>
<TE>A Deluge of Rumors and Conspiracy Theories</TE>
<TE>   In the days after Chavez's return to power, Caracas was awash in
rumors, all claiming to be the real story behind why the uprising
succeeded and why it failed just as quickly.</TE>
<TE>   The small band of reporters who cover the Venezuelan military
exchanged stories about blond men, perhaps Americans, seen walking
alongside the rebellious officers during the uprising (a story later
dismissed by at least one leader of the coup).</TE>
<TE>   There were rumors, too, about Cuban attempts to intervene in the
crisis--later confirmed, to some extent, by Castro himself. (The Cuban
leader said his government contacted the ambassadors of 21 countries in
an attempt to get a plane to Venezuela to rescue Chavez.)</TE>
<TE>   In Caracas, one journalist placed oil interests at the center of the
coup and its most disastrous missteps, naming the 32-year-old scion of a
Venezuelan oil family as its behind-the-scenes mastermind.</TE>
<TE>   And finally, there was the most fantastic conspiracy theory of all:
that Chavez, in a Machiavellian masterstroke, had somehow staged the coup
and his own arrest to ferret out his opponents.</TE>
<TE>   That rumor, like most of the others, did contain at least one small
grain of truth: There is little doubt that Chavez himself, and his deep
reservoirs of charisma and cunning, shaped the final outcome of the
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   All the conspiracy theories, however, gloss over a central, undeniable
fact: that the struggle over Chavez's presidency was really about the
divisions in Venezuelan society, fissures of race and class that have
only been heightened by the failed coup.</TE>
<TE>   "The people wanted their loco back," said a hotel bellman in central
Caracas, beaming the day after Chavez returned. "They wanted to see him
back on his horse, in the saddle. And there he is."</TE>
<TE>From Coup Plotter to Coup Target</TE>
<TE>   Hugo Chavez is what Venezuelans call a bachaco, a man of mixed race.
He was born in 1954, the son of provincial schoolteachers. Accepted into
the Venezuelan military academy in 1971, he graduated four years later as
a second lieutenant and began a quick ascent through the ranks of the
army.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, he joined other young officers in forming the "Bolivarian
Revolutionary Movement," named for Simon Bolivar, the 19th century father
of Venezuelan independence. The young officers were nationalists angered
by the corrupt, two-party system that had dominated their country for
generations.</TE>
<TE>   Their restlessness only grew as Venezuela sank deep into an economic
crisis. In 1989, hundreds of people were killed in a Caracas riot against
the austerity measures taken by then-President Carlos Andres Perez. Three
years later, Chavez led a military coup against Perez's government.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Col. Chavez and his red-beret paratroopers traveled from their
base in provincial Maracay and surrounded the presidential palace. But
the coup quickly collapsed. Before surrendering, Chavez took to the
airwaves, explained the reasons for his uprising and announced that he
would give up the struggle against corruption only "for now."</TE>
<TE>   The speech helped make Chavez a cult hero to many Venezuelans. After
two years in prison, he was freed and traveled the country making more
speeches, then forged an alliance with leftist and other politicians. He
was elected president in a landslide in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "He had all this popularity; he had the time to change things with
people accepting whatever he said," said Eric Ekvall, a political
consultant here. "People really wanted a change from all the corruption."</TE>
<TE>   Once in power, Chavez proceeded to reshape Venezuelan political life.
The constitution was rewritten and the country renamed "the Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela." Elections were quickly held for a new, unicameral
legislature, bringing a pro-Chavez majority to power. All the members of
the new Supreme Court were selected by pro-Chavez legislators and
officials.</TE>
<TE>   But there was little serious economic reform. Despite a rhetoric that
borrowed heavily from Marxist ideology, Chavez did not nationalize any
businesses, or do much to better the lot of the overwhelming number of
Venezuelans who are poor. When the country slid into a recession last
year, Chavez slashed government spending, following the recommendations
of the International Monetary Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuelans came to know Chavez for his repeated television
appearances, monologues that could last for hours. He might launch an
attack on an opposition journalist or the "oligarchs" who controlled the
nation's economy. Sometimes, he would make funny references to his family
life. One Valentine's Day, he looked into the camera and said to his
wife, in a seductive voice, "Marisabel, you're going to get yours
tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Abroad, Chavez cast himself as an anti-imperialist. He sold oil to
Cuba at bargain-basement prices and, in August 2000, became the first
foreign head of state to travel to Iraq and meet with President Saddam
Hussein since the Persian Gulf War. Some have accused him of offering
support to guerrillas in neighboring Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   None of this sat well with the generals and admirals who run
Venezuela's armed forces, many of whom trained in the United States and
have friendships with American colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Berenice Gomez, who covers the military for the Caracas daily Ultimas
Noticias, said military discontent with Chavez was obvious almost from
the moment he took power.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, they would just leak stories to us" about Chavez using
military facilities for political purposes, and other minor scandals,
Gomez said. They would complain about Chavez making their soldiers work
on social projects such as road repair.</TE>
<TE>   "The generals would say, 'My job is to defend the fatherland. It isn't
to clean the streets,' " Gomez said.</TE>
<TE>   By June 2001, the generals and admirals had begun to meet to consider
how Chavez could be forced out of office, according to interviews with
dissident officers.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized I had to make a decision and act like a patriotic
Venezuelan," Rear Adm. Carlos Molina Tamayo said in an interview last
week. Molina said he had come to believe Chavez was a "Communist."</TE>
<TE>   The efforts of the anti-Chavez generals and admirals quickly became
known to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   "They [would] also come to us and say, 'We don't want your approval,
we just want you to know,' " said one U.S. official. "Our policy has
been, we don't even want to know."</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, Chavez's government was beginning to butt heads
with Washington over the U.S. military mission that occupies a small
building on the sprawling Fuerte Tiuna military base, Venezuela's
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the Venezuelan armed forces announced that the mission
would be shut down. The government said it needed the office space, but
observers here took it as a clear sign that Chavez wanted to distance his
generals from their American allies.</TE>
<TE>   Discontent with Chavez was building among other groups as well. The
middle-class intellectuals and professionals who had at first delighted
in Chavez's talk of restoring "national honor" watched in dismay as
Chavez's supporters formed "Bolivarian circles," muscle groups that
intimidated government opponents with threats of physical harm.</TE>
<TE>   "For the last year or so, [Chavez] has essentially thumbed his nose at
this growing opposition," said Ekvall, the political consultant. "It has
become increasingly clear to the opposition that he's not going to
change."</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of several months, U.S. officials met with
representatives of nearly every sector of the growing anti-Chavez
coalition, according to U.S. government sources.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Enrique Otero, executive director of the Caracas daily El
Nacional and a Chavez opponent, had "informal conversations" with U.S.
government officials in Washington in November. When the subject of
Chavez's ouster came up, "they always said it had to be constitutional,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   But another Venezuelan leader who visited Washington for an official
meeting said he concluded after talks with U.S. officials that the
Americans would not necessarily punish the leaders of a government that
overthrew Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   This civic leader, who asked to remain unidentified, said he was
struck by the fact that U.S. officials have publicly and repeatedly
expressed their opposition to Chavez. The civic leader noticed that the
new Bush administration team on Latin America included a number of Cuban
Americans such as Otto Reich.</TE>
<TE>'Careless' Conversations With U.S. Officials</TE>
<TE>   Some career officials in the U.S. government have told congressional
aides that American officials in numerous agencies were talking to
Venezuelan opposition figures--and that some of the conversations were
"careless." It was feared that they did not emphasize as strongly as they
should have the U.S. opposition to a coup, the aides said.</TE>
<TE>   One high-ranking Bush administration advisor added that he believed
Washington did not do enough to discourage the idea that the U.S. would
support an anti-Chavez coup.</TE>
<TE>   By November, communications between U.S. officials and dissident
officers had grown so frequent that then-U.S. Ambassador to Venezuela
Donna J. Hrinak took the unusual step of asking the American military
attache to cease contacts with the dissidents, according to a report
first published in the Washington Post and later confirmed by U.S.
diplomats.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, Gen. Lucas Romero Rincon, the Venezuelan army
chief of staff, was traveling to Washington where he met with a Pentagon
policy aide and discussed the possibility of a change of government, U.S.
officials said. Today, Rincon professes loyalty to Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   A one-day national strike paralyzed the country on Dec. 10, and major
protests swept the streets in January and February.</TE>
<TE>   By then, with Venezuela's economic crisis growing and Chavez's
approval rating plummeting to about 30%, the long-simmering resentment in
the military had finally become public.</TE>
<TE>   "President Chavez, for the good of the country and for the love of the
armed forces, resign peacefully and take responsibility for your
failure," said Air Force Gen. Roman Gomez Ruiz, one of four officers who
were the first to publicly air their criticism of Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez made it clear that he would brook no dissent--he called the
officers traitors, threw some into custody for a few days, and forced all
to quit the armed forces.</TE>
<TE>Dispute at Oil Firm Galvanizes Chavez Foes</TE>
<TE>   The dissident military leaders, and other opposition figures,
increased their efforts to seek outside help.</TE>
<TE>   "Several weeks before, a lot of these guys came to talk to Otto
[Reich], asking what can the U.S. do," the high-ranking Bush
administration advisor said. "I believe Otto when he says he didn't give
them a green light [for a coup] and didn't wink. But what he didn't say
was more important than what he did."</TE>
<TE>   Events in Venezuela began to move quickly, accelerated by a dispute at
the government-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela. In February,
Chavez fired company President Guaicaipuro Lameda, a retired general, and
replaced him with a former Communist Party militant.</TE>
<TE>   Lameda would soon join the long list of Venezuelan dissidents who
spoke with U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   The oil dispute proved to be the catalyst that united all the
anti-Chavez forces. In protest against Chavez's actions, officials and
workers at the company launched a production slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   Ortega, the labor leader, joined forces with Carmona, head of
Venezuela's largest business federation, to call an "indefinite general
strike" in support of the oil workers.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, April 11, the third day of the strike, about 200,000
people marched in Caracas, calling on Chavez to resign.</TE>
<TE>   The march began peacefully but degenerated into violence, with
protesters clashing with police. At some point, people near the front of
the march decided to change the route and head for the presidential
palace.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there was any intention of a coup," Ortega said.</TE>
<TE>   A block or so from the palace, as the marchers approached an overpass,
shooting erupted. Snipers were spotted on rooftops. Video captured by a
Venezuelan television crew shows a group of Chavez supporters standing on
the overpass, opening fire with handguns.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 15 people were killed. Chavez blocked TV coverage of the
violence, but the "massacre," as Chavez opponents soon called it, had
already given the military high command the moral authority it needed to
break with the president once and for all.</TE>
<TE>   "If the armed forces hadn't intervened, the massacre would have been
worse," Ortega said.</TE>
<TE>   At the palace, Chavez sent his military chief of staff, Rincon, to
talk with the military officers who had gathered at Fuerte Tiuna to
demand his ouster. Rincon called back with "bad news."</TE>
<TE>   "They're fighting among themselves," Rincon said, according to
Chavez's later account. "And they insist that you resign."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez said he told Rincon by telephone that he would "abandon" his
job as president. He then left the palace to negotiate the terms under
which he would do so. Rincon took to the airwaves to announce a short
while later that Chavez had resigned.</TE>
<TE>   According to press reports here, one of the military leaders gathered
at Fuerte Tiuna then called Carmona, the mild-mannered business leader,
who was meeting with other opposition leaders at a Caracas television
station.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona quietly left the meeting without telling his allies what they
would find out a few hours later--he was about to become Venezuela's next
president.</TE>
<TE>Military Refused to Let Chavez Leave Venezuela</TE>
<TE>   Late Thursday and early Friday morning, the military leaders meeting
with Chavez made the first of several missteps that would lead to
Chavez's return: They refused to allow the president to leave the
country, his principal condition for submitting his resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Hard-liners argued that Chavez should be prosecuted for the killings
outside the palace, according to press reports here. But Chavez's refusal
to sign any resignation letter placed the military in an awkward
position. They were holding in custody the man who was still, legally,
their commander in chief.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them there was no way I would sign the letter, no matter how
much they pressured me," Chavez would say later. "I told them I was a
prisoner president."</TE>
<TE>   Over the next 48 hours, Chavez's refusal to formally resign--as he had
suggested Thursday he would do--would tear apart the coalition against
him.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona, the interim president, further divided the coalition with a
series of controversial decrees, all drafted in private by a small circle
of aides.</TE>
<TE>Interim Leader Was 'Placed in a Trap'</TE>
<TE>   According to columnist Patricia Poleo of the Caracas daily El Nuevo
Pais, one man played a manipulative role in the decrees: Isaac Perez
Recao, 32, whose family owns a controlling stake in the petrochemical
company Venoco. The same company has also employed Carmona.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, too, there was concern. A close advisor to the Bush
administration said it appeared that anti-Chavez hard-liners, including
Perez Recao, were telling Carmona what to do. When the military realized
this, the advisor added, "they looked at it and said, 'We've lost
control.' "</TE>
<TE>   Inside Miraflores palace, several members of the anti-Chavez coalition
felt they were being aced out of power by Carmona.</TE>
<TE>   "The impression I had was of a group of people standing around this
enormous cake, each one of them rubbing their hands," said Miguel Angel
Castillo, an attorney for one of the anti-Chavez military officers. "They
were all wondering how big of a piece they were going to get."</TE>
<TE>   Carmona had named a government that included several members of the
ultraconservative Roman Catholic group Opus Dei but not key military and
labor members of the coalition. Even worse, he had decreed the
dissolution of the National Assembly, the Supreme Court and the dismissal
of every mayor and governor.</TE>
<TE>   "Carmona was really placed in a trap," said Anibal Romero, a political
science professor here. "He couldn't leave the National Assembly in power
and govern the country, because it was full of Chavez supporters. But if
he dissolved it, he would be declared anti-democratic."</TE>
<TE>   In the eyes of many in Venezuela and abroad, the popular uprising
against Chavez had given birth to a right-wing dictatorship.
International condemnation--from the governments of Mexico, Argentina and
other nations--was not long in coming.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday morning, April 13, recently appointed U.S. Ambassador
Charles Shapiro met with Carmona. The State Department's Reich had
instructed Shapiro to "warn" Carmona that if he did not reinstate the
National Assembly, "they would be in violation of their own
constitution."</TE>
<TE>   But Carmona "chose not to accept what he called our suggestions," a
senior Bush administration official said.</TE>
<TE>U.S. Ambassador's Remarks in Dispute</TE>
<TE>   Carmona has a different version of the events. He told the Guardian of
London newspaper that the U.S. ambassador offered no guidance on whether
he should reinstate the legislature.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't say yes or no," Carmona said when asked if Shapiro had made
such a statement. "It was just a normal conversation."</TE>
<TE>   As the U.S. ambassador left the palace, a crowd of Chavez supporters
was beginning to gather outside. Members of Chavez's family, and his
deposed vice president, had been calling radio and television stations to
say the president had not resigned.</TE>
<TE>   By Saturday afternoon, a large crowd had also started to form outside
Fuerte Tiuna, where it was rumored that Chavez was being held. Two tanks
guarded the entrance. "Why did they organize this coup against the
people?" asked Juan Manriquez, a bus driver. Multitudes of Chavez
die-hards across Venezuela were asking the same question.</TE>
<TE>   Caracas slum-dwellers took portraits of Chavez from their homes and
carried them about the city, as if the images of their leader possessed
the power to bring him back from political death.</TE>
<TE>   "The rich are trying, again, to take away our hope," Manriquez said.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, looting and rioting broke out in several corners of Caracas,
unrest that was almost completely ignored by the nation's anti-Chavez
television stations. Reports of fatalities ranged from nine to 30,
including a policeman. Despite the news blackout, word spread of a major
crack in the military's support for the new government: The general in
command of Chavez's former paratroop unit declared himself in rebellion
against Carmona.</TE>
<TE>   Having gathered inside the presidential palace for a swearing-in
ceremony, the men and women who were to be the country's new Cabinet
ministers fled in panic when a rumor spread that pro-Chavez planes were
about to bomb the building. One of them left behind a presidential sash,
ordered long ago from Spain and made with an adjustable strap, to fit any
candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez fever soon spread through the high command. Within hours, "the
prisoner president" was a free man, word of the events in Caracas having
reached the soldiers and officers who were holding him captive at an
island military compound--the last of five different sites where he had
been held.</TE>
<TE>   The president boarded a helicopter and returned triumphant to the
Miraflores palace just after 3 a.m., Sunday, April 14, where he was
embraced by many of the thousands massed outside.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Venezuela remains convulsed by the events that began April 11.
There are plans for a truth commission to sort out who ordered the
shooting of the anti-Chavez protesters. Dozens of military officers and
civilians, including Carmona, remain under arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Labor leaders announced Saturday that they will go ahead with a
massive May Day march that may once again bring thousands of anti-Chavez
protesters to the center of Caracas.</TE>
<TE>   "If we as Venezuelans don't come together, then, sadly, painfully,
inevitably we will travel down a path of a civil war," said labor leader
Ortega, who spent days on the run after the failed coup in the face of
death threats. "And I believe that a great majority of Venezuelans don't
want this."</TE>

<HD>Schroeder's Party Loses in Eastern State</HD>
<DH>Germany: Victory by conservatives gives a boost to chancellor's
challenger in fall national elections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MAGDEBURG, Germany
</DL>
<LD>Here in the troubled eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, where
Germany's woes are written large and suffered widely, voters angered by
high unemployment, mounting debt and western arrogance voted a government
aligned with federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder out of office Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The surprisingly strong protest vote cast a pall over the Social
Democrats and can be expected to give momentum to Schroeder's challenger
in the Sept. 22 national elections, archconservative Bavarian Gov. Edmund
Stoiber of the Christian Social Union.</LD>
<LD>   In the last state balloting before the increasingly tight federal
race, the electoral upheaval in Saxony-Anhalt also gave Stoiber's party
and its bigger allies, the Christian Democrats, a slight majority in the
upper house of Parliament--a shift likely to paralyze initiatives by
Schroeder.</LD>
<TE>   With its shiny new exteriors and bankrupt core, Saxony-Anhalt is a
veritable shrine to the failures of the post-reunification policies of
Germany's two major parties. Massive federal spending intended to lift
living standards in the east was focused on the construction of modern
highways, sleek office buildings and glitzy shopping malls, while the
nationwide labor-market restrictions that discourage job-creating
investment have persisted in Saxony-Anhalt through five years of
governance by the Christian Democrats and eight under the Social
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's vote for a new state parliament and leadership made it clear
that Germans, at least in the more volatile east, want change on more
than just the surface. Stoiber's political allies won nearly 38% of the
votes--up 16 percentage points from the 1998 state election--which
together with the pro-business Free Democrats' 13% gave them the majority
coalition needed to govern.</TE>
<TE>   "Our state and the country as a whole need to switch directions. We
can't keep throwing taxpayers' money at every problem. We need to attract
private investment and entrepreneurs," said Burkhard Kreuzmann, who runs
his own plumbing business.</TE>
<TE>   With more than 20% of its residents jobless and an equal number in
state-funded make-work programs, Saxony-Anhalt is hardly a microcosm of
the federal economy, which has suffered flat growth over the last year
but appears to be emerging from its dubious role as the economic laggard
of the European Union. But the problems here are replicated in other
eastern states, where the more volatile electorate might wield
disproportionate clout in the close contest shaping up between Schroeder
and Stoiber.</TE>
<TE>   The Bavarian challenger insisted that the vote here was "a very clear
signal for Berlin" that Germans are fed up with their leftist leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Many pollsters and analysts had expected the Social Democrats and the
former Communists of the Party of Democratic Socialism to each garner
about a quarter of the state vote and align to keep Schroeder's party in
power. But both barely reached 20%, hinting at broad dissatisfaction with
the tax-and-spend approach the leftists have relied on in the states they
govern.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome was even worse for the environmentalist Greens, who share
power with Schroeder's party at the federal level. They fell far short of
the 5% needed to win seats in any state parliament, with only a 1.9%
share. After the Greens' unbroken tumble in popularity over the last
three years, the vote here may herald the political demise of the party
even though the country's most popular figure, Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer, is a member.</TE>
<TE>   The man expected to emerge as Saxony-Anhalt's governor after coalition
negotiations is a 66-year-old gynecology professor, Wolfgang Boehmer, who
led the Christian Democrats to victory with promises to create jobs,
justice and hope. The young, able-bodied and best-educated among eastern
Germans have been fleeing in droves since reunification in 1990, having
despaired of finding employment or wage parity. Saxony-Anhalt, which is
burdened with the highest jobless rate and lowest per capita earnings of
all 16 states, has seen one-fifth of its population move west over the
last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Another winning force was the Free Democrats, who tripled their share
of the vote from the last election with a warning that Germany needs to
make itself more attractive to employers if it wants to create jobs. That
is a message likely to get attention across this country, which is
saddled with 10% unemployment overall and deepening public debt.</TE>
<TE>   Defeated state leader Reinhard Hoeppner announced minutes after the
first results were released that he was withdrawing from public life. The
Social Democrats' national chairman, Franz Muentefering, was left to
execute damage control, insisting to reporters that this state is hardly
a barometer of the national political mood.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the biggest loser in the intensifying federal campaign was
Ronald Schill, head of the new Law and Order party, who was weighing a
national candidacy if his party won 20%. It fell just below the 5%
threshold.</TE>

<HD>Socialists Win in Hungary Balloting</HD>
<DH>Voting: Alliance led by former Communists gains majority in
parliamentary elections, and prime minister Orban concedes defeat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUDAPEST, Hungary
</DL>
<LD>A center-left alliance led by ex-Communists won a majority of seats
in Hungarian parliamentary elections Sunday, setting the stage for Peter
Medgyessy, a former finance minister and banker, to become this country's
next prime minister.</LD>
<LD>   "So, we have won!" a jubilant Medgyessy declared to supporters at the
headquarters of the Hungarian Socialist Party.</LD>
<LD>   During a harsh and divisive campaign, Socialist supporters complained
that they were often described by Prime Minister Viktor Orban and other
leaders of his center-right FiDeSz-Hungarian Civic Party not as the
opposition but as enemies.</LD>
<TE>   Medgyessy, 59, pledged Sunday night that he will serve all citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "My conviction is that after forming the government, we must unify the
country," he said. "I repeat what I said several times: It's my intention
to be the prime minister of 10 million Hungarians, not two times 5
million. There are 10 million important people in Hungary, regardless of
whom they voted for."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's balloting was the second and final round of voting for 386
parliamentary seats. The Socialists and a small party allied with them,
the Alliance of Free Democrats, won 198 seats, while a FiDeSz-led
alliance took 188, the national electoral commission announced.</TE>
<TE>   As leader of the largest single parliamentary bloc, Orban could still
theoretically be asked by Hungarian President Ferenc Madl to try to form
a government by wooing sufficient support from Free Democrats or
breakaway Socialists to form a parliamentary majority.</TE>
<TE>   But the Socialists and Free Democrats, who ruled in a coalition
government from 1994 to 1998, have already formed a strong alliance, and
it appeared virtually certain Sunday that Medgyessy will head the next
government.</TE>
<TE>   Some supporters of Orban expressed hope Sunday night that he could
somehow remain prime minister, but he conceded defeat in a telephone call
to Medgyessy and then in a speech to his backers.</TE>
<TE>   A Socialist-led government is not expected to differ greatly in policy
terms from the outgoing center-right coalition. During their rule, the
Socialists and Free Democrats showed a strong commitment to a market
economy. Joining the European Union in 2004 is sure to be a top goal for
the new government, as it was for Orban's. The Socialists have also
called for business-friendly tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   But many FiDeSz supporters deeply dislike the Socialists because they
are led by former Communists.</TE>
<TE>   "It disturbs my sense of justice that such a party comes to power,"
Daniel Szabo, 24, a university student attending a postelection FiDeSz
rally, told an American reporter Sunday night. "They went against the
1956 [democratic] revolution and ran a dictatorship in Hungary. These are
the same people. . . . You never had a dictatorship. You don't know what
it's like for people to have their teeth kicked out."</TE>
<TE>   Those now leading the Socialists "are not the same people as in 1956"
when Hungarians rose up against Soviet-backed Communist rule, but "the
idea is the same," Szabo said.</TE>
<TE>   Such views are strenuously disputed by Socialist supporters, many of
whom were turned off by the nationalist and religious tinges of Orban's
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Gyorgy Partos, 60, a pensioner who was a Communist Party member for 25
years, said the Socialists have become a "social democratic" party like
the British Labor Party or Germany's Social Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "This change didn't happen just in the past 10 years," Partos said.
"It started much earlier in Hungary. The 1956 revolution was made by
Communists. The executed Prime Minister Imre Nagy [who led the
pro-democracy revolt] was also a Communist. Communist leaders initiated
those economic changes from the 1960s, so Hungary could get away from the
Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   "When the whole Communist world collapsed economically," he added,
"and the Soviet Union collapsed as well, that [reformist] trend
succeeded, and it won again tonight in this election. . . . The stock
market will go up tomorrow because the Socialists won."</TE>
<TE>   Medgyessy served Hungary's Communist government as finance minister
and deputy prime minister in the late 1980s, then was finance minister
again from 1996 to 1998 under the Socialist-led government. During much
of the 1990s, he worked as a banker.</TE>
<TE>   Although he was a member of the Communist Party, which was officially
called the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, Medgyessy has never joined
its successor, the Hungarian Socialist Party, but was chosen as its
candidate for prime minister nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   In his concession speech, Orban emphasized the accomplishments of his
government in a way that sounded like the opening volley of a campaign to
retake power in elections four years from now. The outgoing government
was especially popular among entrepreneurs, who found new opportunities
in an expanding economy, and among young people enthusiastic about having
in Orban a charismatic leader not tainted by association with the
Communist past.</TE>
<TE>   Orban thanked his youthful supporters and pledged that their efforts
had not been wasted.</TE>
<TE>   "We lost a battle, but our goals remain the same," he said. "I say to
the young people who supported us . . . the situation is hard now, but
time is on your side."</TE>
<TE>   Laszlo Sebian-Petrovszki, 24, a political science student who voted
for the Socialists, said he saw very few policy differences between the
two sides.</TE>
<TE>   "But the way they use power is different," he said. "I support the
Socialists. They're not aggressive, and not maniacs for power."</TE>
<TE>   Sebian-Petrovszki also recalled being alienated by FiDeSz's rhetoric
during the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "They said we are the enemy--we are not another party, but the enemy.
It's a fact that the Hungarian Socialist Party has former Communist Party
members, and FiDeSz used that in its rhetoric against the Socialist
Party."</TE>
<TE>   But times have changed, he said: "That was a dictatorship. Now we have
democracy."</TE>

<HD>Upstart Chinese Lawyer Asks Court: For Whom the Bridge Tolls?</HD>
<DH>Asia: Lawsuit seeking 60 cents alleges that government illegally
collected fees. Case shows how citizen involvement in civic issues is
growing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY KUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>When Wesley Pan sued his local government for the equivalent of 60
cents, it was clearly not just for the money.</LD>
<LD>   The five yuan toll allows Pan to drive from his home in the Panyu
district over the Luoxi Bridge spanning a tributary of the Pearl River to
his job as a lawyer in the bustling city of Guangzhou. Most other bridges
into Guangzhou have paid off their loans and stopped collecting tolls
long ago, so he wondered why there was still a charge for the Luoxi. He
filed suit.</LD>
<LD>   "In the past, Chinese people were inured to arbitrary collection of
tolls. Now they're standing up to exercise their right of oversight over
the government," said Zhang Shuyi, a China University of Politics and Law
professor who later volunteered to represent Pan in court.</LD>
<TE>   Pan's legal battle to recoup his toll from the Luoxi Bridge in
southern China's Guangdong province is something new to the country's
evolving legal system: a public interest lawsuit. Based on a 1989 law
that allows citizens to take the government to court for illegal
administrative actions, the suit represents the stirrings of citizen
involvement in civic issues. The government has won about two-thirds of
such lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Guangdong was the first province in China to build bridges with
private investment and bank loans instead of government allocations. Pan
learned that the Luoxi Bridge was built in 1988 with an $8.5 million
donation from Panyu native and Hong Kong real estate magnate Henry Fok. A
vice chairman of China's legislature and one of Beijing's most trusted
advisors in Hong Kong, Fok has parlayed his connections into numerous
mainland business ventures. Fok has publicly criticized Panyu's failure
to mention his donation.</TE>
<TE>   The bridge authorities, it seemed to Pan, were taking advantage of
Fok's largess to reap illegal profits. The collection of fees over much
of the last 14 years, Pan argued, violated provincial laws, which
stipulate that road tolls can be collected only to pay off construction
loans.</TE>
<TE>   Last May, he sued the Panyu district government to force it to stop
collecting the tolls and give him his 60 cents back as a symbolic
gesture.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not trying to make things hard for the government," Pan, 31,
said in an interview. "We just want them to earn their revenues legally."</TE>
<TE>   Panyu district officials refused to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Pan's lawsuit cited a 1999 provincial government audit of the bridge
that made no mention of Fok's contribution but showed that the project
cost $18 million, which included some bank loans. The audit also showed
that since 1988, the bridge had raked in $111 million in tolls, many
times the amount that needed to be repaid.</TE>
<TE>   "The bridge must not become a cash cow!" declared a headline in
Guangzhou's Southern Metropolitan Daily, which, along with other local
media, reported on the case, defying a gag order from provincial
propaganda officials.</TE>
<TE>   Local residents complained about the tolls to the Guangdong provincial
legislature, which formally requested an explanation of the incident from
the Panyu district government.</TE>
<TE>   The government explained that it would take until 2008 to pay off the
bank loans on the bridge. It attributed confusion over Fok's donation to
incomplete government records.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the involvement of courts, the media, auditors and the local
legislature--institutions that are beginning to curb government
officials' power in China--have yet to prove decisive in the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   In January, an intermediate municipal court ruled that Pan had to have
an administrative hearing on his dispute before the lawsuit can be heard.
Pan appealed the ruling to a higher court, which heard both sides'
arguments last month and is now deliberating.</TE>
<TE>   The government "may try to throw up procedural obstacles, but that
will only draw the suit out," Pan said. "If I didn't think I could win, I
wouldn't have sued."</TE>

<HD>Philippine Explosion Kills 14, Hurts 45</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>MANILA
</DL>
<LD>Three explosions ripped through a major city in the southern
Philippines on Sunday, killing at least 14 people and injuring 45 others.</LD>
<LD>   Abu Muslin Ghazi, who identified himself as a regional commander of
the Muslim guerrilla group Abu Sayyaf, told Radio Mindanao Network today
that the rebels were responsible for the bombing outside a busy
department store in downtown General Santos.</LD>
<LD>   Ghazi blamed the U.S. military presence for the attack. "What happened
yesterday was only a warm up," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Within 40 minutes of the Gensan Fitmart department store blast, bombs
went off near a radio station and a bus terminal in the largely Christian
city on the island of Mindanao, a focal point of Muslim rebellion.</TE>
<TE>   Police said it was too early to accuse any specific group of carrying
out Sunday's bombings, blaming only "terrorists." Spokesmen for the Abu
Sayyaf said they had no knowledge of the group's involvement.</TE>
<TE>   But a Radio Mindanao Network office in nearby Koronadal said it
received a call an hour before the first blast from a man who earlier
called to complain about police boasts that the city was safe from
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The second bomb went off near a radio station, apparently causing no
injuries, and was followed several minutes later by the bus terminal
blast, which wounded several people, the city's disaster operations
center said.</TE>
<TE>   Bartolome Baluyot, police chief for central Mindanao, said two
unexploded bombs were discovered under a truck parked in front of the
department store. Most businesses closed, and checkpoints were set up on
major roads as part of a security clampdown amid fears of further
explosions.</TE>

<HD>A Tale of Broken Lives, Fractured Care</HD>
<DH>Siege: Israel's blockade has made it hard for medical supplies to
get in, leaving doctors at a loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Abdul Ghani Hussein, 62 and a manic depressive, has spent the last
year in the West Bank's only mental hospital. The British-built facility
is desperately short of medicine and food because of the Israeli siege
and, like the other 172 patients, Hussein for weeks has not been
receiving the medication he needs to maintain a shaky balance between
darkness and reality.</LD>
<LD>   His doctors can't say for sure that the lack of tranquilizer drugs was
to blame for what happened. But they do know that a suicidal Hussein rose
from his bed the other day after a lunch of rice and water, pried open a
window and jumped. His fall from the second floor onto a cement walkway
broke his left femur and caused internal bleeding.</LD>
<LD>   So Hussein lay on a gurney, mumbling incoherently, while a doctor
stroked his hand to comfort him, and Issam Bannourd, deputy director of
Bethlehem Psychiatric Hospital, was forced to call the Israeli military
and ask permission to ferry Hussein to a surgical hospital by ambulance.</LD>
<TE>   Without needed medicines, Bannourd says, what his hospital offers is
tantamount to anti-therapy, and as he contemplates the occupation of this
biblical city, he sees the line between sanity and insanity blurred.</TE>
<TE>   "All the patients have become more disturbed, more irritable, more
troublesome," he says. "They howl at night."</TE>
<TE>   There have been perhaps more dramatic scenes of Israel's crushing
attack on the West Bank than that of an old man in a frayed blue
sweatshirt sprawled on a cement slab, wanting death: families buried
alive in the rubble of their homes in Jenin; 35 bodies laid out in the
basement of a Nablus hospital, unclaimed because relatives did not dare
break a curfew; humanitarian aid convoys bearing food and medicine turned
back by Israeli soldiers at the entrance to Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   But the scene at the Bethlehem Psychiatric Hospital was a microcosm of
the shattered lives and facilities in the West Bank. Hussein, his doctors
and fellow patients--and many like them--were what the U.N. Security
Council was speaking of Friday when it expressed concern about the "dire
humanitarian situation" of Palestinian civilians and demanded that Israel
give medical and humanitarian aid agencies access to the occupied region.</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council voted 15-0 to send representatives to Jenin,
where the refugee camp was all but leveled in the offensive, "to clarify
facts." Israel, which denies conducting a massacre in Jenin and says its
campaign was directed solely against terrorists, has agreed to cooperate
with the mission.</TE>
<TE>   International humanitarian aid agencies have been among the most vocal
critics of Israel's policies in the West Bank. Their emergency
convoys--which have always included a foreign diplomat--have been denied
access to Palestinian areas or, more recently, allowed in only after
checkpoint delays that could last six or seven hours. Jewish settlers
passing the convoys on the road often have raised their middle fingers at
the aid workers and thrown bottles at the vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "Our work has been hindered over 18 months, not just the last three
weeks," said Nassim Nour, operations director for World Vision, a
U.S.-based international aid agency. "Because Israel basically doesn't
let Palestinians use the main roads, we've had to switch to
four-wheel-drive vehicles. That really increases our costs. We have to
literally go through fields to reach our projects, and that is very, very
dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ironic--when I was working in Africa during the Rwanda
massacre--how free I felt being able to cross borders easily because I
didn't have car plates identifying me as a Palestinian," Nour went on.
"Then I decide to come home to help my own people, and I find I am a
prisoner in Bethlehem."</TE>
<TE>   Israel has loosened its blockade in the last few days, but agencies
still have no assurance that they can get through checkpoints, and delays
can run into hours. The harassment has forced aid groups to rely on
foreign workers instead of Palestinians--another move that increases
costs--and to suspend long-term development projects in favor of
emergency work.</TE>
<TE>   "I honestly don't know why Israel takes this attitude," said Michael
Clark, chairman of the Assn. of International Developmental Agencies, an
umbrella group comprising 55 nongovernmental agencies. "It just doesn't
seem in Israel's best interest. The only logical reason I can think of is
that Israel doesn't want these people to receive water, food, medicine."</TE>
<TE>   Even Haaretz, Israel's most respected daily newspaper, commented that
the nation's blockade of aid has been a public relations disaster. After
a convoy of 30 trucks was held up trying to get to Ramallah and soldiers
fired tear gas at a coalition of leftist Jews and Arabs demonstrating at
the checkpoint in support of the shipment, the paper wrote:</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of making things hard, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]
spokesman should make an appearance with the trucks as a backdrop and say
to the world, via the world media, that this is the difference between us
and the Palestinians: They come to kill civilians; we come to help them.</TE>
<TE>   "But present-day Israel is apparently incapable of such gestures, even
if they pay a handsome PR dividend. The state and the army, contrary to
their official declarations, are unable to free themselves of the
conception that everyone on the other side is an enemy, and therefore
everyone who tries to help them is also an enemy."</TE>
<TE>   In Bethlehem, the IDF gave doctors at the psychiatric institution
permission to move the injured Hussein by ambulance to a hospital in Beit
Jala, the main one in the area. But that hospital did not have the plate
and screws necessary for the operation he needed. So Hussein would have
to wait.</TE>
<TE>   When Hussein arrived, the Beit Jala hospital's director, Dr. Peter
Qumri, was on the phone asking someone how best to dispose of "human
garbage." Qumri's doctors had placed placentas from a month of births in
plastic bags. They wrapped amputated limbs in sheets, but cats got into
the hospital at night and nibbled on them. Qumri received no satisfactory
answer.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you ever seen a crippled doctor?" asked Qumri, who with his
depleted staff has remained in the hospital since the Israeli assault
began March 29, fearful that if they left, they would not be able to
return. "Well, we are crippled--surgeons who cannot help people, who
cannot fulfill their professional obligations. What to do? Why to even
live?"</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO
</DL>
<LD>One recent morning, as the students at a private school in a
well-appointed suburb of this capital lined up for roll call, two of
their teachers stepped into the schoolyard and torched a drawing of the
Israeli flag--to the cheers of children and faculty alike.</LD>
<LD>   That was supposed to be a lesson in empowerment, a demonstration that
anger and frustration can be vented, that even schoolchildren can express
outrage. The students at the Modern Education School in Katameya Heights
also wrote letters to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and to
President Bush, like this one by 8-year-old Mohammed Amr Fadel:</LD>
<LD>   "Killing Palestinians will not do anything. Don't think that they
cannot feel like everyone feels. Please stop killing them. They're people
like us."</LD>
<TE>   Israel argues that it undertook its military operation in the West
Bank for self-protection, to root out terrorists. But the offensive has
not been seen that way here in one of the most moderate Arab countries,
the first to sign a peace treaty with the Jewish state and the first to
say that even in the current environment, there will be no war unless its
own territory is attacked.</TE>
<TE>   There are not two sides to the story in Egypt. There is only one: the
Palestinian side. From all walks of life, rich and poor, Muslim and
Christian, young and old, people here talk openly of their hatred for
Israel. Many say that they always hated the Jewish state, that they
accepted it only out of resignation, feeling there was little else they
could do. Their hate was packed up and stored away like a favorite
sweater that didn't fit anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Now it is out of the box, and if 18 months of Palestinian-Israeli
bloodletting did not let it out, the Israeli offensive in the West Bank
surely did.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody talks about it," said Ghada Shiwick, 36, a third-grade
English and science teacher at the school in Katameya Heights. "We had to
do something to let off steam, to teach them they can do something, they
don't have to sit and suffer."</TE>
<TE>   So the students wrote their letters. This one came from first-grader
Ahmed Maze: "Dear Mr. Sharon, If you don't stop killing, we will kill you
and if you kill Yasser Arafat, we will kill your army."</TE>
<TE>   Presidents and kings, prime ministers and emirs across the Arab region
have talked about the danger America faces if it does not find a way to
rein in Israel. Those with close ties to the United States have not
warned of a wider war, not immediately. Instead, they have spoken of a
drastic psychological shift, one more capable of undermining peace
efforts than any Scud missile shot by Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   It seems they were right. If there was a widespread, if grudging,
acceptance in the region that Israel could someday coexist peacefully
with all its Arab neighbors, that appears gone. If there was a feeling
that America was trying to be fair, that also seems to have disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   "I must stress," Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said recently, "that
the . . . policies of the Israeli government will not achieve the goal it
is seeking--security--but rather the opposite is true."</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak knows his people.</TE>
<TE>   Milad Hanna is a well-known member of the Coptic Christian community
in Cairo. He has served in parliament and at times acted as an ambassador
trying to help bridge the tense divide between Egypt's Muslim majority
and its Christian minority. Four years ago, he wrote a book called
"Acceptance of the Other." The idea was to promote harmony between all
peoples. That included Israelis and Egyptians, Muslims and Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Now he is refusing to allow his publisher to reprint the book.</TE>
<TE>   "My feeling is that theory is crap," Hanna said in an interview.
"Everyone is angry, including me. Israel is getting to be a fascist, Nazi
state. I am 77 years old, and I am willing to carry a gun, to die. My
feelings have changed. My dream was broken."</TE>
<TE>   Hanna says that Israel, with U.S. complicity, has radicalized the
masses and moved the average Arab to accept the concept of fighting
America and its Jewish allies, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, there is anger everywhere. Some say it is a reflection of the
difficult circumstances that exist in most Arab countries, where
unemployment is rampant, prospects for the future bleak and frustration
with the Arab community's inability to help the Palestinians palpable.
Others say it was born of the humiliation felt by the Arab world after
its defeat by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever its cause, television news footage keeps it alive, hour after
hour, on the Al Jazeera satellite network, with images of houses
flattened and of people maimed and killed.</TE>
<TE>   There have been demonstrations at college campuses around the region.
In Jordan, Queen Rania marched through Amman, the capital, in support of
the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   But this is just the public face of a far more subtle and far-reaching
phenomenon. Stop by the Trianon coffee shop in downtown Cairo and there
might be, as there was recently, a group of women who had gathered to
vent.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to explode if I don't do something," said Hend Hafez, a
homemaker from a wealthy family in the construction business. "We've been
talking about the Holocaust for so many years now, but no one talks about
the Palestinian dead. Is there a number that is set aside for genocide?"</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to say if the anger and hatred that are so tangible will
ever recede, if people will ever go back to at least the cold peace they
lived with before. Right now, first grade teacher Dina Makkawi, 29, just
can't imagine it.</TE>
<TE>   "The war does not belong to Palestine anymore," she said. "It's the
whole Middle East."</TE>

<LD>A fishing crew boarded an abandoned tanker to rescue a dog that had
been adrift on the vessel for 19 days, Humane Society officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Martha Armstrong, vice president of the Humane Society of the United
States, said crews were on board the Insiko 1907 and planned to return
the dog, named Forgea, to Honolulu.</LD>
<LD>   "They were trying to calm her down," she said. "She's been without
company for 19 days. . . . She's probably really excited."</LD>
<TE>   A Coast Guard plane dropped the crew's lunches to the tanker Saturday

<HD>Mother Accused in Teen Suicide Pact</HD>
<DH>Crime: A Michigan woman allegedly helped when her son and his wife,
both healthy, wanted to take their lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LANSING, Mich.
</DL>
<LD>They passed the law just across town from the Holey home, at the
state Capitol, to keep Dr. Jack Kevorkian from helping sick people kill
themselves. Now it's being invoked for just the second time, against a
mother accused of actively helping and even encouraging her healthy
teenage son and his healthy teenage wife to carry out a suicide pact.</LD>
<LD>   The very idea that the two kill themselves, police allege, came from
42-year-old Kathleen Holey.</LD>
<LD>   Her 19-year-old daughter-in-law survived the elaborately designed
death cocktail. Her son, also 19, did not.</LD>
<TE>   The former secretary now faces five years in prison in a case so
byzantine in its horrors that law enforcement veterans here are
struggling to wrap their minds around it. Arraigned last week, Kathleen
Holey is accused of going so far as to buy the teens anti-nausea
medication so they wouldn't vomit their overdose of narcotics.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing, from beginning to end, is bizarre," said Clinton
County prosecutor Chuck Sherman. "I've been here 20 years, so I've seen a
lot of awful cases, but this one, well, it certainly ranks at the top."</TE>
<TE>   For Patrick Allen Holey and Jennifer Patricia Holey, life was slipping
out of control by the evening of April 8, when the state took custody of
their 8-month-old daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick, who sang in the Everett High School choir, was known as the
thoughtful, caring person whom other members of his clique would turn to
for help with personal problems. Jennifer, who recently transferred from
another school, combed her hair over much of her face for her 2001
yearbook photograph.</TE>
<TE>   The two, whose group of friends tended toward heavy alternative rock
'n' roll and black T-shirts, married early last summer, had a baby girl
in August and returned to class in the fall. They soon dropped out,
however, school officials said, overwhelmed by the task of caring for
their new child.</TE>
<TE>   The state's Family Independence Agency took an interest in the couple
early on. They were young, they lived with Patrick's mother, who was
receiving disability for chronic pain, and no one in the household is
believed to have held a regular job.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, officials from the agency came to the house on the
working-class south side of Lansing and seized custody of their girl.</TE>
<TE>   The baby was "failing to thrive," a social worker had decided. She was
not gaining weight properly, seemed ill and, the case worker determined,
appeared to be in physical danger, said Clinton County Sheriff Wayne
Kangas.</TE>
<TE>   There was yet another trauma in the couple's nine-month marriage,
according to authorities. Both had been questioned by Lansing police in
connection with an investigation. Police declined to discuss the inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   On the morning after their daughter was taken, Kathleen Holey and the
young couple went to family court for the first in what was supposed to
become a series of hearings to determine their fitness as parents. The
judge ordered that, pending further proceedings, the child be kept in the
custody of the state. After leaving court, the three began discussing
suicide. Kathleen Holey suggested death may be the best solution to their
problems, according to statements made later by Jennifer Holey to police.</TE>
<TE>   In Kathleen Holey's red van, prosecutors allege that the three drove
home, gathered blankets and pillows and then headed to a pharmacy at
Michigan State University, nearby in East Lansing.</TE>
<TE>   Kathleen Holey filled a prescription in her name for the powerful
painkiller Fentanyl, in the form of lozenges, police say. She also filled
a prescription for a box of time-release Fentanyl patches, not unlike the
nicotine patches smokers apply to their skin to help them quit. And
finally, to help the teens keep the lozenges down, she bought the
anti-nausea medication.</TE>
<TE>   From there, the three headed to a last meal for the teens. They ate at
a McDonald's.</TE>
<TE>   Either shortly before or after the trip to McDonald's, Kathleen Holey
allegedly made another stop, dropping by a female friend's house. The
friend and the friend's 13-year-old daughter climbed into the van and off
the five went, discussing the fine points of the suicide plan as they
drove in search of a place to carry it out.</TE>
<TE>   There were issues to discuss: Kathleen Holey wanted to be certain she
could not be tied directly to their deaths, police contend, so they
headed northeast, to rural Clinton County. Jennifer told police later
that she wanted a proper burial, not to have her body decompose,
undiscovered, and so it was agreed that someone would make an anonymous
call to police two days later.</TE>
<TE>   As they talked about the plan, the teens took the anti-nausea
medication.</TE>
<TE>   About 20 miles from home, on a back road in Ovid Township, they came
across an abandoned farmhouse.</TE>
<TE>   The three Holeys broke a window and crawled through, into the
basement, authorities say, while Kathleen Holey's friend took the van for
a drive. They didn't want passersby noticing a vehicle parked there.</TE>
<TE>   In the basement, according to Jennifer Holey's account, the three
found a sheet of plywood. They placed it on the floor and covered it with
a blanket. Kathleen Holey arranged the pillows.</TE>
<TE>   She then divided the bottle of lozenges and watched as her son and
then his wife swallowed them with a can of soda, police say. Throughout,
they say, she was wearing rubber gloves to make certain she left no
fingerprints.</TE>
<TE>   She then removed the patches from their box, prosecutors allege, and
explained to the teens how to apply them. But she pointedly did not place
a patch on either of them, Jennifer Holey told police.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Holey did that on both of them after his mother had slipped
back through the window.</TE>
<TE>   After about 10 minutes, the red van reappeared. Kathleen Holey climbed
in, police say. Patrick and Jennifer Holey went to sleep.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, a dairy farmer and his family were on their way to Bible
class when they found Jennifer Holey, dirty, sobbing and incoherent,
standing on the side of the road. They thought she had been assaulted and
rushed her to Clinton County Memorial Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Police came and she began to tell her story.</TE>
<TE>   On April 10, sheriff's deputies found Patrick Holey's body, lying on
the makeshift bed.</TE>
<TE>   A neighbor later reported that also on April 10, before the deputies
arrived to find Patrick Holey's body, a red van had been parked at the
farmhouse. Sherman said he believes Kathleen Holey returned to clean up
the scene. No prescription bottles were found, he said, nor wrappers from
the narcotic patches.</TE>
<TE>   Public officials aren't discussing their theories about what motivated
the Holeys' actions, and those who knew the teens can't fathom why they
would do such a thing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just as perplexed and puzzled as anybody else," said Barbara
Yamanishi, a counselor at Everett High who knew both students. "They were
fine; they were very well-liked within their circle of friends. It's so
out there it isn't even in the realm of possibility."</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Holey died the week before Everett's annual Suicide Awareness
Week.</TE>
<TE>   Sherman, the prosecutor, spent days trying to determine if he could
charge Kathleen Holey with murder. But she didn't apply the patches. She
didn't place the lozenges in their mouths.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking to charge her with murder," Sherman said. "It came
awful close to that line, but I decided I didn't think she crossed it."</TE>
<TE>   By late Sunday, Kathleen Holey still had not given a statement to
detectives, police said, and her attorney did not return phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   Kevorkian, after winning three euthanasia trials against him, was
charged in 1999 under the law legislators wrote to stop him. He was
convicted, however, on a different charge, second-degree murder, after
giving a terminally ill man a lethal injection. He is serving a 10- to
25-year sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Kathleen Holey now stands to be the first person convicted under
Michigan's law against assisted suicide. Prosecutor Sherman is working
weekends to make sure she is.</TE>

<HD>Bush Faces a Fork in the Road on the Way to a Mideast Solution</HD>

<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No issue since Sept. 11 has opened sharper divisions in Washington
than President Bush's handling of the brutal conflict between Israel and
the Palestinians. Neoconservatives and Christian conservatives (joined by
some Democratic hawks) want Bush to pass the ammunition to Ariel Sharon
as the Israeli prime minister sends tanks rumbling through the West Bank.
But the internationalists in both parties want Bush to restrain Sharon
and push harder for a peace conference with the Arab states.</LD>
<LD>   This division roughly parallels the fault lines inside the
administration between the (internationalist) State Department and the
centers of conservative thinking in the Pentagon and Vice President Dick
Cheney's office. Bush often looks utterly ambivalent. His heart is
usually with the conservatives. But his head tugs him toward the
internationalists.</LD>
<LD>   If the administration is going to regroup after Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell's frustrating tour through the Middle East, it will need
more clarity. Bush is unlikely to set a sustainable course without
choosing sides on at least five questions dividing the conservatives from
the internationalists:</LD>
<TE>   Is Israel's war with the Palestinians the moral equivalent of
America's war against Al Qaeda? To the conservatives, Israel's struggle
is not only analogous to America's war against terrorism but an extension
of it. In their analysis, Israel is fighting the same forces of Islamic
extremism that would harm America. Thus, they think it's not only
hypocritical but also a threat to U.S. security for the administration to
demand Israeli restraint. "If suicide bombings prevail in the Middle
East," a group of social conservative leaders recently wrote Bush,
"surely America will see such attacks on our own families and
communities."</TE>
<TE>   While sympathetic to the parallels between American and Israeli
suffering, the internationalists believe the conservatives are stretching
the comparison too far. "That is the height of simplicity," says Sen.
Charles Hagel (R-Neb.).</TE>
<TE>   To the internationalists, the key difference is that the Palestinians,
however reprehensible their means, have legitimate aspirations toward
their own state. Accordingly, the internationalists believe that peace in
the region will come only through political negotiation; the
conservatives, without explicitly saying so, imply that Israel can impose
a victor's peace through unrestrained military action.</TE>
<TE>   Many around Bush believe his gut instinct is to see the Israeli
struggle against terrorism as largely equivalent to our own. Yet Bush
also appears to have accepted the internationalists' conclusion that the
conflict, at bottom, revolves around a political dispute over statehood
for which there is no purely military solution.</TE>
<TE>   Must peace in Israel precede war in Iraq? The internationalists
believe it would be like pouring gasoline on a house fire to attack Iraq
while Israel and the Palestinians are clawing at each other. "We cannot
press forward on a regime change in Iraq with the fires burning in
Israel, or we . . . will risk finding ourselves isolated, Israel
isolated," Hagel says.</TE>
<TE>   To the conservatives, that's exactly backward. They argue that peace
in Israel won't be possible until the United States removes Saddam
Hussein--and demonstrates to the Arab world its commitment to uprooting
terrorism. The theory is that such a show of resolve would convince "the
Palestinians that they had no choice but to talk to Israel," as a Wall
Street Journal editorial put it.</TE>
<TE>   All the effort the administration has devoted to reviving the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process suggests it fears the internationalists
are right. But intimates believe that Bush accepts enough of the
conservative logic that it isn't likely he'll wait forever for calm in
Israel before moving against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Can we negotiate with Yasser Arafat? The conservatives say Arafat is a
terrorist, and under the Bush doctrine, the United States should cut off
all contact with him. "Does President Bush still believe Yasser Arafat is
a man with whom we can do business?" William Kristol and Robert Kagan,
two leading neoconservatives, wrote recently. "The president will not
find a way out of the wilderness until he finally realizes the answer is
no."</TE>
<TE>   The internationalists say that, while Arafat may be odious, no peace
process is plausible today without him. Bush again seems torn between
head and heart. The passion in Bush's denunciations of Arafat probably
signals the president's deepest feelings. But Bush still allowed Powell
to meet with the Palestinian leader. Even so, it's clear that Bush wants
to reduce Arafat's influence by encouraging a greater role for other Arab
nations in peace talks.</TE>
<TE>   Is Saudi Arabia part of the solution or part of the problem? Since
Sept. 11, many conservatives have been spoiling for a fight with Saudi
Arabia. In a recent editorial, the conservative National Review lumped
together Saudi Arabia with Iraq and Iran as one of the three principal
sources of "the region's violence and instability."</TE>
<TE>   The internationalists believe Bush has to nurture the Saudi initiative
offering Arab recognition of Israel in return for the Jewish state
withdrawing to its pre-1967 borders. "We ought to at least try to boost
that," says Sen. Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, a dean of Republican
internationalists.</TE>
<TE>   On this one, the conservatives haven't gained much ground. Privately,
Bush may have strong words about Saudi toleration of extremism when he
hosts Crown Prince Abdullah at his Texas ranch this week. But publicly,
he's garlanded the Saudis with nothing but praise since Sept. 11, and
he's genuinely committed to advancing their peace initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Should American troops police a peace agreement? Republican
internationalists like Hagel and Lugar hint that any eventual agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians will require an international
peacekeeping force that includes U.S. troops. That prospect terrifies
conservatives, who think American soldiers would become a magnet for
suicide bombers. It's also likely to be a hard sell with Bush, who is so
resistant to deploying American peacekeepers that he doesn't even want to
send any to protect the government the United States fought to install in
Afghanistan. In any case, unless it can solve these other riddles, the
White House isn't likely to be worrying any time soon about how to manage
the peace in the Middle East.</TE>

<HD>Finance Summit Ends on a Mutual Note of Restraint</HD>
<DH>Meetings: Activists are unusually tame, while global monetary
leaders decline to offer immediate aid to poor countries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Global finance leaders concluded a weekend summit Sunday by
pressing wealthy nations to broaden their commitment to ending world
poverty, while anti-globalization activists wound down two days of
uncharacteristically orderly demonstrations.</LD>
<LD>   The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ended their spring
meetings by launching a campaign to send every child to primary school
and calling on the industrialized world to tear down trade barriers that
keep poor countries poor.</LD>
<LD>   But they declined to provide immediate financial relief for bankrupt
Argentina, and they left unresolved a standoff over a U.S. proposal to
replace Third World loans with grants.</LD>
<TE>   The nation's capital remained calm despite a proliferation of protest
causes and events. Some demonstrators marched on behalf of Palestinians,
some rallied to oppose U.S. policy in Colombia, and some assembled
outside IMF and World Bank headquarters to denounce the forces of
globalization.</TE>
<TE>   District of Columbia police reported no protest-related arrests
Sunday. The day before, when all 3,600 officers were placed on active
duty while tens of thousands of activists took part in a multi-themed
march, a few dozen demonstrators were apprehended.</TE>
<TE>   It was a far cry from the scene two years ago, when nearly 1,300
protesters were arrested here during the spring meetings of the World
Bank and the IMF. Similar gatherings in other cities around the world
have led to violent clashes between protesters and police.</TE>
<TE>   At the conclusion of Sunday's session, World Bank President James D.
Wolfensohn expressed gratitude that this year's anti-globalization
activists were smaller in number and less inclined to confrontation than
their predecessors. "That was a welcome relief to us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfensohn said he had met over the weekend with representatives of
organizations that oppose some World Bank policies, and he acknowledged
that their criticism has influenced bank policy. "I think that's not a
bad thing that there's an outside group that is constantly watching,
constantly pushing," he said. "They do have an effect."</TE>
<TE>   Inside the adjacent buildings that house the sister financial
institutions, participants in this year's sessions discussed emerging
evidence of a global economic recovery, debated their response to the
financial meltdown in Argentina and sought new strategies for stimulating
growth in the world's poorest countries.</TE>
<TE>   The World Bank's Development Committee announced an initiative
intended to ensure that all children be enrolled in primary school by
2015. An estimated 125 million children around the world currently
receive no schooling, bank officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The education campaign, which would require up to $5 billion in
outside financing, would begin with a "fast-track" demonstration program
in 10 poor countries.</TE>
<TE>   The policy-making panel called on the United States and other
industrial nations to reduce tariffs on agricultural products and other
exports from the developing world and to eliminate farm subsidies that
encourage overproduction and drive down world commodity prices.
Agricultural subsidies now exceed $300 billion a year, or roughly six
times the amount of development aid that rich countries provide to the
Third World.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not enough" to provide more financial aid to encourage
development in poor countries without addressing trade policies that have
the opposite effect, the committee said in its final communique.</TE>
<TE>   The global leaders left Washington without resolving an impasse over
the form future development assistance should take. U.S. Treasury
Secretary Paul H. O'Neill lobbied his counterparts to reduce the amount
of money provided to poor countries in the form of low-interest loans and
to increase the amount provided through grants, which do not have to be
repaid.</TE>
<TE>   But foreign leaders and World Bank officials have been leery of the
U.S. proposal, citing concerns that it could undermine aid programs by
reducing the stream of debt repayments used to finance additional
development. Until the matter is settled, no action can be taken on a
World Bank request for $12 billion in immediate funding to replenish the
development account.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not being resolved here," British development minister Clare
Short acknowledged at the conclusion of Sunday's meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, cold rain thinned the number of people attending Sunday's
protest events.</TE>
<TE>   At a festival held near the Washington Monument to protest U.S. policy
in Colombia, activists took cover under trees or umbrellas as speakers
urged them to help shut down a facility at Ft. Benning, Ga., where Latin
American military personnel have received training from their U.S.
counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   Nate Clark said he and his wife traveled from Cleveland by bus with a
group of peace activists because they believed it was important for their
8-year-old son to see the movement at work.</TE>
<TE>   Clark and his wife, Mui, came primarily to protest the military
response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, but they said they also
supported many of the weekend's other causes.</TE>
<TE>   "We think we can all work together to end oppression," he said,
"whether it's from the military here or governments elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, black-clad anarchists wearing bandannas to partially cover
their faces gathered in a circle for games. In the center, a young woman
with fuchsia hair used a bullhorn to summon "anyone with multiple face
piercings!" On hands and knees, several giggling game contestants who fit
that description scampered through the mud on hands and knees to be the
first to tag her.</TE>
<TE>   From the stage, organizers urged the crowd to attend anti-violence
training to prepare for civil disobedience planned for today.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers said they intended to conduct a march, without a police
permit, and block morning rush-hour traffic on Capitol Hill. Later in the
day, pro-Palestinian activists plan to carry out "creative actions" near
the Washington Hilton, where the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee
is holding its annual conference. Streets near the hotel have been shut
down by Washington police, and AIPAC organizers have changed the location
of some events, citing security concerns.</TE>

<HD>Earth Day Shadows for Bush</HD>
<DH>Politics: Led by Gore, environmentalists are attacking president's
policies on eve of celebration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>As President Bush leads the nation today in celebrating Earth Day's
32nd anniversary, environmentalists are unleashing a harsh and
coordinated attack headed by former Vice President Al Gore on his energy
and environmental policies.</LD>
<LD>   The erstwhile White House rivals have scheduled dueling public
appearances to mark the day--Bush in New York's Adirondack Mountains and
Gore at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.</LD>
<LD>   But more than a replay of the last presidential campaign, today's
developments could serve as a harbinger of the next one, regardless of
whether Gore runs again.</LD>
<TE>   And while today's rhetoric will focus on the environment, the
political back-and-forth also seems to illustrate the growing willingness
of Democrats and other detractors to attack a war commander's handling of
an array of issues, including the Middle East and the war in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Almost every action Bush has taken on the environment has drawn
scathing attacks, from the now-stalled proposal to explore for gas and
oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to the secretive manner in
which Vice President Dick Cheney developed a national energy policy.</TE>
<TE>   And with many senior posts in key agencies, such as the Interior
Department, occupied by onetime industry executives, ties between the
Bush administration and big business have also emerged as a point of
contention. Recently released Energy Department records reveal, for
instance, that industry executives enjoyed far greater access to senior
government officials drafting the energy plan than environmental groups
did.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Gore nor the environmental groups is holding fire.</TE>
<TE>   For example, rather than waiting until after Bush's remarks today to
issue their reactions--the time-honored Washington tradition--they acted
preemptively.</TE>
<TE>   By Friday afternoon, numerous groups had delivered condemnations of
the president's policies--pegged to his New York speech today. The
Natural Resources Defense Council, which has played a central role in
publicizing the inner workings of Cheney's energy task force, ran a
Sunday newspaper ad with this headline: "On Earth Day, President Bush
will probably plant a tree. . . . It's the other 364 days we're worried
about."</TE>
<TE>   After much criticism about the development of its national energy
policy, the Bush administration has stepped up its emphasis on
conservation.</TE>
<TE>   At Saranac Lake in upstate New York this morning, Bush will discuss
the nation's progress on the environment, but he intends to tout his
"Clean Skies" initiative, which he said last week would "improve air
quality by dramatically cutting power emissions from power plants."</TE>
<TE>   The president characterized his initiative as the best option for
reducing pollution from aging, coal-fired power plants. It would set a
nationwide cap on sulfur dioxide emissions but allow older, dirtier
plants to buy "credits" from newer, cleaner plants.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups say the cap is too high and have denounced the
initiative as nothing more than a "smoke screen" for what they called a
"polluter-friendly" plan.</TE>
<TE>   In Nashville, Gore is scheduled to deliver a critique of Bush's
policies on the environment--an issue with which the former vice
president is closely identified. He is the author of "Earth in the
Balance," a 1992 best-selling book on environmental issues.</TE>
<TE>   Previewing his speech in an opinion article in the New York Times on
Sunday, Gore contended Bush's policies "are completely dominated by a
group of current and former oil and chemical company executives"
determined to resist efforts to clean up the environment.</TE>
<TE>   The former vice president and onetime senator from Tennessee has not
revealed whether he will again seek the Democratic presidential
nomination. But his increasing outspokenness--he delivered an address at
the state Democratic convention in Florida last weekend--is fueling
speculation he wants a rematch against Bush in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   In the op-ed article, Gore called for "real, forward-thinking
leadership and a renewed focus on the environment" and asserted that
Bush's "Clean Skies" initiative "actually increases air pollution levels
by allowing more toxic mercury, nitrogen oxide and sulfur emissions than
does current law."</TE>
<TE>   Gore concluded: "Put simply, this administration has consistently sold
out America's future in return for short-term political gains."</TE>

<HD>Energy Dept.'s Nuclear Security Fears Told</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Amid public assurances, an official warned that
facilities need more funding to thwart possible attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Department of Energy in late March warned the White House in
writing that its facilities, which include sites containing nuclear
materials, remain vulnerable to terrorist attack because of the
administration's refusal to fund critical security needs.</LD>
<LD>   The letter, dated March 28, was released Sunday by Rep. Edward J.
Markey (D-Mass.), who has been a frequent and vocal critic of the current
levels of security at the nation's nuclear sites.</LD>
<LD>   Concerns about safeguarding nuclear facilities have been high since
intelligence reports indicated that Al Qaeda operatives, interested in
exploiting U.S. security weaknesses, consider such sites desirable
targets for attack or infiltration.</LD>
<TE>   The private correspondence, from the Energy Department's chief
financial officer to a top official at the White House Office of
Management and Budget, marks the first indication of alarm about security
at such facilities by Bush administration officials, who have repeatedly
offered public assurances that security is sufficient to meet heightened
demands.</TE>
<TE>   "The Department's remaining safeguards and security budgets are not
sufficient to implement security posture requirements that appropriately
respond to the September 11th attacks," said the Energy Department's
Bruce M. Carnes, who cautioned that his agency was at a "crucial
juncture."</TE>
<TE>   In the letter addressed to Marcus Peacock, a senior OMB official,
Carnes said he was "disconcerted" by the OMB's decision not to provide
additional funds. He was told, he added, that the OMB decided not to
support the request because a revised threat analysis required of the
Energy Department had not been completed.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't a tenable position for you to take, in my view," Carnes
said. "We are not operating, and cannot operate under the pre-September
11 Design Basis Threat . . . and you have not provided us the resources
to do so."</TE>
<TE>   Carnes, who did not specify how much additional money was being
sought, also expressed dismay that he was not given the chance to argue
the department's position personally.</TE>
<TE>   Congress approved $111 million in supplemental funding for security at
nuclear weapon laboratories after the terrorist attacks, and the White
House is seeking nearly $700 million more for lab security in the 2003
budget.</TE>
<TE>   Markey on Sunday requested President Bush's "immediate assistance" in
ensuring the protection of the nation's nuclear facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The congressman told Bush in a letter dated today that his concerns
lie not only in the potential of nuclear materials to be stolen, but also
in the likelihood that nuclear sites could be targeted for attack.</TE>
<TE>   "I am stunned by the apparent failure of the White House to provide
sufficient resources to adequately protect this country's nuclear weapons
facilities from terrorist attack," Markey said. Markey emphasized that 10
Energy Department sites--including facilities near urban locations such
as California's Bay Area and Denver--reportedly contain sufficient
amounts of weapon-grade plutonium and uranium to make a crude atomic
bomb.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration has requested almost $8 billion for missile
defense, which won't do anything to prevent suicidal terrorists from
attacking nuclear facilities and blowing up dirty bombs or homemade
nuclear weapons," Markey said Sunday. "But when DOE finally admits
security is not what it should be, OMB refuses to help."</TE>

<HD>Newport Film Festival Closes With Slight Gain in Attendance</HD>

year.</DH>

<LD>The Newport Beach Film Festival took a risk on rapid growth in its
third year, and organizers say it succeeded, although not as resoundingly
as they had hoped.</LD>
<LD>   The nine-day event, which ended with an awards ceremony Friday,
offered 73 features and 16 programs of short films--up from 56 features
and 14 bills of shorts a year ago. The festival branched out from two
screens to three, adding the Lido Theater on Balboa Peninsula to the two
screens at Fashion Island's Edwards Island Cinemas that had been used in
the past. The festival also offered two days of free seminars at the
Newport Beach Public Library, featuring screenwriters, directors,
composers, designers and technical experts.</LD>
<LD>   The result was an increase in attendance from 17,000 to about
19,500--although that fell short of the goal of 20,000 or more that
organizers had set.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not as much as I'd hoped, but for our third year, we're
pleased," Gregg M. Schwenk, the festival's executive director, said
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Schwenk said he did not have complete figures from box-office returns,
but "We're hopeful we'll walk away with a small profit that can be the
seed for next year's film festival." Schwenk said the attendance figure
includes guests who were showing their films as well as ticket-buying
film buffs.</TE>
<TE>   Schwenk said the festival raised about $125,000 in cash this year;
factoring in donated goods and services, including the value of the time
put in by scores of volunteers, he put the festival's cost at $800,000,
up from $500,000 a year ago. At this point, the festival can afford to
pay only a modest stipend to key workers; it has no salaried employees.
The city of Newport Beach, which has nurtured the festival as a magnet
for tourism, was the leading cash donor with. a $75,000 contribution.</TE>
<TE>Some Fests Downsize in Wake of 9/11, Recession</TE>
<TE>   Schwenk said that some other West Coast festivals, including ones in
Santa Barbara and Seattle, had downsized this year because of the
recession and the fallout from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Being able to expand under those circumstances was "a testament to the
strength of this festival and [Newport Beach] being an important regional
market," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For local film buffs, the festival brought in dozens of independent
features and documentaries that otherwise would not have been screened in
Orange County. Nevertheless, most of this year's award-winning titles
sported name actors rather than unknowns.</TE>
<TE>   "Each year, the depth and quality and sophistication increase in the
world of independent film," Schwenk said.</TE>
<TE>   "With that, you see name talent willing to be associated with those
filmmakers, [The jurors' choices] are a reflection of where independent
film is going."</TE>
<TE>   Three films--one each from Italy, Australia and the Netherlands-took
the six top awards for non-documentary features.</TE>
<TE>   "Ti Voglio Bene, Eugenio (Eugenio, I Love You)" was named best film,
and its star, Giancarlo Giannini, received the best actor award for his
portrayal of a good-hearted janitor in a rest home for accident victims.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Connolly won the best director and best screenplay awards for
his film, "The Bank."</TE>
<TE>   The Australian thriller features Anthony LaPaglia as an unscrupulous
financier. "Nynke," a Dutch film about the relationship troubles of a
children's book author, won for best cinematography, and Monique
'Hendrickx was named best actress in the title role.</TE>
<TE>   The best documentary was "Dogtown and Z-Boys."</TE>
<TE>   Narrated by Sean Penn, it traces how a group of ragtag 1970s
skateboarders who practiced in empty swimming pools originated the
high-flying daredevil style that is now a hallmark of the extreme sports
industry.</TE>
<TE>   An Irish film, "On the Nose," won the Audience Award for best feature.
It stars Robbie Coltrane as a problem gambler who works as a janitor at a
Dublin medical college--then finds a secret method for winning at the
racetrack. Dan Aykroyd plays a supporting role.</TE>
<TE>   Four other full-length films that lost out in the jurors' and
audiences' selections received Awards of Merit from the festival's
organizers: the German film, "As Far as My Feet Will Carry Me"; "When the
Rain Lifts," from Japan; "In the Bosom of the Enemy," from the
Philippines; and "Crash Boats," a U.S. documentary about the crewmen who
manned small boats during World War II and the Korean War.</TE>
