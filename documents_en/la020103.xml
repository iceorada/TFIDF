<DL></DL>
<LD>Heating up the competitive prime-time news channel battle, legal
analyst Greta Van Susteren, one of CNN's most recognizable names and
the anchor of its prime-time show, "The Point," is jumping to rival
Fox News Channel.</LD>
<LD>   Sometime in the next three months, Van Susteren will anchor a live
weeknight show, replacing a program that until three months ago was
anchored by Paula Zahn, who in September left Fox for CNN.</LD>
<LD>   Van Susteren's contract is up soon, and CNN sources said the
network made her a counter-offer to stay on, with CNN News Group
Chairman Walter Isaacson one of her biggest supporters. Kate Snow
will step in for the moment as anchor of "The Point," which has been
CNN's second-highest rated prime-time program. Van Susteren had also
co-anchored CNN's daytime "Burden of Proof" before that show was
canceled in December.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, CNN said it has hired Fredricka Whitfield, an
Atlanta-based NBC News correspondent, as a weekend anchor.</TE>

<LD>   What's in a Name? Plenty, According to FX</LD>
<LD>   FX has renamed its first original drama series, originally called
"Rampart." The show, due to premiere in March, is now titled "The
Shield."</LD>
<TE>   The series presents the police in what the network terms a "tough,
morally ambiguous world" where the line between good and evil is
blurred.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Ryan ("Nash Bridges"), who created the pilot, is executive
producer, along with Scott Brazil ("Hill Street Blues").</TE>
<TE>   The original title of the hourlong series didn't sit well with the
Los Angeles Police Department when it was announced in late August.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. John Pasquariello, an LAPD spokesman, said shows such as
these "capitalize on sensational headlines" and "negatively influence
youth."</TE>
<TE>   Though FX spokesman John Solberg declined to say whether police
response factored into the name change, LAPD pressure may have played
a part.</TE>
<TE>   According to an insider, after department officials saw the pilot,
they demanded that all references to the city--including badges and
police cars--be covered since LAPD approval had not been obtained.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Solberg chalked the move up to research gathered from
screenings and focus sessions.</TE>
<TE>   "We found that people who were aware of the Rampart allegations
thought the show was straight out of the newspaper--despite the fact
we've always maintained that it's, in no way, a docudrama," he said.
"And because no one outside of Los Angeles was familiar with Rampart,
the title didn't make sense. The series is very important to us, so
we opted for a more accurate and descriptive title."</TE>
<TE>   The show will be shot in Los Angeles, but is set in a fictitious
locale, he said.</TE>
<TE>   FX has ordered 13 episodes of the series.</TE>

<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   'Lion King' Reduces Seats to Prolong Run</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to extend the run of "The Lion King" at the Pantages
Theatre, Disney Theatrical has partitioned off the rear mezzanine,
reducing capacity from 2,704 to 2,261.</TE>
<TE>   Though the production sold out through most of December, tickets
sales averaged only 2,400 to 2,500 seats per performance in recent
months. Reducing capacity will help ensure sellouts and stimulate
demand for later performances, said spokeswoman Leticia Buckley.</TE>
<TE>   Although the production is now selling tickets only through the
end of March, "our plan is to be around for at least another year,"
she added.</TE>
<TE>   Even at its lower capacity, the Pantages will remain the largest
theater in which "The Lion King" is playing.</TE>

<TE>   Giuliani Takes a Bow</TE>
<TE>   at Lincoln Center</TE>
<TE>   In one of his last acts as mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani
paid a final official visit to Lincoln Center.</TE>
<TE>   "When you bought your tickets, you didn't know I was going to sing
tonight," Giuliani quipped to a packed house gathered to hear the New
York Philharmonic's traditional New Year's Eve performance of
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony--a "life-embracing" piece that he said was
particularly appropriate for a city recovering from the Sept. 11
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani also got off another one-liner after noting that Sir John
Eliot Gardiner would be standing in for the usual conductor, Kurt
Masur, who is recovering from kidney surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "We're both 'Sirs,'" said Giuliani, who was recently so-honored by
Queen Elizabeth II. "He's a sir from England, and I'm a sir from
Brooklyn."</TE>

<HD>A Platform for Paranoia</HD>
<DH>Comedian Kevin Nealon is hosting 'The Conspiracy Zone' on
TNN.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As host of the National Network's new series "The Conspiracy Zone
With Kevin Nealon," the actor-comedian has become a bit paranoid. "I
wasn't much concerned about conspiracies before this show, but since
doing 15 episodes, my paranoia has been piqued and tweaked a little
bit."</LD>
<LD>   Not only is the former "Saturday Night Live" regular looking
behind his back, "I am looking behind my knees and every part of my
body now and just scratching my head," he deadpans. "I have heard all
kinds of theories from the Earth being hollow to Big Brother is
watching us to alien abductions with a podiatrist taking metallic
fragments out of people's feet who have been abducted and it's a
substance unlike any found on Earth."</LD>
<LD>   "The Conspiracy Zone," which premieres Sunday on the cable channel
(formerly known as the Nashville Network), is a light-hearted but
"open-eyed" look into the world of the unexplained. Each episode
features expert panelists, plus a celebrity guest who can either be a
proponent or skeptic of a conspiracy theory. In addition to staples
like alien abductions and Big Brother, topics will also include the
deaths of Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe, Princess Diana and the
Kennedy assassination. Celebrity guests include Coolio, Adam Carolla,
Harry Shearer, Skip E. Lowe, Gabe Kaplan and Linda Blair.</LD>
<TE>   The 30-minute weekly series is the brainchild of executive
producer Scott Carter, who produced more than 1,000 episodes of Bill
Maher's "Politically Incorrect."</TE>
<TE>   Carter says it's been interesting encountering the community of
people who believe in conspiracy theories.</TE>
<TE>   "They are divided into two groups," he says. "There are the
experiencers and the researchers. There also tend to be people who
either divide themselves into the paranormal realm, which can be
alien abduction, or the people who tend to be more on the political
side with assassination theories."</TE>
<TE>   And occasionally, the paranormal and the political twain do meet.
"There are those who believe Marilyn Monroe was assassinated because
Kennedy had revealed to her the secrets of Roswell and Area 51," says
Carter. "And she was going to be blab them and therefore she had to
be silenced. That is the crossroads of the two theories."</TE>
<TE>   Nealon discovered during the taping of the first 15 episodes that
the members of the conspiracy community firmly believe in their
respective theories. "They are very well-educated and aware of all
the events," says Nealon. "They are well-versed in what they believe
in. But as with any conspiracy, it's hard to disprove or prove it."</TE>
<TE>   Though Nealon is able to have fun with his guests, he is careful
not to make fun of them. "You don't want to use the word 'crazy,'"
Nealon says. "You have to walk a fine line."</TE>
<TE>   "We told the people in the conspiracy community that we will give
you a forum for your ideas but we won't give you a blank check," says
Carter. "You have to defend your ideas. And the viewpoint of Kevin as
a host is that he is not coming to this from a tremendous expertise.
He is open to being convinced."</TE>
<TE>   Though the panelists format is akin to "Politically Incorrect,"
Carter says that Nealon is a vastly different host from Maher. "Bill
comes to it with a very strong point of view and wants to take on the
panelists himself," says Carter. "Kevin comes on with a position of
curiosity. He wants to find out what all the panelists have to say if
anything, and get them to talk to each other."</TE>
<TE>   Carter and his staff cast a wide net for mainstream conspiracies
such as the Kennedy assassination, to the more bizarre ones, like an
alleged time-travel experiment by the government in World War II.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most bizarre installments finds theorists proclaiming
that the center of the Earth is inhabited by reptiles. And there is
the inner-Earth-sun theory. "Some people believe there is a sun in
the center of the Earth and the northern lights are from the sun in
the center of the Earth coming through the hole at the North Pole,"
says Carter.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a whole community of theorists who maintain the last
battle of World War II took place at the South Pole in 1947, two
years after the official end to the global conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a battle between the last remnants of the Third Reich and
10,000 U.S. Navy sailors under the direction of Adm. Byrd," says
Carter of the theory.</TE>
<TE>   The conspiracy community has thrived and is growing because of the
Internet, Carter believes: "There is kind of a phenomena occurring
here, and I think we are going to be able to tap into it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Conspiracy Zone With Kevin Nealon" can be seen Sundays at 9
p.m. on TNN. The network has rated it TV-PG.</TE>

<LD>* New This Week: Japanese magnum auteur Takeshi "Beat" Kitano brings
both his twitchy, roughneck persona and his penchant for extravagant
brutality to "Brother," a riveting if erratic thriller in which he
plays a yakuza soldier forced to flee to Los Angeles, where he builds
his own multicultural crime empire. From this film--a sleek,
disorderly hybrid of Japanese warrior saga and American gangsta
melodrama--you could get the idea that slicing off your own fingers
would win you sympathy and whatever else you might be after.</LD>

<LD>Re "The Iraqi Military's Achilles' Heel Is Saddam Hussein,"
Commentary, Dec. 26: Thank you for [retired Marine] Lt. Col. James
Zumwalt's evaluation, as background, of Saddam Hussein as a military
commander in chief should the U.S. decide to move the focus of the
war on terrorism to Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   While the Iraqi military--and civilians, too--may be more
galvanized to defend their own homeland, whereas in the case of
Kuwait they were not, it is the substance of Zumwalt's message that
Iraq still does not have the culture and motivation to muster an
effective resistance to a U.S. onslaught such as was visited upon
Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Zumwalt is almost incontrovertibly right: We can and should ensure
that the tyrant does not survive. Yet Hussein survives and, so far,
Bin Laden does also.</LD>
<TE>   The unfortunate problem, however, is that we will not likely
develop the political will and independence of thought to act for
fear of offending the nondemocratic self-interest of many Islamic and
oil-rich nations in the region, or the many highly developed but
oil-dependent nations that fear the temporary economic dislocation
that will occur if they openly associate with and encourage a
realignment of the world order, i.e., the forceful elimination of
terrorism as a global instrument of diplomacy.</TE>

<LD>I had a friend named Leonard who used to say, when adversity
threatened, "I feel something crawling up my leg."</LD>
<LD>   He would get a wary look in his eyes, hunch down and head in that
bent-over position for the backyard, looking a little like a
panic-stricken Groucho Marx.</LD>
<LD>   What he was doing in the backyard was digging a bomb shelter. It
was during the Cold War, and he, along with many others, was
preparing for an impending apocalypse.</LD>
<TE>   When we kidded him about it, he would laugh grimly and say we
would all be turned into French fries in a nuclear holocaust while
he, like the gopher and the prairie dog, would emerge from his hole
unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   But that just wasn't to be. They found poor Leonard one day at the
bottom of the trench he had dug to a depth of about 5 feet, dead of a
heart attack. I guess you could say that the laugh was rather on him.</TE>
<TE>   I mention this today by way of welcoming you to the year 2002 and
pointing out that bomb shelters are once more in vogue.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating a new market, manufacturers have taken to the
Internet to warn us that Armageddon is in the air and that we had
better start thinking about ways to protect ourselves, our family,
our DVD players and whatever else of value we can cram into a small
underground space. Saving the cat is optional.</TE>
<TE>   The reason for all the preparation, shelter hucksters say, is
obvious. India and Pakistan are bumping bellies over Kashmir, the
Palestinians and Israel have firmly established violence as a
Mideastern tradition, Syria is sneaking in nuclear triggers,
terrorists are planning bad things for everyone and God knows what's
going on in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   To paraphrase the musical satirist Tom Lehrer, this has made us
all as nervous as a Christian Scientist with appendicitis.</TE>
<TE>   Those who remember the Cold War will recall a similar doomsday
feeling that occupied our thoughts in the 1950s. Schoolchildren were
told to duck and cover, plans for the mass evacuations of large
cities were formulated, and 40% of all Americans were thinking about
building fallout shelters.</TE>
<TE>   A shelter could cost up to $5,000 when equipped with toilets,
telephones, air filters and enough food and water to last for two
weeks. Wall Street investors speculated at the time that the shelter
business could gross up to $20 billion and, salivating more fiercely
than Pavlov's dog, joined in the shrill warning that the end of the
world was near.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics scoffed that shelters would serve only to turn their
occupants into tandoori chicken because of the intense heat of an
atomic blast. But cities continued to talk about building shelters
that could hold up to 50 million people, and farmers wondered how
they could build them large enough to hold their cows.</TE>
<TE>   I am among those who recall the Cold War with a certain amount of
grim nostalgia. I didn't build a bomb shelter then, and I don't plan
on building one now, but I am taken with a strong feeling of deja vu
as I surf the Internet's material on life underground in the event
that things get, well, out of hand.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, one Web site offers information relative to meters
capable of detecting everything from nuclear radiation to an outbreak
of German measles, while another yields updates on potassium iodide
anti-radiation pills. A third outlines how to send for nuclear target
maps, a kind of guide, I suppose, on where not to live when the
missiles start flying.</TE>
<TE>   Ifeel relatively confident that evacuation just won't work in L.A.
as an alternative to annihilation. We can't get through the evening
rush hour on our freeways with any kind of efficiency, so it's
unlikely that we'll all be able to get out of town easily, if at all.
Three fender-benders and a mattress in the fast lane and we're
doomed. I suspect that terrorists are storing up old mattresses even
now, waiting for the right moment to dump them onto the Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   I also don't feel that bomb shelters are the answer, despite
illustrations on the Internet revealing how the simplest of us can
create an adequate, if primitive, means of surviving a nuclear
attack.</TE>
<TE>   I am especially taken by a photograph of "two non-athletic college
girls" with radiant smiles, hunkered down in what the caption
describes as a "four-person Pole-Covered Trench Shelter." It took
them 351/2 hours to build it using only hand tools, but, silly girls,
they could have done it in far less time if they hadn't dug it near a
tree.</TE>
<TE>   An accompanying text points out that the digging took place in
Utah in the summer, so the "coeds," as we used to call them, decided
to build it in the shade. Not only did they encounter roots that were
tough for them to cut through, but, the text adds, "gamma rays from
fallout particles on the leaves and branches would reach and
penetrate the shelter." Best, I suppose, to avoid trees and possibly
even Utah in the summer.</TE>
<TE>   There is much to learn from those who, anticipating our needs, are
busy warning us what we might face if we don't start digging. Flash
burns, fires, blindness, skin burns from heated dust ("the popcorn
effect") and probably dry mouth and unpleasant sexual side effects
are just a few of the maladies that await at the height of a nuclear
encounter.</TE>
<TE>   Well, I don't know about you, but I'm going on vacation before
whatever is crawling up my leg reaches its target. If hell awaits,
I'd rather it be on company time and not when I am out enjoying
myself on a beach somewhere. So see you later and happy new year, if
we're still around.</TE>

<LD>Sean Penn isn't swinging at paparazzi anymore. Instead, he's keeping
his distance from Hollywood, living in Marin County with his wife,
Robin Wright Penn, and two kids, and launching angry salvos at the
media through the media.</LD>
<LD>   In the February issue of Talk magazine, the famously fiery actor
likened Bill O'Reilly, host of Fox News Network's talk show "The
O'Reilly Factor," to such villains as Adolf Hitler, Joe McCarthy and
Osama bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a long history of people who capitalize on the lowest
common denominator of people's impulses," Penn said. "These guys ...
die like everyone else. And when they do, their legacy is one of
damaging the spirit of good things, and they become rather broken,
pathetic figures. And it is going to happen to [O'Reilly]."</LD>
<TE>   Late last year, O'Reilly drew ire from Hollywood for criticizing
the belated distribution of the estimated $250 million raised to help
victims of the terrorist attacks by the Sept. 21 celebrity telethon
"America: A Tribute to Heroes." O'Reilly ridiculed several
participants, including Sylvester Stallone, Mike Myers and George
Clooney for refusing to comment on reports that the funds hadn't been
directed in a timely fashion to the victims' families.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to trade O'Reilly for Bin Laden, and then we can decide
[who is worse] when he gets here," Penn said. O'Reilly is "an
embraced pariah, that's what he is. ... He's a grumpy, self-loathing
joke."</TE>
<TE>   A Fox spokeswoman told us that O'Reilly planned to address Penn's
comment on his Wednesday night show as "the most ridiculous item of
the day."</TE>
<TE>   Double Duty</TE>
<TE>   The battle between Dick Clark and Michael Greene, and their music
award shows, escalated this week as Clark told television viewers
during his New Year's special that "Michael Jackson is a man of his
word," and that the pop star would appear on Clark's American Music
Awards show, which is scheduled to air Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael will be on the show. It's confirmed," said Clark's
spokesman, Paul Shefrin. When asked if Clark had spoken to Jackson's
manager, Shefrin said: "Dick may have spoken with Michael directly
... he didn't make that up."</TE>
<TE>   Greene's office did not comment, but a Jackson management
spokesman said the star would do both shows. He will accept an
"Artist of the Century" award during the AMA show and will perform on
the Feb. 27 Grammy show at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Citizen Rudy</TE>
<TE>   At the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve, Rudy Giuliani didn't
turn into a pumpkin. Rather, the mayor of New York and Time's Man of
the Year became a private citizen. Seconds later, he was kissing his
paramour, Judith Nathan, live on national television in Times Square.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani's personal life received much scrutiny during his tenure
as mayor, particularly as the warfare with his estranged wife, Donna
Hanover, escalated. At one point, Hanover got a court order barring
Nathan from visiting the mayor's official residence, Gracie Mansion.</TE>
<TE>   Acquitting Himself</TE>
<TE>   It may have been a difficult year for Sean "P. Diddy" Combs, but
that didn't prevent the rap mogul from throwing an extravagant New
Year's party for nearly 1,000 guests at the Shore Club hotel in Miami
Beach. The bash, an homage to Truman Capote's famous 1966 Black and
White Ball, featured fire eaters, mermaids and a $60,000 checkered,
plexiglass dance floor over the pool. But, unlike Capote's party,
thrown in honor of Katharine Graham, the party was short on media
moguls. Instead, revelers included Lenny Kravitz, Billy Corgan and
members of N'Sync.</TE>
<TE>   The multimillionaire rapper and entrepreneur had cause to
celebrate. Last year he was acquitted of weapon possession and
attempted bribery charges in a case stemming from a 1999 shooting at
a crowded Manhattan dance club.</TE>
<TE>   Combs, the artist formerly known as Puff Daddy, is due to be in
L.A. next week to host Clark's AMA award show.</TE>

<LD>By Joyce Carol Oates</LD>
<LD>   Carroll &amp; Graf</LD>
<LD>   138 Pages, $15.95</LD>
<TE>   Joyce Carol Oates often takes on sensational subject matter in her
fiction, yet rarely has she done so with the churningly quiet
understatement of her new novel, "Beasts." A junior at Catamount
College in southwest Massachusetts during the 1970s, Gillian Brauer
feels as passionately about her charismatic poetry professor, Andre
Harrow, as she does about her own writing. But Gillian isn't the only
young female student to fall for Andre's charms, and she soon finds
that the professor and his sculptress wife, Dorcas, have left behind
a trail of favorite female students. Oates does an especially fine
job of revealing the entwined boldness and vulnerability of young
women on their own for the first time, and in Gillian she reflects
these qualities in equal measure.</TE>
<TE>   Curious about her professor's personal life, Gillian visits
Dorcas' sculpture exhibit, "Totem and Taboo," in the college art
museum, finding herself both drawn to and disturbed by what she sees:
"Her sculptures! They were made of wood, larger than life-sized,
primitive and dramatic. They were raw, crude, ugly. Most were of
women, and were definitely sexual, with protuberant breasts and
bellies, exaggerated pudenda. Rounded buttocks, with a crevicelike
crack between. Heads tended to be small, and faces minimal." The
statues' prominent sexuality, along with their lack of personal
identities, might have alerted Gillian to Dorcas' twisted involvement
with her husband's students, but, naive and easily impressed, Gillian
feels all the more curious about the couple, setting out to get to
know them better.</TE>
<TE>   After Andre critiques Gillian's formally flawless work, pointing
to its failure to take emotional risk, she feels an intense and
urgent desire to win her professor's approval, seeking him out in his
college office. Though the scenario might seem all too familiar--in
real life and in literature--Oates handles her characters with such
detail and clarity of insight as to make their situation compelling.</TE>
<TE>   Even in its understatement, "Beasts" serves as a sure indictment
of the sometimes perverse hierarchy of university life, where male
professors feel entitled to exploit their students' desires for
guidance, and even for love. But as we might have come to expect in
Oates' work, the professor-student affairs seem hardly
run-of-the-mill, with Andre's wife apparently encouraging both her
husband and his charges to feed her own perverse desires. Under the
guise of artistic inspiration, Andre and Dorcas stoop to drugging the
young women with Quaaludes, ensuring their willing participation in
the couple's creepy theatrics.</TE>
<TE>   Evil that hides itself under the cloaks of learning and art, Oates
suggests, possesses a particular repugnance, and in her telling of
Gillian's tale she creates more than sufficient sympathy for her
young character's vulnerable state. Great literature, she shows us,
can be powerfully misused:</TE>
<TE>   "The remainder of the class hour passed by in a blur. A buzzing
radiance. I saw how often Professor Harrow glanced at me, how he
seemed to be smiling at me with his eyes. He told the raptly
listening class frankly, not as if he were lecturing but as if he
were simply talking to us, confiding in us, stroking his short
spade-shaped beard that resembled D.H. Lawrence's, 'Lawrence is the
supreme poet of Eros. No recriminations, no reproaches, no guilt, no
"morality." For what's "morality" but a leash around the neck?'"</TE>
<TE>   While Oates develops Gillian with nuanced complexity, she depicts
Andre and Dorcas far more one-dimensionally. By the novel's end,
we've little doubt that they personify evil. Since it is Gillian's
point of view that the novel concerns itself with, this disparity in
character development doesn't really pose a problem. In fact, the
caricatures of Andre and Dorcas give the work something of a modern
fairy-tale flavor that effectively contrasts with its understated
tone.</TE>
<TE>   Added to her beast motif, Oates' use of fire imagery suggests a
link between misfocused primitive passion and the suffering caused by
the sheer flames of hell. And in Oates' hands, as readers may have
come to expect by now, crime will be followed by some form of
punishment. So long as readers find "Beasts'" moral certitude a
relief from the fuzzy relativism that too often plagues contemporary
literature, they will applaud the novel's dramatic conclusion.</TE>

<HD>The Father of the Relaxed and Easy Dinner Party</HD>

<LD>When friends come over for dinner and pitch in to help set the table,
or when they bring along a casserole to share, whether they know it
or not, they're following ideas popularized by Russel and Mary Wright
in the 1940s and 1950s.</LD>
<LD>   The revolutionary ideas of easy entertaining and relaxed home
design put forward by the couple are the subject of "Russel Wright:
Creating American Lifestyle" at New York City's Cooper-Hewitt,
National Design Museum, the first major retrospective of the work of
the designer and his marketing-minded wife.</LD>
<LD>   At the beginning of the 20th century, most design influences in
America came from Europe. "There was the French Art Deco of the 1920s
and the Scandinavian design in the early 1930s," says Robert
Schonfeld, co-curator with Donald Albrecht Schonfeld of the Wright
show. Into this atmosphere came Russel Wright, who was determinedly
American (he was related, on his mother's side, to two signers of the
Declaration of Independence) and created designs that celebrated
America.</LD>
<TE>   "People no longer lived in an upstairs-downstairs world," says
Schonfeld. "He and his wife, Mary, popularized the idea of making
life easier. Even today their influence is pervasive."</TE>
<TE>   Mary and Russel Wright made life easier by designing and marketing
products that were attractive, functional and affordable. Russel
Wright, who started as a theatrical set designer in the 1920s, began
designing for the home in the early 1930s. Beginning with simple
shapes in his dinnerware and other items, he moved toward cool,
metallic finishes with his spun aluminum line and finally to muted
colors and organic forms in his mature work.</TE>
<TE>   With Russel doing the designing and Mary doing the marketing, they
promoted his name as a brand and a lifestyle for America to buy into.
They coordinated all his lines, making it easy for the shopper to go
to a store and look for his name to ensure that everything would go
together. And this was long before today, when buying household-name
products such as those of Martha Stewart and Ralph Lauren is common.
"Mary was a member of the Einstein family, which included Albert, and
she had 'merchant genes,'" says Schonfeld. "Together they had
artistic and marketing genius."</TE>
<TE>   Mary Wright died in 1952, Russel in 1976. After her death, he
continued to work, but not with the prolific enthusiasm he had
before.</TE>
<TE>   His iconic American Modern dinnerware (1937) sold 80 million
pieces over 20 years. They could all be mixed and matched, which made
them versatile for the home. That was central to the Wrights' idea
expounded in their bestselling book, "Guide to Easier Living" (1950),
which helped families set up homes in the newly built suburbs. The
book defined the American lifestyle by stating that good informal
living substituted a little headwork for a lot of legwork. "It
doesn't need wealth, but it does take thought, some ingenuity and
resourcefulness, and more than a little loving care to create a home
that is really your own," they wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Just how important Russel Wright is to modern design of today both
stylistically and philosophically is easily seen in the exhibition.
Besides dinnerware, Wright also designed furniture, appliances,
textiles, interiors, buildings and landscapes. Highlights in the
exhibit of more than 350 artifacts include tabletop vignettes,
complete with Wright-designed dinnerware, flatware, linens and
accessories; a multimedia presentation of Dragon Rock, Wright's
Modernist home; America's first furniture in "blond" maple, a term
that Mary Wright coined; and Wright-designed furnishings arranged in
complete room settings.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit will remain at the Cooper-Hewitt at 2 E. 91st St. and
5th Avenue until Sept. 15. Information: (212) 849-8400 or

<HD>For That Special Paleontological Look</HD>
<DH>An El Segundo store is selling fossilized plants, fish and
bones to those in search of some prehistoric decor.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>GeoDecor's showroom in El Segundo perfectly sets up an otherworldly
prehistoric mood, a flashback to childhood trips to a natural history
museum: black walls, nearly frigid air and overhead lights that focus
on dinosaur bones and other fossils, some 100 million years old.</LD>
<LD>   But this is not a museum--everything here is for sale. Not just
meteorites, minerals and crystals, but fossilized plants, fish and
dinosaurs' bones. A small dinosaur vertebrae on a stand can be had
for $150; a large 50-million-year-old fossil palm frond goes for as
much as $150,000. While dinosaur and other fossils are routinely sold
by collectors at auction and to museums and researchers, it is a
relatively new phenomenon for them to be sold to the general public
in a retail setting.</LD>
<LD>   "I owned a quarry in Utah with Green River fish fossils that were
over 50 million years old. In around 1989, I was approached to format
fossil pieces for interior design," explains Tom Lindgren, co-owner
with his wife, Christine, of GeoDecor. From there, it wasn't a big
leap to start selling dinosaur bones as well.</LD>
<TE>   "See this little guy?" asks Lindgren, his eyes resting fondly on a
70-million-year-old Protoceratops andrewsi  with a 17-inch-long head.
Looking at the skeleton resting on an oak base, it's easy to imagine
that he may have been napping by a dune when was entombed millions of
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "He probably died in a sandstorm, and this is the actual pose he
died in. See his legs folded underneath him? This isn't something man
created. All we've done is brought out the beauty through our
preparation technique." Not everyone has the space or the money for a
full dinosaur skeleton--P. andrewsi was placed for auction at
Butterfields Los Angeles last June but didn't sell. It was estimated
to have a value  between $75,000 and $95,000.</TE>
<TE>   Lindgren says each piece is extracted by hand from the site where
it is found. Hardeners are used on the dinosaur bones while they are
still in the ground so that they don't disintegrate when they hit the
air. The bones are then put in plaster casts and transported to a
laboratory in Utah, where they are preserved with more hardeners as
they are removed from the limestone in which they were found. "Once
they are exposed to air, they go pretty quickly unless they are
preserved," Lindgren says.</TE>
<TE>   If it seems a bit odd to see a dinosaur outside of a museum, it's
quite legal under certain conditions--though not without controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all tied to where the bones come from," explains Lance
Grande, curator at Chicago's Field Museum, one of the world's largest
natural history museums. "If they come from quarries on private land,
they're legal. If they've been poached from public land, they're
not," Grande explains. "The buyer must ask for documentation to
ensure the legality. Like anything else that's valuable, they can be
stolen or faked."</TE>
<TE>   Grande says that learning the locality of the specimen is
important since, from a scientific point of view, a skeleton can be
priceless with the correct site information, and valueless without
it.</TE>
<TE>   There is clear intrinsic value to the pieces on display at
GeoDecor. Mounted and polished, many look like abstract contemporary
sculpture--even as they connect the viewer to nature and the land
before time.</TE>
<TE>   The source of many of Lindgren's dinosaur fossils is a private
quarry in eastern Wyoming that he had leased. "The [quarry] was the
site of a mass death of duck-billed dinosaurs," Lindgren says.
"There was a jumble of bones from thousands of these dinosaurs that
had just been washed and piled on top of each other, resulting in a
huge bone formation of bones sticking out all along a ravine. Over
seven years, we excavated enough bones for 10 dinosaurs. There's only
so many you can sell to museums, because most already have them and
they are not new to science."</TE>
<TE>   Lindgren has sold a number of the individual bones as decorative
objects, such as femur bones or parts of tails mounted on pedestals.
"It's quite a conversation piece," says Lindgren. "I mean, who has a
dinosaur bone?"</TE>
<TE>   Lindgren is a self-taught paleontologist whose interest in fossils
began as a hobby. He's been involved professionally in the
fossil-mineral world for 21 years and is part owner of Green River
Geological Labs Inc. in Logan, Utah, and a member of the American
Assn. of Paleontological Suppliers. Through them he has provided
specimens for museums throughout the United States. After Tom and
Christine married more than a year ago, she convinced him to relocate
to Los Angeles from Wyoming to open the now 2-month-old GeoDecor.</TE>
<TE>   Dinosaurs are a small part of GeoDecor, simply because there
aren't that many legal dinosaurs, says Tom Lindgren.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the property in the West where you find dinosaurs is
public land. It was land that people wouldn't own for its value, like
the Badlands of South Dakota. It's no good for farming, but it's an
unbelievably rich area for fossils. There are a few excavations of
dinosaur bones going on on private land right now, but most are
offered first to the scientific community."</TE>
<TE>   The world's most famous Tyrannosaurus rex, Sue, was sold to the
highest bidder by the South Dakota rancher on whose land it was
discovered. Following a lengthy legal battle over its ownership, it
was auctioned at Sotheby's in 1997 for $8.4 million. And while the
buyer at the auction might have been a private collector who could
have taken it out of circulation, it went to Chicago's Field Museum,
where the public can see it and the scientific community has access.</TE>
<TE>   Most of GeoDecor's sales come from non-dinosaur fossils, such as
palm fronds, priced from $10,000 to $150,000. Other items on display
include a bony predator fish, a Xiphactinus audax, measuring a- bout
15 feet long, from a species that swarmed the ancient shallow seas in
western Kansas during the dinosaur ages. On a lighter note, there are
whimsical Jurassic sea lilies that seem to float in their beds of
stone.</TE>
<TE>   "Many fossils here came from a subtropical environment time in
Wyoming and Colorado. Imagine: palm trees, alligators, flamingo-type
birds," says Lindgren.</TE>
<TE>   The limestone slabs holding the plant and fish fossils are
displayed as paintings would be and feature a range of colors from
aqua to brownish gold to nearly black--the darker the stone the
richer it is in organic material. The slabs are taken out layer by
layer with hand tools.</TE>
<TE>   "By preparing, restoring and collecting fossils, whether they're
for museums or private homes, they survive. And from what I've seen
in the past, private collections usually become part of museums
because collectors pass these on," says Lindgren. "I consider what we
do a modern-day treasure hunt."</TE>
<TE>   Among those who have purchased the pieces for display in their
home are Escondido collectors Keith and Judy Roynon, who have three
large fossils purchased from the Lindgrens. "Even if you're not
interested in the scientific history of them, their sheer beauty is
impressive," says Keith Roynon. "We have a rare amia fish that's 52
inches long. It's quite an architectural piece." Lindgren says he and
his wife consider the pieces "fossil art."</TE>
<TE>   In the couple's home, there are pieces incorporated into furniture
and on display as art.</TE>
<TE>   "We find that living with fossils and minerals provides a feeling
of centeredness, which helps balance us in our busy lifestyle," says
Christine Lindgren. "Their presence gives us a sense of perspective
of ourselves in the context of the vastness of time."</TE>

<HD>A Market-Fresh Look</HD>
<DH>Architectural team faced the challenge of updating a
beloved L.A. landmark.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROLYN RAMSAY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not long ago, architects Hank Koning and Julie Eizenberg won two
national design competitions within four months for bold, edgy
buildings that defy classification. Their expansion of the Pittsburgh
Children's Museum connects two beloved old stone buildings with a
structure whose pleated white plastic exterior is lit from within,
like a nightlight. Their Chicago elementary school design uses glass
to make kids inside feel like they're playing outdoors. These two
projects, Koning Eizenberg Architecture's first outside the Los
Angeles area, illustrate how this married Australian-born couple has
used an outsider's ability to question convention in order to create
innovative design. Koning, 48, and Eizenberg, 47, share a subversive
sense of humor, an easy confidence and a penchant for black clothing.
Despite the fact that their work has been mostly on their home turf,
their 20-year-old firm has established a national reputation for
designing affordable projects with a social conscience.</LD>
<LD>   "They're especially attuned to how air and light move through a
structure," said L.A. Architect editor Laura Hull. "They use a lot of
really large sliding doors that act as walls, and transform a space
from inside to outside."</LD>
<TE>   Considering the firm's reputation for unusual design and sliding
glass, it might seem an odd choice for restoring and expanding L.A.'s
historic Farmers Market at the corner of Fairfax Avenue and 3rd
Street, the funky, wood-sided structure that sells everything from
produce and meats to doughnuts and fine French cafe fare, toys,
candles and stationery. It is a landmark meeting place, founded in
1934, that has always been beloved by locals and has become a magnet
for tourists.</TE>
<TE>   The market's $45-million, 170,000-square-foot expansion, scheduled
for a March 14 unveiling, marks the firm's largest commission to
date, with four new buildings that will extend the existing retail
space and prevent it from being visually overshadowed by the Grove, a
huge retail mall being built next door and scheduled to open the same
day. Koning Eizenberg also designed a second clock tower for the
complex to anchor a new pedestrian plaza connecting the old and the
new shopping areas.</TE>
<TE>   The firm's work on the Farmers Market is the outgrowth of a series
of small mending and restoration projects that Koning and Eizenberg
have done at the market during the last two decades, many of them the
kind of forgettable but crucial paying work that can keep an
architecture firm afloat during lean years. "We did tons of little
things that our architect friends would think were crazy, because
there was no architecture in it," said Eizenberg. "It was fabulous,
because we could never have sustained a practice without that kind of
regular patronage."</TE>
<TE>   Hank Hilty, great-grandson of Farmers Market founder A.F. Gilmore
and president and chief executive of the A.F. Gilmore Co., which owns
the market, makes no claims of being an architecture critic or
patron, but he says he quickly trusted the couple when he met them,
just after they'd completed their graduate work in architecture at
UCLA. He liked the fact that his family's market reminded them of the
Victoria Market in their native Melbourne.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a very keen awareness and affinity for the style and
the manner of the market," says Hilty, who has sandy hair and
glasses. "From very early on, we used them as a firm that we would
take plans to and use them as a touchstone, the owner's architectural
consultant."</TE>
<TE>   The architects liked that the market represents the smaller,
intimate scale of regular people's everyday lives. It is the kind of
scale that appeals to them. "We do schools, we do gymnasiums, we do
community centers and we do children's museums. We do retail. It's
not to become an expert in a building type, because I'm always leery
of experts, but to provide for living on a daily basis," Eizenberg
said. Along these lines, they have designed PS No. 1 Elementary
School in Santa Monica, the Sepulveda Recreation Center in the San
Fernando Valley and the Signal Hill Golf Center, each of which is
distinguished by a playful use of strong colors in simple,
straight-forward designs.</TE>
<TE>   Couple Felt Like Outsiders</TE>
<TE>   in Their Own Culture</TE>
<TE>   Koning and Eizenberg met when they both were 18, on their first
day of architecture school at the university in Melbourne. She was
raised in an Orthodox Jewish family, and he was the son of Dutch
immigrants; both felt like outsiders in their own culture. When they
were accepted to UCLA in 1979, they married and moved to America.
Their first commission after graduation fell through, but, with a
characteristically avid jump-in-feet-first enthusiasm, they started
their own firm anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "We said, 'Well, we've already bought the pencils, so we should
hustle for work.' And we did," Koning said. "Then we got involved
with doing affordable housing. That was at a time when architects
weren't particularly interested in affordable housing, because they
didn't see it as an opportunity for design. We were fortunate enough
to get a number of awards for these small projects, and that really
helped us get credibility." Among their honors was the Progressive
Architecture First award, which they won in 1987 for their Berkeley
Street Housing project in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Eizenberg became the front person; Koning's job is to make sure
their designs are implemented properly. Drawing side-by-side at a
table, as they still do, they have designed private homes and
nonprofit housing projects. Koning got his contractor's license so
they could make extra money by building their own projects.</TE>
<TE>   They sought out and used inexpensive and environmentally friendly
materials to save money, and gained a reputation for how they used
textures. Their Santa Monica office is floored with the particleboard
that most contractors use as subflooring, and its skylights look like
industrial lamps but use only natural sunlight.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1980s, they met Hilty while working on a community
project to upgrade the Fairfax district, and Hilty asked them to make
some minor improvements to the Farmers Market. Since then, they've
also added a patio facing 3rd Street that serves market eateries like
Kokomo's and Starbucks. They also designed the new Johnny Rocket's
that faces Fairfax, and restored the 1950s-era Gilmore Bank building,
which was later demolished to make room for new development. They've
done such mundane work as adding heat lamps and removing old ceiling
tile.</TE>
<TE>   The market work came in bit by bit, even as their style evolved,
combining bold colors and shapes with spare ornamentation. Among
notable projects is the 1989 Santa Monica home they designed and
built for themselves and where they live with their two sons, 16 and
12. It's a narrow three-story structure with glass doors that open
onto a surrounding garden. The house sits back from the street in a
nest of sycamore and eucalyptus trees, and because vines cover most
of the facade, all that's visible from the street is a row of
third-story windows peeking over the foliage.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, they won a national American Institute of Architects
award for the Simone Hotel, L.A.'s first new single-room-occupancy
hotel on skid row in 30 years. This boxy, five-story yellow building
has a curved parapet that adds an unexpected cheerfulness. "They're
extremely well-respected in Los Angeles," said L.A. Architect's Hull.
"They're very calm, levelheaded, grounded people. You do feel a sense
that everything's going to be taken care of with them."</TE>
<TE>   When Hilty decided to redevelop his 31-acre plot, he looked to
Koning and Eizenberg again. For the Grove, he leased 20 acres of the
land to a developer, Caruso Affiliated Holdings, which is building an
adjacent 640,000-square-foot shopping mall--housing the likes of
Nordstrom, the Gap and Banana Republic--designed by Caruso's staff
architect, Dave Williams. At the same time, Hilty asked Koning and
Eizenberg to expand the original Farmers Market, which occupies just
50,000 square feet, so that the behemoth mall wouldn't overshadow it.</TE>
<TE>   "The market needs to continue to be part of whatever happens on
this property. It is the anchor and the cornerstone," Hilty said
recently.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a series of retail buildings between the Farmers
Market and the Grove, as well as a three-story office and retail
structure that defines the rear perimeter of the market property.
Because surface parking is such a prized feature of the market,
Koning Eizenberg also reorganized the lots so that shoppers could
pull their traditional green, wooden grocery baskets straight to
their cars without hitting a curb. They worked with Caruso in
choosing landscaping, lighting, signage and paving materials to wed
the two projects, and helped design a trolley to shuttle shoppers
between them.</TE>
<TE>   "Our directive was to look after the interests of the Farmers
Market and make sure that through this process, the market would stay
healthy," Koning said.</TE>
<TE>   Koning and Eizenberg's first three buildings form an evolutionary
progression from 3rd Street into the parking lot and through to the
rear of the property. The two-story building closest to 3rd Street is
very similar in style to the existing market, with a green shingle
roof and wood siding. The high-end culinary retailer Sur La Table
will occupy that space, beginning in March. The second structure,
which will house Bath and Body Works, is somewhat bolder--a two-story
glass box with a maroon steel-beam frame.</TE>
<TE>   The third and largest of their buildings has a white,
Teflon-coated fabric roof designed to look like a tablecloth. Cost
Plus World Market, the discount household retailer, will be one of
its tenants. Koning Eizenberg's vision was that all of the retailers
should relate to food and home. The notion of the tablecloth evolved
from a colleague's reminiscence of his Italian aunt throwing her
tablecloth over a balcony railing to shake out the crumbs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be tied back to the building, so it has this
billowy nature as it moves around the building," Hilty said. "It'll
be as white as a sheet of paper." Eizenberg described the roof as an
intentional risk: "We needed something with enough wow to contend
with the strong invented architecture that was across the road [at
the Grove]. This was one way of doing it. We're hoping to illuminate
it at night so that it can be kind of a beacon."</TE>
<TE>   The fourth building, at the back of the property, is three stories
high, with cement siding designed to evoke the original market's
clapboards. It will house small retailers, such as dry cleaners and
beauty salons on the first floor and office space on the second and
third floors.</TE>
<TE>   At the Grove, architect Williams worked with each business to
design individual facades; by contrast, he sees the Farmers Market
expansion as a vivid representation of the Koning Eizenberg style.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people around town will be able to look at it and say that's
Koning Eizenberg. It's very much an embodiment of their work. They
are," he said, "true to themselves."</TE>

<HD>Best Way to Plant Roses: Bare-Root</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even though it's the middle of winter, gardeners are busy planting
and pruning roses and fruit trees. More often than not, the weather
cooperates with sunshine, even though the days are short and
sometimes chilly. If it rains, do not dig or walk in the  beds or you
will damage the soil.</LD>
<LD>   Nurseries are chock-full of bare-root roses, which cost about half
of what roses in containers usually do. Bare-root is also the best
way to plant rosebushes.</LD>
<LD>   Soak the roots overnight, dig a whole wider than their spread, and
add amendments to the excavated soil. Make a little cone of soil at
the bottom of the hole and spread the roots over it. Refill the hole,
carefully packing soil around the roots.</LD>
<TE>   The swelling above the roots, the "bud union" should end up above
soil level. Thoroughly water, then mound amendment over the canes to
protect from hot sun and drying winds.</TE>
<TE>   When sprouts appear, wash them away and letthem become mulch.</TE>
<TE>   Rose pruning demonstration by rosarium horticulturist Wen-Pehn
Wang at 10 a.m. Saturday at the Descanso Gardens, 1418 Descanso
Drive, La Canada Flintridge. Free with garden admission of $5. For
information, call (818) 952-4401.</TE>

<DH>A Learning Link to Peter Rabbit</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many people do not know that the Peter Rabbit made famous in the
stories written by Beatrix Potter was actually based on a real
rabbit. He was one of the many pets the author enjoyed as a child.</LD>
<LD>   The real-life Peter Rabbit lived with Potter in her London home
from 1892 to 1901. He stayed in a cage in the garden. Potter loved
animals so much that she often let Peter inside the house for visits.
Peter would sleep in front of the fireplace like a pet cat or dog.</LD>
<LD>   In 1893, Potter wrote and illustrated a letter to 5-year-old Noel
Moore, the son of Potter's former governess and good friend. The
letter was actually a story about her pet rabbit Peter.</LD>
<TE>   Seven years later, the story had become so popular with friends
and family that Potter decided to turn the letter into a little
picture book that included black-and-white pictures she drew herself.</TE>
<TE>   Potter sent the book to many publishers, but when they rejected
her story, she decided to print it herself. She gave copies of "The
Tale of Peter Rabbit" to people she knew.</TE>
<TE>   Soon the books caught the eye of the London publishing firm
Frederick Warne &amp; Co. The company agreed to publish the tale if
Potter could create color pictures. She used watercolors to
illustrate the story, and the book as we know it today was published
in October 1902.</TE>
<TE>   In the 100 years since, the book has been reprinted more than 250
times and translated into more than 35 languages. Peter Rabbit will
celebrate his 100th birthday this year.</TE>

<LD>These are some of the New Year's resolutions from Leslee Estin's

<LD>   * I hope to get more education because every teacher I have is
very smart. They got me to this level. I might even become the
smartest person ever.--Eric, 10</LD>

smarter. I will increase my reading. I'll work on telling the truth
and helping my brother and sister more.--Dora, 10</LD>
<TE>   * I'm going to make a vow to come to school on time and make sure
that I'm prepared to do my best. I also am going to stop acting lazy
and help my mother when she needs me.--Lukesha</TE>
<TE>   * My resolution is to respect others. I will keep my hands, feet
and other objects to myself. Also, I will learn to do all my work. I
will stop going to the principal. I'll keep my voice down in class.
Most of all, I will stop talking back to people. I'll treat people
how I would like to be treated.--Ashley, 9</TE>
<TE>   * I want to help my mom more often because when she gets home from
work she's always tired.--Kiandrea, 10</TE>
<TE>   * I am going to get good grades on all my tests so I can grow up

<HD>Star Power, Frozen in Time</HD>
<DH>Exhibition of candid shots from 1954-60 documents Hollywood
at play in Palm Springs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VERONIQUE de TURENNE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This was the good life.</LD>
<LD>   Frank Sinatra relaxing after a great steak, surrounded by friends,
the table strewn with heavy-bottomed cocktail glasses. Women in
pearls, in diamonds the size of ice cubes. Men in stylish shirts,
gold cuff links glinting in the candlelight. Laughing, everyone
laughing.</LD>
<LD>   It was Palm Springs in the 1950s, and photographer William
Anderson saw it all. Shot it all. Collected hundreds of images of
Hollywood's stars golfing, swimming, dining and playing. As official
photographer for the Racquet Club of Palm Springs from 1950 to 1971,
Anderson spent almost every weekend blending into the background with
his camera.</LD>
<TE>   Excerpts from the resulting body of work have become a popular
draw at the Palm Springs Desert Museum. The current installment,
"Stars at Play," features two dozen photographs Anderson shot in Palm
Springs between 1954 and 1960.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the ultimate representation of the Hollywood fantasy,"
said Robert Landau, who co-authored "Hollywood Poolside," a book of
photos that chronicles celebrities' love affairs with their swimming
pools. "It was irresistible--sex, fame and riches, all in an ideal
setting."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's subjects infused even the most ordinary actions with
glamour. Whether polishing off a steak, belting back some scotch or
posing prettily on a chaise longue, the stars made their actions seem
important.</TE>
<TE>   "These were people with the ability to light up for the camera,"
Landau said. "And even in so-called candid shots, they were certainly
aware whenever a camera was being pointed at them."</TE>
<TE>   In 1956, the camera caught a giggly Donna Reed at a cocktail
party, surrounded by women in seriously high-fashion cocktail
dresses. At a birthday party in 1959, Kirk Douglas listened to an
elegantly dressed Janet Leigh, a tangle of four charm bracelets on
her left wrist.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1958 photo with Jane Powell, Liberace's gilded tux, golden
bow tie and candelabrum-shaped pinky ring hinted at the flamboyance
yet to come. And in a 1960 bikini shot, Jayne Mansfield, all dewy
lips, platinum hair and copious cleavage, pioneered the Baywatch
babe.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very interesting, because Pam Anderson is definitely the
Jayne Mansfield of our day," said Charles Phoenix, whose book
"Southern California in the '50s: Sun, Fun and Fantasy" was released
by Angel City Press this year. "They're not great actresses, but each
worked to become someone we're all willing to take a second look at."</TE>
<TE>   As is the decade the photos span.</TE>
<TE>   "The 1950s are a period of time we tend to glamorize," said
Phoenix. "We think of it as simpler somehow, though that, too, is a
fantasy."</TE>
<TE>   There's little in Anderson's photos to suggest that intensive
change was taking place across the globe. In 1955, the year Kirk
Douglas mugged for the camera with his sons, President Eisenhower
suffered a heart attack, and the Rev. Martin Luther King led a
boycott of segregated buses in Montgomery, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   In the winter of 1956-57, Anderson snapped Robert Wagner and
Natalie Wood flirting on a golf course. News of the day had Israel
invading the Sinai Peninsula, Grace Kelly marrying the Prince of
Monaco, and Albert Sabin developing the first oral polio vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   By 1960, as Anderson caught a pensive Audrey Hepburn perched with
her Yorkshire terrier at the edge of a beach chair, the pill made its
debut in doctors' offices, and the Cold War was in full swing.</TE>
<TE>   But the Palm Springs that made its way into Anderson's photographs
tended to pleasure and leisure. In the 21 years he photographed the
rich and famous during "the season" at the Racquet Club, Anderson
concentrated on the stars at play.</TE>
<TE>   After his death in 1973, Anderson's widow, Dorothy, donated his
negatives to the Palm Springs Desert Museum. With regular exhibitions
of a portion of the collection, glamorous midcentury Hollywood stars
stay ever-young.</TE>
<TE>   "These photos are always one of the most popular exhibits," said
Toni Decker, a museum spokeswoman. "Older people look at them to
remember, and the younger ones are very interested in learning what
people looked like back then, and how things used to be."</TE>
<TE>   "Stars at Play" will be on view at the Palm Springs Desert Museum,
(760) 325-0189, through March 3.</TE>

<HD>The Music Box</HD>
<DH>Part 4 The story so far: Izzy's dog, Lance, has caused her
to drop a precious family heirloom from her Grammy.</DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Lance!" Izzy cried.</LD>
<LD>   She quickly scooped up the old music box. Luckily, there wasn't a
scratch on it. But when she lifted its lid, the melody was gone.</LD>
<LD>   "Let me try," said her mother, winding its key. But the music box
fell silent.</LD>
<TE>   Izzy burst into tears.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother wrapped her arms around Izzy, trying to comfort her.</TE>
<TE>   "Wait, there's a music box store at the mall," she recalled. "If
they sell them, chances are they can fix them, too."</TE>
<TE>   Izzy followed her to the family car. As they backed out the
driveway, she couldn't help but notice the tattling katydids in the
droopy willow tree.</TE>
<TE>   "Katy did! Katy did!" the insects squawked.</TE>
<TE>   "No, Lance did," she said sadly.</TE>
<TE>   It was Izzy's first visit to the specialty store. The sparkling
glass countertops made her think of Cinderella's glass slipper. A
salesclerk placed a twirling ballerina inside a glass case next to an
old-time tin soldier.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother explained the mishap, then handed over the mute
heirloom.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll show it to our MBD," the clerk said.</TE>
<TE>   "Your who?" asked Izzy.</TE>
<TE>   "Our Music Box Doc," the clerk explained as she carried it over to
him. Using rapid hand gestures, they spoke a silent language.</TE>
<TE>   At first Izzy felt uncomfortable, but then she was fascinated by
their secret code.</TE>
<TE>   The doc examined the music box as the clerk reached for a bottle
of blue glass cleaner and a soft cloth.</TE>
<TE>   "But how can he fix it if he can't hear?" Izzy curiously asked her
mother.</TE>
<TE>   "Izzy. Your manners," her mother reminded her.</TE>
<TE>   The doc smiled. Even though he couldn't hear their conversation,

<HD>Selecting, Serving Cheese That Will Please</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shopping for cheese can be as much fun as serving it to guests.</LD>
<LD>   The first rule is know your cheese, according to the Culinary
Institute of America. And while experts differ on the specifics,
"Garde Manger: The Art and Craft of the Cold Kitchen" (Wiley) offers
up these basic categories: fresh, rind-ripened, semisoft, blue, hard
and very hard.</LD>
<LD>   * Fresh cheeses are uncooked and unripened and have a creamy
flavor and soft texture. These cheeses are typically the most
perishable and are sometimes kept in brine to preserve their
freshness. Examples of soft fresh cheeses include cottage cheese,
queso blanco, cream cheese and homemade lemon cheese.</LD>
<TE>   * Rind-ripened cheeses are typically sprayed or dusted with a mold
to promote ripening. Two of the most popular are Brie and Camembert.
Soft-ripened cheeses are available in varying degrees of richness and
may be labeled as single, double and triple creams, indicating their
fat content.</TE>
<TE>   * Semisoft cheeses include a wide variety, ranging from mild and
buttery to pungent and aromatic with Limburger, its American
counterpart Liederkranz, Muenster, Bel Paese and Havarti, among them.
Some, such as Gouda and Edam are sealed in wax before the aging
process begins. These cheeses are sometimes flavored or smoked and
are sold in mild and aged varieties.</TE>
<TE>   * Blue cheeses are injected with a mold, then salted or brined and
allowed to ripen in caves or in cave-like conditions. French
Roquefort, Italian Gorgonzola, English Stilton and American Maytag
Blue are among the most famous.</TE>
<TE>   * There is a wide variety of hard cheeses produced around the
world. Cheddars (including Monterey Jack, Colby and Longhorn) and
Swiss-style cheeses (Gruyere, Emmental, Beaufort and Jarlsberg) are
among the best known.</TE>
<TE>   * Very hard, or grating, cheeses are known in Italy as granas. The
most popular of these cheeses are Romano and Parmesan. Parmigiano
Reggiano, the most prized Parmesan cheese, is often referred to as
the king of cheeses. Many believe that the formula for this cheese
has not changed in more than 700 years, and that its origins date
back even further.</TE>
<TE>   A tip when making your selection: Look for cheeses that are neatly
sliced and wrapped, with appropriate signs of aging and ripeness.
Some cheeses may be highly aromatic, even pungent, but they should
not smell strongly of ammonia; that indicates that the cheese is well
past its prime. There should be no signs of drying or cracking,
evidence the cheese has not been handled properly.</TE>
<TE>   Once you've made your purchase, wrap the cheeses well and
refrigerate. Fresh soft cheeses can last under home-storage
conditions for three or four days. Semisoft, hard and blue cheeses
can last about two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   To serve, arrange the cheese and let it come to room temperature
for about one to two hours to bring out the fullest flavor. A cheese
board is a traditional way to present cheese. Line the board
decoratively with clean leaves.</TE>
<TE>   Serving platters, mirrors or marble pieces are also effective ways
to present cheese.</TE>
<TE>   If you are serving cheeses in blocks, provide knives. Use small
tongs or forks for sliced cheeses.</TE>
<TE>   Bread and crackers go well with cheese. They can be subtly
flavored, or they may add some kick of their own. Sourdough,
country-style or peasant breads, rye, pumpernickel or crackers from
strongly flavored grains such as rye or whole wheat or those with
added flavors, including seeds, spices, peppercorns and cheese, can
all be effective.</TE>
<TE>   Add some fresh and dried fruits and nuts, both for appearance and
the refreshing counterpoint they add to the cheese experience.</TE>
<TE>   Wine, beer and cider also make great partners for cheese. Classic
examples of taste pairing include apples and cheddar with hard cider,
or pears and blue cheese and walnuts with port.</TE>
<TE>   Select the accompaniments with the same care you did the cheese.</TE>

<HD>Welcoming Comfort Food</HD>
<DH>Smitty's Grill fills a menu with familiar favorites and
cocktails for the nostalgic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD>TIMES RESTAURANT CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Comfort food is making a comeback in the new year as restaurateurs
rush to fill a yearning for old-fashioned, home-style American food.
Just in time, the owners of Parkway Grill, Crocodile Cafe and Arroyo
Chop House in Pasadena have retooled the restaurant they owned at 110
S. Lake Ave. The high-end Asian fusion concept called Ducz never
really took flight, so in December, the Smith brothers redecorated
and opened as Smitty's Grill. And already, it seems to be a go.</LD>
<LD>   On a weekday night, the bar is thronged, cheerful under the
Christmas lights. The bartender keeps a constant flow of martinis,
Cosmopolitans and Old Fashioneds coming, and the cooks, seen through
the kitchen window, are jamming. The noise level is raucous. By some
peculiar trick of acoustics, I can hear the conversations in either
booth to the side of ours perfectly but have trouble catching the
ends of sentences at our table.</LD>
<LD>   Smitty's menu is a no-brainer: shrimp cocktail, Caesar and Cobb
salads, steak chili, steaks and ribs, and for dessert, Fosselman's
ice cream.</LD>
<TE>   Corn bread comes in a blackened iron skillet, in the sweet
Southern style. The appetizer-sized barbecued pork ribs take the edge
off your appetite, but if you really want to go retro, there's bean
and cheddar dip and even garlic cheese bread. But no Swedish
meatballs, which date more or less from the same era.</TE>
<TE>   Set off in the center of the brown paper menu is a box listing
Smitty's specials, which include a floury chicken pot pie, a
pan-fried pork chop, a plate of calves' liver and bacon, and
"Marion's famous meatloaf." On a first visit, though, most of the
food I tried was more workmanlike than anything else.</TE>
<TE>   The best items turned out to be the straightforward prime rib
listed as roasted on the bone--well, I should hope so--and the hot
fudge sundae, which is embellished with not one but three
sauces--that chocolate fudge, plus butterscotch and caramel.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the average food, Smitty's is bursting with diners. The
place does have an easygoing, all-American charm.</TE>
<TE>   Cocktails are tailor-made for the nostalgic. It's easy to park, so
it doesn't take a big effort to stop in for a quick supper. In short,
it offers all the comfort of the familiar.</TE>
<TE>   Smitty's Grill, 110 S. Lake Ave., Pasadena; (626) 792-9999.
Appetizers $4 to $12; main courses $10.50 to $24.95. Open daily for
dinner; Monday through Friday for lunch.</TE>

<HD>DirecTV, DishNetwork Expand Channel Lineups</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two leading satellite television operators have started broadcasting
more local channels in the largest U.S. cities, eliminating one of
the last major differences between their lineups and cable TV.</LD>
<LD>   Hughes Electronics Corp.'s DirecTV and EchoStar Communications
Corp.'s DishNetwork had been carrying only the most popular local
stations in selected markets--41 cities for DirecTV, 36 for
DishNetwork.</LD>
<LD>   Spurred by a federal deadline, however, the two services have
begun offering a more complete lineup of local stations in those
markets, including public broadcasters and independent stations.</LD>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the change will add about 15 stations to the
satellite lineups. The companies said the expansion wouldn't change
the price of the local-channel package, which is $5 to $6 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Congress had given satellite operators until Jan. 1 to carry all
the local stations wherever they offered any local channels, just as
cable operators must do.</TE>
<TE>   DirecTV and EchoStar unsuccessfully fought the mandate in Congress
and in court, saying they didn't have the capacity to carry every
local channel in more than a few dozen communities.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar now is attempting to buy DirecTV, arguing that the
combination would enable it to carry local channels in more cities.</TE>
<TE>   Now that parity has been achieved on the local front, the main
programming advantage for some cable systems is the ability to watch
movies on demand.</TE>
<TE>   DirecTV's main edge is exclusive sports packages, such as NFL
games, while DishNetwork offers the most extensive lineup of
foreign-language channels.</TE>
<TE>   DishNetwork also offers KCBS' high-definition TV signal in Los
Angeles, which the cable operators have yet to add to their systems.</TE>

<HD>Net's Father Knows Best</HD>
<DH>Thanks to technology, pioneer Vint Cerf is ready to conquer
new worlds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vint Cerf is best known as one of the fathers of the Internet. But
he's not just another geek with transistor envy. Technology literally
made him the man he is. Cerf, 58 years old, has worn hearing aids
since he was 13.</LD>
<LD>   His day job is senior vice president for Internet architecture and
technology with WorldCom, but he continues working as an Internet
evangelist, holding top positions with some of the key groups that
keep the worldwide network of networks together. And in his spare
time, he holds down an appointment at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
where he's working on a design to expand Internet connectivity to
outer space and even other planets.</LD>
<LD>   Cerf lives in Northern Virginia, with his wife of 35 years,
Sigrid, who also is hearing impaired. They have two grown sons.</LD>
<TE>   DESKTOP: We have a lot. I was actually amused the other day when I
went down to the basement and found three machines running, which
made a total of five going in the house. And this is a house where
two people are living.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Why so many boxes?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Before the boys moved out, it was either get everybody
their own computer or schedule time on the machine. And I didn't want
to take the 3 a.m.-to-5 a.m. slot, so everybody got one, and then the
kids left their equipment behind. What surprises me is that sometimes
all these computers are in use.</TE>
<TE>   Q: That does seem a little odd, now that you mention it.</TE>
<TE>   A: Yeah, but when you have all those systems, you find yourself
dedicating machines to single tasks. We use one just to do our
finances, for example.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How about laptops?</TE>
<TE>   A: I carry an IBM Thinkpad. My wife has a Titanium Mac, which I
like, but which gets pretty hot. My initial reaction was, gee, I
wanted a laptop, not a weenie roast.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Ouch. Any operating system preferences?</TE>
<TE>   A: No, we try to be as eclectic as possible. The only thing
missing is a Linux server, which I just haven't done yet because I
haven't made the time.</TE>
<TE>   HAND-HELD: I have a Palm. I use it mostly for scheduling. Mostly
the calendar and address book. I haven't found it really comfortable
to do Web surfing, since it's such a small, limited display. I do
take short notes on it.... I wonder what future archeologists are
going to think when they notice how, all of a sudden, our handwriting
changed because so many of us use Graffiti with our Palms now.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is portability important to you?</TE>
<TE>   A: Tremendously important, but it's funny, things are less
portable than I'd like. When I travel I have to lug around a black
bag with wheels. It's filled with power converters, batteries,
adaptors for telephone systems, coax cable, radio transceivers.</TE>
<TE>   Q: So you've still got to carry around a ton of stuff to make sure
your "portable" equipment interacts with things like the indigenous
power supply.</TE>
<TE>   A: Plus there's a large number of devices such as the Palm and
cell phone that I have to carry. I keep thinking that I need to get a
Batman belt to carry all this. But things are getting better. You see
a Palm with a GPS, Palm with a telephone attachment.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What other stuff do you wear on your belt?</TE>
<TE>   A: Two-way pagers. My favorite is a Motorola that I've tailored to
pick up news items and things like that. It turned out to be quite
useful when things were so awful on Sept. 11. I was stuck in a
basement in Chicago and couldn't dial out, but I could stay in touch
with people using instant messaging and e-mail. Thinking about how
well that worked afterward actually got me excited, because the
Internet seemed to play this vital role in linking everything
together. My pet fantasy is that virtually all communications
technology should interlink in some fashion. Why can't you send
e-mail from the phone, if that's the best way to get the message?</TE>
<TE>   HOME THEATER/ STEREO SYSTEM: It's nothing fancy, especially
compared with some of the systems my friends have. We're not big home
theater fan folks, we have a few big-screen TVs and DVD players.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How has technology changed your life?</TE>
<TE>   A: Technology is my life. My hearing has degraded steadily over
the years, but fortunately the technology has improved along with it,
so I haven't lost any ground.</TE>
<TE>   Q: I remember calling you late at night at your home a few years
ago and being absolutely stunned when Sigrid answered the phone.</TE>
<TE>   A: (Laughter) Yeah, that was right after she got her first
cochlear implant. That first one had electronics that clipped on the
belt. She literally just got back from Johns Hopkins yesterday with a
new one that hangs behind the ear. This technology means people with
significant hearing loss can talk on the telephone. It's truly life
altering.</TE>
<TE>   And the most important thing apart from Sigrid's implant is the
Internet. It's changed things for me in a significant way. My ability
to get information in a hurry really astonishes me. It's been
incredibly exciting and satisfying to see all these new applications
pop up.</TE>
<TE>   I do worry about an increasingly complex society, worry about
things becoming so complex that the future becomes fragile. But
basically, technology has improved our lives, and I'm grateful to
have it.</TE>

<AU>ROBERT BURNS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The new year just doesn't feel right. By 2002, shouldn't we have
colonized the moon and be wearing unisex tunics and living in
communities that look like the Getty Museum campus? Our car doesn't
even fly.</LD>
<LD>   But that's what some of the prognosticators of the last century
saw, proving that doing the Nostradamus business is tricky at best.</LD>
<LD>   So as we stumble into 2002, it may be time to take a look at what
today's futurists see.</LD>
<TE>   At The Book of Hope (www.thebookof hope.com) the future is warm
and fuzzy, at least for some of us.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for example, the Cryonic Alternative: "By 2050, billions of
volunteers in starving Third World nations will opt to freeze to
await a less populated and better future perhaps a millennium away."
It might work. Many of the "volunteers" probably don't know what snow
is.</TE>
<TE>   And we won't notice the cold snap, anyway, because according to
the book, we'll be too busy with Love-Bots: "By 2040, people in the
developed world will make love to humanistic robots call Love-Bots
more often than to the 'real thing.'"</TE>
<TE>   The Love-Bots could bite back, though. Exit Mundi
(www.xs4all.nl/~mke/exit mundi.htm), a collection of
end-of-the-world scenarios, warns of the threat of robots killing off
humans sometime around 2040 to 2050. Maybe they'll look like Arnold
Schwarzenegger and, you know, time travel.</TE>
<TE>   But if the Mayans are right, we won't even get to 2040. Exit Mundi
points out that the Maya had a "long count" calendar, which runs from
the beginning to the end of time, with, like, no refills. Time runs
out on Dec. 21, 2012, so once again it will be time to party like
it's 1999.</TE>
<TE>   You don't have to rely on the Maya to pick an ending. Chris Nelson
has assembled doomsday prophecies, past and present, at A Brief
History of the Apocalypse (www.chrisnelson.net). From the rapture to
"space brothers" landing, you can pick your favorite date and demise.</TE>
<TE>   We were relieved to know that Sir Isaac Newton was wrong: "Even
Sir Isaac Newton was bitten by the millennium bug. He predicted that
Christ's Millennium would begin in the year 2000 in his book
'Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of
St. John.'"</TE>
<TE>   More on the end can be found on "It's the End of the World as We
Know It ... Again" at www.geocities.com/Athens/
Oracle/9941/index.html. With sections such as "A Doom Is a Wish Your
Heart Makes" and "Exorcising Poor Last Judgment," we'll even forgive
the irritating GeoCities ads.</TE>
<TE>   If there is an apocalypse, surely someone will survive, right? Get
tips at SurvivingTheApocalypse.com (www.surviving theapocalypse.com).
You might want to plan on your own cave, because a majority of their
readers don't seem to have a problem with cannibalism. According to a
site poll, 36% would resort to cannibalism "only as utterly needed"
but 38% got pretty excited about it, saying, "Yes, and enough to stay
healthy."</TE>
<TE>   But what about the end of pain, suffering and the beginning of
unisex tunics? Some see the future as a "transhuman" world, but then
it's hard to be a transvestite in a unisex tunic.</TE>
<TE>   Transhumanist resources can be found at www.aleph.se/Trans, with
links to put you on the path to transhumanism. Although if the Maya
are right, it might be a waste of time.</TE>
<TE>   At Paradise Engineering (www.paradise-engineering.com), the
Hedonistic Imperative promises that "genetic engineering and
nanotechnology will enable us to get rid of suffering in all sentient
life." And if you can't, hey, just freeze it.</TE>
<TE>   Trans or not, Utopia is the place to be. Read about the search for
Utopia at the New York Public Library
(www.nypl.org/utopia/homepage_qt.html) and then visit it at an
imaginary island nation called Bergonia (www.bergonia.org), which
demonstrates that even if you can build a paradise you may not be
able to name it.</TE>
<TE>   Whether they see total annihilation or complete bliss,
prognosticators often wallow in absolutism. We're just thankful the
future is not now.</TE>

<DH>The graphical user interface changed computing. But what's
on the horizon?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC B. HANSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Point. Click. Drag.</LD>
<LD>   Point. Click. Drag.</LD>
<LD>   Tired of operating personal computers like this? A lot of
researchers are, and they're trying to change the way people interact
with the ubiquitous beige boxes by creating virtual spaces that take
into account the way people behave in the real world.</LD>
<TE>   When Apple introduced the Macintosh and its graphical user
interface, or GUI, in 1984, the folders, windows, icons, menus and
mouse pointer that made up the desktop took the computing world by
storm. It was quite a change from the black-and-green screens and
obscure commands that had dominated personal computing until then.</TE>
<TE>   Pioneered in the 1970s at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center,
popularized by Apple in the 1980s and embedded into daily life by
Microsoft in the 1990s, the GUI ushered in a new era of computing.</TE>
<TE>   But that was 18 years ago. Things have changed.</TE>
<TE>   The first Mac had no hard drive. Today, hard drives are packed
with gigabytes' worth of MP3s, digital photos and word-processing
documents. Back then, there was no World Wide Web, and e-mail was
virtually nonexistent. Today, the Web is everywhere and in-boxes
overflow with messages.</TE>
<TE>   All of which leads to a sort of information glut.</TE>
<TE>   "The Windows environment is not the environment that is going to
take us into next century," said David Gelernter, a professor of
computer science at Yale University and chief science officer at
Mirror World Technologies. "It's out of control. It's out of hand. It
was designed for a vastly different and vastly simpler information
world."</TE>
<TE>   So in the same way that computer scientists in the 1970s sought a
more user-friendly interface, researchers of today are investigating
whether there is something better than Windows and Mac OS.</TE>
<TE>   "When you give a digital camera to someone and they can take
thousands of photos, the task of managing those photos, of organizing
them, of sending them to other people or just browsing them, becomes
terribly hard with the current interface," said Daniel C. Robbins,
3-D Interface Designer at Microsoft Research. "We're trying to make
that easier."</TE>
<TE>   Robbins believes that one way to deal with the massive amounts of
data on computers is to transform the flat digital desktop into a
three-dimensional landscape that works with the natural human ability
to organize information spatially.</TE>
<TE>   The idea, Robbins explained, is that a 3-D environment would
provide a sense of "place," which the countless layers of
similar-looking folders of the current desktop fail to do. A 3-D
environment would have "landmarks" that people could use to group
information as they see fit.</TE>
<TE>   One test project, called Data Mountain, presents users with a 3-D
view of a mountain range that is used as a file storage environment.
The easily recognizable cues that the mountains provide, such as
hills, valleys, paths and rivers, allow users to orient themselves in
the 3-D space while giving them the freedom to put files wherever
they choose.</TE>
<TE>   "When you start putting things in a hierarchy, in folders, it
almost makes that structure sacred and you become very afraid to mess
with it," Robbins said. "If you give people a more free-form space
with rich cues, it lets them move things around and make ephemeral
relationships that change over time, because really the way we want
to look at our information completely changes depending on the task
and the context of what we're doing."</TE>
<TE>   In future versions of Data Mountain, Robbins anticipates that the
environment will react to a user's habits. So if a user put files
that they often delete in a certain place, the environment might
start to form a chasm into which files can be dumped and deleted.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, if a user stores files for a long time in a certain
area, those files might start to look like ice, indicating they have
not been used but are safely stored. The idea is to make the
environment react to a person's habits while keeping the environment
stable so that actions can be easily remembered and repeated.</TE>
<TE>   But different people have different spatial abilities, so a set
3-D environment wouldn't work for everyone. Robbins envisions a
personalized system that would use artificial intelligence techniques
to adapt and refine a basic environment into a customized system.</TE>
<TE>   "We would imagine that the system would, when you first encounter
the computer of the future, somehow in an unobtrusive and hopefully
fun way, assess your spatial abilities and the kinds of view you
would want to live in,'' Robbins said.</TE>
<TE>   "One person might have a metaphor that looks like a forest," he
said. "Someone else might have a more abstract metaphor that would
approximate living inside a Kandinsky painting with just abstract
geometry that you personally have assigned meaning to. The space
should really be tuned to the user."</TE>
<TE>   Gelernter also sees 3-D landscapes as a way to escape the
messiness of the desktop metaphor, but said few mainstream computer
programmers have demonstrated the ability to create something
consumers can use.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to see a lot of 3-D systems that insofar as they are
three- and not two-dimensional, are even more preposterously
complicated than current Windows-type environments," he said. "This
is a new degree of freedom, and I think most of the industry has not
shown that it makes very good use of that freedom."</TE>
<TE>   His alternative is called Scopeware, a system he developed at Yale
and then spun off into a commercial product with his company, Mirror
Worlds Technologies. Scopeware departs from the hierarchy of folders
in the desktop by placing every piece of information, from e-mail to
bookmarks to photos to office documents, into a "stream" organized
chronologically.</TE>
<TE>   The stream is a straight line of documents organized onto what
looks like cascading cards that stretch back into the past and
forward into the future. Nothing has a name. When you scroll over a
card, a thumbnail and description of the data pop up to the side.</TE>
<TE>   The research system is based on peer-to-peer technology, which
allows computers to share data directly with other computers. The
idea is that when a user creates a document on a desktop computer, it
also shows up at the front of the stream on a laptop or hand-held
without extra effort.</TE>
<TE>   Peer-to-peer also would allow users to tune into other streams,
perhaps those of a business partner or newspaper, and seamlessly
integrate their public content into a private stream.</TE>
<TE>   Other user-interface researchers are less critical of the desktop,
but see an issue with devising interfaces that work equally well on
the desktop and the burgeoning number of mobile devices.</TE>
<TE>   The GUI "is an interface that works pretty darn well on a display
sitting in your office, doing office kind of work," said Jock
Mackinlay, a member of the research staff at Xerox PARC. "But for
mobile devices there is an obvious problem, which is that the
standard GUI doesn't work. The display on my Palm or my mobile phone
is just too small to support the windows and the menus."</TE>
<TE>   Mackinlay said he sees mobile devices making use of speech
technology and incorporating "big but small displays," which would
either fold into something pocket-size or utilize a tiny projector
that could display information on any flat surface.</TE>
<TE>   Still others envision moving away from the computer as a separate
device. Hiroshi Ishii, associate professor of media arts and sciences
at MIT's Media Laboratory, seeks to build upon the concept of
"ubiquitous computing," the seamless melding of technology with
everyday objects, pioneered by late scientist Mark Weiser.</TE>
<TE>   "The GUI was so successful that people ... tried to remove the
physical models and physical practices, and tried to imitate
everything in the digital world," Ishii said. "To me, that seems to
be wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii wants to bring a "tangible" interface to applications.
Instead of staring at a screen and manipulating a mouse to do work,
Ishii thinks direct physical manipulation of objects that take
advantage of computers is a more natural and useful way to deal with
technology.</TE>
<TE>   For example, as an alternative to logging on to a Web site to
check the weather, Ishii helped design a bottle that reveals sounds
corresponding to the day's weather when opened. A sunny, warm day
might sound like chirping birds, while a rainy day might emit sounds
of thunder.</TE>
<TE>   Urban planning is one of many areas in which Ishii believes
tangible interfaces are superior to computer simulations. He was
involved with a project that enables urban planners to manipulate
models of buildings on a table; a computer detects their orientations
and positions.</TE>
<TE>   "Urban planners have used physical models of buildings for 5,000
years," Ishii said. "Now computers provide advanced simulations, but
they are inside the computer and separate from a physical model....
People can solve this problem by moving buildings, like kids move
Lego blocks. It's much more natural and direct."</TE>

<HD>Online Jukeboxes: Britney but No 'Boss'</HD>
<DH>Authorized services let users tap vast vaults as long as
they don't stray from their PCs and can do without key artists.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine walking into a candy store where half the bins are empty, and
the owner makes you eat everything you buy before you leave.</LD>
<LD>   That's what it's like to use the online music services controlled
by the major record companies: Pressplay and MusicNet. Representing a
new generation of industry-approved, on-demand services, they promise
to provide the music you want to hear, when you want to hear it.</LD>
<LD>   But neither has the breadth of music needed to deliver on that
promise. And both require you to do most of your listening at your
computer.</LD>
<TE>   Granted, their vaults contain lots of songs--about 100,000 each.
The selection grows daily. But they don't come close to matching the
selection or portability of the unauthorized free services. Unless
and until the courts shut down file-sharing operations such as
MusicCity's Morpheus, those services will continue to set a high
standard for the competition to meet.</TE>
<TE>   The problems are not unique to Pressplay and MusicNet. None of the
authorized on-demand services, which also include Listen .com's
Rhapsody and Streamwaves, has lined up the licenses needed to cover
the entire waterfront of music. And only one, EMusic, lets you move
all the music you buy onto CDs and portable devices.</TE>
<TE>   These shortcomings aren't necessarily fatal flaws, even when the
fee is $10 or more a month. The key is to provide more than what
consumers can get from other legitimate sources.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the first versions of Pressplay and MusicNet offer
much more music for the money than CDs and give listeners more
control than radio stations do. The trade-off is that both services
are narrowly focused on Windows computers, at least initially. And if
you don't spend a lot of time online at your PC, it's hard to justify
spending upward of $120 a year on these services instead of buying
eight to 10 CDs.</TE>
<TE>   From Product to Service</TE>
<TE>   Computers and the Internet are changing the nature of the music
business, enabling record companies to sell music as a service
instead of a plastic product. Ultimately, analysts predict, consumers
no longer will fill their shelves with CDs. They will simply buy
access to a complete library of songs online, delivered through wires
or the airwaves.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of independent labels have made their catalogs available
online at the EMusic site, www .emusic.com, where users can download
versions of the companies' songs for a flat monthly fee. Like the
music on CDs, these MP3 files come with no limits on copying or
transferring to portable devices.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from EMI, the major record companies have moved gingerly
when it comes to online distribution. Instead of the widely used but
easily duplicated MP3 format, they have stuck with encrypted formats
that can't be copied freely, moved to portable devices or recorded
onto CD.</TE>
<TE>   They also have split into two camps, creating competing online
music distributors. The corporate parents of Warner Music, BMG and
EMI formed MusicNet with RealNetworks Inc., and Universal Music Group
and Sony Music launched Pressplay.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to songs from the catalogs of its three owners,
MusicNet distributes music from Zomba Recording, home of teen-pop
faves Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync. Pressplay,
meanwhile, offers music from Universal, Sony and EMI--despite EMI's
stake in rival MusicNet--as well as half a dozen smaller, independent
labels.</TE>
<TE>   Neither service, however, has the rights to all the music in its
backers' catalogs. That means no Beatles, Rolling Stones, Garth
Brooks or Bruce Springsteen. And some other top artists are
represented by only a portion of their work--typically, older albums
with minuscule current sales.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal law, an online music service cannot offer songs on
demand unless it has struck deals with the labels and the music
publishers for the rights to those tracks. Except for EMI, the labels
have been slow to grant such licenses, even to one another.</TE>
<TE>   Pressplay and MusicNet representatives say they are determined to
get licenses from all the major labels and significant independents.
Until they do, however, their lineups are like aging sweaters--too
thin to keep you warm. And unless you subscribe, it's hard to tell
whether either service will have the artists and songs you like.</TE>
<TE>   Pressplay made its debut last month on Yahoo, MSN Music and Roxio,
each linked from www .pressplay.com. The service on each is the same,
as Pressplay doesn't allow its marketing partners to fiddle with the
knobs.</TE>
<TE>   MusicNet, on the other hand, relies on its retailers to shape the
look and feel of the service. The first outlet is RealNetworks, which
introduced the MusicNet-powered RealOne Music service last month at
www.real.com. America Online has started a test run with MusicNet,
which it plans to add to its lineup of radio stations and artist
promotions.</TE>
<TE>   Streaming With Pressplay</TE>
<TE>   The initial version of Pressplay is heavily weighted toward
streaming, or playing songs upon request from an online jukebox. For
$9.95 a month, users can make 300 requests from the online jukebox
and download 30 songs. Other packages offer 500 streams and 50
downloads for $14.95, 750 streams and 75 downloads for $19.95 and
1,000 streams and 100 downloads for $24.95.</TE>
<TE>   Subscribers must use the Pressplay software, which is based on
Microsoft's Windows Media Player. It's easy to browse through the
collection by genre, search for specific artists, listen to records
recommended by Pressplay staff or flip through playlists shared by
other users.</TE>
<TE>   If your search comes up empty, the service often will recommend
similar artists whose music is available on Pressplay. Although the
service doesn't automatically provide information on the albums or
artists it provides, users can call up a review or a biography with a
click of the mouse. Those biographies also provide links to related
artists, with or without music on Pressplay.</TE>
<TE>   The streaming service, when used with a dial-up modem, is prone to
frequent interruptions of songs caused by Internet traffic jams. The
problem is less pronounced with a high-speed Internet line, although
pregnant pauses remain between each song. Streamed songs also don't
sound as good as downloaded songs because they are compressed more
aggressively, particularly when the subscriber is listening through a
dial-up modem.</TE>
<TE>   The software makes it fairly simple to create playlists of songs,
whether from the Pressplay jukebox, from songs already downloaded or
from a mixture of the two. In a mystifying twist, however, the
software won't let you mix Pressplay songs with music from any other
source--even your own CD collection.</TE>
<TE>   Subscribers who pay at least $14.95 a month can record some of the
songs they download each month. The limit is 20% of the limit on
downloading--in other words, someone paying $19.95 for 75 downloads
can burn a CD with 15 of those songs. The result is that subscribers
pay a bit more for an album's worth of songs than they would for a
new CD at the mall.</TE>
<TE>   Two catches: Not every song on the service can be downloaded, and
not every downloadable song can be burned.</TE>
<TE>   Pressplay has tried to make the service fun by adding interviews
with artists, message boards and a few goofy extras. Still, the
service gives subscribers little help in assembling all the tunes
they would like to hear, even though plenty of technology is
available to do that. For example, there is no automatic playlist
function to generate an hour of tunes based on a specific artist or
tempo. Nor can the service register a user's preferences and suggest
music to explore.</TE>
<TE>   Pressplay representatives promise that such improvements are
coming soon.</TE>
<TE>   Songs, Video on RealOne</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Pressplay, which is all about music, RealOne is designed to
be an amalgam of songs, video clips and multimedia goodies from the
Net. The software combines a digital jukebox with a Web browser and
video player, all of which can be used simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   The RealOne Music service lets subscribers play songs on demand or
download and keep them for 30 days on their Windows PCs. The service
comes in two tiers: $9.95 a month for 100 streams and 100 downloads,
or $14.95 for 150 streams and 150 downloads.</TE>
<TE>   Downloaded songs can be mixed with MP3s and other music files that
subscribers have on their computers. When it comes to listening to
tunes at your computer, RealOne music is indistinguishable from the
rest of your collection. Songs can be renewed easily after they
expire, with each renewal counting against the monthly limit on
downloads.</TE>
<TE>   The problems for RealOne begin as soon as you leave your computer,
where all your RealOne songs are confined. Unlike Pressplay, RealOne
does not let users duplicate their collections on a second computer,
so you can't enjoy your music both at home and at work. Nor is there
any CD burning or support for portable devices.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, the initial version of RealOne shares a basic
usability flaw with Pressplay: It's hard to make the most of your
allotment of streams and downloads, because RealOne gives little
direction in finding artists and songs that fit your tastes.</TE>
<TE>   The service offers no personalization, no software to recommend
music based on your likes and dislikes. And the online jukebox won't
play entire sets of songs, which would make it easier to sample a CD
or an artist's albums. Instead, it plays one song and waits for the
next request.</TE>
<TE>   Worse yet, if you search for an artist not on RealOne, the service
advises you to check your spelling. It should do what every other
on-demand service does: acknowledge that the catalog is incomplete
and point you to a similar artist whose music is available.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, yes--RealOne offers commercial-free radio stations, but the
service itself always opens with a video ad from one of Real's
sponsors. That's an unwelcome bonus for subscribers paying $9.95 or
more a month.</TE>
<TE>   Other Options</TE>
<TE>   There are few other on-demand music services, although several are
expected early next year. Among those available today:</TE>
<TE>   * Rhapsody. This combination of online jukebox and commercial-free
Internet radio from Listen.com offers subscribers access to two
catalogs of music on demand: about 17,500 tracks of classical music
from the Naxos labels and more than 22,000 songs from independent
rock, pop and hip-hop labels.</TE>
<TE>   The best part of Rhapsody is the free radio service, which offers
music in 17 genres, each with multiple subgenres. As songs play,
information about the artists and albums appears in the Rhapsody
browser, enabling listeners to follow links to other performers and
songs they might enjoy. One drawback on a dial-up connection, though,
is that the extra downloading can interrupt the music.</TE>
<TE>   For about $6 a month, Rhapsody also provides an on-demand service
that lets subscribers store songs in personal online jukeboxes.
Subscribers can search for music by artist, song or composer
(classical music only), or they can grab them as they are played on
one of Rhapsody's radio stations. Most songs from the nonclassical
stations can't be added to personal collections, however, because
Listen.com has not secured the rights.</TE>
<TE>   Listen.com has been negotiating with all the major labels, and it
expects to announce deals shortly that could help plug some of the
holes in its on-demand offerings.</TE>
<TE>   * Streamwaves. For $13.99 a month, subscribers can play as many
songs as they want from an online jukebox. This is a no-frills
service: You pick genres in the first column, artists in the second
column and songs in the third column, and your playlist appears in
the fourth column.</TE>
<TE>   You can't change the sequence of songs on the playlist, but you
can play them in random order. The service doesn't recommend
playlists or songs, and it suggests artists only when you use the
search function.</TE>
<TE>   The beauty of the service, at www.streamwaves.com, is that it does
what it does well--albeit with temperamental Web-based software. In
recent tests, buffering was quick and interruptions were rare, even
on a dial-up modem. The selection is limited to artists on EMI
labels, but it is wider than what EMI provides to RealOne or
Pressplay. You'll even find some Rolling Stones (but still no
Beatles).</TE>

<TE>   The Skinny</TE>
<TE>   Pressplay</TE>
<TE>   Price: $9.95 to $24.95 a month.</TE>
<TE>   The good: Downloaded songs don't expire, and a portion of the
downloads can be recorded onto CD.</TE>
<TE>   The bad: Many big-name acts are missing. Online jukebox performs
poorly over a dial-up connection. Relatively few downloads provided,
and the downloaded songs can't be mixed with songs from the
subscriber's collection. No support for portable devices or Macs.</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: Strictly for music lovers with high-speed connections
who spend a lot of time at the computer.</TE>
<TE>   MusicNet/RealOne Music</TE>
<TE>   Price: $9.95 to $14.95 a month.</TE>
<TE>   The good: Full-featured jukebox software with built-in Web
browser, automatically integrating RealOne downloads with other music
on subscriber's PC.</TE>
<TE>   The bad: Many big-name acts are missing. Downloads expire after 30
days and can't be moved to portable devices. Commercials run on
start-up. No Mac compatibility.</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: Good for people who want to refresh their PC's song
lineup with 100 new tunes every month, but not for those trying to
build their collection.</TE>

<LD>Spinning tops haven't changed all that much for a couple of thousand
years. A flick of the wrist and these children's toys will balance
upright for a couple of minutes until their energy is depleted and
they topple over.</LD>
<LD>   Now there's a top called Quark, which its manufacturer claims will
happily twirl for 15 minutes on a single twist, longer even than
those cool tops that spin while levitated in a magnetic field.</LD>
<LD>   Our test Quark ran for more than eight minutes, and we weren't
even very serious about it.</LD>
<TE>   For those who are serious, the Quark kit comes with a heavy top
with small pockets on the edge, small weights for the pockets to
perfectly balance the gizmo, a laser pointer to help you figure out
where to put the weights, a glass mirror to put the top on while it
goes through its paces and wooden shims to make sure the mirror is
completely level.</TE>
<TE>   The top is available in brass for $49.95, tungsten for $149.95,
and, for the geek who has everything, solid 14K gold for $2,495.
Check it out at the Micro Logic Web site, www.miclog com.</TE>

<HD>For Mature Eyes Only</HD>
<DH>The technical achievements of 'Grand Theft Auto III' are
overshadowed by the sadism that permeates the game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON CURTISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Grand Theft Auto III" embodies the best and worst of modern video
games.</LD>
<LD>   Taken purely in terms of play, the game for Sony PlayStation 2
delivers varied challenges across sprawling environments detailed
with painstaking care.</LD>
<LD>   But that's a little like admiring the cinematography of a snuff
film.</LD>
<TE>   Purists may argue that "It's just a game, man," but "GTA III" is a
game so suffused with sadism that its considerable technical
attributes are lost in a nihilistic realm that gives the finger to
any sense of propriety or responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   That a game like "GTA III" got made is not nearly as disturbing as
the fact that gamers who praise its "depth" and "variety" have made
it enormously popular.</TE>
<TE>   Or that a number of recognizable Hollywood actors--including Kyle
MacLachlan, Robert Loggia, Joe Pantoliano and Michael Rapaport--lent
their voices to its characters.</TE>
<TE>   Had designers considered even a tiny bit of mature self-censoring,
the game could have been an exquisite display of PS2's power and
refinement.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, "GTA III" does a disservice to the interactive
entertainment industry by playing into the hands of those who crusade
against violence in games without ever bothering to play them. Titles
such as "GTA III" hinder the industry's drive for mainstream
respect--something an $8-billion-plus industry surely deserves.</TE>
<TE>   Be forewarned: Its "Mature" rating doesn't begin to describe its
contents, or, by necessity, some of our descriptions below.</TE>
<TE>   The premise behind "GTA III" is simple enough. Players assume the
role of errand boy for the mob. Taking care of business--you know,
things like picking up the boss' girlfriend, whacking a pimp,
destroying evidence--requires a set of wheels. And there are plenty
of cars sitting around Liberty City just begging to be swiped,
whether they're occupied or not.</TE>
<TE>   Police cruisers. Ambulances. Family minivans. Hot rods. If someone
is inside, players pull them out, push them to the ground and slip
behind the wheel. Or shoot them. Or bludgeon them. Whatever it takes
to get the car.</TE>
<TE>   Once mobile, players speed through the streets of a fully realized
city, complete with three distinct boroughs. Liberty City sparkles
with virtual life. Pedestrians stroll the sidewalks. Other cars
cruise the streets. Over the course of two dozen or so missions,
players explore every corner of Liberty City--from suburban Shoreside
Vale to industrial Portland.</TE>
<TE>   It is impressive.</TE>
<TE>   As with other titles in the "GTA" series, much of the game is
spent driving. But unlike most driving games, "GTA III" imbues its
cars with personalities.</TE>
<TE>   When a car is jacked, the radio remains tuned to whatever station
the original driver had selected: talk radio, rock, hip-hop,
whatever. Players can then switch between them. It's a great detail.</TE>
<TE>   Missions range from a few minutes to a few hours. They are
challenging and varied and ooze with a Mafioso attitude. A player
might be wasting a reporter one minute and escorting an associate to
a meeting the next. In between are high-quality cut scenes voiced by
actors such as MacLachlan and Loggia.</TE>
<TE>   So what's the problem? After all, shows such as "The Sopranos"
deal with similar themes and win critical and public praise. Such
movies as "Pulp Fiction" dwell on violence and are deemed art.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a big difference between filmed entertainment and
interactive entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Like movies, video games are about fantasy. Unlike movies, video
games allow players to experience that fantasy firsthand by giving
them--not the director--control over their actions. Players who could
never fit their Frito-fed behinds into the cockpit of a real F-16 can
be the finest computer fighter jocks. Or those who long for more
chivalrous days can crawl through digital dungeons in search of
adventure.</TE>
<TE>   Violence and video games often have gone hand in hand, whether
it's the cartoonish Pooka-bashing of "Mario" or the double-barreled
grimness of "Max Payne." But "GTA III" takes random violence to new
soul-sapping degrees.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, players can revive their flagging health by picking
up a prostitute at one of the many street corners in Liberty City.
Take her to a secluded spot. Have sex with her. Money goes down.
Health goes up. The whole scenario is juvenile. A case could be made
that it's also demeaning and degrading.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not nearly as disgusting as what happens next. After
the hooker gets out of the car, the player can follow her, beat her
to death and take back his money. It's not just a quick hit. It's a
bloody bludgeoning with a baseball bat that players can feel in their
hands thanks to the force-feedback feature in the PS2 controller.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the game is rated "Mature" by the Entertainment
Software Ratings Board, which means it contains content inappropriate
for children under 17.</TE>

<HD>Doing Flips Over Adobe's Acrobat</HD>
<DH>Even on the small screen, this free viewer transfers copy
easily and legibly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK A. KELLNER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The personal computer--and by extension the personal digital
assistant--was supposed to free us from paper.</LD>
<LD>   Adobe's Acrobat portable document format, more commonly known as
PDF, converts paper documents into relatively small electronic files
that duplicate the printed product, complete with graphics and full,
faithful color.</LD>
<LD>   Adobe for years has offered free versions of the Acrobat Reader
software for PCs and Macs. Those with hand-held devices have had to
use third-party viewers, whose quality and flexibility have ranged
from minimal to acceptable.</LD>
<TE>   Now, Adobe offers a free viewer for Pocket PC, following up on the
introduction of a Palm version this year. Even if it weren't a free
download, the viewer is a Pocket PC must-have.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes of downloading and installing the software, I
transferred PDFs of two magazines and was able to read them with
ease. The small screen size of a Pocket PC means one has to make
allowances and adjustments, but the copy flowed well and was legible.</TE>
<TE>   The best documents that transfer to a hand-held device, Adobe
says, are PDF files that feature tagging, or cues to re-flow text and
graphics into the available screen area of the PDA.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the magazines I wanted to read, neither file (from
two different publishers) was tagged. Before each would transfer from
the PC to my hand-held, I had to let the program try its hand at
translating the file for the smaller screen.</TE>
<TE>   Adobe, which makes money on Acrobat in part by selling a $250
program that lets users create and annotate PDF files, urges those
designing for the small screen to follow its new conventions.</TE>
<TE>   One of the nice features of the Acrobat Reader is its ability to
zoom in and out on type. With the "zoom in" feature, I was able to
read just about anything in the file before me. But zooming--and
redrawing the screen--takes time, even on a rather powerful and
potent Pocket PC, such as the Hewlett-Packard Jornada used in this
test.</TE>
<TE>   About all that is missing from Acrobat Reader for Pocket PC is the
ability to fill in and digitally sign PDF-created forms, which is
something the desktop versions of Acrobat are noted for.</TE>
<TE>   Form filling on a hand-held device would seem a natural, given the
wide use of PDAs by mobile workers.</TE>
<TE>   An Adobe spokeswoman said the firm is hoping to introduce such
features in the future, but offered no timeline.</TE>

<HD>Lots of Room for Fun in 'Backyard'</HD>
<DH>The series adds basketball and 2002 football games with
virtual-child versions of sports greats. A variety of playing modes
entertain while teaching teamwork.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JINNY GUDMUNDSEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For sports-loving kids, there is no better series than "Backyard
Sports" software from Humongous Entertainment. New to the series are
"Backyard Basketball," in which players can match their skills
against young virtual versions of the likes of Kevin Garnett and Lisa
Leslie, and "Backyard Football 2002," which offers the chance to play
with computerized greats such as Terrell Davis and Brett Favre.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "Backyard Basketball"</LD>
<TE>   Hoopsters can suit up in their favorite pro team's colors to play
or coach three-on-three games against virtual neighborhood kids.
Young versions of Garnett and Leslie just happen to live in this
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The software offers children many modes of play. The quick-pickup
and single modes allow gamers to jump in and start shooting hoops
right away.</TE>
<TE>   The season mode is a longer-term commitment, with kid coaches
having to make numerous decisions about managing their teams as they
lead them through 18-game seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the players in the virtual neighborhood is gifted with his
or her own artificial intelligence and traits.</TE>
<TE>   Before drafting a team for a season, the coach can research each
player's talents by reviewing basketball cards that list statistics
on outside and inside shooting, ball handling, quickness and defense.
The coach also can create a team member by using the Customize a
Rookie option.</TE>
<TE>   After a team is formed, it's off to the virtual court, where the
coach chooses when and where a player gets into the action.</TE>
<TE>   To move the team member around, the coach clicks on the player and
then on the spot where he or she is to go. When playing against the
computer, the coach can choose among three levels of difficulty.</TE>
<TE>   The simulation helps children understand the game. It combines
realistic elements--the rules and strategies of the game--with
fantasy elements that include using special "power-ups" to perform
unbelievable plays.</TE>
<TE>   It's a fabulous way to teach the importance of teamwork, and the
teams always include a mixture of genders, races, sizes and shapes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Backyard Football 2002"</TE>
<TE>   An upgrade of the previously released "Backyard Football," this
game has a format similar to that of "Backyard Basketball." Not only
can kids become computer-chair quarterbacks, they also can select and
manage their gridiron teams.</TE>
<TE>   Options for play include single-game mode and playing a 14-game
season.</TE>
<TE>   As in "Backyard Basketball," kids select their neighborhood teams
after browsing through trading cards that list players' stats on
running, passing, blocking and tackling, catching and place-kicking.</TE>
<TE>   Once children select their teams, they proceed to the field for
5-on-5 action.</TE>
<TE>   As coaches, kids control the play of team members by
point-and-click. The coaches also call plays and decide the players'
positions. In an advanced mode, the coaches have the option of
creating their own plays.</TE>
<TE>   New to this version are tutorials that teach children how to run
plays, which lets them learn when to release the ball while passing
to a receiver running a specific pattern.</TE>
<TE>   Less-experienced coaches can get help by selecting the assistant
coach mode. When turned on, it offers help in making decisions and
highlights the best possible play for a situation.</TE>
<TE>   The software offers numerous options.</TE>
<TE>   Young children can skip through the decision-making and go right
into the action. Older children can spend weeks or even months
exploring the nuances of game play.</TE>
<TE>   The brilliant programming of "Backyard Football" makes it one of
the best children's games on the market.</TE>
<TE>   The matches can be played against others on the same computer or
over the Internet (PC only).</TE>

<HD>Expo Fuels the Apple Rumor Mill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM HEID</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you plan to attend the opening keynote address at the Macworld
Expo in San Francisco Monday morning, here's a tip: Don't drink a lot
of coffee beforehand. Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs is scheduled
to hold forth for at least two hours, and there has been no
announcement of a scheduled intermission.</LD>
<LD>   Nor have there been announcements of what Jobs will rhapsodize
about during his feature-length keynote. But as with every Macworld
Expo, there have been rumors galore. The buzz is that Jobs will do
far more than introduce a bunch of software vendors to demonstrate OS
X programs that aren't yet shipping--though he'll probably do that,
too.</LD>
<LD>   Topping the rumor charts is a redesigned iMac, one built around a
flat-panel display. This rumor raged last summer, too, but a new iMac
does seem increasingly likely. Sales of the bulbous computer are
down, and even fans of the iMac--including yours truly--think it's
due for an overhaul.</LD>
<TE>   What's more, according to a recent analyst report from Morgan
Stanley, Apple has placed a component order to receive 100,000
15-inch flat panel displays per month, with the first shipment due
this month. Flat-panel displays also are much cheaper than they were
last year, making them economically viable for home-oriented
machines.</TE>
<TE>   Some rumor mongers are predicting that the iMac family will
bifurcate, with the old design aimed at the under-$1,000 market and
the new model selling in the $1,200-to- $1,500 range. That doesn't
sound like Apple to me. In recent years, redesigned machines have
always completely replaced their predecessors.</TE>
<TE>   On the wild side, some rumors are predicting a new iMac with a
detachable flat-panel display that supports handwriting recognition.
Detach the display, and you'll be able to surf and write from the
comfort of your Barcalounger, the display communicating with the base
station through a wireless connection. It sounds dreamy--and
unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   In the upper limbs of the family tree, expect improvements to the
Power Mac line of pro-oriented desktop machines. We're likely to see
processor speeds break the 1-gigahertz mark (finally!) as well as a
faster internal architecture. Will we see Power Macs containing a new
PowerPC G5 chip?</TE>
<TE>   Possibly. Motorola has been working on the G4's successor. But it
also has been working on a faster version of the G4, code-named
Apollo, and any new Power Macs might contain this chip instead.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of what will power them, any new Power Macs probably
will contain a faster version of Apple's FireWire connection scheme.
Apple has been working on exactly this, and in September, it filed
for a trademark for the term "GigaWire." Thanks to a recent
collaboration between industry standards groups, the faster FireWire
might not even need wires for certain tasks. A wireless version of
FireWire would make possible blazingly fast wireless networking and
cable-free transfers to and from devices such as camcorders and
digital cameras.</TE>
<TE>   As for Apple's portables, the rumor mills are silent, and for good
reason. Both the iBook and the PowerBook G4 have seen improvements
recently, and significant enhancements are unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the digital hub--all those other Apple products whose
names begin with "i." Some observers are predicting an enhanced iPod
portable music player, one with twice the capacity of today's iPod or
with the bass and treble controls the current model lacks.</TE>
<TE>   Others speculate that Apple might release accessories for the
iPod, including a remote control for adjusting volume and skipping
songs. Many portable players include such remotes, and the iPod's
earphone jack appears to provide additional connectors that could
accommodate one. Other rumors are predicting an iPod aimed at the
Windows market and new software aimed at digital photography.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last year was grim for the PC business.</LD>
<LD>   Sales not only have stopped growing, they actually have
declined--an industry first. Although worldwide sales have fallen
4.8% this year, U.S. sales have dropped 11.2%, Gartner Inc. analyst
Charles Smulders said. Notebook PCs fared better than desktops, with
a 4.6% sales increase, but that's a fraction of notebooks' 26% growth
in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The economy bears some of the blame for lackluster PC sales. But
there's another reason. Most people who want a PC already have one.
And they don't have compelling reason to buy a new one.</LD>
<TE>   Face it, gone are the days of first-timers buying PCs so they too
might experience the joys of Web surfing, e-mail and word processing.
So, with first-time buyers in short supply, the market turns to folks
who might be inclined to upgrade or expand their systems.</TE>
<TE>   The PC business faces the same dilemma of any mature industry.</TE>
<TE>   When was the last time you bought a new refrigerator? Probably
when the old one broke. PCs rarely break. They do go through what
Smulders calls "end of life," which, in the business world, comes
when support costs get out of hand. On average, that's about 3.4
years for a desktop and 2.5 years for a notebook. Based on those
averages, Gartner projects 2002 PC sales to be flat in the U.S. and
to grow 4% worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Home PC users aren't compelled to buy replacement machines, which
cost as much as major appliances. Consumers, especially during
economic uncertainty, want to spend wisely. They are rightfully
reluctant to buy something new unless they know it will improve their
lives.</TE>
<TE>   For a long time, the PC industry marketed on the basis of speed
and power just as the auto industry once pushed cars on the basis of
horsepower and performance. Both industries still do that to some
extent, but most buyers are too savvy to spend money for speed they
don't need. There was a time PC buyers salivated when Intel came up
with a processor that was 30% faster than its predecessor.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Intel and AMD are even more aggressive. I was impressed when
Intel came out with a 2-gigahertz Pentium 4 in August only a year
after it introduced its 1-GHz chip, but rapid innovation doesn't
always translate into useful products. In the real world, PCs with
that 2-GHz Pentium aren't necessarily any better, faster or more
useful than their 1-GHz counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   Like car buyers, PC users want reliability, ease of use and
features that make the product more useful or more fun.</TE>
<TE>   There are some cool things that might not have been available or
affordable the last time most people bought a PC. Windows XP
certainly is an improvement. So are flat-panel displays and
recordable CD drives. But both can be added to existing systems. That
may explain why monitor sales were up 18% over Thanksgiving weekend
while PC sales were down nearly 9% compared with a year ago,
according to NPD Intellect.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of digital cameras and hand-held organizers--which are
almost always used with a computer--were up 40% and 31%,
respectively, a sign that people are seeking new ways to use their
PCs.</TE>
<TE>   The industry is starting to push home-video editing as a reason to
upgrade to a new system, but few people have the time or patience to
edit their own videos. In 2002, lots of machines will have drives
that write DVDs. There are still competing standards, and blank discs
are expensive.</TE>
<TE>   2002 should be the year PCs come out with USB 2.0, a better and
faster way to add external devices, and most new laptops probably
will have built-in wireless networking. These are good reasons to
think about replacing an aging machine, but none is the sort of
killer app that whips up a buying frenzy.</TE>

<HD>Ubiquitous Cameras Are Raising Concerns</HD>

<LD>Technology advances so quickly that the law can't keep up. For
instance, federal restrictions limit how audio recordings can be
made. It's illegal to tape other people's telephone conversations.
But no such restrictions exist for videotape. As a result, automated
cameras can tape pretty much anything, anywhere, anytime, as long as
the microphone is turned off.</LD>
<LD>   So jammed with electronic eyes is modern life that anybody walking
the four blocks from a little coffee shop near Spruce and Nassau in
Manhattan to meet somebody at the corner of Broadway and Fulton will
walk past at least 10 video cameras along the way. To take the same
trip without passing cameras would turn a four-block stroll into a
22-block marathon.</LD>
<LD>   This information comes from a Web site, www.appliedautonomy .com,
that culls a database of about 5,000 cameras around Manhattan. The
site is an exercise by groups concerned that all these cameras are
slowly and silently whittling away civil liberties.</LD>
<TE>   The cameras monitor activity in front of bank machines,
storefronts, apartment buildings and parks. Designed to thwart crime,
they also incidentally capture everything else that happens in their
field of vision. These cameras are installed to help catch criminals,
and that's usually what they're used for. Police routinely check
camera footage to place people at the scene of a crime, for example.
In that sense they provide a good and useful service that benefits
society.</TE>
<TE>   But there aren't any restrictions on how that footage can be used.
In Europe, a videotape called "Caught in the Act," consisting
entirely of legal but embarrassing moments captured on such cameras,
went on the market this year.</TE>
<TE>   Guards who watch the monitors that display pictures from an
elevator can make a copy of those tapes for their own amusement or
distribute them to the entire world via the Internet. IRS agents and
law enforcement officers have a clear set of laws that allow them to
be prosecuted for making your confidential information public. The
typical rent-a-cop has no such restrictions and, as the British tape
shows, no compunction about making a little extra money at the cost
of an average Joe's dignity."This situation has evolved without
anybody really paying attention to it," said Donna Lieberman,
executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. "Like many
intrusions on our civil liberties, surveillance has increased bit by
bit. At some point we may find ourselves living in a society where
our every move is documented on videotape, with half of us living our
lives and the other half watching them on TV."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. policies have prevented most government attempts at broad
surveillance. But no such restrictions exist for the private sector,
and that's why citizens have suddenly started living life as the
featured subjects in America's Creepiest Videos.</TE>
<TE>   The NYCLU started collecting data on cameras in Manhattan back in
1998. Today, that publicly accessible database contains the specific
location of about 5,000 cameras. Another group, the Institute for
Applied Autonomy, recently took that data and created the Web page
that plots a clear path.</TE>
<TE>   It's not perfect.</TE>
<TE>   The database only tracks cameras that can easily be seen by
outsiders. Those big bubbles on the corners of buildings, lenses
poking out of automatic teller machines and tiny red lights flashing
in a darkened corner are dead giveaways that there's a camera. But
the increasingly tiny and inexpensive devices now available guarantee
that many more cameras are out there that haven't been spotted and
added to the database.</TE>
<TE>   What does it matter if the average citizen is captured on them?</TE>
<TE>   "People visiting an abortion clinic, or attending a political
rally, or going to a house of worship, or reading a book in a park
are all participating in what we think of as public events, but all
those behaviors are offered privacy protection under the
Constitution," said privacy activist Robert Ellis Smith.</TE>
<TE>   "Being videotaped surreptitiously and having that information
stored and controlled by someone for their own reasons without any
influence by you over how it's used violates that expectation of
privacy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Privacy laws, such as the restrictions on audio taping, were
drafted when cameras were huge and expensive, according to Smith, who
publishes the monthly Privacy Journal. Few people ever expected that
cameras would become tiny enough to hide in a button, and cheap
enough that any good video game costs more than a cheap Web camera.
So the same lack of oversight that lets you set up a nanny-cam lets
other people tape you as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Do people have a right to know when they're on camera?" Lieberman
asked. "Should anybody be allowed to engage in surveillance when
there's no basis to suspect criminal behavior? These are fundamental
policy questions that the government needs to address."</TE>

<HD>Ever Think About Switching ISPs?</HD>

<AU>DAVE WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I just bought a computer running Microsoft's new XP
operating system and have been having problems with my America Online
service ever since.</LD>
<LD>   It seems that when you're running XP and log on to AOL you will be
prompted to upgrade to AOL version 7.0 from 6.0, which I am currently
using.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is that my computer keeps locking up at the "checking
password" phase of the log-on process with 7.0. My only recourse is
that, though the upgrade is mandatory, AOL lets you log on about
three times with version 6.0 (which works fine by the way, but AOL
says it and XP are not compatible).</LD>
<TE>   After the third time, you must upgrade or you cannot use AOL. I
then must uninstall and reinstall 6.0 so I can get three more log-ons
until I have to do it all over again.</TE>
<TE>   I have tried at least 15 times with AOL techs both online and on
the phone and they have had me try an array of "fixes" that don't fix
anything. Have you heard about any incompatibility issues between the
two systems and do you have a fix for me?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Both Microsoft and AOL have said that XP will work with
AOL 6.0. This is, of course, a lie. The friendly geeks at Q&amp;A labs
once again urge everyone to abandon America Online for a network
provider that uses standard Internet protocols and not some
proprietary system that slows everything down for all its users.</TE>
<TE>   There are thousands of Internet service providers in the United
States, and pretty much any one of them will give you more reliable,
cheaper, faster service than AOL. There are lots of Internet tools
that will help you find a local ISP. One is at thelist.internet.com.</TE>
<TE>   But, hey, you're probably stuck using that AOL e-mail address at
least in the short term. Try installing AOL 7.0 from any one of the
zillion CDs the company has distributed with the software on it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: I keep getting a screen message that says "WUCRTUPD. This
program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down. If
this persists please contact your vendor." Can you please tell me
what's happening?</TE>
<TE>   A: The wayward program is the Windows Critical Update Notification
tool. Once a day, it uses your Internet connection to check in with
the mother ship in Redmond, Wash., to see whether Microsoft has
released a new patch for its software. These patches are often
designed to fill gaping security holes, such as the recently revealed
problem with universal plug and play. Incidentally, if you haven't
already done so, visit Microsoft's Web site and download that patch,
because that hole really is serious.</TE>
<TE>   The easiest fix you can make is to simply remove the Windows
Critical ya-da ya-da. But then you'll have to make the effort to
regularly check for system patches using the Windows Update feature
manually.</TE>
<TE>   To remove the program, go to the Start button (lower left), then
Settings, and then open Control Panel. Double click Add/Remove
Programs, click on Microsoft Windows Critical Update Notification,
then hit the Add/Remove button and follow the instructions.</TE>

<HD>Oh, What a Tangled Web We Weave in Search of Rare Yarn</HD>
<DH>A skein or two of the Yamabiko blend, just enough to finish
a forgotten sweater, eventually is discovered on EBay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Knitting is apparently cool again.</LD>
<LD>   Hipsters in their 20s and 30s have taken up their needles in
search of relaxation and simple pleasures. They call it the "new
yoga." With this in mind, I made the following New Year's resolution:
Finish the sweater I started in 1997, when knitting was surely
considered uncool.</LD>
<LD>   I completed a little more than half of the back side before I
burned out. Although I saved 10 skeins of yarn, my greatest fear is
running out just as I'm about to finish the last sleeve. Without more
yarn, all my efforts would be for naught.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the shop where I bought it is out of business.
Instead of traipsing all over Southern California, I decided to stay
put and look for it online.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't think it would be easy, but it turns out my yarn is more
rare than I had imagined. It's a blend of wool, silk and mohair
angora called Yamabiko, and it's made by a Japanese company, Eisaku
Noro. A simple search on Yahoo (www.yahoo.com) led me to Noro's Web
site, which in turn directed me to its sole U.S. distributor,
Knitting Fever of Roosevelt, N.Y. None of the 17 yarns displayed at
www.knittingfever.com is Yamabiko. When I called, I was told that
Yamabiko had been discontinued.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, I reasoned, there must be a stray skein or two in a knit
shop or private stash somewhere in the world. If so, the Internet
would lead me to it.</TE>
<TE>   I began with the stores that Knitting Fever supplies. I typed in
my ZIP Code and received a list of stores in and around Los Angeles.
About one of three listings was linked to a Web site. None had
Yamabiko in stock.</TE>
<TE>   I went back to my original list of Yahoo results and found a bona
fide reference to my exact yarn on the impressively extensive Yarn
Review Index (people.ne .mediaone.net/kbsalazar/yindex.htm). The
review was rather tepid. But the bigger disappointment was that the
index couldn't direct me to a store.</TE>
<TE>   Next, I went to Google (www .google.com) and searched for
"Yamabiko." Most of the sites were in Japanese and a few were in
German, but none seemed to have anything to do with yarn. Adding
"yarn" to the search led me to Ewe-Nique Yarns of North St. Paul,
Minn. Its site (www.ewe-nique yarns.com) makes reference to a catalog
that includes Yamabiko yarn.</TE>
<TE>   I called the number on the Web site, left a message and crossed my
fingers.</TE>
<TE>   Then I decided it was time to seek out experts. A site called
Knitting on the Net (www.extremezone.com/~binky) led me to
Knitting.About.com, home to three online bulletin boards. The main
Knitting Forum is neatly divided into 10 categories such as
"Needles," "Help With Pattern Instructions" and "How Do I ...?"</TE>
<TE>   It took less than three minutes to sign up with About.com, which
entitled me to post a question. I wrote a succinct plea for any
skeins of my discontinued Yamabiko in the "About Yarn" section. It
took a day to get my first response, from a helpful woman named
Donna.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody was selling several bunches of Yamabiko on EBay last
week," she wrote. "Search the knitting section for 'Noro' and it
should come up if it's still active. If not, you can click 'Search'
and then 'Search Completed Items' to find the old auctions; maybe the
seller has more, or maybe they didn't sell the batches I saw. Good
luck."</TE>
<TE>   I went straight to EBay (www.ebay.com) and found 5,906 items up
for auction under the Knitting category. Of those, 37 were Noro
yarns, but none were Yamabiko. Donna was right: Someone sold 10
skeins of Yamabiko on Dec. 27, but it wasn't the color I need.</TE>
<TE>   Then I noticed another auction that ended Dec. 24 with the sale of
10 skeins of Yamabiko for $79. Amazingly, it was the exact color--and
even dye lot--I was seeking. I intended to send an e-mail to the
winning bidder offering to buy a few of the 10 skeins. Then I noticed
that the seller's write-up ended with, "I carry more of this yarn."
Off went the e-mail to seal the deal. I wrote to her, but she was
only willing to sell the yarn in blocks of 10--far more than I need.</TE>
<TE>   As I was contemplating my next move, the phone rang. It was
Juanita from Ewe-Nique Yarns calling to offer me the one skein of
Yamabiko she had. At $6.75, it was $1.75 cheaper than what I paid
five years ago. Even with $4 in shipping and handling charges, it was
well worth it.</TE>
<TE>   I may now have enough yarn, but I'll keep looking for one or two
more skeins--just to be safe.</TE>

<LD>For entertainment online, it's hard to beat urban legends, those wild
rumors (some of which turn out to be true) that spread quickly
worldwide in the digital age.</LD>
<LD>   The most complete listing of the legends that have been conveyed
on the Internet can be found at the Urban Legends Reference Pages
(www.snopes2.com).</LD>
<LD>   The Snopes site, named after the fictional family that appears in
several William Faulkner novels, is maintained by Barbara and David
Mikkelson as a hobby.</LD>
<TE>   It's where to turn after getting an e-mail proclaiming that
Nostradamus predicted the Sept. 11 attacks, that terrorists are
planning to bomb a mall on Halloween, or that famed novelist Gabriel
Garcia Marquez penned an essay about his pending demise.</TE>
<TE>   Other popular notions: Humphrey Bogart was as a toddler the model
for the Gerber baby, Susan Lucci is the daughter of Phyllis Diller,
and Pia Zadora was so terrible in a stage performance of "The Diary
of Anne Frank" that when the Nazis arrived in the house audience
members yelled, "She's in the attic!"</TE>
<TE>   All are false.</TE>
<TE>   Also, at least a couple of times a month, e-mails come in about a
supposedly missing or sick child--all of those also have turned out
to be hoaxes.</TE>
<TE>   It makes for good reading.</TE>
<TE>   The site is divided into several categories, including weddings,
films, television, war, science, love, religion and the ever-popular
Disney.</TE>
<TE>   No, Walt was not frozen. The "Aladdin" soundtrack does not call on
teenagers to "take off your clothes." And the look of Tinker Bell was
not based on Marilyn Monroe.</TE>
<TE>   But it is true that the original version of the 1977 film "The
Rescuers" contained a very fleeting image of a topless woman.</TE>
<TE>   And in 1946, the studio made an animated film titled "The Story of
Menstruation."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's a happy scene: pots brimming with rice, exuberant-looking
casseroles and the eager faces crowding around rustic tables. That's
the recently opened Barrio Fiesta in Lakewood--a branch, like its
sister outlet in Glendale, of a famous Manila restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   You'd never guess that the Lakewood building used to be a Mexican
restaurant; today the decor runs to wicker, wood, tinsel and exposed
ceiling ducts. Filipino pop music plays constantly on the sound
system. When you walk through the door, the first thing you catch
sight of is a grill man working massive hunks of pork and chicken
over glowing embers.</LD>
<LD>   The Philippines certainly have an island cuisine, shot through, as
it is, with overseas influences--Spanish, Chinese and even American.
The cuisine generally uses more grease than some people like, but
that's not much of a problem here. Many of the best dishes are
grilled, and the large, impressive menu uses many cooking styles.</LD>
<TE>   Before tackling it, try some of the specialty tropical fruit
drinks. Kalamansi, an island citrus fruit, makes something like a
lemon-lime drink with a unique flavor; it's one of the world's most
refreshing pick-me-ups. Guayabano, also known as soursop, gives a
rich, mild drink. The coconut juice at Barrio Fiesta is wonderful
too, thick with shreds of young coconut meat.</TE>
<TE>   Before the main dishes arrive, most diners will be nibbling on
crunchy bits of pork or chicken skin (chicharon bulalak or chicken
chicharon). One appetizer I can't resist is lumpia Shanghai, 20 tiny
fried egg rolls with a dense filling of minced pork. A sweet-and-sour
dipping sauce comes on the side. If you don't feel like eating
anything from the deep fryer, there are sariwang lumpia, vegetables
wrapped in egg roll skins, accompanied by a concentrated black soy
sauce.</TE>
<TE>   The unquestioned house specialty is crispy pata, meaty pig's
knuckles deep-fried crisp, golden brown, served with hefty knives
sticking out of them on wooden platters. This is one of the world's
defining fried pork dishes, and nobody in the area does a better
version than this.</TE>
<TE>   Jaded appetites might appreciate kare-kare, a stew of beef,
oxtail, tripe and vegetables submerged in a stiff, mustard-yellow
peanut gravy. It will come to the table in a clay pot, and you're
supposed to cut its richness with like amounts of white rice. It's
filling yet light on the palate--a seeming paradox. But with the
trip, it's an acquired taste.</TE>
<TE>   Those meats you saw grilling as you entered are all very good.
Inihaw na baboy is simply broiled pork chops, flavorful from a
terrific marinade and properly charred. Longganisa is a rustic pork
sausage blackened on a grill.</TE>
<TE>   The best beef dish is bulalo steak, beef shin and marrow served on
a sizzling plate.</TE>
<TE>   There are also plenty of seafood and vegetable dishes. Pla-pal sa
dahon is a tame dish of tilapia grilled with tomatoes and onions in
banana leaves. Sizzling gambas are deliciously spicy shrimp brought
to the table on a sizzling iron platter. Adobong talaba are stewed
oysters marinated in a vinegar- and sugar-based adobo sauce, which
tends to mask rather than enhance the natural juices.</TE>
<TE>   The vegetables tend either to be stir-fries, such as guisadong
betchules (basically Chinese long beans turned in a wok with some
chopped-up shrimp and pork), or eccentric stuff such as rellenong
talong, a fabulous omelet stuffed with spicy minced pork and just
enough eggplant to qualify it for the vegetable section of the menu.</TE>
<TE>   I wouldn't dream of eating here without ordering a side of garlic
fried rice (sinangag), or, if I were really hungry, adobo rice: white
rice fried with adobo sauce.</TE>
<TE>   The desserts include halayang ube, described as purple yam
pudding. It looks like dark purple Play-Doh and tastes to me like
potato starch. Sometimes, when the weather is hot, I hanker for
halo-halo, a sort of sundae of tropical fruits, red beans, agar-agar
and puffed rice, all crammed into a dish topped with ice cream. But
even the most timid palate will have no problem with leche flan, a
creamy caramel custard topped with young coconut (macapuno).</TE>

<LD>Warm and hearty, just what you want on a crisp winter day.</LD>
<LD>   Il Moro: This version of the classic Italian pasta e fagioli uses
Borlotti beans, chopped wide noodles, carrots, celery and onions.
After hours of cooking, it's pureed, drizzled with olive oil and
sprinkled with Parmesan. (Pasta e fagioli, $6.95.) Il Moro, 11400 W.
Olympic Blvd., West Los Angeles, (310) 575-3530.</LD>
<LD>   Parkway Grill: Here's a rich, slightly spicy soup of black beans
with tomatoes, red onions, cilantro and jalapenos, cooked until it's
nice and dense. It comes in a big bowl garnished with tomatillo salsa
and creme fraiche. (Black bean soup, $6.) Parkway Grill, 510 S.
Arroyo Parkway, Pasadena, (626) 795-1001.</LD>
<TE>   Urth Cafe: This simple vegetarian soup contains lentils, carrots,
parsley and onions, cooked until it's full-bodied but by no means
thick; it's just filling enough. It comes with a thick chunk of warm
sourdough bread. (Lentil soup, $3.95.) Urth Cafe, 8565 Melrose Ave.,
West Hollywood, (310)659-0628.</TE>
<TE>   Cafe Midi: In the back of the store Maison Midi, this charming
French cafe serves a revolving list of interesting soups. Bean soups
include pink lentil with cumin, black bean with chives and roasted
garlic and fava bean with smoky bacon. Relax on a pillowy banquette
with a bowl of soup and a slice of fresh ciabatta. (All soups,
$4.50.) Cafe Midi, 148 S. La Brea Ave., Los Angeles, (323) 939-9860.</TE>
<TE>   King's Fish House/King's Crab Lounge: The favorite soup here uses
white beans, carrots, tomatoes, onions, garlic, fish stock and, most
important, kippered salmon. The smoothness of the beans blends
beautifully with the salty, smoky salmon. Enjoy a cup or bowl with a
nice crunchy piece of sourdough bread. (White bean soup, cup $3.95,
bowl $5.95.) King's Fish House/King's Crab Lounge, 100 W. Broadway,
Long Beach, (562) 432-7463; 4798 Commons Way, Calabasas, (818)

W. Katella Ave., Orange, (714) 771-6655.</TE>
<TE>   Tulipano: In winter, there's usually a pasta e fagioli with
cannellini beans, tomato, celery, pasta and a little prosciutto or a
lentil soup that includes rice and homemade chicken stock. Ask for a
sprinkle of freshly grated Parmesan over the top. (Both soups, lunch
$4, dinner $4.50.) Tulipano, 530 S. Citrus Ave., Azusa, (626)
967-6670.</TE>

<HD>Struggling to Get a Footing</HD>
<DH>Teen dance club at Hollywood &amp; Highland tries way too hard
to be hip.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BLAKE HENNON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dim rooms, flashing lights and deafening bass are the marks of every
cut-and-paste club in the world. Hollywood's newest night spot has
all those but has replaced the requisite obnoxious drunk guys with
awkward teenagers.</LD>
<LD>   One Seven, newly opened at the Hollywood &amp; Highland complex, is
aching to be the premier destination for 15- to 20-year-olds seeking
a weekend groove and grind. The club marches under the banner of
Seventeen magazine, a move designed to attach a brand-name
familiarity but one that actually stigmatizes it as too commercial
and safe to be hip.</LD>
<LD>   And hip is what it's all about. On that litmus test, One Seven
comes out neutral.</LD>
<TE>   Though teens with fake IDs may opt for 18- or 21-and-older clubs,
One Seven's age cap is a blessing. Creepy old guys who haunt other
clubs--men who are exceedingly bad at playing the entertaining yet
difficult game "Is she 13 or 30?"--have no hope of being admitted.
Sadly, the age cap is one of the club's few advantages.</TE>
<TE>   In its bid to create an exciting and uniquely Hollywood dance club
experience, One Seven has avoided any real innovation and stuck to
re-creating dance club stereotypes. Some fake-ID-deprived kids
starving for loud beats, some lights and a dance floor may be drawn
to One Seven's banal just-like-the-movies decor.</TE>
<TE>   Guided by an "it's new to the young crowd" mantra, the club's look
is decorate-by-numbers sleek and posh. Oversized couches, cushions
and intimate booths line the walls. The dance floor is expansive and
ends before a stage that may occasionally hold a band but most often
serves as pedestal to selected dancers. (How the stage's dancers are
chosen is unclear, but Y chromosomes are apparently disqualified.)
Video spheres above the stage and projection screens flashing
unrelated images attempt to add to an unachieved sensory overload. A
dizzying light show and a standard issue thump-and-deafen sound
system complete the club's physical environment.</TE>
<TE>   Despite considerable effort, One Seven's atmosphere has a hard
time making the leap from decorating the walls to enveloping its
visitors. One week after a celebrity-draped opening, the club's dance
floor was half-empty during prime clubbing hours. The scene wasn't
pretty.</TE>
<TE>   Girls in standard-issue weekend uniforms of capri pants and
navel-baring tops danced while mouthing words to the latest Top 40
hits to their girlfriends. Meanwhile, pleasantly outnumbered but
still nervous boys perched on all available surfaces and watched.
Granted, this was its second night open to the public and the
management is still experimenting with different DJs and ideas, but
word-of-mouth from fickle teens may not give One Seven much time to
get things right.</TE>
<TE>   Some advice: What gets feet tapping while watching MTV doesn't get
things shaking on the floor. Club crowds demand nonstop bounce in
their beats. Though the opening party's DJ A.M. kept the floor
rollicking with mixes of classic party rock standards and modern pop
smashes, the next Friday's DJ Chris Monaco slowed things down too
often. Teenage clubgoers looking to get sweaty were subjected to high
school dance style slow numbers. Daft Punk and Britney Spears,
however tired their records may be, are more likely to incite hip
movement than Sixpence None the Richer.</TE>
<TE>   Though crowd members rolled eyes at some music choices ("Hey
Mickey"? Are you kidding?), their major source of discontent was the
high admission price.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is understood that One Seven will not enjoy the
alcohol sales that propel 21-and-over establishments, a $20 cover
charge and no parking validation is anathema to cash-strapped teens.
The cost is especially punishing if the DJ quality remains
unpredictable.</TE>
<TE>   One Seven promises a safe environment, but the results are uneven
and often stuffy. ID checks, dress codes and metal scanners suggest
security. But inside, kids find a bothersome, troublesome security
staff. Unspecific rules of conduct allow for selective enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Security guards kept closer watch on some groups than others and
arbitrarily warned some circles about "inappropriate dancing" for
moves that haven't been close to dirty since Jennifer Grey and
Patrick Swayze.</TE>
<TE>   One Seven--and the whole Hollywood &amp; Highland complex--are
promoting an image of Hollywood glamour. The club claims talent
scouts are on the prowl here, and the tales of starlet discovery are
engraved on the complex's tile floors. Here, they are suggesting,
even the as-yet-undiscovered can revel in the same hyper-cool hot
spots as the stars. As attractive as visitors might find that idea,
One Seven has not gone beyond approximating the look of cool to make
sure a top-rate dance club is still standing when the hype clears.</TE>
<TE>   One Seven, Hollywood &amp; Highland, 6801 Hollywood Blvd. Open Friday
and Saturday and before school holidays, from 8 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. $20
cover. (323) 461-1517.</TE>

<HD>Wanted: Experts to Help Assess Chief Parks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERWIN CHEMERINSKY</AU>
<BD>Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law professor at
USC, conducted an independent review of the LAPD Board of Inquiry's
report on the Rampart scandal for the Police Protective League.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the most important decisions facing Los Angeles in the coming
year is whether LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks should be given a second
five-year term when his current one expires in August. This decision
should be based on Parks' merits and not on political considerations.
To help accomplish this, the Police Commission should appoint a group
of independent experts to evaluate Parks and advise it as to whether
Parks deserves to be reappointed.</LD>
<LD>   Already, political pressures are beginning to mount on both sides.
In November, the Police Protective League--the police union and a key
political force in Los Angeles--issued a "report card" on Parks and
gave him failing grades. In response, several prominent African
American politicians, including Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles)
and City Councilman Nate Holden, held a news conference strongly
defending Parks.</LD>
<LD>   The league also plans to poll its members on whether they have
confidence in the chief. On the other side, influential business
leaders reportedly are mobilizing a lobbying effort on Parks' behalf,
after he told supporters that he would seek a second term.</LD>
<TE>   The decision whether to reappoint Parks should not be about which
group can muster the most influence with Mayor James K. Hahn and the
Police Commission he appointed. The sole question should be whether
Parks' performance in office has been of a sufficiently high quality
to warrant a second term.</TE>
<TE>   Without a doubt, there is substantial division within the city
about this question.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' supporters see him as a strong administrator, a tough
disciplinarian, a career officer who rose through the ranks and has
the experience needed to run the Los Angeles Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' detractors blame him for the low morale among officers and
for preventing a thorough investigation of the Rampart scandal.
Parks' critics believe that he is arbitrary when it comes to
disciplining officers, at times harshly punishing minor infractions
and at other times imposing minor sanctions for serious violations by
his command staff.</TE>
<TE>   A thorough, nonpartisan evaluation of Parks is thus essential. The
Los Angeles City Charter prescribes detailed procedures for the
reappointment of the chief of police. Parks has until Feb. 13, which
is 180 days before the expiration of his term, to formally apply to
the Police Commission for a second term.</TE>
<TE>   The commission then has until May 13 to decide whether to
reappoint Parks. Its decision, for or against Parks, can be
overturned by a two-thirds vote of the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   If the Police Commission does not act by May 13, the mayor has 30
days in which he can reappoint the chief. Such a decision also could
be overturned by a two-thirds vote of the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the Police Commission, the mayor and the City Council
all will be involved in evaluating Parks. All would benefit from an
independent, nonpolitical assessment.</TE>
<TE>   This group should be composed exclusively of individuals who have
expressed no position about Parks or his performance. Some members of
the group should be experts on policing from outside of Los Angeles.
The group should be as diverse as possible, reflecting a range of
viewpoints and experiences on police issues.</TE>
<TE>   There are many advantages to using such a process. Public
confidence in the LAPD would be enhanced if the decision about the
chief is seen as based on merit rather than on politics and back-room
lobbying. A neutral, expert evaluation might also lessen racial
divisions over the issue. Five years ago, when Mayor Richard Riordan
decided not to reappoint then-Chief Willie Williams, there was strong
opposition from the African American community.</TE>
<TE>   Further, using neutral evaluators would set a laudable precedent
as to how other key administrators in the city should be evaluated.
The new City Charter gives the mayor much greater authority to remove
general managers of departments, but it does not specify any
evaluation process.</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, this expert assessment would provide the best
guidance for the city as to whether Parks should stay as police
chief. The Police Commission should act immediately to create such an
evaluation team, but if it fails to do so, the mayor and the City
Council should insist on it.</TE>

<HD>Musharraf Is as Good as Gone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SIMON HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>Simon Henderson is a London-based adjunct scholar of
the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who has written
extensively on Pakistan's nuclear policy.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the tension between India and Pakistan appear to ease, the days of
Pakistani military dictator Gen. Pervez Musharraf as president are
probably numbered.</LD>
<LD>   Confronting India to liberate the Muslims of the divided state of
Kashmir is a basic ethos of the Pakistani army. Before Sept. 11,
supporting the Taliban had ensured that Pakistani rather than Indian
influence was dominant in Afghanistan. Since Musharraf is now tainted
with failure, his brother officers are almost certainly already
selecting his replacement from among their ranks.</LD>
<LD>   Unless Pakistan's current thinking can be changed, the next leader
has a single card to play and only a short window of opportunity in
which to play it. As the U.S. government knows but is careful not to
say, Pakistan's small arsenal of atomic bombs is superior in design
and efficiency to India's.</LD>
<TE>   Pakistan's Hiroshima-size bombs will work while India's might
perform disappointingly, as did the bomb it tested in 1998.
Furthermore, Pakistan's missiles work better than the Indian
equivalents.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan achieved this temporary advantage by, from India's
perspective, cheating. While India took pride in the largely
indigenous development of nuclear weapons and missiles, Pakistan
struck nuclear deals with China (India's regional rival) and arranged
missile sales from North Korea (probably just for money).</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf's logic was to raise tension and so force international
intervention in Kashmir, leading to a referendum among its people to
choose between Indian or Pakistani sovereignty. Confidently (perhaps
overconfidently) expecting Kashmiris to choose Pakistan would
strengthen the Islamic republic while deepening schisms in the Indian
confederation.</TE>
<TE>   If such tactics require encouraging Al Qaeda-linked Kashmiri
militant groups to carry out terrorist outrages in India--as in the
attack on the parliament in New Delhi on Dec. 13--then, from
Pakistan's point of view, this was legitimate.</TE>
<TE>   In tolerating the activities of the militant groups (perhaps even
knowing their plans), Musharraf seems to have completely misread the
messages he has received from the U.S. since Sept. 11. Although not
reported, CIA chief George Tenet was already lecturing the visiting
head of Pakistan's feared Inter-Services Intelligence on U.S.
exasperation with Islamabad's effective patronage of Osama bin Laden
before the jets crashed into the World Trade Center twin towers and
the Pentagon. Washington promptly organized another three days of
meetings to ram home the message, "Don't play with terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has limited policy options while U.S. troops are
still hunting down Bin Laden, Mullah Mohammed Omar and residual Al
Qaeda cells and needs Pakistan's help to do it. But having U.S.
military commanders now regularly visiting Pakistan will enable
Washington's message to be passed on directly to Pakistan's top
generals. British Prime Minister Tony Blair can say the same when he
visits the region.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the message should also be that Pakistan cannot afford to
engage in an arms race with India. Pakistan has a population of about
145 million compared with more than 1 billion Indians. India's gross
domestic product of $2.2 trillion is eight times that of Pakistan's,
and its industrial base is far more extensive. In such a race,
Pakistan is cast in the role of the Soviet Union, which was
bankrupted and forced into collapse in its effort to match U.S.
military spending.</TE>
<TE>   Washington also must restrain India's military posturing as the
immediate crisis abates. In coming months, both countries may feel
tempted to carry out more nuclear tests to iron out the glitches in
their arsenals, as well as to conduct more flight tests of missiles.
Beijing's assistance might be useful to the U.S.; two weeks ago
Musharraf went for talks with the Chinese leadership and seems to
have received less than a green light for his strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Is there anyone in the Pakistani leadership ready to recognize
reality?</TE>
<TE>   The post-Sept. 11 arrest, under U.S. insistence, of two retired
nuclear scientists--top experts in reprocessing plutonium who had
been meeting Bin Laden--shows the extent to which the country had
been playing with fire. Could U.S. pressure be applied for allowing
political parties--banned since Musharraf's 1999 coup--without
releasing the genie of anti-American street sentiment?</TE>
<TE>   In the short term, the U.S. may have to acquiesce to the emergence
of yet another military leader. Musharraf no longer has the standing
to offer concessions in the talks with India that he is seeking.
Combined with a more constructive policy on Kashmir by Indian Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, tensions could be eased, giving time
for the Afghanistan campaign to finish. India and Pakistan must be
persuaded that their conflict is not a zero-sum game.</TE>

<HD>Will NYC's New Mayor Talk Left/Govern Right?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York. E-mail: pinkerto@ix.netcom.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Remember all the talk of Bill Clinton running for mayor of New York
City? That didn't happen, but someone a lot like the 42nd president
just got sworn in as the 108th chief executive of the Big Apple. That
would be Michael Bloomberg, who seems eager to follow in Clinton's
New Democrat-ish path.</LD>
<LD>   Obviously Bloomberg and Clinton have unalike personalities. But
they share a basic pragmatism that leads them to look for
middle-ground "third way" solutions.</LD>
<LD>   Clinton, the original New Democrat, understood that it was the
economy, stupid. As governor of Arkansas and then as president, he
never let Old Democratic ideology about "social justice" get in the
way of jobs and profits. But at the same time, he was loose and
liberated about his own lifestyle and everyone else's. And he was
shrewd about throwing low-cost bones to Old Democrats on such issues
as affirmative action.</LD>
<TE>   The result was eight years of what magicians call misdirection:
Clinton's rhetoric was liberal, but the bottom line was conservative.
Indeed, during his presidency, the federal government's share of the
U.S. economy fell from 21% of gross domestic product to 18%.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg may not be as adroit as Clinton but he seems determined
to follow the same talk left/govern right model. His early mayoral
appointments have tilted toward liberal Democrats. His inaugural
ceremony Tuesday was an exercise in multiculturalism. And his actual
address--emphasizing diversity, inclusiveness and partnership--was a
distinct departure from the tough-talking, no-nonsensing "one city,
one standard" style of Rudy Giuliani.</TE>
<TE>   And yet Bloomberg has made it clear that his playing to the left
will extend to talking and outreaching but not to taxing and
spending. His pledge to cut his mayoral staff by 20% was a Clinton
gimmick--the former president pledged to cut the White House staff by
25%--but his opposition to tax increases seems real enough.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Bloomberg sounded almost Reaganesque when he said on the
steps of City Hall: "We cannot repeat the mistakes of the past. We
cannot drive people and business out of New York. We cannot raise
taxes. We will find another way." Such anti-tax talk, of course, is a
direct affront to the traditional liberalism of New York City. But
it's a reflection of the new sense of reality; the city is
vulnerable, not only to sudden terrorist attack but also to the slow
hemorrhage of jobs and investment to lower-tax locales.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Bloomberg did not plant his feet in anti-tax cement,
as did former President George "read my lips, no new taxes" Bush.
Jerry Skurnikof former Mayor Ed Koch's administration and now a
Democratic consultant observes, "There are many ways to raise
revenues without raising taxes--through fees, delaying previously
enacted tax cuts, and so on."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Skurnik takes the left-right mix of Bloomberg's policies
seriously: "He's pretty liberal on social issues, but he is a
businessman ....With New York City being especially hurt, he knows he
has to compete with New Jersey, Connecticut and the rest of the
country." In other words, Bloomberg's liberalism will likely to be
confined to low-cost gestures.</TE>
<TE>   But will it work for Mayor Bloomberg the way it worked for
President Clinton?</TE>
<TE>   Fred Siegel, a Brooklyn-based fellow at the Progressive Policy
Institute, was an early architect of Clinton's New Democratism. "But
what happens ... " Siegel asks, when Bloomberg's "nice words aren't
good enough anymore--when political claimants want real money?"</TE>
<TE>   Clinton was fiscally tight but verbally loose. Talk may be cheap
but the strategy worked--for two terms. Bloomberg lacks that natural
gift of gab, but since schmooze is the only new currency he's likely
to have, he'll have to learn to spread it far and wide.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In Times Square a few days ago, just after midnight on New Year's
Eve, Rudolph W. Giuliani passed the mayoralty of New York City to his
successor Michael Bloomberg. It was his final and arguably his
bravest showing.</LD>
<LD>   Giuliani and all the other lunatics who came out for the ball drop
stood there like arrogant sheep, smiling defiantly, as if this were
any other year, as if midtown at midnight on this particular day
weren't the plumpest of plum targets hanging mouth-wateringly low in
every suicide bomber's dreams.</LD>
<LD>   Mercifully, it wasn't to be. Our mayor dodged another disaster
only to pop up, as usual, somewhere else and say, "Next?" As if each
new debacle were just another customer.</LD>
<TE>   You have to have lived in New York City for the last eight years
to appreciate how absurd Giuliani's newfound god status really is,
and how utterly incongruent it is with his pre-Sept. 11 image.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, people saw him as a pint-size dictator whose only
ancillary virtue was that he cleaned up Times Square and made the
trains run on time. He was just a petty potentate, Napoleonically
short and short-tempered.</TE>
<TE>   This perception of the man can be neatly summed up by a T-shirt
you often saw for sale on the street. It pictured him grinning with
fangs and a Hitler mustache, with the caption "Adolf Giuliani."</TE>
<TE>   The man's tarring as a fascist was legendary. It followed him
everywhere. So much so that it became an inside joke among New
Yorkers, the kind you could share with waiters in restaurants who,
when you asked for water with your meal, sometimes asked you if you
wanted bottled water or tap water, which they drolly referred to as
"Giuliani water."</TE>
<TE>   Somehow "Bloomberg water" just doesn't have the same sardonic ring
to it.</TE>
<TE>   It was an indelible understanding we all had about our town's
chief executive, an accepted slur on his ethnicity that gave him a
whiff of Mussolini and made the NYPD out to be a marauding band of
black shirts, a bitter caricature that had been watered and groomed
to fruition by the tabloids.</TE>
<TE>   He was the worm in the Big Apple, or better, the serpent in the
garden, holding up that forbidden fruit, his city, to the highest
bidder. Never mind that the man had reduced crime to levels not seen
since the 1970s and had made the city thrive and blossom in a way no
one could deny.</TE>
<TE>   The seedy implications dogged him so thoroughly that no one
questioned the veracity of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima's claim
that the officers who beat and sodomized him with a broomstick in
their precinct bathroom in 1997 had exclaimed, "It's Giuliani time!"
while doing so. Later, Louima admitted to lying about this remark,
but the damage had been done, mostly because the remark's relevance
was a given.</TE>
<TE>   "Giuliani time," like "Giuliani water," had acquired a meaning and
an applicability all its own.</TE>
<TE>   Given all this, you can see, why those of us who knew Rudy
intimately before he became the most famous and beloved mayor in the
country are feeling as displaced as Rip Van Winkle to see him
plastered as "Person of the Year" on the cover of Time magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani beloved? Revered? Can it be?</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say he doesn't deserve the distinction. He
manifestly does.</TE>
<TE>   Striding through ground zero, having brushed off a bout with
prostate cancer, he outmaneuvered the towering infernos even as they
came down around him. By comparison, President Bush looked like a
cardboard cutout on the run.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani was built for conflict. He seemed always to be itching
for a fight that was big enough to challenge him, which is why, much
to his detriment, he came across as a bully and his opponents came
out smelling like rosy Lilliputians.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, on Sept. 11, the chemistry was right and he faced a
catastrophe that catered to his strengths. He didn't rise to the
occasion. It rose to him.</TE>
<TE>   His name went from mud to master of the universe in a single day,
and therein lies the story of what has to be the most stunning
popularity reversal in the history of American politics.</TE>

<LD>Reputed drug lord Miguel Caro Quintero is so cocky that back in 1997
he called a radio station in his hometown of Hermosillo, Mexico, to
refute the charges made against him by the chief of the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Agency. He gave his address and challenged authorities on
both sides of the border to come get him. Last month, at the request
of the U.S. government, agents from Mexico's attorney general's
office collared the man alleged to have inherited the infamous Sonora
cocaine and marijuana cartel from his jailed older brother.</LD>
<LD>   The arrest is the latest example of increased cooperation and
trust between Mexican and U.S. authorities and an encouraging sign of
progress in the effort to dismantle the criminal empires that flood
U.S. streets with life-sapping products while making Mexico corrupt
and increasingly violent. Now, the Justice Department should file the
formal request for extradition that will set in motion the legal
process to bring Caro Quintero north for trial.</LD>
<LD>   The Mexican Supreme Court cleared the way for this by ruling that
a Mexican national can be extradited as long as the sentence would
not be execution or life in prison. In Mexico, the maximum penalty
for a crime is 70 years, which should be plenty for Caro Quintero if
he is found guilty, given that he was born in 1963.</LD>
<TE>   The suspect is now in a high-security prison in Mexico City. If
all goes as authorities plan, this man who believed himself
invincible will face four federal drug and money-laundering
indictments in Arizona and Colorado and live out his life in an
American jail with people whose lives cocaine helped destroy.</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles Police Commission needs to break from its
counterproductive tradition of rubber-stamping the agendas of the
police chief, who is supposed to report to it and the mayor, who
appoints its members. Commission President Rick Caruso, appointed
last year by Mayor James K. Hahn, should be the one to make that
happen.</LD>
<LD>   The job of the part-time, unpaid commission is to provide
independent civilian oversight of the LAPD, a complex and highly
political behemoth with an annual budget of $1.2 billion. In most
cases, however, commissioners know only what the police chief wants
them to know, when he finally wants them to know it. This is in part
because the commission's inspector general faces hassles and delays
in getting the information to which the Los Angeles City Charter
entitles him.</LD>
<LD>   But even if the inspector general had full and unencumbered
access, it wouldn't spur the systemic change that's needed. And even
if the information were flowing freely, it would do little good
unless the commission grasped the implications. So Caruso was right
to ask for his own top policy analysts, paid for by the city, who
could penetrate what is essentially a closed organization with a
strong code of silence and a penchant for penalizing officers who
talk out of school.</LD>
<TE>   What the board really needs is someone like the late Jesse Brewer,
who spent nearly 40 years on the LAPD, rising to the number two
position before retiring in 1991, then joining the commission at
Mayor Tom Bradley's request. If today's commission can't have a
member with Brewer's expertise, it can at least hire analysts with
some semblance of the insight he brought to the job. Such savvy is
needed by anyone hoping to dig up the facts and interpret them for
commission members who may not know DNA evidence from doughnuts. Thus
informed, the commission would finally be in a position to make real
changes in the department.</TE>

<LD>When U.S. special envoy Anthony C. Zinni was yanked back from the
Middle East last month, civil life in the region seemed on the verge
of collapse. Palestinian suicide bombings and Israeli army attacks
had killed dozens of people, and Israeli military assaults inside
Palestinian territory were relentless. Now, only three weeks later,
the Bush administration is seizing on a reduction in the violence and
sending the retired Marine Corps general back to seek a cease-fire.</LD>
<LD>   The calm could deteriorate just as swiftly as it returned. Still,
one reason for comparative optimism is Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat's speech soon after Zinni's recall. Arafat,
often criticized by Israelis for preaching peace in English and war
in Arabic, demanded in an Arabic television address that Palestinians
halt all attacks on Israelis. In response, the terrorist group Hamas,
which claimed responsibility for several suicide bombings inside
Israel before and during Zinni's three weeks of meetings with Israeli
and Palestinian leaders, said it would stop attacks inside Israel.
Hamas did not promise to suspend attacks in the occupied territories,
and another major terrorist group, Islamic Jihad, has not renounced
attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the lessening of violence and Arafat's arrest of dozens of
Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants, as well as the closing of a number
of those groups' offices, have encouraged Washington sufficiently to
send Zinni back to meet with representatives of Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. The envoy could wind up shuttling
between the two leaders themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The United States was one of numerous countries demanding that
Arafat do more to crack down on the terrorist groups. Zinni should
encourage Arafat to keep up the pressure on the militants and arrest
those who Israel has demanded be taken into custody. If he doesn't,
Israel will try to make the arrests itself. The emissary should also
urge Israel to loosen its internal travel bans on Palestinians, which
have devastated the already weak Palestinian economy.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, whose government last month declared Arafat "irrelevant,"
decided he was important enough after all to bar from attending
Christmas Mass in Bethlehem. The ban gave the government a deserved
black eye around the world and, worse, negated an opportunity to
acknowledge that Arafat was doing what Israel demanded when he
arrested members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. This week Sharon blocked
Israel's president from proposing a cease-fire to the Palestinian
Legislative Council, apparently fearing it would be a public
relations win for Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Zinni's mission is tightly limited, which it should be. His goals
are a cease-fire after 14 months of renewed violence, more arrests of
Islamic militants and an easing of travel bans on Palestinians. Such
modest ambition increases the chances of success, although the
volatility and history of the Middle East call for caution. The
ultimate goal is a return to full-fledged peace talks as outlined
last year by the committee headed by former U.S. Sen. George J.
Mitchell. For now, it would be enough to back away from the brink.</TE>

<LD>Judging people by their appearance or ethnicity is a fuzzy, fickle
business, as several recent stories make clear.</LD>
<LD>   In Baltimore, an American Airlines pilot and airport police
vigorously questioned a man of Arab descent and--while they contend
race had nothing to do with the matter--ultimately removed him from a
flight to Texas. It turned out that the man was just who he said he
was: a Secret Service agent on his way to protect President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, when a man with a British passport and the
decidedly un-Arab name Richard C. Reid allegedly tried to ignite
shoes filled with plastic explosives on a Paris-to-Boston flight,
attendants called on a tall passenger named Kwame James for
help--apparently oblivious to the fact that he was engaged in an
activity that racial profilers would once have deemed suspicious:
Flying While Black.</LD>
<TE>   African Americans say they've noticed this phenomenon often since
Sept. 11. When a passenger became unruly on a Christmas Day flight
from Houston to LAX, for instance, the crew rushed up to a black
passenger and asked, "If we need you, will you help?"</TE>
<TE>   "I'm there," the man said without hesitation, no doubt marveling
at how quickly people turn from profiling one group as a possible
threat to looking to them as allies against whomever the latest

<SM>Who could blame a super-vigilant American Airlines pilot,
security staff and Baltimore airport police from vigorously
questioning an armed man of Arab descent who claimed to be a Secret
Service agent on his way to Texas to join President Bush's security
detail? Their suspicions were justified on that Christmas Day flight,
two days after a passenger tried to ignite a bomb in his shoes on an
American flight from Paris to Miami, but why didn't someone call the
Secret Service to confirm the agent's identity before putting him off
the plane?</SM>

<LD>The suggestion from Gregory Wright (letter, Dec. 29) that a solution
to graffiti is the dedication of public walls for "taggers and
graffiti artists" to display their works is naive, bleeding-heart
wishful thinking of the worst kind. As anyone who has studied this
issue will advise, those who do graffiti are bent on damaging someone
else's property by sneak attacks to salve their loser egos.</LD>
<LD>   If we were lucky, one out of 100 would be interested in artistic
displays. Catching them and immediately wiping out the malicious
property damage they impose is the only solution.</LD>

<LD>Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, asked if the Cuban government
will protest the U.S. military's plan to transfer Afghan POWs to the
U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay, says, "We don't anticipate any trouble
with Mr. Castro" (Dec. 28).</LD>
<LD>   Such haughtiness should not be allowed to cloud the fact that, for
nearly a century, Washington has held this piece of Cuban soil--first
as colonial master of the puppet government that leased it "in
perpetuity" in the aftermath of U.S. military intervention in the
Spanish-American War and, since 1959, expressly against the stated
wishes of the revolutionary government and the clear and unambiguous
sentiment of the Cuban people. Washington's "rental" checks since
then have remained uncashed.</LD>
<LD>   Guantanamo, along with Vieques in Puerto Rico, is one of the few
military bases maintained by a foreign power in another country
against the obvious will of its people. It remains in place thanks to
the standing threat of the use of massive, brute force to secure its
status as an occupying military garrison.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. should abandon Guantanamo, symbol of U.S. imperial
arrogance.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's movement of POWs there is nothing but a further
insult to--and provocative act against--a genuinely independent
nation whose people overwhelmingly oppose the war of its aggressive
northern neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   It is the continued U.S. bullying that will bring "trouble" to
Washington's doorstep, not "Mr. Castro," as Rumsfeld's coy remarks
suggest.</TE>

<LD>Jamie Court's Dec. 28 commentary, "Repair, Don't Merely Bandage,
Health Care," makes some important points. However, to believe that
high-quality, accessible health care, with all the latest technology,
can be provided without an ongoing increase in costs is unrealistic.
This is a fact that has been largely ignored by consumer rights
groups.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately there is a health care delivery model, pioneered here
in California, that has successfully addressed these problems for the
past 50 years. I refer to Kaiser Permanente, a nonprofit,
capitation-based, group-model HMO. It provides comprehensive,
integrated care and has important built-in quality-assurance
features. Kaiser physicians practice evidence-based medicine,
emphasize preventive health care and are committed to providing
accessible care at an affordable price. It may not always be perfect,
but having practiced with the group for 46 years (I'm now retired)
and having been active in the general medical community as well, I
believe it's the "best game in town."</LD>
<LD>   Instead of Kaiser-bashing, which Court and The Times are wont to
do, I would hope they'd acknowledge Kaiser Permanente's positive
features and commend its accomplishments.</LD>

<LD>Re "Israeli Activists Urge Army to Probe Civilian Slayings," Dec. 31:
In an article more suitable for the Hezbollah Web site than the front
page of The Times, Tracy Wilkinson takes a one-sided swipe at Israel.</LD>
<LD>   The article ignores the systematic campaign of terror waged
against Israelis over the past 15 months, in which countless babies,
children, men and women have been blown up, gunned down, bludgeoned,
maimed and stoned by Palestinian Arab terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   In response to this relentless assault on the very existence of
its citizens, the Israeli Defense Forces have taken strong measures
against the perpetrators of these heinous attacks. Tragically, some
Palestinian Arab civilians have suffered. In most instances, however,
these casualties have been accidental.</LD>
<TE>   The Palestinian Arab terrorists, on the other hand, deliberately
seek to kill and maim as many Israeli civilians as possible. One
would never know that, however, from reading Wilkinson's article.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Strapp</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wilkinson's piece detailing Israeli killings of Palestinian
civilians is a long-overdue expose of the violence with impunity that
characterizes Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The only silence in this excellent article is the voice of
Palestinian human rights activists themselves. Wilkinson quotes only
Israeli activists, ignoring the dozens of Palestinian nongovernmental
organizations that have been working around the clock to document the
deaths, injuries and house demolitions of the past 15 months.</TE>
<TE>   Having worked at two such organizations in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, I can testify that Palestinians are active and professional in
their efforts to claim their rights. Apparently it is only when
Israelis themselves criticize the Israeli army that anyone takes any
notice.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy Pearlman</TE>
<TE>   Cambridge, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your extraordinary article totally lacks context. The violence in
Israel, Judea, Samaria and Gaza is entirely due to the call for an
intifada by Yasser Arafat at a time when Israel offered the
Palestinians an extremely generous peace. He who lives by the sword
shall and should die by the sword. The Palestinians are hoping that
articles like this will cause America and Europe to come to their
rescue--as they have done in the past.</TE>
<TE>   However, since the Palestinians instigated the violence from which
they now suffer, they do not deserve any knights or any shining
armor.</TE>
<TE>   Gershon Hepner</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I eagerly await The Times' follow-up story on how Arafat "probes"
the deaths of innocent Israelis blown apart by Palestinian terrorists
virtually on a daily basis. But I guess since they are Israelis they
are not worthy of The Times' "unbiased" investigative reporting.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Making Waves in Malibu" and "'Lifelines' to Sea May Wither, Die,"
Dec. 30: The coastline from Topanga Canyon north to Zuma Beach and
beyond boasts few homes of architectural splendor. Many are stark,
white, overblown beach homes among the meandering border of weathered
wooden boxes, with the nooks and crannies of the canyons providing
noteworthy exceptions. These properties fetch millions for one reason
only: our public beaches.</LD>
<LD>   There are no true liberals in Malibu. They want no outsiders--in
this case, inner-city minorities--to obstruct their treasured
lifestyles. Issues pertaining to security, such as noise, litter,
urination and theft, exist the world over, and the residents of
Malibu are in need of a reality check to get in touch with the
recipients of those tax-deductible checks they've donated to their
pet causes. The checks they write to help the homeless, or perhaps
pediatric AIDS patients, are appreciated; however, are those
recipients welcome to "their backyard," which happens to be "our
backyard" as well?</LD>
<LD>   Rollin Dexter</LD>
<TE>   Toluca Lake</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your articles made it sound as if only liberals are interested in
opening beach access. Let me tell you, there are plenty of
conservatives who are hopping mad about beach access not being opened
to the public. The fact that this hasn't been done is just another
example of how this has to be the worst-run state in the country.</TE>
<TE>   How much could it possibly cost to maintain those access paths?
I'm willing to bet that one full-time person with a pickup truck, a
toolbox and a broom could maintain every path in Malibu. California,
with a $104-billion budget, can't afford that? Give me a break! Yet
here is California, waiting for a handout from nonprofit groups to
maintain those paths. If the handouts don't come, the alternative is
forfeiture of property worth millions of dollars and the public being
shut out from beaches forever. This is not acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Adams</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Palisades</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You quote Ellen Stern Harris (cited as the "mother" of the Coastal
Act) as saying, "I continue to pray for a tsunami, so we can get a
fresh start."</TE>
<TE>   Is the good "mother," as she seeks divine intervention and the
utilization of a destructive force of nature for her cause, asking
only for houses on the beach to be washed away or is she praying for
a total wipeout that will take the occupants with it? In either case,
it's a warm and heartfelt way to start a new year.</TE>
<TE>   Allan Manings</TE>
<TE>   Malibu</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As an alumnus of Pepperdine University--and consequently a former
Malibu resident--I have been troubled and saddened for years by the
existence of the town's private beaches. Now I am stunned to read
about the president of the exclusive La Costa Beach Homeowners Assn.
Jodi Siegler's fears concerning "safety, trash and sanitation on
beaches without lifeguards or public toilets."</TE>
<TE>   How can a woman who represents Eli Broad, David Geffen and Nancy
Daly Riordan complain about a lack of public services on the beaches
in Malibu? Any municipality that claims such citizens as these can
undoubtedly afford to pay lifeguards the going rate of $12 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Let's be honest--these people are being selfish, snobby and
elitist. I hope the Coastal Commission will enforce California's
coastal access law. The residents of Malibu will still be the
luckiest homeowners in Southern California.</TE>

<LD>If, as they say, night life is the best form of theater, then in
bars, clubs and restaurants the city offers every kind of production,
from the modern experimental to the operatic, from the
thrown-together to the total design experience.</LD>
<LD>   Not that they can all be found on some great white way; the city's
night-life theater is spread far and wide and caters to every taste,
so perhaps it's useful to get a sense of what you're in for
beforehand. After all, one man's cool temple of minimalism can be
another man's sensual-deprivation cell.</LD>
<LD>   In this famously exterior-led city, where what you see on the
outside is not necessarily what you get on the inside, your choice of
night life can come down to the look of your surroundings. L.A.'s
architecture tends to be associated in the world's imagination with
clear lines, simple, bare modernism and conceptuality. The last few
years, however, have seen a growing variation in the uses of building
style, and nowhere is this more apparent than in some of the more
recent arrivals on the night-life scene.</LD>
<TE>   More than with public buildings or even perhaps galleries and
theaters, the architectural design of the places in which we choose
to drink, eat and dance are barometers of ideas of style, tastes and
even our aspirations. Their appeal has to be immediate, but the ones
that prove to have staying power--and those we look at here either
have shown it or look set to--will be picked over and emulated by
those looking for the next successful formula.</TE>
<TE>   The latest in design trends often emanates from the gay world, so
it's fitting that we start with here, a gay cocktail lounge in the
heart of boys' town, on the corner of Santa Monica and Robertson
boulevards. Opened in a brief ceremony in December by West Hollywood
Mayor John Heilman, here is a great example of the new type of gay
venue--that is, there's nothing on the surface that is especially
"gay" about it. Immaculate, uncluttered to the point of sparse and
devoid of kitsch or camp references, it was designed for owner Pat
Rogers and his partners by New York architect James Bartholomew, who
was responsible for the enormously popular G lounge in Chelsea.</TE>
<TE>   In its attempt to create an elegantly modern atmosphere that would
attract a style-conscious, affluent crowd, here takes no prisoners.
Ambience is all-important, says Bartholomew. "We wanted it to be
modern but also warm and inviting." The bar is a 4,000-square-foot
L-shape of concrete floors: A long "runway," which in other
circumstances would make a great catwalk, leads to a staircase that
opens up onto the main room, which is dominated by the rectangular,
glistening main bar (another, smaller one greets customers at the
entrance). A continuous wall seat, low tables and square, brown,
squat leather stalls stand in a waist-high line down the side of the
runway, giving patrons the chance to view (from the most intimate
viewpoint) the comings and goings. Large floor-to-ceiling windows
framed in aluminum look out onto a tree-filled patio and the street.
It's an indication of how far we've moved beyond the days when gay
meeting places were hidden from view, or shrouded in back-street
darkness, that here proclaims itself to the outside world as being
integrated into the main street life.</TE>
<TE>   Its cold, almost Roman classicism would have to be lighted
carefully to set the right mood, so lighting supremo Ken Billington
was brought in. "We didn't want it to look dark--we wanted it to look
bright and cheery," says Billington, a veteran of more than 80 shows,
including 22 Radio City Christmas spectaculars, who won a Tony for
his lighting of "Chicago." He's used to using theatrical tricks to
make those on stage look their best. "Bars are a form of theater, a
place to see people and be seen. We used a sophisticated control
system and warm tones to bring out the brick and tan of the
interior."</TE>
<TE>   The effect is certainly a complete one--you feel as if you are
walking into something that has been set up to match what you, as a
sophisticated urban gay man, would apparently want from a bar. During
my visits, the crowd--heaviest on weekends--featured a fair number of
the most chiseled and buffed of the WeHo crowd, whose immaculate
white T-shirts and designer leather jackets match the unadorned and
masculine interior, and whose angular jawlines compete with the
fixtures and fittings for sheer cut-glass squareness.</TE>
<TE>   One feels that for many of the crowd, here looks like their idea
of a dream apartment, the spiritual sister of the new Casa Armani
farther down Robertson. It's brilliant to take center stage in and
pose, but if you're looking for somewhere to hide, forget it, because
there are virtually no nooks or crannies in these streamlined,
somewhat daunting rooms. Whether you will feel at home in such a cool
interior depends on how warmblooded a creature you are; the crowd
there seemed to be in its element, but the cheeriness was lost on me,
and I swear that there were a few moments when I saw my own breath.</TE>
<TE>   Gay or straight, L.A. night life is for the most part dressed
casual, albeit a painstakingly applied, terribly expensive (and in
the case of here, a somewhat serious) casualness. But there are
pockets of atypical, more formal glamour, where wearing a suit and
tie or--heaven forbid, a fur--won't get you thrown out. Those in
search of this should make their way south to Beverly Hills and
Reign, the restaurant and bar created a couple of years ago by
football player Keyshawn Johnson. The elegance of the diners--the
place is a favorite among the successful and affluent black
community--is a direct response to and reflection of the subtly
created, cathedral-like design of the 9,000-square-foot interior. And
this is anything but chilly.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to create it from scratch," says architect Robert
Thibodeau. "Before we started, it was a dive--too grim, too gothic
for a restaurant. It had something of a cold karma." In its place he
created a restaurant that, while not breaking any design barriers,
manages to be modern in sensibility and yet have an up-market,
traditional, aspirational feel.</TE>
<TE>   Thibodeau put in a mezzanine floor, which also acts as a gallery
to look down at the diners below, separated from the massive bar by a
screen. With the restaurant drenched in light maple wood on its
floors and paneling (and thankfully no sign of concrete), the
colorful dishes being served are thrown into sharp relief. The main
room has the feel of a gallery, and the bright lighting, white linen
tablecloths and subdued expensiveness make you want to walk more
elegantly and talk more wittily. Food alone can't do that; it's the
sense of occasion in the architecture that makes you want to rise to
it. Reign has a more intimate VIP room at the back, which, decorated
with contemporary paintings, houses live jazz on Saturday nights. The
perfect evening for some: bar, dinner, jazz, people-watching, great
surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   If Reign seems too grown-up for you, then on Santa Monica
Boulevard, east of La Cienega, is Felt, another gay bar that has been
there for more than a year and that in many respects is a more
feminine version of here; Tuesday's Girl's Night is one of the bar's
most popular. Designed by Sophie Harvey and Ralph Gentile, it's
described as having a "New York Chic/L.A. Cozy" ambience, which
roughly translated means, again, a simple, minimal interior with
virtually no extraneous decoration.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a constant complaint that there seemed to be nowhere
decent-looking or designed in that neighborhood," says Harvey. The
space was empty--it had been a restaurant called Capone's in a
previous incarnation--and the two were working on a small budget.</TE>
<TE>   It certainly has a Manhattan feel to it; as for cozy--well, that
may be stretching it a bit, but it's certainly less chilly than here,
which may be due to the fact that it is also a popular restaurant,
with tables and booths on both sides of the room. But as with here,
it's also about being seen: The huge central bar is visible from the
street, and just to emphasize the point, the side of it which one
sees through the windows has been kept clear of stalls, so that
passersby will be able to check out the perfectly rounded rear ends
of those propping it up and nursing cocktails.</TE>
<TE>   Felt by name, felt by nature--the material was used by Harvey and
Gentile as much as possible in the large, high-ceilinged room. "We
used felt on the light fixtures, the columns, the bar and on the
backs of all the booths," says Harvey. "This is about style, and we
didn't want it to be cold." It's certainly less self-conscious than
here, which could be put down to the kitchen being visible--through a
door at the back--and the fact that it's had longer to, so to speak,
settle. However what both places could do with would be a little
spontaneity--not something easy to achieve using the modernist
architectural lexicon.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. club life has received something of a bad rap in recent
years; when asked by out-of-towners where the hot places are, nothing
would immediately spring to mind. But this year has seen a huge
improvement, what with the arrival of Jeff Gossett's stylish Moomba
(again in West Hollywood) and the full-scale reinvigoration of
Hollywood. Much has been made of the architectural merits or
otherwise of the new Hollywood &amp; Highland development; it's farther
along Hollywood Boulevard where perhaps the more interesting things
have been happening. Clubs such as Beauty Bar and Star Shoes, and
Chris Breed's lavishly restored Pig n' Whistle have been packing them
in. And in June, Breed plans to open another restaurant and bar,
White Lotus, in the building which currently houses the Crush Club on
Cahuenga Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   But the club that seems to have made the most impact in what was
hitherto the wasteland of Hollywood stands on the site of the old
Brown Derby, at Hollywood and Vine. Deep couldn't be further from
here or Felt in terms of design and tone. Manager Ivan Kane worked
with designer Fred Sutherland to create a venue that would emphasize
elements of decadence, sexuality and voyeurism.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything in the club is designed to be sexy and lived-in, not
cold and sterile," says Kane. "We wanted no posturing, no
table-hopping--in fact, we didn't want to create the typical L.A.
place. We wanted a sexually charged energy."</TE>
<TE>   It's interesting that this fear of coldness comes up time and
again when discussing L.A.'s nighttime venues. Perhaps it's an
implicit recognition that for all its attention to matters of the
body, L.A. lacks the sensuality of other, less modern cities.
Sensuality requires a certain amount of humor and fun, and it's
difficult to create that in a town where you can live or die by your
physical appearance. So it's a real achievement for Deep that it's
managed to create an atmosphere of playfulness by using wit and an
almost homespun approach to decoration.</TE>
<TE>   By the standards of many such enterprises, Deep's 5,000 square
feet were redesigned on a tiny budget. It can be seen as proof that
the "everything-in-its-place-and-a-place-for-everything" total design
experience isn't a prerequisite for a successful nightspot. The
existing room was divided by new walls, and where possible, materials
from the building were reused. Nine-foot ceilings were knocked out,
and columns were embellished with old wooden decorative covers found
by Sutherland, who's not a trained architect but who has years of
experience in clubland. Hanging chandeliers, a fake wrought-iron
gateway in the front inside patio, and a fierce stuffed lion looming
over the entrance to the main room all give the place an elegantly
wasted, operatic feel. The booths, chairs and tables eschew leather
for tan vinyl. Hanging over the bar at center is a '50s painting of a
coyly sexy chick with a come-hither look, which was found in the old
building. Slightly less coy are the dancers who are housed in
brightly painted rooms behind the huge gilt mirrors; we can see them,
but they can't see us.</TE>
<TE>   Dropped into the middle is the dance floor, which is effectively a
glass and aluminum box, lined by old airport runway lights. Although
above it one can look up and watch more professional dancers--"some
of L.A.'s finest" says Kane--writhing about and enjoying each other,
the dance floor has a retro feel, an atmosphere which is continued in
the smaller back bar; its cool-psychedelic walls could have come
straight out of a '70s blaxploitation movie. The club's two-way
mirrors and uninhibited use of interesting little details, such as
figurines over the bar and nude magazine collages on the restroom
walls provide something to look at wherever the eye alights.</TE>
<TE>   So far as its crowd is concerned, Deep has a "tight rope"--beauty,
fame or other eye-catching distinction is preferred. There are three
VIP rooms at the back, converted walk-in fridges that have a more
louche, naughty-but-nice atmosphere. The club pulls
celebrities--Christina Aguilera hired it out in December for her 21st
birthday, and Brad Pitt filmed here for one of the scenes in "Ocean's
Eleven." But its success, like other venues I've looked at, rests on
the lesser mortals, and in its slightly ramshackle way, the club has
managed to successfully create an atmosphere of sophisticated,
sensual fun. I certainly saw people having a good time; I even sensed
(gosh!) elusive spontaneity. In the shallow world of clubs, Deep is
it.</TE>

<LD>Sex and night life go together like J. Lo and Daisy Dukes: They're an
ideal fit. When a nightclub's design principals are aimed to
stimulate the libido, you can bet there's a line outside and a
doorman getting tips--the main objectives of most clubs. For a sexy,
sumptuous taste of postmodern L.A., look no farther than the
following hot spots:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   A.D. (836 N. Highland Ave., Hollywood, [323] 460-6630). There are
dungeons, ruins and a bit of monastic monkey business. Is it getting
hot in here, or is that just Barbarella getting whipped in the
prison?</LD>
<TE>   Bar Marmont (8171 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, [323] 650-0575).
There's magic at Bar Marmont, plain and simple. What looks like a
trashy exterior from afar is brilliant upon closer scrutiny--an
Asia-meets-South Pacific squeeze of whimsical elegance.</TE>
<TE>   Belly (7929 Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood, [323] 692-1068).
Visualize how it would feel to be inside "Jeannie's" crib. Now, add
too-cute industry players and a clever tapas menu and you've got
Belly, a favorite setting for creating tummy butterflies.</TE>
<TE>   Conga Room (5364 Wilshire Blvd., L.A., [323] 938-1696). Propelled
by its extreme colors and wildly tropical sensibilities, the Conga
Room is as close to a sexy Miami nightclub as you'll find in L.A.
It's loud, proud and all fired up.</TE>
<TE>   Deep (1707 N. Vine St., Hollywood, [323] 462-1144). Banking on
Hollywood's insatiable appetite for skimpy clothing and dance floor
"bump 'n' grind," Deep smartly combines the two. Skimpily clothed
dancers bump 'n' grind in glass cases, strategically located
throughout Deep's Euro-trash glam environs. Say "cheese."</TE>
<TE>   Garden of Eden (7080 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, [323] 465-3336).
This naughty nightclub emerged a few years back with a
she-devil-may-care attitude, merging Casablanca-era glamour with
overt sexual design. Think female anatomy as dance floor sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   Key Club (9039 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, [310] 274-5800). The
Sunset Strip music joint banked on rock's big comeback by opting for
a very "metal" design. Now that rock 'n' roll is sexy again, the
metallic Key Club's the place with an appetite for destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Lucky Duck (672. S. La Brea Ave., L.A., [323] 931-9660). The
sexiest thing about Lucky Duck is its understated elegance. Wherever
you look in the new Chinese bistro, things seem perfectly in balance.
Its winning merger of retro sensibilities and sublime modernism make
it simply ducky.</TE>

<TE>   "The School for Wives" was Moliere's breakthrough hit comedy in
1662. South Coast Repertory is updating it to the 19th century and
using a translation, faithful to the original French rhymed couplet
form, that was the basis for a hit production in London in 1997. The
action centers on Arnolphe, a wealthy middle-aged burgher who
believes cuckoldry is the ultimate disgrace for a man. To avoid that
fate, he has handpicked a bride-to-be, Agnes, and brought her up from
age 4, schooling her to be a bland simpleton on the supposition that
she will lack the imagination to cheat on him. To Arnolphe's
surprise, he falls deeply in love with the girl; but to his chagrin,
she proves to be more resourceful than he could have thought.</TE>
<TE>   "The School for Wives," South Coast Repertory, 655 Town Center
Drive, Costa Mesa. Tuesdays-Fridays, 8 p.m., Saturdays, 2:30 and 8
p.m., Sundays, 2:30 and 7:30 p.m. Previews through Jan. 10; regular

<TE>   Frequently called the actor of his generation and certainly the
most explosive, Sean Penn remains as well-known for his short
marriage to Madonna and his pugilistic attitude toward paparazzi as
he is for his cinematic work. With "Spontaneous Combustion: A Tribute
to Sean Penn," the American Cinematheque spotlights the actor-
director's fiery talents in front of and behind the camera.
Highlights include Saturday's double feature of Penn's 1991

<LD>   "Copenhagen"--Did a mysterious 1941 meeting in Copenhagen between
two Nobel Prize-winning physicists affect the outcome, nuclear and
otherwise, of the 20th century? Michael Frayn's eloquent, carefully
wrought "Copenhagen" is about that meeting between Niels Bohr, a
methodical Dane, and his brash colleague and friend Werner
Heisenberg, the German behind the "uncertainty principle" of particle
physics. Rather than flatfooting his way down the path of docudrama,
laying out a single version of events, Frayn revels in multiple
possibilities, various what-ifs and scenarios.... It's a ghost story,
a science seminar and, movingly (though not melodramatically), an
investigation of conscience.</LD>

<LD>   Humphrey Bogart stars as two of the most celebrated private
eyes--Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade--in a double feature at the New
Beverly. Director Howard Hawks' adaptation of Raymond Chandler's
hard-boiled Marlowe crime novel "The Big Sleep" is a great, taut
memento of the '40s--ribald and dangerous, racy and smart. Bogey also
shines as the cynical Spade in "The Maltese Falcon." Dashiell
Hammett's superb thriller, paradigm of the whole private-eye genre,
was John Huston's classy directorial debut. Better movie literary
adaptations than this are rarer than the bird itself.</LD>

<TE>   "Copenhagen," Michael Frayn's Tony Award-winning drama about the
race to split the atom during World WarII, is one of a small wave of
plays and movies drawing attention for sophisticated treatments of
science and mathematics. The fact-based but speculative play probes
the scientific questions, the interpersonal dynamics and the
historical repercussions of one of the war's enigmas: the 1941 visit
by Werner Heisenberg, head of Nazi Germany's nuclear research
program, to his half-Jewish Danish mentor and fellow Nobel laureate
in physics, Niels Bohr. This is a different production from the
"Copenhagen" with Len Cariou and Mariette Hartley that ends its run
this weekend at the Wilshire Theatre in Los Angeles.</TE>

<TE>   He who lives by the sword, dies by the yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.
What's really cool about Akira Kurosawa's 1954 classic "The Seven
Samurai" is its relationship to the American western--both those that
came before and those after. Though set in feudal Japan, Kurosawa
borrowed heavily from John Ford, setting his epic in vast untamed
expanses and populating his tale with the good, the bad and those who
patrol the median. Seven samurai--including actors Toshira Mifune and
Takashi Shimura--are petitioned by a village of impoverished farmers
to protect them from the yearly ravages of the roaming brigands. A
small war follows, in which only a handful survive. Furious and
savagely exciting, it's one of the screen's superlative adventure
epics.</TE>

<HD>At Orange County Venues, Distinctive Style Is Built-In</HD>

<LD>Over the last 10 years, Orange County's clubs have debuted some of
the nation's most popular rock bands. But there's more to a club than
just the music. Some people go specifically to see the
architecture--the colors, lights and decorations that give the
guitars and drums that perfect ambience. Below are some of Orange
County's most distinguished venues.</LD>
<LD>   In terms of design, there's no grander club in Orange County than
PJ's Abbey, which was established as a church in 1891 and now hosts
music and comedy shows. The main dining room features original
stained-glass windows that hold more than 100 years of religious
history, while the walls of the Almond Room have angel sculptures
watching over the customers. PJ's Abbey, 182 S. Orange St., Orange,
(714) 771-8556.</LD>
<LD>   For a true hybrid of steel and style, there's the Shark Club in
Costa Mesa. Once a boat-manufacturing company, this nightclub
describes its look as "industrial renaissance"--part wood and
concrete, with exposed pipes along the walls and ceiling, and part
classic European, with paintings and gold-leaf frames. There are two
dance floors, many pool tables and a 2,000-gallon aquarium. Shark
Club, 841 Bristol St., Costa Mesa, (714) 751-6428.</LD>
<TE>   With the release of the "Lord of the Rings" movie, Elfstone Hollow
in Huntington Beach might be increasingly in demand. This tiny
English-style pub is cloaked in Tolkien style, with an all-wood
interior and plants hanging from the ceiling beams. In addition, the
walls sport paintings of fairies and sculptures of hobbits, dragons,
unicorns and more. Elfstone Hollow, 7561 Center Ave., Huntington
Beach, (714) 899-9918.</TE>
<TE>   From its name, you might suspect Detroit Bar to be a rugged
industrial dive--but the former Club Mesa has an earthy,
postmodernist look, with an orange-and-green color scheme and a
late-'60s-style bar. The bar area-- with booths, pool tables and a
back lounge-- accommodates 230 people. Detroit Bar, 843 W. 19th St.,
Costa Mesa, (949) 642-0600.</TE>
<TE>   On the raw side is the Doll Hut, which peers up from between
warehouses in Anaheim's factory district. The club, which covers only
1,000 square feet, has a 10-foot ceiling and stickers all over the
walls. With the bar taking up much of the floor space, you can get
close to the music--there is no stage, and the bands play in the
corner. Doll Hut, 107 S. Adams Ave., Anaheim, (714) 533-1286.</TE>

<HD>Love-In for Late Singer of Betty Blowtorch</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>L.A.'s rock 'n' roll community pulled together on New Year's Eve to
celebrate the life of Betty Blowtorch's Bianca Halstead, and, truly,
love is an amazing thing. Her family was in the house as the Whisky
paid tribute to Halstead, who died in a car wreck in New Orleans last
month. Texas Terri, who dedicated her entire set to the female rock
band by blazing through Betty Blowtorch songs, set the evening's tone
by leading the crowd in a Hindu chant.</LD>
<LD>   The veteran rocker was joined by Betty Blowtorch guitarist Blaire,
who shredded with unbridled passion. The grand finale, "Hell on
Wheels," was a rock 'n' roll love-in, with a gang of Hollywood
rockers onstage singing their hearts out. You guys have class....</LD>
<LD>   Speaking of class, our next stop was the Viper Room. We got there
just in time to settle in for Big Balls, the AC/DC tribute band
formed by top Hollywood rock musicians. I had an armload of German
tourists with me, and they're convinced they saw AC/DC. The band was
joined by Save Ferris' Monique Powell, who looked so hot you could
see flames coming outta her dress. I was so excited when I saw the
Viper Room's Sal Jenco take the stage to sing along on an AC/DC
classic, I grabbed my camera but was eighty-sixed by three
well-trained Viper employees.</LD>
<TE>   Luckily, promoters Josh Richman and Dayle Gloria saved the day,
and we settled back in just in time to see headliners Faster
Pussycat. Singer Taime Downe is such a rock star.... Speaking of rock
stars, big ups to the warmhearted citizens who phoned to tell me that
Mario Maglieri's name had been misspelled in a recent Club Buzz.
Whoops.... Speaking of Mario, his Rainbow burns eternal. I popped in
there recently and found it crawling with rockers.</TE>
<TE>   Most excellent New Year's Eve house parties: Soul singer Teena
Marie turned her Pasadena home into a gumbo- and tamales-fueled
funk-fest, while Shaquille O'Neal played king of his castle, treating
his guests to lavish lobster and steak dinners. Bling bling.</TE>

<DH>Rosie Flores is back for tribute to Elvis Presley, an
enduring influence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rosie Flores never got to see Elvis Presley. Back in 1977, when she
was leading an obscure San Diego band called Rosie &amp; the Screamers,
the young roots-rocker had finally made plans to see Presley live
when his tour was to pass through Southern California that year. But
he died before ever leaving home.</LD>
<LD>   Presley's impact on her love of music was already secure, going
back to the day an older cousin introduced her as a Texas toddler to
the hit "Teddy Bear." Flores has also frequently made the pilgrimage
to Graceland, Presley's Memphis home-turned-shrine, since moving to
Nashville two years ago. And with so many Elvis recordings, and so
many Elvis movies, Flores feels like she's seen him after all.</LD>
<LD>   "You feel like you get to know him every time you go into
Graceland," says Flores, who joins a big roster of colleagues Sunday
at the 17th annual Elvis Birthday Bash at the House of Blues in West
Hollywood. "Then you see all of his awards, and it makes you cry. You
look at these walls and walls of trophies and awards and gold
records. Man, this guy did this in such a short span of his life.
"He's become such an important legend to Americana and to roots music
and rockabilly," adds Flores, 51. "He really is the King. That name
seems to be suiting him more and more. And I find this all over the
world."</LD>
<TE>   That continued influence will be on display at Sunday's House of
Blues celebration. Flores has appeared at the annual tribute nearly a
dozen times and will be joined this year by rockabilly locals such as
James Intveld, Big Sandy and Billy Swan.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be good," Flores says. "You can't go wrong with Elvis'
material."</TE>
<TE>   Flores hardly needs an excuse to show her roots. Since the early
'80s, the singer-guitarist has been a fixture in the Los Angeles
music scene, mixing straight-ahead country with rockabilly and blues.
Her regular set list still includes songs by the likes of Gene
Vincent, Eddie Cochran, Tammy Wynette and Buck Owens.</TE>
<TE>   "It was something different," she says of performing what came to
be called roots music. "And I've always been a kind of a little bit
of a rebel. If something is too popular, I turn away from it. I like
stuff that's on the edge."</TE>
<TE>   Back then almost no one was doing such ancient rock 'n' roll songs
as "Be Bop A Lula" and "Shake Rattle and Roll."</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't do any of that stuff now. It's cliche. I try to do
in my live shows stuff that's a little more obscure."</TE>
<TE>   Alongside accomplished locals such as Dwight Yoakam and Dave
Alvin, Flores has long been an energetic and dependable champion of
the traditions of American music. After moving to Nashville, she
found a community of roots-based artists not unlike the scene she
remembered from '80s Los Angeles, including singer-songwriters such
as Jim Lauderdale, Lucinda Williams and Duane Jarvis.</TE>
<TE>   For all its reputation for ignoring country music traditions in
search of a lucrative crossover sound, Flores found a surprising
respect for history in Nashville. While venerable L.A. institutions
such as the Palomino faded away, in Nashville Flores can still see
Loretta Lynn at the Grand Ol' Opry or run into Brenda Lee at the
grocery store.</TE>
<TE>   She spends her nights at the "seedy clubs" of downtown Nashville,
where she might catch Bonnie Bramlett or Delbert McClinton onstage.
It's not unlike the times she could see the Blasters or Los Lobos or
Levi Dexter on the Hollywood club scene.</TE>
<TE>   "There's that buzz where everybody's hanging out and playing,"
says Flores with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   It was in Nashville that Flores found the direction of her jazzy
recent album, "Speed of Sound," which owes much to her own
rediscovery of Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington, Ella Fitzgerald and
other "jazzy lady crooners."</TE>
<TE>   The smoky sound of the album was suggested by longtime friend and
guitarist Rick Vito, who produced it for Eminent Records. "I can sing
a country song and twang as hard as Loretta Lynn if I want to,"
Flores says. "But the challenge is gone out for me. So I really like
the bluesy jazzy side."</TE>
<TE>   The closest thing to straight country on the album is a rave-up of
Johnny Cash's "Country Boy," which was released as a single. Her
version, she says, was inspired by childhood envy for her brother,
who got to go camping and fishing with their father. She's had her
revenge, living the lifestyle of the country boy she once imagined.
"Because I didn't become a housewife and managed to stay single and
without children all these years, I've kind of let that come true,"
Flores says. "I can go anywhere and do anything I want, and I'm still
kind of foot-loose and fancy free."</TE>
<TE>   The Elvis Birthday Bash, Sunday at the House of Blues, 8430 Sunset
Blvd., West Hollywood, 8 p.m. $15. (323) 848-5100.</TE>

<LD>   Ants in My Pants. Gunnar Madsen. Gee, Spot Recordings. CD: $14.
(800) 448-6369. www.gunnarspot.com</LD>
<LD>   Gunnar Madsen, founding member of the a capella group the Bobs,
broke into children's and family music with his delightfully original
1999 release, "Old Mr. Mackle Hackle." His unique follow-up is even
better. Again as much for adults to enjoy as children, with fab,
sophisticated instrumentals and vocals--some from his a cappella
roots--gorgeous melodies, and musical references to classic Elvis,
doo-wop, early 1960s rock and 1940s singing cowboys. It's as witty as
all get-out and often unexpectedly touching, too, reflecting Madsen's
gift for marrying zany lyrics with lovely melodies.</LD>
<TE>   A few of many standouts: "Welcome to My Fog," comfort for any kid
who struggles with a short attention span; the wonderfully lugubrious
"Ballad of the Lonesome Rider" ("I am a cowboy born to weep/See how
my tears water the desert"); the wacky, theatrical, "And the Children
Rolled," about the round and rambling offspring of a crooked man and
"a lady as straight as a pin."</TE>
<TE>   Also, songs about car trips are a children's music staple, but
Madsen's "Are We There Yet?" defies expectations. It's an exquisitely
mellow, Harry Nilsson-ish invitation to dream as the miles go by.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Down In the Backpack. Bill Harley. Round River Records. CD: $15;
cassette: $10. (800) 682-9522. www.billharley.com</TE>
<TE>   Out of sight, out of mind: NPR humorist and children's recording
artists Bill Harley's title track digs into moldy lunch leftovers,
lost library books, teachers notes and other forgotten items in a
school kid's backpack--to the tune of the Drifters' "Under the
Boardwalk." Harley, funny and soulful by turns, and joined by
children singing solo and chorus, also explores the meaning of
friendship, peace and respect for others. Throughout, he always rings
true, proving he's still one of the best when it comes to expressing
a kid's-eye view of uncertainties, hopes, pet peeves and pleasures.</TE>

<TE>   Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?--Time Traveler. DIC

DVD: $15.</TE>
<TE>   A first-time home video and DVD release of a three-part adventure
about two young detectives on the time-traveling trail of beautiful,
mastermind thief Carmen Sandiego. Her robbery spree takes her from
ancient Rome to Russia, circa 2101. Along the way, this high-energy,
colorful educational show--the live action and cartoon TV versions
have won several Emmys--offers viewers bite-sized lessons in history,
geography and the arts, from the definition of keystones and flying
buttresses, to Hannibal crossing the Alps and a list of works by
Tchaikovsky.</TE>

<TE>   Jim Henson's Bear in the Big Blue House: Potty Time With Bear and
Visiting the Doctor With Bear. Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment.
DVD: $25 each; 75 minutes each.</TE>
<TE>   Parents get a little help in two terrific DVDs, featuring two of
the all-time best episodes of the Disney Channel's show for toddlers
and preschoolers facing the great unknowns: toilet training and
visits to the doctor.</TE>
<TE>   Carefully written with child developmental advisors and executed
with just the right no-pressure tone, the resonant shows set
easy-to-identify-with child puppet characters in realistic
situations, with cozy, big Bear and kind Old Doc Hogg on hand to
offer calm reassurance and straightforward, demystifying explanations
about potty-time and checkups at the pediatrician. Each DVD also
includes two other episodes, plus songs.</TE>

<HD>Learning the Safe Way to Ride a Mountain Bike</HD>
<DH>Think it's a no-brainer? Even experienced riders say a free
course can teach them a lot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURIE K. SCHENDEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"It's like riding a bike," as the saying goes--meaning once you
learn, you don't forget. So when I recently got a mountain bike, it
never occurred to me to "learn" how to ride it. One harrowing trip
down a steep trail after a rain, into washouts that resembled the
Grand Canyon from my vantage point, and I was ready to seek a little
expert advice.</LD>
<LD>   On the first Saturday of each month, a free "Introduction to
Mountain Bicycling Skills" is offered in the Santa Monica Mountains
National Recreation Area, one of the Southland's most popular
destinations for those seeking backcountry trails. Cyclists 10 and
older wanting to learn the basics for a better bike ride can show up
at 9 a.m. on Saturday and pay the $2 parking fee at Malibu Creek
State Park. Bring a bike and helmet (state law requires helmets for
those 17 and younger).</LD>
<LD>   Of the 15 people gathered on a recent Saturday morning, a group of
10-year-old Boy Scouts and their dads was among the seasoned bike
riders who didn't appreciate the class until after it was over. The
boys belonged to Pack 227 from Agoura Hills. The young daredevils
who've grown up exposed to BMX acrobatics and extreme sports made it
clear they were taking the class only to earn a Scout badge.</LD>
<TE>   "Why do we need to do this?" Aaron Kovisto asked his dad, David,
before one drill. "I ride on a hill to school every day." But like
everyone else in the group, Aaron later admitted that he gleaned some
valuable information from the drills and instruction.</TE>
<TE>   Gaye Lowenstein, a 39-year-old financial advisor from Santa
Monica, said she hoped to learn a few tips for her safety. "I've been
riding for about six months, and I've had some pretty major falls,"
she said. "This is definitely beneficial."</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Monica Mountains provide a gorgeous, rustic "classroom"
of old oak trees, rolling hills and meandering rivers, with many
inviting dirt trails. Mark Langton, a volunteer instructor and member
of the Concerned Off-Road Bicyclists Assn., teaches the monthly bike
skills course. His sidekick is Ezra Dweck, a volunteer with a
mountain bike unit, a trail patrol sponsored by the California
National Parks and the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation and
Conservation Authority.</TE>
<TE>   The first rule of mountain biking: Wear a helmet. "I've seen
people out there with their helmet cracked open, and people without
helmets with their head cracked open," Dweck warned. During our
four-hour "crash course" on how to handle a bike over obstacles,
going downhill and under road conditions ranging from rocky to deep
sand, the importance of a helmet hit home.</TE>
<TE>   The first hour of class takes place in the relative calm of the
paved parking lot at the state park entrance. The instructors cover
equipment and simple maintenance, including a demonstration on how to
replace a flat tire tube. A tip: If a thorn punctures a tire, it's
best not to pull it out because "you might get a couple more miles
out of the tire," allowing you to return to civilization before it
goes flat.</TE>
<TE>   The parking lot provides nice obstacles and a level, smooth
surface on which to practice balance and efficient riding techniques.
After a quick check to ensure everyone's handlebars and seats were
about equal height, we rolled one by one over the cement stops to get
individual pointers on hand position and posture. Riders should stay
low, with elbows bent and relaxed, and hands always on the brakes,
thumbs under the handlebars.</TE>
<TE>   The techniques sound simple, but after repeated attempts, it's
obvious that proper posture takes some practice. We learned that
going up a hill, your rear stays in the saddle; going downhill, the
knees stay bent and rear remains up off the saddle. Trouble can arise
going downhill when the brakes are applied and the bike stops but the
body keeps going. "It's important to keep your body low, in the
crouch position," Langton said. "Keep the pedals level, stand up,
bend your waist and arms to get that nice center of gravity."</TE>
<TE>   Climbing requires more finesse than most mountain biking skills,
Langton said. The key is to keep the bike going straight forward and
to shift early, when you start to feel the pitch of the hill. "Look
where you want to go, not at the bushes--don't look at the bad
stuff," Langton shouted as we pumped our way up the rugged trail.</TE>
<TE>   Another tip: Be on the lookout for hikers and equestrians. They
don't always welcome mountain bikers because they can scare animals
or unsuspecting nature lovers. Announce your approach, saying, "Bike
behind." If you plan to learn mountain bicycling skills, take the
"mountain" part literally. Be prepared to sail down a steep hill and
trudge up an even steeper, when-will-it-ever-end trail, which is the
grueling class finale. Whether cyclists show up for class with a new
bike or one with mud or even cobwebs in the spokes, the instructors
assume the riders have a certain level of physical fitness.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a great idea; I learned a lot," said Scott Whelan, who
accompanied his son, Adam, to the class. The boy was just as
enthusiastic, not only because he earned a Scout badge, but also
because the class was actually fun. "My favorite part," Adam said
excitedly, "was going downhill."</TE>
<TE>   Mine too--now that I know how.</TE>

<LD>* The actor and director plays Malcolm X in the movie "Ali."</LD>
<LD>   Dancing Man: My two connections right now are Alex and Fez. Fez
knows the celebrity L.A. scene, what's hot, what's not. Alex happens
to know the whole salsa scene, which I've been getting into lately.
Alex de Silva, he's my salsa aficionado, and my teacher. So Friday
night, I go down and get my little class at the Mayan, and maybe stay
there or go to the Conga Room. Saturday, there's a class during the
day at the Edge Dance Studio. But I've learned to do it, and I've got
new salsa shoes. I'm the man!</LD>
<LD>   Brain Activity: Saturdays, I do something else interesting. A
professor of Islamic studies at UCLA has been having mini-seminars at
my house. I met him because I play Malcolm in the "Ali" movie, the
spiritual guide who helps Cassius Clay become Muhammad Ali, but since
Sept. 11, it's become much more relevant. We're studying the history
and different relationships to Islam vis-a-vis American foreign
policy.</LD>
<TE>   Body Activity: Then I go for the run on Venice Beach and usually
have someone ride along on a bike. I got from Playa del Rey to
Venice, past the guy with the turban who sings on roller skates. I'll
also hang out with the kids; I have two daughters and three boys.
We'll go for a bike ride up into Marina del Rey and I get to be
Father Goose. I also live next door to my mom, so I hang out with
her.</TE>
<TE>   Business Is Pleasure: I've been doing a series of interviews where
I interview people about the most traumatic things they've ever gone
through: Roger Daltrey, the Hudlin brothers, Lynn Redgrave, Will
Smith. It's for a book I want to put together, but it helps you grow
in your life. As actors and directors, we get stuck in our own
circle; to go outside that and ask these questions is very
liberating. Then I'd do some writing. I'm working on a script about
the birth of blaxploitation. I've been watching a lot of my dad's
[writer-director-actor Melvin Van Peebles] old flicks, which is a
great kick.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a sad confirmation of the vicissitudes of Hollywood that a
powerhouse performer like Donna Elaine Miller can remain a relative
unknown.</LD>
<LD>   Like many actors before her, Miller turns to the solo format to
show off her plentiful talents. As the director, composer and
performer of "Dear Diary," an autobiographical one-woman show
produced by the Ascending Artists Stage Company at Grove Theater
Center Burbank, she has ample opportunity to do just that.</LD>
<LD>   Skillfully accompanied by pianist Tommy Reeves, Miller traces her
personal fortunes, from her unloved childhood with an emotionally
distant father, to her arrival in Hollywood in search of stardom, to
her cruel disappointments on the singles scene. A happy marriage
punctuates the autobiographical progression, with a jubilant song of
self-affirmation ending the show.</LD>
<TE>   Musical offerings range from hilarious novelty numbers ("What I
Wouldn't Do for a Shoe") to sultry torch songs ("Home Alone"). Miller
is an obviously talented composer with a honey-smooth voice and an
embracing warmth that projects beyond the footlights.</TE>
<TE>   However, the autobiographical one-person show is an iffy medium,
one that presupposes some extraordinary circumstances in the life, or
in the telling.</TE>
<TE>   By that standard, Miller's life story seems a tad generic to
excite general interest. At times, "Diary" plays more like a
glorified cabaret set than an autonomous piece of theater. The
transitional segments are weak; Miller's laborious path toward
self-enlightenment smacks ever so faintly of narcissism; and the
continuing emphasis on her troubled relationship with her father
seems oddly impersonal.</TE>
<TE>   Structural shortcomings aside, Miller is a dynamite entertainer
whose keen wit is on ample display. Her short poem, "Fade to Black,"
about the travails of a middle-class African American actor in an
industry dominated by "ebonic" stereotypes, is as playful as it is
trenchant--a wicked combination.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Director Benjamin Hoppe embraces low economics and loosely blends
commedia dell'arte traditions by way of slapstick for a fun though
slightly perplexing production of Moliere's "The School for Wives" at
the Knightsbridge Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   This uncredited adaptation includes a character (sometimes with a
selected audience member) reading from the script or from script
annotations, as well as explanations for terms that might confuse and
a scattering of four-letter words. At first the defining of words
such as "cuckold" could be seen as an attempt to appeal to younger
audiences, but that is contradicted by the smattering of foul
language.</LD>
<LD>   John Lohr blusters and sweats with anxiety as the middle-aged
Arnolphe, who is raising his young ward Agnes (Sarah White) in
ignorance, in hopes that she will become his subservient wife.
White's Agnes is perkily innocent, wrinkling her brow in
concentration at every puzzling thought. Nick Collins' Horace exudes
youthful exuberance and over-the-top earnestness while pursuing his
true love, Agnes.</LD>
<TE>   In the minor roles, Jose A. Garcia as the clown, a notary and
Agnes' long-lost father, along with Paul Lirette and Kathleen
Campbell as Arnolphe's servants, provide some moments of comic
relief.</TE>
<TE>   Not all the scene changes are clearly delineated in this
bare-bones staging, yet this version has a charming, unpretentious
silliness, beginning at the usual pre-show announcements and
continuing to the final bows.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Making his epic World War II adventure "Dark Blue World" was an
exhausting enterprise for Czech director Jan Sverak. So exhausting,
he felt like quitting his job.</LD>
<LD>   "I was thinking during production what will be my next profession,
because I don't want to do this anymore," says Sverak, with a sigh.
"I was dying."</LD>
<LD>   "It was a forced march," adds the film's producer Eric Abraham.
"It was an exhausting 100 days."</LD>
<TE>   Sverak, 36, scored a hit with his last film, 1996's "Kolya," which
won the best foreign-language film Oscar. Written by and starring his
father, Zdenek Sverak, "Kolya" dealt with the friendship between an
aging womanizer and a young Russian orphan boy.</TE>
<TE>   "Dark Blue World," which was also written by his father, is a much
more ambitious production. Starring Ondrej Vetchy, Krystof Hadek,
Charles Dance, Tara Fitzgerald and Anna Massey, it tells the story of
the friendship between two Czech pilots, Frantisek (Vetchy) and Karel
(Hadek), who escape from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia to join
Britain's Royal Air Force. In England, they fall in love with the
same woman, Susan (Fitzgerald), whose husband is missing in action.
When Frantisek returns to Communist-occupied Czechoslovakia after the
war, he and pilots who flew for the RAF are imprisoned. The film,
which opened Friday, is in both Czech and English.</TE>
<TE>   Made for $7 million, "Dark Blue World" has been a huge hit in the
Czech Republic. "It opened in the middle of May," says Sverak, during
a recent visit with Abraham to Los Angeles. In late October, "we hit
1 million admissions, which is 10% of the population."</TE>
<TE>   It was an uphill battle to get financing, Abraham says.</TE>
<TE>   "What we realized is, to make this kind of a movie not in the
English language would be tough," says Abraham. "You have to see what
[the pilots] do convincingly in the airplanes. Maestro Spielberg has
shown us wonderful scenes, but he has the money. We didn't have the
money, so we had to find the key to enable us to make this film for
the budget. Many distributors in Europe said you will never be able
to pull this off--you have a period film, you have aerial sequences
and you have CinemaScope."</TE>
<TE>   So Abraham remembered a massive World War II film with many aerial
combat scenes: 1969's "Battle of Britain."</TE>
<TE>   "They had spent a fortune on aerial photography," says Abraham.
"They also had the virtue that a lot of these planes still existed. I
thought having spent so much money there must have been outtakes. And
sure enough, there were pristine, unused outtakes, and we were able
to create aerial sequences out of this material. But it is a
double-edged sword. We wondered if we should be telling everybody how
it happened. But money is the midwife of creativity, and when you
have less, you have to use sort of real creative ingenuity."</TE>
<TE>   Though the story about the two pilots is fiction, their fate upon
returning home isn't. Of the 2,500 pilots who flew for the RAF during
World War II, 90% were imprisoned by the communist government. "Some
of them spent just a year there," he says. "Some of them, six or 10
years, and some of them died there." And, Abraham adds, life wasn't
much better when they were released--they were only allowed to hold
menial jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them are still alive and are retired," says Sverak. "They
have a small pension. We started a foundation to support them."</TE>
<TE>   The foundation sent letters to the survivors and their widows
asking them what type of support they needed. "Most of them said they
were living such a modest life during communism that they don't feel
the need for anything but the feeling that someone cares; it is very
pleasing for them. What I realized is how good for the audience it is
to have the opportunity to send $5 to this [foundation]. After
watching the movie, they are so emotionally moved, they are ashamed
of what the Czechs did to their own heroes that they have the need to
do something."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the success of "Kolya," Sverak had planned to make his
next picture in English. "We had all the [American] studios open to
us, so I thought you can do whatever you want. So we [he and his
father] started to think about this subject."</TE>
<TE>   Sverak soon realized "Dark Blue World" couldn't be an American
production.</TE>
<TE>   "My father is very rooted in Czech culture. You can't let Czechs
be played by Americans. You have to have some differences in
language. The film is a conflict between two cultures, so somehow it
would be fake to make it all in English."</TE>
<TE>   Besides being a producer, Abraham also was Sverak's driver and
dialogue coach for the Czech actors. "The actors are phenomenal,"
says Abraham. "It is incredibly difficult for any actor to act
through the barrier of any language that is not their own. You very
rarely see foreign actors being able to act in English if they are
not completely fluent. They had an incredible task, but when you see
them on the screen, they are not mouthing the lines [in English],
there is emotion in their eyes and face."</TE>
<TE>   Sverak never planned to collaborate with his famous father. In
fact, at Prague's Film University, he studied documentary filmmaking.
"My father was a star and I said, 'I can't work with him. I can't do
feature films because I don't want to be measured next to him. I
won't want to be found as someone who is using his success to get up,
to use him as a vehicle.'"</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, he won a student Oscar for his ecological film short "Oil
Gobblers."</TE>
<TE>   "That was the year the Iron Curtain fell down and Czechoslovakia
was liberated. My father had a script for a film about his childhood
he had written. There was a director and a budget. But with the new
circumstances of freedom, [the director] decided to make a
blockbuster. It was a horrible movie. So the script was without a
director.</TE>
<TE>   "The studio said to my father, 'Your son has this student Oscar.
He's young and talented, let him direct the movie.' I never directed
a feature film before, but the script was nice and it was about my
father's childhood. It was called 'Elementary School' and it was
nominated [for a foreign-language] Oscar. I was 25."</TE>
<TE>   Sverak acknowledges, though, that he and his father have "many
problems, like all fathers and sons. But as collaborators we like
each other very much. We understand each other."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A scant six weeks remain until the Academy Award nominations are
announced, so it's time to put your moviegoing into overdrive if you
want to have the upper hand in water-cooler debates.</LD>
<LD>   The various critics groups, the AFI Awards and Golden Globe
nominations haven't clarified the front-runners, so the best strategy
is to concentrate on best picture possibilities, which usually bring
a lot of other nominations with them.</LD>
<LD>   "A Beautiful Mind" (tied for most Golden Globe nominations), "Ali"
and "Lord of the Rings" are accessible in theaters throughout the
Southland.</LD>
<TE>   "In the Bedroom" (L.A. Film Critics Assn.'s best picture and tied
for most AFI Award nominations) is in a dozen Southland theaters,
including the Laemmle Music Hall in Beverly Hills and Playhouse 7 in
Pasadena, AMC Promenade 16 in Woodland Hills and the Monica in Santa
Monica.</TE>
<TE>   "Gosford Park" is at the Laemmle Sunset 5 in West Hollywood,
Landmark's NuWilshire in Santa Monica and Loews Cineplex Century
Plaza, and added theaters Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Monster's Ball" is playing at the Sunset 5, Monica, Town Center 5
in Encino and the Playhouse 7, as well as Edwards' University Cinemas
in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   "Black Hawk Down" (tied for the lead with five AFI nominations) is
playing exclusively at the AMC Century 14 in Century City and the
Mann Criterion 6 in Santa Monica but goes into wider release later
this month.</TE>
<TE>   "The Shipping News" (Miramax's ability to garner best picture
nominations can never be underestimated) is in selected theaters,
including the UA Westwood, the AMC Century 14, the Sunset 5,
Playhouse 7, Pacific's Winnetka 21 in Chatsworth, Edwards Irvine
Spectrum 21 and Loews Cineplex Broadway Cinemas in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   "Mulholland Dr." (the New York critics' choice for best picture)
is in limited release at the UA Westwood, the Academy Cinemas in
Pasadena and the Laemmle Fallbrook 7.</TE>
<TE>   "The Man Who Wasn't There" is exclusively at the Academy Cinemas
in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   "Moulin Rouge" (six Golden Globe nods and the National Board of
Review's top film) is still playing at the Mann Westwood and the
Academy Cinemas.</TE>
<TE>   In case you'd prefer to see it in a theater instead of on video,
"Shrek" is at the Aero in Santa Monica and at the Sherman Oaks
Galleria 16.</TE>
<TE>   The Mann Westwood also has "Bridget Jones's Diary" (Renee
Zellweger has a Golden Globe nomination for best actress in a comedy)
and "The Others" (starring Golden Globe drama actress nominee Nicole
Kidman, who is also up for the musical "Moulin Rouge").</TE>

<HD>A Place Where Culture Remains Alive and Well</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It may smack of provincial boosterism, but Ventura County's cultural
pulse is strong enough to suggest the county may be a secret jewel in
the Golden State. Come year's end, a considered glance at what has
passed through in the arts confirms the area's dedication to keeping
culture alive. Perhaps humble by comparison to our urban neighbor to
the south, the cultural fabric here is bound by sturdy stitching.</LD>
<LD>   For one, we have a bold orchestra in the New West Symphony, a
contender in the rich ranks of Southern California's orchestral
scene. This year, maestro Boris Brott led the charges in a stirring
all-Beethoven program, and--in one of the year's musical
highlights--nobly ushered the ensemble in its first performance of
Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra. This fall, Brott's take on
Beethoven's "Eroica" had a special poignancy, coming, as it did,
shortly after the Sept. 11 disaster. The symphony's
contemporary-minded "Music's Alive" series brought the important
American composer Lou Harrison to town, a welcome returnee.</LD>
<TE>   In jazz, local fans were saddened by news of the recent demise of
66 California, for years the epicenter of the local jazz scene. The
downtown restaurant and club, run by Frank Parong for the past 15
years, has been one of the longer-lasting jazz venues in the region,
but the building's owner is selling the property. Local interest in
the music prevails, though. An ad-hoc concert venue, the "Ventura
Vanguard," kicked off a series of periodic shows in the accommodating
basement space of the Laurel Theater.</TE>
<TE>   On another level entirely, Diana Krall showed up at the Thousand
Oaks Civic Arts Plaza last month, on the heels of her finest album
ever. "The Look of Love," a collaboration with the great arranger
Claus Ogerman, shows that Krall's uncommonly high degree of
popularity (for a jazz artist) hasn't spoiled her sense of artistic
development.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura is also still a veritable hot spot in the left-of-center
scene where jazz culture melts into contemporary and experimental
music. New music performers on the international circuit stopped
here, courtesy of the hosting pfMentum organization, including
saxophonist John Butcher and double-bowing cellist Frances-Marie
Uitti.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mention festivals within the county limits, and the venerable Ojai
Festival leaps naturally and inevitably to mind. This year's festival
was a stellar affair featuring the return of internationally
respected conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen and his Los Angeles
Philharmonic, who performed Olivier Messiaen's stirring epic "Des
Canyons aux etoiles" (From the Canyons to the Stars), under the
stars, and a righteous blast of music by Mexican composer Silvestre
Revueltas. Soprano Dawn Upshaw gave an American-oriented recital, and
we were also wowed by Cuarteto Latinoamericano. This year's event
brought various chamber-sized musical treats to town, including
Edward Murray's harpsichord reading of Bach's "Goldberg Variations"
at City Hall and the Rosetti String Quartet with guitarist Pepe
Romero at the Serra Hall.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Other musical avenues were well-represented this year, as well.
There was the Bowlful of Blues, now happily relocated from Libbey
Bowl to its idyllic lakeside spot at Casitas Lake and featuring
Ojai's own guitar hero, Robben Ford. Rock has a steady home in the
Ventura Theater, and the Vans Warped tour stopped at Seaside Park
this summer. Country stars Brad Paisley, Wynonna and Glen Campbell
kicked up dust at the summer county fair.</TE>
<TE>   Opera surfaced in town, in resourceful, if not grandly operatic,
ways. Opera Unplugged kept up its performance schedule, gearing
toward ever loftier goals. The Ventura College Opera Workshop
marshaled the effort to present the charming, community-minded
production of Benjamin Britten's children's opera "Noyes Fludde"
(Noah's Flood), and soon enough after the terrorists attacks that the
work's communal message seemed heaven-sent.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The regional theater scene included a gala world premiere of Jenny
Sullivan's autobiographical "J for J" from Rubicon Theater in the
fall. The Ojai Shakespeare Festival centerpiece production,
"Falstaff: the Apprenticeship of Good Prince Hal," adapted from Henry
IV, parts 1 and 2, proved to be an engaging bit of midsummer theater.</TE>
<TE>   Film festival activity in the county has picked up, as well, and
the list includes the small but earnest Channel Islands Indie Film
Festival.</TE>
<TE>   The Ojai Film Festival, which focuses on efforts and ideals
outside mainstream Hollywood, held its second annual event.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In art, 2001 marks the year that the Art City gallery, long a
significant forum for art in town, closed its doors, hopefully to
return in a new location. But John Nichols, Santa Paula's seasoned
gallery-keeper, curator and photographer, opened two galleries in
Ventura. In October, the 18th annual Ojai Studio Artist's Tour--and
its stowaway "fringe" entity, the Art Detour--brought scores of
art-watchers.The Carnegie Art Museum in Oxnard remains a stalwart
exhibition space and kicked off the year with a solid exhibition by
Ojai-based painter Michael Dvortcsak. Other art worth seeing passed
through local spaces, including the Buenaventura Gallery, the
Upstairs Gallery at Natalie's Fine Threads, the Childress Gallery in
Ojai, the Ojai Center for the Arts, and Ventura College--one of the
best-kept semi-secrets in a town, which has its own cultural cachet
that shows no signs of letting up.</TE>

<HD>Sad Role Provides Sweet Vindication for Tomei</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KALTENBACH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1992, Marisa Tomei was the surprise winner of a best supporting
actress Oscar for the comedy "My Cousin Vinny," beating out respected
British actresses Joan Plowright, Judy Davis, Vanessa Redgrave and
Miranda Richardson.</LD>
<LD>   In some ways, she's been paying for that win ever since. Maybe her
performance in "In the Bedroom," as the woman whose love of a much
younger man leads to tragedy, will finally pay that debt in full.</LD>
<LD>   Almost from the day she won her Oscar, the Hollywood rumor mill
couldn't simply acknowledge that Tomei had given an assured,
terrifically funny performance as the gum-chewing, wisecracking
girlfriend of a neophyte lawyer played by Joe Pesci. No, there had to
be some other reason why this 28-year-old cinematic newcomer took
home the golden statue.</LD>
<TE>   And so the rumors started. Presenter Jack Palance had not worn his
glasses, so he simply read off the only name he could make out. Or he
figured it would be a good joke to announce Tomei's name. Or he
wanted to be sure an American got the nod.</TE>
<TE>   To this day, there are those who swear she did not really win her
award. No matter how many times the motion picture academy swears she
won fair and square, no matter how many times Palance insists he read
the name that was in the envelope, the doubts persist.</TE>
<TE>   "That was really hurtful at first," Tomei says over the phone. "I
was young, and I really didn't know the ways of the world on any
level. But now I know the ways of the world, so I'm just, like, OK. I
mean, it's so in the past."</TE>
<TE>   With luck, her heartbreaking performance in "In the Bedroom,"
which already has earned her a Golden Globe nomination, will silence
the rumormongers forever. Especially given her other performances
this past year, in the recent "Happy Accidents" and last year's "What
Women Want," this woman's acting chops should no longer be called
into question.</TE>
<TE>   Tomei says there's no grand plan behind the films she chooses to
make or even behind her approach to acting as a craft. "It's not
really a matter of saying, 'Oh, I want to do this and that,'" she
says. "It's more a matter of putting one foot in front of the other,
kind of stumbling through."</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to choosing a role, her considerations "take on a
different proportion for each project, whether it's a great role, or
it's a director I've always admired. A lot of times, I respond
thematically to a role. What's it about? Is it provocative? Does it
display a social conscience?</TE>
<TE>   "The greatest thing for me is for a director to trust me, to let
me do my thing. It's hard to verbalize what you're going to be
playing until you show up and do the character. Otherwise, it kind of
kills the magic."</TE>
<TE>   Director Todd Field's "In the Bedroom," she believes, is a film of
which to be proud, one that resists easy categorization. "There's
really no horse-beating, there's nothing that's really black and
white. There's a lot of room for discussion after you walk away from
the film, which I think is great. There is no one character who is
really good, or who is really evil. There's no one who is really a
stock character."</TE>
<TE>   Tomei reveals no real plans for the future. For now, she's happy
to keep jumping from project to project, often with little time
between films or even during the actual production. "There's a part
of me that would like to know what I'll be doing next, would like to
have a couple of things preparing while I'm working on something,
would like to have time to do a little more research. But I can't
dictate the entire business. I'm just a part of it."</TE>

<LD>Vroom! Vroom!</LD>
<LD>   The new year begins with the release of two high-octane thrillers
on DVD: the 1979 Australian classic "Mad Max," featuring Mel Gibson
in his first starring role, and last year's box-office hit "The Fast
and the Furious."</LD>
<LD>   The digital edition of "Mad Max" (MGM, $20) is a
pedal-to-the-metal ride. In this post-apocalyptic thriller, vicious
motorcycle gangs rule the countryside and it's up to a group of
devoted police officers to stop them. But when one particularly nasty
gang, led by the ruthless Toecutter, murders the wife and child of
officer Max Rockatansky (Gibson), the policeman goes into a mad
frenzy and seeks to avenge their deaths. The fast-paced film is
filled with exciting action stunts--all done way before digital
effects.</LD>
<TE>   When American International Pictures released "Mad Max" in the
U.S. in 1980, the studio scrubbed the original Australian soundtrack
and replaced it with one that was completely dubbed in by American
actors. Thankfully, the digital edition restores the original
Australian soundtrack. But viewers who have trouble understanding the
Aussies have the option of listening to the American version.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD also features the original trailer and a documentary, "Mel
Gibson: The Birth of the Star," which examines his early career at
acting school in Australia and features interviews with his friends
and even his acting teacher. The narration, though, is so florid it's
laughable. "Max Max: The Film Phenomenon" focuses on the film's
production and how all the dangerous car and motorcycle stunts were
created. However, a lot of the impact of the documentary is negated
by the overdramatic narration.</TE>
<TE>   Though director George Miller isn't involved in the DVD, special
effects coordinator Chris Murray, cinematographer David Eggby and
production designer Jon Dowding supply the interesting commentary.
Rounding out the disc is an animated "Road Rants Facts" trivia
feature.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike "Mad Max," Rob Cohen's street race thriller "The Fast and
the Furious" (Universal, $27) is chock full of special effects. In
fact, one of the early street-race sequences was all done digitally.
Loosely based on a Vibe magazine article about street racing clubs,
"The Fast and the Furious" stars Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Jordana
Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   The exciting digital edition includes a crisp wide-screen transfer
of the film; talent files; production notes; a fun behind-the-scenes
look at a stunt shot from eight camera angles; an interactive special
effects feature that looks at how different footage was combined to
create a stunt sequence; a visual effects montage of the first race;
the article "Racer X," on which the film is based; a featurette on
why a violent scene was toned down for the film to get a PG-13
rating; deleted scenes with commentary from director Cohen; music
videos; storyboard-to-final-feature comparison; and inspired
commentary from Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen admits that when he was first approached to do the film, he
read the Vibe magazine article and didn't think it would work as a
movie. But a few nights later, he went to watch illegal street racing
in San Fernando and was hooked. He saw the film as sort of a street
opera, a la "West Side Story," and used a lot of the real racers as
extras in the film. He also envisions "The Fast and the Furious" as
sort of a western--especially the sequence in which the masked street
racers carjack a truck filled with electronic goodies. That scene,
Cohen says, is his tribute to John Ford's 1939 classic "Stagecoach."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The delightful 1965 CBS telecast "Cinderella," the only TV musical
penned by the great Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, is
making its DVD debut (Columbia TriStar, $25) this week. Rodgers &amp;
Hammerstein originally wrote the musical for the live 1957 CBS
broadcast starring Julie Andrews as Cinderella. This version stars
then-18-year-old Lesley Ann Warren, Ginger Rogers, Walter Pidgeon,
Celeste Holm and Stuart Damon as Prince Charming. The lovely DVD
includes filmographies, bonus trailers, digitally mastered audio and
video and a short but sweet retrospective look at the production,
including new interviews with Warren, Damon (who replaced the
originally cast Jack Jones) and Holm.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Though audiences didn't flock to the offbeat comedy "The
Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension" back in
1984, it has developed a cult following over the past 17 years. Cult
status notwithstanding, it's still an acquired taste that's too hip
and precious for its own good. Peter Weller plays Buckaroo Banzai, a
brilliant brain surgeon and rock star who has made scientific history
by using his Oscillation Overthruster to become the first man to
travel the eighth dimension. However, his mortal enemy, Dr. Lizardo
(John Lithgow), wants to steal the Overthruster and bring an evil
army of aliens back to take over the universe. Jeff Goldblum, Ellen
Barkin and Christopher Lloyd are among the co-stars.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition (MGM, $20) includes a rare prologue sequence
featuring Jamie Lee Curtis as Banzai's mother, numerous deleted
scenes, a "making of" documentary that includes both new and old
footage and enjoyable audio commentary from director W.D. Richter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the past 40 years, French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard
has enthralled, angered and confounded critics and audiences alike
with his uncompromising, demanding and distinctly uncommercial films.
Fox Lorber has just released three of his earliest films on DVD
($25): "Breathless," "Le Petit Soldat" and "Les Carabiniers."</TE>
<TE>   "Breathless" (1960) was Godard's first feature and set the cinema
world on its ear with its use of the hand-held camera, jump-cutting
and pacing.</TE>
<TE>   His most accessible and best-loved work, "Breathless" stars
Jean-Paul Belmondo as a hood who is on the lam in Paris after he
kills a cop. Jean Seberg is the American girlfriend who ultimately
betrays him. The great Raoul Coutard supplied the gorgeous
black-and-white, often hand-held cinematography.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD features the transfer of a beautifully restored print and
audio track and often overly enthusiastic commentary from David
Sterritt, a film professor who has written two books on Godard.</TE>
<TE>   Sterritt offers about 15 minutes of commentary on the disc of
1963's "Le Petit Soldat," Godard's spy thriller that, even at just
under 90 minutes, is a long sit.</TE>
<TE>   Set during the Algerian War, "Le Petit Soldat" deals with a young
French deserter who becomes involved in the French nationalist
movement. Anna Karina, who was married to Godard, plays the young
man's girlfriend who he doesn't know is working for the other side.
The film was banned in France for several years because it notes that
France and Algeria used torture during the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "Les Carabiniers" (1963) is even more confounding and difficult to
watch--an antiwar movie that also has dark comedic elements and
banal, insipid characters.</TE>
<TE>   Sterritt provides the mini-commentary.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Carriers On-Time Rate Climbs for November as Air
Travel Declines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major U.S. carriers, led by AMR Corp.'s Trans World Airlines,
completed 84.7% of flights on time in November as fewer travelers
boarded planes after the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The combined on-time rate of the 11 largest U.S. carriers rose
from 72.8% in the year-earlier month but slid from 84.8% in October,
the U.S. Department of Transportation said. Airlines laid off
workers, canceled flights and asked for U.S. government financial aid
to avoid bankruptcy after the attacks reduced air travel.</LD>
<LD>   "There were fewer airline flights, particularly at major hub
airports," Federal Aviation Administration spokesman William Shumann
said. "The weather was unusually benign."</LD>
<TE>   TWA made 87.5% of flights on time, followed by Delta Air Lines
Inc. and US Airways Group Inc. at 86.7%. Alaska Air Group Inc.'s
Alaska Airlines placed last among the carriers, making 75.9% of
flights on time, followed by UAL Corp.'s United Airlines at 80.8%,
the agency said. Flight cancellations, mishandled baggage and
complaints declined.</TE>
<TE>   Flight delays slid 61.4% to 13,246 in November from 34,365 in
November 2000, the FAA said. Delays because of bad weather, the
biggest source of slowdowns, fell 63%, while delays because of air
traffic fell 73%, the FAA said.</TE>
<TE>   The on-time performance of "the whole industry has improved
dramatically" after record delays last year, partly because of fewer
fliers and the replacement of jets that needed more maintenance,
United spokesman Joe Hopkins said. The carrier made 69.1% of its
flights on time in November 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska Air declined to comment. AMR, which stopped using the TWA
name on Dec. 2, didn't immediately return a call. The Transportation
Department counts flights as on time if they arrive within 15 minutes
of the schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Flight cancellations fell to 1.1% of scheduled flights from 2.3%
in November 2000, the agency said. Reports of mishandled baggage slid
to 3.82 per 1,000 passengers from 4.96 per 1,000 a year earlier.
Complaints fell 62.9% to 516 from 1,390 in November 2000.</TE>

<HD>Arthur Andersen's Audit Standards Pass Review</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUDY MATHEWSON</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arthur Andersen, the auditor of Enron Corp., said it received
unqualified good marks from its peer reviewer, Deloitte &amp; Touche,
after what Andersen called "the most extensive peer review in the
firm's history."</LD>
<LD>   Andersen said that Deloitte's review of 240 of its audits for the
year ended Aug. 31 found "reasonable assurance" that the firm's
quality control standards comply with professional standards.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen, the fifth-largest accounting firm, had asked Deloitte
for additional scrutiny because of financial reporting issues at
Enron. Deloitte &amp; Touche said it independently determined to conduct
additional checks in light of the collapse of Enron, which filed last
month for the biggest bankruptcy protection in U.S. history after
saying it overstated earnings.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen's last review, in 1998 by Deloitte, the third-largest
accounting and consulting firm, didn't report any problems. Deloitte
&amp; Touche declined immediate comment on the latest review.</TE>
<TE>   The Public Oversight Board, an accounting industry oversight
group, plans to look at the adequacy of the peer review system as a
result of the failed Enron audits. The system puts some of a firm's
reports on public companies under scrutiny by other accounting firms
in an effort to assure investors the firm's methods comply with
professional standards.</TE>
<TE>   The oversight board also dispatched three or four auditors from
its staff to monitor Deloitte &amp; Touche's peer review of Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking at the systems and specific areas affected by the
Enron type of business," board Chairman Charles Bowsher said in an
interview last month. "A lot of people get hurt when an Enron
happens."</TE>

<HD>AOL to Fix Messaging Security Gap</HD>
<DH>Computers: Researchers discover breach in Instant Messenger
that can leave users vulnerable to hackers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A security hole in AOL Time Warner Inc.'s Instant Messenger program
used by millions worldwide can let a hacker take full control of a
victim's computer, according to security researchers and the company.</LD>
<LD>   An AOL spokesman said the problem will be fixed soon, and users
won't have to download anything. "We have identified the issue and
have developed a resolution that should be deployed in the next day
or two," AOL's Andrew Weinstein said. "To our knowledge, this issue
has not affected any users."</LD>
<LD>   The problem affects the newest versions as well as many earlier
iterations of AOL's Instant Messenger program. Discovered by a loose
team of international researchers called "w00w00," the hole is a
"buffer overflow," like the problem recently found in Microsoft
Corp.'s Windows XP.</LD>
<TE>   By sending a stream of junk messages to the program, a hacker can
overwhelm the software and make the victim's computer run any
commands the hacker wants. "You could do just about anything--delete
files on the computer or take over the machine," w00w00 founder Matt
Conover said.</TE>
<TE>   Conover said w00w00 has more than 30 active members from 14 states
and nine countries. Until AOL's fix is released, Conover said,
Instant Messenger users should restrict incoming messages to friends
on their "buddy list."</TE>
<TE>   "It will at least keep someone from attacking you at random,"
Conover said, but it wouldn't help if the attack code is added to a
virus that propagates without the victim's knowledge. AOL said it has
not given its users any advice.</TE>
<TE>   Conover said the group found the problem several weeks ago but
didn't contact AOL until after Christmas. The group didn't get any
response from AOL through an e-mail during the holiday week, he said,
so w00w00 released details of the security hole--and a program that
takes advantage of it--to public security mailing lists less than a
week later.</TE>
<TE>   The program released by w00w00 remotely shuts down a person's
Instant Messenger program but could be modified to do more sinister
things.</TE>
<TE>   That practice is under scrutiny by security professionals.
Although some independent researchers argue for a "full disclosure"
policy and say software vendors are trying to cover up their
mistakes, many companies say users are better protected if the
company has time to react.</TE>
<TE>   Russ Cooper, who moderates a popular security mailing list and
works for security firm TruSecure, said Conover's actions are
irresponsible.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's better to provide details of the exploit and then
let other people write the actual code," Cooper said. "Unfortunately,
these are fundamentally naive people with a very childish view of the
world."</TE>
<TE>   Cooper said he let Conover send the information through his
mailing list only after noticing it was released through other
channels.</TE>
<TE>   Conover said w00w00 set a New Year's deadline for sentimental
reasons, because it was the anniversary of the group's last major
security release. He defended the disclosure of the attack program.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the approach that w00w00 has historically taken to the
problem," he said. "For us it means providing all the information we
have available to the security community."</TE>
<TE>   AOL's Weinstein said the company would have appreciated more
warning. "We'd encourage any software programmer that discovers a
vulnerability to bring it to our attention prior to releasing it," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Future Is Now for Creator of Predator</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: Unmanned vehicle made by San Diego's General
Atomics is helping revolutionize warfare in skies over Afghanistan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush has been able to tune in video images of Taliban
targets in Afghanistan from the safety and comfort of the White
House, giving the commander in chief a powerful capability.</LD>
<LD>   The top-secret television feed from the war zone is forwarded via
military satellites from the Predator, a remotely controlled spy
plane built by a relatively obscure San Diego aerospace firm.</LD>
<LD>   Able to hover over an area for more than 24 hours at a time, the
Predator has helped to revolutionize warfare by providing
instantaneous intelligence and battlefield control to commanders who
are hundreds and even thousands of miles away.</LD>
<TE>   But the Predator has carried out another task that seemed
unthinkable just a year ago. In the first search-and-destroy mission
of its kind, a Predator attacked and destroyed a target with Hellfire
missiles launched from an external weapons rack.</TE>
<TE>   It was a transforming moment in aviation history, marking the
first time that a drone aircraft--controlled by a crew in a trailer
hundreds of miles away--not only found the target but tracked it,
fired at it and then even stuck around to see what kind of damage had
been caused.</TE>
<TE>   It was also a defining moment for General Atomics Aeronautical
Systems Inc. of San Diego, the privately held maker of the Predator,
which after nearly a decade of virtual obscurity was suddenly thrust
into a blaring limelight as television and newspapers around the
world reported on the aircraft's exploits.</TE>
<TE>   Even Bush lauded the Predator's abilities, singling it out as an
example of how the conflict in Afghanistan "has taught us more about
the future of our military than a decade of blue-ribbon panels and
think-tank symposiums."</TE>
<TE>   "Before the war, the Predator had skeptics, because it did not fit
the old ways," Bush said during a major defense policy speech at The
Citadel military academy in Charleston, S.C., last month.  "Now it is
clear the military does not have enough unmanned vehicles. We're
entering an era in which unmanned vehicles of all kinds will take on
greater importance--in space, on land, in the air and at sea."</TE>
<TE>   The notoriety comes nearly a decade after six engineers, including
a retired Navy admiral, started the company with a vision to develop
an aircraft that could be controlled from long distances and
instantly relay back video and radar images of what it was looking
at.</TE>
<TE>   Remotely-controlled drones were widely used by battlefield troops
in the past but their use was severely limited. They could not travel
far because they would lose radio contact with ground controllers and
they were unable to provide real-time images. Photographic images
taken by their cameras had to be processed once the drones returned
to base.</TE>
<TE>   In the beginning, the company was much like an Internet start-up
where the founders worked 20 hour days, seven days a week to prove to
Pentagon officials that their aircraft would not repeat the failures
of past pilotless drones.</TE>
<TE>   The company began in 1991 as a subsidiary of General Atomics, a
nuclear power contractor, but was spun off and became an independent
entity three years later.</TE>
<TE>   "They would say, 'we don't need any more UAVs,'" said Thomas P.
Cassidy Jr., the company's chief executive and a former admiral. "But
they were thinking about the old drones that couldn't do much. They
just couldn't see its use for long-range reconnaissance."</TE>
<TE>   Now, with more than 600 employees, General Atomics is considered a
leading maker of so-called unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs. It has
built 70 Predators for the Pentagon and has orders for 15 more. Each
of the propeller-driven aircraft costs $3million to $5million
depending on how it is equipped. A deployable system, which includes
four Predators, a control trailer and other support equipment, costs
$20million to $25million, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. military response in Afghanistan thrust the company into
the limelight and may make selling the aircraft a lot easier, Cassidy
said.</TE>
<TE>   Additional follow-up orders are expected and in recent weeks the
Air Force acquired two new aircraft developed by the company, dubbed
Predator B, a larger and more advanced aircraft powered by a propjet,
for $26million. The Air Force took possession of the first Predator B
even though it was still undergoing test flights.</TE>
<TE>   The company also has doubled Predator production to four per month
at its 450,000-square-foot facility in Rancho Bernardo in San Diego
County. Meanwhile, the company is building the Predator B at another
complex in the San Bernardino County town of Adelanto. By next
summer, the company expects to have another 100 employees.</TE>
<TE>   "We planned for it [the expansion] all along," Cassidy said.
"We've been kind of astute or just lucky."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed. Although the Pentagon did not acknowledge that Predators
were firing missiles at ground targets in Afghanistan until only two
weeks ago, General Atomics had been working on the capability for
more than a year and a half. In fact, the Air Force first tested the
missiles last February against stationary tanks in the Nevada desert.</TE>
<TE>   And in recent weeks, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. John Jumper
acknowledged that the U.S. was using unarmed Predators in tandem with
AC-130 Spectre gunships. The AC-130s brought their 105-millimeter
cannons and 40- and 25-millimeter rapid fire weapons to bear on
targets identified by the Predators. The AC-130s now have video
screens on board that provide live images from the Predators, Jumper
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are entering a new era for unmanned air vehicles," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A key aspect of the Predator is its control system, company
executives say.</TE>
<TE>   In the ground control center for the Predator--just a trailer
painted in camouflage colors--a pilot remotely controls the aircraft
using a joystick while watching several display monitors. One monitor
displays a map on the aircraft's location while another provides a
live video image of the aircraft's exterior. Another computer screen
monitors the functions of the aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Except for the lack of windows and ejection seats, the interior of
the trailer closely resembles the cockpit of a B-1 bomber. The
copilot, who remotely controls various sensors on the aircraft, sits
next to the pilot.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, like a weapons officer in the bomber, the trailer also has
a seat for a sensor officer behind the pilots who watches and records
the radar images and live video feeds picked up by the Predator's
sensors and cameras. The officer can redirect the pilot to fly the
aircraft over an area or ask the co-pilot to zoom in on a target.</TE>
<TE>   But the Predator has not been free of problems.</TE>
<TE>   An internal Pentagon report completed last month said tests
conducted last year found that the Predator was failing to meet
operational requirements set two years ago. The report said that
while the Predator is very capable when operating in clear weather,
it had poor targeting accuracy, ineffective communications and could
not operate effectively in poor weather.</TE>
<TE>   General Atomic executives downplayed the report, which they said
was outdated because most of the problems have since been fixed or
resolved. Moreover, they said the testing was limited to only a few
days.</TE>
<TE>   Cassidy said the Predator has the highest mission capable rate, or
the percentage of aircraft available for a sortie at any given time,
than any U.S. military aircraft. They are operating at 97%, Cassidy
said. By comparison, the B-2 stealth bomber has one of the lowest
mission capable rates with only a third of the fleet able to fly a
mission.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Afghanistan, the Predator is deployed in five other
foreign locations that remain classified.</TE>
<TE>   Prior to Afghanistan, the Predator had been deployed in four other
military conflicts since 1994, including its first significant combat
mission over Bosnia, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other aircraft makers who rely on subcontractors and
suppliers to provide the majority of the components, nearly 90% of
the parts for the Predator are made by General Atomic.</TE>
<TE>   Often the parts are commercially available, off-the-shelf
components that are modified for the Predator. The engine for the
Predator B, for instance, is an Allied Signal 331-10 gas turbine
engine, an engine in common use on business jets. Using commercially
available components is one way the company holds down costs.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of growth potential in the airplane. We haven't
even scratched the surface," Cassidy said.</TE>
<TE>   The company is working with the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration to use modified Predator Bs that can conduct
environmental surveillance. The company also is looking at other
commercial applications such as the use of a Predator variant as a
platform for providing aerial communication links.</TE>

<HD>EchoStar Fires Back in Feud With Disney</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Satellite television broadcaster EchoStar Communications Corp. struck
back in a bitter contract dispute with Walt Disney Co. on Wednesday,
accusing the company of taking a "hypocritical" view of consumer
interests and applying political pressure to keep its ABC Family
channel on the air.</LD>
<LD>   "The current dispute between EchoStar and Disney is simply about
EchoStar trying to protect its customers from Disney, a giant media
conglomerate that has imposed rate increases well beyond the rate of
inflation," EchoStar said in a statement.</LD>
<LD>   Disney had sued EchoStar, asking a Los Angeles federal judge for a
restraining order after EchoStar said it would stop carrying ABC
Family as of Tuesday to make room for other channels. EchoStar has
argued that under an agreement it signed in 1995 it has the right to
drop ABC Family if there is a change in its control.</LD>
<TE>   The broadcaster has also complained about fee increases Disney has
levied for its channels and what it says are weak ratings for ABC
Family.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the L.A. judge issued a temporary restraining order
that bars EchoStar from dropping Disney's ABC Family until Jan. 10.</TE>

<HD>End of Factory Slump May Be on the Horizon</HD>
<DH>Economy: A survey of purchasing managers shows the decline
in manufacturing slowing and orders rising.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN, JOSEPH MENN and NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's disastrous slide in manufacturing--the critical economic
sector that has bled 1 million jobs since mid-2000--may finally be
coming to an end.</LD>
<LD>   An index of manufacturing activity released Wednesday showed a
continued decline, but at the slowest rate in 14 months. Moreover,
the new orders component of the index rose to its best reading since
April 2000.</LD>
<LD>   "After a long bout of decline, things are starting to stabilize,"
said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Bank of America.</LD>
<TE>   Still, most analysts said they expect few manufacturers to add
workers to their payrolls any time soon, and that the nation's
unemployment rate should continue to climb for at least several more
months.</TE>
<TE>   In all, it was moderately encouraging news for manufacturing
workers, a swath of the work force including well-paid unionized auto
workers along with minimum-wage laborers in garment-sewing shops. The
manufacturing sector, whose collapse led the nation into its current
recession in March, has accounted for a shrinking portion of U.S.
employment for years but remains an important engine for the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's report from the Institute for Supply Management said
its purchasing managers index rose to 48.2 last month, up from 44.5
in November and 39.8 in October. December's level was the highest for
the gauge since October 2000, although it suggests that manufacturing
still is declining, albeit more slowly.</TE>
<TE>   More encouraging, the component of the index focusing on new
business orders was at 54.9, up from 48.8 in November, largely
because of improvement in high-tech fields, a key part of the
California economy.</TE>
<TE>   In the overall index, a reading above 50 indicates growth and
anything below 50 reflects decline. The findings were based on
responses by 260 to 270 purchasing executives across the country to a
monthly poll by the institute.</TE>
<TE>   The institute's report came exactly one year after Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan began a series of 11 interest rate cuts that,
together with low energy prices and increasingly tight inventories,
are widely expected to spur recovery.</TE>
<TE>   The report from the institute, previously known as the National
Assn. of Purchasing Management, squared in some respects with other
recent upbeat economic indicators.</TE>
<TE>   A batch of reports released Friday showed a gain in orders for
nondefense durable goods, along with increases in consumer confidence
and home sales.</TE>
<TE>   To a large extent, the latest reports reflect an economy that has
shaken off the effects of the Sept.11 terrorist attacks, but that
also remains stuck in a recession. For instance, the Institute for
Supply Management's overall purchasing index was at 48.2 in December,
up only slightly from August's 47.9.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy has proven to be quite resilient after the Sept. 11
event, and it's pretty much back, in terms of the indexes, to the
levels where we were prior to Sept. 11," said Norbert J. Ore, who
chairs the institute's manufacturing business survey committee.</TE>
<TE>   "Some industries are showing signs of recovery," Ore added. "We
have to remember that as the economy starts to recover, it doesn't do
it with every industry all at once."</TE>
<TE>   The main cause for hope came in the new orders component of the
institute's index, a forward-looking indicator that in December
reached a level suggesting significant economic growth ahead. The new
orders component had plunged from 50.3 in September to 38.3 in
October, when the full effect of the Sept. 11 attacks was registered.</TE>
<TE>   Those new orders came largely in high-technology industries, which
drove the U.S. and California economic booms in recent years and then
helped lead the national and state economies into their downturns.</TE>
<TE>   Further evidence of a possible high-tech pickup came Wednesday
from the Semiconductor Industry Assn., which reported that worldwide
sales in November rose to $10.6 billion, an increase of 1.6% from
October.</TE>
<TE>   The trade group said it was the second straight month of increases
and predicted that December would show further gains, moving the
industry off the bottom it hit in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more of a trend, not just a blip," said SIA spokeswoman
Molly Tuttle. "Hopefully, we'll stay on this path of slow but steady
growth."</TE>
<TE>   The association forecasts that 2002 sales will increase 6% to $150
billion, and that by 2004 volume will exceed the record of $200
billion set in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Computer chip makers said increased sales of personal computers,
wireless telephones and automotive components are leading the way up.
Last month, Intel Corp. and rival Advanced Micro Devices both raised
their revenue projections for the quarter that ended last week.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Dell Computer Corp., the biggest seller of PCs, said
the Windows XP operating system and new chips from Intel helped
increase demand. Analysts said that companies that bought computers
in the late 1990s because of the Y2K scare are due to upgrade their
systems soon.</TE>
<TE>   For semiconductor companies, "half the problem has been solved,"
said S.G. Cowen analyst Drew Peck.</TE>
<TE>   Peck added, however, that even though stock prices of chip
companies reflect investors' expectations of a swift recovery, "the
bad news is the real consumer recovery is probably going to be long
and arduous."</TE>
<TE>   In the auto industry, strong sales in recent months spurred by
zero-interest financing have depleted manufacturers' inventories.
Still, industry officials don't appear confident that sales will
continue to be brisk enough to warrant calling back laid-off workers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody around here is declaring victory, because
many of the indicators are still at levels that are below last year,"
said George Pipas, Ford Motor Co.'s director of sales analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, temporary help agencies, which supply workers to many
manufacturing plants during peak production periods and in the early
stages of economic recovery, have not yet seen an increase in demand,
said Darin Meadows, Los Angeles manager for Manpower Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "We think we're still bouncing along the bottom in this," he said.
"We, and many others, are not forecasting any real growth until the
third or fourth quarter."</TE>
<TE>   Although Meadows expects a slow start to 2002, the current mood is
far better than last year, when manufacturers were focused on laying
off workers, he said. "It's a new year, a new budget and some renewed
optimism," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Ore said he didn't expect recovery until the second half of
the year. "Where is the growth really going to come from?" Ore asked.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we've got excess capacity in a lot of industries, so
capital investment is not going to be there. We know information
technology spending has dropped tremendously, so that's not going to
fuel the economy the way it did in the late '90s. We know our
[foreign] trading partners are soft. Their economies are like ours or
worse in most cases, so the demand is not going to come from there.
So, it's really up to the American consumer."</TE>

<HD>Senate Will Investigate Enron Debacle</HD>
<DH>Energy: Two panels led by Democrats will begin probe. Focus
could include firm's ties with Bush administration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Two key Senate Democrats on Wednesday announced new investigations
into Enron Corp.'s financial meltdown, with one of the probes
possibly touching on the company's dealings with the Bush
administration.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), chairman of the Governmental
Affairs Committee, plans to start hearings Jan. 24. And Sen. Carl
Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations, intends to subpoena company documents for an
examination into the conduct of Enron officers and the company's
auditor.</LD>
<LD>   "Something was very rotten in the state of Enron," Levin said.</LD>
<TE>   At least five other congressional investigations are planned or
underway in addition to probes by the Justice and Labor departments
and the Securities and Exchange Commission. But Lieberman's hearings
could prove politically riveting because he is regarded as a
potential presidential candidate in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman said his committee's inquiry would focus on whether
government agencies could have done more to protect thousands of
Enron employees and investors hurt by the largest bankruptcy in U.S.
history.</TE>
<TE>   "Where was the SEC?" he asked. "Where was the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission?"</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman also said the hearings could explore Enron's ties to the
Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay was a major donor
and fund-raiser for Bush in the 2000 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be a search for the truth, not a witch hunt,"
Lieberman said. "We're going to go wherever that search takes us, and
we're not ruling anything out. It's a matter of public record that
executives of Enron had close relationships with people who are now
in the Bush administration."</TE>
<TE>   Congressional Democrats have pushed for the White House to release
details of private meetings last year between Enron executives and
administration officials on energy policy.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me that now, after the collapse of Enron, we have
even more reason to want to know what Mr. Lay was saying to the
administration," Lieberman said. "What advice was Enron giving the
administration, and was it in any way self-serving?"</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Bush said that he had no recent contact with Enron
executives and that he would let the probes lead where they may.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman also noted that Enron officials had close relationships
with some Democrats, and he said those links could be examined.</TE>
<TE>   Levin said his inquiry would look into "what appears to be a
massive shell game [by Enron officials] with multiple layers of
conflicts of interest."</TE>
<TE>   These conflicts, he said, included the use of offshore business
entities and limited partnerships that masked the firm's true
finances.</TE>
<TE>   Houston-based Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection a
month ago after disclosing it had overstated its earnings by $586
million during the last four years. Its stock has tumbled from more
than $90 a share a year ago to less than a dollar. Its shares closed
Thursday at 63 cents, up 3 cents on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Levin said his panel will try to find out "what did Enron's top
officers and board members know [about the company's financial
condition], when did they know it and what did they do about it."</TE>
<TE>   The probe also will look at why Enron's accountant, Arthur
Andersen, did not catch the financial problems beforehand.</TE>
<TE>   "Our job is to find out where current laws failed," Levin said.</TE>
<TE>   Some congressional Republicans also are eager to find out what
happened to Enron. In the GOP-controlled House, aides to Rep. W.J.
"Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the Energy and Commerce
Committee, are preparing to sift through 2 million documents sought
from the company.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), top Republican on the subcommittee
headed by Levin, expressed support for the investigation he has
launched, saying she was concerned by reports that top Enron
executives sold company stock at a high profit while lower-level
employees were forbidden from selling shares of the stock in their
retirement accounts.</TE>

<HD>Smooth Debut Boosts Euro on World Markets</HD>
<DH>Money: Continent shrugs off conversion bugs as new currency
begins circulating. First robberies are reported.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BRUSSELS</DL>
<LD>"Europhoria" swept the European public and currency markets Wednesday
as traders saluted the largely flawless new year's launch of euro
notes and coins by boosting the currency's value against the dollar.</LD>
<LD>   Commuters and shoppers mostly shrugged off the inevitable
confusion and queues when more than 300 million Europeans in 12
nations began using their common currency on the first working day of
the year.</LD>
<LD>   There were big crushes in German and Dutch banks as customers
braved freezing weather to trade in old marks and guilders, even
though national currencies can be used for two more months.</LD>
<TE>   "People are coming in, emptying their wallets onto the table and
saying, 'I want euros,'" said Oliver Froehlich, euro-transition
leader at the Frankfurter Volksbank.</TE>
<TE>   There also were some first euro robberies to report: A gunman in
Athens made off with nearly $70,000 worth of the new bills from a
post office. In Ireland, police said three robbers threatened staff
at a bank branch before grabbing about $1,800 worth of euros from a
till and escaping in a waiting car.</TE>
<TE>   The euro, launched three years ago initially for electronic
transactions, had mostly declined in value since. It first began
trading at a value of $1.17, but fell below 83 cents by October 2000.
On Wednesday, however, the currency's value jumped to 90.4 cents in
New York from 89.1 cents Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The euro also appreciated Wednesday against the British pound and
the Japanese yen, in what one banker called a "relief rally" after
forecasts of chaos proved unfounded.</TE>
<TE>   Top retailers across Europe reported a smooth day's trading but
there were some hitches. Travel agents in Italy were unable to issue
train tickets because of a software conversion problem. About 150
Dutch post offices had to remain closed for similar reasons.</TE>
<TE>   European Monetary Affairs Commissioner Pedro Solbes said he was
"extremely satisfied" with the efficiency of the changeover, billed
as the biggest peacetime logistical exercise in history.</TE>
<TE>   About 80% of cash dispensers in the euro area already had been
converted and more than half of all transactions should be in euros
by the end of the week, Solbes said.</TE>
<TE>   Early-morning travelers faced some delays due to the unfamiliarity
of the new coinage. Bottlenecks were reported at highway toll gates
around Rome and Paris and in Greece as motorists struggled with
change.</TE>
<TE>   Many drivers and shoppers tried to pay for small purchases with
old large-denomination notes to get change in euros.</TE>
<TE>   Still, newspapers hailed a remarkably smooth start to the biggest
monetary switch in history. "Euro without a hitch," declared France's
Liberation daily on its front page.</TE>
<TE>   Germany's mass circulation Bild, once a standard-bearer of
deutschemark patriotism, enthused: "We are sharing this feeling of a
euro birth with 300 million Europeans. Forget yesterday. Look bravely
to tomorrow. Let's all start afresh!"</TE>
<TE>   By eliminating currency risk and creating price transparency in
their single market, euro states hope to make their economies more
competitive and encourage trade, travel and investment.</TE>
<TE>   The 12 nations that have adopted the euro are Germany, France,
Italy, Austria, Portugal, Spain, Finland, Ireland, Greece, Belgium,
the Netherlands and Luxembourg.</TE>
<TE>   Britain, Sweden and Denmark are keeping their own currencies for
now.</TE>
<TE>   The next major hurdle for the new currency will be on Saturday,
traditionally the biggest shopping day of the week in Europe.</TE>

<HD>Group's Effort to Boost Electronic Filing Backfires</HD>
<DH>Taxes: IRS contradicts preparers' claims about
anthrax-related delays processing returns and sending refunds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A national tax preparers group is urging Americans to file their
returns electronically this year ''as a patriotic gesture'' and to
avoid anthrax-related postal delays.</LD>
<LD>   The only problem is that the IRS doesn't expect any slowdowns this
year in processing returns or getting people their refunds because of
anthrax.</LD>
<LD>   ''We're always getting strange things in the mail, and we've had
screening processes in place for years,'' said IRS spokesman Don
Roberts. ''We don't anticipate any changes'' because of anthrax
concerns, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The National Assn. of Enrolled Agents sent a news release
Wednesday saying just the opposite. The trade group, which represents
10,000 tax preparers, claimed that because of anthrax worries the IRS
would use "an off-site mail facility to process all incoming mail,"
which "could result in delays in refunds and posting of tax filing
dates."</TE>
<TE>   The news release went on to say that "extra work, time and effort
on the part of IRS employees" to process paper returns could be
eliminated "if, as a patriotic gesture of support, every taxpayer
would file their returns electronically."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the IRS processes returns at 10 centers throughout the
country and has no plans to use additional mail facilities, Roberts
said. The IRS has long screened its mail for dangers such as anthrax
as well as for unusual items, such as clothing sent by taxpayers
("the shirt off their backs") and checks carved in wood or made with
other unlikely materials, Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   Electronic filing does save the government time and money, which
is why Congress has mandated that 80% of all returns be e-filed by
2007. E-filing also speeds taxpayers' refunds and eliminates most
math errors.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, some 40 million of the 127 million taxpayers who filed
returns did so electronically, and the IRS hopes 45 million will use
e-filing this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly like the idea of people encouraging electronic
filing, but we don't exactly agree with the way [the NAEA] got
there," Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Cranford, the NAEA's director of public policy, said she
and other NAEA officials were briefed by senior IRS officials in
December about possible anthrax-related delays during the filing
season.</TE>
<TE>   Cranford said the news release, which was drafted and sent while
she was on vacation, probably should not have predicted that there
would be problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have crafted it more artfully," Cranford said.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS did experience some delays last year in getting its mail
because of anthrax detected at Washington's Brentwood postal
facility, which processes mail for the service's headquarters as well
as for many other government agencies in the nation's capitol.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS issued a news release Dec. 20 saying that taxpayers who
had filed petitions with the U.S. Tax Court might have received
collection notices in error because of mail delays.</TE>
<TE>   The Tax Court, which normally notifies the IRS to stop collection
actions when it receives a taxpayer's petition to hear a case, did
not receive mail postmarked in mid-October until Nov. 29 because of
the Brentwood problems.</TE>

<TE>   The Benefits of E-Filing</TE>
<TE>   Filing a tax return electronically can dramatically speed up a
refund and eliminate math and other errors that can delay a return's
processing. Here's what taxpayers should know:</TE>
<TE>   Why e-file? E-filing can result in a refund in two to three weeks,
compared with four to eight weeks for a return on paper.</TE>
<TE>   To speed refunds further, taxpayers can ask the Internal Revenue
Service to deposit returns directly in their bank accounts. E-filing
also eliminates common mistakes such as incorrect Social Security
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   How to e-file: Returns can be filed electronically via a tax
preparer, by using tax-preparation software such as Intuit's TurboTax
or by using a tax-preparation Web site such as H&amp;R Block's
www.hrblock.com. The cost is typically included in the tax
preparation fee, although some preparers charge an additional $20 or
so.</TE>
<TE>   How to pay: Taxpayers who owe the IRS money also can file their
returns electronically. These taxpayers can either mail a check, pay
by credit card or instruct the IRS to deduct the balance owed from
their bank accounts.</TE>

<HD>FTC Warns 71 Web Sites Selling Bioterror Products</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. officials said Wednesday that they warned 71 Web sites selling
products that claim to protect against biowarfare agents to remove
any claims they cannot support with scientific evidence or risk legal
action.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Trade Commission said the warnings, sent via e-mail,
were the second wave in an effort to crack down on Internet sites
that try to sell fraudulent products to Americans worried about
bioterrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of Web sites began offering antibiotics, gas masks, air
filters and other products in October after the discovery of letters
tainted with potentially deadly anthrax spores.</LD>
<TE>   Internet searches by state and federal authorities found more than
200 sites marketing bioterrorism-related products.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-November, the FTC warned 50 Web sites, and more than half
of those have eliminated suspect claims, the FTC said.</TE>
<TE>   Those warnings went mostly to firms promoting cures or treatments
for anthrax or other possible bioterror weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent warnings, issued in December, were sent to
different firms selling protection devices such as air filters, gas
masks, protective clothing and ultraviolet light devices.</TE>
<TE>   Some masks and clothing do offer shielding from some contaminants,
but the FTC warned firms that they must have evidence to back up any
claims they make.</TE>
<TE>   In one letter, the agency said there is no filter or cartridge
that can protect against every possible contaminant and said
companies should not claim that a gas mask or respirator is effective
against all contaminants.</TE>
<TE>   Penalties for making deceptive or misleading claims can include
injunctions or civil fines of up to $11,000 for each violation, the
FTC said.</TE>
<TE>   Sellers also could be forced to refund customers' money.</TE>
<TE>   The FTC has not publicly named the firms that received the
warnings, citing the ongoing investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities identified suspicious promotions through searches done
by officials working for the FTC, the Food and Drug Administration,
more than 30 state attorneys general and the California Department of
Health Services.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Probing Reports of Steering Problems on '97 Pontiac
Grand Prix</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. regulators are investigating 18 reports of failed steering
components on General Motors Corp.'s 1997 Pontiac Grand Prix cars, a
probe that may lead to a recall of 143,653 vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's monthly
report said two crashes occurred because of the failure of a
rack-and-pinion steering unit on the cars. The steering system locked
up in 14 of the incidents and steering was difficult during turns in
four of the cases, the agency said.</LD>
<LD>   NHTSA began a preliminary evaluation of the Grand Prix complaints
on Nov. 14. In three of the cars, a dust cap fell off the
rack-and-pinion steering system, the agency said.</LD>
<TE>   "GM's cooperating with the investigation," said Jim Schell, a
spokesman for the largest auto maker. He said he wasn't aware of any
reports of the problem collected by the Detroit-based company.</TE>
<TE>   The automotive safety agency also closed a probe of defective
water-pump pulleys in 1994-1998 Saab 900 cars on Nov. 19 and denied a
petition seeking additional investigation of the vehicles, which now
are made by the Saab division of General Motors. NHTSA opened that
probe in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Saab carried out a campaign in April 1997 to replace the water
pump in all 1994-1998 Saab 900S cars with four-cylinder engines if
they were found not to have the newly designed water pumps, NHTSA
said. The new pumps used pulleys that were bolted to the pump shaft,
rather than ones that were welded on, and could separate after metal
fatigue cracks occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Saab's efforts to redesign the pulley and replace water pumps of
the previous type made the use of NHTSA's "limited resources" for the
problem unnecessary, the agency said.</TE>

<HD>Audit Finds Homestore Overstated Revenue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Homestore.com Inc., which operates the Internet's largest residential
real estate site, said Wednesday that its revenue during the first
three quarters of 2001 were overstated by as much as $95million,
according to an audit of the company's finances.</LD>
<LD>   The preliminary results probably will require the once-highflying
Westlake Village-based company to make "material restatements" to
financial reports for 2001 and 2000, according to Homestore
officials.</LD>
<LD>   The company warned that "investors should not rely" on the
financial reports and statements Homestore filed with government
regulators during the first three quarters of last year.</LD>
<TE>   For the nine months ended Sept. 30, the company initially reported
revenue of $350.9 million and a net loss of $245.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore management had long stressed that its advertising
revenue was on a solid footing and derived mostly from large,
mainstream companies.</TE>
<TE>   "It gave us the impression that their advertising revenue ...
would be less cyclical and would be at far less risk than your
typical dot-com," said Jay P. Leupp, an industry analyst at the
investment firm Robertson Stephens.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore is the latest former technology darling to confess that
its revenue had been inflated. In doing so, it joins such companies
as messaging infrastructure provider Critical Path Inc., video game
publisher Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. and Internet media
company StarMedia Network Inc.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as this summer, the online provider of real estate
information ranging from sales listings to interior decorator
referrals appeared to be weathering the downturn that had knocked
many of its Internet brethren to their knees.</TE>
<TE>   But last month, in separate announcements, Homestore disclosed
that its board of directors was investigating the company's books and
that Chief Financial Officer Joseph Shew had resigned because of
personal reasons after less than a year in the position.</TE>
<TE>   Trading in Homestore shares--which were priced above $80 two years
ago--has been suspended for more than a week after a request from
Nasdaq Stock Market officials for information from the company.
Homestore stock last traded at $3.60 a share.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the company said that the audit being conducted by
its board and independent financial specialists had unearthed
problems with the way the firm had accounted for online advertising
deals.</TE>
<TE>   The audit found that between $54 million and $95 million in online
advertising transactions from the first three quarters of 2001 had
been incorrectly reported as revenue. Instead, the transactions
should have been accounted for as barter deals because they were
related to purchases of goods and services from third parties.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it expects to complete its audit by the end of
the first quarter of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "We are committed to a thorough inquiry," Homestore spokesman Gary
Gerdemann told Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   Gerdemann declined to give additional details about the audit and
would not say whether any Homestore employees had been reprimanded as
a result of it.</TE>
<TE>   The company's accounting practices and financial health came into
question in November after Homestore said third-quarter advertising
sales had plunged 44% from the previous quarter. Ad sales made up
nearly one-fourth of the company's revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore also said in November that it had lost three of its
major advertisers and probably would be unable to replace that
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore now expects fiscal 2002 advertising revenue to be less
than one-third of 2001 levels.</TE>
<TE>   The disappointing results followed the company's announcement that
it would restructure by cutting up to 700 jobs--about 20% of its
total work force at the time--and reorganizing into two operating
units.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the company's mounting problems, the National Assn. of
Realtors said Wednesday that Homestore will continue to operate the
trade association's popular Web site, Realtor.com.</TE>
<TE>   The industry trade group, a major Homestore shareholder and
business partner, said its Web site had not experienced any
disruptions and it has no plans to switch to another company,
spokesman Steve Cook told Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. of Realtors owns 3.8% of Homestore stock and
its chief executive, Terrence McDermott, sits on the company's board.</TE>

<HD>Hynix's 3rd Price Boost Helps Lift Chip Sector</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hynix Semiconductor Inc., the third-largest maker of computer memory
chips, said Wednesday that it raised prices for the third time in
less than a month as demand improved, providing hope that a steep
industry sales downturn may have finally bottomed out.</LD>
<LD>   The news had an immediate effect on the shares of Hynix
competitors, all of which posted strong gains Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Hynix raised long-term contract prices for memory chips by 30%,
spokeswoman Kang In Young said. She didn't provide more details. The
South Korean company raised prices twice in December, by 20% each
time.</LD>
<TE>   Sales of computer memory chips, which analysts say fell by 60% in
2001 to about $12 billion, may finally have hit bottom. The cash
price of a 128-megabit dynamic random-access memory chip, an industry
benchmark, rose 61% since Dec. 1 as personal- computer makers used
inventory and placed orders.</TE>
<TE>   Hynix's price increase "hints the industry isn't worsening
further," said analyst Eric de Graaf at ING Barings, who rates
Infineon shares "hold." "The question is, will prices fall again?"</TE>
<TE>   Chip shares advanced. Infineon's American depositary receipts
gained $2 to close at $22.30 on the New York Stock Exchange. Micron
Technology Inc., the second-largest DRAM maker, rose $2.24 to $33.24
on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   "The DRAM industry is currently experiencing healthy demand
leading to a better pricing environment," said Katja Schlendorf, a
spokeswoman at Infineon, the fourth-largest memory-chip maker. "It's
too early to assess if it's sustainable." Prices for cash sales of
memory chips rose 8% on Monday to $2.36.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hynix shares rose to a six-month high in South Korea on
expectations Micron will submit an offer for some of its assets next
week.</TE>
<TE>   Hynix rose as much as 10.4% to 3,070 won. The stock surged for a
second day on reports citing Hynix creditors as saying Micron would
propose buying some of Hynix's facilities next week. Micron spokesman
Sean Mahoney declined to comment, except to say talks were
progressing.</TE>
<TE>   "The rise is based mostly on individual investors' hopes that some
sort of deal between Micron and Hynix may emerge next week," said
Chang Deuk Soo, head of research at Shin Young Securities Co. in
Seoul. "We'll just have to wait and see whether those hopes are
justified."</TE>

<HD>Warranty Helps Hyundai Post Biggest U.S. Sales Gain in 2001</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hyundai Motor America, which stumbled badly in its early years in the
U.S. with a cheap car that sullied the image of South Korean vehicles
for years, completed a turnaround effort in 2001 that gave it the
biggest annual sales gain in the industry last year. Hyundai's 42%
jump to 346,235 cars and sport-utility vehicles also set a U.S.
annual sales record for the company.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts say Hyundai was helped by its strong 10-year powertrain
warranty, the redesign and re-engineering of all existing cars in its
lineup and the addition last year of a well-received SUV, as well as
an upscale large car.</LD>
<LD>   Hyundai rocked the U.S. auto industry when it first arrived in
1986 with a $2,995 economy car, the Excel, setting import sales
growth records for several years because of its low prices. But as
consumers became aware that older Excel models were prone to
overheating, brake fade and breakdowns, they dropped Hyundai from the
consideration list. From a then-record 264,000 sales in 1988, Hyundai
fell to 100,000 in 1990 and stayed in that range throughout the
decade.</LD>
<TE>   A succession of aggressive U.S. management teams pushed for and
won major quality improvements in the company's Korean-built cars.
And two years ago, the company instituted an unprecedented 10-year or
100,000-mile powertrain warranty. The plan, according to Finbarr
O'Neil, president of the Fountain Valley-based U.S. import arm of
Hyundai Motor Co., was to underscore Hyundai's improved quality and
new vehicles with a strong corporate guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   The warranty program started showing results almost immediately:
Hyundai sold 164,000 vehicles in the U.S. in 1999 and 244,000 in
2000.</TE>

<HD>Kmart Shares Fall to a 30-Year Low</HD>
<DH>Retail: An analyst warns that the chain could be close to
filing for bankruptcy protection if sales don't pick up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kmart Corp. stock fell 13% to a 30-year low Wednesday after worries
that its dismal holiday sales could push the nation's second-largest
discount chain closer to bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   The plunge was another reflection of the mounting troubles facing
Kmart, which continues to be dogged by dirty stores, poor inventory
controls, slow apparel sales and increased competition. The Troy,
Mich.-based chain's same-store sales declined in October and
November, falling below the company's reduced expectations, despite
the company's prominent position in the discount sector--one of the
hottest retailing groups since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Kmart officials, however, dismissed suggestions of a bankruptcy
filing, saying the firm has plenty of financial resources and is
carrying out a turnaround plan.</LD>
<TE>   Wednesday's sell-off began after the release of a report by
Prudential Securities analyst Wayne Hood, who took the unusual step
of warning about a possible Chapter 11 filing if Kmart fails to boost
sales in the first half of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Hood also issued a "sell" rating on the stock--another rarity
among Wall Street analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart shares fell 72 cents to close at $4.74 on the New York Stock
Exchange after trading as low as $4.48 during the day.</TE>
<TE>   In his report, Hood joined other analysts who had cut estimates of
Kmart's fourth-quarter earnings per share by more than half, from 42
cents a share to 20 cents. The new numbers for the fourth quarter
would mean a loss for the year of 12 cents a share, as opposed to
earlier estimates of a profit of 15 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   "The next six months represent a critical time for Kmart and we
would not be surprised if the company were to file Chapter 11
bankruptcy if trends do not improve," Hood wrote. "Indeed, we are not
sure why management wouldn't file" in order to make dramatic changes,
walk away from underperforming assets and liabilities and make itself
more attractive to the market or an acquirer.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart spokesman Jack Ferry dismissed suggestions of bankruptcy,
saying the company's tough time in the third and fourth quarters
comes from working on a revitalization plan against the backdrop of a
slower economy.</TE>
<TE>   "Kmart has sufficient funds and available lines of credit to
continue to carry out its strategies," Ferry said. "What we're doing
here is for long-term benefits and it's clearly a marathon and not a
sprint."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles billionaire supermarket magnate Ronald W. Burkle, who
a year ago announced he had bought a 6% stake in Kmart, said the
discounter has been focusing too much on competing with the world's
biggest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., and not enough on smaller
drugstores and supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   Burkle said he still holds his stake, but has "collared" his
shares, a complex financial maneuver to limit his risk.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a real opportunity in different regions where there's no
strong operator, and that was the business plan I said I was willing
to buy stock into," said Burkle, who owned the Ralphs and Food4Less
supermarket chains before selling them to Kroger Co. in 1999. "And I
think they have done that, but they have not gotten the Wal-Mart out
of them."</TE>
<TE>   Kmart's avenue for competition with those regional sellers, its
newer supercenters, is what is most at risk from the company's
dwindling cash flow. In addition to slower sales, analysts say, Kmart
has been plagued by inventory problems, ending the third quarter with
5.6% more inventory than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   In a November call with analysts, Kmart Chairman Chuck Conaway
described efforts to fix the antiquated inventory control system as
critical to the company's survival. Kmart is spending more than $1
billion to renovate inventory systems that leave the chain "woefully
uncompetitive" on costs, Conaway said.</TE>
<TE>   But despite recent improvements, the chain remains "significantly
behind our nearest competitor," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The last several months have been littered with one negative
announcement after the next and that has weighed on the market," said
Daniel Binder, an analyst with Buckingham Research Group in New York.
"There should be concerns with liquidity but I don't think there's a
crisis yet, that would take another three quarters of negative 2% to
3% sales comparisons."</TE>
<TE>   Burkle said that although the company has a tougher road ahead,
bankruptcy is unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they've ever had enough money to build the
supercenters out the way they should and it's going to be harder to
do now," he said. "But in 1995, there were those same rumors [about
bankruptcy] and those turned out to be wrong. At the end of the day,
I think they'll be in good shape."</TE>

<HD>Late Stock Rally Lifts First Session of 2002</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Treasury bond yields rise after better-
than-expected manufacturing report, but Dow still gains 0.5% to
10,073; Nasdaq jumps 1.5%, led by chip shares.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street investors began the new year cautiously Wednesday,
putting off buying until the last hour of trading but still giving
stocks a respectable advance. Bond yields jumped on concerns the
Federal Reserve's yearlong string of interest rate cuts is ending.</LD>
<LD>   A report that manufacturing activity rose more than expected in
December failed to trigger buying in the stock market for much of the
day. But it rattled bond investors: Treasury yields had their biggest
one-day rise in a month as the manufacturing data made it less likely
that the Fed will continue the rate-cutting campaign it began one
year ago today.</LD>
<LD>   "Any data that point to the economy turning around lead to concern
the Fed is finished cutting rates," money manager Michael Materasso
of Fiduciary Trust Co. International told Bloomberg News.</LD>
<TE>   The Fed's 11 rate cuts last year have pulled shorter-term Treasury
yields to 40-year lows. But longer-term yields, which aren't directly
controlled by the Fed, have been rising since early-November,
reflecting growing belief that the economy will recover this year.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday the 10-year Treasury note yield jumped to 5.16% from
5.02% Monday. The yield plunged in the wake of the terrorist attacks,
but now is above its level when the Fed began cutting short-term
rates a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The two-year T-note yield climbed Wednesday to 3.20% from 3.05%
Monday. It still is far below its level of a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Stock and bond markets were closed Tuesday for New Year's, and
trading Wednesday was relatively subdued, indicating many investors
hadn't yet returned.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Dow Jones industrial average finished up 51.90 points,
or 0.5%, at 10,073.40, after falling as much as 85 points. The Nasdaq
composite index rose 28.85 points, or 1.5%, to 1,979.25, and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index advanced 6.59 points, or 0.6%, to
1,154.67.</TE>
<TE>   Winners barely outnumbered losers on the New York Stock Exchange.
Advancing issues led decliners by about 7 to 6 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The Institute of Supply Management, formerly known as the National
Assn. of Purchasing Management, reported that its index of
manufacturing activity rose to 48.2 in December from 44.5 in
November--its highest level since October 2000. The report indicated
that the manufacturing sector still is contracting, but at a slower
pace.</TE>
<TE>   "The manufacturing orders were favorable; they did give a bit of a
boost to the market," said Alan Ackerman, executive vice president of
Fahnestock &amp; Co. "But the market is wrestling with attempts to find a
footing after a turbulent year and amid light trading."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's early selling was attributable to investors locking in
profits before what's expected to be a new wave of quarterly
corporate earnings warnings starting next week, traders said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are probably going to be a few unpleasant surprises," said
Bill Barker, investment strategist for Dain Rauscher.</TE>
<TE>   Among blue-chip stocks, AT&amp;T rose 56 cents to $18.70 after Merrill
Lynch raised its near-term rating on the stock to "buy" from
"neutral." Merck climbed 96 cents to $59.76; General Electric gained
87 cents to $40.95; and Ford advanced 50 cents to $16.22.</TE>
<TE>   But retailers were weak after having suffered one of the worst
holiday sales seasons in at least a decade. Kmart fell 72 cents to
$4.74 after Prudential Securities reduced its rating on the
discounter to "sell" from "hold."</TE>
<TE>   Other market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Energy stocks were generally lower, despite a 6% jump in oil
prices. Among oilfield services companies, Halliburton was off 83
cents to $12.27; BJ Services fell $2.30 to $30. 15; and Tidewater
lost $1.04 to $32.86. Also, Marathon Oil fell 25 cents to $29.75, but
Exxon Mobil added 30 cents to $39.60.</TE>
<TE>   Crude oil rose $1.17 to $21.01 a barrel in New York trading as
cold weather in the Northeast led to a rise in heating oil demand.
Also, major oil exporters last week pledged hefty production cuts,
though analysts have been skeptical that the cuts will significantly
boost crude prices.</TE>
<TE>   * Tech stocks got a lift from chip makers, which rose after South
Korea's Hynix Semiconductor, the world's third-largest memory chip
maker, said it was raising prices. Rival Micron Technology rose $2.24
to $33.24.</TE>
<TE>   Chip makers also benefited from an upbeat report by the
Semiconductor Industry Assn., which said semiconductor sales rose
1.6% to $10.6 billion in November, the second straight month of
growth. Intel advanced $1.55 to $33, Broadcom gained $3.57 to $44.44
and Xilinx jumped $2.50 to $41.55.</TE>
<TE>   * Overseas, Japan's financial markets were closed for the New
Year's holiday, and will reopen Friday. In Europe, stocks were mixed
and investors were cautious following Tuesday's debut of the euro,
Europe's new single currency. French stocks lost nearly 1%, while
shares were flat in Britain and up marginally in Germany.</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Regulators kept in place a rate increase for customers of
California's two largest utilities, units of PG&amp;E Corp. and Edison
International.</LD>
<LD>   The California Public Utilities Commission voted 4 to 1 to deny
the request for a rehearing on the 2001 rate increase by the Utility
Reform Network, a San Francisco-based consumer group, Commissioner
Richard Bilas said. The commission did decide to hold a new hearing
on the end of a rate freeze in place since 1998.</LD>
<LD>   The commission raised rates 46% in March after Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric and Southern California Edison accrued billions of dollars
in debts after buying power at prices far above what they were
allowed to charge customers.</LD>
<TE>   The rate increase "was put in place in very different
circumstances than are in place right now," said Mindy Spatt, a
Utility Reform Network spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   The commission also denied a request by PG&amp;E and Edison to
reconsider a related change in how the utilities account for debt,
Bilas said after the closed-door meeting.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco-based PG&amp;E's shares rose 21 cents to $19.45.
Rosemead, Calif.-based Edison's shares rose 35 cents to $15.45.Both

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp., the largest auto maker, is replacing its
zero-interest loan sales campaign with an offer of a $2,002 discount
on cars and trucks.</LD>
<LD>   The company ran television advertisements with the cash offer on
New Year's Day in the Chicago area. The ads included a tag line
saying consumers will get a break on vehicles they "actually want to
buy." That echoes comments that have been made by Vice Chairman
Robert Lutz, who was hired by GM in August to improve the auto
maker's designs.</LD>
<LD>   The company's no-interest loan offer expired Wednesday, and GM
declined to confirm details of the replacement program or say whether
the Chicago ads will be rolled out nationwide.</LD>
<TE>   "We'll come out with our plans tomorrow," said spokesman Jeff
Roegner.</TE>
<TE>   GM first offered no-interest loans after the Sept. 11 attacks,
giving up profit it would receive from interest over the life of the
loan to spur sales. An interest-free, 60-month loan would save a
buyer between $4,000 and $7,000 in interest costs, dealers have
estimated. The company's incentive costs rose from $2,335 a vehicle
in August to $2,664 in October, Merrill Lynch analyst John Casesa
estimated.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the best years ever in sales but one of the worst for
profit," said Lehman Bros. analyst Nick Lobaccaro.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Detroit-based GM rose 4 cents Wednesday to $48.64 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pillow and blanket maker Pillowtex Corp. filed a bankruptcy plan that
would allow the company to repay creditors and complete its
reorganization.</LD>
<LD>   Under the proposed recovery plan, all Pillowtex shares would be
canceled and shareholders would get nothing for their investment.
Once reorganized, the company will give new shares to its secured
creditors. Unsecured creditors would receive a combination of new
shares and stock options. Pillowtex would emerge from bankruptcy with
about $200 million of debt.</LD>
<LD>   The Dallas-based company filed for Chapter 11 protection in
November 2000 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, citing more than
$1.66 billion in assets and $1.4 billion in debt, including $400
million in bond debt.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Pillowtex, which reported $1.35 billion in fiscal 2000
sales, fell 1.3 cents to 5.5 cents in over-the-counter trading.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Medtronic Inc., the biggest manufacturer of pacemakers and other
devices that monitor heart rhythm, received U.S. regulatory approval
for a system that lets doctors monitor patients' hearts via the
Internet.</LD>
<LD>   The Food and Drug Administration approved Minneapolis-based
Medtronic's CareLink Monitor to be used by patients with implanted
heart defibrillators. CareLink includes a small computer mouse-like
device that patients hold over their chests to record heart activity.
The results are sent over a phone line to a secure Web site that
doctors can access. The call is free.</LD>
<LD>   The company is seeking FDA approval to use CareLink with
pacemakers and devices that treat heart failure, Medtronic spokesman
Scott Papillon said.</LD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. won a bankruptcy judge's
approval of its $835-million bid to buy underwear maker Fruit of the
Loom Inc.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Peter Walsh in Wilmington, Del., declared
Berkshire's bid "the highest and best offer." In fact, it was the
only bid submitted at a Dec. 18 auction.</LD>
<LD>   The decision clears the way for Fruit of the Loom to move forward
with its bankruptcy reorganization plan, which uses the proceeds of
the sale to repay some creditors' claims. Walsh will decide whether
to approve the plan in March.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Chicago-based Fruit of the Loom rose 2 cents to 25 cents
in over-the-counter trading. Class A shares of Omaha, Neb.-based
Berkshire Hathaway fell $1,300, or 1.7%, to $74,300 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Shares of Tyco Fall on Probe Speculation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Tyco International Ltd., which has made more than $55
billion in acquisitions in the last five years, fell 2.8% on
speculation the company again may be the subject of a Securities and
Exchange Commission investigation.</LD>
<LD>   Tyco isn't under investigation by the SEC, said Maryanne Kane, a
company spokeswoman. The shares fell $1.65 to $57.25 on the NYSE.
Tyco's shares rose 6.1% last year.</LD>
<LD>   SEC Insight, a private research firm, said it was denied a request
for information on Tyco by the SEC in November. That may mean the
company is being investigated, the firm said. In July 2000, Tyco said
the SEC ended a probe of its accounting practices and recommended
that no action be taken against the company.</LD>
<TE>   SEC Insight routinely asks for federal documents on publicly
traded companies, said John Gavin, president of the Plymouth,
Minn.-based research firm. Questions about the timing of Tyco's
disclosure of the former SEC investigation helped raise concern about
the credibility of management, he said.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Raytheon Co., the third-largest U.S. defense contractor, was awarded
a five-year contract valued at as much as $1.22 billion for 234
aircraft to train Air Force and Navy pilots.</LD>
<LD>   An initial one-year contract for 40 planes, ground-based training
devices and technical support is valued at $193 million. Deliveries
of the planes are scheduled to begin in 2004. The Air Force and Navy
have options for 194 of the T-6A Texan II planes through 2008, said
Tim Travis, a Raytheon spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   The military's Joint Primary Aircraft Training System program
calls for nearly 800 aircraft through 2017. The Air Force approved
full production of the plane last month after Raytheon fixed problems
that had delayed the decision four times since January 2000,
including engine malfunctions and flaws in the plane's
air-conditioning system.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Lexington, Mass.-based Raytheon fell 58 cents to $31.89
on the New York Stock Exchange. The T-6A contract is the largest
received by Raytheon's Wichita, Kan.-based aircraft unit.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Weyerhaeuser Co., the No. 3 lumber-and-paper maker, said it won't
raise its $7.76-billion bid for Willamette Industries Inc. because it
can't find enough savings from the merger to justify a higher price.</LD>
<LD>   Directors of Portland, Ore.-based Willamette are scheduled to meet
this week, possibly to make a decision on whether to accept the offer
of $55 a share. Weyerhaeuser said in a statement that it couldn't
find much more in savings than the $300 million it already had
identified.</LD>
<LD>   Weyerhaeuser, based in Federal Way, Wash., has been pursuing
Willamette for more than a year. Willamette last month agreed to talk
with Weyerhaeuser for the first time after the company increased its
bid from $50 a share.</LD>
<TE>   Willamette shares fell $1.47 to close at $50.65, while
Weyerhaeuser fell 42 cents to $53.66, both on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>Record-low yields on money market mutual funds may be driving more
savers in the funds to shift that cash elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   Total assets of taxable and tax-free money funds slid $52 billion
in the seven days ended Wednesday, to $2.24 trillion, Imoneynet.com
said. Money fund assets fell $10.4 billion in the previous week.</LD>
<LD>   Much of the shifting of dollars away from money funds so far is by
institutional investors rather than individuals, Imoneynet.com said.</LD>

<LD>Continuing its turnaround efforts, PacifiCare Health Systems Inc.
announced a "profit improvement program" Wednesday, including a 15%
reduction in its current work force that will eliminate 1,300 jobs,
mostly in the first quarter of this year.</LD>
<LD>   How many of those layoffs would occur at its Santa Ana
headquarters was not known Wednesday, but a spokesman said the
company should have more information by the time it holds its
earnings forecast meeting next month.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the job cuts and cost savings will result from outsourcing
its computer services to IBM Corp. and Keane Inc. PacifiCare said the
restructuring would result in savings of $80 million to $90 million a
year.</LD>
<TE>   PacifiCare also raised its earnings forecast for 2002 to $3.55 to
$3.65 a share, including $1.60 from an accounting change related to
goodwill. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call expect
PacifiCare to earn $1.83, not including the accounting change.</TE>
<TE>   The company also announced an aggressive marketing campaign
designed to distinguish its products from those of competitors.</TE>
<TE>   A company spokesman also said that new health-care plans the
company expects to roll out this year may allow it to make new hires.</TE>
<TE>   Initial reaction on Wall Street appeared to be positive as
PacifiCare's stock price rose as high as $17.90 in after-hours
trading, up 12%, from its close of $16.08 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   "This is another example of how the [managed-care] industry is
under tremendous pressure from Wall Street to perform," said Kirby G.
Bosley, a principal at the William M. Mercer health-care consulting
firm. "Every health plan is looking for every opportunity to achieve
administrative efficiencies. They are undergoing a period of
self-examination and trying to define for themselves and for the
marketplace just who they are."</TE>
<TE>   PacifiCare is one of the nation's largest managed-care companies
and the biggest operator of Medicare health plans.</TE>
<TE>   Many observers said Wednesday that its moves are symptomatic of
the struggling managed-care industry and represent a general revolt
against tightly controlled care standards and low payments for the
care they do provide.</TE>
<TE>   "These companies are under tremendous pressure from [consumers],
from state legislators and Congress to help consumers get the care
they want," said William Pierskalla, a professor and former dean at
UCLA's Anderson business school. "And on the other side, health-care
providers are saying that they can't continue to contract for low
payments."</TE>
<TE>   PacifiCare has struggled to control increasing medical costs in
renegotiating contracts with doctors and hospitals in California to
reflect the true cost of care rather than the standard fixed monthly
payments for those services.</TE>
<TE>   They "face tough choices about which providers and which markets
they serve, particularly with regard to Medicare HMOs," Bosley said.</TE>
<TE>   Several Medicare HMOs faced considerable legislative heat last
month for some of those market choices. State Sen. Jackie Speier
(D-Hillsborough), chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Insurance,
accused them of "redlining" to avoid certain areas where patient
expenses are too high.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Nancy Monk, vice president of public affairs for
PacifiCare, denied the charges and blamed the federal government for
under-funding the Medicare HMO program.</TE>
<TE>   "We just can't afford it anymore," Monk told legislators. "We have
to cover what we can cover with the funding we've got."</TE>

<HD>S&amp;P Dividend Rate Fell in 2001 for 2nd Year</HD>
<DH>Investing: Payout for shareholders in the blue-chip index
drops 3.3%, the largest decline in 50 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. companies boosted cash dividends in December at a pace only
slightly off the year-ago level, but 2001 still turned out to be a
dismal year for dividends overall, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The total dividend rate on the blue-chip S&amp;P 500 index fell 3.3%
last year, the largest calendar-year decline since a 4.1% drop in
1951, S&amp;P said.</LD>
<LD>   The rate also had declined in 2000, by 2.5%. The back-to-back
decline in the dividend rate was the first since 1970-71, S&amp;P said.</LD>
<TE>   The drop in the dividend rate reflected fewer increases and more
dividend cuts and omissions by major companies. As profits plunged
with the recession more companies sought to conserve cash.</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P, which tracks 7,500 companies, said 1,326 dividend increases
were announced in 2001, down 11% from 1,496 hikes in 2000 and the
fewest since 1991.</TE>
<TE>   The number of dividend cuts announced came to 127, up 65% from 77
in 2000 and the greatest number since 1992. A total of 78 firms
omitted their dividends entirely, up from 60 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In December, however, 121 companies raised dividends, nearly
equaling the 124 increases announced in December 2000. Even so, the
number of dividend cuts for the month totaled 15, up from 10 a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Though more companies have opted to get stingier with dividends,
those that have continued to pay cash to shareholders have been
rewarded with better stock performance in general.</TE>
<TE>   In the S&amp;P 500, stocks that pay dividends fell an average of 0.1%
in 2001, while shares that don't pay dividends slumped 5.4%, on
average, S&amp;P said.</TE>
<TE>   The average annualized dividend yield of S&amp;P 500 stocks is about
1.36%.</TE>

<PH>ROSE BOWL: MIAMI (11-0) VS. NEBRASKA (11-1) / BCS TITLE
GAME--5 P.M., CHANNEL 7</PH>

<LD>It's still the Rose Bowl. Doesn't matter when they play it, what
school colors they paint on the field, or who presents it. As long as
they're playing in the big oval in that Pasadena canyon, it's still
the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   The more the bowl landscape shifted in the last decade, the more I
embraced the consistency of the Rose Bowl. Always on New Year's Day,
always starting in the afternoon, always the Pacific 10 vs. the Big
Ten, no goofy sponsor logos all over the field.</LD>
<LD>   I have covered all of the major bowl games, and nothing topped the
Rose Bowl on game day. I loved driving down the residential streets
of the Arroyo Seco during the Rose Parade, the world's greatest
traffic diversion. I loved looking out from the press box and seeing
the gorgeous backdrop of the San Gabriel Mountains. I loved that it
started in daylight and ended in darkness.</LD>
<TE>   But everything has to change at some point. If not, they'd still
be holding chariot races at the Rose Bowl instead of a football game.</TE>
<TE>   You can't be in favor of a playoff system and adamantly opposed to
tampering with Rose Bowl tradition. Not if you want the granddaddy to
stay in the loop.</TE>
<TE>   If you want to preserve the Rose Bowl, it has to stay relevant.
Don't let it drop off the scene like the Cotton Bowl. (Did you watch
the Cotton Bowl this year? Did you know which teams were in it? Did
you know it still existed?)</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl (now presented by AT&amp;T) can still play a role in a
playoff system, rotating with the Orange, Sugar and Fiesta bowls to
host a true national championship game.</TE>
<TE>   And the Rose Bowl can still be special.</TE>
<TE>   It has built up enough lore that it will always stand apart, the
same way there is Lambeau Field and then there are other NFL
stadiums. Don't you think it meant a lot to Tiger Woods that he won
the 2000 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach? The Chicago Cubs added lights and
luxury boxes to Wrigley Field, but it still feels like "the friendly
confines."</TE>
<TE>   Some forms always hold. Like Miami's trash-talking ways. After a
quiet week, Hurricane offensive line coach Art Kehoe stepped to the
microphone at a pep rally Tuesday and said, "We're going to run the
ball, and we're going to bring it right up the Big Red's [butt]!"</TE>
<TE>   Ah, tradition.</TE>
<TE>   But if steadfast rules can change, so can perspectives. After all,
the Rose Bowl has already been played on Jan. 2 during the dozen
times New Year's Day fell on a Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "The game is when it is," Miami Coach Larry Coker answered, when
asked about playing the big bowl game on Jan. 3. "It's getting to the
point now, you want play on the third. It's the last game of the
year."</TE>
<TE>   As I was growing up in Los Angeles, the Rose Bowl started to lose
importance to me. When you see it as the site of UCLA games, soccer
matches and swap meets, when you drive by it and fly over it in the
course of regular life, it becomes part of the backdrop. Like the
Eiffel Tower to Parisians.</TE>
<TE>   Going to college in the Midwest made me appreciate how much it
means. From 1,700 miles away, Pasadena is an exotic location.
Shangri-la.</TE>
<TE>   Big Ten coaches would play for a tie if it could guarantee the
conference title and a Rose Bowl berth, even if it cost them a shot
at a national championship. The Rose Bowl came first, because that's
what mattered the most.</TE>
<TE>   Other conferences and the major independents had their games--and
usually a better shot at playing for a championship. But deep inside,
I think, they were all a little envious that they couldn't play in
the Rose Bowl. Even the name sounds more desirable than a piece of
fruit or some sweetener.</TE>
<TE>   I stood on the field and watched Joe Paterno come out of the
tunnel and gaze around the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day, 1995. The
Nittany Lions had gone undefeated in their second season in the Big
Ten. Paterno had been at Penn State for 45 years, had seen just about
all college football had to offer, and yet he wore a look of wonder,
later calling the experience one of the best of his career.</TE>
<TE>   A Northwestern student once drove to L.A. from his summer
internship in Arizona, just so he could peer through the locked gates
of the stadium. He thought he'd never get another chance to see it.
Little did he know the Wildcats would make their storybook run to the
roses the next season.</TE>
<TE>   I'm a Northwestern alum myself; I was there the night Gary Barnett
first talked about "taking the Purple to Pasadena," and I was there
to see his dream come to fruition. I was glad that the Big Ten still
operated outside of the then-Bowl Alliance. There was something about
having that set destination that made that phrase become such a
mantra. "Taking the 'Cats to the championship game--wherever it
should happen to be," didn't have quite the same ring.</TE>
<TE>   I still have a few purple blades of grass I plucked from the end
zone on Jan. 1, 1996. It meant that much to me to have my school's
colors on that field.</TE>
<TE>   So now we have the orange and green of Miami and the red and white
of Nebraska. It's an especially jarring mix because orange and green
is such an ugly combination, and Nebraska is here by virtue of a
flawed BCS system.</TE>
<TE>   The Cornhuskers don't apologize for being invited, and they've
responded by giving the place its proper respect.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just so excited that my last game and my last playing day on
the field being a Nebraska quarterback is going to be in Pasadena at
the Rose Bowl," quarterback Eric Crouch said.</TE>
<TE>   What's so bad about letting other people get a chance to
experience the magic of the Rose Bowl?</TE>
<TE>   And there are positives surrounding the new time and date. In one
of my favorite Jim Murray columns, he blamed the unfailingly perfect
New Year's Day weather at the Rose Bowl for inspiring the masses in
the Midwest to pack up the Winnebagos and move to Southern
California. That won't happen this year. Now everyone else will find
out what we already know: L.A. can be pretty cold at night. Stay
where you are.</TE>
<TE>   You might choose to look at the calendar and see Jan. 3. I choose
to look at the stadium, to see the same place where all the memories
were made, the place that's still the granddaddy of them all.</TE>

<KH>NCAA GRADUATION RATES</KH>
<HD>Success, to Some Degree</HD>
<DH>Hurricanes, Cornhuskers Lag in Classroom, but Some Say
Numbers Misleading</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If graduation rates were critical to the bowl championship series,
neither Nebraska nor Miami would be playing in the Rose Bowl tonight.</LD>
<LD>   If this purely academic standard were paramount, the title game
might feature Duke and Northwestern. Or Rice and Stanford.</LD>
<LD>   Those teams customarily graduate more than 80% of their players,
according to a recent NCAA report. Yet, for the most part, they got
nowhere near the top of the football rankings this season.</LD>
<TE>   So thousands of fans in Pasadena and millions more watching on
television will see teams representing programs that had no such
success in the classroom. The Cornhuskers ranked 43rd among 111
Division I football programs with a graduation rate of 53%. The
Hurricanes finished 76th at 41%.</TE>
<TE>   "The subject of graduation rates needs to be raised every time we
have a big game like this," said Richard Lapchick, director emeritus
of the Center for the Study of Sport in Society at Northeastern
University. "It's an important issue."</TE>
<TE>   It is also a complex issue that pits reform-minded critics against
the athletic establishment, much of which argues that numbers don't
tell the whole story.</TE>
<TE>   The debate heated up last summer when an independent panel
recommended widespread changes to address "the widening chasm between
higher education's ideals and big-time college sports."</TE>
<TE>   The Knight Foundation Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics
noted that only 48% of Division I football players earn degrees. The
rate for African American players was 42%.</TE>
<TE>   The commission recommended that, by 2007, teams should be required
to graduate at least half of their players to qualify for postseason
play, a rule that would have excluded Miami from the Rose Bowl, no
matter how many games the Hurricanes had won.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not in the entertainment business; nor are we a minor
league for professional sports," Father Theodore Hesburgh, president
emeritus of Notre Dame and commission co-chairman, said in June.
"Your school is not worthy to be the champion of the country if
you're not educating your kids."</TE>
<TE>   That kind of talk irks coaches and administrators in athletic
departments across the nation. The NCAA has previously said that 58%
of student-athletes graduate, compared to 56% of all students.
Besides, many say, the numbers are misleading.</TE>
<TE>   Take Nebraska, for example. The Cornhuskers' 53% rate suggests
that one might look down the roster of 23 seniors and find that
roughly half of them won't finish school. In fact, only one is not on
track to graduate. And one already has graduated. Quarterback Eric
Crouch received his diploma last month. Another, tight end Tracey
Wistrom, is an Academic All-American majoring in secondary education
and mathematics.</TE>
<TE>   "I could go down the line and tell you story after story," said
Dennis Leblanc, associate athletic director for academic and student
services at the Lincoln campus.</TE>
<TE>   So why the low rating?</TE>
<TE>   Some players flunk out of school before their senior seasons. But
Leblanc and others say the figures are deceiving because the NCAA
uses limited information gathered by the U.S. Department of
Education.</TE>
<TE>   A player who leaves for any reason--homesickness, family
problems--counts as a negative, even if he is an A student or
eventually earns a degree elsewhere. Same goes for an athlete who
transfers because he cannot make the starting lineup, a common
occurrence at Nebraska and other major programs.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't graduate someone who's not here," Leblanc said. "If a kid
transfers to Penn State, I can't help him and he counts against us
anyway."</TE>
<TE>   At Miami, where nine of 13 seniors already have graduated and
offensive tackle Joaquin Gonzalez was nationally recognized for his
academic achievement, an administrator points to another gap in the
calculations. After a recent school year, four football players left
early to turn professional. Those defections hurt the percentage.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like a rate that is more reflective of students who leave
in good academic standing," assistant athletic director Tomas Jimenez
said.</TE>
<TE>   Jimenez is not alone. Years ago, quarterback Jeff Hostetler
transferred from Penn State to West Virginia, eventually graduating
as an Academic All-American. Penn State complained about his counting
against its rate and the now-defunct College Football Assn. devised a
measurement that accounts for student-athletes who transfer and
eventually earn their degrees.</TE>
<TE>   The formula also gives credit for players who come to a program
after two years in junior college, a group the NCAA ignores. This
method--now used by the American Football Coaches Assn.--puts the
Division I football graduation rate at around 60%.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel this gives a more balanced view," AFCA official Chuck
Neinas said.</TE>
<TE>   Critics are not impressed.</TE>
<TE>   The Knight Commission says student-athletes should be compared not
to the general student body but to a smaller subset that, like
athletes, enrolls immediately after high school. That group graduates
at a rate of about 75%. Lapchick believes football players should do
even better because they receive special tutoring.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike the general population, we're bringing these students to a
college campus to perform services for the school," said Lapchick,
who, come September, will chair the new DeVos Sports Business
Management Program at the University of Central Florida. "We owe them
a little bit more."</TE>
<TE>   Players acknowledge they have advantages.</TE>
<TE>   ''We have so much academic support with tutors and advisors and
things like that, you almost have to try not to do well," Nebraska's
Wistrom said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some of the best teams in the nation rank among the worst when
it comes to graduation rates, according to the Chronicle of Higher
Education, which analyzes NCAA statistics each year. The most recent
reports showed only 36% of Oklahoma players finished school. Georgia
Tech, Ohio State and Texas A&amp;M had 33% rates.</TE>
<TE>   (Local schools fared better: USC ranked 15th in the nation at 65%
and UCLA was 27th with a 59% rate.)</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, critics point to instances of football programs
altering grades, doing schoolwork for players--as occurred recently
at USC--or guiding athletes into easy classes.</TE>
<TE>   "The historic and vital link between playing field and classroom
is all but severed in many institutions," the Knight Commission
stated.</TE>
<TE>   Miami is fighting an image problem that dates to the 1980s, when
football players came under scrutiny for alleged brushes with campus
police, illegal use of telephone access cards and improper use of
automobiles. The Hurricanes are especially sensitive about their
academic reputation since Donna Shalala, former secretary of Health
and Human Services, became president.</TE>
<TE>   At Nebraska, administrators also worry that the public dismisses
the school as a football factory.</TE>
<TE>   Leblanc said, "That's one of those arguments, like the BCS, you
can't win."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, Lapchick cites the Cornhuskers as an example of a team
working to make things right. The athletic department tries to keep
players in school after their football careers have ended. Often,
such players end up counting against the rate because they don't
finish in the required six years but, Leblanc said, "They are success
stories."</TE>
<TE>   The Knight Commission and others have applauded such efforts and
are hoping that stricter NCAA eligibility standards, enacted in the
mid-1990s, will boost academic success in coming years. But they see
much room for improvement.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to recommending that graduation rates be a
prerequisite for postseason play, the commission stated that if a
player flunks out, his scholarship should be frozen until his
freshman class graduates. The panel also would like to see the NCAA
mainstream student-athletes, putting them through the same admissions
processes as other students.</TE>
<TE>   That raises the prickly question of whether student-athletes with
poor high school records should be given chances at a college
education.</TE>
<TE>   "It might be, the world's most brilliant violinist has lousy
SATs," Shalala said. "I want to be careful about singling out
student-athletes when universities are doing all sorts of things ...
for other kinds of admits."</TE>
<TE>   But Shalala does not want such admissions to come at the expense
of academic standards. And though Jimenez, her assistant athletic
director, thinks the Miami football team gets an unfair rap, he sees
a benefit to public scrutiny of his and other teams.</TE>
<TE>   Graduation rates are something to keep in mind, he believes, when
people are watching the Rose Bowl tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "It's OK to have public pressure," he said. "That pushes us to do
the right thing. That's a big part of changing the reputation."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If you were pitching tonight's Rose Bowl game between Miami and
Nebraska in Hollywood, you'd cut straight to the movie-trailer hook:
Slick versus Hick, Fast Planes versus Flat Plains, Back Talk versus
Back Hoe, Urban versus Cowboy.</LD>
<LD>   Truth is, these schools are different: culturally, offensively,
geographically and philosophically.</LD>
<LD>   You know how, in time, some people start looking like their dogs?</LD>
<TE>   Well, the same might be said about Nebraska and Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska is conservative, corn-fed, religious and rural--and so is
its football.</TE>
<TE>   Miami is diverse, spicy, sun-soaked and cosmopolitan--and so is
its football.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska's style reflects a pioneer people who settled the
territory yards at a time; Miami's attack looks more like Saturday
night in South Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Price, professor of theology at Whittier College and author of
the book "From Season to Season: Sports as American Religion," has
long been fascinated by the cultural dynamic of the Miami-Nebraska
series.</TE>
<TE>   "There is something about football itself that appeals to the
frontier myth, especially in a landscape like Nebraska, in ways not
as significant as, say, Miami," Price said. "In Nebraska, the game
takes on more mythic significance."</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska (11-1) and Miami (11-0), which will play for first place
in the bowl championship series, have won or shared seven national
titles since 1983.</TE>
<TE>   This pairing has been college football's longest running morality
play--White Hat versus Black, or so they made us think in serials
narrated by Keith Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's game, of course, has a completely modern and independent
relevance and will be contested by players conceived at roughly the
time this rivalry was born.</TE>
<TE>   Miami, led by first-year Coach Larry Coker, is out to stamp out
the raging BCS controversy with victory and claim an undisputed
national title.</TE>
<TE>   It would cap a remarkable rookie season for the 53-year-old Coker,
a lifetime assistant who inherited the Hurricanes this season when
Butch Davis left to coach the Cleveland Browns.</TE>
<TE>   For Coker, who grew up in Oklahoma, "literally at the end of a
dirt road," victory becomes validation for perseverance.</TE>
<TE>   "I still remember watching the Rose Bowl growing up," Coker said
this week. "At halftime, I would go out. My mother actually planted
rose bushes, not quite as attractive as some of the roses you have
around Pasadena this week, but I had my football and would go out and
play. Then I'd come back in and watch the Rose Bowl. To dream I would
ever be here in any capacity was out of the question."</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska is out to prove it even belongs in the game, a less
convincing argument since Oregon's 38-16 thrashing of Colorado in
Tuesday's Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "People will look at that as a measuring stick, and they should,"
Nebraska Coach Frank Solich said. "But it's not the only measuring
stick."</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska, although ranking only fourth in both the writers' and
coaches' polls, finished second behind Miami in the BCS standings, a
system devised in 1998 ostensibly to resolve poll disputes.</TE>
<TE>   At the final finding, however, Nebraska nipped Colorado and Oregon
in the BCS to win a golden ticket to Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   This continues to be interesting, given that Colorado defeated
Nebraska, 62-36, and more so now that Oregon has put the wallop on
Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   A Nebraska victory over Miami all but assures that Oregon, No. 2
in both subjective polls, will earn a split of the national title by
winning the Associated Press crown.</TE>
<TE>   It would seem to most a just result, given that Oregon beat by 22
points the team, Colorado, that defeated Nebraska by 26.</TE>
<TE>   By contract and by contrast, however, the voting coaches must
award the Sears Trophy to the Miami-Nebraska winner. If that is
Nebraska, it will mean the coaches must jump their No. 4 team over
their No. 2, Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska, understandably, is tired of being the punching bag in
this debate.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I know, the BCS was designed to have one national
champion," Nebraska safety Dion Booker argued. "If we win, we deserve
to be the champion. There should be no split, it should be Miami or
Nebraska as the all-out champion."</TE>
<TE>   It is thoroughly fitting that Miami and Nebraska should be
hammering out a season's final details on center stage.</TE>
<TE>   You cannot speak of tonight's game without paying homage to its
historical context, blithely ignoring the diversely different roads
each school took to national prominence, or how each used the other
to reach its political objectives.</TE>
<TE>   Miami and Nebraska met three times between 1984 and 1992, all at
the Orange Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Black Bart (Miami) got the girl each time.</TE>
<TE>   The business of myth-making, however, is never, in reality, as cut
and dried as good versus evil. Miami was not as Snidely
Whiplash-diabolical as its image portrayed, and Nebraska has known
its share of bail bondsmen.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, delineating the differences for the purposes of art made
masterpiece football theater.</TE>
<TE>   The legends of both modern-day dynasties were forged after the
1983 season--in that majestic 1984 Orange Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   It remains in a time capsule, one of the most engaging contests
the college game has yet to offer, a South Florida thriller in which
Miami claimed its first national title and Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne
became, in defeat, a laconic icon.</TE>
<TE>   Remember? Nebraska scored with less than a minute remaining to cut
Miami's lead to 31-30.</TE>
<TE>   There was no overtime then, so Osborne had a choice to make, with
America watching.</TE>
<TE>   He could elect to tie the score with an extra point and all but
assure a national title for Nebraska, or try to win the game outright
with a two-point conversion.</TE>
<TE>   Osborne did not hesitate in going for the win and valiantly
accepted defeat when the two-point attempt failed.</TE>
<TE>   A judgment call had cost Nebraska the title and handed it to
Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a game that almost looked like it was preordained by a
higher authority," former Miami coach Howard Schnellenberger, said.</TE>
<TE>   To this day, Schnellenberger hails Osborne's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "He made the right decision for himself and for his team, even
though it didn't work out," Schnellenberger said. "I think everyone
respects him and his team very much for having the courage to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska's Solich, then a young assistant under Osborne, said the
decision to go for two was made long before the call had to be made.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked at a lot of things, and one of them was the personality
of our football team," Solich said. "Would they want us to line up
and tie a football game? Or would they want us to line up and attempt
to win a football game? It was not as tough a decision as maybe a lot
of people thought at the moment because we knew what we were wanting
to do."</TE>
<TE>   The moment defined Osborne as a football hero, probably hastened
Schnellenberger's win-and-out departure to head the Miami franchise
of the United States Football League, and crystallized a rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   The problem for Osborne was, the 1984 game unleashed Miami as a
national power, pretty much at Nebraska's expense.</TE>
<TE>   Osborne trudged through the 1980s and early 1990s, still seeking
his first championship, watching the gap between his program and
Miami's widen.</TE>
<TE>   In the Orange Bowl after the 1988 season, Miami defeated Nebraska,
23-3. At the end of the 1991 season, Miami claimed its fourth
national title with a 22-0 victory over the Cornhuskers.</TE>
<TE>   Significantly, it was the magnitude of those losses that brought
Osborne to an understanding. Despite fundamental differences of
philosophy and approach, Nebraska had to become more like Miami, not
less.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned a great deal," Solich said of the defeats against
Miami. "We learned you'd better have speed on your football team if
you wanted to win big games. We certainly tried to learn from our
losses to Miami, and I think we did."</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska changed the way it recruited, took more chances on
players, even altered its defense to slow down Miami's passing
attack.</TE>
<TE>   In the Orange Bowl after the 1994 season, the lessons paid off as
Nebraska finally vanquished Miami, 24-17, with Osborne winning the
first of his three national titles.</TE>
<TE>   That Nebraska and Miami should battle again tonight is no
surprise. The surprise is how the schools have evolved since 1983.
Differences remain, but Miami and Nebraska seem to share a more
common ground.</TE>
<TE>   In stark contrast to decades past, Miami's image as a renegade
program has largely waned. Gone are the Army fatigues, trash talk and
stereotypes.</TE>
<TE>   Miami offensive tackle Joaquin Gonzalez chose Miami over Harvard.</TE>
<TE>   "We've taken this program from the dumps to the pinnacle of
college football, and we've done it the right way--with character,"
Gonzalez said. "I mean, when in the past year have you heard anything
absurd happen with Miami football?"</TE>
<TE>   It was Nebraska that made news last spring and summer with a
series of player arrests.</TE>
<TE>   In the 18 years since Miami and Nebraska started this ongoing saga
at the Orange Bowl, both schools have evolved, become more
representative of America's melting pot.</TE>
<TE>   "American Gothic" versus "Scarface" is a tougher sell these days.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska boasts starting players from Canada, California and
Hawaii. Miami has a strong safety from Piscataway, N.J., a right
guard from Mountaintop, Pa., a tight end from Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Some things, though, don't change. On the field, Miami will think
pass first, Nebraska will run. Nebraska is about option, Miami about
options.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, with Miami and Nebraska, it's OK to have it both ways.</TE>
<TE>   So, welcome the changes and savor the differences.</TE>

<LD>   Fire up the motor home, toss in a few kegs, hit the highway and
follow your team out of town for the weekend?</LD>
<LD>   That's child's play for Maggie Dorsey, who moved across the
country to watch her child play. She fired up the motor home, hitched
a Honda Civic to the back, tossed in a dog, two newborn cats and her
computer, and hit the highway to follow her younger son and his
college football team for two months.</LD>
<TE>   Ken Dorsey could have played at California, five miles from his
home in Orinda. Instead, he picked Miami, 3,000 and five miles away.
So Mom drove for five days, stopping every three or four hours to
bottle-feed the kittens, lumbering along Interstate 40 at 12 miles
per gallon, passing Flagstaff, Ariz.; Gallup, N.M.; Amarillo, Texas,
and Clinton, Okla.</TE>
<TE>   She set up camp, literally, 20 minutes south of the Miami campus,
using the 30-foot motor home as her office. She drove around town,
and back to her space in the campground, in the Honda. And she never
saw her son lose a game.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Dorsey, finalist for the Heisman Trophy and quarterback of the
only undefeated college team in America, chuckles at the antics of
his mother.</TE>
<TE>   "She is a crazy, crazy woman," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He says it with love, and with pride. When he returns to campus
after the Rose Bowl, she will not be there.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to miss her," he said. "I'm thinking I didn't
spend enough time with her."</TE>
<TE>   Maggie and Tom Dorsey, the father of her boys,
Ken and older brother Adam, divorced long ago; the boys remain close
to both parents. Maggie runs her own business, developing data bases
that help emergency response crews locate the precise spot a 911 call
was placed. So long as she packs her computer, modem and cell phone,
her business is portable.</TE>
<TE>   Adam attends Florida State, defiantly wearing Miami gear around
campus and driving eight hours, each way, from Tallahassee to
Hurricane home games. And for one month in 2000 and two months this
season, Maggie Dorsey followed her sons and moved her life to
Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "Their whole family situation is like a storybook," said Dorsey's
roommate, center Brett Romberg. "Everybody is so loving. The mother
is so nurturing. The brother drives down for every game.</TE>
<TE>   "They talk to each other like they're on a TV show. It's like,
'Oh, hi, Kenny, how are you doing?' and 'Hi, Mom, how's it going?
You're awesome!'</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's not fake, but if you were an outside party you'd be,
like, 'Are you sure that's the way they act?'"</TE>
<TE>   Must be. Maggie stopped by to watch practice once or twice a week,
to chat with Ken's teammates and coaches. One night during the week,
and sometimes two, she shared dinner and a movie with Ken--and his
girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Time out: From the time the first zit appears, most boys are
embarrassed to be spotted with a parent. Most boys would be mortified
if they went away to college and their mothers followed them.</TE>
<TE>   "Even in middle school, I'd drive up to school and my boys would
let me give them a kiss, and their friends would be standing right
there," Maggie Dorsey said. "It would never faze them. They're very,
very affectionate. They're so loving. I'm just so fortunate.</TE>
<TE>   "Kenny has no problem. I don't take advantage of him. I give him
and his girlfriend plenty of space."</TE>
<TE>   Not long after the Miami coaches wooed Maggie Dorsey's younger son
away from USC and Cal, they wondered whether they had made a mistake.
The kid was exceptionally thin, but they could send him to the weight
room to work on that. He was exceptionally quiet too, and they
weren't sure what they could do about that.</TE>
<TE>   "We were worried about him," Coach Larry Coker said. "We thought
this guy may not be tough enough to take charge. Boy, how wrong we
were."</TE>
<TE>   The leadership and competitive fire emerged slowly, and not always
on the practice field or in the weight room, where the 6-foot-5
Dorsey bulked up to 200 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Running back Clinton Portis noticed how intensely Dorsey competed
at video games, how he couldn't play just for fun.</TE>
<TE>   "He always gets whipped," Portis said. "There are some video game
fanatics around here. He comes out with a game plan, even on video
games. But you can't execute a game plan on the video game, so
he can't beat me."</TE>
<TE>   Said Dorsey, "I hate losing, more than anything. To go out
and play those guys is the most miserable thing, because I think I'm
doing well but I'm really not, and they end up killing me. It's such
a nightmare."</TE>
<TE>   Cornerback Mike Rumph was astonished when, during a pickup
basketball game, the supposedly mild-mannered quarterback was knocked
to the ground, got up and threw the ball at the player who committed
what Rumph thought was a meaningless foul in a meaningless game.</TE>
<TE>   "I was like, 'That's the kind of quarterback we need,'" he said.
"He'll get in your face. He ain't no scaredy-cat in the face of
linemen."</TE>
<TE>   In November, in his second full season as the starting quarterback
and with the Hurricanes two victories away from the Rose Bowl, Dorsey
staged his own little leadership seminar. The Hurricanes had lost
their spot in the national championship game last season when they
were beaten at Washington, and now the Huskies were headed to Miami.
In the only other meeting between the schools, in 1994, the Huskies
had strutted into the Orange Bowl and ended Miami's NCAA-record home
winning streak at 58 games.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference five days before the game, with cameras and
microphones transmitting his every word across the country, Dorsey
ripped the Huskies for an alleged blizzard of cheap shots and late
hits in last season's game.</TE>
<TE>   What was this? The polite and soft-spoken young man was talking
smack, calling out the opposing team for all the world to hear,
making himself an inviting target in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, whatever works: Miami 65, Washington 7.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Dorsey sheepishly apologized for his comments.
Today, he readily admits those words were meant for the ears of his
teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely said those things for a reason," he said. "To get
guys going and let everybody understand how big a rivalry Miami and
Washington was. We've only played two games besides that, but they
were an intense two games. I wanted to make sure everybody realized
it was going to be tough and fire guys up."</TE>
<TE>   As the Miami quarterback, Dorsey follows in an illustrious
line--George Mira, Jim Kelly, Bernie Kosar and Heisman Trophy winners
Vinny Testaverde and Gino Torretta. The Miami quarterback still wins,
but he no longer throws for 3,000 yards in a season, as Torretta did
twice, as Testaverde and Kosar did, as Craig Erickson and Steve Walsh
did.</TE>
<TE>   Under Butch Davis, who replaced Dennis Erickson as coach in 1995,
and under Coker, promoted from offensive coordinator when Davis left
for the Cleveland Browns, the Hurricanes diversified their offense.
No longer is the quarterback the undisputed glamour boy and the
running back strictly a bit player.</TE>
<TE>   In the seven seasons since Davis and Coker restructured the
offense, Miami running backs have rushed for 1,000 yards five times,
among them Portis this season. In the previous 70 seasons
of Miami football, only once had a player rushed for 1,000
yards--Ottis Anderson in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Said Coker, "I tell our recruits, if you want to come to our school
and become a passing genius, you're probably going to the wrong school."
   Dorsey threw for 2,652 yards this season. Florida's Rex Grossman,
another Heisman finalist, threw for 3,896, averaging 354 yards a
game, tops in the nation and better than Dorsey's career-best 344.
Insert Dorsey for Grossman into Steve Spurrier's pass-happy Florida
offense, and Coker insists Dorsey could produce the same numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd throw for a million yards and a million touchdowns, and he'd
win a lot of games," Coker said. "It wouldn't be any different. Look
at what's happened at Florida; has it changed since Coach Spurrier
has been there? Look at all these guys and what they've done. They've
all thrown for a million yards. That's the system they have."</TE>
<TE>   As Torretta could tell you, or as Florida's Heisman Trophy winner
Danny Wuerffel could attest, throwing for a million yards in college
does not necessarily translate to NFL success.</TE>
<TE>   Said Dorsey, "It definitely is a luxury to be able to go out and
wing it. It would be nice. At the same time, there's always that one
game where you need that run game to be able to win. There are games
where I've had bad games but the run game has been there, and vice
versa. When it's all clicking, that's when we have a great day. The
biggest thing to me is winning. That's why I came here, to win
games."</TE>
<TE>   That he does. As the Hurricanes' starting quarterback, Dorsey is
26-1. If Miami wins the Rose Bowl game, and the national championship
with it, Dorsey might be tempted to skip his senior season and try
his luck in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still a decision that I have to think about, and talk to my
family about, but right now I'm set on coming back," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He'd better. Maggie Dorsey plans on going back to Miami next fall.
And staying for the entire season.</TE>

<HD>No Doubt About It</HD>
<DH>Crouch Ends Questions With Superb Season</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LINCOLN, Neb.</DL>
<LD>Don't blame yourself if you've bet against Eric Crouch before.
Happens all the time. Recruiters misjudged his ability and desire to
play quarterback. His coaching staff once made the wrong call on him.
He has even had his own moments of doubt, some as recently as six
weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   But whenever he seems to be cornered or trapped, he leaves the
doubters grabbing at a whole lot of nothing, like those Missouri
defenders he played like fools in that 95-yard run.</LD>
<LD>   You thought he was done after the crushing in Colorado. The
Buffalo fans chanted, "No more Heisman!" The Rose Bowl looked
impossible.</LD>
<TE>   Truth be told, Crouch was thinking the same way.</TE>
<TE>   "I counted it out," he said. "I counted both of them out."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Frank Solich gathered the team for a meeting. He broke it
down, told his players that to get to the Rose Bowl, they would
probably need four teams to lose: Oklahoma, Florida, Tennessee and
Texas.</TE>
<TE>   And for Crouch to win the Heisman, he would have to overcome a
traditional voter bias against option quarterbacks.</TE>
<TE>   But there he was Dec. 8, standing in the New York Marriott Marquis
with the straight-arming statue in his hands.</TE>
<TE>   And here he is, getting ready for the Rose Bowl game in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   How did he reach these destinations?</TE>
<TE>   First of all, take a look at those fleet feet.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got as much speed as, I think, any quarterback in the
country," Solich said.</TE>
<TE>   Second, there's his strength, which allows him to break tackles.</TE>
<TE>   "We played Iowa and he just ran the guy over to get in the end
zone," tight end Tracey Wistrom said.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are his juke moves.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nothing I work on, I just react," Crouch said. "That's the
consequences sometimes of reacting to certain things. Sometimes I
make people miss and it looks bad. Sometimes I get hit real hard and
I'm the one that looks bad."</TE>
<TE>   But there's one attribute that keeps popping up when discussing
Crouch.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess as much as anything, we've loved his toughness," Solich
said. "He's been able to take every snap and stay on the field for
us. If it wasn't for that toughness, the strength and the speed, he
wouldn't be able to demonstrate them. They'd take him out of games,
because he's taken some great shots."</TE>
<TE>   Off the field, there's another element to Crouch that allows him
to put the whole package together: time management. He has more
organizational skills than a Palm Pilot. He handles practices,
weightlifting, film study and never-ending interview requests. He has
a 2-year-old daughter, Alexi, with his longtime girlfriend, Nicole
Kousgaard. Fans hound him, to the point he recently was devoting two
hours a day to signing autographs. You'd think his signature was the
most valuable thing in Nebraska, next to Warren Buffett's stock
portfolio. He came back from the postseason awards tour just in time
for final exams, then graduation, with in-pad practices in between.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a father," Crouch said, running down his personal list.
"That's big. That would be No. 1 for me.</TE>
<TE>   "I've come to put some closure on school, which is real exciting.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, family and football. I'm really focused on this
championship game here. It's been a lifetime dream. Nebraska's been
in a lot of national championship games. I've been born and raised
here, so I got to watch and I got to see them. Now that I'm in the
middle of it, it means a lot more. It's really a priority."</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska football wasn't always his dream. His football fantasies
revolved around the NFL and his favorite player, John Elway--he wears
Elway's No. 7. Then in his sophomore year at Millard North High in
Omaha, he received a recruiting letter from Nebraska, and something
about that red and white stationery got him.</TE>
<TE>   "Then the letters started coming, and it looked like I could get a
scholarship and my school paid for," Crouch said. "I was really
relieved for my family."</TE>
<TE>   But any school that wanted him to play anything but quarterback
was crossed off the list. That included Notre Dame. Crouch chose
Nebraska, but before the start of his sophomore year, Solich made
Bobby Newcombe the No. 1 quarterback. Crouch retreated to Omaha and
pondered his future, ready to call it quits.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really disappointed," he said. "I didn't think I was going
to be contributing to the team as much as I wanted.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I was a durable guy and I could win football games
for us. I felt like I could outplay [Newcombe]. I felt like I wasn't
getting a fair shake.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's really a time in everyone's life when people
remove themselves from what's going on and say, 'Is this what I want
to do?' Really, that's what I did."</TE>
<TE>   Solich went to Omaha and had to make a recruiting pitch to Crouch
all over again.</TE>
<TE>   "It was that we understand how talented he is," Solich said, "and
we're going to use that talent here and that we were going to make
sure that he was a vital part of this offense ... regardless of where
he lined up. And that we would not take him out of still competing
for the quarterback job."</TE>
<TE>   Crouch said he trusted Solich. So he came back and played wide
receiver. He tried his hand at returning punts and kickoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'That's fine,'" Crouch said. "'I'll go in there and prove
myself. I've got some frustration and some things to prove. I want to
prove to this country, this program, that I'm a better player. I want
to be in a position to help this team out.'"</TE>
<TE>   And then, in the second game of the season, Newcombe got hurt and
Crouch got his chance. With particular pride he says, "I never missed
a snap since then."</TE>
<TE>   He has rushed for 3,434 yards and 59 touchdowns, an NCAA record
for quarterbacks. This season, he rushed for 1,115 yards and 18
touchdowns and passed for 1,510 yards and seven touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Usually all of that running doesn't impress the Heisman voters.
They usually vote for running backs or passing quarterbacks.
Nebraska's two previous Heisman winners, Johnny Rodgers and Mike
Rozier, were running backs. The best previous finish for a Nebraska
quarterback was in 1995, when Tommie Frazier was runner-up to Ohio
State's Eddie George.</TE>
<TE>   It's not one of the glamorous positions in sport. The Nebraska
quarterback is often viewed as nothing more than a conduit, someone
to get the ball to the running backs so they can run behind that
massive offensive line.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our quarterbacks should be ... more respected," said
Nebraska quarterback coach Turner Gill, a former Cornhusker
quarterback himself.</TE>
<TE>   "We ask them to run the football, we ask them to throw the
football, and we ask them to read defenses. We ask them to do maybe
one more phase of the quarterback play than most people."</TE>
<TE>   Enough Heisman voters--barely--gave Crouch the respect to beat out
a pack of quarterbacks with glossier stats, including Florida's Rex
Grossman, Miami's Ken Dorsey and Oregon's Joey Harrington.</TE>
<TE>   You know who got it right, who believed in Crouch all along? His
mother. Don't moms always get it right?</TE>
<TE>   Susan Sanchez wrote an open letter to Crouch that appeared in the
Lincoln Journal Star the week before the Heisman ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "From the very beginning you made it easy to teach; right from
wrong, compassion instead of judgmentalism, hard work instead of
laziness, and accountability for your actions," she wrote. "Since
then, you have taken those tools and have defined yourself, exceeding
all my expectations. You are a man with confidence and without ego, a
self-motivator and a true leader....</TE>
<TE>   "Your talents at playing football have given you great
opportunities in your life. Yet, it is because of the man that you
are on the inside that you have that edge that makes you the catalyst
of your team and the best college football player in the nation."</TE>
<TE>   She was right. Now, do you still want to bet against Crouch ... or
his mom?</TE>

<HD>Irvine Co., Indians Divided by a Wall Carving</HD>
<DH>Development: The tiny image in a San Joaquin Hills cave is sacred
to some, but homes are planned for the site.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The historical and religious significance of a tiny, ancient wall
carving that may be bulldozed for 2,500 homes has prompted growing debate
between local American Indian groups and the Irvine Co.</LD>
<LD>   The carving is little more than a doodle, according to archeologists
who have seen it--a wavy line about 4 inches long with a circle at one
end. It was cut into the wall of a shallow cave by local Indians almost
2,000 years ago on Irvine Co. land near the Turtle Rock community.</LD>
<LD>   Company officials and archeologists have invited local tribal
representatives to view it and submit ideas for its fate. But they say
there are far larger, more significant finds that will be preserved in
the area.</LD>
<TE>   Local Native American groups, however, say the site and others like it
are sacred grounds that should be left intact.</TE>
<TE>   "The Turtle Rock area is considered one of the more sacred areas, and
I would imagine these sites could be tied to some of our major villages,"
said Dameon Shilo, chairman of the Juaneno Band of Mission Indians.</TE>
<TE>   The hollow with the carving is one of nine containing Indian artifacts
that dot 1,600 acres of rugged land in Irvine at the foot of the San
Joaquin Hills. Seven will be preserved on roughly 1,000 acres of open
land between the San Joaquin Hills toll road and Shady Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining two, which sit on opposite sides of an unnamed creek,
are in the middle of an area where the Irvine Co. has approvals to build
the homes.</TE>
<TE>   One of the sites will be demolished. Numerous archeologists agree that
the crushed shells and chipped stone inside tell little about the Native
Americans who used it. The site has been documented, as required by law,
and archeologists will monitor demolition in case other artifacts hidden
in the soil are turned up. If so, any significant artifacts will be
removed.</TE>
<TE>   The other cave contains the wall carving that some consider a valuable
archeological find.</TE>
<TE>   While such cave drawings or carvings exist throughout Southern
California, the debate over this one centers on whether every fragment
can, or should, be preserved to maintain historic and cultural links.</TE>
<TE>   The floor of the cave containing the small etching is thick with
midden--a dark, greasy soil mixed with shells, plant material and chipped
stone. Archeologists say the midden shows that tribes probably ate meals
here, perhaps as long as 1,700 years ago. The chipped stone suggests that
tribal members also fashioned their arrowheads in the rock shelter.</TE>
<TE>   Archeologists say the carving, like other etchings found in caves
around the county, holds clues to ancient civilizations that roamed the
area--some dating back thousands of years before Jesus' time.</TE>
<TE>   The language of the walls--the carvings and drawings--is unknown, and
experts say they can only guess at the meaning. Some images could have
served as navigational tools, and some could have religious or ceremonial
connotations. But experts say information can be gleaned from them.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the site is important and still has a lot of information
in it," said Pamela Maxwell, an archeologist with the Army Corps of
Engineers who examined the cave. "It can tell us what was going on at
that time. But ultimately, it's the Irvine Co.'s property, and we cannot
legally demand that they save it."</TE>
<TE>   Under the California Environmental Quality Act and the National
Historic Preservation Act, developers are required to study the
significance of archeological sites. While preservation is encouraged, it
isn't mandatory. The developer can build on the site, provided the
artifacts and other important information are documented in some way.</TE>
<TE>   But to members of the Juaneno and Gabrielino/Tongva tribes, whose
ancestors inhabited the area, the value of the rock shelters goes beyond
scientific worth. They are sacred and should be preserved--no matter how
insignificant the artifacts may appear.</TE>
<TE>   "This is part of our history; it is tied to our culture," Shilo said.</TE>
<TE>Documentation Isn't Enough, Indians Say</TE>
<TE>   Paul Apodaca, a Chapman University professor and an expert in Native
American studies, cautions against tampering with historic sites--no
matter how small they might be.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not acceptable to destroy the artifacts of history, even if they
are documented on paper," said Apodaca, a Native American. "Later
generations can always question whether that documentation is accurate or
even true."</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Co. generally favors preservation but believes it can be
taken to an extreme, said Steve Letterly, vice president of environmental
permitting.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point, these groups will have to decide what's important to
preserve," said Steve Conkling, an archeologist hired by the Irvine Co.
to study the cave.</TE>
<TE>   If the cave, known to bureaucrats as ORA-269, is destroyed, it
wouldn't be the first time the Irvine Co. has bulldozed an ancient Native
American site. In 1995 and 1996, the company unearthed about 600 human
burial sites and thousands of artifacts estimated to be 4,000 to 9,500
years old. The excavation was done to make way for 149 luxury homes in
the Harbor Cove community above Newport Beach's Back Bay.</TE>
<TE>   The bones later were reburied by local tribes, and artifacts were
preserved off-site, as dictated by state and federal laws. But some
experts, including one from the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in
Washington, decried destruction of the site.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, however, Irvine Co. officials say there are caves more
intriguing than this that are to be preserved. One, believed to have been
used about 3,000 years ago, sits atop a hill overlooking Upper Newport
Bay. Inside the cavern is a carving of a rattlesnake that spans the
interior.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the most important sites in the San Joaquin Hills, if
not the whole county," Conkling said. "It can tell us how the culture
changed over time."</TE>
<TE>Irvine Co. Says Such Caves Are Common</TE>
<TE>   Archeologists believe that that site was used by tribes for thousands
of years. Because of its location, Conkling said, it may have been a
tribal meeting place.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Co. officials say they have gone to great lengths to preserve
that and the other most significant sites.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why you have a 1,600-acre project area with 1,009 acres
preserved in open space," Letterly said. "That's where seven of these
sites are."</TE>
<TE>   But, Letterly said, shelters and caves like these are not uncommon.
There are 1,500 of them in Orange County, according to state records.</TE>
<TE>   "If you took any 1,600 acres along the San Joaquin Hills, there's a
good chance you would find more resources," Letterly said.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Co. officials have invited several local tribes to tour the
sites and offer suggestions for preservation, or alternatives if the
company decides to level the cave.</TE>
<TE>   Options could include taking archival photos, making a relief of the
etching or removing the portion of the rock on which it appears, Conkling
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anything is off the table at this point," Conkling
said. "But there's a variety of things you can do. . . . What's important
is getting together with these groups and figuring out how we can capture
the value of what's being affected."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the company has heard from three groups, including Anthony
Morales, who chairs the Gabrielino/Tongva Tribal Council in San Gabriel.</TE>
<TE>   Morales would like to see all nine caves, including this one, remain
intact. He said the Irvine Co. may be overlooking the cultural
significance of the entire project area.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me with that many sites, it could have been a gathering
place or even a village," Morales said. "You have nine recorded sites,
and that to me is indicative that there was a living habitat there."</TE>
<TE>   Getting everyone to agree on a plan could be difficult, said Rob Wood,
an environmental specialist with the Native American Heritage Commission
in Sacramento. A small etching in a rock might not seem important to
some, but it could hold a lot of meaning to the descendants of the tribe
that put it there.</TE>
<TE>   "These sites are extremely significant from a religious and cultural
standpoint," Wood said. "Because California is an area under constant
development, these sites disappear all the time. They're a finite
resource, and people will fight very hard to ensure these sites are
preserved."</TE>

<HD>Veterans Group Hopes to Convert Tustin Hangar Into an Interactive
War Museum</HD>
<DH>Military: Project at the closed Marine base would chronicle life in
wartime. Supervisors agree to study the idea.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The cavernous hangars at the deserted Tustin Marine base--historic
leftovers from another era--are a planner's challenge.</LD>
<LD>   Eighteen stories high, the structures are so enormous that blimps--as
many as six at a time--once were housed inside. The hangars are now
historic sites. They also are empty, except for pigeons that flap through
the airy buildings.</LD>
<LD>   So what do you do with a World War II blimp hangar? Thoughts vary. One
idea: a movie sound stage. Another suggestion calls for college
classrooms and still another, a homeless shelter.</LD>
<TE>   Bill Mannes, a war veteran, sees a military museum.</TE>
<TE>   Mannes is president of the United Veterans Organization, a group that
wants to convert the northern hangar into a military museum with exhibits
that chronicle life in wartime and pay homage to the county's 250,000
veterans. So far, though, Orange County supervisors have agreed only to
study the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that there's a reawakening of interest in the
military services," Mannes said. "Just look around the county and see how
many homes are flying U.S. flags and how many people are attending
veterans events. Something like this would help keep that feeling of
patriotism going."</TE>
<TE>   The hangar, according to plans, would be filled with thousands of
items donated by about 40 private collectors: planes, tanks, trucks,
Jeeps, uniforms and photographs.</TE>
<TE>   Museum organizers have already received $2 million worth of vintage
tanks, landing craft, uniforms and other equipment that was restored for
the movie "Windtalkers," a recently completed Nicolas Cage drama about
U.S. Marines assigned to protect Navajo encryption experts in the Pacific
during World War II. The items are being stored in a lot outside the
county's Veterans Service Office in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the museum's displays would be centered around World War II.</TE>
<TE>   "We're focusing on World War II because it's a part of history we can
still capture," said Ron Melendez, a Vietnam veteran who is the museum's
lead organizer. "A lot of these guys are still alive, and we can get a
real sense of what it was like to be there."</TE>
<TE>   Melendez said he hopes to make the displays realistic and interactive.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want rooms with glass cases and uniforms," he said. "We're
planning on a room that will be like a World War I trench, where you'll
have to look over edges of the trench to see the display. Our intent is
to have a mock destroyer docked at Pearl Harbor and then show a troop
transport."</TE>
<TE>   Visitors would also have an opportunity to see what life was like for
prisoners of war.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll be able to get in the cage where a POW [might have] stayed
and see the amount of food they are given," said Carol Hatch, a special
project manager for the county. "It will look like you'll be in a camp."</TE>
<TE>   The first two planned phases of the project will cover World War II,
with subsequent additions centering on earlier conflicts--possibly as far
back as the Revolutionary War--and more on the wars in Vietnam and Korea.
While the county studies the cost and practicality of converting a
291,000-square-foot blimp hangar into a museum, Melendez is hoping his
group can use an adjacent building on the old base as an interim site.</TE>
<TE>   Melendez hopes a makeshift museum can be opened at the interim site by
late spring with the hangar conversion completed by early 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, nothing moves very fast on the mothballed air station,
which has been closed for three years. The northern hangar anchors the
southeast corner of the county's 84.5-acre parcel, which has been
designated for public parks, a homeless shelter, an animal shelter and a
Sheriff's Department training facility.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the land, which will eventually be turned over to the city
of Tustin, is intended for homes, a golf course, several schools and a
commercial business park. The Santa Ana Unified School District also
wants some of the land for schools.</TE>
<TE>   Both hangars are on the National Register of Historic Places. The
structures were completed in October 1943 and are so large they have been
known to support their own weather patterns, including miniature fog
banks. Although the hangar being eyed for a museum is in relatively good
shape, the southern hangar is more susceptible to northwest winds and has
been battered by the weather over the decades. It might have to be
demolished if the county can't find someone to restore it.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer said he has always supported the concept of a
military museum on the former Tustin Marine Corps Air Station.</TE>
<TE>   "Orange County has a rich military history," he said. "We need to
preserve and honor those who have served here."</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said the county could help pay for redesign and maintenance
costs of the northern hangar by renting it for dinners, banquets and even
weddings.</TE>
<TE>   "The blimp hangar is a phenomenal structure," he said. "I couldn't
think of any better place for this museum."</TE>
<TE>   Organizers hope the museum will eventually become a destination for
school field trips and Veterans Day ceremonies.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get this built," Mannes said, "it would be unrivaled in the
Western part of the country for military museums."</TE>

<HD>Neighbors Challenge School Expansion Plan</HD>
<DH>Education: Private institution in Granada Hills seeks to move
across the street to accommodate 400 more students. Residents object to
added traffic.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A private school's expansion plan gets a failing grade from the
campus' Granada Hills neighbors, who say they will oppose it at a public
hearing next week.</LD>
<LD>   Hillcrest Christian School has tried for three years to move its high
school to a five-acre lot across the street from its campus, which houses
800 students in kindergarten through 12th grade.</LD>
<LD>   Hillcrest wants to add 400 students, but, with three other schools in
the neighborhood, residents say their streets cannot take more traffic.</LD>
<TE>   "This is not some little bit of construction. This is an entire
campus," said Joy Ming, co-president of a neighborhood association that
is holding a meeting tonight to discuss Hillcrest's proposal. The meeting
will begin at 7 at St. Euphrasia Elementary School on Mayerling Street.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 11, some of the 300 residents who have signed a petition
opposing Hillcrest's project will attend a zoning hearing at Airtel Plaza
Hotel in Van Nuys to try to block the plan. To rally its own supporters
to attend, the school has given students and teachers that day off.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important that the school be put here [northwest corner of
Rinaldi Street and Shoshone Avenue]," said Rick Donnelly, Hillcrest's
development director.</TE>
<TE>   Hillcrest's battle is one that private institutions often encounter.
Whether the schools want to expand or renovate, neighbors object over
traffic, noise and other concerns. Public schools usually avoid such
obstacles, but private schools operate under zoning laws that apply to
businesses and can be tied up in the permit process for years.</TE>
<TE>   If Hillcrest were not a $4,000-a-year private school, residents might
not be so concerned, said the neighborhood association's other president,
Susan Tipton.</TE>
<TE>   "If it were a public school, all my neighborhood kids would have the
option of going. It would benefit everyone," she said. Hillcrest, she
added, "is something that is a private venture for people who have a
specific interest, want a specific type of education and have the money
to pay for it. It is not a public service."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Hillcrest sees itself differently. The nonprofit
Christian school does serve families who live nearby, Donnelly said.</TE>
<TE>   "The local community does want a choice in education, and it's obvious
by the enrollment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hillcrest's student body has grown sharply in the most recent of its
25 years and last year hit 800, the ceiling set by the school's zoning
permit.</TE>
<TE>   "We have waiting lists," Donnelly said.</TE>
<TE>   The school has revised its plans several times.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that there's anything outrageous about the points they
are making," he said. "On the other hand, we feel we have mitigated every
one of those in accordance with what's required."</TE>
<TE>   The neighbors say the school can do more by shrinking the 75,000
square feet of buildings it wants to construct and adding parking spaces
in its lots, or abandon its plan for a second campus.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too much school for the site," Tipton said. "They're cramming it
in and cramming it down our throats."</TE>
<TE>   Her group of neighbors would like Los Angeles City Councilman Hal
Bernson, who represents the area, to join them in opposing the expansion.
Bernson, who was out of town Wednesday, has not taken a position but has
followed the proposal through the permit process, his spokesman said.</TE>

<HD>Group Disputes Estimated Cost of a Valley City</HD>
<DH>Secession: Breakup proponents' analysis trims millions off LAFCO's
$1-billion-a-year projection.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Fernando Valley secessionists asserted Wednesday that they can
set up a city for hundreds of millions of dollars less than previously
estimated.</LD>
<LD>   The Local Agency Formation Commission, the agency studying secession,
has estimated that services for a Valley city would cost $1 billion per
year.</LD>
<LD>   The secession group Valley VOTE, however, estimates the annual cost at
$626 million.</LD>
<TE>   "We think the same level of service can be provided at costs
substantially below $1 billion," said Walter Kieser, a managing principal
of the consulting firm Economic and Planning Systems Inc., which provided
the new estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Kieser said the analysis is an evaluation of calculations made by a
LAFCO consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Some LAFCO assumptions, such as the cost of police services, were
challenged.</TE>
<TE>   "It's based on another way of doing things," he said.</TE>
<TE>   While LAFCO based its estimate on what currently is budgeted by Los
Angeles to serve the Valley, Kieser said that included hundreds of
positions, including police officers, not filled in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The new analysis reduces the costs to account for those unfilled
positions, Kieser said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the estimate has been submitted to LAFCO, Valley VOTE and
Kieser are putting the finishing touches on a proposed annual budget for
the first three years, which VOTE President Jeff Brain estimates will be
in the $800-million range.</TE>
<TE>   The Kieser report, which will be a basis for drafting a more formal
budget, was met with skepticism at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn believes LAFCO should rely on estimates by its own
consultants, which came up with the $1-billion figure based on data
provided by the city, Hahn spokeswoman Julie Wong said.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to be careful about underestimating the cost of providing
services to city neighborhoods," Wong said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski also will scrutinize any estimates that
services can be provided for much less, said Lisa Gritzner, an aide to
the councilwoman.</TE>
<TE>   "Historically, what we have seen is it always costs more than we think
it will," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Valley VOTE Chairman Richard Close said the group's consultant found
what he had suspected.</TE>
<TE>   "The preliminary conclusion is that the Valley city can be operated
with a large surplus, which can be used for more police and other
services," Close said.</TE>
<TE>   Valley VOTE declined to say how much the consultant was paid, or who
paid it.</TE>
<TE>   The group also released a list of buildings that it wants transferred
from ownership by Los Angeles to a new Valley city, including six police
stations, 34 fire stations, 19 libraries and 131 parks.</TE>

<HD>Christmas Tree Recycling Offered</HD>
<DH>Safety: Five O.C. cities are supplementing curbside pickups with
drop-off sites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least five Orange County cities will have Christmas tree
recycling centers open all or part of next week, officials said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   For everybody else--and most residents of the five cities as
well--curbside pickup is being offered on regular trash days or a day
later.</LD>
<LD>   "Just put them out and they'll be picked up," said Ron Shenkman,
senior vice president of Rainbow Disposal, which handles trash pickups
for Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley and Sunset Beach. "We've been
recycling trees like this for years."</LD>
<TE>   To qualify for pickup, most trash officials say, the trees must be
stripped of metal stands, decoration and tinsel. If they are large
trees--6 feet or taller--they must be cut in half.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole idea is to get them out of the house and away from the
house as soon as possible," said Steve Miller, a spokesman for the Orange
County Fire Authority. "These trees are extremely combustible. Any tree
that is two weeks or older has probably reached the critical stage."</TE>
<TE>   To avoid fires, Miller said, trees should not be stored next to the
house. "We've had people who left them leaning against the house and
their houses caught fire," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Under no circumstances should Christmas trees be burned in the
fireplace or anywhere else, Miller said. "We've had a lot of fires
started that way. People don't realize how fast a fire will spread."</TE>
<TE>   Drop-off recycling centers will be operating at these locations:</TE>
<TE>   * In Irvine, Sunset Environmental Industries, 16122 Construction
Circle West. Trees will be accepted through Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 2
p.m. weekdays, and 1 to 5 p.m. Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   * In Laguna Beach, the city employee parking lot, 505 Forest Ave.,
through Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   * In Mission Viejo at three locations--Youth Athletic Park on Olympiad
between Marguerite Parkway and Melinda Avenue; the Norman P. Murray
Community and Senior Center, 24932 Veterans Way at the east end of the
parking lot; Home Depot, 27052 Hillcrest Ave. Trees will be accepted
during regular business hours through Jan. 11.</TE>
<TE>   * In Santa Ana, Home Depot stores at 3500 MacArthur Blvd. and 1750 E.
Edinger Ave. through Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   * In Tustin, the parking lot of the Columbus Tustin Gym at Prospect
Avenue and Irvine Boulevard, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of Laguna Woods may call (949) 597-4600 to schedule a
pickup. Residents of Orange needing pickup after Wednesday may schedule
one by calling Waste Management of Orange, (714) 637-3010.</TE>
<TE>   All others may leave trees at curbside--or wherever they usually leave
trash--on regular pickup days. Pickups in several cities will be a day
late through this week due to the holiday.</TE>

<HD>Postal Service Delivers Stern Warning on Mailbox Misuse</HD>
<DH>Enforcement: Agency tells Orange mobile home park residents to stop
using receptacles to send notices, rent bills, newsletters sans postage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HICKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For more than 25 years, the residents of the Orange Crest Mobile
Home Park in Orange had a handy way of communicating with each other:
their mailboxes. Things such as personal notes, monthly newsletters,
bridge notices, greeting cards, clubroom party announcements, sympathy
cards. Management even used the mailbox for monthly rent statements.</LD>
<LD>   No more. The U.S. Postal Service is on to them and has put a stop to
the practice.</LD>
<LD>   Since the edict came down six weeks ago, the tightknit community has
been a bit riled. A resident apparently had complained to the local post
office about all the mailbox items without stamps. Postal authorities
immediately called park management.</LD>
<TE>   "It's ridiculous," said Thelma Rinker, who has lived in the neatly
kept, walled community of 89 units almost from the time it opened in
1975. "But if the government says 'Jump,' I guess you jump."</TE>
<TE>   But instead of jumping, Rinker spent $30 on a second mailbox for
neighborhood correspondence and placed it below her regular one. Nearly
half the residents did likewise.</TE>
<TE>   But not Robert E. Davis, who has lived there 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just too stubborn," said Davis, 77, a retired newspaperman. He's
the unofficial ombudsman for the park, made up mostly of senior citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Davis has gone on a letter-writing campaign. To his dismay,
he's learning that he probably won't win.</TE>
<TE>   It happens to be an issue the U.S. Postal Service has strong feelings
about. It falls under U.S. Code, Section 1725. And in more specific
language, Domestic Mail Manual D041-1.3, says, "No part of a mail
receptacle may be used to deliver any matter not bearing postage."</TE>
<TE>   Linda Dalton, consumer affairs manager for the Postal Service, wrote
to Davis that she hoped the majority would agree that the statute and the
postal regulations "further the public interest."</TE>
<TE>   The problem dates from the early 1930s, when utility companies
delivered their bills by mailbox through their own employees out reading
meters. The Postal Service saw a huge drop in revenue and decided to act.
Enforcement became even more important in 1970, Dalton wrote, when
Congress mandated that the Postal Service be self-sustaining.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognize that, from time to time, the regulations may cause
owners of mailboxes to become irritated," Dalton said. "I apologize that
this is inconvenient, but it must be uniformly enforced."</TE>
<TE>   To which Davis replied by mail: "Phooey."</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't our job to produce revenue for the Postal Service," Davis
said. He has since written to several members of Congress, but none have
yet responded.</TE>
<TE>   The issue has come up many times before, said Terri Bouffiou, the
Postal Service's Southern California spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   "We have Realtors who like to flood local mailboxes with the news that
they've sold a home in the neighborhood, a little free advertising
without paying postage," she said. "Or the Avon lady dropping off mailbox
notices that she'll soon be in the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "We just can't have people putting their hands in other people's
mailboxes, because there's a flip side to that. They could be taking
something out."</TE>
<TE>   Postal inspectors are kept busy investigating cases in which scam
artists have gleaned personal information about residents by stealing
from their mailboxes, Bouffiou said. Thefts of Social Security checks
from mailboxes are common too.</TE>
<TE>   The Postal Service doesn't plan to sue anyone unless it gets word of
repeat offenders. Bouffiou said she expects the park residents to abide
by its new notice on the honor system. Even though they're unhappy,
they're dutifully doing that.</TE>

<HD>Parading a $120,000 Thank-You Bouquet</HD>
<DH>Immigrants: Rose float is Vietnamese Americans' way of showing
their gratitude to the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite aching feet, sleepless nights and spending $50,000,
Madalenna Lai could smile proudly Wednesday knowing that she and others
in Southern California's Vietnamese community had made a dream come true.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm really happy that I have accomplished my gratitude to America,"
said Lai, a 60-year-old Pomona resident. "I am very thankful for the
people who allowed me to thank America."</LD>
<LD>   Lai and thousands of other Vietnamese Americans, in Little Saigon and
elsewhere, donated money for a float in the 113th annual Tournament of
Roses Parade. Each drop of sweat was worth the effort to send a message
of thanks to the United States for the kindness, generosity and
acceptance refugees found here, participants said.</LD>
<TE>   "It's something we can be proud of," said Van Thai Tran, a Garden
Grove councilman and one of seven Vietnamese Americans who rode on the
$120,000 float representing the largest Vietnamese community outside
Vietnam. "It symbolizes another step toward full assimilation and
contribution to the American society."</TE>
<TE>   Titled "Thank You America and the World," the float featured 6,000
roses depicting a mythical bird rising from the bow of a boat. The vessel
represented the fishing launches that carried many Vietnamese from their
war-torn homeland to freedom abroad.</TE>
<TE>   For Lai, the float symbolized her personal struggles and triumphs.</TE>
<TE>   "If there were no United States, our Vietnamese community wouldn't
have opportunities and success stories, so we are very grateful," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   She was 34, penniless and had four young children when she came to the
United States in 1975. Her husband stayed behind and was detained in a
communist re-education camp. Lai and her children lived in Pennsylvania
with a sponsor family before moving to Pasadena and El Monte. Her husband
finally joined them in California nearly 20 years later.</TE>
<TE>   Through various programs, Lai found money for eye surgery and
treatment for a lung infection. Over the years, her children won grants
and scholarships for their education: Two became dental hygienists, one
became a chiropractor, one joined the U.S. Navy.</TE>
<TE>   Since she first saw the Tournament of Roses Parade on television in
1977, Lai dreamed of entering a float. She and her associates applied to
the float committee for eight years and were rejected each time, but they
didn't give up. This year, they were accepted.</TE>
<TE>   The group--Vietnamese Cultural House, which has 12 members, all from
Southern California--spent eight months writing letters seeking donations
and collecting money in front of Little Saigon supermarkets. Lai sold her
two-story, four-bedroom Pomona home in April and donated $40,000 of the
proceeds to the float fund. Her daughter bought her another home in
Pomona.</TE>
<TE>   Lai said she still owes $10,000 of the float construction costs, a
bill she said she would pay by credit card.</TE>
<TE>   Lai said Wednesday that she has no regrets--just the need for a foot
massage and a nap after the countless hours she spent gluing roses to the
float, including a late night before the big day.</TE>
<TE>   "I have done what I was set out to do, and it was beautiful," Lai
said. "I am so thankful from the bottom of my heart."</TE>

<HD>Victim of Stabbing Is Called a 'Good Kid'</HD>
<DH>Crime: Cousin of man killed at cyber cafe denies he was a gang
associate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A cousin of a man stabbed to death outside a Garden Grove cyber
cafe over the weekend on Wednesday disputed police contentions that the
dead man was a gang associate, describing Phuong Huu Ly, 20, as "a very
good kid."</LD>
<LD>   Ly died early Monday, less than eight hours after a teenage assailant
stabbed him in the head with a screwdriver while Ly and a friend waited
to play video games at PC Cafe.</LD>
<LD>   Police said there has been an escalating pattern of problems at cyber
cafes, late-night businesses that charge hourly rates to play Internet
video games.</LD>
<TE>   Police said the cafes have been particularly attractive to gang
members, and more than a dozen prior incidents in Garden Grove and Santa
Ana have ranged from fights to attempted murder.</TE>
<TE>   Vanessa Huynh, 31, of Midway City said Wednesday that her cousin Ly
held a part-time job while attending college full time and had little
room in his life for gangs or regular visits to cyber cafes.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, she acknowledged, his family often didn't know where Ly would go
when he went out with friends. Huynh also said that while Ly "loved"
computer games, his family was unfamiliar with cyber cafes, which cater
to a predominantly Asian male clientele.</TE>
<TE>   She said Ly never mentioned gangs to his family, who she said remained
too distraught to talk to reporters. "He's a good kid, a very good kid,"
Huynh said at a news conference outside the Garden Grove Police
Department. "He wished to be a doctor someday."</TE>
<TE>   Police Sgt. Mike Handfield said investigators believe Ly was a gang
associate, despite the family's denials. "He's a gang associate; he hangs
with known gang members," Handfield said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Ly was killed by one of two young men, both estimated to
be 16 years old and 5 feet, 4 inches tall, weighing about 115 pounds and
with black hair shaved on the sides and spiked on top.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects were in the cafe when Ly and his friend arrived, police
said, and approached Ly as the two friends smoked cigarettes while
waiting for one of the cafe's 62 computers to become available.</TE>
<TE>   The assailant was silent as he pulled a large screwdriver from his
waistband and stabbed Ly in the head, then fled "after yelling some gang
names," police said. The assailant and his companion jumped into a
light-green four-door Honda Accord in which two other young men were
waiting, and the car sped off.</TE>

<HD>Teen Charged in Firecracker Attack on Dog</HD>
<DH>Crime: Suspect, 19, pleads not guilty to felony explosives and
animal cruelty counts. Canine was found tied to a stake, with half its
jaw blown off.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles teenager has been charged with illegally possessing
explosive devices and igniting a powerful firecracker that blew off part
of a dog's jaw.</LD>
<LD>   Gil Raul Delara, 19, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to 12 felony counts,
according to Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Delara is accused of 11 counts of recklessly possessing a destructive
device and explosive in public and one count of animal cruelty.</LD>
<TE>   He was in County Jail in lieu of a $500,000 bail. He is scheduled to
appear in Compton Superior Court on Jan. 9.</TE>
<TE>   The dog was taken to a veterinary hospital where he was euthanized,
according to Officer Jack Richter, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Richter said the dog, which appeared to be a German shepherd, lost its
lower jaw in the explosion. He said bomb squad officers responding to a
call from a citizen found the animal tied to a stake in an alley in the
10400 block of Hickory Street on Dec. 30.</TE>
<TE>   "How can anybody be so cruel?" Richter said.</TE>

<LD>A parolee driving while allegedly under the influence of drugs ran
a red light and slammed into another car late New Year's Day, killing a
21-year-old woman and critically injuring her baby son, authorities said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Troy Shaw, 33, of Van Nuys was being held at Van Nuys jail on
suspicion of gross vehicular manslaughter in the 11:20 p.m. accident at
Sunland and Glenoaks boulevards, said Officer Jack Richter of the Los
Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   Shaw is charged in the death of Melissa Perez of Burbank, who was in
the front passenger seat of the car that was broadsided. Perez died at
the scene from severe head injuries. Her 22-month-old son, strapped into
a rear car seat, was in critical condition Wednesday at Childrens
Hospital Los Angeles with head and chest injuries. He was breathing with
the help of a ventilator, hospital spokesman Steve Rutledge said.</LD>
<TE>   Perez's mother, Martha Cohen, 44, who was driving, was treated and
released from Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills with
injuries to her stomach and chest, hospital spokeswoman Tiffany Devall
said.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw was treated at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Panorama City
for minor injuries. Police said he was on parole, but did not say of what
he was convicted.</TE>
<TE>   They said he appeared to be under the influence of drugs at the time
of the accident and that he did not have a valid driver's license.</TE>

<HD>1,000 Mourn 2 Teens Killed in Crash</HD>
<DH>Funeral: Westlake High boys are remembered as more than good
students who spent spare time as an athlete and guitarist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly 1,000 friends and family members attended a joint funeral
Wednesday for two popular Westlake High School students killed in a car
crash three days after Christmas.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan Alexander Bass and Kenneth Marshall Glass, both 16, were
remembered as good students and good friends, with Bass an aspiring
musician and Glass an athlete who dreamed of studying business or
engineering.</LD>
<LD>   The close friendships the two youths and their families enjoyed with
many of those gathered for the service at Calvary Community Church in
Westlake Village was much in evidence.</LD>
<TE>   With the youths' caskets behind him, Rev. Craig Beeker said the teens'
families hoped "that after this is over today, you will still drop by
their houses and eat out of their refrigerators."</TE>
<TE>   Beeker then left the altar and walked among a large contingent of
Westlake High students, teachers and coaches as John Lennon's "Beautiful
Boy" began to play from speakers overhead.</TE>
<TE>   The two students were killed Friday when a car driven by Glass
careened out of control and hit a brick wall on Westlake Boulevard near
Hillcrest Drive.</TE>
<TE>   Two others in the car, Westlake High students Joshua Kuai and Jenae
Chu, both 16, survived the crash. Kuai attended Wednesday's service.</TE>
<TE>   "They were my best friends and I feel really bad about what happened,"
said Kuai, who was wearing a thickly padded neck brace. "I feel like I
got off easy."</TE>
<TE>   Glass was a member of the basketball and volleyball teams at the
school and had hopes of studying engineering or business at Columbia
University after graduation in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Bass was a rock guitarist who performed in a garage band called Trase.
He was also a golfer with plans to play on the UCLA team.</TE>
<TE>   But the two were much more than good students who passed their spare
time as a jock and a guitar player, according to those who knew them
best.</TE>
<TE>   During a eulogy that lasted nearly 3 1/2 hours, friends and relatives
of the two teens described the little things that were shaping the two
boys into young men.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Bass, an uncle of Jordan, said among the many things the
good-natured prankster added to the family was a taste for edgy music and
practical jokes.</TE>
<TE>   "I can thank him for bringing the sounds of Limp Bizkit and Korn into
my house," Bass told the audience with a laugh. "He was a compassionate
young man and an amazing golfer."</TE>
<TE>   Another uncle, David Cherin, remembered a 6-year-old Jordan
mercilessly beating him at a Nintendo boxing video game and then
earnestly telling him, "I will help you get better."</TE>
<TE>   Bass' mother, Cheryl, spoke directly to Kuai, seated in the front row.</TE>
<TE>   "Jenae and Joshua, we know God has a plan for you because you survived
this," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Glass was also remembered fondly with touching and humorous stories.</TE>
<TE>   Volleyball coach Greg Gibbons said Glass "was a dream as an athlete.
He never talked."</TE>
<TE>   "But he gave 100% of himself and he respected everyone so he got
respect."</TE>
<TE>   Known as a shy student with a dry sense of humor, Glass would
sometimes fake a sore throat so he would not have to talk when called
upon, Gibbons said.</TE>
<TE>   As each person came up to tell a story or lead a prayer, they passed
the teens' caskets. Large bunches of flowers, including red roses, were
stacked on each.</TE>
<TE>   Next to Glass' casket were two white pillars. On one was placed a
basketball and a teddy bear. On the other was a volleyball.</TE>
<TE>   A few feet away, one of Jordan's cherished electric guitars rested on
a stand next to a large bouquet of roses shaped like a guitar.</TE>
<TE>   Hung high above the altar were pictures of the two friends.</TE>
<TE>   Several classmates read poems seeking reasons for the two deaths.
Beeker, the pastor at Westlake Lutheran Church, cautioned against asking
questions "that have no answers."</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Westlake High basketball team, who had voted to
postpone a tournament game within hours of their teammate's death,
promised to dedicate the rest of the season in the memory of Glass.</TE>
<TE>   His mother Julia remembered a time at the market when she nearly had a
"mommy moment" as she dealt with groceries, Kenny and his younger
sisters.</TE>
<TE>   "But I had an epiphany," she told the audience. "I started enjoying
the moments before I cleaned up the mess."</TE>
<TE>   Craig Glass said his son had the temperament of someone who would
never give up. He was gangly and out of sorts on the basketball court at
first.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually he found his way, the elder Glass said.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny told his dad he wanted to join Jordy's band, Trase, as the lead
singer.</TE>
<TE>   But after he found his voice wasn't up to it, he became the band
manager, his dad said.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to be the leader, to control a company one day," Craig
Glass said.</TE>
<TE>   "But bad luck and bad judgment got in the way."</TE>

<HD>Plan Charts Santa Clara River Recovery</HD>
<DH>Environment: Proposal targets a stretch of the waterway east of
Piru, polluted by oil spilled in the '94 Northridge quake.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Environmental officials on Wednesday released a draft plan to
restore a 16-mile stretch of the Santa Clara River that was damaged when
an oil pipeline ruptured during the 1994 Northridge earthquake, sending
tens of thousands of gallons of oil into the watershed.</LD>
<LD>   "This work can bring damaged ecosystems back to their pre-spill
condition, so wildlife can flourish there," said Harlan Henderson, an
administrator with the state Fish and Game Department's Office of Spill
Prevention and Response.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal was developed by Fish and Game and the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service.</LD>
<TE>   Several restoration projects are listed in the draft plan, including
the purchase of land along the river and establishment of permanent
conservation easements; the control of invasive nonnative plant species
and continuous monitoring.</TE>
<TE>   A $7.1-million settlement paid by Arco after the earthquake will fund
the restoration projects.</TE>
<TE>   About 190,000 gallons of oil damaged or destroyed about 100 acres of
plants and 150 acres of river sediment and killed an undetermined number
of fish, bird and wildlife species along a stretch of the river between
Santa Clarita to just east of Piru in Ventura County, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The 130-mile Four Corners Pipe Line runs from Kern County oil fields
to South Bay refineries.</TE>
<TE>   During the magnitude 6.8 temblor, the 10-inch diameter pipe ruptured
in several places, causing spills into the Santa Clara River near
Valencia and a leak near O'Melveny Elementary School in San Fernando,
which fueled fires that destroyed cars and homes.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement under the federal Oil Pollution Act stipulates that
funds must be used for habitat rehabilitation, vegetation replacement and
protection of Santa Clara River watershed and wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   The 100-mile river, which flows from the San Gabriel Mountains to the
ocean, is one of the last natural river systems in Southern California,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The river's watershed covers about 1,600 square miles and supports
endangered and threatened species such as the western snowy plover, least
Bell's vireo and arroyo toad.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is wonderful that finally a plan is coming out because
people were concerned about where the money went from the settlement,"
said Lynne Plambeck, president of the citizens group Santa Clarita
Organization for Planning and the Environment.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone will be ecstatic that the agencies will acquire land and
conservation easements, because that is the only way to protect the
river," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A public meeting on the plan is scheduled for 4 p.m. Jan. 15 at Robert
J. Lagomarsino Visitor Center, Channel Islands National Park, 1901
Spinnaker Drive, Ventura.</TE>

<HD>Officer in Fatality Is Placed on Leave</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Probe involving Oxnard policeman, whose car hit a
Seabee while on a 911 call, continues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Oxnard police officer who struck and killed a 20-year-old Seabee
with his patrol car New Year's Day while responding to a 911 call has
been placed on administrative leave.</LD>
<LD>   Humberto Jimenez, a 16-year veteran of the department, is expected to
remain on paid leave for several days while the California Highway Patrol
conducts an investigation.</LD>
<LD>   "He is very shaken," Oxnard Police Department spokesman David Keith
said.</LD>
<TE>   Jimenez was headed to south Oxnard about 4:20 a.m. Tuesday to provide
backup to officers handling a domestic disturbance call when his cruiser
struck Christopher Shubert as the sailor crossed Ventura Road just north
of Channel Islands Boulevard, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Shubert had been eating with members of his battalion at a nearby
restaurant and left to buy cigarettes at a store across the four-lane
road, officials said. As he returned, he was hit by the southbound
cruiser, which did not have its flashing lights or siren on, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Shubert died at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard police did not say how fast Jimenez was traveling, but said the
impact knocked Shubert out of his shoes and carried him about 100 feet
into a crosswalk at Ventura Road and Channel Islands Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   The intersection is next to Naval Base Ventura County in Port Hueneme,
where Shubert was stationed.</TE>
<TE>   Keith said department policy indicates it is not necessary for an
officer providing backup to use lights and sirens.</TE>
<TE>   CHP officials said it will take at least a week to complete the

<HD>New Study Looks for Ways to Cut Gridlock on 101</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Numerous agencies are backing the $4.5-million
analysis, but longtime commuters doubt it will help reduce traffic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new study of the 101 Freeway, hailed as the most comprehensive
analysis ever of the nightmarish highway, is underway, a consortium of
government agencies announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The $4.5-million, three-year effort seeks to reduce congestion and
improve safety along the 40-mile stretch from Thousand Oaks to downtown
Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers will seek public input during three community meetings this
month, but the study is already being greeted with skepticism by longtime
commuters who have grown weary of studies done on everything from
interchange improvements to double-decking the freeway to building a
trolley line along the median.</LD>
<TE>   "Not only do studies come and go, not only has there been no action,
the problems [on the 101] are getting worse and worse," said Richard
Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. "When will the
studies end and the constructions begin?"</TE>
<TE>   "The 101 has been studied to death," said Richard Katz, co-chairman of
the San Fernando Valley Transportation Strike Force.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, the heaviest 101 traffic can be found in Thousand
Oaks between California 23 and Hampshire Road. Commuters from the growing
cities of Moorpark and Simi Valley clog the corridor as they merge from
California 23.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the California Department of Transportation counted 189,000
cars traveling past the interchange daily in both directions--up 23% from
a decade earlier. During the 7:30 to 8:30 morning crunch, 15,800 cars
surged past, an increase of 15% from 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters said the new study will be different and may lead to
change.</TE>
<TE>   One of the busiest corridors in California, the 101--also known as the
Ventura Freeway along its western part and the Hollywood Freeway along
its southeastern segment--can resemble a massive parking lot during peak
commuting hours. Usually gridlocked in both directions, the freeway
channels traffic to and from downtown, Burbank movie studios, the Van
Nuys government complex and Warner Center in Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The 101 is home to two of California's busiest interchanges, where it
grinds across the Pasadena Freeway downtown and the San Diego Freeway in
Sherman Oaks, said Tom Choe, chief of freeway operations for Caltrans.
Only the interchange between the Pasadena and Santa Monica freeways near
downtown has more traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The study "is not going to be just another study," said state Sen.
Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica), who helped secure much of its funding when
she was in the Assembly. Unlike previous analyses, this one will seek
public input, examine the entire corridor rather than pieces of it and
identify short-term as well as long-term solutions, Kuehl said. Another
goal is to identify funding sources for implementing its recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   The study is being conducted by Parsons Brinckerhoff Inc., an
engineering consulting firm headquartered in New York with offices
throughout California.</TE>
<TE>   It is being funded with $3 million from Gov. Gray Davis' Traffic
Congestion Relief Program and additional money from Caltrans, the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Las Virgenes-Malibu Council of
Governments and the Southern California Assn. of Governments.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with other studies, this one is "not amorphous" and has the
most comprehensive collaboration of local governments and agencies, which
will help ensure its success, said Los Angeles County Supervisor and MTA
board member Zev Yaroslavsky.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all looking to see what we can do in the short term and long
term to improve that corridor," Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Community meetings from 6 to 8 p.m. will be held on Jan. 22 at Encino
Tarzana Medical Center, first floor, 16237 Ventura Blvd.; on Jan. 23 at
Calabasas Community Center, Room A, 27040 Malibu Hills Road; and on Jan.
24 at Los Angeles City College, Faculty and Staff Center, 855 N. Vermont
Ave.</TE>

<HD>Prehistoric Indian Carving Imperiled by Housing Project</HD>
<DH>Development: Irvine Co. promises to preserve more significant
sites, but local tribal leaders say the cave with the tiny artifact is
sacred ground.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The historical and religious significance of a tiny, ancient wall
carving that might be bulldozed to make way for 2,500 homes has prompted
growing debate between local American Indian groups and Irvine Co.</LD>
<LD>   The carving looks like little more than a doodle, according to
archeologists who have seen it--a wavy line about 4 inches long with a
circle at one end. It was cut into the wall of a shallow cave by a Native
American almost 2,000 years ago on what is now Irvine Co. land near the
Turtle Rock community in Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   Company officials and archeologists have invited local tribal
representatives to view it and submit ideas for its fate. But they say
there are far larger, more significant finds that will be preserved in
the area.</LD>
<TE>   Local Native American groups, however, say the site and others like it
are sacred grounds that all should be left intact.</TE>
<TE>   "The Turtle Rock area is considered one of the more sacred areas, and
I would imagine these sites could be tied to some of our major villages,"
said Dameon Shilo, chairman of the Juaneno Band of Mission Indians.</TE>
<TE>   The hollow with the carving is one of nine containing Indian artifacts
that dot 1,600 rugged acres in Irvine at the foot of the San Joaquin
Hills. Seven will be preserved on about 1,000 open acres bordered roughly
by the San Joaquin Hills toll road, Shady Canyon Road and Bonita Canyon
Drive.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining two, which sit on opposite sides of an unnamed creek,
are in the middle of an area where Irvine Co. has approval to build the
homes.</TE>
<TE>   One of the sites is definitely destined for demolition. Numerous
archeologists agree that the crushed shells and chipped stone inside tell
little about the Native Americans who used it. The site has been
documented, as required by law, and archeologists will monitor demolition
in case other artifacts hidden deeper in the soil are turned up. If so,
any significant artifacts will be removed.</TE>
<TE>   The other cave contains the wall carving that some consider a valuable
archeological find.</TE>
<TE>   Although such cave drawings or carvings exist throughout Southern
California, the debate over this one centers on whether every fragment
can or should be preserved to maintain historic and cultural links.</TE>
<TE>   The floor of the cave containing the small etching is thick with
midden--a dark, greasy soil mixed with shells, plant material and chipped
stone. Archeologists say the midden shows that tribes probably ate meals
there, perhaps as long as 1,700 years ago. The chipped stone suggests
that tribal members also fashioned their arrowheads in the rock shelter.</TE>
<TE>   Like other etchings found in caves around the county, archeologists
say, it holds clues to ancient civilizations that roamed the area, some
dating back 3,000 years.</TE>
<TE>   The language of the walls--the carvings and drawings--is unknown, and
experts say they can only guess at the meaning. Some could have served as
navigational tools; some could have religious or ceremonial connotations.
But some experts say there is still information that can be gleaned from
them.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the site is important and still has a lot of information
in it," said Pamela Maxwell, an archeologist with the Army Corps of
Engineers who examined the cave. "It can tell us what was going on at
that time. But ultimately, it's the Irvine Co.'s property, and we cannot
legally demand that they save it."</TE>
<TE>Preserving Sites Isn't Mandatory</TE>
<TE>   Under the California Environmental Quality Act and the National
Historic Preservation Act, developers are required to study the
significance of archeological sites. While preservation is encouraged, it
isn't mandatory. The developer can build over the site, provided that the
artifacts and other important information are documented in some way.</TE>
<TE>   But to members of the Juaneno and Gabrielino/Tongva tribes, whose
ancestors inhabited the area, the value of the rock shelters goes beyond
their scientific worth. They are sacred ground and should be
preserved--no matter how insignificant the artifacts may appear to be,
the tribes say.</TE>
<TE>   "This is part of our history; it is tied to our culture," Shilo said.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Apodaca, a Chapman University professor and an authority on
Native American studies, cautions against tampering with historic sites
no matter how small they might be.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not acceptable to destroy the artifacts of history, even if they
are documented on paper," said Apodaca, a Native American. "Later
generations can always question whether that documentation is accurate or
even true."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Co. generally favors preservation but believes it can be taken
to an extreme, said Steve Letterly, vice president of environmental
permitting.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point, these groups will have to decide what's important to
preserve," said Steve Conkling, an archeologist hired by Irvine Co. to
study the cave.</TE>
<TE>   If the cave, known to bureaucrats as ORA-269, is destroyed, it
wouldn't be the first time Irvine Co. has bulldozed an ancient Native
American site. In 1995 and 1996, the company unearthed about 600 human
burials and thousands of artifacts estimated to be 4,000 to 9,500 years
old. The excavation was done to make way for 149 luxury homes in the
pricey Harbor Cove community above Newport Beach's Back Bay.</TE>
<TE>   The remains were later reburied by local tribes, and artifacts were
preserved off-site, as dictated by state and federal laws. But some
experts, including one from the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum
of Natural History in Washington, decried the destruction of the site.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, however, Irvine Co. officials argue that there are
carvings more intriguing than this that will be preserved. One, believed
to be about 3,000 years old, is in a cave atop a hill with a sweeping
view of the Upper Newport Beach Bay, the Long Beach skyline and Catalina
Island on a clear day. Inside the cavern is a carving of a rattlesnake
that spans the whole interior.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the most important sites in the San Joaquin Hills, if
not the whole county," Conkling said. "It can tell us how the culture
changed over time."</TE>
<TE>   Archeologists believe that site was used by tribes for thousands of
years. Because of its location, Conkling said, it is thought that it may
have been a tribal meeting place.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Co. officials say they've gone to great lengths to preserve
that and the other most significant sites.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why you have a 1,600-acre project area with 1,009 acres
preserved in open space," Letterly said. "That's where seven of these
sites are."</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, shelters and caves like these are not uncommon. There
are 1,500 of them in Orange County, according to state records.</TE>
<TE>   "If you took any 1,600 acres along the San Joaquin Hills, there's a
good chance you would find more [Indian artifacts]," Letterly said.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Co. officials have invited several local tribes to tour the
dens and offer possible suggestions for preservation, or alternatives if
the company decides to proceed with leveling the cave.</TE>
<TE>   Alternatives could include taking archival photos, making a relief of
the etching or removing the portion of the rock on which it appears,
Conkling said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anything is off the table at this point," he said. "But
there's a variety of things you can do. . . . What's important is getting
together with these groups and figuring out how we can capture the value
of what's being affected."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the company has heard from three groups, including Anthony
Morales, who chairs the Gabrielino/Tongva Tribal Council in San Gabriel.</TE>
<TE>Tribes Consider All the Caves Significant</TE>
<TE>   Morales would like to see all nine caves, including the tiny one near
Turtle Rock, remain intact. He said Irvine Co. may be overlooking the
cultural significance of the entire project area.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me with that many sites, it could have been a gathering
place or even a village," Morales said. "You have nine recorded sites,
and that to me is indicative that there was a living habitat there."</TE>
<TE>   Getting everyone to agree on a plan could be difficult, said Rob Wood,
an environmental specialist with the Native American Heritage Commission
in Sacramento. A small etching in a rock might not seem important to
some, but it could hold a lot of meaning to the ancestors of the tribe
that put it there.</TE>
<TE>   "These sites are extremely significant from a religious and cultural
standpoint," Wood said. "Because California is an area under constant
development, these sites disappear all the time. They're a finite
resource, and people will fight very hard to ensure these sites are
preserved."</TE>

<HD>L.A. to Fight 11th-Hour Billboard Installation</HD>
<DH>Signs: The city attorney says a firm started putting them up along
freeways just before new restrictions took effect. The company says its
contract is valid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angering Los Angeles city and county officials, a major billboard
company began putting up more than a dozen signs along Los Angeles area
freeways just hours before new restrictions took effect New Year's Day.</LD>
<LD>   Before 2002 rang in, STI/Outdoor LLC began constructing new billboards
along some of the county's most heavily traveled freeways, many of them
in the central Los Angeles area and the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo said he would go to court today to seek a
temporary restraining order to block the installation of up to 25
billboards on land owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. He
said he will argue that the billboards require city permits that have not
been issued and that they would violate an ordinance banning them along
freeways.</LD>
<TE>   The city also plans to file a civil complaint--which could result in
damages--alleging that the billboards are a nuisance and represent unfair
business practices.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an outrageous act on behalf of the billboard company," said
Delgadillo. "This company is trying to make an end run around city laws
and the will of the people, and I'm not going to tolerate it."</TE>
<TE>   A representative of the billboard partnership said it believes it had
a legal right to begin construction on the signs by Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Officials accused STI/Outdoor of violating a contract that gave the
partnership permission to put up 41 billboards and 10 kiosks on MTA
property in Southern California in exchange for the installation of
toilets in MTA facilities and a share of billboard profits of at least
$23 million.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, officials said, the billboard company was
required to receive city approval before installing the giant signs along
the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature also weighed in on the matter, passing legislation by
state Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) that required billboard
companies to obtain the necessary local permits before building on MTA
property. That law took effect Tuesday. But city officials said they
believe local permits were required even before the Polanco measure
applied.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the billboard company disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a binding contract which allows these billboards to be placed
in the ground on MTA right-of-way," said Howard Sunkin, a lobbyist for
the partnership.</TE>
<TE>   Sunkin said the requirement that local permits be obtained was not
part of the contract, but was adopted separately by the MTA board as a
resolution in August 2000. He said the MTA board did not have the right
to add that requirement.</TE>
<TE>   But county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who serves on the MTA board,
said he believes that the company has acted in bad faith.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they've made a big mistake," he said. "They've violated the
provisions of the contract, and they've tried to beat the clock on a new
state law. The MTA will argue that they are in breach of contract. I
don't think this will stand."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles city officials have struggled to control billboard blight,
adopting a variety of restrictions over the years. With well-sited
billboards each generating up to $1 million a year, according to one
industry official, the stakes are high.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council is about to take up a proposal that would allow as
many as 70 new billboards along freeways in exchange for about 2,000
other signs being removed from other parts of the city. Currently, there
is a moratorium on new billboards in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Competing billboard firms that had hoped to benefit from the proposed
plan were among those who raised a cry to city officials when STI/Outdoor
began putting up billboards.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the city fails in court, it may have other leverage against
the new billboards. Viacom, the parent company of Outdoor Systems Inc.,
is part of a separate partnership given a city contract last month that
could be worth $750 million over 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Under that deal, Viacom/Decaux LLC will install 150 pay toilets and
3,200 other pieces of street furniture in exchange for the right to put
3,200 ads on the furniture.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo, meanwhile, appeared to relish playing the role of enforcer
against the billboard industry. He came under criticism last year after
two billboard companies advertised his candidacy on their signs. Outdoor
Systems was not one of the firms making the independent expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a billboard moratorium, and I intend to uphold that,"
Delgadillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Greig Smith, an aide to Councilman Hal Bernson, spent part of New
Year's Day surveying the locations and photographing the construction
work as evidence. Proposed locations for the billboards in Bernson's
district include along San Fernando Road next to the Ronald Reagan
Freeway and a site near the intersection of the Golden State and Foothill
freeways.</TE>

<HD>Pasadena Workers Sue for Job Parity</HD>
<DH>Labor: The temporary employees claim they do the same work as
permanent colleagues, sometimes for years, but receive much lower pay and
no benefits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of women filed a lawsuit Wednesday that alleges they and
others work full-time for the city of Pasadena without the health
insurance, paid vacations and retirement benefits that state rules
require.</LD>
<LD>   The suit contends that the city, which otherwise is known for its
commitment to improving its workers' lot, uses the subterfuge of keeping
some employees temporary for as long as six years to avoid the costs of
permanent status.</LD>
<LD>   Their case illustrates the situation of many government workers in
California, and follows a recent state appeals court victory by temporary
workers at the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, their
attorneys said.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a dirty little secret hidden beneath Pasadena's
respectability veneer and progressive ideas," said Glenn Rothner, a labor
lawyer representing the women in the Pasadena case. He said Pasadena does
not provide benefits to hundreds of "permatemps," although they otherwise
are indistinguishable from permanent city employees "with whom they work
shoulder to shoulder."</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena City Atty. Michele Beal Bagneris said Wednesday that she
would reserve detailed comment until she reviews the case. Ann Erdman,
city spokeswoman, said there are about 100 employees of temporary
agencies working in city departments, among a total work force of about
2,000.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Hernandez, Angela Cormier, Vanessa Ramirez and others said they
were hired through employment agencies as temporary workers but do the
same customer service work in the city's utilities department as
co-workers with permanent status, and have the same supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Because Pasadena is part of the California Public Employees Retirement
System, or CalPERS, all its workers, including those women, are entitled
to benefits under state law, their lawsuit alleges.</TE>
<TE>   The suit follows the state Court of Appeal ruling in October involving
the MWD. That court ruled that anyone working as a "common law" employee
for a public agency that is part of the state retirement system is due
pension benefits. A common law employee, as opposed to an independent
contractor, is one whose work is controlled day by day by the government
agency, the court said.</TE>
<TE>   The MWD case could affect hundreds of workers there and is being
appealed to the state Supreme Court. But thousands more workers may be
affected statewide, according to court papers in that case.</TE>
<TE>   About 104 cities, counties and special districts filed legal papers
supporting the MWD and arguing that giving full benefits to all those
workers could make it difficult to hire any outside consultants and badly
hurt government finances.</TE>
<TE>   "The consequences of a determination that all common law employees
must be enrolled in PERS will be a devastating financial impact on public
agencies throughout the state," those cities and agencies said.</TE>
<TE>   The Superior Court has yet to decide whether other benefits such as
sick leave should be given to the MWD workers.</TE>
<TE>   The Pasadena suit alleges that the employment agencies are merely a
payroll service, not the real employers.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, 34, of Hacienda Heights said she went to Pasadena City Hall
seeking a job in 1995 and was directed to an employment agency, Act One.
Since then she has been shuffled among various employment agencies while
keeping her position at the city Water and Power Department.</TE>
<TE>   "Thankfully, my supervisor's been real good about allowing me vacation
time," she said. However, Hernandez, a mother of two, said she does not
get paid for that time off, and loses wages when her children get sick
and she has to stay home.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Cormier, 32, a single mother of three, has worked in the same
department for two years. She said she prays that no one in her family
gets sick. "If one of my kids gets sick, I have to take them to the
doctor and pay for the medical bills myself. Plus, I lose a day's pay for
being off work," she said. Though PERS offers good prices on premiums for
health coverage, Cormier said, she cannot afford the plans offered
through her employment agency.</TE>
<TE>   "We do exactly the same work as regular city employees, but they get
benefits and are paid a lot more," said Cormier, who earns $11.25 an hour
without benefits. Her attorney said permanent workers in the same jobs
earn at least $5 an hour more. City officials declined to discuss pay
scales, citing the litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena City Atty. Beal Bagneris said the outcome of the Pasadena
case will depend on how the state Supreme Court handles the MWD appeal.
"Other courts will be trying to wait and see what happens," she said.</TE>

<HD>Girls Convicted as Adults Serve Time in Solitary</HD>
<DH>Jail: Law says juveniles cannot mix with other inmates, but there
are too few girls to warrant a separate cellblock. One complains of
isolation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Noemi has been in the county jail's discipline unit for months. But
unlike the women around her, she was not sent to solitary confinement
because she was deemed out of control.</LD>
<LD>   In Noemi's case, her problem is not her behavior but her age: She is
17.</LD>
<LD>   Noemi is part of a wave of juveniles who are being sent to answer for
their crimes in adult court and sentenced to serve their time in adult
institutions. And Noemi, whose last name is being withheld because of her
age, presents a problem for sheriff's officials, who run the county
jails.</LD>
<TE>   The law requires underage offenders to be kept separate from adults.
Though judges remand enough boys to the county jail to warrant their own
cellblock, girls are few and far between.</TE>
<TE>   So jailers improvise. Whenever girls are sent to them for
incarceration--several times a year--officials put them in solitary
confinement, a move that satisfies the legal requirement to keep the
children separate but that imposes far more difficult conditions on the
young inmates than they would otherwise face.</TE>
<TE>   It is their only legal option, sheriff's officials said in interviews
last week.</TE>
<TE>   Children's rights advocates complain that the conditions are
inappropriate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a dungeon," Javier Stauring, director of the juvenile detention
ministry of the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, said of the
discipline ward. "It's a depressing, deplorable place."</TE>
<TE>   A children's advocate who has taken up Noemi's case says the
conditions are also illegal, charging that jailers are not meeting her
educational, recreational or hygienic requirements and have denied her
access to over-the-counter drugs, citing her age. She also says that
Noemi--who was convicted of robbing a woman on the street and who
accepted the jail time as part of a plea bargain--has verbal and
occasionally physical contact with adult inmates anyway, and that the
inmates she encounters in the area of the jail where she is held are
particularly dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   "Ironically, in attempting to segregate [her] from the adult
population, the jail administration has exposed her to the most dangerous
or disturbed inmates in the facility," Carole Shauffer, executive
director of the Youth Law Center, wrote Sheriff Lee Baca. "Contact with
these inmates is exactly the harm that juvenile/adult separation
requirements were designed to prevent."</TE>
<TE>   She said Noemi is alone in her cell about 23 hours a day.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials dispute that. They say Noemi is alone in her cell
no more than 21 hours a day and gets everything she's entitled to: three
hours of recreation a week, showers every other day, teacher visits and
access to a nurse. They deny that she communicates with the adult inmates
around her, but acknowledge that she can hear them when they scream.</TE>
<TE>   "She is the only juvenile we have in the facility. We have to make
sure she's safe. This is the safest place," said sheriff's Capt. John
Franklin, who oversees the Twin Towers Jail. "It puts us in a bind
because we have to give her constant security."</TE>
<TE>   That means calling deputies from other areas whenever she moves from
place to place, removing other inmates from hallways, showers, a
television room or the roof-top recreation area.</TE>
<TE>   Eastlake Juvenile Judge Rudy Diaz said he's not concerned about the
legality of her conditions, but he's worried about their psychological
effects.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is, essentially, that she's isolated. She's doing hard
time," said Diaz, who inspected the facility last month.</TE>
<TE>   Noemi said that after advocates took up her case, deputies began
giving her more time out of her cell, allowing her to watch an entire
movie, rather than just an hour alone in the television room, for
example.</TE>
<TE>   To pass the hours in her cell, she plays cards, draws, reads the
novels and the assignments dropped off by a visiting teacher each week,
and talks to the women around her.</TE>
<TE>   She said deputies at times threaten to write up the women who talk to
her, and they have posted a paper sign on her door: "No inmate contact."</TE>
<TE>   "That's like showing a mouse a piece of cheese and saying: You can't
get it," she complained. "How can they house me somewhere and expect them
not to talk to me?"</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Noemi's sister, who committed the same crime and received
the same sentence, is in regular housing, working in the kitchen and
living a more normal life--to the degree that incarceration is normal.</TE>
<TE>   "She's being punished for being under 18," Stauring, of the
archdiocese, said of Noemi. "I don't see why they can't just let girls do
their time here at juvenile hall."</TE>
<TE>   Franklin, of the Sheriff's Department, wonders the same thing. Because
the judge gave her a jail term, he said he doesn't have authority to
transfer her to juvenile hall.</TE>
<TE>   Noemi's arrest in July was her first, according to her lawyer and
court files, but her case was sent to adult court because of the
seriousness of the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with a screwdriver, Noemi, her sister and another girl robbed a
woman in Downey. When the victim wouldn't let go of her purse, they
assaulted her with a Mace-like spray.</TE>
<TE>   In a report to the court, a probation officer said that if she were
sentenced to prison, he thought she should be housed in the California
Youth Authority, the state's prison for minors, because of "her tender
years."</TE>
<TE>   Noemi instead made a deal with prosecutors for three years' probation
and a year in jail--the same deal taken by her sister and friend,
according to Noemi and her lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, nobody considered that Noemi's time would be served in
solitary confinement, said her defense lawyer, Andy Stein.</TE>
<TE>   "No judge would sentence her to that," Stein said. He said he intends
to file a motion asking the judge who sentenced Noemi to order her housed
in juvenile hall instead.</TE>

<KH>SURROUNDINGS / SCHMIDT'S TUNNEL</KH>
<HD>Digging His Tunnel Was a Life's Mission</HD>
<DH>* William Schmidt spent 32 years boring through a mountain. He was
obsessed, but the question is why.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like all ambitious men, William Henry Schmidt yearned to leave his
mark on the world.</LD>
<LD>   He did it by digging.</LD>
<LD>   In a grand metaphor for the futility of human endeavor, Schmidt spent
32 years hand-gouging a half-mile tunnel through a mountain peak near the
Mojave Desert, for no clear purpose except to finish the job. An outhouse
and a plaque now mark the spot, miles up a dirt road south of Ridgecrest.</LD>
<TE>   "A monument to determination and perseverance," the plaque declares.</TE>
<TE>   "Burro" Schmidt, as he came to be known, finished the tunnel in 1938
at age 67. He died 16 years later, leaving an obscure but enduring
legacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Why a man would spend half his life drilling a hole through a
mountain of solid rock is a question often contemplated," writer Slim
Randles reflected in a 1965 issue of Desert magazine. Though Randles
offered no conclusion, he likened the magnitude of Schmidt's work to the
construction of Egypt's great pyramid of Khufu.</TE>
<TE>   A single man had fashioned "a monument to himself that will outlast
the ancient tomb," Randles suggested.</TE>
<TE>   Ripley's "Believe It Or Not" took due note of the feat. A column in
the early 1940s described the 2,087-foot tunnel--through granitic rock
4,200 feet above sea level--as "the greatest one-man mining achievement
in history."</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt appears in old photographs as lean and square-faced; in later
years he has a beard and shock of white hair. A hard set to his mouth
conveys a life of toil.</TE>
<TE>   His initial goal, apparently, was to extract gold from Copper Mountain
in the El Paso range. He planned to use the tunnel he was digging as a
shortcut to the nearest railroad. But that seemed to change soon after
his work began in 1906, according to those who have chronicled his story.</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt kept digging after a new road and new railroad track made the
shortcut unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   "Some 50 feet into the mountain, Schmidt struck potentially valuable
veins of gold, silver, copper and iron," said Evelyn Tonie Seger, who
wrote a profile of him for the book "Odd and Eccentric People." She still
lives in a cabin adjoining Schmidt's shack outside the tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of stopping to exploit the deposits," Seger wrote, "he bored
obsessively onward into the heart of the mountain."</TE>
<TE>   Was Schmidt after an even richer vein that he never found? No one can
be sure. If you walk through the tunnel, as many tourists do, you can see
the rusty-looking veins of low-grade gold ore on the rugged walls.</TE>
<TE>   John Kittell, a store owner from the nearby mining town of Randsburg,
pointed them out one afternoon, trekking through the tunnel with a
flashlight.</TE>
<TE>   "This is where he struck it--and he kept going," Kittell said,
reaching a hand into one dark cavity. "He wanted to have a tunnel."</TE>
<TE>   There is good evidence the tunnel became Schmidt's mission. As you go
deep into the mountain, beyond the point where you can see either exit,
the tunnel narrows. The rock arches and ribs and planes of granite close
in on you.</TE>
<TE>   After digging about a third of a mile, Schmidt made a sharp right
turn. "I think he decided he was running out of time," Kittell said, "and
this was the shortest way out."</TE>
<TE>   By then, Schmidt probably was in his 60s. The last segment of the
tunnel becomes so small you have to squat. It ends by opening onto a
steep ravine with extraordinary views of the distant San Gabriel and
Tehachapi mountains. The silence is so full you can hear the faint gusts
of an afternoon breeze.</TE>
<TE>   Kittell, 70, recalled meeting Schmidt near the end of his life. "The
Human Mole," as he was dubbed in some accounts, was "bent over and
taciturn, living over in Last Chance Canyon," Kittell said.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows how Schmidt felt about his life's work, or exactly how
long it took. Some accounts say he dug for 38 years, but most agree that
he started in 1906 and was done by 1938.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Woonsocket, R.I., Schmidt was said to have come to the desert
to preserve his fragile health. Published accounts claim that his three
brothers and three sisters all died of tuberculosis.</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt dug with only a pick, hammer, hand-held drill--a sharpened
pole several feet long--and dynamite. He would hammer the drill into the
rock far enough to insert the dynamite, then blast.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 2,460 cubic yards of rock were removed, most of it on a
narrow-gauge track and cart that Schmidt pushed by hand.</TE>
<TE>   "All food, water and material had to be packed in during the years the
tunnel was under construction," columnist Pop Lofinck wrote 10 years
after Schmidt's death in the Rocketeer, a weekly paper published by the
China Lake Naval Weapons Station. "No compressed air or gasoline motors.
Think of all that work...."</TE>
<TE>   The cart track still protrudes from the tunnel mouth. Schmidt's
cabin--his home for 45 years--exists much as it did, a one-room plank
house built with scavenged wood. It has a tar-paper roof and a partial
protective shell made of squares of metal from cans of blasting powder.</TE>
<TE>   Scattered outside are discarded wine and brandy bottles, Schmidt's
rusted picks and drills and various rocks and minerals that he unearthed.
His potbelly stove sits inside. He insulated the walls and ceiling by
nailing up newspapers and magazines--a mosaic that includes Collier's and
the Saturday Evening Post, photos of pin-up stars Carole Lombard and
Rosalind Russell, and a page from a 1935 edition of The Times touting a
break in the Lindbergh trial: "Fisch Note Traps Hauptmann."</TE>
<TE>   One wall is filled with Aunt Jemima pancake boxes.</TE>
<TE>   "That was his main diet--pancakes and beans," said David Ayers, who
oversees the landmark while serving as a caretaker for the 93-year-old
Seger. A sign near the two cabins--Seger's and Schmidt's --instructs
tourists to stop and register. The visitor log books go back to 1952.</TE>
<TE>   "Those people are now bringing their own children," Ayers said. On a
good weekend, 50 or more people come up and tour the tunnel, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Seger, who bought her cabin in 1963, nine years after Schmidt died, is
in poor health but apparently determined to live out her days near the
tunnel, surrounded by scrub brush and jack rabbits.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite a place up here, isn't it?" she said. "Can you
imagine--right in the middle of the desert, on top of a mountain, is a
tunnel?"</TE>

<HD>Real Contest May Be Just Getting to Pasadena</HD>
<DH>Events: With the Rose Bowl game starting in the thick of rush hour,
things could get nasty on the freeways.</DH>

<LD>What do you get when you cross 90,000 football fans, many from
Nebraska and Miami, with impatient commuters and some of L.A.'s most
congested roadways?</LD>
<LD>   A possible traffic migraine. Or at least that's what Pasadena police
fear about today's Rose Bowl football game.</LD>
<LD>   Pasadena is sending many of its nonessential city employees home at
noon today. One of the city's biggest corporations is closing down early.
But for many others in and around the area, this evening's commute could
prove to be its own test of endurance. The 5 p.m. Rose Bowl game kickoff,
scheduled for a national television broadcast, will fall in the midst of
the local rush hour.</LD>
<TE>   "This is very serious," said Cmdr. Mary L. Schander of the Pasadena
Police Department. "The game is not on the 1st [of January, a holiday],
it's a work day, and we have two teams whose fans are not familiar with
Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   Leann Lampe, spokeswoman for the usually boosterish Pasadena
Convention and Visitors Bureau, noted: "It's going to be busy, no doubt
about it."</TE>
<TE>   During a typical weekday commute, 10,300 cars an hour travel the
Foothill Freeway near the Rose Bowl, 17,100 use the 134 Freeway and
another 7,900 the winding Pasadena Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   More than 90,000 people are expected to attend today's football game.
Many are from out of town, and "it's somewhat unpredictable to say where
they are staying and where they are coming from, if it's Santa Monica or
Santa Clarita," Schander said.</TE>
<TE>   Parking for fans at the Rose Bowl is limited, she added, and security
at the game will be tight, adding to time it will take people to get to
their stadium seats.</TE>
<TE>   Event organizers are encouraging people going to the game to arrive
earlier in the day, before rush hour begins.</TE>
<TE>   Parking lots around the Rose Bowl open at 8 a.m. today, and a free
shuttle from the Parsons parking lot at 100 W. Walnut St. will begin
ferrying passengers to the game at 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, organizers hope that a $30-a-person, pregame "Rose Bowl
Experience" will entice game-goers to arrive at the stadium well before
kickoff. The "interactive football theme park," as it is being billed,
runs from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., and will feature musical performances by Big
Bad Voodoo Daddy and K.C. and the Sunshine Band.</TE>

<TE>   Rose Bowl parking and directions. S9</TE>
<TE>   "This is not going to catch anyone by surprise," said Darryl Dunn,
general manager of the Rose Bowl. "But it's still a workday."</TE>
<TE>   Margie Tiritilli, a spokeswoman for the California Department of
Transportation, said that all routes around the Rose Bowl will be open to
traffic, with no planned lane, ramp or freeway closures.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Ricardo Quintero of the California Highway Patrol said CHP
officers will be assisting Pasadena police in escorting team members and
VIPs into and out of the Rose Bowl. But "as far as the freeways," he
said, "we don't have anything planned. If a problem comes up, they will
handle it."</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Parade and the Rose Bowl game traditionally are both on Jan.
1. But college football officials moved the game to Jan. 3 this year as
part of a new bowl championship series intended to determine a national
champion.</TE>
<TE>   Many people used the day in between to view the floats, on display on
Sierra Madre Boulevard in northeast Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Burskey said he could relate to the Rockin' Rollers float,
consisting of four animated caveman figures playing musical instruments.
"I'm a caveman at heart," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockin' Rollers' wildly colored hair was made of straw flowers,
silk grass and moss. They jammed to tunes such as Queen's "We Will Rock
You."</TE>
<TE>   Burskey, his brother Rob and their mother Joyce were among the
thousands who came to gawk at the 53 floats. The brothers, who live in
Van Nuys, were making their first trip to the float showcase and brought
their mother, who is vacationing in the Southland from Washington state.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't it a shame that we've never come before?" Rob Burskey said.
"I'd just thought it would be neat to see them up close for a change."</TE>
<TE>   Another set of brothers shared some quality time with their mother.
Nicholas McCoy, 1, and Nathan McCoy, 3, were taking it all in from a
stroller.</TE>
<TE>   "They love it," said their mother, Lena McCoy of San Dimas, who said
she comes every year to see the float display and is never disappointed.
"It's all so beautiful," she said. "Every year it seems like they become
more and more elaborate."</TE>
<TE>   Sprinkled among the crowd were a good number of Nebraska natives,
decked out in red sweatshirts to support their beloved Cornhuskers, who
take on top-ranked Miami today in the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte Miller of Lincoln, Neb., who said she follows the team
everywhere, said she was glad she made it to the showcase, where she was
looking at a float built to function as a carousel.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is so amazing and the people have been so friendly and
considerate," she said.</TE>

<HD>Secessionists Offer Lower Cost Estimate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Fernando Valley secessionists asserted Wednesday that they can
set up a city for hundreds of millions of dollars less than previously
estimated.</LD>
<LD>   The Local Agency Formation Commission, the agency studying secession,
has estimated that a new Valley city would face $1 billion in costs for
services. But the secession group Valley VOTE released a much lower
preliminary estimate of $626 million a year for three years.</LD>
<LD>   Walter Kieser of the consulting firm Economic &amp; Planning Systems Inc.,
which provided the new estimate, said the analysis is based on an
evaluation of calculations made by a LAFCO consultant.</LD>
<TE>   Kieser said the new analysis reduces the costs to account for hundreds
of unfilled positions that are currently budgeted by Los Angeles to serve
the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The report, which will be a basis for drafting a more formal budget,
was met with skepticism at Los Angeles City Hall.</TE>

<LD>An unidentified South Los Angeles resident was critically burned in
an explosion caused by a natural gas leak Tuesday night, a Los Angeles
Fire Department spokesman said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The blast shortly after 9 p.m. also displaced three families from the
apartment building in the 1400 block of West Martin Luther King
Boulevard, spokesman Bob Kholos said.</LD>
<LD>   Although Kholos said the man was taken to Daniel Freeman Memorial
Hospital in Inglewood for treatment of third-degree burns, a hospital
spokesman said she could not confirm that he was there.</LD>
<TE>   Mike Dickson of the Fire Department said the building is now unsafe
and will be condemned.</TE>

<HD>Veteran Prosecutor to Become Chief Deputy D.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A veteran prosecutor and defense lawyer will become Los Angeles
County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley's new second-in-command.</LD>
<LD>   Curt Livesay, 61, who was interim chief deputy district attorney
during the first few months of Cooley's administration last year before
retiring in May, will resume that job permanently effective Jan. 22.</LD>
<LD>   As chief deputy, he will be responsible for the day-to-day operations
of the 3,700-employee office.</LD>
<TE>   He will replace Lawrence Mason, who succeeded Livesay in May. Mason
will become a senior special assistant and judicial liaison.</TE>
<TE>   Livesay, with more than 35 years as a prosecutor and defense lawyer,
held a variety of management positions in previous administrations,
including as former Dist. Atty. John Van de Kamp's chief deputy from 1978
to 1983. In all, he worked in five district attorney administrations.</TE>
<TE>   "He brings to the office excellent judgment, as well as a wealth of
institutional knowledge and experience," Cooley said in an internal memo
distributed to his staff.</TE>
<TE>   Livesay's supervisory background fills a weakness that many critics
cited in Mason's background. Mason was a deputy district attorney for 22
years before becoming a Municipal Court judge in 1997. But he had little
management experience before Cooley hired him last year as an assistant
district attorney and then as a chief deputy.</TE>
<TE>   Mason, 65, said he doesn't view his new assignment as a demotion.</TE>
<TE>   "I am here to serve Mr. Cooley in whatever way I can," Mason said.
"It's a good thing for this office that Mr. Livesay is able to come back
here because of his vast amount of experience."</TE>
<TE>   Livesay became a prosecutor in 1965 and worked his way up to head
deputy of the juvenile division, assistant district attorney and chief
deputy. For more than 10 years, he controlled the process for deciding
whether the death penalty would be sought in murder cases.</TE>
<TE>   He retired from the district attorney's office in 1991 after serving
as one of former Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner's top assistants and went into
private practice. He returned to the district attorney's office last year
to help Cooley organize his administration.</TE>

<HD>$4.5-Million Study Will Seek Ways to Cut Gridlock on the 101
Freeway</HD>
<DH>Transit: Several agencies are backing the analysis, but longtime
commuters doubt traffic will lessen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new study of the 101 Freeway hailed as the most comprehensive
analysis ever of this nightmare of a commuting artery is underway, a
consortium of government agencies announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The $4.5-million, three-year effort seeks to reduce congestion and
improve safety along the 40-mile stretch from downtown Los Angeles
through Hollywood, crossing the San Fernando Valley to Thousand Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers will seek public input through three community meetings
this month. But the study already is being greeted with skepticism by
commuters who have grown weary of studies done on everything from
interchange improvements to double-decking the freeway to building a
trolley line along the median.</LD>
<TE>   "Not only do studies come and go, not only has there been no action,
the problems [on the 101] are getting worse and worse," said Richard
Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. "When will the
studies end and the constructions begin?"</TE>
<TE>   Supporters said the new study will be different and may lead to
change.</TE>
<TE>   One of the busiest corridors in California, the 101--also known as the
Ventura Freeway along one stretch and the Hollywood Freeway along
another--is often gridlocked in both directions during peak commuting
hours. The freeway channels traffic to and from downtown, Burbank movie
studios, the Van Nuys government complex and Warner Center in Woodland
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The 101 is home to two of California's three busiest interchanges,
where it grinds across the Harbor Freeway downtown and the San Diego
Freeway in Sherman Oaks, said Tom Choe, chief of freeway operations for
Caltrans. Only the interchange between the Harbor and Santa Monica
freeways near downtown has more traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The study "is not going to be just another study," said state Sen.
Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica), who helped secure much of its funding when
she was in the Assembly. Unlike previous analyses, this one will seek
public input, examine the entire corridor rather than bits and pieces of
it and identify short-term as well as long-term solutions, Kuehl said.
Another goal is to identify funding sources.</TE>
<TE>   The study is being conducted by Parsons Brinckerhoff Inc., an
engineering consulting firm headquartered in New York with offices
throughout California. It is being funded with $3 million from Gov. Gray
Davis' Traffic Congestion Relief Program and additional money from
Caltrans, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Las Virgenes-Malibu
Council of Governments and the Southern California Assn. of Governments.</TE>
<TE>   Community meetings will be held from 6 to 8 p.m. on Jan. 22 at Encino
Tarzana Medical Center, 16237 Ventura Blvd., Encino; on Jan. 23 at
Calabasas Community Center, 27040 Malibu Hills Road, Calabasas; and on
Jan. 24 at Los Angeles City College, 855 N. Vermont Ave., Los Angeles.

668-3101.</TE>

<LD>Police are searching for a truckload of nitric acid stolen from a
business Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The acid was in five 100-pound canisters on the back of a truck at 535

<LD>A Los Angeles man has been charged with illegally possessing
explosive devices and igniting a powerful firecracker that blew off part
of a dog's jaw.</LD>
<LD>   Gil Raul Delara, 19, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to 12 felony counts,
said Sandi Gibbons of the district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Delara is charged with 11 counts of recklessly possessing a
destructive device and explosive in public and one count of animal
cruelty. He was in county jail in lieu of $500,000 bail and is scheduled
to appear Jan. 9 in Compton Superior Court.</LD>
<TE>   The dog, which appeared to be a German shepherd, was taken to a
veterinary hospital, where it was euthanized, said Officer Jack Richter,
an LAPD spokesman.</TE>

<LD>Ninety-four-year-old Sophie Gobbi of Laguna Woods relayed this
shopping experience of her friend, Doris Miller. It seems that Doris was
in a line of folks waiting for their food orders to be prepared and
mentioned to a woman in front that it was her birthday.</LD>
<LD>   The woman asked: "Are you 52?"</LD>
<LD>   "Fifty-two?!" replied a delighted Doris. "No, my dear, I'm 85, not
52."</LD>
<TE>   And her delight was only slightly dimmed when she realized the woman
was asking her what her order number was.</TE>
<TE>   Offsides! Peter Lee believes the Pasadena Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau
should be penalized for wishful thinking when it published a magazine ad
in December implying that UCLA would be playing in today's Rose Bowl for
the national championship (see photo). As any USC fan can tell you, the
Bruins (rhymes with "ruins") lost their last four games to fall out of
contention.</TE>
<TE>   Day-tripping: Chuck Dapoz of Manhattan Beach wonders if the switching
of the Rose Bowl game from Jan. 1 to today--Jan. 3--caused one branch of
Washington Mutual bank to forget what day New Year's Day is (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Great chases of 2001: One of the wackiest criminal pursuits of the
past year involved a hit-and-run suspect who was stopped in Lakewood. He
allegedly jumped out of his truck and yelled, "Watch out, it's going to
blow!"--then jumped back inside and sped off.</TE>
<TE>   A sheriff's deputy began coordinating nearby sheriff's units, said
Star News, a department publication, but she "was at a loss when the
driver drove through the east fence of the Long Beach Airport and onto
the runway."</TE>
<TE>   As the Star News pointed out: "Just saying that 'he's driving on 25
Right or Runway 33' isn't familiar" to most deputies.</TE>
<TE>   Airline traffic was briefly disrupted. Luckily, the truck soon
overturned, spilling its load--of porcelain toilets.</TE>
<TE>   Incredible as it seems: Barry Socher saw a car with the license plate
GAB and, he says, " the driver was not talking on a cell phone."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, it wasn't an L.A. driver. The car was from out of state.</TE>
<TE>   He had the guacamole blues: The police log of the Westsider newspaper
reported that, following a purchase, an angry restaurant customer
"demanded more salsa. The employee gave the assailant the salsa, and the
assailant demanded guacamole. When the employee told the assailant he
would have to pay for the guacamole, the assailant became angry and threw
the salsa."</TE>

<TE>   Dan Figueroa was puzzled by a National Weather Service advisory that
warned of "a large blob of moisture" headed this way last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Thank goodness it wasn't the same gooey glop from outer space that
Steve McQueen battled in the movie "The Blob" (1958).</TE>
<TE>   The danger--whatever it was--passed. And, yes, I chose not to mention
it until now out of fear of alarming the populace. I'm still not sure I
should have mentioned the flying salsa.</TE>

<HD>Sexual Responsibility Activist Takes His Message to Male Turf</HD>
<DH>Health: Advocate talks about condoms, disease, vasectomies. His
efforts seem to be working, as more men visit Pasadena clinic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA E. BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Adam Arzate was in eighth grade, he came home from school one
day to find a bag of condoms waiting for him.</LD>
<LD>   "Hey, what's up with the condoms?" he asked his mother, Yolanda, who
is a community outreach worker at Planned Parenthood of Pasadena. She
told him that they were for him or his friends.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't want to have to go through this later, so I'll tell you about
it now," she said.</LD>
<TE>   After that, Arzate gained a reputation among his friends as the guy
they could ask.</TE>
<TE>   His young days as a sex-education intermediary were training for the
now-26-year-old's current full-time gig as "male advocate" for Planned
Parenthood of Pasadena's Community Outreach Program. His mother told him
about the position, which the organization had been trying to fill for
months.</TE>
<TE>   Arzate spends the early part of his day walking and driving around,
talking to men. He might begin in Pasadena's Villa Park, chatting in
Spanish with day laborers about sexually transmitted infections. He'll
hand out some fliers and condoms. He might make some contacts.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the day, Arzate will continue to hit spots that men in the
area frequent, including community sporting leagues. He has been known to
shoot some hoops, then give a talk about safe sex. Some days, Arzate will
make three to four presentations to groups or schools that request them.</TE>
<TE>   In a pilot program using federal funds for family planning, Arzate was
hired to reach a portion of the population that the nonprofit
organization just wasn't attracting: men. Now, after a year of
presentations, basketball games and contacts, Planned Parenthood is
seeing results. The group recently made a successful bid for another year
of funding.</TE>
<TE>   "We went from seeing very few males to about 110 last year," said Beth
Calleton, chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Pasadena. "I suspect
that this year the number will be over 200. But [Arzate] also reaches
others who may not become clinic clients, but who may now use condoms.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to get young males to use clinics," she said. "We wanted to
do something more than the usual treatment for [sexually transmitted]
infections."</TE>
<TE>   When he talks to men in the community, Arzate's charge is to get them
to take responsibility for their overall health, not just their sexual
health. He also encourages them to be good partners.</TE>
<TE>   "Men have to be responsible. They don't have to be men having babies
left and right with different babies' mamas," Arzate said. The ultimate
goal is to have men return twice a year for regular health screenings and
checkups.</TE>
<TE>   Arzate tells people that finances shouldn't be an obstacle. As of this
month, the state will reimburse Pasadena's Planned Parenthood for health
services for men who qualify. The clinic uses a sliding fee scale based
on income.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody is turned away," he tells them.</TE>
<TE>   So why is it still so hard to get men to come in?</TE>
<TE>   "Most men won't get a checkup unless something is seriously wrong.
We're targeting the at-risk population: those who keep having babies
before they're ready and escalating their chances of sexually transmitted
infections," Arzate said.</TE>
<TE>   That's why having him talk with clients man to man seems to be
helping.</TE>
<TE>   At 6-foot-1 and dressed in a guayabera shirt, black pants and black
boots, Arzate wears an inch-thick silver chain around his neck. With a
matching chain around his wrist and a carefully sculpted goatee, he can
blend in as just one of the guys--albeit a knowledgeable one.</TE>
<TE>   That seems to help during talks about another service at Planned
Parenthood: vasectomies. He admits that the subject is a tough one to
broach among men wary of health services.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the easiest ways to get to them is through a financial point
of view," he said. "I try to open their eyes to how they can save money
and be able to provide their families with what they need."</TE>
<TE>   Arzate cites one client as an example of a triumph.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a 60-year-old from Mexico who had 12 kids from different
wives. He was working on divorce No. 4," Arzate recalled. He asked the
man if he planned on having more children. When the man said no, Arzate
suggested a vasectomy.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy was convinced that a vasectomy was a castration, because he
had worked on a farm in Mexico," Arzate recalled. But after a long
discussion, Arzate won him over. A week later the man began the screening
process to qualify for the free service. The next week, he had the
vasectomy. Arzate said the man sent him a thank-you note and has appeared
for regular checkups ever since.</TE>
<TE>   The day a man gets a vasectomy can be frightening. That's why Arzate
is there, to take a man's vital signs and to calm the squeamish client
before he goes in to see the female nurse.</TE>
<TE>   But there also is work to be done with the younger generation. He
recently made a presentation to a group of ninth- to 12th-graders at Rose
City High School, a public Pasadena campus that provides alternative
learning strategies for those who perform poorly in traditional
educational environments.</TE>
<TE>   A table of boys sitting near the front acted uninterested, even when
Arzate peppered his talk with slang terms and exchanged colloquialisms
for technical terminology. But after the class was dismissed, the boys
lingered, asking questions, finding out where the clinics are located.</TE>
<TE>   "His presence makes the boys feel a lot more comfortable; they are
able to ask questions and he speaks their vernacular," said Karen Smith,
nurse practitioner at Rose City. "They relate to him. He brings a male
perspective that is missing in a lot of homes and where these boys hang
out."</TE>
<TE>   'Men have to be responsible. They don't have to be men having babies
left and right with different babies' mamas.'</TE>

<DH>Environment: Proposal targets stretch of Santa Clara River polluted
by oil spilled in '94 quake.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Environmental officials on Wednesday released a draft plan to
restore a 16-mile stretch of the Santa Clara River that was damaged when
an oil pipeline ruptured during the 1994 Northridge earthquake, sending
tens of thousands of gallons of oil into the watershed.</LD>
<LD>   "This work can bring damaged ecosystems back to their pre-spill
condition, so wildlife can flourish there," said Harlan Henderson, an
administrator with the state Fish and Game Department's Office of Spill
Prevention and Response.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal was developed by Fish and Game and the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service.</LD>
<TE>   Several restoration projects are listed in the draft plan, including
the purchase of land along the river and establishment of permanent
conservation easements, the control of invasive nonnative plant species
and continuous monitoring.</TE>
<TE>   A $7.1-million settlement paid by Arco after the earthquake will fund
the restoration projects.</TE>
<TE>   About 190,000 gallons of oil damaged or destroyed about 100 acres of
plants and 150 acres of river sediment and killed an undetermined number
of fish, bird and wildlife species, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The 130-mile Four Corners Pipe Line runs from Kern County oil fields
to South Bay refineries. During the magnitude 6.8 temblor, the
10-inch-diameter pipe ruptured in several places, causing spills into the
Santa Clara River near Valencia and a leak near O'Melveny Elementary
School in San Fernando, which fueled fires that destroyed cars and homes.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement under the federal Oil Pollution Act stipulates that
funds must be used for habitat rehabilitation, vegetation replacement and
protection of Santa Clara River watershed and wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   The 100-mile river, which flows from the San Gabriel Mountains to the
ocean, is one of the last natural river systems in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The river's watershed covers about 1,600 square miles and supports
endangered and threatened species such as the western snowy plover, least
Bell's vireo and arroyo toad.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is wonderful that finally a plan is coming out because
people were concerned about where the money went from the settlement,"
said Lynne Plambeck, president of the citizens group Santa Clarita
Organization for Planning and the Environment.</TE>
<TE>   A public meeting on the plan is scheduled for 4 p.m. Jan. 15 at Robert
J. Lagomarsino Visitor Center, Channel Islands National Park, 1901
Spinnaker Drive, Ventura.</TE>

<HD>Postal Service Stamps Out Mailbox Misuse at Mobile Homes</HD>
<DH>Edict: Officials halt use of boxes for notes, rent statements and
other messages, sans postage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HICKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For more than 25 years, the residents of the Orange Crest Mobile
Home Park in Orange had a handy way of communicating with each other:
their mailboxes. Things such as personal notes, monthly newsletters,
bridge notices, greeting cards, clubroom party announcements, sympathy
cards. Management even used the mailbox for monthly rent statements.</LD>
<LD>   No more. The U.S. Postal Service is on to them and has put a stop to
the practice.</LD>
<LD>   Since the edict came down six weeks ago, the tightknit community has
been a bit riled. A resident apparently had complained to the local post
office about all the mailbox items without stamps. Postal authorities
immediately called park management.</LD>
<TE>   "It's ridiculous," said Thelma Rinker, who has lived in the neatly
kept, walled community of 89 units almost since it opened in 1975. "But
if the government says 'jump,' I guess you jump."</TE>
<TE>   But instead of jumping, Rinker spent $30 on a second mailbox for
neighborhood correspondence and placed it below her regular one. Nearly
half of the residents did likewise.</TE>
<TE>   But not Robert E. Davis, who has lived there 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just too stubborn," said Davis, 77, a retired newspaperman. He's
the unofficial ombudsman for the park, made up mostly of senior citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Davis has started a letter-writing campaign to get the postal
orders changed. To his dismay, he's learning that he probably won't win.</TE>
<TE>   It happens to be an issue the U.S. Postal Service has strong feelings
about. It falls under U.S. Code, Section 1725. And in more specific
language, Domestic Mail Manual D041-1.3 says, "No part of a mail
receptacle may be used to deliver any matter not bearing postage."</TE>
<TE>   Linda Dalton, consumer affairs manager for the Postal Service, wrote
to Davis that she hoped the majority would agree that the statute and the
postal regulations "further the public interest."</TE>
<TE>   The problem dates from the early 1930s, when utility companies
delivered their bills by mailbox through their own employees out reading
meters. The Postal Service saw a huge drop in revenue and decided to act.
Enforcement became even more important in 1970, Dalton wrote, when
Congress mandated that the Postal Service be self-sustaining.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognize that, from time to time, the regulations may cause
owners of mailboxes to become irritated," Dalton said. "I apologize that
this is inconvenient, but it must be uniformly enforced."</TE>
<TE>   To which Davis replied by mail: "Phooey."</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't our job to produce revenue for the Postal Service," Davis
said. He has since written to several members of Congress, but none has
responded.</TE>
<TE>   The issue has come up many times before, said Terri Bouffiou, the
Postal Service's Southern California spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   "We have Realtors who like to flood local mailboxes with the news that
they've sold a home in the neighborhood, a little free advertising
without paying postage," she said. "Or the Avon lady dropping off mailbox
notices that she'll soon be in the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "We just can't have people putting their hands in other people's
mailboxes, because there's a flip side to that. They could be taking
something out."</TE>
<TE>   Postal inspectors are kept busy investigating cases in which scam
artists have gleaned personal information about residents by stealing
from their mailboxes, Bouffiou said. Thefts of Social Security checks
from mailboxes are common too.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't live in a simple world anymore," she said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Bouffiou offers a compromise to the mobile home park: Go
ahead and use the mailboxes for your rent notices, or monthly
newsletters: Just put the proper postage on it, as if you'd gone through
the post office.</TE>
<TE>   The Postal Service doesn't plan to sue anyone unless it gets word of
repeat offenders. Bouffiou said she expects the mobile home park
residents to abide by its new notice on the honor system. Even though
they're unhappy, they're dutifully doing that.</TE>

<HD>Veterans Want Museum Put in Blimp Hangar</HD>
<DH>Military: Orange County will study the proposal for the site at the
vacant Tustin Marine base.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The cavernous hangars at the deserted Tustin Marine base--historic
leftovers from another era--are a planner's challenge.</LD>
<LD>   Eighteen stories high, the structures are so enormous that blimps--as
many as six at a time--once were housed inside. The hangars are now
historic sites. They also are empty, except for pigeons that flap through
the airy buildings.</LD>
<LD>   So what do you do with a World War II blimp hangar? Thoughts vary. One
idea: a movie sound stage. Another suggestion calls for college
classrooms; still another, a homeless shelter.</LD>
<TE>   Bill Mannes, a war veteran, sees a military museum.</TE>
<TE>   Mannes is president of the United Veterans Organization, which wants
to convert the northern hangar into a military museum with exhibits that
chronicle life in wartime and pay homage to the county's 250,000
veterans. So far, though, county supervisors have agreed only to study
the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that there's a reawakening of interest in the
military services," Mannes said. "Just look around the county and see how
many homes are flying U.S. flags and how many people are attending
veterans events. Something like this would help keep that feeling of
patriotism going."</TE>
<TE>   The hangar, according to plans, would be filled with thousands of
items donated by about 40 private collectors: planes, tanks, trucks,
Jeeps, uniforms and photographs.</TE>
<TE>   Museum organizers have received $2 million worth of vintage tanks,
landing craft, uniforms and other equipment that was restored for the
movie "Windtalkers," a recently completed Nicolas Cage drama about U.S.
Marines assigned to protect Navajo encryption experts in the Pacific
during World War II. The items are being stored in a lot outside the
county's Veterans Service Office in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the museum displays would involve World War II.</TE>
<TE>   "We're focusing on World War II because it's a part of history we can
still capture," said Ron Melendez, a Vietnam veteran who is the museum's
lead organizer. "A lot of these guys are still alive, and we can get a
real sense of what it was like to be there."</TE>
<TE>   Melendez said he hopes to make the displays realistic and interactive.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want rooms with glass cases and uniforms," he said. "We're
planning on a room that will be like a World War I trench, where you'll
have to look over edges of the trench to see the display. Our intent is
to have a mock destroyer docked at Pearl Harbor and then show a troop
transport."</TE>
<TE>   Visitors would be able to see what prisoners of war experienced.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll be able to get in the cage where a POW [might have] stayed
and see the amount of food they are given," said Carol Hatch, a special
project manager for the county.</TE>
<TE>   The first two planned phases of the project will cover World War II,
with subsequent additions centering on earlier conflicts--possibly as far
back as the Revolutionary War--and more on the wars in Vietnam and Korea.
As the county studies the cost and practicality of converting a
291,000-square-foot blimp hangar into a museum, Melendez hopes that his
group can use an adjacent building on the old base as an interim site.</TE>
<TE>   Melendez hopes that a makeshift museum can be opened at the interim
site by late spring with the hangar conversion completed by early 2003.</TE>
<TE>   But nothing moves very fast at the mothballed air station, which has
been closed for three years. The northern hangar anchors the southeast
corner of the county's 84.5-acre parcel, which has been designated for
public parks, a homeless shelter, an animal shelter and a Sheriff's
Department training facility.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the land, which will eventually be turned over to the city
of Tustin, is intended for homes, a golf course, several schools and a
commercial business park. The Santa Ana Unified School District wants
some of the land for schools.</TE>
<TE>   Both hangars are on the National Register of Historic Places. They
were completed in October 1943.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer said he has always supported the concept of a
military museum on the former Tustin Marine Corps Air Station.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said the county could help pay for the redesign and
maintenance of the northern hangar by renting it for dinners, banquets
and even weddings.</TE>
<TE>   "The blimp hangar is a phenomenal structure," he said. "I couldn't
think of any better place for this museum."</TE>
<TE>   Organizers hope that the museum will host school field trips and
Veterans Day ceremonies.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get this built," Mannes said, "it would be unrivaled in the
Western part of the country for military museums."</TE>

<HD>Bush to Visit Inland Empire</HD>
<DH>Politics: President is expected to hold a town hall meeting in
Ontario, officials say. Security-conscious White House declines to
confirm the event.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush is poised to make his third trip to California since
his election, appearing this weekend in Ontario for a town hall-style
meeting, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The event has not been officially announced. Since the terrorist
attacks, the White House has been tight-lipped about the president's
travel schedule and releases details at the last minute only. White House
spokeswoman Lani Miller said the event was not on the president's
schedule as of Wednesday evening.</LD>
<LD>   But several officials in San Bernardino County and elsewhere said Bush
is scheduled to hold the meeting Saturday morning at the Ontario
Convention Center.</LD>
<TE>   The president has been at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, since Dec. 26
and plans to return to the White House on Monday. He will apparently
travel to California from Austin, Texas, where he will be on Friday. From
Ontario, he will fly to Portland, Ore., where he will tour a job center
and speak at a high school, said White House aides.</TE>
<TE>   David Aldana of the Ontario Convention Center said local officials
were told to expect between 3,500 and 5,000 people for the event. Ontario
Police Department officials were meeting with the Secret Service late
Wednesday to coordinate security.</TE>
<TE>   "We offer all the services of our department to the Secret Service for
the protection of our president," said Ontario Police Det. Mike Macias.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has held several town hall meetings in recent months, typically
sitting before a hand-picked and adoring audience.</TE>
<TE>   In November, he used the format to trade accolades with Russian
President Vladimir V. Putin. In December, he used it to reaffirm his
resolve to end global terrorism and to defend the use of secret military
tribunals to prosecute people implicated in the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's scheduled appearance in Ontario is also part of his
administration's efforts to refocus on his domestic agenda, especially
the economy, even while pursuing the counter-terrorism campaign. Bush's
father lost a bid for reelection despite a surge in popularity from the
Persian Gulf War--largely because he was accused of ignoring domestic
affairs and the impact of an economic downturn.</TE>
<TE>   The younger Bush's last trip to California was in October, when he
stopped briefly in Sacramento en route to China.</TE>
<TE>   The president's first visit came in May. Critics pointed out that he
had already visited 29 states before setting foot in the nation's most
populous--which he lost to Democrat Al Gore by more than 1 million votes
in the 2000 election.</TE>
<TE>   The May trip featured several visits before friendly audiences, but a
private meeting with Gov. Gray Davis generated the most interest.</TE>
<TE>   The two leaders clashed over energy policy. Davis charged that Bush
offered little assistance to California as the state faced what was, at
the time, a harrowing energy crisis. Some were also irked when Bush
declined to meet with a group of "real Californians" whom Davis had
chosen to illustrate the impact of rising electric bills.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, in an apparent dig at the Davis administration, Bush
said energy policy "requires action" and that "blame-shifting is not
action, it's a distraction."</TE>

<HD>Students Killed in Crash Mourned</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly 1,000 friends and family members attended a joint funeral
Wednesday for two popular Westlake High School students killed in a car
crash three days after Christmas.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan Alexander Bass and Kenneth Marshall Glass, both 16, were
remembered as good students and good friends, with Bass an aspiring
musician and Glass an athlete who dreamed of studying business or
engineering.</LD>
<LD>   The close friendships the two youths and their families enjoyed with
many of those gathered for the service at Calvary Community Church in
Westlake Village was much in evidence.</LD>
<TE>   The Rev. Craig Beeker left the altar and walked among a large
contingent of Westlake High students, teachers and coaches as John
Lennon's "Beautiful Boy" began to play from speakers overhead.</TE>
<TE>   The two students were killed Friday when a car driven by Glass
careened out of control and hit a brick wall on Westlake Boulevard near
Hillcrest Drive.</TE>
<TE>   Two others in the car, Westlake High students Joshua Kuai and Jenae
Chu, both 16, survived the crash. Kuai attended Wednesday's service.</TE>
<TE>   "They were my best friends and I feel really bad about what happened,"
said Kuai, who was wearing a thickly padded neck brace. "I feel like I
got off easy."</TE>
<TE>   Glass was a member of the basketball and volleyball teams at the
school and had hopes of studying engineering or business at Columbia
University after graduation in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Bass was a rock guitarist who performed in a garage band called Trase.
He was also a golfer with plans to play on the UCLA team.</TE>
<TE>   But the two were much more than good students who passed their spare
time as a jock and a guitar player, according to those who knew them
best.</TE>
<TE>   During eulogies that lasted nearly 2 1/2 hours, friends and relatives
of the two teens described the little things that were shaping the two
boys into young men.</TE>
<TE>   Bass' mother, Cheryl, spoke directly to Kuai, seated in the front row.
"Jenae and Joshua, we know God has a plan for you because you survived
this," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Hung high above the altar were pictures of the two friends.</TE>
<TE>   Several classmates read poems seeking reasons for the two deaths.
Beeker, the pastor at Westlake Lutheran Church, cautioned against asking
questions "that have no answers."</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Westlake High basketball team promised to dedicate the
rest of the season in the memory of Glass.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Glass said his son had the temperament of someone who would
never give up.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to be the leader, to control a company one day," Craig
Glass said. "But bad luck and bad judgment got in the way."</TE>

<HD>GOP Foe of Davis Urges Free Lottery Drawing</HD>
<DH>Politics: Candidate Bill Jones attacks state over admission that
ineligible tickets were sold.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIRGINIA ELLIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>The lottery will surface as a new issue in the gubernatorial
campaign today as Republican candidate Bill Jones calls for a free
$1-million drawing to compensate players who bought Scratchers tickets
that weren't eligible for prizes.</LD>
<LD>   In a bit of political comeuppance, Jones will call for the resignation
of Gov. Gray Davis' Lottery Commission, contending that the five members
knew or should have known that tickets for some games were being sold
when purchasers had no chance of winning the top prizes.</LD>
<LD>   "Folks, that is fraud," Jones said in prepared remarks. "If a
private-sector company engaged in that type of activity, they would be
heavily fined."</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for the state-run games of chance said Wednesday that
officials did not know about the problem with the Scratchers tickets
until a lawsuit was filed on behalf of some players, and that they
corrected it immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Lottery spokesman Vince Montane said Jones' proposal for a free
drawing sounds much like plans already underway at the lottery, which
will hold a $1-million second-chance drawing in February for anyone with
tickets from past or current games.</TE>
<TE>   "If that's what he's proposing, we're already doing that," Montane
said. "That will be our way of going back and saying 'Gee, there was a
problem and we have rectified it.' "</TE>
<TE>   The use of the lottery as a campaign tool copies a successful strategy
that Davis employed in previous elections and during his tenure as state
controller.</TE>
<TE>   When he opened his campaign for governor, Davis said he wanted to
institute an annual audit of the lottery because of a widespread belief
that it was badly managed and had failed to provide all the promised
revenue for education.</TE>
<TE>   In the 17 years since voters approved the California Lottery Act, the
games of chance have frequently been a source of controversy because they
have never been the boon to education that promoters promised.</TE>
<TE>   Under law, at least 34% of lottery revenue goes to schools and
universities, but that provides only a small percentage of the money
needed to run them.</TE>
<TE>   The latest controversy stems from revelations that the lottery had
continued to sell Scratchers tickets to some games after all the grand
prizes had been awarded.</TE>
<TE>   Officials later admitted that in 11 of the 137 games played since 1996
some tickets had been sold that were not eligible for top prizes.</TE>
<TE>   They noted that the problem dated back to the administration of
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Jones said his proposal for a $1-million drawing
differs from the lottery's promotion because it would not require players
to purchase any tickets to get a free ticket.</TE>
<TE>   Jones will announce his plan today at a news conference at the Rancho
Jr. Market, a Burbank convenience store that sells Scratchers tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Scratchers, which allows players to see if they are winners by
scratching off the ticket's surface, is the lottery's most popular game.</TE>

<HD>Rain Causes Flooding, Mudslides and Traffic Snarls in Northern
California</HD>
<DH>Weather: San Francisco, which had its wettest December since 1955,
gets several more inches. Snow delights Lake Tahoe skiers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>The Bay Area and much of the rest of Northern California continued
to feel the cold slap of winter Wednesday as heavy rains caused flooding,
mudslides and nervous glances toward the region's rivers, which continued
to rise near overflow levels.</LD>
<LD>   Several flooded roads in Sonoma County were closed, and potholes and
erosion caused rural segments of California 1 to close, backing up
traffic and fraying nerves, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The storm poured several inches of rain on San Francisco, where the
10.75-inch total for last month made it the wettest December since 1955,
officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the nasty weather to the north, Southern California will be
spared most of the rain, forecasters said.</TE>
<TE>   "The storm will move off to the east, and Los Angeles weather should
be pretty dry after Wednesday night," said Jeremy Nelson of Weather
Central Inc.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, the rains Wednesday afternoon uprooted a
100-foot-tall tree that fell across four lanes in Presidio Park leading
to the Golden Gate Bridge, striking the rear of a bus and backing up
traffic more than an hour. No one on the bus was injured.</TE>
<TE>   "The rain has been pretty consistent," said Lt. Larry Doherty of the
Sonoma County Sheriff's Department. "The rivers are rising, but I don't
think they're going to crest to flood stage. Still, it's not even
February yet--that's when things really get wet around here."</TE>
<TE>   The National Weather Service reported at least 5 inches of rain in the
mountains of central Sonoma County on Tuesday and Wednesday. No
additional rain was expected through next Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Weather forecasters issued a snow advisory for elevations above 7,000
feet in the Lake Tahoe area, where up to a foot of snow was predicted. As
much as 4 inches was expected around the lake, to the delight of skiers
who had decided to extend their New Year's stays.</TE>
<TE>   But for many, the weather just meant more headaches--mostly in rural
areas.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy mountain snows stranded many drivers, even those with snow
chains and four-wheel-drive vehicles. In spots along California 1 in
Sonoma County, roads were washed out and traffic was reduced to one lane.
California 121 and 116 were closed with up to 10 inches of water,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The rains also shut down several popular back country campsites near
Guerneville along the Russian River, frustrating hikers.</TE>
<TE>   A flood warning for the Napa River at St. Helena issued early
Wednesday was lifted at 8:30 a.m. after the river began receding.</TE>
<TE>   At dusk Wednesday, many residents of Sonoma and Napa counties saw the
sun emerge for the first time in days.</TE>
<TE>   "All this rain just gets under your skin after a while," said Mark
Berube, a street maintenance supervisor for the Santa Rosa Department of
Public Works. "It gets depressing. I'm looking forward to seeing a little
sunshine in the next few days."</TE>
<TE>   Just before 2 p.m., a tree whose roots were loosened by the downpour
fell across a major artery leading to the Golden Gate Bridge.</TE>
<TE>   "The rain definitely caused that tree to fall," said Mary Currie, a
spokeswoman for the Golden Gate Transportation District. "The tree
clipped a bus, but thankfully no one was injured. The only way we could
open the road was to have some bridge workers remove the tree with chain
saws."</TE>
<TE>   But for all the wet weather, grape growers in Napa and Sonoma counties
said the rain didn't threaten the region's cash crop. Most of the harvest
was already in, and the rains only delayed winter preparations in many
soggy fields.</TE>
<TE>   "Grape harvest is over for the season, so this is a downtime for a lot
of growers," said Jeri Hansen, a spokeswoman for the Napa Valley Vintners
Assn. "That's probably why our office wasn't flooded with frantic calls
and e-mails. The berries are already off the vines."</TE>

<HD>Trauma-Care Funding Cuts Are Scrapped</HD>
<DH>Spending: Davis drops plan to slash $25 million from centers as the
state faces a huge budget shortfall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis is withdrawing his plan to cut $25 million from the
state's trauma-care centers, reflecting the political reality that, even
with a $12-billion budget deficit, there is little support for the
proposal among lawmakers.</LD>
<LD>   Hoping to make the most of the reversal, Davis plans to announce his
decision today at County-USC Medical Center, home to one of 44
trauma-care centers that will benefit from the state money. Los Angeles
County has 13 trauma-care centers, which in the last budget year treated
12,788 patients--the most of any county in the state.</LD>
<LD>   News of the Davis decision was greeted with relief by health care
advocates.</LD>
<TE>   "The $25 million is not the solution to the funding of our trauma-care
system in California, but it definitely was an important Band-Aid to help
us get through the next year while we figure out what the longer-term
solution will be," said Jan Emerson of the California Healthcare Assn., a
state association for hospitals.</TE>
<TE>Welcome News for Lawmakers</TE>
<TE>   Eliminating money for the trauma-care centers was among $2.24 billion
in budget cuts Davis proposed in November as part of his plan to close
the estimated $12-billion deficit. Lawmakers from both parties were
particularly critical of the trauma-care cut, and on Wednesday they
welcomed news of Davis' reversal.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm extremely happy and I think it was very smart," said Assembly
Speaker Bob Hertzberg, the Sherman Oaks Democrat who had carried
legislation that contained the $25 million in extra funding for
trauma-care centers. "When we're looking at making all these budget cuts
that could affect health care . . . we have to make sure not to remove
the safety net."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad the governor is reconsidering that particular spending
reduction," added Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho
Cucamonga.</TE>
<TE>   "The critical-care system is already on life support. It can't sustain
a reduction in funding. In fact, we should have been increasing the
funding significantly over the last few years," Brulte said.</TE>
<TE>Program Delays Are Still Planned</TE>
<TE>   Another Davis proposal that got a cool reception would delay until
July a much-heralded $200-million program to rescue the state's
lowest-performing schools, at a savings of $30 million to $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic lawmakers and advocates for the poor have also taken issue
with a Davis proposal to delay by nearly two years an expansion of the
Healthy Families program, which provides health coverage to poor
children. The delay is expected to save $210 million.</TE>
<TE>   There has been no indication that Davis plans to reverse himself on
those cuts. Also left on the chopping block is $5 million in seed money
for trauma-care planning activities.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's decision to reverse himself on the trauma-care funding
comes as he prepares to unveil his 2002-03 budget proposal next week. It
is expected to contain a slew of cuts and spending deferrals, in addition
to borrowing and refinancing proposals.</TE>
<TE>   In an unrelated development, state Treasurer Phil Angelides is
scheduled to outline a plan today to restructure the state's bond debt to
ease the budget deficit through 2004.</TE>
<TE>   A report prepared by Salomon Smith Barney suggests that the state
could save as much as $2.3 billion over the next two fiscal years by
taking advantage of low interest rates to refinance its general
obligation bonds.</TE>

<LD>Edward G. Jordan, 72, first chairman and chief executive of
Conrail, the federally assisted corporation created to salvage the
bankrupt Northeast rail freight system, died Dec. 26 at his vacation home
in Bend, Ore., of esophageal cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Known for his ability to turn around struggling corporations, Jordan
was appointed by President Gerald Ford in 1974 to head the U.S. Railway
Assn. and a year later was named head of Consolidated Rail Corp. He was
successful in solving the problems of the poorly run transportation
organization and resigned in 1980, after Conrail had two consecutive
profitable quarters.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Oakland, Jordan graduated from UC Berkeley and earned an
MBA at Stanford. He worked for several major corporations, including Ford
Motor Co. and Procter &amp; Gamble.</LD>
<TE>   After leaving Conrail, Jordan served as dean of the business school at
Cornell University and then president of American College in Bryn Mawr,
Pa., which instructs insurance professionals. He also served on the
California Transportation Commission in the late 1980s.</TE>

<HD>John Grigg, 77; Wrote Biography of Lloyd George</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>John Grigg, a writer who won praise for his biography of former
British Prime Minister David Lloyd George and stirred controversy with
his criticism of Queen Elizabeth II, died Monday. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   The Guardian newspaper, which published a column by Grigg for many
years, confirmed that he had died. No cause of death was given.</LD>
<LD>   Grigg's father was a private secretary to Lloyd George, who was prime
minister from 1916 to 1922. The son, a journalist, first took up Lloyd
George as a subject in "The Young Lloyd George," published in 1973.</LD>
<TE>   In 1978 and 1985, he published the next two volumes in the work, which
is widely considered the definitive biography of the crusading,
scandal-plagued premier, who led Britain through much of World War I.</TE>
<TE>   Grigg, born in London and educated at Oxford University, worked for
much of his life as a newspaper reporter, editor and columnist.</TE>
<TE>   A piece he wrote in 1957 for the monthly National and English Review
provoked outrage and damaged his hopes for a career as a Conservative
Party politician.</TE>
<TE>   In it, he criticized the monarchy as complacent and out of touch, said
Queen Elizabeth II should broaden her circle of advisors and complained
that she came across in public like "a priggish schoolgirl."</TE>
<TE>   In later articles he professed his support for the monarchy, but a
1977 piece on what he saw as the continuing narrowness of the queen's
circle--he singled out her court's lack of racial and ethnic
diversity--renewed the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Grigg inherited from his father the title 1st Baron Altrincham but
later renounced it.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote a column for the Guardian from 1960 to 1970, and for the
Times of London in the 1980s and early '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Grigg is survived by his wife, Patricia, and two sons.</TE>

<HD>Guido di Tella, 70; Argentine Official Helped Mend U.K. Ties</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Guido di Tella, 70, the Argentine foreign minister who helped mend
relations with Britain after the 1982 Falkland Islands war, died Monday
in a Buenos Aires hospital after suffering a stroke at his country home.</LD>
<LD>   Di Tella, also a former ambassador to the United States, was foreign
minister under then-President Carlos Menem in the 1990s, when Argentina
and Britain reconciled after the war over the Falklands, a British
possession off the Argentine coast.</LD>
<LD>   Di Tella's diplomacy was credited for the emotional 1998 visit that
Menem paid to Britain, the first by an Argentine leader after the war.
The 75-day Falklands war ended when the British drove Argentine forces
off the wind-swept archipelago in a decisive victory that left 750
Argentine and 220 British troops dead.</LD>
<TE>   Di Tella studied industrial engineering and received a doctorate in
economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In the 1970s,
he began an association with Argentina's Peronist Party, the country's
preeminent political force, and steadily rose through the ranks.</TE>

<KH>MIAMI REPORT</KH>
<HD>Coker Drops His Guard</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his last news conference before today's Rose Bowl national
championship game, Miami Coach Larry Coker dropped the aw-shucks
routine, if only for a minute.</LD>
<LD>   Since arriving in the Southland last week, Coker has tried to
deflect any praise given him.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, it's rather unusual to get your first head-coaching job at
the college level at age 53 and then find yourself on the verge of an
unbeaten season and a national title, Coker conceded. But, over and
over again, he stressed the credit should go to the players.</LD>
<TE>   Coker, who was Miami's offensive coordinator before being
promoted, was asked Wednesday if someone from the outside could have
achieved the same results.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably not," he said, his pride in this season finally kicking
in. "Not knowing our players, not knowing our system, it would have
been very, very difficult."</TE>
<TE>   When asked if his predecessor, Butch Davis, who left for the
Cleveland Browns, should get much of the credit for this team, Coker
again was candid.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety percent of these players," he said, "were recruited by
myself and other assistants who are still on the staff."</TE>
<TE>   But, added Coker, "Butch Davis was a tremendous draw and gave us
instant credibility. Nobody knew who I was."</TE>
<TE>   Aw shucks, he's probably right about that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although it has been assumed all week, Coker made it official.</TE>
<TE>   Strongside linebacker Chris Campbell, who developed an infection
in his right leg following surgery and has not practiced since the
team's arrival, will not play today.</TE>
<TE>   His place will be taken by Howard Clark.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Willis McGahee, a freshman who will start at fullback, is learning
to look forward rather than backward when he lines up in the
backfield.</TE>
<TE>   "I would get real upset when I would fumble or something," McGahee
said. "I would just keep thinking about that fumble, so I've had to
learn to just move on to the next play."</TE>
<TE>   McGahee moved up on the depth chart when Najeh Davenport broke his
left foot in a practice following the last regular-season game.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport, who has remained with the team, has been talking to
McGahee about his focus.</TE>
<TE>   Said Miami offensive coordinator Rob Chudzinski of McGahee: "He's
going to have to grow up quick."</TE>

<DH>Officials Warn: Arrive Early or Risk Missing Kickoff</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To those in the capacity crowd, security measures at the Rose Bowl
today will not be noticeably different from the customary precautions
at UCLA games since Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   However, federal and local authorities have stepped up their
preparation and the number of undercover law enforcement officers
will be greatly increased.</LD>
<LD>   The most frequent advice from officials is simply this: Arrive
several hours early.</LD>
<TE>   "We want this to be an enjoyable experience for all the fans, but
we will take whatever measures are necessary to make sure the bowl
championship is safe and secure," said Cmdr. Mary Schander of the
Pasadena Police Department, adding that there have been no threats or
reasons to believe spectators or players will be at risk.</TE>
<TE>   Among the precautions:</TE>
<TE>   * Dogs capable of detecting explosives will canvass the stadium
area before the game.</TE>
<TE>   * Owners of motor homes parked in tailgating areas will be asked
to report suspicious activity. Vehicles as well as individuals in
tailgating areas will be subject to search.</TE>
<TE>   * Spectators will be searched upon entering the stadium and will
not be allowed to bring backpacks, coolers, large handbags or
banners.</TE>
<TE>   * Counter-terrorism specialists and FBI agents will be among the
dozens of law enforcement officers working undercover. Cameras will
monitor events inside and outside the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   * The Federal Aviation Administration has declared the Rose Bowl a
"no-fly zone" during the game. A blimp and law enforcement
helicopters will be the only aircraft allowed over the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   * A large stockpile of medical supplies and decontamination
equipment are on hand.</TE>
<TE>   Amid all the precautions, the primary concern is with traffic
because the game is scheduled on a weekday at 5 p.m., the height of
the evening rush hour, and will be attended by thousands who have
never been to the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "People should allow time," Schander said. "Charter bus sales so
far are significantly less than for other big games here. So it
appears people will be driving cars to the game. We are encouraging
fans to carpool and to arrive early."</TE>
<TE>   Searches will be time-consuming and Schander said that anyone
rolling in even 90 minutes before the game might miss kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   "For the person who wants to enjoy the game, especially those who
are not from the area, we are encouraging them to come to Pasadena
for lunch, then take a shuttle to the Rose Bowl," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the time for out-of-town fans to be navigating the
freeways for the first time."</TE>

<HD>It's All Roses for Collins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thunder Collins was reared 10 blocks from USC, dreaming of one day
carrying the ball for the Trojans in the Rose Bowl. Collins will be
on the field at the Rose Bowl today, but he'll be running the ball
for Nebraska in the bowl championship series national championship
game against Miami.</LD>
<LD>   "It's funny how things work out," said Collins, a junior running
back who played at Manual Arts High and East Los Angeles College
before joining the Cornhuskers. "It's kind of hard to believe I'm
going to be playing in Pasadena for Nebraska."</LD>
<LD>   Collins, 6-feet-2 and 190 pounds, has rushed for 647 yards this
season, third among the Cornhuskers behind starting I-back Dahrran
Diedrick, who rushed for a Big 12 Conference-best 1,299 yards, and
quarterback Eric Crouch, the Heisman Trophy winner who rushed for
1,115. Collins also is third on the team in receptions with 19 for
189 yards.</LD>
<TE>   "Thunder's built more like a wide receiver rather than the typical
big pounding backs that maybe Nebraska has had, but he has developed
into a very tough player for us," Coach Frank Solich said.</TE>
<TE>   Collins pretty much had to become tough, growing up with Thunder
as his given name. Collins' father also is named Thunder.</TE>
<TE>   Since arriving in Los Angeles on Dec. 24, Nebraska has practiced
almost daily at USC's Howard Jones Field, the same place Collins
played pick-up games with friends in elementary school and junior
high.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State offered him a scholarship after he'd gained more
than 1,000 yards his senior year at Manual Arts, but he fell short of
a qualifying score on the SAT. Collins played at East L.A. College in
1998 and was named a junior college All-American after rushing for
1,548 yards, catching passes for 600 more, and scoring 23 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Gillespie, who coaches Nebraska's running backs, said the
Cornhuskers often steer clear of junior college players but that it
was difficult to ignore the tape of Collins coaches at East L.A. had
sent to Lincoln, Neb.</TE>
<TE>   Collins redshirted his sophomore year while completing work for an
associate arts degree at West L.A. College, then transferred to
Nebraska in 2000. Last season, he played in three games and gained 77
yards.</TE>
<TE>   Collins' 2001 season appeared in jeopardy when he was arrested in
Lincoln in June for allegedly assaulting a girlfriend and Nebraska
basketball player Shannon Howell. Charges against Collins were
dropped when he agreed to enter a pretrial diversion program. He
played in all 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska, which lost to Colorado in its regular-season finale,
62-36, has not lost consecutive games since the 1990 season, when the
Cornhuskers lost to Oklahoma, 45-10, then were defeated by Georgia
Tech in the 1991 Citrus Bowl, 45-21.</TE>

<HD>As Usual, Money the Key</HD>
<DH>College football: Bowl championship series will last
because participants get paid, and very well, to make it work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE HISERMAN and DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Call it unique. Call it archaic.</LD>
<LD>   College football will determine a national champion at the Rose
Bowl tonight in a manner unlike any other major-college
sport--without the benefit of a playoff.</LD>
<LD>   After years of debate, football still doesn't have a version of
basketball's March Madness tournament or baseball's College World
Series.</LD>
<TE>   What it has is a loose collection of bowls capped by the bowl
championship series, a complex and controversial means of choosing
two teams for a title game.</TE>
<TE>   This, you already knew.</TE>
<TE>   But you might not know why this distinctive system will stay in
place for the foreseeable future.</TE>
<TE>   Call it profitable.</TE>
<TE>   While fans may grumble, the current arrangement keeps television
happy and, as a result, keeps tens of millions of dollars circulating
among a select few conferences--six to be exact--that founded the
BCS.</TE>
<TE>   And the powers that be can find little reason for change.</TE>
<TE>   "What [is the] incentive?" asks an executive from a major
conference. "There is no incentive."</TE>
<TE>   Not when the rich get richer.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the bowl season tonight, 25 games will have paid out
almost $150 million to 50 teams--all but about $10 million of that to
schools from the BCS-founding Atlantic Coast, Big 12, Big East, Big
Ten, Pacific 10 and Southeastern conferences.</TE>
<TE>   And when it comes to the BCS games, the Big Six are guaranteed six
of the eight spots. This year, they have all eight.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl, matching undefeated and top-ranked Miami of the Big
East vs. once-routed Nebraska of the Big 12, is expected to top the
$35 million in revenue it generated last year, said Mitch Dorger,
chief executive officer for the Tournament of Roses.</TE>
<TE>   The money comes primarily from television, but also from
sponsorships and ticket sales. TV revenue has increased about $1.5
million and tickets, up $25 each from last year, are expected to
generate an additional $2.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Deducted from the Rose Bowl pot is a management fee--about $5
million last year--and other expenses, including beefed-up security.
The biggest expense: the $11.75 million paid to each of the teams.</TE>
<TE>   That money actually goes to the respective conferences, which
distribute the proceeds according to their own individual formula.
For example, Nebraska will receive about $2.3 million off the top to
cover its Rose Bowl expenses, with the remaining $9.45 million
divided equally among Big 12 teams.</TE>
<TE>   In the eight-team Big East, the top five finishers receive an
allotment based on their standing in conference play. The rest of the
money is split equally among all teams. Miami will take in more than
$4 million in Rose Bowl payout but must pay its own expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Dee, Miami's athletic director, estimated his school will
spend about $2.5 million to transport and house some 650 school
representatives--players, coaches, the school president and trustees,
band members and cheerleaders--to the game. The school also quickly
sold its allotment of 21,000 tickets and had to seek out an
additional 4,000 tickets.</TE>
<TE>   After expenses, Dee said he expects Miami to escape with about a
$900,000 profit. Not a windfall, but not chump change, either.
Especially considering the exposure the school will receive from
playing in a national championship game on prime time television,
with front-of-the-sports-page play in newspapers across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, money isn't the only reason to maintain the current
network of bowl games. While lower divisions of college football hold
playoffs, a similar arrangement involving the major schools might
create a several logistical headaches. Among them:</TE>
<TE>   * A 16-team playoff would involve only 15 games, 10 short of this
season's schedule of 25 bowl games. Some bowls might be discontinued,
and smaller ones that are saved might fight over where they fit in a
playoff structure. Also, bowls would lose their freedom to court a
local team, boosting ticket sales.</TE>
<TE>   * The season would have to be longer. Because the bowls are played
on just about every day of the week, they can be jammed into a short
period of time--from Dec. 18 through today. With a playoff, the
season would be extended about two more weeks. Fans would be forced
to scramble from week to week on travel arrangements, not knowing for
sure where their team is playing--or if it is playing.</TE>
<TE>   * A playoff system would lock games into weekends, forcing as many
as eight games into a Saturday, or spill over into direct competition
with the NFL for fans and prime television spots.</TE>
<TE>   * Promotional and sponsorship exposure currently tied into the
bowl games would have to be renegotiated. And many of those
opportunities might dry up altogether because, instead of the
traditional weeks-long build up to a bowl game, the hoopla might be
limited to a few days.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, fewer promotion and sponsorship windows means, all
together now ... less money.</TE>
<TE>   It's a vicious circle.</TE>
<TE>   Or, as Dee, the Miami athletic director, said, "There are so many
problems, so many unanswered questions" to a playoff format.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionalists also make a compelling argument for maintaining
the spirit of the postseason, which allows so many teams to finish
their seasons with a victory. There's a champion for every bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   And a winner in ABC.</TE>
<TE>   Last January, the network signed a four-year, $400-million
contract extension with the BCS through the 2006 bowl games. While
that pales in comparison to CBS's 11-year, $6-billion deal to carry
the NCAA men's basketball tournament--more money for the
major-college conferences--the arrangement left both sides happy.</TE>
<TE>   The conferences benefit from major network exposure and plenty of
money to spread among its athletic programs. ABC sells plenty of
advertising based on good ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what a lot of people are overlooking is how much this
system is an improvement over what we had in the past," said Loren
Matthews, senior vice president of programming for ABC Sports.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be a disagreement as to who is No. 1 and No. 2, but at
least now we theoretically have the top two teams playing for the
national championship."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, has a little controversy ever hurt the ratings?</TE>
<TE>   "Controversy works for TV," Matthews said. "As long as people are
talking about it, that's good for TV."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>To the nice but naive football players from Miami and Nebraska:</LD>
<LD>   Before taking part in this town's most revered sports event today,
there is somebody you should know about.</LD>
<LD>   His name was Lewis P. Bansbach.</LD>
<TE>   One hundred years ago, he shared your history.</TE>
<TE>   He was Stanford's quarterback. His team was playing Michigan. He
had suffered two badly sprained ankles in practice and couldn't play.</TE>
<TE>   But near the end of the game, his team being whipped, he could no
longer watch.</TE>
<TE>   He threw down his crutches and hobbled into the Stanford huddle.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do I have to sit here and watch that team running all over
us?" he shouted.</TE>
<TE>   The game was halted briefly while two teammates picked him up,
carried him off the field, and put him in a chair.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis P. Bansbach spent the rest of the game, a 49-0 Michigan
victory, weeping.</TE>
<TE>   That was our first Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   A century later, here's hoping you Hurricanes and Cornhuskers will
treat it with the same respect.</TE>
<TE>   Show us, Miami, that your well-scrubbed program can behave with
equal dignity under a tighter collar.</TE>
<TE>   Show us, Nebraska, that everything we said about you was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Give us a good game. Give us the effort of Washington &amp; Jefferson,
the inspiration of Rockne and Warner.</TE>
<TE>   Those are some other folks you should know about.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1922 Rose Bowl, tiny Washington &amp; Jefferson held mighty Cal
to a 0-0 tie, using the same 11 players the entire game.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, Knute Rockne's Notre Dame beat Pop Warner's
Stanford in a game featuring four guys who'd once posed for a
photograph on horseback.</TE>
<TE>   The sports world is under the impression that a national title is
at stake tonight.</TE>
<TE>   We know better.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl is more powerful than the BCS. It is more enduring
than any poll.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight is not just about a championship, but a tradition, another
chapter in a legacy as rich as a New Year's Day sunset over Linda
Vista.</TE>
<TE>   We're all going to miss that sunset this year. The New Year's Day
thing too.</TE>
<TE>   The organizers sold out the date and time to be part of something
bigger.</TE>
<TE>   But they surely now realize, around here there is nothing bigger.</TE>
<TE>   Has there ever been less local interest in the game? Anybody else
have tickets they can't get rid of?</TE>
<TE>   The thought of fighting rush-hour traffic instead of walking over
from the parade is daunting. The idea that this is not our Pacific 10
against their Big Ten is depressing.</TE>
<TE>   Do you know that this year's game breaks a streak of 55
consecutive Rose Bowl games between the two conferences?</TE>
<TE>   And that, during that time, the Big Ten won 28 games and the
Pac-10 won 27?</TE>
<TE>   We'll miss that. But it's not the fault of Miami or Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   And despite its age, here's guessing the Rose Bowl is still
flexible enough to accommodate these strangers, as long as they leave
the place as they found it.</TE>
<TE>   Show us, Miami, the strength of that amazing offensive line, the
wits of that flagpole-looking quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Show us, Nebraska, that Eric Crouch can break the real Heisman
jinx.</TE>
<TE>   Nine times, this event has featured the Heisman Trophy winner. But
only three times has he been voted player of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Archie Griffin of Ohio State came out here after both of his
Heisman wins and was jumped by the locals both times.</TE>
<TE>   Not that there's ever a wet eye in our houses about Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1973 game, then-Buckeye coach Woody Hayes tried to ruin the
finest day of arguably college football's finest team.</TE>
<TE>   USC finished a 12-0 season with a 42-17 Rose Bowl win that
featured four diving touchdowns by Sam "Bam" Cunningham.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, Hayes shoved a camera into the face of an L.A.
Times photographer, sending him to the doctor.</TE>
<TE>   During the game, Hayes stomped on his eyeglasses, sending them to
the trash can.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Hayes answered a reporter's question about his
behavior with, "Why, you dirty ... ... ... ."</TE>
<TE>   Bo Schembechler was plucked more here--eight times in 10
games--but Woody will forever hold the record for most thorns.</TE>
<TE>   It is, however, a wisp of a record.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl is generally not a controversial game, unless you
count the time in 1964, when Washington co-captain David Kopay was an
escort for the Rose Queen at the same</TE>
<TE>   time he was dating his fraternity</TE>
<TE>   brother.</TE>
<TE>   Heck, it hasn't even rained steadily on this game in nearly 50
years.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl was the first intersectional postseason game.</TE>
<TE>   The first bowl game to draw more than 100,000.</TE>
<TE>   The first nationally televised bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   And a lasting tribute to a guy named Roy Riegels.</TE>
<TE>   That's somebody else you should know about, Miami and Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe you think you already do.</TE>
<TE>   In 1929, Riegels was the California center who picked up a fumbled
Georgia Tech punt return and ran 64 yards the wrong way.</TE>
<TE>   He was finally stopped by teammates at the Cal one-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   His teammates were so upset, they punted the ball immediately.
Georgia Tech blocked the punt for a safety that led to its 8-7 win.</TE>
<TE>   The play is the most famous in Rose Bowl history.</TE>
<TE>   The photo of Riegels sitting on the goal line, holding his head in
despair, is the game's most compelling.</TE>
<TE>   He was so upset, he was removed for the rest of the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Those who still don't understand the Rose Bowl, though, should
understand what happened next.</TE>
<TE>   Riegels returned in the second half and played outstanding
football, even blocking a punt and recovering it.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward he offered no excuses, saying he had simply become mixed
up.</TE>
<TE>   And not once in 64 remaining years of a life lived under that
little black cloud did he hide, or flee, or change that story.</TE>
<TE>   With effort and honor, Roy Riegels' wrong way has become the Rose
Bowl's right way.</TE>
<TE>   When he was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame in 1991,
Riegels received a memorably loud standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Even through tonight's chilly darkness, perhaps Miami and Nebraska
can hear it.</TE>

<HD>Kings Get Big Lift in 3-1 Win</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Palffy and Schneider return as L.A. ends four-game winless
streak by defeating Florida.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Neither Ziggy Palffy nor Mathieu Schneider scored a goal but their
return from injuries certainly helped propel the Kings to a 3-1 victory
over the Florida Panthers on Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Allison had a goal and an assist, and Mikko Eloranta and Adam
Deadmarsh each scored for the Kings, who rode 29 saves from goaltender
Felix Potvin to end a four-game winless streak in front of 17,006 at
Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   In his first game back in the lineup after missing the last 14, Palffy
had an assist on Allison's first-period goal. Schneider didn't score a
point after sitting out the previous 23 games following hernia surgery on
Nov. 15.</LD>
<TE>   "Anytime that you are missing great players like that out of your
lineup, it definitely hurts," Allison said. "We're a much better team
with them in the lineup. They mean a lot to us. We're going to win a lot
of games with them playing.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I've been here, we really haven't been healthy at all. Ziggy,
Adam [Deadmarsh] and myself haven't played too many games together. And
Schneid's been out too. That's going to hurt a team. I think good things
are going to start happening for us now that they are back."</TE>
<TE>   With his team scheduled to begin a five-game trip Saturday, which will
take the Kings from New York to San Jose over eight days, Coach Andy
Murray would have loved to get off to a fast start.</TE>
<TE>   But the up-and-down Kings did just the opposite.</TE>
<TE>   Florida had seven of the game's first eight shots on goal and
dominated play early. After killing off the Kings' first power-play
opportunity, the Panthers took a 1-0 lead when rookie Kristian Huselius
scored his 15th goal of the season 15 minutes 48 seconds into the first
period.</TE>
<TE>   Huselius, one of the top first-year players in the league, was able to
score, thanks to great efforts from teammates Bill Lindsay and Kevyn
Adams, who helped keep the puck deep in the Kings' zone.</TE>
<TE>   After falling behind by a goal, the Kings' play picked up with Palffy
and Allison leading the way. Los Angeles tied the score at 1-1 with two
minutes remaining in the period when Allison scored his ninth goal of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   With Huselius doing his best to stop him, Allison finished the play by
carrying the puck from behind the net to in front of Florida goaltender
Roberto Luongo, where he missed a shot before knocking in his own rebound
before falling face-first on the ice.</TE>
<TE>   As if they just used the opening 20 minutes as a warm-up, the Kings
had a lot more life in the second period. Eloranta got things going when
he ripped through a check from Florida defenseman Bret Hedican against
the right wall at the blue line and then outhustled center Viktor Kozlov
for a rebound goal four minutes into the period.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of resting after Eloranta's third goal of the season gave them
a 2-1 lead, the Kings maintained their attack.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the period, they kept the puck in the Florida zone, and if
not for some great saves by Luongo, the Panthers would have found
themselves down by several goals.</TE>
<TE>   Luongo ended up making 20 saves in the period to keep the Panthers in
the game at the second intermission. It was the most shots on goal in a
period this season for the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   In the third, the Kings were finally able to add an insurance score
when Deadmarsh took the team lead in goals with his 14th 8:53 into the
period. Deadmarsh's score was the Kings' 36th power-play goal of the
season, which is third in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   "We played a pretty solid game defensively tonight," Murray said. "It
was one of those games where Felix just had to be good and he didn't have
to be great. That's what you want for your goaltender."</TE>
<TE>   For Palffy, it was just good to be on the ice again.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting back on my game is a big thing," said Palffy, who had 16:50
of playing time against the Panthers. "They played a physical game and I
was fine.... The key was that we played so well defensively and we stuck
together."</TE>
<TE>   The bad news for the Kings--who were 7-4-4 for 18 points in December,
which tied their second-most points ever scored in the month--is that
Andreas Lilja and Eloranta suffered knee injuries and had to leave the
game. They will be examined today, according to Murray.</TE>

<LD>No team goes from frantic, desperate, out-of-its-mind in trouble to
cool quite like the Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   No player goes from heave-up-a-shot absurd to pound-his-chest fearless
quite like Kobe Bryant. Eventually, it starts to make sense.</LD>
<LD>   Seeking to come out of the absence of Shaquille O'Neal with something
approaching aplomb, the Lakers defeated the Denver Nuggets, 87-86,
Wednesday night at Pepsi Center. Bryant hit the big, late, fade-away jump
shot as the 24-second clock died and the Nuggets failed to score in the
final two minutes 31 seconds.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers are 3-2 without their all-planet center, and have some
expectation for his return from the agony of two sore toes on Friday
night against the Phoenix Suns. They are 22-6 overall, despite the recent
injuries to O'Neal and Bryant, in part because of games just like
Wednesday's, in part because they are a point better even when they don't
play very well at all.</TE>
<TE>   And still, Bryant shook his head, grinned crooked, and wondered about
the fuss.</TE>
<TE>   "It don't think it really matters, because we aren't going to play
without Shaquille in the playoffs," he said. "It doesn't matter, because
our team is \o7 with Shaquille\f7 . We're going to win a championship \o7
with Shaquille\f7 . That's the bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   So, they go from mundane to tears rolling out of the corners of their
eyes in about three minutes, and Bryant wouldn't stop shooting until they
won, and Rick Fox made the defensive play of the game, and it was all
enough. And Nick Van Exel just dropped his head, in disgust. And Mitch
Richmond just shook his, in amazement. And Mark Madsen rushed from the
bench and grabbed Bryant from behind in a bear hug, because that's how
tense it got, and how jubilant they were, even trying to be cool about
it.</TE>
<TE>   "He can overcome anything," Richmond said of Bryant, who scored 22 of
his 28 points in the second half. "That's how he plays. It is rare, but
it's having that thing, that hating-to-lose thing, the feeling like you
can get out of anything."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers scored only 14 points in the fourth quarter, but they
scored the last five. Bryant had two shots blocked in the last 95
seconds, but made three field goals in the last three minutes.</TE>
<TE>   It was enough, partly, because it was against the Nuggets. But it was
enough, too, because that's what they needed, and the Lakers can be quite
adept at playing a point better than absolutely necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "We were lucky," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   There was that, too.</TE>
<TE>   The Nuggets scored their last points on an eight-foot runner by Van
Exel, who, along with fellow guards Avery Johnson and Voshon Lenard
nearly beat the Lakers by themselves. Avery scored nine points in the
fourth quarter, most on pick-and-rolls that rubbed off Derek Fisher or
Lindsey Hunter. Van Exel had 25 points and Lenard had 22.</TE>
<TE>   Van Exel's shot gave the Nuggets an 86-82 lead with 2:31 remaining.
The Lakers would need five.</TE>
<TE>   So Bryant went to the low post and scored on a six-foot fadeaway in
the lane to come within 86-84, and then Fisher drew a charge in the lane
on the other end against Van Exel.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant missed a jumper, gathered the rebound, and fed Samaki Walker,
who missed the dunk but was fouled and made one free throw. The Lakers
were within 86-85.</TE>
<TE>   Van Exel then missed an 18-footer, a terrible shot, leading to one
last offensive possession for the Lakers. Bryant had a short jumper
blocked by Calbert Cheaney, chased the loose ball, ripped it away from
Fisher and, with the shot clock approaching zero, made a 20-footer from
the left wing. The Lakers led, 87-86, and Bryant returned up the floor
banging his right fist on his chest.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, man, what can I say, man?" Bryant said. "Shot clock was low, I
just went and got it. All I see is the ball and the basket."</TE>
<TE>   Once he realized whose hands were on the other half of the basketball,
Fisher let go.</TE>
<TE>   "He always gives it a chance," Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   The Nuggets' final possession lasted nearly 30 seconds. They missed
twice, and had the ball but failed to get one last shot when Fox stuck
out his hand and tied up a penetrating Van Exel. While Van Exel won the
jump ball, time expired before the Nuggets could get another.</TE>
<TE>   "It's crazy, it's intense," Bryant said of the final half-minute. "We
started fighting. We started fighting for every ball. We played a scrappy
ballgame and that's why we won."</TE>
<TE>   In perhaps his season's best all-around game, Fox had 17 points, seven
rebounds and six assists. Walker had 11 rebounds and 14 points. The
Lakers made just 39% of their attempts, but had enough, barely.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, I think we're going to be dreaming about pick-and-rolls," Hunter
said. "So many pick-and-rolls, setting all those crazy screens. But, good
teams win like that, and force things to happen their way. It's fun when
it turns out your way."</TE>

<HD>Florida Is Well-Armed in Victory</HD>
<DH>Orange Bowl: Gator quarterbacks Berlin and Grossman combine for 456
yards passing and five touchdowns in 56-23 rout of Maryland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI
</DL>
<LD>If Steve Spurrier figured he had room against Maryland to tinker
with his quarterbacks--well, he was right.</LD>
<LD>   The Florida coach benched Heisman Trophy runner-up Rex Grossman at the
outset of the Orange Bowl for missing curfew five days before the game,
and held him out until 6:03 remained in the first half.</LD>
<LD>   That final score: No. 5 Florida 56, No. 6 Maryland 23.</LD>
<TE>   Grossman came in with a 14-10 lead and turned the game into a blowout
in front of 73,640 at Pro Player Stadium, finishing with 248 yards
passing and four touchdown passes.</TE>
<TE>   Against a Maryland defense that was no match for the Gators'
speed--especially their track team of receivers--Florida set Orange Bowl
records with 659 yards of total offense and 456 passing yards.</TE>
<TE>   A bit of intrigue remains.</TE>
<TE>   Benching Grossman allowed Spurrier to give fellow sophomore Brock
Berlin his first start, precisely at the moment Berlin is weighing
transferring to Miami. (The Hurricanes, by the way, are on the Gator
schedule beginning next season in a renewal of the series.)</TE>
<TE>   Berlin was good and bad, completing 11 of 19 passes for 196 yards and
leading Florida to two touchdowns, but he also had two passes
intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   As for his future: It's undecided.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm actually going to wait a few days, be with my family," Berlin
said. "I haven't made up my mind. We'll just wait and see.</TE>
<TE>   "Rex came in and did an excellent job. He's done a great job all
year."</TE>
<TE>   As Berlin played deep into the second quarter, Grossman stood on the
sideline, his helmet on, waiting.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pacing up and down, to tell you the truth," said Grossman,
unsure if he'd play at all.</TE>
<TE>   When Spurrier finally sent Grossman in--one possession after Berlin's
second interception--Florida's lead was still four because Maryland
failed to capitalize fully on the turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   That lead would grow. Quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Grossman missed a receiver deep on the first play, then completed six
of eight passes for 61 yards on a drive that ended with a 15-yard pass to
Taylor Jacobs in the back of the end zone. (Jacobs finished with 10
receptions for 170 yards and two touchdowns.)</TE>
<TE>   Florida's lead was 21-10.</TE>
<TE>   The Gators got the ball back with 1:24 left in the half.</TE>
<TE>   Plenty of time.</TE>
<TE>   Florida went 64 yards in six plays and Grossman found Jabar Gaffney in
the end zone with a four-yard pass--with three seconds remaining in the
half.</TE>
<TE>   After two possessions, he had completed 11 of 14 passes for 125 yards
and two touchdowns, and Florida led, 28-10.</TE>
<TE>   Grossman completed 20 of 28 passes in the game and led Florida to
touchdowns on six consecutive possessions after entering the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he might have a little more experience," Maryland Coach Ralph
Friedgen said. "I think the other kid has a real good arm and a real good
release. I think Grossman sees better, and his timing is a little
better."</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier, who has been accused of playing mind games with quarterbacks
before--Grossman isn't the first Heisman contender he has benched--had
only praise afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "Rex gave us a nice lift. Brock was struggling a little bit. I just
felt it was time Rex got into the game. Rex was really sharp. He might
have had his best game of the year."</TE>
<TE>   The Gators (10-2) had one of their better ones too.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got some great athletes," said Friedgen, whose team finished
10-2 in his first season as coach.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in the NFL for five years, and the only team that was better
was the Oakland Raiders. They've got great team speed and an overall
great unit. Our offense tried to hang in and battle the whole way, but
they just have more players."</TE>
<TE>   Florida had the services of running back Earnest Graham, who missed
the Gators' loss to Tennessee because of a sprained knee.</TE>
<TE>   He ran for 149 yards and two touchdowns in 16 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs was one of two 100-yard receivers for Florida. Gaffney had 118
and two touchdowns on seven catches.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland couldn't keep up, and Florida could only lament losses to
Auburn and Tennessee that took the Gators out of the national
championship hunt as well as the Southeastern Conference title.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't win much this year," Spurrier said. "We did win the Orange
Bowl and go 10-2 and finish in the top five of the country. We'd still
rather be ordering rings."</TE>
<TE>   They can look to next year, perhaps.</TE>
<TE>   Grossman said he is recruiting teammates not to leave for the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   As for Berlin: "I hope he stays," Grossman said. "He's a great
quarterback. It's just too bad we're in the same class. If something were
to happen to me, our team would be better off if he's here. But we
shouldn't be greedy."</TE>
<TE>   Grossman knows this: Sometimes you have to wait your turn.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have any extra motivation or bitterness," he said. "I just
tried to win the game."</TE>

<HD>First Road Test Not Passed</HD>
<DH>Clippers: A 105-91 loss at Sacramento is start of a stretch of 21
of 30 games away from Staples.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>The road to respectability begins on the road for the Clippers.</LD>
<LD>   No matter what they do in the friendly confines of Staples Center, the
Clippers must win at least a few games while putting up with overpriced
room service, questionable officiating and hostile crowds.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, if we're going to be taken seriously as a playoff
[contending] team, we've got to win some road games," Coach Alvin Gentry
said before the Clippers lost for the eighth time in nine games away from
Staples.</LD>
<TE>   Certainly, there's no crime in losing to the Sacramento Kings, as the
Clippers did Wednesday by 105-91 in front of 17,317 at Arco Arena. After
all, better, more accomplished teams have fallen like a brick against the
Kings at Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   It's simply the wrenching transition from a polished, confident team
at home to a harried, uncertain club on the road that's so puzzling.
Whether it's inexperience or immaturity, the Clippers become easy prey
once they leave the 213 area code.</TE>
<TE>   If the Clippers hope to solve their bone-jarring woes along the NBA's
bumpy road, they must do it soon. Wednesday's game was the first in an
unkind stretch that has them away from Staples for 21 of 30.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take a minute," Elton Brand said. "I think our road
woes are going to be eradicated soon. It's a good test to see if we're
going to be a good team or not."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday, the answer was not.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, the NBA's best team at home with an 18-1 record, played a
huge role in the Clippers' demise. Six Kings scored 10 or more points,
led by Chris Webber's 21 (to go with 10 rebounds and six assists).</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento seized control in the final minutes before halftime, going
on a 12-5 run and taking a 56-47 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most remarkable halftime statistic was this one: the Kings
had only one turnover, a franchise record. They would finish with seven,
one shy of a club record. The Clippers had 17, leading to 20 points for
the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   When the Clippers got close late, the Kings powered away swiftly and
certainly. Sacramento led by 81-72 after Brand's layup with 10:21
remaining, but the Kings didn't blink.</TE>
<TE>   Webber made two steals to set up electrifying sequences at the other
end of the court. Bobby Jackson made a driving layup after the first and
then set up Webber with a lob pass on the second, which gave the Kings a
96-77 lead with 6:08 left.</TE>
<TE>   "We missed a lot of layups and other shots that we usually make," said
Clipper forward Lamar Odom, who scored 13 points in his first game after
being sidelined for three because of a sprained right wrist.</TE>
<TE>   Odom fared about as well as could be expected, making five of eight
shots and taking seven rebounds and adding four assists. He was termed
questionable for the game by the team Tuesday, but warmed up with his
teammates Wednesday and gave it a go.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't had many games on the road," said Odom. "We need to learn
how it's going to be. We're so used to playing at Staples, but there are
some different bounces off the rims on the road."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Olowokandi, who did not play in Tuesday's 112-97 victory over
Portland at Staples because of food poisoning, was back in the starting
lineup and that gave the Clippers a familiar look when they took the
floor to face the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "If he's healthy, I'm going to play him," Gentry said of Odom, whose
wrist was taped. "He thought he could go, so we played him, what, 40
minutes?"</TE>
<TE>   That's good news as the Clippers' two-game trip continues Friday
against the Nuggets at Denver. They're back at Staples to face the
Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday, then it's off on a six-game trip to the
East.</TE>

<LD>Dan LeBatard of the Miami Herald, on Florida football Coach Steve
Spurrier: "The scoreboard is truth. That's why [he] likes it so much,
because of the way it puts winners and losers in their place.</LD>
<LD>   "[He] can be very small about some things, but he's very big on truth,
often to his detriment, so over the years that scoreboard has become his
greatest ally and friend, validating him, and his methods....</LD>
<LD>   "Nobody believes in Spurrier as much as Spurrier does, and that's why
he is the most relentlessly interesting person on college football's big
stage, even as he spends the collision-filled 60 minutes standing off to
the side of it."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Spurrier: "How can you ever get in trouble being too honest?" he
said. "They accuse me of a lot of things, but they can't ever accuse me
of lying. What's the popular term now? Politically correct? It would be
easier to be politically correct. But I'd rather be right than
politically right."</TE>

<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the record for rebounds in a regular-season NBA

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Something to quack about: Bernie Lincicome of the Rocky Mountain News
on Oregon's convincing 38-16 victory against Colorado in the Fiesta Bowl
and the Ducks' claim to the national championship:</TE>
<TE>   "It was never a football game as much as a thumb in the eye of the
bowl championship series. The Fiesta Bowl had to be, for one team or the
other, confirmation that college football is run by idiots, or computers,
which is just as dangerous....</TE>
<TE>   "It was one big game too far for Colorado and one big game just enough
for Oregon, now entitled to petition consideration as the best college
football team in the land."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ripping Rasheed: Ken Rudolph of Fox Sports Net's "Best Damn Sports
Show Period" had this zinger last month:</TE>
<TE>   "At a ceremony at Staples Center in Los Angeles, prior to the
Lakers-Clippers game, Kobe Bryant was commissioned as an honorary
ambassador to the city of Kobe, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "No word yet as to whether the city of Moron, Cuba, will be extending
the same honor to Rasheed Wallace."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Zzz: Hank Wesch in the San Diego Union-Tribune: "Commenting on the
winds of change that have swept over the Big Ten men's basketball
coaching fraternity over the last seven years, leaving only Purdue's Gene
Keady from the old guard, Michigan State's Tom Izzo says: 'The [coaches']
meetings aren't as good anymore. The only one left is Gene, and we have
to revive him half the time."'</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Calmer time: When asked what's new entering the 2002 golf season,
David Duval said, "Nobody is suing me."</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Titleist sued Duval for breach of contract and he filed a

<TE>   And finally: Bill Walton commenting to the Denver Post on former
Nugget coach Dan Issel's ethnic slur to a fan after a game in December:</TE>
<TE>   "As a former player, I know that coaches and players alike are trained

<TE>   Publisher: Hamilton Hills</TE>
<TE>   Price: $14.95</TE>
<TE>   Bill Leach, 55, was an All-American in water polo and swimming at UC
Irvine and later became an Olympic kayaker and world-class triathlete.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Newland, 74, coached Leach in water polo at Newport Harbor High,
Corona del Mar High and UC Irvine. He has coached at Irvine for 36 years
and is the winningest water polo coach in NCAA history with 663
victories. His team has won six NCAA championships in Division I and
three in Division II.</TE>
<TE>   Leach and many others who were on Newland's teams credit his
philosophies and teachings for the successes they've enjoyed in life.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, Leach convinced Newland that they should write a book about
the coach's philosophies. It was basically a "how to" book. It sat on the
shelf for more than 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   They finally recruited a professional writer and editor, Lesley
Bindloss, came up with a better format and have now reached the finish
line.</TE>
<TE>   This soft-cover book consists of 45 personal reflections by the men on
their athletic careers. The segments are well-written and easy to read.
Some are amusing, all are enlightening. The book is also filled with
enlightening quotes from a variety of people.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, there's this from Laker great Jerry West: "Confidence is
a lot of this game, or any other. If you don't think you can, you won't."</TE>
<TE>   This quote is at the start of a segment by Leach, from a water polo
opponent on what he perceived as a superior team: "Until you believe you
can beat us, you never will."</TE>
<TE>   It was one of those lessons in life. There are many of them in the
book. One of Newland's segments is about how he persuaded his 10-year-old
to compete in a sailing race despite his fear of the gusty winds on that
particular day.</TE>
<TE>   The book can be ordered through http://www.circleofsuccess.net or by

<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm rooting for Nebraska today.</LD>
<LD>   To be honest, the feelings were probably there for the Cornhuskers all
along, you know, like Richard Gere picking up Julia Roberts in "Pretty
Woman"--Gere a little crude and misguided in his initial overture to
Roberts but coming to his senses in time to express his true love.</LD>
<LD>   So I kind of think of myself as Richard Gere here, and while it's
probably a stretch to link a pretty woman with Nebraska in any
way--certainly shape--or form, I have to admit, I've flipped for
Nebraska.</LD>
<TE>   I'm an American, after all, and Americans love calamity, chaos and
controversy, and with Oregon's smashing victory over Colorado, we have
the makings of a wonderful disaster. Take Titanic, for example. Everyone
knew the boat was going to sink, and yet it did big-time box office
business like almost no other movie because it promised calamity, chaos
and ended in controversy.</TE>
<TE>   To this day my wife insists Kate Winslett was speaking from the heart
when she said, "I'll never let you go," and then promptly let go of
Leonardo DiCaprio's hand so he'd drop to the bottom of the ocean. I say
she already had the expensive necklace in her coat pocket and had no
intention of making it a two-way split.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it's passionate disagreements like this that keep a
marriage fresh. I remember offering to take my wife on a cruise and then
climb the railing at the front of the ship and hold her high over the
water just like Leonardo and Kate--if she agreed to lose just a few
pounds, and you should have seen how that fired her up.</TE>
<TE>   AT SOME point I expect my wife will begin talking to me again, and a
win by Nebraska could be the icebreaker (that's a little Leonardo humor).
A Nebraska win entitles every sports fan to have an opinion of who should
be the national champion. The coaches, obligated to declare Nebraska
champs, will probably be in direct conflict with the writers, who figure
to declare Oregon No. 1 in the Associated Press poll.</TE>
<TE>   Since it's pretty widely accepted that sportswriters know everything,
that favors Oregon's claim as the legitimate winner.</TE>
<TE>   A Miami win ends the college season without dispute, and with The
Times sending 12 writers and Bill Dwyre to the game, I can't imagine
anyone reading all those stories without at least a hint of controversy
to make them compelling. I can't imagine anyone reading Dwyre, but I'm
not about to tell the sports editor that.</TE>
<TE>   Two days ago no one liked the Huskers--even though Nebraska gave us
our first TV dinner in 1953, which means Nebraska is responsible for
feeding me dinner more than anyone else I know. (She's already not
talking to me, so what do I care?)</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska also gave us Cliff Notes, which is appropriate, because it
appeared the Cornhuskers were taking a short cut to winning the title.
That upset a lot of people, but now after Oregon's win, everyone is
rooting for an upset and chaos.</TE>
<TE>   That means most of us will have to rally around Lil' Red, and while I
thought that was the Huskers' nickname for quarterback Eric Crouch, who
bears a strong resemblance to Tom Thumb, I'm told now Lil' Red is
Nebraska's mascot.</TE>
<TE>   I'm also told the Cornhuskers have a lovely Spirit Squad--comprising
I'd imagine young ladies recruited from out of state, who will lead us in
cheers.</TE>
<TE>   As for the University of Nebraska fight song--"No Place Like
Nebraska"--which would explain why President Clinton visited 49 states
before going to Nebraska, I'd ask you to sing along with me now:</TE>
<TE>   \o7 "There is no place like Nebraska, dear old Nebraska U</TE>
<TE>   Where the girls are the fairest, the boys are the squarest ... ."</TE>
<TE>\f7</TE>
<TE>   "WHERE THE girls are fairest?" Woo Pig Sooie ... oops, wrong school.
Anyway, it's going to be crucial for everyone to pull together to bring
this season to a chaotic conclusion. Miami is really good, and the other
day I ran into a few of their players at a news conference, and you have
to wonder about college players wearing more jewelry than Georgia
Frontiere collected from her seven husbands.</TE>
<TE>   Wide receiver Daryl Jones was wearing his Miami jersey and football
pants, along with a diamond chain around his neck attached to a
diamond-crusted cross, a diamond-studded school ring, wedding ring,
bracelet, watch, and diamond earrings.</TE>
<TE>   "The diamond cross was a gift," Jones said, and too bad UCLA's DeShaun
Foster didn't think to call the loaner Ford Expedition a gift. "My wife
got me the bracelet on our cruise." I went on my first cruise when I was
47 years old.</TE>
<TE>   Miami cornerback Phillip Buchanon and running back Clinton Portis were
wearing so many diamonds you have to wonder if Miami awards a jewel to
everyone for a good play like some schools award helmet decals. I can
only imagine what their girlfriends are wearing.</TE>
<TE>   The guys from Miami obviously don't need puny little championship
rings, which bodes well for our Huskers, who can win them and then spend
the rest of their lives sitting around the pot-bellied stove explaining
how they swiped them from the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Roy:</TE>
<TE>  \o7  "I work near a hotel where Nebraska fans are staying. Herds of
Nebraska females with nasty looking cattle prods are roaming the streets
inquiring about your whereabouts."</TE>
<TE>\f7    What's the mystery? I'm at every Kings game.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Miami Coach Perry Clark had a different reason for getting little
sleep New Year's Eve.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not saying the streak is getting to me, but the other night I had
a dream that we lost," Clark said. "I got up and I wouldn't go back to
sleep. I can tell you everything that came on late night. They had an
oldies show on UPN or something. I was not going back to sleep."</LD>
<LD>   Clark's nightmare didn't come to life Wednesday night. His No. 21
Hurricanes tied a school record with their 14th consecutive victory,
79-71 over No. 24 Georgetown, in a Big East Conference opener at
Washington.</LD>
<TE>   The Hurricanes (14-0), who had a 14-game winning streak in 1947, can
break the school record Saturday at Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   'We're not looking at what we've done; we're looking at what's ahead
of us," Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   James Jones led Miami with 22 points</TE>
<TE>   Georgetown tied the score five times after trailing by as many as 14
points but was never able to take the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Sweetney scored 25 points to lead the Hoyas (9-4), who have lost
three in a row, all to ranked teams.</TE>
<TE>   Georgetown's Courtland Freeman scored on a tip-in that made it 68-68
with 3:48 to play. Elton Tyler made two free throws and Marcus Barnes
followed with a three-point basket to put Miami ahead by five and the
Hurricanes secured the victory by going six of eight from the line over
the final two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 Duke 106, Davidson 71--Carlos Boozer had 23 points and 13
rebounds at Charlotte, N.C., as the Blue Devils extended their winning
streak to 22 games.</TE>
<TE>   Duke (12-0) played much of the game without Mike Dunleavy, who
suffered an ankle injury with eight minutes remaining in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Dunleavy fell to the floor holding his left ankle after colliding with
a Davidson player while going for a rebound. He sat briefly on the bench
as trainers removed tape around his ankle, then limped toward the locker
room two minutes later and never returned.</TE>

<HD>Barnes Goes to Great Lengths to Improve</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forward Matt Barnes has added an unexpected dimension to his game,
making eight of 18 three-point attempts this season, including three
Saturday against Georgetown.</LD>
<LD>   Unexpected to everyone but his teammates, who watched the 6-foot-7
senior sink hundreds of long jump shots during summer workouts.</LD>
<LD>   Barnes made only three of 25 from three-point range last season and
five of 32 in 1999-2000.</LD>
<TE>   "I've always been able to do it, but I needed to be able to do it in
the games," he said. "I shot all day, every day, during the summer."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Steve Lavin doesn't mind Barnes launching from behind the arc,
as long as he does so within the flow of the offense.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to become a one-pass, jack-the-long-three team, but
when he's open Matt can make the shot," Lavin said. "When teams sag on
[center Dan Gadzuric] with two defenders, that can leave Matt open. And
if he hits the shot, they have to adjust."</TE>
<TE>   That was the case against Georgetown, when Barnes made two
three-pointers in the first few minutes and the Bruins built a 20-point
first-half lead en route to a 98-91 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Cedric Bozeman is expected to play eight to 10 minutes Friday against
Washington, his first playing time since having knee surgery Dec. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Although UCLA is 7-0 without the freshman point guard, Lavin is
anxious to get him back on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "He had good practices [Tuesday and Wednesday] and I'm very encouraged
by his play," Lavin said. "He's very sharp."</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman, who started the first four games, will come off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very anxious, practice is going good and I'm trying to fit in
with these fellows," Bozeman said. "I'm in good condition and I'm ready
to test my knee."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Fey, the freshman center from Olympia, Wash., who has
struggled to gain eligibility, expects to receive his ACT score this
weekend in a last-ditch effort to join the team before the winter quarter
begins Monday</TE>
<TE>   Fey took the ACT and SAT in November. He did not receive a qualifying
score in the SAT, and the testing service has yet to comply with his
request to have the test scored by hand.</TE>

<KH>USC REPORT</KH>
<HD>Bibby Grows Angry Over Grievance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC Coach Henry Bibby has yet to hear from the Pacific 10
Conference on his grievance of last week, when two Trojans were hit in
the head by seemingly the same errant elbow late in their victory at
Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Bibby is upset with the non-response.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm sure if it was a bigger-name coach, then something would have
been done right away, but I haven't heard one thing back," he said
Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   "And I'm disappointed in the league that they haven't called us back
or [Pac-10 coordinator of men's basketball officiating] Lou Campanelli to
review the film. That should have been done immediately."</TE>
<TE>   Campanelli could not be reached for comment, but Pac-10 spokesman Dave
Hirsch said the league had asked USC for a tape of the alleged incident
and had not received it yet.</TE>
<TE>   After the tape arrives, Hirsch said, Campanelli and Commissioner Tom
Hansen will view it.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 27, Washington freshman forward Jeffrey Day was fighting his
way through a double pick when his elbow allegedly connected with USC
freshman guard Errick Craven's right eye and the top of sophomore forward
Jerry Dupree's head.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg Guenther Jr., a reserve tight end on the USC football team, has
joined the basketball team</TE>
<TE>   Guenther, a 6-foot-8, 250-pounder, averaged 16 points and 12 rebounds
at Woodland Hills Taft High as a senior in 1999-2000 and was recruited to
play basketball by Pepperdine and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a physical presence that we don't have," Bibby said of Guenther.</TE>
<TE>   "He brings a football-toughness that we don't have. He brings us a lot
of energy. Where he fits in, I don't know yet. He's way behind in the
things we're doing.... It's just a matter of how quickly he picks things
up."</TE>
<TE>   Senior point guard Brandon Granville has sat out the last two days of
practice because of a sore left foot. USC plays Washington State at the
Forum on Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully Brandon's going to be ready," Bibby said. "But if not, then
we go with [junior Robert Hutchinson] and we go with [freshman] Derrick
Craven [Errick's twin brother]."</TE>

<HD>Loyola Finally Gets Moving</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Occidental, a late addition to the Loyola Marymount men's
basketball schedule, was simply supposed to keep the Lions sharp as they
prepare for West Coast Conference play.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the Division III Tigers put up a fight.</LD>
<LD>   It lasted about 12 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   Loyola Marymount eventually wore them down and recorded an 81-55
victory in front of an announced 1,478 Wednesday night at Gersten
Pavilion. Forward Keith Kincade and reserve Sherman Gay each had 14
points for the Lions.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't a complete reversal from Sunday's lackluster loss at
Montana, but it was an improvement. Loyola Marymount (7-6) got scoring
from all 12 of its players and held Occidental (8-1) to 37% shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "I was happy that we were able to play a good team," Loyola Coach
Steve Aggers said. "They were 8-0 and a very well-coached and disciplined
team that runs their stuff. That does better for our team than to play a
non-Division I team that isn't like that."</TE>
<TE>   Song Cun made Occidental's third three-pointer in the first six
minutes for a 14-11 lead. Dan Murphy's 15-foot jumper gave them a 19-16
lead, prompting Aggers to call timeout.</TE>
<TE>   Usually calm and unflappable, Aggers was visibly animated in the
huddle.</TE>
<TE>   Aggers said the eight-day break before the Montana game hurt his team.</TE>
<TE>   "We kind of lost our competitive edge," he said. "I've been pushing
them pretty hard trying to get back our intensity level and energy level
back to where we need to have it as we head towards conference play."</TE>
<TE>   Loyola turned up its defensive pressure and held Occidental to only
one field goal in an eight-minute span.</TE>

<LD>   Cal State Fullerton (3-8, 0-2) at UC Irvine (8-4, 1-0), 7 p.m.,
KUCI-FM (88.9)--As Irvine tries to extend its 16-game home winning
streak, the Anteaters must avoid looking past the Titans tonight and
Riverside on Saturday with a showdown at Utah State looming next week.
Guard Jerry Green is on pace to become Irvine's all-time leading scorer.
He needs 157 points to pass Tod Murphy and scored 50 in Oneida Classic
tournament victories over Lipscomb and Boston U. Fullerton lost its two
Big West games by a total of three points and is coming off a road loss
to Northern Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   UC Riverside (4-6, 1-1) at Long Beach State (4-8, 0-1), 7 p.m., KPRO
(1570)--Coach Wayne Morgan is hoping a 35-point blowout of Indiana Purdue
Fort Wayne jump-started his 49ers for the next three games, Big West
contests against Riverside, Cal State Fullerton and Idaho. Sophomore
forward Kevin Roberts' emergence as a reliable scorer is helping ease the
loss of swingman Lemi Williams, sidelined for the season by a knee
injury. Riverside is also feeling good after routing Sacramento State.</LD>

<HD>Ducks Are Left With Foul Taste</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Anaheim has its gripes with the officials after a 5-3 loss
to the Red Wings. A rally from a 4-0 deficit does little to satisfy
players.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT
</DL>
<LD>Everyone on the Mighty Ducks had an instant opinion when Detroit's
Mathieu Dandenault scored a power-play goal that finally wrapped up a 5-3
victory with 1:33 left Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Bryan Murray folded his arms in disgust. Goalie Jean-Sebastien
Giguere flipped the puck back up ice in frustration. Defenseman Keith
Carney slammed his stick in anger.</LD>
<LD>   So close to rallying from a 4-0 deficit against the best team in the
NHL, only to let it get away.</LD>
<TE>   Or have it taken away, which was the group opinion in the Duck
dressing room.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks felt they lost a goal with eight minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Martell ruled he should have blown the whistle before Dan Bylsma
poked the puck from under goalie Dominik Hasek's pad.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks thought they lost a chance.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Friesen was called for a roughing penalty when he shoved
Detroit's Kirk Maltby after Maltby had cross-checked Friesen in the back
of the head with 2:37 left.</TE>
<TE>   So instead of cruising out of the Motor City with a moment to savor,
the Ducks had one--or two--to gripe about.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a call you get in Detroit," Friesen said. "You play Detroit
and everyone wants them to get the most points in history, so you know
you're going to be down calls. But that late in the game, just let it
play out.</TE>
<TE>   "He cross-checks me and that could have been called. It was stupid to
retaliate, but it's not like I wound up and drilled him. So ... "</TE>
<TE>   So Dandenault scored to send what was left of the 20,058 in Joe Louis
Arena home relieved.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Red Wings' fourth power-play goal of the game, against a
Duck team that had killed 30 of its last 31 penalties.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings scored three in the first period, jumping out as if they
were teaching the Ducks a lesson. But late in the third period, the Ducks
were pretty much wiping their feet on the Red Wings.</TE>
<TE>   Samuel Pahlsson scored short-handed in the second period. Oleg
Tverdovsky danced around Luc Robitaille and fired a shot past Hasek.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought in the first period we just stood around," Murray said. "We
were trying to play a 1-2-2, but it was like five pylons.</TE>
<TE>   "The first part of the game was embarrassing how we played. Then we
got some speed into the game."</TE>
<TE>   Then Martell took the air out of it.</TE>
<TE>   Hasek made two slick saves, then tried to cover the puck with his
right leg pad.</TE>
<TE>   Bylsma poked at it. The puck slid into the net. The goal light
flashed. And Martell frantically waved his arms.</TE>
<TE>   "[Referee] Dave Jackson said the puck went in, but [Martell] was
thinking of blowing the whistle, therefore it's as good as if it was
blown," Murray said. "I guess that's true. I heard that once before in 20
years. To disallow a goal, I wonder."</TE>
<TE>   Team captain Paul Kariya got a longer version.</TE>
<TE>   "He said you can't push the guy's pad and puck in," Kariya said.
"Regardless of whether it went in or not, that was the question."</TE>
<TE>   Which left Bylsma perplexed.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously that's what he gets paid to do, make a judgment call
there," he said. "We were celebrating because we didn't hear a whistle.
The puck was on his pad. I jabbed at the puck.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought until the whistle, you had a right to go after the puck."</TE>
<TE>   Even Detroit Coach Scotty Bowman complained.</TE>
<TE>   "The puck was frozen actually," Bowman said. "He should have blown
before."</TE>
<TE>   All of which became important five minutes later when Marc Chouinard
knocked in a rebound that would have tied the score, but instead made it
4-3.</TE>
<TE>   "The explanation to me that he was thinking of blowing the whistle,
therefore he declared the whistle blown," Murray said. "That's a good
explanation, but I don't buy it.</TE>
<TE>   "I shake my head at half the calls. But I [complain] about
everything."</TE>
<TE>   And he did.</TE>
<TE>   Tverdovsky was sent off for holding Kris Draper three minutes into the
game.</TE>
<TE>   Five seconds into the power play, Robitaille casually flipped in a
rebound for the first of his two points.</TE>

<LD>It was a short night of work for Mighty Duck goalie Steve Shields
in a 5-3 loss to the Detroit Red Wings on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Shields was pulled 3 minutes 19 seconds into the second period after
the Ducks fell behind, 4-0. He saw 13 shots, four of which went in.</LD>
<LD>   It ended a string of solid games by Duck goalies, who had allowed only
28 goals in 16 games. But it was hard to blame Shields because the Red
Wings scored on all three of their first-period power plays.</LD>
<TE>   "You don't want to embarrass your goaltender, you want to get him
out," Coach Bryan Murray said. "We certainly didn't help very much early
on. They had wide-open chances to score goals. I didn't think it was fair
to ask to battle beyond what he did."</TE>
<TE>   Shields, though, didn't blame himself or his teammates. He felt that
there were other factors involved.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole night was filled with bad calls [by the referees]," Shields
said. "I think when a team takes a good penalty, it finds a way to kill
it off. It's the ones where guys are stepping on your sticks and [the
referees] call tripping. You get a few of those, it kind of gets to the
squad. Those are the ones you get scored on."</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Sebastien Giguere finished up and stopped 14 of 15 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Shields had allowed only 12 goals in his previous five starts.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't play our game in first period," Shields said. "We should be
a lot more confident going into another team's rink. We may not score a
lot of goals, but we can sure as heck play defense as good as anybody in
the league. That's something we should thrive on every game."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks outshot Detroit, 15-6, in the third period. But the Wings,
who nearly blew a 4-0 lead, have had their problems closing games. They
have allowed eight third-period goals, plus an overtime goal, in the last
four games, including two by the Ducks on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Former King Luc Robitaille's first-period goal was the 609th of his
career, moving him within one of hall of famer Bobby Hull.</TE>
<TE>   "That's pretty special because he was a great player," Robitaille
said. "To be named with him is certainly something pretty unique. When I
tie him, it will be special."</TE>
<TE>   Robitaille has 19 goals and 28 points this season.</TE>

<LD>The Boston Bruins weren't slowed down by Ron Francis or any of the
Carolina Hurricanes.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Guerin scored two goals, Glen Murray had one in the first 12
minutes, and the Bruins used a four-goal first period to defeat the
Hurricanes, 6-3, Wednesday night at Raleigh, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   One bright spot for the Hurricanes came in the first period, when Ron
Francis scored his 500th career goal. The Carolina captain joined Wayne
Gretzky, Gordie Howe, Mark Messier and Marcel Dionne as the other players
in the 500-goal, 1,000-assist club.</LD>
<TE>   "You hope it comes in a victory, but it didn't," Francis said. "It's
still a very special milestone and a club I'm very proud to be a part
of."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins have won six of seven to move into first place in the
Eastern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Guerin completed his second career hat trick by scoring into an empty
net with 42.1 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 2, Atlanta 1--Mike Modano scored a power-play goal at Dallas,
becoming the fourth U.S.-born player to score 400 goals.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Nieuwendyk's power-play goal with 9:08 remaining was the
game-winner.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta, which got a goal from Tony Hrkac, is 2-10-3 in its last 15
games.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 2, Tampa Bay 0--Dwayne Roloson turned away 36 shots to lift
the Wild at St. Paul, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   Marian Gaborik scored his team-leading 16th goal, helping the Wild end
a three-game skid.</TE>
<TE>   Darby Hendrickson scored the other goal.</TE>
<TE>   The Lightning lost their fourth in a row despite outshooting the Wild,
36-20.</TE>
<TE>   Roloson, who recorded his third shutout this season and fifth of his
career, was 0-4-1 in five December starts, giving up at least three goals
in each game.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 5, Philadelphia 2--Gary Suter's 200th career goal was the

<TE>   Owen Nolan had a goal and two assists, and Adam Graves, Scott Thornton

<DL>EDMONTON, Canada
</DL>
<LD>It was a difficult day all around for the New York Rangers.</LD>
<LD>   Sean Brown had the first two-goal game of his career and the Edmonton
Oilers, boosted by Ryan Smyth's surprise return from injury, defeated the
Rangers, 4-1, Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   While the Oilers celebrated Smyth's return, the Rangers played without
Eric Lindros, who was put on injured reserve by the club after being
examined by a neurologist.</LD>
<TE>   Lindros, who suffered the seventh concussion of his career at San Jose
on Friday, won't be eligible to return until Saturday at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   "I will just keep riding the bike and if things go well I will get my
skates on as soon as possible and get back out there," Lindros said.
"Things are going along pretty well."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, a stay-at-home defenseman, also had 11 penalty minutes in the
game, including five for fighting Matthew Barnaby in the first period.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Smith and Anson Carter added third-period insurance goals for
the Oilers, who are 3-1-1 in their last five.</TE>
<TE>   Radek Dvorak scored for the Rangers, who have lost two in a row after
a three-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Smyth returned after sitting out 21 games with a fractured right
ankle.</TE>
<TE>   The team had said nothing about his return before pregame
introductions.</TE>
<TE>   He was hurt on Nov. 16 and was expected to be out up to 12 weeks.
Instead, he was back after seven.</TE>

<HD>Red Sox Sale Faces Scrutiny</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Massachusetts Attorney General Thomas Reilly said Wednesday major
league baseball "played a major role" in deciding the winning bidder for
the Boston Red Sox, calling into question the fairness of the sale
process.</LD>
<LD>   Reilly is investigating the sale of the team after the Red Sox
rejected the highest bid in favor of a $660-million offer from a group
headed by Florida Marlin owner John Henry, who is close to Commissioner
Bud Selig. Lawyer Miles Prentice headed a group that offered $750 million
for the team.</LD>
<LD>   "Major league baseball was calling the shots here," Reilly said after
a four-hour meeting with Red Sox Chief Executive Officer John Harrington
and team lawyers.</LD>
<TE>   Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief legal counsel, denied the accusation.</TE>
<TE>   The Jean R. Yawkey Trust owns a majority stake in the team. Reilly,
whose office oversees charities and charitable trusts, said he is
obligated to ensure that the charities receive the maximum benefit from
the sale.</TE>
<TE>   The charities stand to gain more than $400 million from the deal.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox have said that Prentice's bid was unacceptable because he
had not secured financing.</TE>
<TE>   Players resume their grievance today to ensure the Minnesota Twins and
Montreal Expos play this year.</TE>
<TE>   Arbitrator Shyam Das, who presided over five days of testimony last
month, will resume the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides have tentatively agreed to start working next week on a
collective bargaining agreement to replace the one that expired Nov. 7.
Owners voted Nov. 6 to fold two franchises.</TE>
<TE>   The union claims the decision violated terms of the expired collective
bargaining agreement, which remains in force.</TE>
<TE>   Left-handed reliever Mike Holtz signed a $1.8-million, two-year
contract with the Oakland Athletics. He was 1-2 with a 4.86 earned-run
average and no saves with the Angels last season....Reliever Mike
Williams signed a $7-million, two-year deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates.
He began last season with the Pirates and was traded to Houston in
July....Detroit Tiger right-hander Brian Moehler, who sat out most of
last season because of shoulder problems, signed a $2.4-million, one-year
contract with the club....Free-agent infielder Chris Stynes and the
Chicago Cubs agreed to a $1.25-million, one-year contract....Matt
Walbeck, the Angels' catcher in 1998-99, agreed to a minor league
contract with the San Diego Padres.</TE>

<KH>KING REPORT</KH>
<HD>Norstrom's Job Is to Stop Forward Progress</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Captain Mattias Norstrom does plenty of things for the Kings, but
one area he doesn't help the team much in is scoring.</LD>
<LD>   That's because Norstrom, who entered Wednesday night's game against
Florida with only one point in 36 games, knows what his main job is, and
that's shutting down top offensive forwards every night.</LD>
<LD>   "In going against the top players, the way I look at it is that you
have to be able to skate with the guys first," Norstrom said. "You have
to always be physical with them but with most of the top players, skating
is their strength. Look at the Kariyas, the Modanos and Sakics, they are
outstanding skaters. Before you can hit them, you have to catch them.
That's my approach. Never to be standing still."</LD>
<TE>   Last season, Norstrom led the Kings in hits with 246, which was 12th
in the league, and had a plus-10 plus/minus rating. This season, however,
Norstrom trails teammate Ian Laperriere in hits and had a minus-8 rating
before Wednesday's game.</TE>
<TE>   In order for Norstrom to be effective, he has to be able to play
physical hockey, which has been a challenge this season due to several
nagging injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you can make any contact, then it really doesn't matter to me,"
Norstrom said. "But the challenge is to stay between them and our net. To
make them go through me before they can hit the net."</TE>
<TE>   With forward Ziggy Palffy and defenseman Mathieu Schneider returning
off injured reserve, Coach Andy Murray moved Andreas Lilja from
defenseman to right wing on the fourth line.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pete Sampras started the 2002 tennis season the same way he
finished 2001--on the losing side.</LD>
<LD>   Unseeded Todd Martin upset the second-seeded Sampras, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4,
in the first round of the Australian Men's Hardcourt Championships on
Wednesday at Adelaide.</LD>
<LD>   Sampras, a former world No. 1 who failed to win a tournament in 2001,
accepted a wild card for the event as a tuneup for the Australian Open,
which begins Jan. 14 at Melbourne.</LD>
<TE>   "It wasn't the start I was looking for," Sampras said. "It's not a
major setback. Setback is a pretty strong word, it's just more not ideal.</TE>
<TE>   "I have just got to start over, get back to the drawing board and
hopefully gain some confidence next week."</TE>
<TE>   Martin said Sampras' confidence has slipped.</TE>
<TE>   "Since he's not winning as many matches and not playing as many
matches because he's not winning, his confidence has waned," Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   "He is not hitting certain shots with the same amount of authority.
He's not taking some of the same chances that he took in years past."</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Tim Henman of Britain advanced when Kenneth Carlsen of
Denmark retired because of a shoulder injury. Henman won the first set,
7-6 (2).</TE>
<TE>   Mark Philippoussis, returning after a six-month layoff because of knee
surgery, defeated Julien Boutter of France, 6-3, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Venus Williams defeated Switzerland's Patty Schnyder, 6-0,
6-4, on a sweltering day in the Australian Women's Hardcourt
Championships at Gold Coast.</TE>
<TE>   "I really couldn't believe the shots I was making," Williams said. "I
haven't played since the U.S. Open in September and I surprised myself."</TE>
<TE>   Williams plays eighth-seeded Ai Sugiyama of Japan in the quarterfinals
today.</TE>
<TE>   Officials had to delay some matches when temperatures reached 104
degrees on center court at the Royal Pines Resort.</TE>
<TE>   Fifth-seeded Silvia Farina-Elia eliminated South Korean qualifier Cho
Yoon-jeong, 7-6 (5) 4-6, 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   Francesa Schiavone and David Sanguinette beat their favored American
opponents to spark Italy to a 2-1 victory in a round-robin match of the
Hopman Cup at Perth, Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Schiavone upset Monica Seles, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, and Sanguinette defeated
Jan Michael Gambill, 7-6 (1), 6-3. Seles and Gambill won the mixed
doubles, 6-1, 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   Australia's Lleyton Hewitt, the world's No. 1-ranked player, ignored a
high fever to win his singles match and later combined with Alicia Molik
to beat Argentina. After his second match, Hewitt broke out in spots and
later underwent tests to determine whether he had chicken pox.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Pierce beat Barbara Schett, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3), in the Hong Kong
Ladies Challenge, her first competitive match in more than seven months.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce was sidelined because of injuries for much of last year.</TE>
<TE>   Anna Kournikova advanced to the semifinals of the ASB Bank Classic
with a 2-6, 6-4, 7-5 victory over Switzerland's Emmanuelle Gagliardi
today at Auckland, New Zealand.</TE>
<TE>   Radek Stepanek, a qualifier from the Czech Republic, upset
second-seeded Goran Ivanisevic, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, in the second round of
the Qatar Open at Doha.</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov defeated Nikolay Davydenko, 6-7, (4-7),
6-4, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Calatrava saved two match points in the second set and rallied to
upset sixth-seeded Dominik Hrabaty, 2-6, 7-5, 6-2, in the second round of
the TATA Open at Madras, India.</TE>

<TE>   U.S. national team captain Claudio Reyna will be sidelined for up to
six weeks after bruising his left ankle Tuesday in Sunderland's 1-1 tie

<TE>   Reyna, who moved to Sunderland from Scotland's Glasgow Rangers last

</DL>
<LD>The World Cup finally has an English-language TV home in the United
States--ESPN and ABC.</LD>
<LD>   The Walt Disney Co. networks will air the games from the May 31-June
30 tournament in South Korea and Japan under a broad deal with Major
League Soccer announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Most games will start between 11:30 p.m. and 4:30 a.m. Pacific time.
The final will be June 30 at 4 a.m.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike in 1998, though, ESPN and ABC won't be paying upward of $20
million for the broadcast rights to the world's most-watched sporting
event. Instead, the networks are turning over time slots to MLS, which
will sell ads and cover production costs.</TE>
<TE>   The package, which reportedly cost MLS $40 million to $50 million,
includes the 2006 World Cup in Germany, the 2003 Women's World Cup in
China, and five seasons of MLS games through 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 2002 World Cup's 64 games, 17 will be shown live on ESPN, 46
live on ESPN2 and the final live on ABC, which will show eight other

<HD>Woods Has Plans for Quick Start</HD>
<DH>Golf: PGA Tour begins another season with the winners' only
Mercedes Championships in Kapalua, Hawaii.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KAPALUA, Hawaii
</DL>
<LD>Tiger Woods arrived with only the bottom half of his goatee
remaining, changed into golf shoes and was quickly out of sight.</LD>
<LD>   Carts are allowed for the practice rounds at the Mercedes
Championships, and about 50 fans had no chance of keeping up with him on
the hilly Plantation Course at Kapalua. Taking a shortcut on the back
nine and playing only six holes, Woods finished in 40 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps that kind of pace will set the tone for a new season.</LD>
<TE>   "It's always important to win early," Woods said. "It's important to
play well because it makes you feel better about the season."</TE>
<TE>   It also eliminates foolish talk about a slump, which is what Woods had
to endure last year until winning his first tournament at Bay Hill in
March.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Woods was coming off one of the greatest years in sports,
winning nine PGA Tour events and three consecutive majors. The question
was whether that would become a typical season or an exceptional one.</TE>
<TE>   It looks now to be an exception, although that could change.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would be very difficult to accomplish that again," British
Open champion David Duval said. "But I think he's capable of it."</TE>
<TE>   Added Shigeki Maruyama: "He still plays in another world."</TE>
<TE>   It all starts today along the rugged coastline of west Maui, where 32
PGA Tour winners gather for the season-opening Mercedes Championships.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Open champion Retief Goosen came halfway around the world from
South Africa, meaning all four major champions are in the field. The only
two winners who didn't show were Phil Mickelson, who wants to spend time
with his family, and Jose Coceres, who broke his arm playing soccer a
couple of weeks ago in Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   As for the young, emerging stars who are supposed to be challenging
Woods, only two are here--Sergio Garcia and David Gossett, the former
U.S. Amateur champion who won the John Deere Classic.</TE>
<TE>   And while the gap on Woods appears to have closed, he is still the guy
to beat. He had a year that would define careers for most everyone else
at Kapalua.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess he stunk, didn't he? Maybe he should think about other career
opportunities," Duval said mockingly about a season in which Woods won
five tour events, including a historic Masters that made him the only
player to hold all four major titles at the same time.</TE>
<TE>PGA TOUR</TE>
<TE>   What:   The 50-event PGA Tour opens today.</TE>
<TE>   First up:   The Mercedes Championships in Kapalua, Hawaii, a 72-hole
event running today through Sunday. The event will be televised on ESPN
(today, 5-7:30 p.m., Friday and Saturday, 4:30-7:30 p.m., and Sunday,
1:30-4:30 p.m.) and ESPN2 (Sunday, 8-11 a.m.)</TE>
<TE>   Local stops: The tour schedule includes four events in Southern
California--Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, Jan. 16-20 at La Quinta; Buick
Invitational, Feb. 7-10, at Torrey Pines, San Diego; Nissan Open, Feb.
14-17, at Riviera; and WGC-Accenture Match Play Championships at La
Costa.</TE>

<HD>Phaenna Raises the Stakes Again</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: The mare, a 13-1 longshot, holds off Song Of Summer
in stretch of the Survive Stakes and pushes earnings to $413,439.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What has been a bargain buy for owners Curt and Lila Lanning and
trainer Ed Moger Jr. got even better Wednesday at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Phaenna, purchased for $3,500, earned her 10th victory in 27 starts
and pushed her earnings to $413,439 with a front-running, 13-1 upset in
the $112,600 Survive Stakes.</LD>
<LD>   A daughter of Frankly Perfect, who was bred in California by Jerry
Buss, the 7-year-old mare defeated 3-1 second choice Song Of Summer by
31/2 lengths in 1:031/5 for the 51/2 furlongs.</LD>
<TE>   Making her first start since finishing fourth in the Pio Pico Stakes
at Fairplex Park on Sept. 14, Phaenna won for the third time in five
tries at Santa Anita and improved considerably on her effort in last
year's Survive. On New Year's Day, 2001, she was fifth in a field of
eight.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Victor Espinoza, Phaenna toyed with overmatched longshot
Secret Dream through the first quarter mile, then started to inch away.</TE>
<TE>   Last after a quarter of a mile, Song Of Summer, who was looking for
her second consecutive victory, rallied for the place, 21/2 lengths ahead
of 22-1 outsider Song Of The Moment.</TE>
<TE>   The disappointment in the Survive was even-money favorite Jeweled
Pirate. Well positioned by jockey Chris McCarron after breaking from the
rail, she had nothing in the stretch and wound up seventh in the field of
nine.</TE>
<TE>   Moger said of Phaenna, "She had really been training well. I thought
she might be one work away, but she was ready to roll.</TE>
<TE>   "She's always been a good mare and she always tries hard. When she
does get beat, it's because she just wasn't good enough or she wasn't
quite right. We had given her some time off because she had an abscess on
her foot and it took a while for her to get over it."</TE>
<TE>   Gulfstream Park will begin its 90-day meet today, and the feature race
is the $100,000 Spectacular Bid Stakes, a six-furlong sprint and the
first prep on the road to the $1-million Florida Derby on March 16.</TE>
<TE>   The co-high weights at 120 pounds in the Spectacular Bid, named for
the horse who won the Florida Derby in 1979, are Handsome Hunk, who won
the Fort Spring Stakes in the fall at Keeneland, and recent Inaugural
Stakes winner Bog Hunter.</TE>
<TE>   Eight horses were entered Wednesday morning for Saturday's $200,000
San Pasqual Handicap, the first race leading to the $1-million Santa
Anita Handicap on March 2.</TE>
<TE>   Euchre, second to Momentum in last month's Native Diver Handicap at
Hollywood Park, is the 120-pound high weight and one of two entrants for
trainer Bobby Frankel. The other is Milwaukee Brew, making his first
start for Frankel. Euchre and Milwaukee Brew will race coupled since both
are owned by Frank Stronach.</TE>
<TE>   Also scheduled to go are Casey Griffin, Red Eye, Last Parade, Seinne,
Irisheyesareflying and Wooden Phone.</TE>

<LD>Oakland Raider defensive tackle Darrell Russell cleaned out his
locker Wednesday and began serving a one-year drug suspension after the
league turned down his appeal.</LD>
<LD>   Russell, who tested positive for the drug Ecstasy, won't be eligible
to play until Jan. 2, 2003, following Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's
decision on the appeal.</LD>
<LD>   The former USC standout, who was the Raiders' first-round pick in the
1997 draft, sat out the first four games this season for violating the
league's substance-abuse policy.</LD>
<TE>   "Darrell has a problem that is well documented," Raider Coach Jon
Gruden said. "This is devastating for a young guy at the top of his
profession to have to go through this. I hope he can come back and resume
his career."</TE>

quarterback against Kansas City in the regular-season finale Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   A victory by the Seahawks (8-7), plus a loss by the Baltimore Ravens

<TE>   Holmgren said starter Matt Hasselbeck's separated left shoulder hasn't
healed completely.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jet quarterback Vinny Testaverde said his remarks about the offense's
performance at the end of New York's 14-9 loss to Buffalo were
misconstrued.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the headlines that said I was blaming [offensive coordinator
Paul Hackett for what happened in the game and that really wasn't the
case," Testaverde said.</TE>
<TE>   "By no means is the relationship between coach Hackett and I any
different than it was before the game. We have always had a good working
relationship and it remains that."</TE>

<LD>Alpine Skiing: Daron Rahlves of Sugar Bowl was pleased with his
sixth-place finish at a tough downhill last weekend in Bormio, Italy.
"We're not totally on yet, but we're on our way," Rahlves said of the
men's speed team. "I really feel good about my skiing right now." Chad
Fleischer's 16th-place finish in that race was his best of the season....
The head of the Austrian Ski Federation said two-time Olympic champion
Hermann Maier must compete in a World Cup race within the next few weeks
to be considered for the Olympic team. Maier, seriously injured in a
motorcycle accident in August, returned to the slopes a few weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   Biathlon/Cross-Country: The U.S. biathlon team will be announced
today, after the four-day trials.... Nina Kemppel of Anchorage, Alaska,
the first U.S. woman to qualify for four Winter Games, clinched a
cross-country Olympic berth with a strong showing in the 5-kilometer
classic. She didn't let the suspense linger until the 5K freestyle
pursuit. "I wanted to do it early and make it decisive in the first
race," said Kemppel, who won the first race by 35 seconds and was third
in the pursuit. Justin Wadsworth of Bend, Ore., clinched a berth on the
men's team.</LD>
<TE>   Bobsled/Luge/Skeleton: The thrill hasn't gone for bobsled driver Brian
Shimer after qualifying for his fifth Olympic Games. "This is the most
rewarding Olympic team that I have made," said Shimer, who began his
streak in 1988.... Three-time Olympic luge champion Georg Hackl of
Germany said his father's recent death of a heart attack won't stop him
from competing at Salt Lake City. "By taking part in my fifth Olympics I
will fulfill one of my father's dreams," he said. His father, also named
Georg, died of a heart attack after watching him compete in Konigssee,
Germany.... Lincoln DeWitt of Park City, Utah, finished first and second
last weekend in the first two races of the Verizon Championship Series
skeleton competition at Utah Olympic Park. Lea Ann Parsley of Granville,
Ohio, also had a first and a second. The series resumes Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Curling: The U.S. men's team, skipped by Tim Somerville of Roseville,
Minn., will compete at the Eau Claire (Wis.) bonspiel starting Friday.
The tournament ends Sunday. Members of the U.S. women's team, which is
skipped by Kari Erickson of Bemidji, Minn., will practice at their
individual clubs before convening for a team practice next week at the
Exmoor Curling Club in Highland Park, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Figure Skating: The Canadian championships begin Monday, with Elvis
Stojko trying for his seventh national title. He has been practicing a
quadruple lutz, which no skater has landed cleanly in competition. Canada
can send two men's singles skaters to Salt Lake City. Stojko won the
silver medal at Lillehammer in 1994 and Nagano in 1998.... Alexander Abt
of Russia, who finished second in the Russian national championships,
trains at Lake Arrowhead.</TE>
<TE>   Freestyle Skiing: Nagano gold medalist Eric Bergoust and U.S. champion
Emily Cook won aerials events Monday at Deer Valley, Utah, to claim
Olympic berths.... Donna Weinbrecht, a five-time World Cup champion and
U.S. record holder with 46 moguls victories, is struggling to qualify for
her fourth Olympic team. She has three events left to make the team.
Jonny Moseley, the 1998 men's moguls gold medalist, also might not
qualify.</TE>
<TE>   Hockey: The San Jose Sharks' plan to allow forward Marco Sturm to miss
a game against Carolina Feb. 10 so he could play two preliminary-round
games for Germany at Salt Lake City was protested by an unidentified
Eastern Conference team. Shark General Manager Dean Lombardi said the
protesting team claimed Carolina would have an unfair advantage that
would affect the playoff race. As a result, Sturm will play against
Carolina and will play only once for Germany, Feb. 9.... The U.S. women's
team will start a three-game series against Canada on Saturday in
Chicago. They will also play Sunday at Detroit and next Tuesday in
Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   Nordic Combined/Ski Jumping: Sven Hannawald of Germany has won two
events of the Four Hills ski jumping tournament. The last two legs will
be in Innsbruck and Bishofshofen, Austria, on Friday and Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding: The third of five Olympic qualifying events will be
staged today at Mt. Bachelor, Ore. The selection process takes into
accounts the results of World Cup, Continental Cup and Grand Prix
events....Snowboarder Chris Klug, who received a liver transplant in

Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   Speedskating: Gianni Romme of the Netherlands, the world-record holder
and 1998 Nagano gold medalist in the 5,000 and 10,000, barely made his
country's Olympic team after struggling at the national championships. He
finished third in the 10,000 and won a berth, but was fifth in the 5,000
and won't defend that title.... The world junior short track
championships begin Saturday at Seoul.</TE>

<LD>John-Andrew Kambanis and John Livaditis won't be pictured on cereal
boxes before the Olympics. No TV network has asked them to appear in
commercials to promote the Games. No pot of gold awaits them at the end
of the bobsled track at Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   As the driver and brakemen, respectively, for the Greek two-man
bobsled team, they have little hope of winning a medal. The two
Chicagoans, sons of Greek-born parents, are perhaps two seconds slower
than the top combinations. In a sport measured in thousandths of a
second, that gap might as well be two hours.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, their Olympic reveries are as vivid as those of any world
champion, and their motives refreshingly pure. They're authorized to
compete for Greece but get no financial support from the country and
figure they'll have to work two years to pay off their credit card debt.
They don't mind.</LD>
<TE>   "Greece started the Olympics, and there's a tremendous amount of pride
for us in being able to compete for Greece," said Kambanis, who took a
year's leave of absence from his job as a financial analyst to train for
the Games</TE>
<TE>   . "And in Europe, bobsled is a very prestigious sport. What you call
the power teams, the Swiss, Germans, French and Italians, all won medals
at the last Games. I think it's important for Greece to be participating.</TE>
<TE>   "A big part of it is the pride of participating and pride in our
heritage. The further you are from your native country, the more you want
to hold onto your traditions."</TE>
<TE>   Kambanis, who ran track at Chicago's Loyola University, got into the
sport by chance in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "My coach got a letter saying Greece was looking to put together a
bobsled team, and being the only Greek on the team, he passed it to me,"
Kambanis said.</TE>
<TE>   "I had never thought about it, but I decided, having grown up and
always dreamed of going to the Olympics, it would be a unique opportunity
and I should make a call and find out more."</TE>
<TE>   Greek-Americans inspired by the unlikely story of the Jamaican bobsled
team at the 1988 Calgary Games helped get the team up and running.
Kambanis was an alternate on Greece's inaugural bobsled team in 1994,
"and just the taste of it fueled me enough to go for it again in '98."</TE>
<TE>   With Kambanis as the brakeman, the Greek sled finished 30th among 39
teams at Nagano.</TE>
<TE>   "But we accomplished our goal of finishing first among the new teams
in the sport," Kambanis said. Afterward, he switched to the pilot's seat,
attending driving schools in Calgary and Austria. He also bought his old
teammate's interest in their sled and two years ago recruited Livaditis,
a former college lacrosse player.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year was the first full season we competed together," Kambanis
said. "That helped us put together a lot of things and trust each other."</TE>
<TE>   Hooking up with a knowledgeable coach also helped. They hired Patrick
Brown, who'd competed in the U.S. program before coaching the 1988
Jamaican team. When they found him, he was giving tourists rides down the
Olympic track.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just thrilled to have him as a coach," Kambanis said. "Last
year, when we were in Salt Lake City and couldn't afford to have a coach,
we paid him to coach us before a race, knowing he had a lot of experience
on the track.... This season it's more expensive, but it's money well
spent."</TE>
<TE>   Their expenses run about $80,000 a year. Kambanis and Livaditis
couldn't afford $3,000 to ship their sled to Europe for World Cup races,
so they competed only in North America and qualified for the Games on
Dec. 10. They raised money by selling T-shirts at a Greek festival in
Salt Lake City and set up a nonprofit fund and a Web site, \o7
www.olympicdream.net. \f7 Sending a photo and a donation of $20 will get
your picture in a collage on their sled.</TE>
<TE>   "My savings have all gone," Kambanis said, "but 20 years from now,
I'll be looking back and saying it was well worth it."</TE>
<TE>Thanks, Coach</TE>
<TE>   Becoming a coach has given former pairs figure skater Jill Watson a
new respect for the sport.</TE>
<TE>   "It's made me really appreciate the coaches that I had," said Watson,
who won three U.S. championships and the 1988 Olympic bronze medal with
Peter Oppegard. "It's not just the on-the-ice work of coaching. It's the
detailed, organizational work. As the director of a team of coaches,
because you have other coaches assisting you, there's a lot of
responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "For example, I set up exhibitions, I do travel plans and arrange for
designers and music. I enjoy it because it's such a developmental process
and I'm very involved with my teams and spend a lot of time with them on
the technical side."</TE>
<TE>   Watson, who lives in Laguna Niguel, coached in Irvine for two years
and moved to the Ice Palace in Aliso Viejo when the Irvine rink closed.
John Nicks, one of Watson and Oppegard's coaches, also works at Aliso
Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   Watson will guide two pairs at next week's U.S. championships at
Staples Center and the Sports Arena: Rena Inoue and John Baldwin in the
senior competition, and Jacqueline Matson and Johnnie Bevan in the junior
event. She engineered both matchups, putting singles skaters Bevan and
Matson together in April and former singles skater Baldwin with Inoue,
who had represented Japan in singles and pairs. Both duos are scheduled
to perform in an exhibition at the Ice Palace today at 1 p.m. Admission
is free, but donations will be accepted for skaters' training expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. senior pairs field is weak after the top-ranked duo of Kyoko
Ina and John Zimmerman, giving Watson hope that Inoue and Baldwin could
do well next week. Novice events begin Sunday at the Sports Arena, junior
events start Monday at Staples and senior competition begins Tuesday at
Staples.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some openings at the top of senior pairs," Watson said.
"They've trained very hard all year long and made a lot of improvement.
Last year they had quite a few injuries and they were trying to acquire a
lot of technical moves. My goal is for them to do a clean short [program]
and we'll see where they are."</TE>
<TE>L.A. Meet Still Running</TE>
<TE>   Middle distance runner Bernard Lagat of Kenya is expected to compete
in the Los Angeles Invitational indoor track meet Feb. 23 at the Sports
Arena. Lagat won the bronze in the 1,500 at the Sydney Olympics and was
second to Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco at last year's World
Championships.</TE>
<TE>   The Invitational will go on for the 42nd time, despite a lack of major
sponsorship and the discontinuation of a $20,000 grant it had received
each of the last four years from the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los
Angeles. Father-son meet promoters Al and Don Franken protested the AAF's
decision, but to no avail.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, there's no indication they're going to change their
mind, so we're moving on," Don Franken said. "We've been getting a few
sponsors here and there. It's actually better than last year."</TE>
<TE>Here and There</TE>
<TE>   Preparations for the U.S. Figure Skating championships began after
Wednesday's King game at Staples Center. Crews moved in to shave down the
ice, paint it light blue for TV, stencil in new logos and build it back
up to 11/2 inches. It was then covered for Friday's Laker game and
Saturday's Clipper game. The ice-level temperature will be 24-26 degrees,
compared to 21-22 degrees for hockey.</TE>
<TE>   "That allows the skaters to do their jumps and dig in and not chip up
the ice," said Lee Zeidman, senior vice president of operations for
Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Three people who lost relatives in the Sept. 11 tragedies will join an
assortment of celebrities, Olympians and Olympic hopefuls as torchbearers
when the Olympic flame arrives in Southern California Jan. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Among the winter sports athletes scheduled to run a leg of the relay
here are figure skaters Michelle Kwan, Sasha Cohen, Angela Nikodinov and
Tim Goebel, and speedskater Maria Garcia. The list of other Olympic
athletes features gold medal decathlete Bruce Jenner, 1968 200-meter gold
medalist Tommie Smith, water polo player Chuck Bittick, sailor J.J.
Isler, swimmer John Naber, pole vaulter Bob Seagren, and soccer player
Cobi Jones. Where and when they will run has not been set.</TE>
<TE>   Zachary Stone, Nicholas Mayer and Sheila Ornedo, who lost relatives on
Sept. 11, will take turns with the torch. Among the celebrities scheduled
to run two-tenths of a mile are TV host Larry King, activist Erin
Brockovich, producer Lauren Shuler Donner and director Richard Donner.</TE>
<TE>   Russian gymnast Maria Zasypkina, who broke her neck six weeks ago and
was temporarily paralyzed, left a Moscow hospital last week. She
underwent two operations and is expected to soon walk on her own.</TE>

<LD>Olympic luger Becky Wilczak of River Forest, Ill., could face an
agonizing conflict at Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   Her father, Tom, has been awaiting a liver transplant since 1984 but
was moved to the highest priority when his health deteriorated in
October. The 55-year-old information technology specialist has an
autoimmune disease that causes his body to attack his own liver, and
medication hasn't helped.</LD>
<LD>   Giving him a section of a donor's liver was ruled out because at 5
feet 10 and 270 pounds--some of that weight a result of his illness--he'd
need too big a piece for a living donor to give up.</LD>
<TE>   "Mentally, it's changed me and put life into perspective," Wilczak
said of juggling training and concern for her father. "It put things into
focus."</TE>
<TE>   If a liver became available for her father during the Games, she said
she wouldn't hesitate to forgo her Olympic debut.</TE>
<TE>   "My gut feeling is, I'd want to be with my family," she said. "I'd
have to talk to my family and my coaches.... It's definitely been a
struggle being away from my family to train."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Wilczak, being treated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in
Chicago, would normally attend his daughter's competitions but became too
ill this season to travel. However, he plans to be at Salt Lake City one
way or another.</TE>
<TE>   'I have reservations and we rented a house and the grandkids are going
to be there," he said. "Becky going to the Olympics is a dream she's had
for many years, and anything we can do to help, we will."</TE>

<HD>Friday Remains Target for O'Neal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DENVER
</DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal did not make the trip here, affording him another
day-and-a-half off his ailing feet, even as he moved closer to returning
to the floor.</LD>
<LD>   The wide assumption is that O'Neal will play Friday against the
Phoenix Suns, though the final decision will be left to him.</LD>
<LD>   "There's nothing to be gained by keeping him out any longer," Phil
Jackson said. "The only thing I'm worried about, they're going to run
screen-and-roll all night and he's going to be on the exterior part of
the court playing defense on the screen-and-roll. They'll have him be
real active.</LD>
<TE>   "I think Shaq still moves well. He just isn't as explosive as he was
before."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have played 11 road games in two months, fewer than any
team in basketball other than the Clippers, who played their ninth road
game Wednesday night in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   That means a lot of wake-up calls and unfriendly places for the next
two months, which is OK with Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   "We miss the challenge of looking each other in the eye," Bryant said,
"when everybody's booing you and everybody thinks you're going to lose
the game, and somehow you manage to pull together and win it. That's what
we're missing right now."</TE>
<TE>   In four games with O'Neal on the injured list, Devean George made 16
of 28 field-goal attempts, including four of seven three-pointers, and
averaged 10.5 points. He is more aggressive, purposely.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things, when the star player's out everyone tries to pick
it up in the scoring department," George said. "But we want to keep doing
the same things we're doing so once he comes back we'll be better off.</TE>
<TE>   "When he's in there, he's such a dominant player, we all tend to throw
him the ball and take the easy way out instead of running the offense.
That's the easy way, throwing it to him and letting him do the work."</TE>
<TE>   On the verge of a terribly difficult part of their schedule, Jackson
doesn't care much about bringing his players' psyches together.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've been doing fine as far as the group goes," Jackson
said. "But I think it's the ... sporadic nature of the games we've had
that have kept our timing and rhythm off as a team. You play a lot of
games you find a rhythm."</TE>
<TE>   So, January and February, when the Lakers play 29 games, is a good
thing?</TE>
<TE>   "No," he said. "Who wants to play five games in seven days?"</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal and Bryant are Nos. 1 and 2 in Western Conference all-star
balloting, and well ahead at their positions.</TE>
<TE>   According to Wednesday's tally, O'Neal leads Vlade Divac, the
second-place center, by more than 500,000 votes. Bryant leads Steve
Francis by nearly 350,000 votes.</TE>

<LD>Darius Miles was feeling better Wednesday after missing Monday's
practice because of illness.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Olowokandi played Wednesday against the Sacramento Kings after
sitting out Tuesday's game against the Portland Trail Blazers because of
food poisoning.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Piatkowski reported no ill effects from playing 25 minutes
against the Trail Blazers. His strained hip flexor gave him no trouble.</LD>
<TE>   Lamar Odom shot baskets before the Clippers played the Kings, then
decided it was time to test his sprained right wrist.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, but surely the Clippers are getting healthy.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel we can be a very effective team if we get everybody back
healthy," Coach Alvin Gentry said. "But injuries are part of the NBA.
That's why you're not supposed to talk about them."</TE>
<TE>   Some players might have missed a few games in an effort to soothe an
injured left knee, but not Corey Maggette. He has played in all 31 games.
After scoring 13 points in 30 minutes Tuesday against Portland, Maggette
said, "I'm a warrior."</TE>
<TE>   Piatkowski, a Nebraska alum and the Clippers' resident college
football expert, offered no predictions for his beloved Cornhuskers in
the Rose Bowl tonight against the Miami Hurricanes. He would allow that
he was dead wrong about Pacific 10 Conference champion Oregon, which
routed Colorado of the Big 12 in the Fiesta Bowl on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Piatkowski on the state of the Clippers after 30 games: "I don't feel
as though we're playing good basketball right now. But we have been
winning. In the past with the Clippers, I felt we had to play a perfect
game to win. When we have put it all together this season, that's when
we've won by 20 or 30 points like we did against Indiana and Seattle."</TE>

<LD>To duplicate the remarkable season the Huntington Beach Edison
girls' soccer team enjoyed a year ago would be nearly impossible. After
all, the Chargers went undefeated in Sunset League play and didn't allow
a goal to a league opponent until Esperanza scored in the final game of
the regular season.</LD>
<LD>   On top of that, Edison lost three backfield players to graduation.</LD>
<LD>   So the Chargers' strong start this season at 12-1-2, with victories
over Dana Hills, Buena and San Clemente, has caught everyone by surprise,
including Coach Kerry Crooks.</LD>
<TE>   "I knew that we had the talent but we didn't have the experience,"
Crooks said. "But they've proved me wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers, No. 8 in The Times' rankings, host Huntington Beach
Marina in a league opener today. The showdown with No. 4 Esperanza
(12-1-0) is Jan. 15.</TE>
<TE>   "League [play] is going to be a cat fight," said Crooks, whose team
lost to Mission Viejo in the Southern Section Division II semifinals last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Edison is led by forward Brooke Thulin, the league's offensive most
valuable player last season. She has nine goals and seven assists this
season. Goalkeeper Jenna Huff has 11 shutouts and has allowed only three
goals.</TE>
<TE>   Crooks calls Huff "the best goalkeeper in [Orange] County."</TE>
<TE>   "A team would have to be amazing to score more than one goal."</TE>
<TE>   Crooks has been the Chargers' coach for 12 seasons. She also coaches
the women's team at Vanguard University in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd love for them to go to Vanguard," Crooks said of Thulin and Huff,
who have already made their college choices: Thulin will attend Brigham
Young University and Huff will play at Nevada Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   California clash: Concord Carondolet will test its No. 3 national
ranking against some of Southern California's finest this week.
Carondolet will play at Santa Margarita, No. 1 in The Times' rankings,
today, then at No. 10 Mater Dei on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Carondolet already lost to one Orange County team last week, when No.
6 Corona del Mar won, 4-1, in the first round of the host Cougars'
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Allison Harvey's two goals propelled the Sea Kings past Carondolet and
into the finals of the four-team tournament, in which they lost in
sudden-death overtime to Amador Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Odds and endings: Santa Margarita Coach Chuck Morales tried to
downplay his team's strength last week, but the Eagles made a strong case
for their perch atop the region's rankings.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita shut out Anaheim Canyon, West Hills Chaminade, Garden
Grove Pacifica and finally, Newport Harbor, 4-0, to ends its run to the
championship of the Excalibur tournament....</TE>
<TE>   La Verne Bonita (17-1) had its undefeated run ended with a 1-0 loss to

<LD>The offensive most-valuable-player trophy Devin Hester took home to
Florida carried the likeness of a traditional running back striking a
pose. But Hester and his teammates used unconventional athleticism and
creative play-making to lead Florida past California, 34-24, in the third
annual CaliFlorida Bowl on Wednesday at El Camino College.</LD>
<LD>   Hester's 85-yard kickoff return in the first half tied the score, 7-7.
It started Florida's display of athletic football that at times seemed to
bewilder California.</LD>
<LD>   "We play a lot of roll-out, take-it-as-it-happens ball," said Hester,
a 5-foot-11, 180-pound Riviera Beach Suncoast High product who had 20
touchdown receptions last season. "We're not going to let anybody take us
out of our game."</LD>
<TE>   Hester had only three catches for 11 yards, but his electrifying
kickoff return set the stage for quarterback Gavin Dickey of Tallahassee
Lincoln. Dickey, Florida's Gatorade state player of the year, completed
six of 13 passes for 129 yards and engineered a nine-play, 93-yard drive
that resulted in a five-yard scoring run by James Jackson that gave
Florida a 14-7 first-quarter lead.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of guys who are playmakers," said Dickey, who helped
Florida build a 21-10 halftime lead and is considering Florida, Clemson
and USC. "That's something you can't teach or coach. I think the style we
played made California uneasy at times."</TE>
<TE>   California's fate was sealed with 5:27 left when Florida lineman
Baraka Atkins of Sarasota Booker recovered a snap over the head of
quarterback Drew Olson of Piedmont and scored to make it 34-17.</TE>
<TE>   California failed to produce a sustained scoring drive until late in
the fourth quarter when quarterback Ben Olson of Thousand Oaks threaded a
26-yard scoring pass to James Finley of Manual Arts to make the score,
34-24. Finley had five receptions for 102 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "[Florida] has a bunch of great athletes with a different style," said
Ben Olson, who completed 10 of 11 passes for 118 yards. "We just made too
many mistakes and gave [Florida] too many opportunities to do what
they're good at."</TE>

<HD>Coach Wants Los Alamitos, Polls Apart</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Ortega</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coach Trey Scharlin understands why rankings exist, but he prefers
his Los Alamitos High boys' soccer team not be included in them.</LD>
<LD>   Particularly in the first month of the season.</LD>
<LD>   That is a time for his team to develop the chemistry and skills
necessary for making a run at a league title, according to Scharlin, not
to concern itself with polls.</LD>
<TE>   "I've seen what rankings can do to a team," said Scharlin, who is in
his fourth season at Los Alamitos. "My first year here, we had 19 seniors
on the team and they were all excited because we were ranked second in
[Orange County] in one poll. But they seemed to forget that they had to
win games to maintain that ranking. So ever since then, I've tried to
keep a low profile until later in the season."</TE>
<TE>   So Scharlin refrains from calling newspapers with results from his
team's games during the first part of the season and does not return
preseason questionnaires until the season is several weeks old.</TE>
<TE>   "I avoid any early press for my team," Scharlin wrote in an e-mail
last week. "Many teams and players get wrapped up in the rankings and
results and forget to focus on the job at hand, winning games and
returning as league champs.... Thanks for your understanding and not
ranking us."</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos (12-1-1) could be in The Times' rankings as early as next
week if the Griffins defeat sixth-ranked Fountain Valley in a Sunset
League opener on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Clamoring for attention: While Scharlin has downplayed his team's
accomplishments, Quartz Hill player Kiel McClung said he and his
teammates have been overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   Before beginning play in the Simi Valley Royal tournament Wednesday,
Quartz Hill had outscored opponents, 52-9, and posted six shutouts during
a 10-0 start.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the attitude out there is, 'Oh, they can't be that good.
They're from the Antelope Valley,"' McClung said. "'They're just those
valley boys who can't be that good in soccer."'</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An encouraging performance: Santa Margarita lost to touted Irvine
Woodbridge, 2-0, in the championship game of the Mission Viejo Trabuco
Hills tournament Saturday, but it was hard for Coach Curt Bauer to find
fault with his team.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles (14-2-2) were missing six starters, including All-Southern
Section Division III second-team selection Matt Basin, because of
injuries or concussions, and they started three junior varsity players.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our depth is going to be helped [by having played all these
different players]," Bauer said. "But we lack continuity. Our set plays
are a mess right now because we haven't had anyone together for very
long. They haven't been together long enough to know what the other guy
is going to do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A depleted roster: Temecula Chaparral (11-1-1) will be without three
starters for games against Mira Loma Jurupa Valley today and Norco on
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Bush, a defender, will miss the games after suffering a
concussion last week.</TE>
<TE>   Garreth Moore, a sweeper, and Steve Berg, a midfielder, will be on
vacations with their families.</TE>
<TE>   Bush was knocked unconscious early in the second half of last
Thursday's game against Rialto.</TE>

<HD>Rounding Out the Seminary Curricula</HD>
<DH>Religion: Pakistan wants its madrasas to include history, languages
and science so students become educated men, and not just Islamic
zealots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PESHAWAR, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>The young men who sat cross-legged on the rug, squeezed into a
semicircle around the seminary's principal, are the mullahs of tomorrow.
Most are poor and from the countryside and not yet old enough to have
full, bushy beards.</LD>
<LD>   On the admission applications they clutched in their hands, they had
agreed not to smoke, get "English-style" haircuts, question decisions of
the seminary or join political movements. They had promised to bathe at
least once a week, be respectful of teachers, keep the school clean and
be good Muslims.</LD>
<LD>   Abdur Rahmad, 17, waited nervously for his turn. He ran his hand over
the few hairs on his chin. He had, he said, already memorized half the
Koran on his own but knew that his study of Islam was far from complete.
When the principal asked him what he would do with the knowledge that
awaited him here, Abdur answered, "I will return to my village in
Afghanistan and be a teacher of Islam."</LD>
<TE>   Over the years, tens of thousands of students like Abdur have gone
forth from Pakistan's estimated 5,000 madrasas, or seminaries, armed with
the narrowest interpretation of a religion that in more than 1,400 years
has never undergone a renaissance or a reformation. Some went as teachers
to rally the fervor of Islam, others to fight in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The schools have turned Pakistan into a factory for moujahedeen, or
holy warriors.</TE>
<TE>   With the U.S.-led war on terrorism now in its fourth month, the
madrasas have become a source of concern to Pakistan's government, which
wants them to broaden their curricula to include history, languages and
science so graduates become educated men dedicated to national
development, and not just religious zealots and a source of moujahedeen.</TE>
<TE>   The 700-student Darrul-ulloom Sarhad madrasa in Peshawar is no
exception. Principal Sahibzada Ahmad Banoori's father founded the madrasa
more than 50 years ago; then, as now, the foot soldiers of Islam who left
the school after three or four years of free education would have learned
to recite all 77,934 words of the Koran by heart, although that was about
all they would have learned. The recitation in Arabic takes about 10
hours.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the madrasas, stung by a national crackdown on extremism, have
agreed to offer a more well-rounded education--somewhat reluctantly.</TE>
<TE>   "We teach only the goodness of Islam and don't teach hate against any
nation or other religion," Banoori said after the students left to find
classrooms on the first day of school. "We never encouraged or gave
incentives to students so they would become moujahedeen. Of course, if
they made that choice on their own, it is out of our hands."</TE>
<TE>   Undeniably, however, Pakistani officials point out, anti-Western
sentiments are nurtured in the madrasas.</TE>
<TE>   The madrasas do not offer military training, but in a country where
anyone can buy a Kalashnikov rifle on the open market for $250, that
instruction is readily available elsewhere. What they do offer is such an
unworldly and narrow view of life that students invariably consider
anything non-Muslim as anti-Islam and godless. This leads to cries for
jihad.</TE>
<TE>   Islam--which translates as "submission" to God--has five obligations:
accepting one God and Muhammad as his prophet; daily prayer; giving alms
to the needy; fasting during the holy month of Ramadan; and making the
hajj, or pilgrimage, to Mecca.</TE>
<TE>   Some include a sixth pillar: jihad. Although the word has ominous
overtones in the West, jihad merely means to struggle for Islam. One can
wage a jihad against poverty or illiteracy. Only in its extreme does it
refer to war.</TE>
<TE>   "Religious fanatics sit idly in the mosques and madrasas," said Jafri
Abul Hasan, a retired journalist. "They don't have jobs. They're
influenced, even brainwashed, by mullahs. The fact is, they really don't
know what they're doing. The mullah says, 'Do this, do that,' and they do
it. But this isn't the Islam the vast majority of us believe in or
practice."</TE>
<TE>   Hasan points out that most of the world's 1 billion Muslims embrace
the tolerance and compassion of a religion that bears many similarities
to Christianity. Muslims accept Jesus Christ as a prophet (though not as
the son of God) and venerate Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jacob and Job.
They believe in the resurrection of the body and in the concept of heaven
and hell. One major difference in Islam is that the prophet Muhammad was
entirely mortal and did not perform miracles.</TE>
<TE>   "There were volunteers from every madrasa in Pakistan who went to
fight against the Soviets and later for the Taliban," said one mullah,
Maulana Jalic Jan. "Some used to spend their summer vacations fighting.
Then they'd go back to school.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't surprising, because thousands of Muslims are being killed
every day in wars led by the West and no one takes notice. But if a few
Christians or Jews are killed somewhere, everyone is up in arms."</TE>
<TE>   One irony in the increasing prominence of the madrasas is that their
growth was, to a large degree, the result of CIA efforts during the Cold
War.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA saw Islam as an important force against the Soviets, and with
U.S. backing, the madrasas became the training ground for the fighters
who defeated the Soviet Union in Afghanistan in 1989 after nearly a
decade of war. That success further emboldened young fanatics to believe
that their faith was stronger than the military might of any superpower.</TE>
<TE>   "You Americans created this phenomenon, and now you're trying to
figure out how to deprogram it," a Pakistani intelligence officer said.</TE>

<HD>As a U.S. Ally in War, Britain Remains First Among Equals</HD>
<DH>Military: Air marshal's presence and clout at Central Command in
Tampa reflect close ties. Blair is credited with cementing relationship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Just six days after the terrorist attacks on America, and three
weeks before U.S. bombs began raining down on Afghanistan, British Air
Marshal G.E. "Jock" Stirrup arrived at the U.S. Central Command here. He
was the first coalition leader to take his place in the war room beside
U.S. Army Gen. Tommy Franks.</LD>
<LD>   Since those early days, Britain has unofficially remained Ally No. 1
in the war on terrorism. As the most steadfast supporter of U.S. military
policy, it has offered more soldiers than any other allied nation. Its
pilots and special forces are in harm's way, and its ground troops are
leading an international peacekeeping force in Afghanistan's capital,
Kabul.</LD>
<LD>   The level of commitment is a reflection of the traditionally close
relationship--military and otherwise--between the two countries, cemented
in prior wars. But it also has to do with the personality of British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, according to British observers.</LD>
<TE>   "There is a straightforward foreign policy calculation that the U.S.
is our closest ally and when something awful happens you have to act,"
said Lawrence Freedman, head of war studies at King's College, London.
"But it's also the sort of guy Blair is. He has a strong moral stance and
prides himself on seeing right and wrong quickly."</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen how far Britain is prepared to go as the war on
terrorism moves beyond Afghanistan. But with at least 37 Britons believed
to have trained in Al Qaeda terrorist camps, the continuation of British
involvement may be inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Freedman says Blair might be willing to continue helping if the U.S.
carries the anti-terrorism campaign to Somalia or Yemen. "It depends on
what is being proposed," he said. Iraq would be "difficult. But it's not
as if the Americans have a plan yet."</TE>
<TE>   Britain's status at Central Command headquarters in Tampa is
illustrated at the horseshoe-shaped table in the war room where the
Taliban's demise was conceived. At the helm, next to Franks and his
deputy, Marine Corps Gen. Michael de Long, sits Stirrup. The chairs of
the generals of 21 nations who meet each morning at 9 are assigned by
rank, and Britain ordered up a general outranked only by Franks.</TE>
<TE>   Both in Kabul and at Central Command, Britain has installed generals
to serve as linchpins in the uniquely close alliance. Maj. Gen. John
McColl last weekend led the first Afghan-British joint patrols in Kabul.
Significantly, the British Defense Ministry sent the more senior official
to Tampa.</TE>
<TE>   "The special relationship that we enjoy with the United Kingdom is
reflected in the fact that they assigned a three-star officer here," said
Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, chief spokesman for the Central Command.</TE>
<TE>   It's also reflected in the size of the British contingent here--and
its unsurpassed access. Britain has sent 60 military strategists and
support staff to Central Command, more than any other U.S. ally. It also
occupies more real estate--three tan-and-brown trailers beneath a Union
Jack in a former parking lot known as "Coalition Village." While other
coalition leaders labor in wheeled, no-frills offices without plumbing,
Stirrup occupies coveted space in the three-story CentCom headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Britain has sent 4,000 troops to the war zone, including an
unspecified number of special forces on the ground in Afghanistan. The
British-led International Security Assistance Force is expected
eventually to include up to 5,000 soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to detail the role of special forces soldiers on the ground, as
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has done on occasion, Stirrup said,
"We don't do that. Suffice it to say that we have been continually
involved."</TE>
<TE>   But according to British media reports, when CIA agents were under
attack in November at a prison uprising in the northern Afghan city of
Mazar-i-Sharif, it was British forces who directed airstrikes there.</TE>
<TE>   British MI5 agents, along with their counterparts in the FBI and CIA,
are said to be interrogating pro-Taliban prisoners. British aircraft are
carrying out intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, air transport,
maritime patrol and midair refueling missions. Her majesty's submarines,
which fired Tomahawk missiles at Taliban targets in the opening volley of
the bombing campaign, still patrol the Arabian Sea.</TE>
<TE>   On the broader anti-terrorism front, a U.S. official in London last
week characterized the cooperation between U.S. and British law
enforcement as "the closest in Europe" and said the British are highly
skilled at evidence collection, thanks in part to their history of
investigating Irish Republican Army bombings and other terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We have sought to make a significant military contribution to this
campaign from the outset," said Stirrup, whose title in Tampa is senior
British military advisor. "Let's face it, even the largest military power
in the world at some stage runs short of military assets."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the obvious language and cultural ties, the U.S.-British
alliance has grown steadily since World War II, when it was cemented in
the Roosevelt-Churchill partnership. When Britain waged war in the
Falklands in 1982, the United States offered enough military aid that
Queen Elizabeth II awarded Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger an
honorary knighthood. And former British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's support for President George Bush's buildup to the Persian
Gulf War was so dramatic that wags quipped she gave him the "backbone
transplant" he needed to stand up to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "Britain has always seen its strategic advantage in lying as a bridge
between Europe and the United States," said Anthony Cordesman, a senior
foreign affairs analyst at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington. "The close partnership with the United States
gives it a political power and status it did not have as a member of
Europe."</TE>
<TE>   The relationship has undergone a generational change. The youthful
Blair is the current President Bush's most vocal ally, offering more
personnel and materiel than the anti-Taliban coalition has been able to
absorb and testifying to the world--long before the release in
mid-December of a dramatic videotape--that he had seen secret evidence
proving Osama bin Laden's guilt in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The oft-referenced special relationship has been fodder for espionage
novelists from Ian Fleming to John le Carre. But the nonfiction
partnership in the Afghan war stands Fleming on his head, with Franks as
a relatively austere and straight-laced American version of James Bond
and the comparatively dashing Stirrup as a British Felix Leiter,
Fleming's CIA agent whose well-timed arrivals extract Bond from
near-fatal scrapes.</TE>
<TE>   Stirrup, 52, began assembling the team he would send to MacDill Air
Force Base, CentCom's host base, three days after two passenger jets
penetrated the steel and glass of the World Trade Center. He was drawn in
part by personal ties. He had celebrated his silver wedding anniversary
in New York the week before Sept. 11. He arrived in Tampa on Sept. 17 as
Bush was still issuing vague warnings of the military conflict that would
not begin until Oct. 7.</TE>
<TE>   "It quickly became evident that the United States was looking at a
number of possible military options," Stirrup said. "And they would be
planned here at CentCom."</TE>
<TE>   Stirrup's brief tenure in Florida has meant enduring some ribbing.
After he and Australian Brig. Gen. Ken Gillespie spoke at a recent news
conference, Franks cracked a smile and, in a Texas twang reminiscent of
former presidential candidate Ross Perot, said: "I must confess that the
language characteristics of some of [the coalition's] members leaves
something to be desired."</TE>
<TE>   Stirrup is expected to return to London on Jan. 17, to be replaced by
Lt. Gen. Cedric Delves. But the British delegation, like those of the
rest of the coalition, is likely to remain long thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   "The United Kingdom has always made clear that the purpose of this
campaign is to remove terrorism as a force in international affairs,"
Stirrup said. "Clearly that does not necessarily end in Afghanistan."</TE>

<HD>13 More Bodies Recovered at World Trade Center Site</HD>
<DH>Dead: Remains of 10 firefighters and three civilians are pulled
from an underground pocket. Workers hope for 'more closure' in the new
year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>In a city where the contrast between joy and tragedy has been
sharpened by the events of Sept. 11, New Year's Day proved to be no
exception.</LD>
<LD>   Only hours after hundreds of thousands of revelers celebrated the
beginning of 2002 in Times Square, firefighters pulled the bodies of 10
of their comrades and three civilians from the rubble of the World Trade
Center, it was revealed Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The remains were discovered in what was once the lobby of one of the
twin towers. It was the biggest recovery in three weeks, once again
underscoring the determination of crews that continue to toil nonstop at
the complex.</LD>
<TE>   "It is demanding, emotional. It is very stressful," said Tom Da Parma,
a trustee of the Uniformed Firefighters Assn., the union that announced
the find.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole United States, the whole country has done a phenomenal job
in supporting us," Da Parma said. "A lot of the firemen are feeding off
this.</TE>
<TE>   "With the new year coming, a lot of people believe there will be more
closure, and that will be a tremendous boost for the rescue workers."</TE>
<TE>   The bodies were discovered deep underground in pockets that were
formed when some of the steel beams of the structures collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Workers at the site believe they are finally reaching an area where
many of the people who tried to flee the twin towers were trapped.</TE>
<TE>   Officials estimate 2,936 people were killed or are missing and
presumed dead in the trade center attack. These include 343 firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   In what has become a well-established ritual, whenever a body is
found, it is covered by an American flag and carried from the site.</TE>
<TE>   Family members are then notified, depending on their preferences. In
some cases, relatives are ranked in order of notification, with notations
on whether they wish to be awakened to be told late at night or early in
the morning.</TE>
<TE>   "People are notified in person," Da Parma said.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, a relative will accompany firefighters to notify other
family members that a body has been found and identified.</TE>
<TE>   "There might be a brother wanting to ride out to tell the wife or
three of [the firefighter's] close friends," Da Parma explained.</TE>
<TE>   Some firefighters have wanted to leave their firehouses when they are
on duty to retrieve the body of a colleague once it is found in the
rubble. But fire officials object to the practice, fearing fire
protection would be compromised.</TE>
<TE>   Da Parma said the union is trying to reach a compromise with the fire
department so "we can get some of the brothers to go down there."</TE>
<TE>   The Uniformed Firefighters Assn. also is seeking funds for an
independent study of the air quality at the trade center complex, despite
reassurances from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that the
public is not being exposed to excessive levels of harmful substances.</TE>
<TE>   "I have 300 to 400 [firefighters] out on medical leave for respiratory
problems," said Thomas Manley, the union's health and safety officer.
"For the most part, it is being resolved with antibiotics. But we don't
know the long-term effects."</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters spend 30 days at the site before they are reassigned.</TE>

<LD>The federal government recently bought 1.6 million doses of a drug
that protects against certain kinds of radioactive fallout and will buy
at least 6 million additional doses in the coming year to create a large
national stockpile, the Department of Health and Human Services said.</LD>
<LD>   Department officials had not announced the purchase of potassium
iodide but did so after an article appeared in the Washington Post
earlier this week in which some experts lamented the lack of a stockpile
to deal with a possible terrorist attack on a nuclear power plant.</LD>

<HD>The Road to Reform Is Rough, Fox Finds</HD>
<DH>Mexico: Lawmakers' watered-down tax plan shows the president's
weakness, analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>Thirteen months after he took office with promises to modernize
Mexico, President Vicente Fox greets the new year with a much meeker
version of the radical fiscal reform he once sought.</LD>
<LD>   Mexico badly needs to plug the holes in a feeble tax-collection system
that has left the country heavily dependent on oil exports, a volatile
source of income, analysts say. The nation boasts the second-largest
economy in Latin America but has one of the worst tax-collection rates in
the region.</LD>
<LD>   Fox's bold remedy, which relied on taxing food, medicine and books,
apparently proved too politically unpalatable for lawmakers to swallow.
Instead, Congress this week approved a watered-down version of the plan
that will raise about half the money Fox had sought.</LD>
<TE>   "Ultimately, I don't even think you can call this fiscal reform," said
Denise Dresser, a senior fellow at the Pacific Council on International
Policy in Los Angeles. "It's certainly not a victory for the Fox
administration in any sense."</TE>
<TE>   The fate of the financial package highlights the difficulties Fox
faces as he tries to hoist Mexico out of the ranks of poor countries. The
former Coca-Cola executive, whose election ended 71 years of
authoritarian rule under the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI,
had hoped that sweeping tax reforms would prompt a Standard &amp; Poor's
upgrade of Mexican bonds, opening the spigot for more foreign investment.</TE>
<TE>   Although the debt upgrade may yet happen, some observers say that
Fox's failure to win a broad tax reform reflects poorly on his ability to
control the nation's agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows that the president is very weak," said Jose Antonio Crespo,
a political science professor at the Center for Economic Research and
Teaching in Mexico City. "He tried to publicly pressure the Congress, and
he failed completely. Even though he is popular, he cannot achieve what
he wants."</TE>
<TE>   Fox on Wednesday praised the limited tax increases as vital steps
toward steadying the national economy even as he lamented that they don't
go further.</TE>
<TE>   "This does not satisfy the requirements for a modern reform of the
Mexican economy," Fox said. "However, it lets us visualize some progress
in the year 2002. . . . As I said when this government took office, the
executive proposes and the legislature decides. Such is democracy."</TE>
<TE>   One of the highest-profile efforts of his administration, Fox's fiscal
reform plan sparked controversy as soon as he unveiled it in April.
Opponents charged that raising taxes on basic necessities would devastate
poor families, who spend up to half their incomes on food. Even members
of Fox's own National Action Party voiced doubts.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's original reform plan aimed to raise 120 billion pesos, or about
$13.2 billion. No party claims a working majority in Congress, and the
centrist PRI and the center-left Democratic Revolution Party pounced on
the unpopular tax proposal to win support in several local elections. By
the fall, with a shrinking economy pinched by falling oil prices and the
U.S. recession, the three major parties were leaning toward a tax package
that would inflict less pain on their constituents.</TE>
<TE>   After months of debate, Congress agreed on a budget that whittled
expected revenue from new taxes to about 60 billion pesos, or $6.6
billion. The plan boosts taxes on soft drinks, cigarettes, alcohol,
cellular phone use and luxury goods such as smoked salmon and fur coats.</TE>
<TE>   "The tax increase does put Mexico's budget on a somewhat sounder
footing," said Michael Gavin, executive director of emerging markets
research at UBS Warburg in Stamford, Conn. "But it certainly seems to be
a missed opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Graciana del Castillo, Standard &amp; Poor's director of Latin American
sovereign ratings, said it could take at least a week to analyze the
measure and decide whether Mexico merits an investment-grade rating.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been saying we want to see an improvement in public finances to
make the government less dependent on oil and to increase the amount of
total tax revenue," she said. "Obviously, this tax reform will have an
impact."</TE>

<HD>India and Pakistan Sound Conciliatory</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Warning that the situation between the nuclear nations
remains dangerous, U.S. officials note an apparent effort to avoid war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>U.S. officials said Wednesday they were beginning to see signs that
tensions are easing between India and Pakistan after a three-week
standoff that included a buildup of military forces on their border.</LD>
<LD>   As President Bush continued diplomatic efforts, White House and State
Department officials cited conciliatory statements by Indian and
Pakistani officials. They said Pakistan's government has continued to
take steps against terrorist groups based in the country, as India has
urged it to do.</LD>
<LD>   "There are certainly indications that India and Pakistan have moved
beyond where we were a week ago, or even before the weekend," said one
U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   Officials said that the confrontation between the two nuclear powers
remained dangerous and that the nations needed to continue their efforts.</TE>
<TE>   India and Pakistan, which have fought three wars since independence
from Britain in 1947, have been at the brink of another one since a
terrorist assault on India's Parliament on Dec. 13. India has blamed the
attack, which killed 14 people, on Kashmiri separatists based in
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Cross-border transportation between the countries has been curtailed,
diplomatic contacts have been scaled back and both governments have
rushed troops toward the 1,800-mile-long border.</TE>
<TE>   But in the last few days, the leaders of the nations have been making
more positive statements and gestures.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan has arrested militants, seized assets of some groups and
taken steps to close down their operations.</TE>
<TE>   In Katmandu, Nepal, Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh and his
counterpart from Pakistan, Abdus Sattar, smiled and shook hands during a
preparatory meeting for a regional summit that begins Friday.</TE>
<TE>   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher noted that Indian Defense
Minister George Fernandes said Indian troops on the border were not in
battle position.</TE>
<TE>   "We are pleased to see that Pakistan and India continue to take steps
to defuse the tensions between them," he said. "We do think that each of
these countries is acting responsibly in order to avoid a conflict."</TE>
<TE>   Bush, who last weekend stepped up U.S. efforts to promote peace,
talked about the situation Wednesday with British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, who is traveling to the region for talks.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. official noted that the government of Pakistani President
Pervez Musharraf has also banned inflammatory posters, taken away
collection boxes used to solicit money, and is trying to figure out how
to reshape fundamentalist Islamic schools.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, U.S. officials and private experts predicted it would be
tough for Pakistan to root out all those in the government who have been
sympathetic to the extremists.</TE>
<TE>   Terence Taylor of the London-based International Institute for
Strategic Studies, a private research group, said that although there
have been hopeful signs in recent days, the situation remains dangerous
because so many people in both countries have stakes in the conflict. He
particularly cited Islamic fundamentalists in Pakistan who are eager to
foment a crisis that could unseat the pro-Western Musharraf government.</TE>
<TE>   "That, to me, is the great danger," said Taylor, who works from an
office in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   A delegation of nine U.S. senators is heading today to South Asia and
plans to take up the India-Pakistan dispute in addition to meeting with
U.S. troops in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) told a news conference that he and
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) are leading the delegation on an eight-day
trip. They plan to visit countries including Pakistan, Uzbekistan,
Tajikistan and Turkey. Lieberman said the senators will appeal for
"moderation and the kind of restraint that will defuse a very difficult
situation."</TE>

<HD>Year Gets Off to a Flaky Start in the South</HD>
<DH>Weather: Children play but travelers wait as a winter storm brings
unexpected joys and pains. Eight inches of snow is expected to fall.</DH>

<DL>ATLANTA
</DL>
<LD>Snowmen, small but spunky, dotted front lawns in Alabama. The
chicken and okra gumbo was going fast among shivering diners in Baton
Rouge, La. And in rural Georgia, a herd of cattle huddled close in cold
bewilderment.</LD>
<LD>   "They think the sky is falling," their owner, Angela Hill, explained.</LD>
<LD>   It was, of course, only snow. But snow is a rare treat--or
curse--around here. And Wednesday brought plenty of it, all across the
Southeast.</LD>
<TE>   From Louisiana to North Carolina, a winter storm ushered in the new
year with snow, sleet and bitter cold (bitter, that is, by the South's
standards, with temperatures dropping into the 20s). Meteorologists
predicted up to 8 inches of snow in parts of the region, with the
heaviest accumulation in north Georgia and the Carolinas.</TE>
<TE>   The weather caused a fair share of trouble. Icy roads in Mississippi
were blamed for three deaths. "We've literally had wrecks upon wrecks,"
Highway Patrol Master Sgt. Walter Armstrong said. "We even had two patrol
cars hit."</TE>
<TE>   Some highways were briefly closed in Louisiana. State offices shut
down early Wednesday in parts of Georgia and South Carolina, sending
workers home as road conditions worsened.</TE>
<TE>   At Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport--normally the nation's
busiest--hundreds of flights were canceled and others delayed for hours.
Though the runways were clear, the airport has only a dozen pads to
de-ice planes. That was not enough. By late afternoon, planes were lined
up nose-to-tail waiting for takeoff clearance. Some passengers reported
being stranded on the tarmac for three hours; others, their flights
scratched, paced the airport grumbling about the unexpected extension of
their new year's holiday.</TE>
<TE>   By 4:30 p.m. PST, management consultant Alex Zuccarelli's plane had
been waiting on the tarmac for three hours; so many planes had been
grounded that there were no gates free for hers to park. Her dinner had
been two biscotti and an orange. Her prospects of making a connecting
flight to a consulting job in South Carolina looked bleak. And the mood
on her Boeing 757 could not be described as holiday cheer.</TE>
<TE>   "People are tired, hungry and a little antsy," Zuccarelli said. She
looked out the window. The snow was starting to fall in earnest. She
lives in Denver; she knows snow. This did not look good. Zuccarelli
revised her assessment of the mood. Antsy no longer cut it. People are on
the verge of being very angry, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the airport, though, there were plenty of smiles as the flakes
fell. In Atlanta, kids grabbed metal lids off garbage cans and careened
down their driveways on the makeshift sleds. In Alabama, there were
plenty of snowmen--even if children had to scrape every last corner of
their yard bare to collect enough of the white stuff to make a good one.
Throughout the region, kids tried their hand at snowball fights.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't snow very frequently here, so when it does, it's like a
national play day," Hill said as she drove off to deliver extra hay to
her herd.</TE>
<TE>   Though the cows looked to be terrified--"they're clustering together
like a bunch of grapes," Hill scoffed--their owner was clearly entranced.
The weather matched the Christmas decorations she had strung all over the
bed and breakfast she runs, the Georgian Inn in Greenville, Ga. "It's
beautiful. Everything is white, white, white."</TE>
<TE>   In nearby LaGrange, Ga., Mike Joyce, manager of the Highland Country
Club, echoed her reverie. He lost about $1,200 worth of business when he
decided to shut down his restaurant Wednesday afternoon, before the roads
got too bad. And he had to cancel a few dozen rounds scheduled at the
club's golf course. Still, he couldn't help but see the beauty: "It looks
like a picture postcard right now."</TE>
<TE>   The storm, caused by a low-pressure system over the Gulf of Mexico,
was "pretty unusual" because it was centered so far South, said Scott
Wendt, a meteorologist for Weather Central Inc. To be sure, it was
nothing compared to the monster snowfall that paralyzed Buffalo, N.Y.,
last week. But 7 inches of snow here compares with 7 feet there, at least
in terms of public reaction.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no experience with this," said Jim Ermen, a real estate
broker in Montgomery, Ala. "If the roads get icy, you get off the roads."</TE>
<TE>   A transplant from Detroit, Ermen considers himself a bad-weather
veteran. (He doesn't even try to tell his Southern friends stories about
Detroit's wintertime woes, he said, because they just don't understand.)
Yet for all his experience, he was as unprepared as any local for digging
out from a storm: "We divested ourselves of our snow shovel a long time
ago."</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, the snow in Ermen's neighborhood was light--no
shovel needed. Elsewhere in the South, however, folks rushed to stock up
on novelties that had suddenly become necessities as meteorologists
warned that the slush accumulating on many streets and driveways would
likely turn to ice by morning.</TE>
<TE>   "People are buying rock salt, kerosene and propane," said Dee
Hitchcock, a clerk at Bates Ace Hardware in Atlanta. That was about all
she could say; the rush that had kept her hopping all day showed no signs
of abating as dusk fell. "Ma'am, I don't mean to be rude," she said, "but
I have a line of people waiting at my register."</TE>

<HD>Zambia Swears In New Leader</HD>
<DH>Africa: Chosen by the outgoing president, Levy Mwanawasa takes
office after court rejects rivals' bid for a delay amid allegations of
vote rigging.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
</DL>
<LD>Zambia's ruling party candidate, handpicked by the outgoing leader,
was sworn in as president Wednesday amid allegations of vote rigging and
mounting political tension.</LD>
<LD>   Pledging to defend Zambia's constitution, Levy Mwanawasa, 53, was
inaugurated after a high court rejected an appeal by opposition
candidates to delay the ceremony until allegations of voting
irregularities were investigated.</LD>
<LD>   The court ruling followed a day of violence and looting in Lusaka, the
Zambian capital, as thousands of opposition supporters took their
dissatisfaction to the streets and clashed with police.</LD>
<TE>   In his inaugural address, Mwanawasa, once vice president to outgoing
President Frederick Chiluba, said he would not tolerate further unrest in
the typically peaceful nation in southern Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "I will defend the constitution and assure the vote is applied," he
said as 1,000 police officers patrolled the area around the inauguration
ceremony in the capital.</TE>
<TE>   As some local and foreign election monitors pointed to flaws in the
balloting, analysts said the controversy surrounding the run-up to the
vote and the results had taken a serious swipe at Zambia's fragile
democracy.</TE>
<TE>   "We could now see a questioning of the legitimacy of the government
and a stagnation to the country's democratic gains," said Ngande
Mwanajiti, chairman of Coalition 2001, a grouping of independent local
election monitors. He spoke by phone from Lusaka.</TE>
<TE>   An unprecedented 11 candidates competed Dec. 27 for the nation's top
job. Chiluba, who had ruled Zambia for the last decade, chose Mwanawasa
as the candidate for the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy. His
chief opponent was Anderson Mazoka of the United Party for National
Development.</TE>
<TE>   With all but two of 150 voting districts--with 15,000 votes--left to
report by late Wednesday, Zambia's election commission said Mwanawasa led
Mazoka by 34,777 votes.</TE>
<TE>   But several opposition parties have joined forces to challenge the
results, citing allegations of ballot-box stuffing and other government
shenanigans. The opponents have 14 days to file a petition contesting the
results. But observers said the procedure was more likely to be a
formality than to yield change.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of hard to undo an election once it's done," said one
Western official based in the Zambian capital.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the State Department urged the opposition groups to be
more specific in their allegations of vote rigging.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of Mazoka are calling for a rematch between him and
Mwanawasa, but analysts said that is highly unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition parties claim that the electoral process had also been
rigged to benefit the ruling party, with Mwanawasa enjoying the use of
state resources to campaign and the government-controlled media blatantly
endorsing him.</TE>
<TE>   "You can never say there was a level playing field," said Frederick
Mudenda, a political observer and law school lecturer at the University
of Zambia at Lusaka.</TE>
<TE>   Voters also cast ballots in parliamentary and local elections. The
tally in these polls was incomplete, but analysts said the large number
of parties competing for seats in parliament could lead to Zambia's first
coalition government.</TE>
<TE>   Mwanawasa "should look at the option of forming a government of
national unity to calm down the situation and maybe hold early
elections," said Robby Makayi, a special assistant to Mazoka. "It is
obvious that a power-sharing system should come into place now so we can
heal the wounds and put the nation back together."</TE>
<TE>   The new president has promised to reintroduce state subsidies for
agriculture, boost employment, bolster education and address widespread
poverty. More than 80% of Zambia's 9 million people live below the
poverty line of $1 a day, according to U.N. statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Mwanawasa has pledged to root out corruption, for which Chiluba's
government was widely criticized. Chiluba dismissed Mwanawasa from the
government in 1994 after Mwanawasa accused him of violating human rights
and condoning graft. Mwanawasa has vowed that no one will be allowed to
get away with plundering state resources.</TE>
<TE>   "There is talk of a clean-slate approach," the Western official said.
"Mwanawasa's contacts with the party are fairly distanced enough from the
baddies of the most recent administration that he may be able to get a
fresh start on things."</TE>
<TE>   An uneasy calm returned to Lusaka late Wednesday, with only sporadic
reports of violence, but street patrols continued.</TE>

<HD>Argentina's New President Is Expected to Devalue Peso</HD>
<DH>S. America: Currency's worth may drop 40% without peg to the U.S.
dollar. Tax collections plummet as citizens anticipate the move.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>Argentina's fifth president in two weeks took power Wednesday,
immediately confronting a worsening financial crisis, including a "fiscal
rebellion" among taxpayers that caused tax collections to drop by a third
in December.</LD>
<LD>   Expectations are that the new president, Eduardo Duhalde, will devalue
the currency as early as Friday by as much as 40%, abandoning the
one-to-one dollar peg that snuffed out hyperinflation in the early 1990s
but has stifled Argentina's economy since. Duhalde is expected to
announce his new Cabinet today and his economic package Friday.</LD>
<LD>   One day after being voted into office by an overwhelming majority of
senators and deputies at an emergency session of Congress, Duhalde, a
senator and former vice president from the Peronist party, was sworn in
at noon in the ornate White Room of the presidential palace. Just 10 days
earlier, the previous caretaker president, Adolfo Rodriguez Saa, had
assumed power in the same chamber.</LD>
<TE>   Crowded into the room were a cross-section of the provincial
governors, members of Congress and businesspeople who came together in a
rare display of support for Duhalde in the wake of the Dec. 30
resignation of Rodriguez after only a week in office. Duhalde did not
speak at the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "The overwhelming majority for Duhalde was proof there is
consciousness that the government must be strengthened by all the means
available if it is to emerge from the grave condition we are in today,"
said Guillermo Alchouron, a lawmaker and leader of the Action for the
Republic Party, one of the minority factions that rallied around Duhalde.</TE>
<TE>   But lacking a popular mandate, Duhalde faces difficult days ahead,
especially if reduced tax collections force the federal and local
governments to forgo payment of wages in coming weeks, which some
economists say is inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde must also find a way to kick-start Argentina's moribund
economy, which has been in recession four years. Miguel Garcia Merida, a
farmer from the Guamani district of Buenos Aires province who attended
Wednesday's ceremony, said crop prices have dropped 46% and demand is
down 70% since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on Duhalde's past experience as governor of our province, we
have hopes he is prepared to deal with this most difficult of situations
that Argentina has been left in," Garcia Merida said. "How bad is the
situation? I would say terminal."</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde is a leftist product of old-fashioned, working-class Peronism.
In true Peronist fashion, he instituted costly government make-work
programs in his two terms as Buenos Aires governor that left the province
deep in debt.</TE>
<TE>   As governor, Duhalde was tainted by charges of cronyism and
corruption. But, unlike Rodriguez, Duhalde rallied the support of
important provincial governors who play strong roles in Argentine
politics.</TE>
<TE>   "The critical situation that the nation is in made all the politicians
be aware that no one person or party can lead us out of it," said Luis
Obarrio, a Peronist deputy from Buenos Aires.</TE>
<TE>   In an address to the nation late Tuesday, Duhalde said he will do away
with the economic and political models he said had brought the country to
the brink of ruin, destroying the middle class. He invoked the names of
Juan and Evita Peron, populist leaders of the past, in promising
Argentines a new start.</TE>
<TE>   Although Duhalde did not specify any new measures, financial markets
took him to mean that he will abandon the regime that matched the peso to
the dollar, which has made Argentine goods noncompetitive at home and
abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Although exchange houses have officially been closed since Fernando de
la Rua's resignation in a bid by the government to squelch demand for
dollars, the few money changers doing business here Wednesday took the
hint and were offering between 1.4 and 1.5 pesos to the dollar, in
anticipation of a devaluation of 40% to 50%. Officially, the peso has
traded on a one-to-one basis to the dollar since 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Argentines are also waiting to see whether Duhalde proposes a
conversion of the dollar-denominated debts and contracts that dominate
the economy, encompassing everything from mortgages to cable bills.
Without such an offsetting adjustment, a devaluation would cause a wave
of bankruptcies and foreclosures because many Argentines would be unable
to meet their obligations.</TE>
<TE>   "Without an adjustment [to debts] in the same percentage as a
devaluation, there will be no social justice and we will all be
destroyed. Peronism is first and foremost about social justice," said
Manuel Fernandez, a businessman from a Buenos Aires suburb who was one of
several hundred people demonstrating in front of the presidential palace
Wednesday in favor of Duhalde.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde's economic package will probably include a reaffirmation of
Rodriguez's vow to default on Argentina's $132 billion in foreign debt.
But whereas Rodriguez promised to use the savings to fund 1 million
public works jobs, Duhalde said he supports unspecified government aid to
the unemployed.</TE>
<TE>   The new president, who is to serve out the remainder of De la Rua's
term ending Dec. 10, 2003, may also impose taxes on imports and exports
in a bid to raise revenue for coffers depleted by a 33% reduction in tax
collections nationwide in December, said Abel Viglione, an economist at
the Fiel economic think tank in Buenos Aires.</TE>
<TE>   The tax revenue drop was even greater--47%--in the capital, where
one-quarter of the nation's economy is generated. Argentines' refusal to
pay taxes amounts to a massive bet on the likelihood of a devaluation: By
waiting a few days or weeks to pay, their hoarded dollars will be worth
more in peso terms, making peso-denominated taxes cheaper.</TE>
<TE>   That's sound thinking, say economists, who expect Duhalde to introduce
either a free-floating peso or, more likely, a "crawling peg," in which
the government would support a new exchange rate starting at about 1.4
pesos to the dollar but allowing it to gradually devalue further over
time, much like Brazil's currency before it went to a floating system in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina can't go to a free-floating currency immediately because it
might lose as much as two-thirds of its value, Viglione said.</TE>

<LD>Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called on all
branches of government to work together, an apparent reference to the
growing rift between the hard-line judiciary and reformist-dominated
parliament over the jailing of lawmakers.</LD>
<LD>   Reformist lawmakers, supporters of President Mohammad Khatami's drive
for more freedoms, appealed to Khamenei last week to stop the hard-line
courts and security apparatus from prosecuting and jailing their
colleagues.</LD>
<LD>   Khamenei did not comment directly on the crisis. He appeared to be
seeking a balance in the government even though he has sided mostly with
hard-liners in the past.</LD>

<HD>Peru Begins to Bury 274 Fire Victims</HD>

<DL>LIMA, Peru
</DL>
<LD>Dozens of coffins were stacked up outside Lima's morgue Wednesday
as officials began to bury victims of Saturday's huge fire, even though
many have not been identified.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said 274 people died in the blaze, down from the earlier
official count of 290. Of those, 210 were burned beyond recognition,
along with their driver's licenses and other forms of identification.</LD>
<LD>   They will be buried in graves marked by a number and the inscription
"NN," meaning unidentified, said Doris Sanchez, the Cabinet minister in
charge of women's issues.</LD>
<TE>   The blaze erupted Saturday night in a downtown Lima district packed
with holiday shoppers and sidewalk vendors. Officials believe a large
firecracker, lit on a street, ignited dozens of nearby fireworks stands.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze destroyed four blocks of tenements and shopping galleries in
less than five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Peruvians use fireworks to celebrate not only New Year's and Christmas
but a host of other holidays and festivals.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez said the burials were being expedited because the morgue did
not have enough refrigerated chambers to hold all the bodies. Workers put
on masks Wednesday as they wheeled coffins to hearses.</TE>
<TE>   The government has said it will use DNA analysis to identify all the
bodies, a process that could take a few months. Records from dental care,
a luxury in Peru, were not available for most of the victims.</TE>

<DL>SYDNEY, Australia
</DL>
<LD>As blazes continued raging around Australia's largest city and
thousands fled their homes today, police discovered the remains of what
might have been two homemade bombs used by arsonists to set tinder-dry
forests afire.</LD>
<LD>   More than 100 bush fires burning out of control near Sydney and in its
suburbs were being fanned by hot, dry and swirling winds. Smoke clouds
towered above the city of 4 million people.</LD>
<LD>   At Sussex Inlet, a coastal hamlet about 120 miles south of Sydney,
about 5,000 residents and summer vacationers fled a massive firestorm
that engulfed as many as 12 homes and damaged others.</LD>
<TE>   That brought to almost 160 the number of houses lost since Christmas
Day.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters, mostly volunteers, waged a house-by-house battle to save
lives and property.</TE>
<TE>   New South Wales state Premier Bob Carr vowed to punish those "driven
by madness and wickedness" to start fires.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say at least half the wildfires have been deliberately
set, and police have arrested 21 suspects.</TE>
<TE>   As the hunt for more arsonists continued, police said they found the
pieces of what appeared to be incendiary devices at two charred bush
areas, including one where fierce flames threatened hundreds of homes,
just 11 miles from downtown Sydney.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Deputy Police Commissioner Ken Moroney said the device found
there was "capable of being ignited and causing substantial damage,"
national news agency Australian Associated Press reported. He declined to
elaborate.</TE>

<HD>Protein That Wards Off Cancer Also Affects Aging, Study Finds</HD>
<DH>Health: Chemical that protects rats in early years causes physical
deterioration later, evidence shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A critical protein that protects animals from cancer in their early
years appears, in later life, to cause much of the deterioration
associated with aging, according to a provocative new study.</LD>
<LD>   The results, by scientists at the Baylor College of Medicine in
Houston, "raise the shocking possibility that aging may be a side effect
of the natural safeguards that protect us from cancer," two commentators
say in an editorial accompanying the new study, which appears in Friday's
edition of the journal Nature.</LD>
<LD>   The research was done in mice, and its applicability to people is
uncertain. But mice and humans are close evolutionary relatives, and the
new study is likely to set off a race to clarify the exact relationship
between cancer biology and aging in human patients.</LD>
<TE>   Arnold Levine, president of New York's Rockefeller University and
co-discoverer of a vital protein involved in the body's defense against
cancer, called the new study "extraordinary." Bert Vogelstein, a top
cancer researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said the results are
"fascinating" and "surprising." He added: "Like all good research, it
raises a lot more questions than it answers."</TE>
<TE>Balancing Aging With Cancer Risk</TE>
<TE>   Among the questions is whether any attempt to slow down the overall
process of aging--to create an anti-aging pill--would be likely to raise
cancer rates. The Nature commentary says scientists working on aging now
have to take into account the prospect that "drug-related approaches to
interfere with this process may come at a price--the disruption of our
natural mechanisms for keeping cancer at bay."</TE>
<TE>   The research also raises the possibility that younger people treated
successfully for cancer with chemotherapy may be subject to premature
aging later in life, a possibility that has never been rigorously
examined. The Nature commentators, Gerardo Ferbeyre and Scott W. Lowe,
called for immediate study of this proposition.</TE>
<TE>   The new paper started with an apparent failure in the laboratory that
turned into a classic tale of scientific luck and alertness.</TE>
<TE>   Eight years ago, in the cancer lab of Lawrence Donehower at Baylor
College of Medicine, researchers were trying to create mice with a
weakened version of a protein called p53, which is a central cog in the
machinery that prevents cells from growing wildly out of control and
turning into tumors.</TE>
<TE>   The hope was that these mice would be susceptible to tumors similar to
those seen in human patients. But the techniques for manipulating genes
are still crude, and instead of making mice with weakened p53, Donehower
and colleagues accidentally made mice with a hyperactive version of the
protein.</TE>
<TE>   Exasperated, they figured the mice wouldn't do them much good in their
cancer work. "We sort of set the mice off in a corner of our mouse colony
and ignored them," Donehower said.</TE>
<TE>Offhand Comment 'Was Like a Lightbulb'</TE>
<TE>   Even ordinary mice are fairly prone to developing tumors, and the
researchers noticed as time went by that virtually none of the mutant
mice were getting them. That alone was not so surprising, since p53 is
such an effective tumor suppressor--up to now, in fact, that was thought
to be its primary role in biology.</TE>
<TE>   But as time went on, the tumor-free mice looked weirder and weirder.
"I couldn't quite figure out what it was until my lab technician, Ben
Cooper, said the words, 'These mice just look old,' " Donehower recalled.
"That was like a lightbulb."</TE>
<TE>   A young graduate student, Stuart Tyner, latched onto the project. "I
felt like this was kind of a gold mine," he said. He subjected the mutant
mice to a battery of tests that confirmed what was already becoming
obvious to the naked eye: They were fading fast.</TE>
<TE>   At an age when normal mice are still fairly vigorous, the bones of the
mutant mice became brittle and porous, and they developed hunchbacks.
Their hair thinned. Their muscles and other body parts shrank. They lost
weight. They recovered poorly from wounds and other stresses. When a few
were given a standard anesthetic at doses that don't hurt normal mice,
the mutant mice keeled over, dead.</TE>
<TE>   Even though virtually none of them came down with cancers, they died,
on average, at 96 weeks, compared with 118 weeks for normal mice. Their
enhanced cancer resistance was accompanied, in other words, by a 20% drop
in life span.</TE>
<TE>   "The major impact of the study is that it more tightly links tumor
suppression and aging," Donehower said. "It really surprised us."</TE>
<TE>Detailed Evidence of Protein's Importance</TE>
<TE>   The work confirms hints that had already been emerging in scientific
literature in recent years that p53 and related proteins might play an
important role in aging, but the new paper is far more detailed--and,
scientists say, more compelling--than anything published to date.</TE>
<TE>   By the standards of a protein, p53 was already a focus of intense
study, and the new paper raises the possibility that it is a prime
mechanism in not one but two of the most important aspects of human
biology.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Donehower paper makes an enormous contribution," said
Levine, the Rockefeller president. "It's not that everyone knows it's
right yet or that there aren't other lines of evidence that are
important, but it's conceptually extraordinary."</TE>
<TE>   The paper adds weight to the developing hypothesis that the body has
to walk a line between cancer protection and aging, that they are in
effect two sides of a coin. "You have a fine balance," Donehower said.
"Too much p53 and you get this aging effect, too little and you get
cancer. My guess is that evolution has evolved just the right level."</TE>
<TE>   A great deal of work remains to confirm Donehower's findings, and the
paper is likely to open new fields of inquiry. One immediate question is
the effect in younger people of chemotherapy drugs, which attack cancer
by deliberately damaging DNA, the genetic material.</TE>
<TE>   These drugs are already known to have many deleterious effects. If
they activate p53 by causing genetic damage in healthy cells, could that
eventually accelerate aging, even in patients who took the drugs decades
ago?</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the work raises the question of whether it will be possible
to manipulate aging at all.</TE>

<HD>Bush Eases Limits on Supercomputer Exports</HD>
<DH>Trade: The move will allow some nations, including Russia and
China, to import more powerful U.S. machines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In a move that pits national security concerns against commercial
interests, President Bush on Wednesday eased restrictions on the export
of supercomputers to Russia, China, Pakistan and other nations.</LD>
<LD>   Bush notified congressional leaders that his administration will more
than double the amount of computing power allowed to be exported to "tier
3" nations, a group of more than three dozen countries that pose nuclear
proliferation concerns, including Israel and India.</LD>
<LD>   The decision marks the second time computer export restrictions have
been eased since 1999 and comes amid heightened national security
concerns after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and World
Trade Center. It also comes nearly a month after Bush vowed to "toughen
export controls."</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. restricts the sale of the nation's most powerful computing
technology in an effort to thwart the spread of nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Under the relaxed standards approved by Bush, the government will
restrict the export of computers that perform more than 190,000 MTOPS
(millions of theoretical operations per second), more than double the
current limit of 85,000 MTOPS. A computer that uses 36 Pentium 4
processors--new home computers can run on just one of those
processors--could theoretically crank out about 191,988 MTOPS, according
to Intel Corp., which makes the Pentium processors.</TE>
<TE>   The widespread availability of such powerful processors led some
experts to say that it is futile to try to restrict supercomputers.</TE>
<TE>   "Moore's Law has not been repealed," said John Pike, director of the
Alexandria, Va., consulting firm Globalsecurity.org, referring to the
industry maxim that computer power inexorably doubles every 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   The White House conceded as much Wednesday when it announced the
policy change.</TE>
<TE>   "These reforms are needed due to the rapid rate of technological
change in the computer industry. Single microprocessors available today,
by mail order and the Internet, perform at more than 25 times the speed
of supercomputers built in the early 1990s," said White House Deputy
Press Secretary Scott McClellan.</TE>
<TE>   However, McClellan said the changes "will advance the president's goal
of updating the U.S. export control system so it protects U.S. national
security and, at the same time, allows America's high-tech companies to
innovate and successfully compete in today's marketplace."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the Export Administration Act, the computer regulations
were approved during the Cold War era, when most computers were much less
powerful. The act expired in 1990 but has been given temporary extensions
by Congress.</TE>
<TE>   But even hard-line security hawks say containing the spread of more
powerful computers to wayward nations may be all but impossible in this
era of global commerce and cheaper and faster microprocessors.</TE>
<TE>   "In the long run, trying to prevent the spread of computation
capability is like trying to prevent the spread of knowledge; however,
you don't want the most advanced machines going to the bad guys," said
Henry D. Sokolski, director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education
Center, a conservative Washington group.</TE>
<TE>   Critics note that the first nuclear weapons were created in the 1940s
without the use of powerful computer technology. But Sokolski said
supercomputers can be instrumental in shortening the engineering time
needed to develop advanced nuclear triggers.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you need the most advanced computer to solve tough problems? No,
but anything that increases computing capability increases the ability to
solve complex problems more quickly," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The computer chip industry has lobbied intensively for an end to the
export limits. This latest easing was applauded by industry leader Intel,
which is preparing to roll out its next-generation processor, the
Itanium.</TE>
<TE>   "We are pleased and gratified that the administration has chosen to
move the limit up," said Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy. "It will allow us
to continue to export [freely] for the next two years or so." But Mulloy
said the industry will continue to lobby for an end to the restriction
because the next generation of processors will probably require another
adjustment within two years.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's move met resistance from some within the administration,
industry lobbyists said.</TE>
<TE>   It comes less than a month after Bush cited a need for tougher export
controls. "Together, we must keep the world's most dangerous technologies
out of the hands of the world's most dangerous people," Bush said Dec. 11
in a speech to cadets at the Citadel, a military college in South
Carolina.</TE>

<HD>Puerto Rico Loses Lawsuit Over Vieques</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit Wednesday that had been filed
by Puerto Rico seeking to block further U.S. Navy bombing exercises on
the island of Vieques.</LD>
<LD>   The military's use of the small Caribbean island to test weapons and
train troops has caused a long-running dispute between activists who say
it damages the health, safety and welfare of nearby residents and
military officials who say the training area is vital.</LD>
<LD>   In the suit dismissed in Washington by U.S. District Judge Gladys
Kessler, Puerto Rican officials argued that the firing of naval guns on
the island violated federal noise control regulations and a local statute
passed in April.</LD>
<TE>   Kessler, in her decision, noted that the "political and policy issues
raised in this case are complex and involve the clash of many important
issues." But, she said, the federal Noise Control Act did not permit
Puerto Rico to sue in federal district court for the alleged violations.</TE>
<TE>   Puerto Rican officials said they plan to appeal. The suit alleges that
the noise created by the firing ranges has led to "fear, anxiety and
tension" for residents and has particularly traumatized children. About
9,300 people live on the small island southeast of Puerto Rico. The U.S.
military has denied that the exercises have caused any ill effects.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush said in June that he believed the training site should
be phased out by May 2003, a position that was controversial in the
military and on Capitol Hill even before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
and the war in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   A binding referendum allowing Vieques residents to vote on whether
military exercises should end by 2003 was scheduled for November but was
postponed by the Navy and then revoked by Congress as part of legislation
for defense spending.</TE>
<TE>   Those who have followed the issue closely say the referendum had been
considered one of the best chances to ensure that Bush's 2003 deadline
was enforced. As it stands now, legislation passed by Congress says that
date will be met only if a suitable replacement site can be found for the
training exercises.</TE>

<LD>Children conceived artificially after the father's death have the

ruled unanimously.</LD>
<LD>   "Posthumously conceived children may not come into the world the way
the majority of children do. But they are children nonetheless," Chief
Justice Margaret Marshall wrote.</LD>
<LD>   For inheritance rights, the mother must prove a genetic relationship
between the father and child and establish that the father consented to
posthumous conception and agreed to support his child, the Supreme
Judicial Court ruled.</LD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A novice crime writer jailed in Houston since July for withholding
notes from a grand jury has asked the Supreme Court to intervene.</LD>
<LD>   Vanessa Leggett wants the court to use her case to give writers and
reporters more rights to protect the confidentiality of their sources.
She has refused to hand over all of her research for a book about the
shooting death of a Texas socialite to a grand jury investigating the
victim's husband.</LD>
<LD>   Leggett asked the Supreme Court this week to overturn the U.S. 5th
Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling that a judge acted properly in jailing
her for contempt.</LD>

<LD>Miami run offense vs. Nebraska run defense</LD>
<LD>  At tailback, the Hurricanes have Clinton Portis, who gained 1,200
yards. At fullback, the Hurricanes have a question mark with freshman
Willis McGahee filling in for injured starter Najeh Davenport. The
Cornhuskers give up 116.9 rushing yards a game, which ranks 22nd
nationally. Nebraska has held half of its opponents to fewer than 70
yards rushing. In its last game, however, the Cornhuskers gave up 380
rushing yards against Colorado.</LD>
<TE>Miami pass offense vs. Nebraska pass defense</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes stress balance on offense, having averaged 250.2 yards
a game passing and 204.6 rushing. With the ball in the hands of
quarterback Ken Dorsey (a school-record 58 touchdown passes in two
seasons, including 23 this season) and the threat of the run ever
present, Nebraska will have trouble grounding this high-flying attack.
All-American cornerback Keyuo Craver leads a Nebraska unit that led the
nation in opponents' completion percentage at 43.3%. The Cornhuskers give
up 170.2 passing yards a game, have 19 interceptions and have given up
only eight touchdown passes. Nebraska has 39 sacks.</TE>
<TE>Nebraska run offense vs. Miami run defense</TE>
<TE>   Heisman Trophy winner Eric Crouch is at the controls of the
Cornhuskers' option attack. Burly I-back Dahrran Diedrick led the Big 12
Conference with 1,299 yards and Crouch rushed for 1,115, giving Nebraska
two 1,000-yard rushers for the first time since 1997. Thunder Collins,
who has gained 647 yards, is more of a slashing-type runner for the
Cornhuskers and can also catch a pass. The Cornhuskers led the nation in
rushing at 314.7 yards a game. Shutting down the option is never easy,
but the Hurricanes had a difficult time against Virginia Tech, which ran
the option only 10 times against Miami. The Hokies gained over 100 yards
with it and lost by only two points.</TE>
<TE>Nebraska pass offense vs. Miami pass defense</TE>
<TE>  Crouch is regarded mainly as a running threat, but he has passed for
1,510 yards and seven touchdowns while completing 55.6% of his passes.
Receiver Wilson Thomas has a team-best 37 receptions for 616 yards and
three touchdowns. Tight end Tracey Wistrom has 21 catches for 323 yards
and two touchdowns. Led by safety Edward Reed, who led the nation with
nine interceptions, the Hurricanes had the No. 2 pass defense, giving up
138.2 yards a game. Miami's defense has exceptional speed, which it will
need to keep up with Crouch.</TE>
<TE>Special teams</TE>
<TE>  With 10 touchdowns and 72 points, the Hurricanes led the nation for the
second consecutive season in non-offensive scoring, special teams sharing
the credit with the defense. If it comes down to kicking, Miami has Todd
Sievers, whose 21 field goals and 119 points are school single-season
records. Nebraska kicker Josh Brown has made 10 of 14 field-goal
attempts, including nine of his last 11, and is 34 of 37 on extra-point
attempts. Nebraska punter Kyle Larson ranks 29th nationally, averaging
42.5 yards a kick. Nebraska has blocked two field-goal attempts and two
punts. The Cornhuskers gave up an 85-yard punt return for a touchdown
against Texas Tech, but that is the only punt return of more than 25
yards. Josh Davis averages 27 yards a kickoff return and DeJuan Groce
averages 14.21 yards a punt return.</TE>
<TE>Coaching</TE>
<TE>  The easygoing manner of Larry Coker, considered a players' coach, would
shock Bear Bryant or Woody Hayes. But then so would the idea of a
53-year-old rookie head coach going unbeaten and winning a national
title. Nebraska's Frank Solich is completing his fourth season as head
coach and is 42-8 since succeeding Tom Osborne after the Cornhuskers won
a share of their fifth national title by defeating Tennessee in the 1998
Orange Bowl. Solich, who calls the plays as the offensive coordinator, is
in his 23rd season on the Nebraska staff and has been a part of three
national championships.</TE>
<TE>Intangibles</TE>
<TE>   Those collective smiles on the faces of the favored Hurricanes will
fade quickly if Nebraska takes an early lead. There is pressure on the
Cornhuskers, who aren't supposed to be here. But there's even more
pressure on the Hurricanes, who aren't supposed to lose. The Cornhuskers
are in unusual position of being the underdog after losing regular-season
finale to Colorado, 62-36. After weeks of answering embarrassing
questions about their right to be playing in the bowl championship series
national championship game, Nebraska is motivated to knock off unbeaten
Miami and prove naysayers wrong.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget that the BCS is a royal mess, that Nebraska probably doesn't
belong in the game or that a Nebraska win will give Oregon a share of the
national title. The team from South Florida is about to make all of this
fuss Miami Moot. If you believe Miami is Oregon with better athletes,
what chance does Nebraska stand? Colorado beat Nebraska by 26 points and
lost to Oregon by 22. It didn't take a genius to figure out how Oregon
won. Knowing Colorado was a one-dimensional running team, the Duck
cornerbacks locked up the opposing receivers and committed forces to
stuffing the run. Miami will use the same concept to stop Nebraska. If
Crouch is going to beat Nebraska, it will have to be with his arm, not
his legs. And, for the record, Crouch has only seven touchdown passes
against 10 interceptions.</LD>
<LD>   Miami claims the championship outright and Oregon continues the rant
that it would have given Miami a better game. Score: Miami, 34-20</LD>

<HD>Popular U.S. Web Sites Remain Shut</HD>
<DH>Access: Judge's order hurts tourists, students, others who visit
Interior Department pages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SCHOCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The abrupt shutdown of Internet Web sites run by the U.S.
Department of the Interior four weeks ago has left Americans in the dark
about activities on millions of acres of federal lands, national parks
and monuments.</LD>
<LD>   Public access has been barred to government Web sites that once
allowed people to plan camping trips in Yosemite National Park, do
research on endangered wildlife, track controversial gas drilling in the
Rocky Mountains or even use online links to purchase tickets to Alcatraz
or check the visiting hours at New York's Ellis Island.</LD>
<LD>   The shutdown stems from a long-running case involving alleged
mismanagement of money held in trust for Indian tribes. The presiding
judge ordered the closure of Interior Department Web sites, which he
found to be vulnerable to hacking.</LD>
<TE>   Now, tourists seeking the popular National Park Service Web site,
which typically gets 700,000 hits a day, are greeted with an apologetic
note that operations are suspended "due to conditions outside our
department." High school students writing papers about America's most
endangered wildlife aren't able to view the U.S. Fish and Wildlife site,
which is full of colorful photos and statistics about imperiled birds,
foxes and butterflies.</TE>
<TE>   The shutdown is a dramatic illustration of how dependent the public
has become on government Web sites for everything from national park road
conditions to proposals for mining and oil and gas drilling.</TE>
<TE>   It is provoking growing concern among environmentalists who fear that
the loss of the Internet connection is blocking public access to
important data about upcoming decisions on land overseen by Interior
agencies such as the Park Service and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a fairness issue at stake," said Susan Daggett, managing
attorney with the Denver office of Earthjustice, a public interest law
firm.</TE>
<TE>   In Wyoming, the Bureau of Land Management plans to issue a massive
draft environmental review Jan. 11, scrutinizing 50,000 proposed oil and
gas wells in the Powder River Basin, a sage-specked prairie sliced by
deep canyons that is home to pronghorn antelope, mule deer and other
wildlife. The study is the largest ever conducted in Wyoming of coal-bed
methane extraction, a much-contested process that can displace and
pollute enormous quantities of water.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the BLM Web site is reopened soon, interested citizens will
have to call and request paper copies of the review document. And while
many environmental groups are on the agency's mailing lists, many private
citizens are not, said Tom Darrin, staff attorney at the Wyoming Outdoor
Council, a nonprofit environmental group.</TE>
<TE>   BLM Wyoming spokesman Beverly Gorny countered that her agency is
working hard to notify the public of important deadlines and reviews,
issuing media releases and contacting interested parties.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, some energy companies worry that their requests for
drilling permits may get lost in the shuffle at the bureau, which often
charts such applications electronically.</TE>
<TE>   "When some of our companies are calling [BLM] to ask where their
permit is in the process, they can't be told," said Bob Gallagher,
president of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Assn. "It is absolutely hurting
our ability to produce oil and gas."</TE>
<TE>   The closure of the Interior Department's Web sites has garnered little
attention, especially after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks prompted the
closing or editing of many federal government sites to keep sensitive
information secure.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of the Interior shutdown, however, is not an
anti-terrorist move. It grows out of an ongoing lawsuit claiming that the
federal government is mishandling Indian trust fund accounts overseen by
the department.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Court Judge Royce C. Lambeth on Dec. 5 ordered the
department to "immediately disconnect from the Internet all information
technology systems that house or provide access to Indian trust data" as
well as "all computers within the custody and control of the Department
of the Interior, its employees and contractors, that have access to
individual Indian trust data."</TE>
<TE>   The department has since been able to activate the site of the U.S.
Geological Survey, which carries weather and earthquake information, as
well as part of a national fire center site. But officials cannot say how
soon all sites will be running again.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working as fast as we can. All of us are," said Eric Ruff, the
Interior Department's director of communications. The department has
hired an outside contractor to scrutinize the security of the sites.
Special "firewalls" and intrusion detectors may be added, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the complaints received by agency officials were those from two
Toronto college students bewildered when they could not read government
reports required for their final exam. The students telephoned National
Park Service spokesman David Barna asking him to call their professor and
confirm that the material was unavailable. Barna complied.</TE>
<TE>   Security experts said the department's security problems are probably
not being overblown.</TE>
<TE>   "It should come as no surprise," said Bruce Schneier, founder of
Counterpane Internet Security, based in Sunnyvale, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   For Interior employees, the order has turned the clock back five years
or more. Time cards are being processed on paper. Thick environmental
reviews must be faxed.</TE>
<TE>   Even employees' Internet access has been halted, leaving them unable
to view other agencies' sites, use a search engine or send e-mail to
colleagues in other agencies.</TE>

<HD>Julia Phillips, Producer Whose Book Scandalized Hollywood, Dies at
57</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNN SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Movie producer Julia Phillips, who made Hollywood history as the
first woman to win a best picture Oscar--for "The Sting" in 1973--and who
became the talk of the town almost 20 years later with her scandalous
autobiography "You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again," died Tuesday
at her West Hollywood home. She was 57.</LD>
<LD>   Family members said she had been diagnosed as having cancer in August.</LD>
<LD>   Colorful and sharp-tongued, Phillips was known as a creative player in
the freewheeling 1970s when young Hollywood filmmakers were gaining
clout. She won the Academy Award as co-producer of the blockbuster "The
Sting" and then co-produced Martin Scorsese's acclaimed "Taxi Driver" in
1976, followed by director Steven Spielberg's 1977 hit "Close Encounters
of the Third Kind."</LD>
<TE>   Her 1990 book helped redefine the nature of Hollywood autobiographies
with its insider's chronicle of petty indiscretions and vindictiveness
among the town's top echelons. Phillips not only named names, she also
offered sometimes harsh personal judgments of former friends in high
places in the movie business.</TE>
<TE>   In an image-conscious industry, Phillips' candor was not appreciated.
The book alienated many among the industry's elite--some of whom never
spoke to her again, at lunch or otherwise. Friends and family members
said she was stunned at the reaction to what she considered her honesty,
and spent much of her remaining life in retreat. Still, they said, she
would not have changed a word.</TE>
<TE>   "You always have to pay your dues," she once told a reporter. "I paid
them backward--starting at the top and going to the bottom."</TE>
<TE>   Her son-in-law Modi Wiczyk said Phillips based her life on a two-word
philosophy: "No rules." Though no one was off limits from her biting wit,
she was always hardest on herself, he said. She died as she lived, he
said: unrepentant and with no regrets.</TE>
<TE>   "She didn't know the power of her own words," her daughter Kate said.
"I think she was shocked that people would take things to heart and be so
offended. . . . Would it make her do anything differently? No."</TE>
<TE>   The daughter of Jewish intellectuals, Julia Miller grew up in New York
and Wisconsin. She graduated from Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts,
where she failed math and French but won prestigious awards for her
short-story writing. In 1965, she married investment banker Michael
Phillips; they had one child, Kate.</TE>
<TE>   After a career in magazine publishing, Phillips joined Paramount
Pictures in 1969 as its East Coast story editor. She headed Mirisch
Productions in New York, and later became creative executive for First
Artist Productions, a group of actors seeking greater creative control.</TE>
<TE>   Along with actor Tony Bill, Phillips and her husband went into
business for themselves to produce "Steelyard Blues." Later, Phillips
became president of her own company: Ruthless Productions in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The name of the firm attested more to her candor than any chicanery,
Bill said. "Her honesty was what set her apart," he said. "It was her
calling card and her Achilles' heel."</TE>
<TE>   Short, bright, stylish and profane, Phillips was a trailblazer in
Hollywood where women producers, directors and executives had found few
opportunities, said producer Roz Heller, a longtime friend. Like other
women, Phillips had to assert herself and inflate her ambition just to
avoid being trampled on, Heller said.</TE>
<TE>   "Taxi Driver" was just one of the unpopular projects they had to fight
to produce, Heller said. "We couldn't get the green light. I remember her
being enormously pregnant, wearing a circle dress, standing up and
saying, 'I'm going to drop this baby right now if we don't get this green
light.' The men got very nervous." The film won the Cannes Film Festival
Palme d'Or in 1976 and was a commercial hit.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Scorsese noted that Phillips worked with him
personally in post-production on "Taxi Driver" and, along with her
husband, helped the movie reach the screen as the filmmakers intended.
"She was a friend," he said, "and I am sad for her loss."</TE>
<TE>   Phillips had a visionary ability to identify talent, said Peter
Biskind, author of "Easy Riders, Raging Bulls," an account of Hollywood
in the 1970s. At their Malibu beach house, she and her husband lived
large, entertaining Scorsese and Spielberg, Brian de Palma, John Milius,
Paul Schrader, Peter Boyle and Richard Dreyfuss, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Ideas flowed as freely as mind-expanding drugs, and Phillips fit right
in, Biskind said. "Someone would throw an idea out; Julia would say you
ought to write that up."</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly preoccupied with drugs, Phillips came to grief over
producing "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" (1977) with Spielberg. "He
essentially kicked her off the movie," Biskind said. "It pretty much
ended her career."</TE>
<TE>   By the time she published "You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again,"
Phillips was ready to burn her bridges, friends said. In the book, she
castigated the duplicity, selfishness and bottom-line mentality of the
town and insulted Hollywood's power brokers by name. She captured the era
perfectly, as only an insider could, Biskind said.</TE>
<TE>   Many consider the time before corporate and conglomerate pressures
took over movie making to be a golden age of Hollywood, Biskind said.
"She was its Edith Wharton."</TE>
<TE>   Some complained that Phillips' book was mean-spirited, riddled with
inaccuracies, a thin effort to regain entry to the top echelons of
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   However, Phillips told People magazine: "I'm just being honest. I
didn't write the book to get back in the business. I had to accept the
fact that I wasn't in the business before I wrote the book." Nothing she
wrote was as mean as the people she wrote about, she said later.</TE>
<TE>   After reading about himself in the book, movie and recording industry
executive David Geffen released Phillips from a contract to work on a
movie version of Anne Rice's novel "Interview With the Vampire." Some old
friends never spoke to her again.</TE>
<TE>   Friends said she was surprisingly sensitive to the criticism. Ten
years later, they said, she was pondering whether to respond to negative
reviews that appeared on the amazon.com Web site.</TE>
<TE>   She spent the ensuing years dealing with financial troubles and
working on writing projects, including her sequel to "Lunch," "Driving
Under the Affluence," which was released in 1995 and poorly received.</TE>
<TE>   Fascinated with mischief making, Phillips co-wrote 2000's "The Drudge
Manifesto" with Matt Drudge, the controversial Internet political gossip
columnist. She also wrote an essay on powerful Hollywood lesbians for
Harper's Bazaar, she said in an interview, because she liked "any outlaw
group that makes themselves apparent."</TE>
<TE>   Friends said she disliked revisiting the past, and preferred thinking
about the future. "She loved youth," Drudge said. Phillips was well
versed in techno music and, until the last few years, attended clubs.
"She was a hipster to the end," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Friends debate whether Phillips was a victim of Hollywood or the cause
of her own troubles.</TE>
<TE>   "By the end, no one was speaking to her. It's probably not fair to say
it was all her doing, though probably a lot of it was," Drudge said. "She
was difficult, difficult in a way that she wouldn't take any [guff]. She
was angry with the club for cutting her off."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, her most memorable traits were optimism and
generosity, family and friends said. Her effervescence and generosity of
spirit defined her, daughter Kate said. "She was generous with her time,
with her words, with her ability to listen and to help financially. Even
when she was struggling with financial insolvency, she was lending her
friends money."</TE>
<TE>   As with the rest of her life, Phillips faced its conclusion eye to
eye, her family said. Even on her deathbed, Bill said she was lucid, in
control, acerbic and funny. He remembers his final image of her beside a
movie screen-sized window framing a panorama from Hollywood to Catalina
Island with a morphine drip control in one hand and a cigarette in the
other.</TE>
<TE>   Wiczyk said Phillips called people she hadn't spoken to in a decade.
"Not for a conciliation. It was just to say, 'You were important to me at
one point in time and, so, goodbye.' "</TE>
<TE>   Phillips and her husband divorced in the '70s. She is survived by her
daughter Kate Phillips and a brother, Matthew Miller of Connecticut.

<HD>A State of High Anxiety</HD>
<DH>Argentines are psyched out by a slew of national crises. That means
busy days for Buenos Aires' many analysts, on whose couches residents
sort out indignities and setbacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>Wounded in mind and spirit, they come to the offices of Mirta
Goldstein, a psychoanalyst of the old-fashioned stripe, the kind with a
couch in one corner of her office and the collected works of Sigmund
Freud in another.</LD>
<LD>   Her clients are well-educated Argentines suffering from the estres
(stress) brought on by the unraveling of their lives. "I'm afraid I'm
going to fall apart," a female patient tells her one afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   That morning, the client had been waiting in a seemingly endless line
of people at the bank, all trying to get their money out before the
country collapses. Four people cut in. A shouting match ensued. "They
called me a crazy woman," she tells Goldstein. Hours later, the insult
still leaves her unhinged--"una loca."</LD>
<TE>   The client wonders: Am I really losing my mind? It is a question
people ask again and again in a city that, even before its current
economic and social decline, was already one of the most psychoanalyzed
places on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as Argentines watch their political system degenerate into a game
of musical chairs for the presidency, with the peso almost certain to be
devalued soon, every day brings a new indignity and a new personal
setback to sort out on the couches and chairs of the 40,000
psychiatrists, psychologists and therapists who work here.</TE>
<TE>   Buenos Aires is said to have the highest proportion of analysts of any
city in the world. Many, like Goldstein, work in the elegant Palermo
district of tall apartment buildings and pleasant parks, a neighborhood
that is known locally and in travel guides as Villa Freud.</TE>
<TE>   "We Argentines have a certain vocation for personal reflection," says
Orlando D'Adamo, a psychology professor at the University of Belgrano
here and author of "The Ugly Argentine," a treatise on the Argentine
national identity.</TE>
<TE>   "Our national identity has been based on the idea that we are a rich
country, a country with opportunity," D'Adamo says. "Now, people have
stopped believing in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Listen to Argentines of any social class reflect on the crisis and you
will hear voices of anger, confusion and despair.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what's going to happen next, that's the worst thing,"
says Gaston Diaz, 33. University-educated in sociology, he now drives a
taxi for a living. "The sense of insecurity kills you. My wife wants us
to move to Uruguay. She has a sister there. The truth is that things are
very difficult for us here."</TE>
<TE>   In years past, Villa Freud sessions centered on the more routine
concerns of middle-class life: distant spouses, unresolved childhood
traumas, the anxieties of businesspeople driven by relentless ambition.</TE>
<TE>   Today, many of those same clients are stumbling in, shaken by frozen
bank accounts, their businesses teetering on the brink of bankruptcy.
They also live under a persistent fear of becoming victims of an
unrelenting crime wave of carjackings and home-invasion robberies.</TE>
<TE>   Their adult children might be leaving for Miami, Madrid or some other
distant locale.</TE>
<TE>   "People feel completely impotent in the face of their reality,"
Goldstein says. "This provokes a sense of humiliation and guilt. People
begin to feel an inner violence. They have more car accidents. They use
more prescription drugs. They have more psychosomatic illnesses."</TE>
<TE>   Signs of the country's slow psychic collapse are everywhere in Buenos
Aires. They invade even the most placid corners of this city, known as
the Paris of Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   Beggars drift into the cafes and trendy shops of the Recoleta
district--an unknown phenomenon until recently. Senior citizens launch
into tales of woe on the commuter trains to the suburbs--"Forgive me,
passengers, for interrupting your day. But my husband is at home,
suffering from cancer, and of course we can't afford the treatments."</TE>
<TE>   During his first week in Buenos Aires, an American journalist came
upon a body on the street in Villa Freud, an older woman in a nightdress
surrounded by a team of police officers and emergency workers. She had
just jumped from her fourth-floor balcony, a suicide.</TE>
<TE>   "She had tried once before, the poor woman," said one onlooker. "She
was sick."</TE>
<TE>   "No, no, it's because of the pensions," said another bystander. "How
can you expect people to live on what they give you? And then they cut
it. What an outrage!"</TE>
<TE>   The Argentine crisis has hit so swiftly and so thoroughly that it has
changed the way psychoanalysts work in Buenos Aires, which is one of a
handful of places outside Vienna where the ideas of Freud--considered
passe in some psychological circles--are still dominant.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't really have time to work on the more serious issues people
have, the underlying root cause of their problems, because all they can
do is talk about how everything is falling apart around them," says
Fernando Weissmann, another Villa Freud analyst.</TE>
<TE>   Freud placed heavy emphasis on childhood traumas and parental
relationships as the bases of most neurosis.</TE>
<TE>   But as Weissmann points out: "What sense does it make to talk about
your client's relationship with his younger brother when he doesn't have
any money and he's got bill collectors at the door?"</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are more than a few of Freud's disciples here who see in
the Viennese thinker's ideas a clue to the way in which the current
crisis is playing out in the collective, unconscious mind of the
Argentine people.</TE>
<TE>   For Andres Rascovsky, president of the Argentine Psychoanalytic Assn.,
the crisis strikes at the psyche as a series of betrayals and violations
by men whom Argentines see as father figures--namely, the politicians
running the country.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most sinister figures haunting the Argentine unconscious,
Rascovsky says, is former President Carlos Menem, who ran the country
until 1999. To many middle-class Argentines, he remains a symbol of
government corruption.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the figure of the perverse, malignant father," Rascovsky says.
"The father who seduces his child with sweet words."</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the spectrum is Fernando de la Rua, the recently
deposed president, who appears as a weak and absent parent who allows his
family and home to fall into ruin.</TE>
<TE>   "People are having dreams in which they return to an infantile world,"
Rascovsky says. "They have an enormous distrust in the adult. In their
dreams, they are facing some threat, some sort of collapse or avalanche."</TE>
<TE>   One of Rascovsky's clients, a man in his 50s, lost his business and
had to move in with his parents. Another, a successful entrepreneur, is
suffering from a recurring nightmare related to a trauma from his teenage
years.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years ago, in high school, the client was a leftist activist.
Many of his friends were put in prison, and the client himself was driven
into exile. He later returned to Argentina, started a business and became
quite wealthy. Then the economy started to collapse.</TE>
<TE>   In his nightmare, the client is being tortured with electric shocks,
just as his friends had been years ago. But the man performing the
torture is a pudgy, balding man whose face is unmistakable to any
Argentine--it is that of Domingo Cavallo, the former minister of finance.</TE>
<TE>   Once seen as a national savior for ending Argentina's hyper-inflation,
Cavallo is the man most blamed by Argentines for their current plight.</TE>
<TE>   "People have lost faith in ideas and in leaders," Rascovsky says.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with the country's crisis taking on ever deeper and stranger
dimensions, people have sunk even lower into despair.</TE>
<TE>   For Carola Rubiani, 31, the daily struggle to keep her husband's
restaurant afloat has become an all-consuming concern.</TE>
<TE>   "Since the end of October, he hasn't served more than 30 meals in a
single day," she says. "I'm sure he's going to have to close it. What
will we live from? I go to bed at night worrying about how we're going to
keep on going, what sort of life we'll give to our children."</TE>
<TE>   With so many people suffering deep sadness, and with their services
needed more than ever, more than a few of the capital's psychologists and
analysts are facing a quandary: what to do when their clients can't pay.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge ethical question," says Goldstein, who also works as a
volunteer therapist at a local church. "How long do you keep on treating
them? We've got bills to pay too."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Seeks Custody of Taliban Leader</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Omar is reported to be in a west-central region and
negotiating a surrender.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>With intelligence reports zeroing in on Mullah Mohammed Omar's
suspected location and suggesting that he may be negotiating a surrender,
Pentagon officials warned Afghan allies Wednesday that they expect any
deal to put the Taliban leader in U.S. hands.</LD>
<LD>   As a Pentagon official declared Osama bin Laden's trail cold in the
snowcapped mountains of Tora Bora in eastern Afghanistan, U.S. forces and
Afghan allies focused on reports that America's second-most-wanted man is
entrenched with Taliban forces in the mountains around Baghran in
west-central Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Rear Adm. John D. Stufflebeem, deputy director of operations for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said U.S. special operations soldiers are "on the
hunt" for Omar and his Taliban holdouts, and Afghan commander Jamal Khan
said Afghan military leaders have been negotiating with people loyal to
Omar for two days.</LD>
<TE>   Still chafing from a previous surrender of Taliban troops that allowed
Omar to escape his southern stronghold of Kandahar, Pentagon officials
have pressured Afghan leaders not to let that happen again.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been made very clear that we expect to have control of him,"
Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said of Omar. "From what we have
seen from reports from the interim government, from anti-Taliban forces,
they understand and have said, 'We understand that if we come [into]
control of Omar, he will be turned over to the United States.' "</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and Afghan anti-Taliban interests have diverged more than once,
creating a yawning gap in trust. In Kandahar in early December, local
commanders who were mostly interested in controlling the city had said
they had crafted a deal that would put Omar in their custody. Instead, he
and hundreds, if not thousands, of pro-Taliban fighters melted into the
countryside.</TE>
<TE>   Some Pentagon officials think that ethnic Pushtuns agreed to look the
other way while fellow Pushtuns escaped. In Tora Bora, U.S. officials
have had trouble persuading Afghan allies to continue searching caves
vacated by members of Bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   The consistency of reports on Omar's whereabouts contrasted sharply
with waning confidence in intelligence on the location of Bin Laden, whom
the U.S. blames for the Sept. 11 attacks on the Pentagon and the World
Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he's up there" in Tora Bora, Col. John Mulholland, the
commander of the Joint Special Operations Task Force, told reporters
Wednesday at a Special Forces base near Afghanistan. "I do think he's
either dead, buried under some tonnage of rock or he's out of there."</TE>
<TE>   Reporters agreed not to disclose the base's exact location because the
host nation's leaders want to keep their war contribution secret.</TE>
<TE>   Omar is an easier target to track, defense officials said. The
fugitive Taliban leader has reportedly never traveled beyond Pakistan and
is believed to have strong ties only to tribal leaders in that country.
The comparatively cosmopolitan Bin Laden, son of a Saudi construction
magnate, has spent time in Yemen and Sudan and traveled considerably.</TE>
<TE>   "Omar is a homeboy," said retired Lt. Col. Ralph Peters, a former Army
intelligence official. "He's not going to fit in much anywhere else. He's
going to be tied in with specific tribal networks. He can't simply pop up
in Yemen and blend in, whereas Osama bin Laden has been a globe-trotter
for quite a while."</TE>
<TE>   Reports consistently put Omar in the mountains of Helmand province,
but Stufflebeem said that "there is not a preponderance of reports that
would allow us to pinpoint a location" within that region. Stufflebeem
said he doubts reports that Bin Laden had joined Omar.</TE>
<TE>   The differing reports on the whereabouts of the two men stem from
having a variety of human sources, varied analyses of their reports and
spotty U.S. intelligence, defense officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "People talk about the fog of war. There's a fog of peace as well--or
the not war/not peace we have now in Afghanistan," Peters said. "There's
a great deal of honest confusion."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, he added, "no matter how good your systems, how good your
skills, what usually brings an individual down is a lucky break--a bit of
information or an informant."</TE>
<TE>   Although the top leaders have eluded anti-Taliban forces, an airstrike
last week reportedly succeeded in killing the Taliban's intelligence
chief, Qari Ahmadulla. The BBC Pashto-language radio service reported
Wednesday that Ahmadulla, his brother and two colleagues were killed in
one of two U.S. airstrikes Dec. 26 and Friday, citing accounts from
Afghans fleeing the country for Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   As American forces continue the manhunt, searches of abandoned caves
in Tora Bora and elsewhere have yielded documents and equipment that U.S.
officials hope will shed light on the Al Qaeda network, its capabilities
and its future targets. About 200 Marines doing intelligence-gathering
northwest of Kandahar found papers and small arms in the early hours of
Tuesday, according to the U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Fla., which is
directing the war.</TE>
<TE>   Another group of troops recovered the Air Force Global Hawk unmanned
aerial vehicle that crashed Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The number of pro-Taliban soldiers in U.S. custody has increased to
221, the Pentagon reported Wednesday. Two hundred are in Kandahar, 12 at
Bagram air base north of the capital, Kabul, one in the northern city of
Mazar-i-Sharif and eight aboard the amphibious assault ship Bataan.</TE>
<TE>   Those detainees aboard the Bataan, including American Talib John
Walker Lindh, were transferred this week from the amphibious assault ship
Peleliu, which is apparently preparing to leave the region. The 15th
Marine Expeditionary Unit is vacating an air base near Kandahar and will
begin boarding the Peleliu "for further operations," Stufflebeem said.
The Marines will be replaced by soldiers from the Army's 101st Airborne
Division.</TE>
<TE>   In Kabul, interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai met with the Iranian
envoy to Afghanistan and won a commitment for the construction of a
railway line between the Iranian city of Mashhad and Herat, the largest
city in western Afghanistan. Iran also offered to pay the salaries of
professors at Kabul University, who, like other government employees,
have not been paid in months.</TE>
<TE>   The German government pledged to help Afghanistan improve and expand
its urban bus system, which is overcrowded and in disrepair.</TE>
<TE>   Near Kandahar, a U.S. special operations soldier suffered first- and
second-degree burns on his face and hands during demolition training
Tuesday. His injuries were not considered life-threatening.</TE>

<HD>Moussaoui Enters Plea of Not Guilty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.
</DL>
<LD>Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person charged in the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, pleaded not guilty Wednesday, setting in motion a
prolonged and high-profile legal battle that will also put Osama bin
Laden's terrorism network on trial before a global audience.</LD>
<LD>   The case confronts a range of unusual legal issues, including what
constitutes terrorism and how the legal system should balance the
nation's security interests against a defendant's right to know the
evidence against him.</LD>
<LD>   "I think what the American people are going to see is a closely fought
case, the outcome of which is genuinely in doubt, involving an issue that
is one of the most important issues of our time," said Ronald Kuby, a
prominent defense lawyer.</LD>
<TE>   Moussaoui, 33, a French citizen of Moroccan descent, will be tried in
U.S. District Court on six counts of conspiring with Bin Laden, 19 men
identified as the hijackers and others to murder thousands of people in
the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. If convicted, he
faces the death penalty on any one of four of those counts, and life in
prison on each of the other two.</TE>
<TE>   "In the name of Allah, I do not have anything to plead," Moussaoui,
speaking in heavily accented English, said in the Alexandria courtroom.
"I enter no plea. Thank you very much."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said she understood Moussaoui's
statement to be a plea of not guilty. After Moussaoui's defense attorney,
Frank Dunham, agreed, Brinkema set an Oct. 14 trial date for the case.</TE>
<TE>   Her decision was made over defense attorneys' objections that nine
months is not enough time to prepare for such a complex case. They also
argued that it will come too close to the one-year anniversary of the
attacks in New York and at the Pentagon, which is less than two miles
from the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Brinkema also gave prosecutors until March 29 to say whether they
intend to seek the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>Trial Expected to Draw Worldwide Audience</TE>
<TE>   Some legal experts predict that the case could become for terrorism
what the O.J. Simpson case was for murder: an almost forensic dissection
of all aspects of the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Court TV has petitioned Brinkema to televise the trial. But even if
that request is rejected, Wednesday's brief arraignment offered proof
that an international contingent of journalists will be hanging on every
development and broadcasting them worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Kuby said the trial will showcase the benefits of a public criminal
proceeding as opposed to a military tribunal.</TE>
<TE>   "There are very experienced teams of lawyers on both sides, you have a
court that has already shown it will provide sufficient resources to the
defense to mount a good defense and you will have the whole world
watching," said Kuby, who has defended terrorists in several high-profile
cases, including some ultimately convicted in the 1993 plot to blow up
New York City landmarks.</TE>
<TE>   According to the government's lengthy indictment, prosecutors will
attempt to prove that Moussaoui was not only a co-conspirator in the
Sept. 11 attacks but also an active member of Bin Laden's Al Qaeda
network.</TE>
<TE>   And it is those conspiracy charges that could make the trial so
provocative and the daily developments so unpredictable, legal experts
said.</TE>
<TE>   In cases involving national security, the defendant often does not
know all of the evidence against him because the government can claim
that it is classified information and releasing it would jeopardize
national security.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, in federal court, prosecutors can withhold surprise
witnesses until the last minute. Because Moussaoui is being charged as a
conspirator instead of a direct participant, much could be left to
interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a series of facts that can easily be rearranged by the
government and the defense to present entirely different pictures [of
Moussaoui] to the jurors," said Jonathan Turley, a constitutional law
professor at George Washington University Law School who specializes in
national security cases.</TE>
<TE>   Turley described the Moussaoui indictment as "a preliminary novel, in
a sense."</TE>
<TE>   "The most interesting people in that courtroom will be those people
who will not be present," such as Bin Laden, Turley said. "That is
precisely why a conspiracy case like this is so interesting: Both sides
are not tethered to any factual foundation. They have these rich and
sinister characters who will be omnipresent, but not present, at the
trial. And both sides may [use] these characters to their advantage."</TE>
<TE>Security Tight as Moussaoui Appears</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui entered his plea in a packed courtroom ringed by heavy
security. As was the case in a previous appearance, he did not stand in
the judge's presence until prodded to do so by a bailiff.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in a blue-green prison jumpsuit and wearing shackles,
Moussaoui offered his remarks in a strong voice before slouching in his
chair for the rest of the half-hour proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui's mother, who had flown from France to be at her son's side
during the hearing, decided at the last minute not to attend, saying
through a lawyer that she did not want to draw attention away from the
proceedings. Later, in an emotional plea at Dulles International Airport,
Aicha el-Wafi asked prosecutors to spare her son's life if he is
convicted. And she repeated claims that he is innocent.</TE>
<TE>   "I refuse to have my son be a scapegoat for things he didn't do," she
said before boarding a flight home. She added that, in a letter that her
son mailed to her from jail, "he told me he didn't do anything."</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui was indicted last month and charged with conspiracy to
commit acts of terrorism, to commit aircraft piracy, to destroy aircraft,
to use weapons of mass destruction, to murder U.S. employees and to
destroy property.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. authorities have suggested that Moussaoui, who had a history of
Islamic militancy in Europe, may have been preparing to be the 20th
hijacker, joining one of four teams that launched the worst terrorist
attacks in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   They say the jetliner that crashed into a Pennsylvania field had only
four hijackers on board while the other three planes had five and that
Moussaoui was making similar preparations as the hijackers, including
seeking flight training and surveying Web sites on crop-dusting. But he
had been arrested and was detained on immigration charges when the
terrorists struck Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities also allege that Moussaoui spent part of 1998 in an Al
Qaeda terrorist training camp in Afghanistan and that he had connections
to another man implicated in the plot, Ramzi Binalshibh. They have not,
however, publicly offered any proof that Moussaoui knew any of the 19
hijackers or that he engaged in any planning with them.</TE>
<TE>Flight Lessons Had Raised Suspicions</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui was arrested in Minnesota in mid-August on immigration
violations after he aroused suspicion by trying to buy time on a jumbo
jet flight simulator at a flight school. He was later taken to New York
as a material witness in the case.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Moussaoui's defense lawyers said the October trial date
does not give them enough time to prepare, particularly given all of the
national security issues involved. Much of the government's case is
expected to come from classified documents and from law enforcement and
intelligence agencies in the U.S. and other countries.</TE>
<TE>   That will require the lawyers to get security clearances, defense
lawyer Gerald Zerkin argued. He and other lawyers suggested it would be
hard to get an impartial jury: the district is known for its conservative
judges and juries.</TE>
<TE>   Brinkema said she believes an "excellent jury" can be assembled from
the suburban communities near the courthouse. And she said the government
will issue the necessary security clearances quickly.</TE>

<HD>New Deficits to Force Boost of Debt Ceiling</HD>
<DH>Economy: Treasury urges Congress to raise the federal borrowing
limit quickly. Debate on first increase since 1997 will foreshadow
battles over 2003 budget and tax cuts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Only four years after celebrating the end of chronic deficit
spending, Congress soon will be forced once again to raise the federal
debt ceiling so that the government can keep operating.</LD>
<LD>   Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill has notified Congress that the
current $5.95-trillion debt ceiling could be breached as early as
February. He asked lawmakers to move quickly to raise the limit to $6.7
trillion.</LD>
<LD>   "Sure, it's a big deal. Instead of having latitude to do lots of
things, we're back to the old business of trying to balance our wishes
and our resources," said economist Susan Hering of UBS Warburg, a New
York securities firm. "I'm sure it will loom large in the elections."</LD>
<TE>   O'Neill blamed the situation on the recession and the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks. "This action is necessary," he wrote in notifying
Congress, ". . . to eliminate the threat of terrorism, restore the
American economy to the path of long-term growth and ensure the premier
status of the federal government's debt obligations."</TE>
<TE>   The outcome is not in question. Failing to boost the ceiling would
cause an unprecedented default on payments to holders of government
bonds. But the vote will reopen a rancorous debate over the tax and
spending priorities of the Bush administration and its allies.</TE>
<TE>   A federal government deficit also could have a broad effect on the
long-term economy. Government surpluses are credited with helping drive
the robust economic growth of the late 1990s by driving down interest
rates and spurring confidence among consumers and business.</TE>
<TE>   The new deficit will foreshadow battles over the 2003 budget that
President Bush will submit to Congress in early February and could lead
to reconsideration of some of last year's tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "Having to raise the debt ceiling tells us we've crossed a certain
threshold," said Robert Bixby, executive director of the fiscally
conservative Concord Coalition. "It tells us we can't count on huge
surpluses for as far as the eye can see to bail us out of all of our
problems. Some choices are going to have to be made, not in the future,
but right now."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats in Congress are expected to use the debt-ceiling debate to
renew their claim that Bush and his Republican allies squandered the
surplus with last year's $1.3-trillion tax-cut package. The
administration, which would prefer to keep the debt-ceiling discussion
low-key, says its tax cuts have played only a minor supporting role in
the short-term fiscal squeeze.</TE>
<TE>   "The economic slowdown had four times the impact on the [current-year]
surplus as the tax relief," Treasury spokeswoman Betsy Holahan said
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Under government accounting rules, the debt ceiling eventually would
have to be raised even if Washington paid off all of the Treasury
securities currently held by the public. That's because the ceiling
applies not only to the publicly held debt but also to the IOUs issued to
the Social Security and Medicare trust funds as long as they are running
surpluses.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, the administration said the current debt ceiling--the
maximum amount of debt Congress allows the Treasury Department to
issue--would provide plenty of headroom until at least 2008, even with
the big tax cuts that Bush was seeking. It issued more-conservative
forecasts in August, saying the ceiling would not need to be raised until
2003.</TE>
<TE>   The economic downturn and Sept. 11 changed all that. The recession has
reduced tax collections and increased spending on unemployment benefits,
food stamps, health care and other forms of assistance. Congress passed
and Bush signed $40 billion in emergency spending and a $15-billion
airline bailout. More spending increases are in the pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   Now there are only a few inches remaining between the ceiling and the
debt, which stood at more than $5.94 trillion at the stroke of midnight
Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Administration critics acknowledge that the need to raise the debt
ceiling within the next few weeks is largely attributable to the economic
slump and the war on terrorism, and that short periods of deficit
spending are appropriate during recessions.</TE>
<TE>   But they contend that the debt ceiling calls attention to a
longer-term fiscal problem caused mainly by the $1.3-trillion tax-cut
package sought by Bush and approved by Congress last year. The big tax
cuts could cause the government to run deficits year after year, they
say, closing a window of opportunity to pay down the public debt to
prepare for future revenue shortfalls in Social Security and Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   That window was opened as a result of a series of politically painful
budget reforms; tax increases and spending restraints approved during the
administrations of Ronald Reagan, the elder George Bush and Bill Clinton;
and the economic boom of the '90s. The government recorded its last
annual deficit in 1997--the last time the debt ceiling had to be
raised--and has been operating in the black ever since.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a huge achievement that was destroyed very quickly," said
Caroline Atkinson, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and
a former Clinton administration Treasury official.</TE>
<TE>   "It really is quite like Reagan in the early years," Atkinson said.
"It's a fundamental shift in the nation's public finances that occurred
with passage of the tax bill last spring. It's a shift for the worse."</TE>
<TE>   Atkinson and the Concord Coalition's Bixby are among those who think
Congress should consider rescinding some of the future reductions
contained in last year's tax bill.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that any realistic assessment of our fiscal situation going
forward has to include revisiting those tax cuts," Bixby said. "The
situation is so much different than when they were passed."</TE>

<TE>Where the Surplus Went</TE>
<TE>Five months ago, the Congressional Budget Office projected a
$176-billion surplus for the current fiscal year ending Sept. 30
and a $172-billion surplus in fiscal 2003. It now appears likely
that the government will engage in deficit spending both years.
Here's what happened:</TE>

<HD>Pressure Is on Sharon to Negotiate</HD>
<DH>Mideast: As U.S. envoy returns and violence ebbs, Israeli leader
faces new calls to open talks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>With the return to the region today of the United States' special
Middle East envoy, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon faces new pressure
to move into broader diplomatic talks with the Palestinians--something he
has steadfastly resisted.</LD>
<LD>   Retired Marine Corps Gen. Anthony C. Zinni will be picking up the
pieces of his earlier peace-seeking mission, which coincided with a surge
in violence before ending in failure last month. The U.S. government
decided this week to send Zinni back to the Middle East to take advantage
of a period of relative calm.</LD>
<LD>   As in his earlier mission, Zinni will urge Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat to crack down on militants responsible for
suicide bombings and other attacks on Israelis, but this time he will
also put pressure on Sharon, urging him to ease restrictions on
Palestinians.</LD>
<TE>   Until recently, Arafat did little to comply with the U.S. requests.
But on Dec. 16, the day after Zinni left and three days after Sharon
declared the Palestinian leader "irrelevant," Arafat went on Palestinian
television and ordered his people to stop targeting Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Violence that has raged for the last 15 months has since dropped
sharply.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon argues that Arafat has not done enough, and he continues to
refuse to deal with the Palestinian leader. Zinni and Sharon are expected
to disagree over the significance of the lull in violence, diplomats say.
Sharon is maintaining his insistence on seven days of absolute calm
before further negotiations; U.S. officials think that is unrealistic.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon is also at loggerheads with his dovish foreign minister, Shimon
Peres, over the issue. Peres is urging the government to consider moving
on to fuller peace talks, given the recent days of lessened unrest.</TE>
<TE>   Peres said at a news conference Wednesday that he hoped Zinni would
solidify the cease-fire and then push the two sides into a political
process. "I think there's a beginning that should be strengthened, and
then we can go ahead," Peres said. "Time should not be wasted."</TE>
<TE>   Since Arafat's Dec. 16 address, one Israeli has been slain, by
Palestinians who apparently infiltrated the country from Jordan, and 20
Palestinians have been killed--14 by Israeli troops and six by Arafat's
security forces during clashes with Islamic militants.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, however, maintains that the Palestinian efforts still fall far
short. He argues that shootings have continued in the last couple of
weeks and that any decline is because of Israeli intervention, not
Palestinian proscription. Further, he says, the Palestinian Authority has
yet to dismantle what he calls the "terrorist infrastructure" used by
Palestinian radicals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear that the week of calm is not behind us, because every day
we are witness to the permanent dosage of terrorism," Sharon's Cabinet
secretary, Gideon Saar, said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Saar acknowledged that the number of incidents has declined by more
than 50%, from 20 to 30 a day before Dec. 16 to 10 a day now. An incident
can be anything from an explosion to potshots. The Israeli army said it
has thwarted at least one suicide bomber in the past two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't recommend that under these circumstances we declare this
to be quiet," Saar told Israel's Army Radio. "There is no quiet."</TE>
<TE>   Defining "quiet," diplomats said, will be a major point of contention
between Zinni and Sharon. The U.S. decision to send Zinni again, after
his frustrating first foray, is tacit recognition that violence has
subsided significantly.</TE>
<TE>   As he did in his first visit, Zinni is expected to put pressure on
Arafat. He will tell the Palestinian leader to intensify the effort to
arrest militants, which the Palestinian Authority says it is doing;
arrest higher-ranking suspects; and dismantle bomb factories and other
infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials have described the arrests so far as a sham, with
only 10 people from Israel's 33 most-wanted list having been picked up,
and with no serious interrogations or punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sharon escaped U.S. pressure during Zinni's first mission, he
will be told this time to take concrete steps to ease curbs on
Palestinians, including the closures that have shut off virtually every
Palestinian town. Sharon's office said Wednesday that it had ordered
roadblocks to be lifted, but Palestinians across the West Bank said they
discerned no change. And Peres said restrictions are being announced but
not implemented.</TE>
<TE>   A senior aide to Sharon said in an interview that the prime minister's
goal is to be rid of Arafat. Consequently, no effort that Arafat makes
will be sufficient to force Sharon to open up to political negotiations.
Sharon is waiting for a post-Arafat era, the official said, and will
adamantly refuse to deal with Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   If true, that will surely complicate Zinni's mission. Diplomats said
Zinni hopes to move Israelis and Palestinians beyond the nuts and bolts
of cease-fire and closer to a peace plan drafted last year by a team led
by former U.S. Sen. George J. Mitchell.</TE>
<TE>   The Mitchell plan envisions an unconditional end to violence, Israeli
withdrawal from Palestinian land occupied in the last 15 months,
Palestinian confiscation of illegal weapons, and a freeze on Jewish
settlement expansion in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   The suggestion of making concessions to Arafat has brought Sharon into
confrontation not only with Peres but also with Israeli President Moshe
Katsav, a member of Sharon's right-wing Likud Party. Katsav said he was
considering a proposal to address the Palestinian Legislative Council to
call for a yearlong cease-fire. Sharon swiftly rejected the idea,
angering Katsav, in a rare public rift.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians say they have arrested dozens of militants and closed
down several offices of the Hamas movement and Islamic Jihad, the two
groups responsible for most suicide bombings. Israel, meanwhile, has
pressed ahead with a series of sweeps on Palestinian-ruled towns and
villages, staging nine raids and capturing 45 suspects in the last two
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, Israeli police arrested a prominent Palestinian
activist as he held a meeting in largely Arab East Jerusalem. The
activist, Mustafa Barghouti, is a doctor who heads emergency medical
relief for Palestinians. His associates said he was arrested, released
and then rearrested at a checkpoint on the northern edge of Jerusalem,
where police allegedly beat him.</TE>

<HD>New Study Aims Cut 101 Gridlock</HD>
<DH>Transit: Several agencies are backing the analysis, but commuters
doubt it will help reduce traffic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new study of the 101 Freeway hailed as the most comprehensive
analysis ever of this nightmare of a commuting artery is underway, a
consortium of government agencies announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The $4.5-million, three-year effort seeks to reduce congestion and
improve safety along the 40-mile stretch from downtown Los Angeles
through Hollywood, crossing the San Fernando Valley to Thousand Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers will seek public input through three community meetings
this month. But the study already is being greeted with skepticism by
commuters who have grown weary of studies done on everything from
interchange improvements to double-decking the freeway to building a
trolley line along the median.</LD>
<TE>   "Not only do studies come and go, not only has there been no action,
the problems [on the 101] are getting worse and worse," said Richard
Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. "When will the
studies end and the constructions begin?"</TE>
<TE>   "The 101 has been studied to death," said Richard Katz, co-chairman of
the San Fernando Valley Transportation Strike Force.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters said the new study will be different and may lead to
change.</TE>
<TE>   One of the busiest corridors in California, the 101--also known as the
Ventura Freeway along one stretch and the Hollywood Freeway along
another--is often gridlocked in both directions during peak commuting
hours. The freeway channels traffic to and from downtown, Burbank movie
studios, the Van Nuys government complex and Warner Center in Woodland
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The 101 is home to two of California's three busiest interchanges,
where it grinds across the Harbor Freeway downtown and the San Diego
Freeway in Sherman Oaks, said Tom Choe, chief of freeway operations for
Caltrans. Only the interchange between the Harbor and Santa Monica
freeways near downtown has more traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The study "is not going to be just another study," said state Sen.
Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica), who helped secure much of its funding when
she was in the Assembly. Unlike previous analyses, this one will seek
public input, examine the entire corridor rather than bits and pieces of
it and identify short-term as well as long-term solutions, Kuehl said.
Another goal is to identify funding sources.</TE>
<TE>   The study is being conducted by Parsons Brinckerhoff Inc., an
engineering consulting firm headquartered in New York with offices
throughout California. It is being funded with $3 million from Gov. Gray
Davis' Traffic Congestion Relief Program and additional money from
Caltrans, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Las Virgenes-Malibu
Council of Governments and the Southern California Assn. of Governments.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with other studies, this one is "not amorphous" and has the
most comprehensive collaboration of local governments and agencies, which
will help ensure its success, said Los Angeles County Supervisor and MTA
board member Zev Yaroslavsky.</TE>
<TE>   Community meetings will be held from 6 to 8 p.m. on Jan. 22 at Encino
Tarzana Medical Center, 16237 Ventura Blvd., Encino; on Jan. 23 at
Calabasas Community Center, 27040 Malibu Hills Road, Calabasas; and on
Jan. 24 at Los Angeles City College, 855 N. Vermont Ave., Los Angeles.

<TE>   Humphrey Bogart stars as two of the most celebrated private
eyes--Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade--in a double feature at the New
Beverly. Director Howard Hawks' adaptation of Raymond Chandler's
hard-boiled Marlowe crime novel "The Big Sleep" is a great, taut
memento of the '40s--ribald and dangerous, racy and smart. Bogey also
shines as the cynical Spade in "The Maltese Falcon." Dashiell
Hammett's superb thriller, paradigm of the whole private-eye genre,
was John Huston's classy directorial debut. Better movie literary
adaptations than this are rarer than the bird itself.</TE>

<TE>   He who lives by the sword, dies by the ... yeah, yeah, yeah.
Whatever. What's really cool about Akira Kurosawa's 1954 classic "The
Seven Samurai" is its relationship to the American western--both
those that came before and those after. Though set in feudal Japan,
Kurosawa borrowed heavily from John Ford, setting his epic in vast
untamed expanses and populating his tale with the good, the bad and
those who patrol the median. Seven samurai--including actors Toshira
Mifune and Takashi Shimura--are petitioned by a village of
impoverished farmers to protect them from the yearly ravages of the
roaming brigands. A small war follows, in which only a handful
survive. Furious and savagely exciting, it's one of the screen's
superlative adventure epics. The film was, of course, actually remade
as a western in 1960 and influenced the sub-genre of "professional
westerns."</TE>
