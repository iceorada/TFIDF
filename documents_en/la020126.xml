<LD>Even punk rock needs its institutions, and in sheer force and
unexpected longevity Bad Religion certainly qualifies. In a 90-minute
performance at the Whisky on Thursday, the hometown punk icons
reignited their attack of action and intelligence, a still-urgent
sound two decades on.</LD>
<LD>   Bad Religion started as just another band of teenagers with loud
guitars and went on to become a major player in the genre and a
crucial influence on such later acts as Green Day and Rancid.  The
Whisky performance, opening three nights of shows at Sunset Strip
clubs, also marked the formal return of founding guitarist Brett
Gurewitz, who left in 1994 to battle a drug addiction and to run his
Epitaph Records label. He was energetic, once even playing a solo
with his teeth, but he seemed almost subdued beside Greg Hetson, who
bounced and slashed at his guitar virtually nonstop.</LD>
<LD>   Singer Greg Graffin remained the focal point, joking casually with
fans between lyrics of charged geopolitical content. His songs were
genuinely anthemic and clearheaded. Despite his role as a
fist-pumping punk-rock lecturer, his mood was almost cheery, even
during the angry new environmental diatribe "Kyoto Now."</LD>
<TE>   The mosh pit was predictably most active during the better-known
material ("Suffer," "Recipe for Hate," "Infected"), but many fans
sang along just as loudly to songs from the just-released "The
Process of Belief."</TE>
<TE>   Proof enough that in 2002 Bad Religion is both reunited and
rejuvenated.</TE>
<TE>   Bad Religion plays tonight at the Key Club, 9039 Sunset Blvd.,
West Hollywood, 8 p.m. Sold out. (310) 274-5800.</TE>

<HD>A Deep  Experience</HD>
<DH>David Attenborough's 'Blue Planet,' which  explores life in
the world's oceans and seas,  takes on a new context after Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GRITTEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>RICHMOND, England</DL>
<LD>David Attenborough's new natural history series, "The Blue Planet,"
an exploration of the world's oceans and seas, could hardly have had
a less fortunately timed world broadcast premiere.</LD>
<LD>   The BBC aired its first episode on Sept. 12, the day after the
most shattering events in recent history. "It seems dreadful to
suggest there are these terrible events, that you have a titanic
problem on that scale and on the other hand you have this program
out, and you worry no one will notice it," he said. "But I have to
admit it did occur to me."</LD>
<LD>   In fact, something astonishing happened. "The Blue Planet" aired
as scheduled. Not only did critics rave, but millions of Britons
found themselves deeply moved on that emotional day by its remarkable
footage of marine life, including a breathtaking sequence of a blue
whale, the largest animal that has ever lived on Earth, plowing
through the Pacific waters off San Francisco at 30 miles an hour.</LD>
<TE>   Thousands of viewers sent letters and e-mails to the BBC,
expressing appreciation. "The extraordinary thing was, they got a
high audience," Attenborough said. "I must be careful not to be too
portentous about this, but on Sept. 12, it was the one thing you
could look at on television in which human beings played no part, and
which would be going on no matter who was bombing whom. It gave
people some solace."</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, Attenborough can see why "The Blue Planet" had such
a profound effect on a day of such global turmoil. He has long been
aware that part of the success of natural history series on TV is an
appeal that borders on the spiritual.</TE>
<TE>   "That factor heightens the undercurrent of natural history
programs," he said. "They are one of the few things on TV which have
nothing to do with human politics or people trying to sell you
something. The natural world is beautiful, it's unpredictable, and
it's also true in a profound sense.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to present it as it is. Our sin is that we don't want to
put human beings in the picture, and of course in reality they are in
the picture. What human beings do affects the animal kingdom. The
picture we convey is of wild nature, as if human beings are not
included. That's a distortion, an illusion. But the consequences are
that we as program makers benefit from the perception that there are
no human beings [on screen]."</TE>
<TE>   Now American viewers have a chance to see "The Blue Planet,"
starting Sunday on the Discovery Channel, which co-produced the
series with the BBC. Even by the standards of Attenborough's upscale
natural history series, this one is lavish and expensive. It took
five years to make and was filmed in 200 locations worldwide. It
reveals extraordinary marine life and behavior that had never before
been captured on film and filmed some species that were only recently
known to scientists.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these hitherto unfilmed creatures inhabit the deep ocean,
more than 3,000 feet below the ocean's surface, where they survive
without light. They included the winteria, a fish with extraordinary
tubular eyes designed to look upward to spot silhouettes of potential
prey, and the hairy anglerfish, which is covered with antennae that
are sensitive to the most minute movements in the water.</TE>
<TE>   To film these creatures, cameramen had to be lowered in special
submersibles, tough enough to withstand the extraordinary pressure at
that depth. "There are only six or seven in the whole world that can
go down that far," he noted.</TE>
<TE>   This year marks Attenborough's 50th in the television industry,
and he is arguably Britain's most revered broadcaster, a TV figure as
important here as Edward R. Murrow or Walter Cronkite is to
Americans. Attenborough first appeared on the BBC in 1954, presenting
a nature program called "Zoo Quest," and though he took a seven-year
break behind the cameras as a senior BBC executive, his preeminence
as a nature series presenter has never been questioned.</TE>
<TE>   Attenborough believes natural history series on TV are a response
to the kind of desire to gaze upon nature that so absorbed Henry
David Thoreau, Jean Jacques Rousseau and William Wordsworth: "The
contemplation of a natural world in which we play no part has a
spiritual component, which is why we do it. The subject has this
awfully powerful appeal." "The Blue Planet" proposes the view that
the world's oceans are a kind of last frontier, one that covers 70%
of the planet yet is largely unknown. More than half the Earth's
surface is covered by ocean more than a mile deep, and light never
penetrates.</TE>
<TE>   "Logistically, it was tough and expensive," Attenborough says. "I
know from experience that anything you do with boats means you
multiply production costs by three. Working on boats just takes
forever."</TE>
<TE>   Attenborough lives in a rambling house in this affluent suburb on
the river Thames, west of London; artifacts from his travels all over
the world lie dotted around the ground floor rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in a cardigan sweater, open-necked khaki shirt and casual
slacks, he is very much off duty, but his on-camera manner is never
far away; a kindly man with a dry sense of humor, he often leans
forward to make a point with great intensity and seems always to make
sure the listener has understood him.</TE>
<TE>   Attenborough is 75, and it seems logical that he might be thinking
of scaling back his globetrotting. But one sequence in "The Blue
Planet" shows him with a big grin on the deck of a crew boat,
plunging through waves as it tries to keep up with the rapid progress
of a blue whale just ahead. Indeed, he has no intention of quitting
and, while also writing his autobiography, he is preparing his next
major series, which will be about mammals.</TE>
<TE>   "People think mammals and animals are synonymous," he said dryly.
"So this one will feature all the 'pattables' and 'cuddlies.' It's
what people want to know about. People don't really want to know
about animals they have never heard of. Though I'm deeply keen to do
programs about them: olingos, cacomistles, gundis." He rolled the
unfamiliar words around his mouth.</TE>
<TE>   Attenborough has two areas of concerns for the future of natural
history programming: style and funding.</TE>
<TE>   "These days, there's a stylistic nervousness," he noted. "Style is
more implicit than we recognize. There seems to be a need to speed
everything up. The shows I did more than 25 years ago we would now
find slow and wordy.</TE>
<TE>   "But the subject matter doesn't change. Some of it is so powerful
it's impervious to style. If you see a lion killing a wildebeest and
it's well shot, it doesn't need style."</TE>
<TE>   The kinds of series Attenborough makes may never make it to US
network television, but they are shown on mainstream channels in
other countries, including Britain. His groundbreaking 1979 series
"Life on Earth" was seen by 500 million people worldwide, made a
fortune in video sales and is still used as a teaching aid in
universities.</TE>
<TE>   He is more perturbed by the threat of a multi-channel TV universe
to his brand of expensive nature shows: "If you have 30 networks
rather than just three, that means everyone gets 10% as much money.
As it is, the BBC couldn't contemplate making these series without an
American co-producer." He sighed.</TE>
<TE>   "I worry. I doubt if there will be many more budgets available to
do anything comparable to 'Blue Planet.'"</TE>
<TE>   "The Blue Planet" parts 1 and 2 air Sunday night at 9 on
Discovery, with parts 3 and 4 airing Monday, also at 9. The network
has rated it TV-G (suitable for all ages).</TE>

<HD>(Mexican) American Bandstand Keeps Hopping</HD>
<DH>The bilingual 'LATV Live' television show is drawing the
top names in Latin pop while retaining a decidedly edgy feel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"LATV Live" has the look of a television show taken over by a band of
Latino college kids with an unruly enthusiasm for music and esoteric
tastes.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of sharing their favorite music videos with
their roommates, this kinetic crew of twentysomethings gets to play
at being veejays in prime time on KJLA, a full-power station that
reaches almost 3 million households in Southern California over the
air (Channel 57), via satellite and on most area cable systems.</LD>
<LD>   These veejays love the camera, you can tell. The women look sexy,
the men act cool or try to. But they all look like people you might
have met in L.A., the young, bilingual Latinos you see
everywhere--except on television.</LD>
<TE>   Yet there they are, rotating one-hour time slots as hosts of
L.A.'s only locally produced music video broadcast. They work mostly
in English, sometimes stumble over their Spanish and confess to being
nervous about interviewing visiting celebrities. And rightfully so:
Their fledgling show has drawn the top names in Latin pop and rock en
espanol, from Juanes to Jaguares.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a show that amazes me," says New York-based publicist Josh
Norek, who represents such Latin alternative acts as Mexico's Julieta
Venegas, who also appeared in person on "LATV." "They're really one
of the only stations that regularly plays this music. For all of the
acts I work with, 'LATV' is their only U.S. television appearance."</TE>
<TE>   "LATV" is the moniker for a block of local programs produced
at KJLA studios in West Los Angeles. But this is no piddling public
access outlet; it's a 5-million-watt operation with annual revenues
of almost $5 million, mostly from religious shows, infomercials and
shopping programs. The live Latin talent takes over from 8 to 10 p.m.
Mondays through Wednesdays, with a "best of" on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its cachet, the show still has the edgy spontaneity of
something that seems vaguely underground. The set has the air of a
downtown artists' loft, industrial brick and concrete turned trendy
on the cheap. The hosts interview guests on modern, brightly colored
couches, while the rambunctious audience, many of its members too
young to drive themselves to the studios, sits on bleachers, cheering
like students at a high school pep rally.</TE>
<TE>   "With 'LATV,' the secret is the interaction: You have the
audience, you have the veejays, and once in a while they mess up, so
they're real people," says Marcela Cuenze, a Los Angeles publicist
and longtime rock en espanol fan. "It doesn't seem Hollywood.... It's
more like 'Wayne's World.'"</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the show's unconventional mystique is the quirky
selection of music videos, ranging from the narco-corridos of Lupillo
Rivera to the empty-calorie pop of Paulina Rubio to the
cholo-cum-cumbia sound of El Gran Silencio. While the show
increasingly airs the mainstream music of such artists as Enrique
Iglesias, it prides itself on featuring new, noncommercial music that
can't be heard anywhere else.</TE>
<TE>   "LATV" is part of a deliberate strategy to reach a large and largely
ignored market:  L.A.'s bilingual youth who love Latin music but can't
always relate to the all-Spanish format of traditional Latin radio and
television.</TE>
<TE>   "Central to what we do is that we let the people of L.A. see
themselves in the show," says Danny Crowe, KJLA's vice president of
programming and a pioneer in Latin rock radio. "Our audience is a
bilingual audience, and it's a young audience. It's the next
generation."</TE>
<TE>   The station's owner and president is Walter Ulloa, the Mexican
American media entrepreneur who is also chairman and chief executive
of Entravision Communication of Santa Monica, a Latino media
conglomerate with 55 radio stations and 23 Univision network
television affiliates in Latino markets throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   So although "LATV" may relish its role as the scrappy David
fighting the Goliath of Spanish-language programming, it's actually
all in the family. When deejays from the L.A. pop-rock Spanish radio
station Super Estrella (97.5 FM and 103.1 FM) visited the set of
"LATV Live" earlier this month to help celebrate the show's one-year
anniversary, most viewers were unaware they were watching media
synergy in action: Ulloa owns the radio station too.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the corporate connections, KJLA has had to muscle its way
into L.A. households, legally forcing cable companies to make room on
their lineups for the scrappy newcomer, founded in 1990. The push
paid off, as the station has more than tripled its cable penetration
in the last three years, says Francis Wilkinson, general manager at
KJLA, which can now be seen from Santa Maria to Santa Ana and from
Brentwood to Barstow.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of the age-old story of a smaller, minority-
owned station having to fight to get its due rights in the
marketplace," says Wilkinson.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, KJLA's cable expansion means many more potential
viewers for its music shows, which also include the weekly
"Rok-a-Mole" (rhymes with "guacamole"), a pure rock en espanol show
hosted on Friday nights by Josh Kun.</TE>
<TE>   "LATV's" live, party-like feel is carefully planned, a sort of
scripted spontaneity. Comedian and actor Paul Saucido, one of the
original veejays, at first tried too hard to perform for the camera.
But he and the other novice veejays got the same direction: Just act
as if you're playing your favorite videos for your friends.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're all doing is sharing the music," says Flavio Morales,
"LATV's" mellow and affable program director. "So be as normal and
casual and charming as you are in real life."</TE>
<TE>   "LATV's" appeal also rests in the raw, raving excitement the hosts
express for the music they play. The veejays, like their audience,
were raised in bicultural musical environments, listening to Depeche
Mode with their friends and to Los Panchos with their parents. Veejay
Patricia Lopez, who is 6 feet, 1 inch tall, uses the e-mail nickname
"patylonglegs," grew up listening to the Cure but went crazy when she
discovered rock en espanol one night not long ago at JC Fandango, a
Latino nightclub in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "It was literally like taking blinders off," says Lopez. "I had no
idea this music existed.... And it's the best thing in the world."</TE>
<TE>   For Saucido, whose parents listened to both Eydie Gorme and Jimi
Hendrix, "LATV" is a way of aiming at a crossover audience in
reverse, exposing multiethnic audiences to Latin sounds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost a re-acculturation," says Saucido, who sports spiky
hair, a goatee and trendy, tinted glasses. "I want to get those other
cats who love good music, whether Anglo, black, Latino or Asian....
If they can follow the host, and if the music is good, they'll watch
the show."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez and Saucido were the station's first music veejays, hosting
the seminal show "Puro Pop," which aired once a week from a tiny
studio in Tarzana. At one point, "LATV" featured a slew of other
locally produced shows, one for salsa, another for tejano music and
even a Spanish version of "Candid Camera" shot in Huntington Park.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the lineup and the music have been consolidated into "LATV
Live," which has become a potpourri of Latin styles. Although the
veejays are encouraged to express their individuality on the air,
they don't get to choose the music that's played.</TE>
<TE>   Those decisions are made by Morales, the round-faced program
director who started his career as an intern at a public access
station in East L.A., where he was born and raised. Morales is best
known as co-host of "Illegal Interns," a long-running music and talk
show now off the air. Morales proudly mentions that he interviewed
members of the Nortec Collective before the acclaimed experimental
Tijuana group was even signed to a label.</TE>
<TE>   At "LATV," he says, his musical tastes have expanded. The station
plays a wide spectrum of music because it needs to reach a broader
audience, especially if it's to continue to gain advertisers like
KFC, Juanita's Menudo and Universal Pictures. Most of the veejays
seem to relish their dual roles as pitchmen for circuses and fast
food, realizing that advertisers pay their fees, modest as they are.</TE>
<TE>   But will fans of progressive Latin music have the patience for the
more commercial pop mixed in with their "LATV"?</TE>
<TE>   "They'll keep watching," assures Morales, "because there's nothing
else out there for them."</TE>

<HD>Tori Enters, Stage Left</HD>
<DH>Tori Spelling, she of TV's most famous ZIP Code, moves to
the stage and welcomes the challenge. 'I was like, wow, how could any
actor pass this up?'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tori Spelling is making her professional stage debut.</LD>
<LD>   Quit waiting for the punch line. The actress best known for
spending a decade in high school on "Beverly Hills 90210," produced
by her dad, Aaron Spelling, is starring in "Maybe Baby, It's You" at
the Coronet Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe Baby, It's You," about the agony and the ecstasy of
searching for a soul mate, was written by Charlie Shanian and Shari
Simpson, for themselves. The two-character show, comprising 11 skits,
opened in New York in 1999 and at the Coronet in November, starring
Shanian and Simpson. But Simpson, recently married, decided to move
back to New York to be with her husband.</LD>
<TE>   Enter Victoria Davey Spelling.</TE>
<TE>   This television actress, Hollywood royalty by birth, has the
audacity to attempt theat-ah, albeit in a show that makes no pretense
of being Shakespeare. And while this would seem to demand an apology
of some kind to the Serious Acting Community, here is Spelling,
friendly as a new puppy, breathlessly relating how much fun it is to
do this show, to get to play all those characters, to dance and sing
and run up and down the aisles.</TE>
<TE>   "I was like, wow, how could any actor pass this up?" Spelling
bubbles. "There were a few other actresses that came to see it before
it was offered, who said, wow, it's wonderful, but it's just too
intimidating to get up there and do all those characters. I thought,
God, that's what you strive for as an actor, to be challenged. Who
cares if you fail? Take that on; do yourself a favor. See what you
can do with it."</TE>
<TE>   Spelling can't understand why anyone should want to stop her from
having such a good time. If Daddy got her her first gig, so what? "I
say thank you; it's a blessing," she says happily. "I'm so lucky--I
mean I am, to have him as a father, everything he's done for my
career. People should be happy for me. They should say: 'You're
lucky.'"</TE>
<TE>   And she seems genuinely surprised that they don't, always. "They
want to hear bad before they want to hear good. I don't know what it
is, but it's something," she says, wide-eyed. Then she laughs. "Well
... whatever."</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in blue jeans and gray sweater, Spelling appears
impossibly slender, as if there's no one inside her clothes. Sitting
in a chair in the empty theater, she's thin enough to be able to
cross her legs, at the knee, then cross them again, at the ankle.
Arms get the same twisty, nervous treatment. At times during the
conversation, she appears to have braided herself.</TE>
<TE>   The interview begins with a sad little story.</TE>
<TE>   In the first grade, Tori Spelling was cast as Becky Thatcher in a
school production of "Tom Sawyer." In the second grade, she again won
a lead role: Gretel, in "Hansel and Gretel." But the fact that Tori
got the lead again caused such an uproar among the parents that the
school canceled the show.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was so good, to have gotten the lead two years in a
row, but all the mothers complained so much that they canceled the
play, and there were no more plays for the rest of my elementary
school," recalls Spelling, 28. (She's quick to tell her age, but
that's because some people think the "90210" cast must be 40 by now.)
"I don't remember knowing what it was about, then. At the time, I
remember just thinking they were probably just jealous because I was
so good." She laughs. "But--yeah. It was probably ... that."</TE>
<TE>   During a conversation with Spelling at the Coronet, there's a lot
of talk about that--or it, depending on the sentence: the monster
known best by its ZIP Code.  But the fact that she's perfectly aware
of it renders this monster almost harmless. She laughs in its face,
just as she laughs at losing the breakout role of Gretel, Witch
Hunter. "It's something that's never going to go away, basically,"
she observes. "So I've learned to accept it."</TE>
<TE>   Spelling has appeared in movies: "The House of Yes," "Scary Movie
2" and 1999's "trick", in which she portrayed a talentless actress.
That film was a surprise hit at Sundance. And, even though Spelling
received mixed reviews ("Surprisingly good"--Toronto Star;
"alternately effective and excessive"--Los Angeles Times), there was
a lot of press speculation that a major role in a classy independent
film could launch Spelling to a new level in her career.</TE>
<TE>   But even with her recent film credits, she acknowledges the first
thing anyone sees at an audition is Tori Spelling, 90210. "I have to
really impress them to get them to like me; it has to really be
something out of the ordinary," she says, still smiling.</TE>
<TE>   "Because if it's me, they're going to say it's just another
Hollywood daughter. It's tough out there. You don't want to be
cynical, but I've been dealing with it for 28 years now, and it's
pretty much the truth.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's just given me a stronger backbone, and I just say, 'I'm
doing it, I'm not going to let bad reviews stop me from doing what I
want to do.'"</TE>
<TE>   Spelling isn't expecting bad reviews for "Maybe Baby, It's You."
"The feeling I've had so far is so amazing, I have the feeling that
for the first time in my life, I am using my craft to the best of my
ability. I know I'm good at the role. I've worked very hard, and I'm
confident about my work in this." "Doing this, I feel beautiful and
wonderful every day."</TE>
<TE>   Early reviews--well, at least from her co-star Shanian--have been
good. "I have to say this: She has impressed me with her talent, she
is a natural, she just has taken to the stage," he says. "Luckily,
with both women [Simpson and Spelling], there was that natural spark
called chemistry that occurred between us." She's also fearless,
Shanian adds. "I sometimes get nervous when I have to dance, but
she's like: "That's what I love, that's what I look forward to.' She
loves to be thrown around and tossed in the air."</TE>
<TE>   Although she likes to get crazy onstage, offstage, Spelling
describes herself as shy. She acknowledges that may arise from
spending her adolescence in a fishbowl. "I did '90210' for 10 years,
a long 10 years," she muses. "It was weird, going from teenager to
woman, with all of it being viewed under a microscope by everybody.</TE>
<TE>   "It was difficult, but I have very good morals; my parents raised
my brother [actor Randy Spelling] and me right. I never fell into the
trap of young Hollywood. You read about these young kids from rich
families who got mixed up with drugs, and I just don't understand it.
I came from a wealthy family; I was as exposed to that as anyone, so
it's not like, 'poor them'--please. You have a decision to make."</TE>
<TE>   Spelling, a graduate of Westlake School for Girls in Holmby Hills
(now merged with Harvard School as Harvard-Westlake), adds that
nothing was weirder than dating under a microscope. "Forget about
it!" says Spelling, who lives in Westwood with her pug dog. "You'd
think, here comes a guy who thinks I'm cute, and then he'd be like:
'Aren't you on that show? He wants to talk to me because I'm an
actor, not because he thinks I'm a cute girl, or interesting and
smart. That was always a huge issue for me.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think as you get older, you can immediately decipher
between those and the genuine ones," she says. "People ask why actors
always date actors. Well, it's because they having something in
common, and they don't get judged for doing their job."</TE>
<TE>   Great. Talent morals, and a stable home life with the Spelling
Bunch. But there must be something that pushes her buttons. How about
endless rumors about her extensive plastic surgery?</TE>
<TE>   "That's something I actually don't wish to talk about," she says
politely--then gamely proceeds to talk about it. "I am not the
seventh Jackson!" she exclaims. "I remember when I was 20, and there
was something in the Globe, crazy stuff like, she's had chin
implants, cheek implants, ribs removed--God, head to toe. And a quote
from someone saying: 'I went to high school with her, and she didn't
look anything like this.' And they had a picture of me when I was in
the ninth grade.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought: 'OK, listen, honey. I didn't know how to pluck
eyebrows at that point, I had baby fat on my face, I didn't realize
at that point that you could use bleach in your hair or that the '80s
perm was out. Ever since then, I read things like the Queen of
Plastic Surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't look at myself and say: 'Oh, I'm the prettiest girl.' I
think I'm a fairly normal-looking girl," she adds--laughing, as
usual. "I don't know why anyone would go out of their way to say I've
had all this plastic surgery done, because if I had, I'd probably
look a lot better than I do.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always like: 'How can people misconstrue me?' I'm very
willing to talk about anything, whatever, I'm not guarded; my life's
pretty much an open book. Even though people are always all up into
your business, I haven't been one of those people who won't talk. I'm
still the sucker. I like talking. I like people."</TE>

<HD>Milne and Cosmic Dapp Extend Their Groove</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taking on an extended run at a jazz club would be a daunting
challenge for a well-known artist. For pianist Andy Milne and his
Cosmic Dapp Theory ensemble, the prospect of a four-week run at the
new Rocco jazz room would seem to have its quixotic aspects.</LD>
<LD>   Still, Rocco is not a particularly large room, and if the buzz
gets out--as it should--about the fascinating music that is being
offered by the Milne group, it might not turn out to be such a dicey
booking after all.</LD>
<LD>   Milne's approach to making things happen for his band hearkens
back to the days before rock 'n' roll and roadies, the time when
musicians packed their gear into a van and took off to find an
audience. In fact, Milne, harmonica player Gregoire Maret, drummer
Sean Rickman, bassist Rich Brown and rapper Kokayi arrived in town
after a cross-country drive--with a stopover for a gig in
Denver--from New York City.</LD>
<TE>   Musicians who experience togetherness of that sort either wind up
committing mayhem on each other or discover some close personal and
musical connections. In the case of Thursday night's performance by
Cosmic Dapp, the latter was very much the case.</TE>
<TE>   Milne has been on his own musical quest for years, his imagination
enhanced by associations with saxophonists Steve Coleman and Ravi
Coltrane, among others. His current group--with the exception of a
new addition, drummer Rickman--is the same sterling collective he
brought to Rocco in 2000, when the club was at its original Bel-Air
location.</TE>
<TE>   If anything, the music was even more compelling than in that
original booking. Milne and his players have the capacity to perform
in complex rhythms, but there was never a sense of urgency about
making metric deadlines, as so often happens when musicians improvise
in 5/4, 7/4, etc.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the rhythm unfolded in overlapping layers--similar in
method, if different in style, to Afro-Cuban rhythms, energized by a
tremendous sense of propulsion. Rickman, always maintaining the
semblance of a funk groove pocket, held the other elements together
as they darted back and forth in all directions.</TE>
<TE>   Among other intriguing aspects about this always-fascinating
ensemble: Kokayi's brisk blend of rap and scat, enlivened by a witty
verbal sense of humor; Maret's passionate harmonica work, delivered
in his own original style; Brown's sturdy, highly imaginative bass
lines.</TE>
<TE>   And, above all, Milne's keyboard work, lush with harmonies
(especially during a soulful cruise through Dizzy Gillespie's "Con
Alma"), a powerful central musical core for the ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Milne's Cosmic Dapp Theory at Rocco, 6320 Santa Monica Blvd.
Tonight at 10:30 p.m., $15; Sunday at 9:30 p.m., $10. Continuing
Wednesday through Sunday, Jan. 30-Feb. 3, and Tuesdays through
Saturdays, Feb. 5 through Feb. 16. (323) 804-4146.</TE>

<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How many times can a best-selling author transfuse from the same
blood supply?</LD>
<LD>   As unoriginal as haunted house stories get, "Stephen King's Rose
Red" is his "Carrie" and "The Shining" meets "Ghostbusters," "Night
of the Living Dead" and the Psychic Hotline. Written by the prolific
King, this overwrought, overacted three-parter on ABC is campy, not
scary or even stomach-turning.</LD>
<LD>   Laughter is the only option when Seattle college professor Joyce
Reardon (Nancy Travis) and her team of six telepathic, pre-cognitive
and post-cognitive telekinetics--everyone is here but the Amazing
Kreskin--begin tiptoeing through Rose Red, a 95-year-old mansion that
she believes has "eaten" 23 people since World War I. It was built by
a relative of her boyfriend, Steve (Matt Keeslar), who joins her and
the group for this weekend of cobwebs and corpses whose eyes open
like a ventriloquist dummy's.</LD>
<TE>   Reardon's agenda? She wants her band of high-strung paranormals to
"awaken" Rose Red from its dormancy as a haunted mansion so that she
can rescue her academic career by proving to a skeptical rival, the
clownishly namby-pamby professor Carl Miller (the late David Dukes),
that "the unexplained" really does exist.</TE>
<TE>   Miller plots with a snotty campus newspaper reporter to undermine
Reardon's project. The least normal of her "paras" is 15-year-old
Annie (Kimberly J. Brown), who expresses herself by making things
explode. You'll also meet nasty Emery (Matt Ross), who is terrified
of his overbearing mother (Laura Kenny); trusting Cathy (Judith
Ivey), who puts her faith in the Lord; and Nick (Julian Sands), who
repeatedly gives Steve come-hither looks, obviously intending to out
him as a ...</TE>
<TE>   POWERFUL PSYCHIC TRANSMITTER.</TE>
<TE>   You needn't be telepathic to anticipate what's coming before
King's characters do. Obviously, they haven't read his books.</TE>
<TE>   When these slugs are warned "not to go off wandering," expect one
of them to wander. When someone says an antique phonograph player
doesn't work, you know music is coming. And when someone asks, "Is
anybody here?," expect the slime to hit the fan.</TE>
<TE>   Second favorite line: "You shouldn't go alone."</TE>
<TE>   But of course, someone always does. Put yourself into this
picture. You're in the dark, in a haunted house that is terrifying
you. What do you do, all by yourself?</TE>
<TE>   EXPLORE!</TE>
<TE>   Such are the horror-film cliches of "Rose Red," all the way
through a convoluted and excruciatingly loud and chaotic Part 3,
which yields one over-the-top performance after another as cast
members take turns impersonating Jack Nicholson in "The Shining."
These excesses are abetted by director Craig R. Baxley, the shame
being that this miniseries is the final legacy of Dukes, who died of
a heart attack during its production.</TE>
<TE>   In Humans vs. House, you may find yourself pulling for the house.
If only Rose Red had eaten the script, the real spooks here being its
author and those at ABC that decided to drag this chalky cadaver
across three nights.</TE>
<TE>   "Stephen King's Rose Red" will be shown Sunday, Monday and
Thursday nights at 9. The network has rated it TV-14-V (may be
unsuitable for children under the age of 14, with a special advisory
for violence).</TE>

<HD>23 Years and Sept. 11: 'NBR' Adapts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLAN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Viewers of PBS' "Nightly Business Report" wouldn't know by looking at
it, but it's probably the only broadcast on television that has been
affected physically by the events of Sept. 11. That the on-camera
product hasn't suffered is something of a testament to a series that
Tuesday celebrated its 23rd year of operation.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't believe how well these people performed under such trying
conditions," says Paul Kangas, who has anchored "Nightly Business
Report" since it was a 15-minute financial news update show in Miami
23 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   When the World Trade Center was destroyed more than four months
ago, it caused damage to the building that houses "NBR's" New York
bureau (its home base is in Miami, with bureaus in Chicago and
Washington), which was two blocks away. Water damage, as well as the
area around the former towers becoming a crime scene, caused
production to be moved to other locations.</LD>
<TE>   "There was very limited entry just to check on the equipment to
see what was what," says executive editor Linda O'Bryon, who helped
found "NBR" in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   The show is now based in a building a few miles from its former
home, but in the first few days following Sept. 11, production moved
from New York-based co-host Susie Gharib's home to hotel space.
Broadcast equipment had to be rented, and the show's tape library was
inaccessible.</TE>
<TE>   The one on-air change is that instead of Gharib anchoring the show
from a New York studio, she is now originating reports from the floor
of the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "My day-to-day reporting is in Midtown, with the rest of the team
in our temporary newsroom. And we're still very much in a temporary
situation," says Gharib, a veteran business news reporter in print
and on TV who has been with "NBR" since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know yet what the plans are--if we're going to go back
down to the Wall Street area to our original offices, or if we are
going to relocate elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   But even without the facilities they had before, "we still have
the same level of coverage, the same interviews," O'Bryon says. "It
kind of expands your horizons in a sense. I think the look of the
show is terrific with Susie right there at the center of things at
the NYSE. It's just we've had to become more flexible, more adaptable
in terms of how we do things."</TE>
<TE>   That's a point that bears out in the ratings. Because "NBR" is on
public TV, and such business contemporaries as CNN's "Lou Dobbs
Moneyline" and CNBC's "Business Center" are on cable, audience
measures are skewed, since Nielsen uses different methods to measure
viewing on cable.</TE>
<TE>   But while "Moneyline" was seen during the fourth quarter of last
year in 841,000 households, "NBR" isn't too far off that mark
nationally.</TE>
<TE>   "It just shows me the staying power of the crew and the
capabilities," Kangas says. "A lot of people that were with us
originally are still here. And it just shows me that the staying
power and the ability to respond to tough conditions is part of our
whole makeup."</TE>

<HD>'Dragonfly TV' Adds MTV-Style Zip to Science</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>OXFORD, Ohio</DL>
<LD>"Dragonfly TV," the new PBS science series for children, looks a lot
like an MTV video to some adults.</LD>
<LD>   "This stuff moves fast, and it has incessant music," said
executive producer Richard Hudson.</LD>
<LD>   "Dragonfly TV" comes from Twin Cities Public Television, producer
of the long-running "Newton's Apple," and is based on a children's
magazine developed at Miami (Ohio) University. The show is aimed at
9- to 12-year olds and has youngsters as hosts.</LD>
<TE>   "Kids ask questions and then look for answers on their own,"
Michael, one of the first-name-only hosts, explained in the initial
episode, which premiered last Sunday on KCET.  The show elicits
science questions from kids, and producers then film kids carrying
out experiments that often are based on vigorous activities such as
martial arts, kayaking and rock climbing.</TE>
<TE>   The photography is slick, the editing fast, the music current. In
the first show, youngsters tried to find out why so many boulders are
in whitewater rapids, how a whale is weighed and how to get more
power behind a taekwondo kick.</TE>
<TE>   Dragonfly magazine is the model. Now distributed to 200,000 homes
as an insert in Scientific American's Explorations magazine,
Dragonfly originated as "a magazine for young investigators" and
featured environmental stories written by children.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids are natural investigators, and what they remember is what
they investigate on their own," said Chris Myers, the former
editor-in-chief of Dragonfly. "Kids see the world in much different
ways than adults do."</TE>
<TE>   Myers and the magazine's other creators serve as advisors to
"Dragonfly TV" and prepare a teaching guide for each program.
Teachers are encouraged to tape the shows and replay them for
students. Discussion guides will be distributed to classrooms by the
National Science Teachers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "Teachers are crying out for science programs they can use in
their classrooms, programs that kids will actually watch," said Gerry
Wheeler, the group's executive director. "'Dragonfly TV' packages
good science in a way that really appeals to kids."</TE>
<TE>   "DragonflyTV" can be seen Sundays at 8 a.m. on KCET-TV.</TE>

<HD>'London Sounds' Listens In on the City</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>from Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Bicycle wheels on a canal towpath, the hiss of a bus door, a voice
intoning "mind the gap"--quick, where are you?</LD>
<LD>   According to musician Peter Cusack, the noises form part of the
distinctive soundscape of Britain's capital city. They are included
on "Your Favorite London Sounds," an aural collage that has inspired
Londoners to close their eyes and listen to their city.</LD>
<LD>   Cusack, who compiled the compact disc, says we may not talk much
about sounds, but we hear more than we realize.</LD>
<TE>   "One part of the world sounds a lot different from another part of
the world," he said. "On the London Underground, the way the 'mind
the gap' echoes down the tunnel comes to you in such a London way,
you can't fail to know where you are when you hear it.</TE>
<TE>   "Similarly in Manhattan, the way the sounds echo round the
skyscrapers and up and down the streets--a police siren in New York
sounds only like it can in New York."</TE>
<TE>   The sounds include a busy street market, birds in a park, trains,
taxis and traffic.</TE>
<TE>   It may not sound like interesting listening, but the CD has evoked
enthusiastic reviews, newspaper articles and radio discussions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's had far more interest than any of my musical work has ever
had," said Cusack, an improvisational guitarist and bouzouki player.</TE>

<LD>Patrick Goldstein does a disservice to himself by acting as an
apologist for the egregious factual inaccuracies in "A Beautiful
Mind" ("Playing 'Mind' Games," Jan. 22). He writes, "I don't hear
anyone complaining that 'Black Hawk Down' has recast the military's
1993 debacle in Somalia as a triumph of soldierly fortitude."</LD>
<LD>   "Black Hawk Down" is very accurate and faithfully adapted from
Mark Bowden's nonfiction book. Almost every major and minor incident
that occurs in the movie occurs in the book. The same cannot be said
for "A Beautiful Mind."</LD>
<LD>   While I enjoyed "A Beautiful Mind" in strictly aesthetic terms,
almost everything about that movie is a fraud, from the disingenuous
ad campaign to the movie itself. The makers of "A Beautiful Mind"
have foisted a canard upon the American public under the guise of a
"true story" and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so.</LD>
<TE>   JEFF JOHNSON</TE>
<TE>   Culver City</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So "A Beautiful Mind's" screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman, admits "most
of the things that happen in the movie didn't happen in John's life."
And biographer Sylvia Nasar's book is, as she admits, secondhand
accounts and no direct interviews with John Nash himself.</TE>
<TE>   I hope that Goldsman and Nasar are available to tackle my life
story--they'd no doubt make it more interesting than it really is.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the film should have been called "A Beautiful Snow Job."</TE>
<TE>   MICHAEL ROUSH</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There will never be a film that runs for two hours, give or take,
that can cover everything in the life of a 73-year-old man. I think
Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman are to be applauded for knowing what
was important and what wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   I have talked to about 10 people who have seen the film and all
came away moved and inspired. What was particularly touching to me
was that at both showings that I attended, men were crying. The
filmmakers got to the heart of the story--the journey from genius to
madness and back, with the help of friends, family and personal will.</TE>
<TE>   LOIS STEINBERG</TE>
<TE>   Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was intrigued by the conclusion Goldstein reached in his recent
article: "After all this country has been through in the last few
months, we've got a serious craving for heroes."</TE>
<TE>   I couldn't agree more, but there are lots of heroes to make films
about. The list of heroes increased appreciably, unfortunately, in
the wake of the events of Sept. 11, 2001. Why, then, must Hollywood
cobble together a story that makes a hero of someone whose life has
been, evidenced by the film's omissions and American ideals
concerning heroism, decidedly unheroic?</TE>
<TE>   CHRISTOPHER STUART</TE>
<TE>   Paradise Valley, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The subtext of Ron Howard's comment that Nash's implied
homosexuality "wasn't central to his life" as a reason for its
exclusion in "A Beautiful Mind" is troublesome.</TE>
<TE>   Sorry, but only a heterosexual would say that. How about turning
it around and having some powerful director state that his main
character's "implied heterosexuality" is not central to his life.
People would be scratching their heads thinking it was a non
sequitur.</TE>
<TE>   LARI PITTMAN</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I, for one, don't find anything wrong in Ron Howard and Brian
Grazer's decision to omit John Forbes Nash's alleged homosexuality in
Hollywood's film version of his life.</TE>
<TE>   First and foremost, Patrick Goldstein indicates Nash adamantly
denies his homosexuality. For once, isn't it great that Hollywood
decided to respect the feelings of the person whose life experiences
are being exploited for money and the possibility of Oscar glory?</TE>
<TE>   Secondly, as many of us in the gay community know, gay men of
Nash's generation lived in a time when being gay might have been
worse than being a Communist. Why push the subject on a 73-year-old
survivor of schizophrenia? Hasn't he paid his dues already?</TE>
<TE>   And finally, let's be honest on the reasons for making this film.
Was it really to pay tribute to Nash's accomplishments? Maybe. Was it
to better inform the public about the lives of schizophrenics?
Probably not. More likely, this seemed like the perfect vehicle for
Ron Howard to finally get his long-desired Oscar glory. And you know
what? There is nothing wrong with tailor-making a film simply to win
best picture of the year.</TE>

<TE>   Globe Dissatisfaction</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the Golden Globe Awards, who was responsible for
counting the votes for the Hollywood Foreign Press--Arthur Andersen?
Particularly in the television categories, something went wrong
somewhere. I think some funny shredding happened with the "real"
ballots!</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't seem at all possible that people like Rachel Griffiths
won over Allison Janney or Megan Mullally. Charlie Sheen beat out
such fine acting talents as Eric McCormick, Kelsey Grammer or Tom
Cavanagh? Jennifer Garner won instead of Sela Ward or Amy Brenneman?
There must be a mistake!</TE>
<TE>   BARBARA KAYE</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   I watched the Golden Globes ceremony on Sunday, and I was most
disappointed. Considering the tragedy in New York on Sept. 11, don't
you think it would have been in good taste to mention the relief
efforts, clean-ups of the site or the heroes? Taking out five minutes
of the air-kissing or self-congratulations would not have hurt the
ratings!</TE>

<TE>   Steppling's Vision Needed</TE>
<TE>   The typical dead-end workshop treatment of the sort accorded
playwright John Steppling by the Mark Taper Forum's New Works
Festival ("All Bite, Wherever He Is," by Don Shirley, Jan. 13) is
particularly pitiful when weighed against Gordon Davidson's
lackluster record of late in taking real risks on any new work.</TE>
<TE>   Even more insulting is producing director Robert Egan's gratuitous
fear of Steppling's work getting "swallowed or damaged by an 800-seat
venue like the Taper."</TE>
<TE>   I recall Steppling's somewhat difficult, prickly and rather
haunting "The Dream Coast" when presented by Taper, Too in 1986. For
a writer of such stark, uncompromising vision, the indifference he
faces in his hometown is a shame. Maybe Steppling should turn his
attention to deconstructing Golden Age musicals.</TE>

<TE>   Punch Counterpunch</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Snow's Jan. 21 Counterpunch article ("No C-SPAN Is Bad News
for L.A. Viewers") bemoaning Adelphia Cable's decision to stop airing
the C-SPAN channel during prime time is understandable if you are a
C-SPAN fan. But to also claim that Adelphia Cable is partners in a
Los Angeles-wide conspiracy that threatens a "well-informed
citizenry" is nothing short of ludicrous.</TE>
<TE>   Those of us who are able to receive Adelphia Cable know first-hand
that no broadcaster throughout the Southern California media market
(and most likely throughout California) airs more public-service
programs than Adelphia. Ask any candidate who has ever run for public
office within the viewership of Adelphia, be it for city council,
district attorney or governor of the state, and they will tell you
that Adelphia was the sole TV channel to sponsor a candidates debate,
then repeatedly broadcast the individual debates to achieve maximum
viewership.</TE>
<TE>   I hope Adelphia Cable will be able in the near future to again
show the C-SPAN channel in prime time, but meanwhile I'll be thankful
for the outstanding public-service programs it is currently
delivering to my home.</TE>

<TE>   Radio Repeats</TE>
<TE>   In regard to the Jan. 21 article about female rock artists and
KROQ-FM ("It's a Man's World at KROQ"), I think Kathleen Craughwell
missed the boat entirely in that radio stations are guilty of a far
greater travesty: playing endless repeats.</TE>
<TE>   At any given time, one can tune into KLOS, KRTH, Arrow 93.1, KIIS,
KOST, KROQ, etc., and hear the same awful repeats over and over and
over and over and over and over again. The real shame of this madness
is that there is so much good music to be played from the '20s, '30s,
'40s, '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s and '90s that is not ever played. What
we hear continually from major L.A. radio stations is a tired,
sickening playlist prepared by corporate executives whose No. 1
priority is revenue from advertisements and Top 40 playlists from
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   BRIAN HUNTING</TE>

<TE>   L.A. Behind on Hip</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Gaslin's "Where the Fringe Is the Middle of the Road" (Jan.
24) would have been more aptly titled "Where the Middle of the Road
Is Fringe." Once again, we are all subjected to arrogant, ignorant,
boring rhetoric on L.A.'s avant-garbage.</TE>
<TE>   "Melrose in its heyday, the '80s, when punk rock and cheap
thrifting were new ... " and "Now the rest of the world has finally
caught up to Melrose" are perfect examples of L.A.'s folly. Even
"That '80s Show" was quick to point out that in the '80s, not only
was punk dead, it was retro. Cheap thrifting new in the '80s? Perhaps
if the rest of the world in this case excludes anything outside of
U.S. borders, with NYC as the exception (heck, even Akron, Ohio, beat
L.A. to the new scene), then Gaslin may have had a point.</TE>
<TE>   If outdated, outmoded, trying-far-too-hard teenagers airing their
bums to passing traffic is what passes for hip these days, then
perhaps the rest of us do, in fact, have a lot of catching up to do.
To compare Melrose to Kings Road in London is so laughable that we
who buried punk before Melrose sported its first Mohican will forgive
Gaslin his ignorance, in exchange for a hearty guffaw and perhaps an
old pair of Vivienne Westwood's Bondage Pants (circa '70s).</TE>

<HD>Kirven's Program Gets Hung Up on Appearances</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clothes, or the lack thereof, may make the man, but not the
choreographer. Jack Kirven, in his solo dance program "Icon" at
Highways Performance Space on Thursday, could definitely move, when
he wasn't spending time peeling off or putting on briefs, unitard,
thong or leather chaps.</LD>
<LD>   A master's candidate in dance at UCLA, Kirven seemed to take
several choreographic cues from L.A.'s Michael Mizerany (contorted
yoga moves, self-flagellation and arched back gesturing), but
ultimately proved naive in his conceptualizations. "Bull," a
three-part, 50-minute opus, proved tedious and overly literal, with
the first part, "Minotaur," highlighted by a plethora of snorts set
to Debussy's "Afternoon of a Faun," and "Ferdinand," in which
Kirven's benign beast writhed to Ravel's "Bolero." Finally, "And I
Can Be Your Cowboy" saw Kirven strip and preen to the music of
Madonna.</LD>
<LD>   "P-175," a section of the German penal code used by the Nazis to
justify the murder of half a million gay people, completed the
program. Performed as three scenes, the work had no ostensible
connection to the doctrine, as Kirven donned fishnet top, fanged
rubber mask and long black wig, all the while reciting a poem about
loving a man.</LD>
<TE>   When Kirven stealthily leaped, turned, or allowed himself
unadulterated movement, he showed promise. Those moments, however,
were too few and far between.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Kirven in "Icon," repeats tonight at 8:30, Highways
Performance Space, 1651 18th St., Santa Monica, (310) 315-1459. $15.</TE>

<TE>   Fender, Daughter Stable After Kidney Surgeries</TE>
<TE>   Musician Freddy Fender, 64, was in stable condition after a
successful kidney transplant on Thursday. He had undergone dialysis
for more than a year before receiving the organ from his 21-year-old
daughter, Marla Huerta Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   The award-winning singer-songwriter is expected to stay at
University Hospital in San Antonio for up to a week. Dr. Ken
Washburn, one of the surgeons, said diabetes could be responsible for
Fender's kidney failure.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia was reported to be in good condition and was expected to be
released this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Fender, whose real name is Baldemar Huerta, is expected to attend
the Grammys on Feb. 27, where he's nominated for best Latin pop album
for "La Musica de Baldemar Huerta."</TE>

colon cancer on Friday. He'll be treated at USC's Norris Cancer
Center, where he underwent prostate cancer surgery in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   George, 70, says the station will air highlights from past shows
during his absence. He hopes to return to the six-night-a-week

<TE>   Other than brain surgery after a fall five years ago, a serious
automobile accident and a dislocated ankle, George quipped, he's "in
great health."</TE>

<HD>Searching for Feeling in Morris' New 'V'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES DANCE CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Extraordinarily clever but fundamentally soulless, Mark Morris'
newest large-scale creation provides a comprehensive index of his
current capabilities and limitations as a mid-career modern dance
master.</LD>
<LD>   Titled "V" and set--with plenty of V-shaped group formations--to
Robert Schumann's Quintet in E flat, for piano and strings, the
ensemble piece received its local premiere on Tuesday, performed by
the Mark Morris Dance Group at the Irvine Barclay Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   As usual, Morris laboriously diagramed the score, with recurring
dance motifs exactly matching repetitions in the music. But, happily,
his deployment of 14 dancers adroitly varied his effects, with many
of the repetitions going to different forces--to groups of men and
then to women, for instance, or to dancers wearing sky blue (with
bare legs) versus dancers in pale lime (with bare arms).</LD>
<TE>   The first sudden color switch between the blues and the greens
proved an exhilarating coup de theatre, and the onward rush of the
piece continually camouflaged how arbitrary Morris' motifs seemed. In
the opening section, an overload of people swooning forward as others
swooned backward and trios that formed and  dissolved looked
especially stale.</TE>
<TE>   Later came an extended crawling sequence, with dancers
periodically rising up to walk slowly away. Again, the movement
itself proved less interesting than the way Morris highlighted Martin
Pakledinaz's contrasting costumes, and as the spatial field
continually shifted and groups combined, Morris' ingenuity and the
dancers' energy almost made you forget the big chill the choreography
imposed on Schumann's deeply emotional music.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through, Julie Worden danced with Bradon McDonald, but
their partnership never heated up enough to achieve the sense of
communion that is the glory of the duets within George Balanchine's
formal music visualizations, the obvious model here.</TE>
<TE>   So when duets popped out all over the stage, and the dancers
hugged one another madly in the finale, all the embraces seemed just
another imposed motif. When it came to real feeling, "V" stood for
vacancy.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, the program contained a number of superior earlier
works. Danced strongly by Lauren Grant, the 1983 solo "Bijoux" (to
Satie) displayed exactly the fresh, inventive movement ideas that "V"
lacked, just as the 1994 dance drama "The Office" (to Dvorak)  found
emotional weight in both its folk dance vocabulary and in narrative
metaphor: people being summoned into an office, one by one, and never
returning.</TE>
<TE>   Morris has always remained unbeatable at whimsy, and both his 2001
solo "Peccadillos" (to Satie) and his 1998 group romp "Dancing
Honeymoon" (to pop songs of the 1920s and '30s) exploited gestural
foolery and a playful, childlike animation with unfailing skill.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the hand-flicks that Morris executed in "Peccadillos"
recurred in the "V" scherzo, and passages in his solo that depicted
his declining strength and fear of the world pressing in also
suggested the possibility of an unpredictable new mix of the serious
and comic Morris. That would be welcome from an artist who can
manipulate dancers and audiences brilliantly but often nowadays
appears to forget why.</TE>
<TE>   Whether playing a toy piano for "Peccadillos" or leading Lisa Lee,
Andrea Schultz, Jessica Troy and Wolfram Koessel in the Schumann
quintet, Ethan Iverson justified Morris' insistence on live music
with great care and proficiency. Eileen Clark managed not only to
interpret the briefest "Bijoux" songs artfully but to sound stylish
even in the silliest "Dancing Honeymoon" ditties. Stefan Schatz
contributed that work's ricky-tick percussion.</TE>

<HD>'Sister's Keeper' Has Its Own Mind</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With "A Beautiful Mind" garnering so much acclaim for its portrayal
of mental illness, it might be easy to overlook "My Sister's Keeper"
as more of the same. But that would be a mistake.</LD>
<LD>   This Hallmark Hall of Fame production (Sunday at 9 p.m., CBS)
tells the true story of Christine (Kathy Bates) and Judy (Elizabeth
Perkins), sisters whose journey of discovery and reconciliation has
the feel of quirky realism, not schmaltz.</LD>
<LD>   Christine was diagnosed with schizophrenia as a child and now
manic depression; Judy has fled their hometown to New York City,
burying herself in work at an art magazine and avoiding
relationships--with her big sister and otherwise.</LD>
<TE>   When their mother (Lynn Redgrave) dies, they struggle with
conflicting emotions: Christine needs her sister's love and care more
than ever but resents interference in her life, while the
guilt-ridden Judy longs for a renewed bond as well but fears an
overwhelming relationship. Judy also finally has her eye on Harvey
(Clark Gregg), the smoothie who works down the hall.</TE>
<TE>   Bates conveys the pain and unpredictable rhythms of Christine's
bipolar condition, but also a tender dignity, such as when she softly
sings "Sweet and Low" to her ailing mom or leads a neighbor boy in a
doo-wop duet of "Duke of Earl." Perkins is also at her best as the
tightly wound Felix-type in this sibling odd couple, and so is a
chilly Redgrave as a source of Judy's guilt ("I want you to be free,"
she tells her. "One of us should have a life").</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Ron Lagomarsino from a script by Susan Tarr (based on
Margaret Moorman's memoir), this film explores the "beautiful mind"
of an ordinary person rather than a genius, and the redemptive love
of a sibling rather than a spouse. But it's no less compelling.</TE>

<HD>Tori Enters, Stage Left</HD>
<DH>Tori Spelling, she of TV's most famous ZIP Code, moves to
the stage and welcomes the challenge. 'I was like, wow, how could any
actor pass this up?'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tori Spelling is making her professional stage debut.</LD>
<LD>   Quit waiting for the punch line. The actress best known for
spending a decade in high school on "Beverly Hills 90210," produced
by her dad, Aaron Spelling, is starring in "Maybe Baby, It's You" at
the Coronet Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe Baby, It's You," about the agony and the ecstasy of
searching for a soul mate, was written by Charlie Shanian and Shari
Simpson, for themselves. The two-character show, comprising 11 skits,
opened in New York in 1999 and at the Coronet in November, starring
Shanian and Simpson. But Simpson, recently married, decided to move
back to New York to be with her husband.</LD>
<TE>   Enter Victoria Davey Spelling.</TE>
<TE>   This television actress, Hollywood royalty by birth, has the
audacity to attempt theat-ah, albeit in a show that makes no pretense
of being Shakespeare. And while this would seem to demand an apology
of some kind to the Serious Acting Community, here is Spelling,
friendly as a new puppy, breathlessly relating how much fun it is to
do this show, to get to play all those characters, to dance and sing
and run up and down the aisles.</TE>
<TE>   "I was like, wow, how could any actor pass this up?" Spelling
bubbles. "There were a few other actresses that came to see it before
it was offered, who said, wow, it's wonderful, but it's just too
intimidating to get up there and do all those characters. I thought,
God, that's what you strive for as an actor, to be challenged. Who
cares if you fail? Take that on; do yourself a favor. See what you
can do with it."</TE>
<TE>   Spelling can't understand why anyone should want to stop her from
having such a good time. If Daddy got her her first gig, so what? "I
say thank you; it's a blessing," she says happily. "I'm so lucky--I
mean I am, to have him as a father, everything he's done for my
career. People should be happy for me. They should say: 'You're
lucky.'"</TE>
<TE>   And she seems genuinely surprised that they don't, always. "They
want to hear bad before they want to hear good. I don't know what it
is, but it's something," she says, wide-eyed. Then she laughs. "Well
... whatever."</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in blue jeans and gray sweater, Spelling appears
impossibly slender, as if there's no one inside her clothes. Sitting
in a chair in the empty theater, she's thin enough to be able to
cross her legs, at the knee, then cross them again, at the ankle.
Arms get the same twisty, nervous treatment. At times during the
conversation, she appears to have braided herself.</TE>
<TE>   The interview begins with a sad little story.</TE>
<TE>   In the first grade, Tori Spelling was cast as Becky Thatcher in a
school production of "Tom Sawyer." In the second grade, she again won
a lead role: Gretel, in "Hansel and Gretel." But the fact that Tori
got the lead again caused such an uproar among the parents that the
school canceled the show.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was so good, to have gotten the lead two years in a
row, but all the mothers complained so much that they canceled the
play, and there were no more plays for the rest of my elementary
school," recalls Spelling, 28. (She's quick to tell her age, but
that's because some people think the "90210" cast must be 40 by now.)
"I don't remember knowing what it was about, then. At the time, I
remember just thinking they were probably just jealous because I was
so good." She laughs. "But--yeah. It was probably ... that."</TE>
<TE>   During a conversation with Spelling at the Coronet, there's a lot
of talk about that--or it, depending on the sentence: the monster
known best by its ZIP Code.  But the fact that she's perfectly aware
of it renders this monster almost harmless. She laughs in its face,
just as she laughs at losing the breakout role of Gretel, Witch
Hunter. "It's something that's never going to go away, basically,"
she observes. "So I've learned to accept it."</TE>
<TE>   Spelling has appeared in movies: "The House of Yes," "Scary Movie
2" and 1999's "trick", in which she portrayed a talentless actress.
That film was a surprise hit at Sundance. And, even though Spelling
received mixed reviews ("Surprisingly good"--Toronto Star;
"alternately effective and excessive"--Los Angeles Times), there was
a lot of press speculation that a major role in a classy independent
film could launch Spelling to a new level in her career.</TE>
<TE>   But even with her recent film credits, she acknowledges the first
thing anyone sees at an audition is Tori Spelling, 90210. "I have to
really impress them to get them to like me; it has to really be
something out of the ordinary," she says, still smiling.</TE>
<TE>   "Because if it's me, they're going to say it's just another
Hollywood daughter. It's tough out there. You don't want to be
cynical, but I've been dealing with it for 28 years now, and it's
pretty much the truth.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's just given me a stronger backbone, and I just say, 'I'm
doing it, I'm not going to let bad reviews stop me from doing what I
want to do.'"</TE>
<TE>   Spelling isn't expecting bad reviews for "Maybe Baby, It's You."
"The feeling I've had so far is so amazing, I have the feeling that
for the first time in my life, I am using my craft to the best of my
ability. I know I'm good at the role. I've worked very hard, and I'm
confident about my work in this." "Doing this, I feel beautiful and
wonderful every day."</TE>
<TE>   Early reviews--well, at least from her co-star Shanian--have been
good. "I have to say this: She has impressed me with her talent, she
is a natural, she just has taken to the stage," he says. "Luckily,
with both women [Simpson and Spelling], there was that natural spark
called chemistry that occurred between us." She's also fearless,
Shanian adds. "I sometimes get nervous when I have to dance, but
she's like: "That's what I love, that's what I look forward to.' She
loves to be thrown around and tossed in the air."</TE>
<TE>   Although she likes to get crazy onstage, offstage, Spelling
describes herself as shy. She acknowledges that may arise from
spending her adolescence in a fishbowl. "I did '90210' for 10 years,
a long 10 years," she muses. "It was weird, going from teenager to
woman, with all of it being viewed under a microscope by everybody.</TE>
<TE>   "It was difficult, but I have very good morals; my parents raised
my brother [actor Randy Spelling] and me right. I never fell into the
trap of young Hollywood. You read about these young kids from rich
families who got mixed up with drugs, and I just don't understand it.
I came from a wealthy family; I was as exposed to that as anyone, so
it's not like, 'poor them'--please. You have a decision to make."</TE>
<TE>   Spelling, a graduate of Westlake School for Girls in Holmby Hills
(now merged with Harvard School as Harvard-Westlake), adds that
nothing was weirder than dating under a microscope. "Forget about
it!" says Spelling, who lives in Westwood with her pug dog. "You'd
think, here comes a guy who thinks I'm cute, and then he'd be like:
'Aren't you on that show? He wants to talk to me because I'm an
actor, not because he thinks I'm a cute girl, or interesting and
smart. That was always a huge issue for me.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think as you get older, you can immediately decipher
between those and the genuine ones," she says. "People ask why actors
always date actors. Well, it's because they having something in
common, and they don't get judged for doing their job."</TE>
<TE>   Great. Talent morals, and a stable home life with the Spelling
Bunch. But there must be something that pushes her buttons. How about
endless rumors about her extensive plastic surgery?</TE>
<TE>   "That's something I actually don't wish to talk about," she says
politely--then gamely proceeds to talk about it. "I am not the
seventh Jackson!" she exclaims. "I remember when I was 20, and there
was something in the Globe, crazy stuff like, she's had chin
implants, cheek implants, ribs removed--God, head to toe. And a quote
from someone saying: 'I went to high school with her, and she didn't
look anything like this.' And they had a picture of me when I was in
the ninth grade.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought: 'OK, listen, honey. I didn't know how to pluck
eyebrows at that point, I had baby fat on my face, I didn't realize
at that point that you could use bleach in your hair or that the '80s
perm was out. Ever since then, I read things like the Queen of
Plastic Surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't look at myself and say: 'Oh, I'm the prettiest girl.' I
think I'm a fairly normal-looking girl," she adds--laughing, as
usual. "I don't know why anyone would go out of their way to say I've
had all this plastic surgery done, because if I had, I'd probably
look a lot better than I do.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always like: 'How can people misconstrue me?' I'm very
willing to talk about anything, whatever, I'm not guarded; my life's
pretty much an open book. Even though people are always all up into
your business, I haven't been one of those people who won't talk. I'm
still the sucker. I like talking. I like people."</TE>

<LD>The case of Thomas Junta, sentenced this week for involuntary
manslaughter in connection with the death of a youth hockey coach,
brought to the forefront the problems of parental involvement in
youth sports.</LD>
<LD>   Rita Luther spoke with DAVID SENNINGER, a Long Beach architect and
volunteer youth hockey coach with the Marina Cities Hockey Club in
Culver City, about how he deals with parents who behave
inappropriately during a practice or game.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   In my years as a youth hockey coach, I have never had a problem
like the one that tragically took the life of Michael Costin in
Massachusetts. Sure, we've had parents get overly involved in the
game and in most cases we allow them to vent their disapproval and
things usually calm down. If a parent gets too upset, the officials
might eject them or sometimes the management of the rink we are
skating in will ask them to leave and cool off.</TE>
<TE>   Parents will occasionally get upset about how we are coaching or
what is happening on the ice and they usually will voice their
concern--sometimes yelling--but then cool down and the game continues
without a problem.</TE>
<TE>   I have heard of occasions in other leagues where the police have
been called because of an unruly parent, but that situation is rare
and has never happened in my experience as a coach.</TE>
<TE>   I have a rule that parents cannot sit or stand next to the bench
or talk with the kids during practice. We ask them to let the coaches
do the coaching for that hour. In the majority of cases, parents are
very supportive and are involved in a positive way.</TE>
<TE>   Our first concern is the kids' safety on the ice. We emphasize
safety during practice and of course keep a close eye on them during
a game. We have both boys and girls on the same teams and take pride
in the fact that youth hockey teaches young people how to work with
others on a team, how to see something through, how to win and how to
lose. It also teaches them loyalty and helps them hone their
interpersonal skills.</TE>

<HD>Three Cheers for Prince Charles the Parent</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH STANLEY SALAZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As we have learned, Prince Charles, heir to the British throne,
recently faced a problem many parents face: What do you do when you
learn that your teenage child has tried drugs.</LD>
<LD>   What Prince Charles did, after young Prince Harry admitted to
smoking marijuana and drinking illegally, was to send his son to
visit Featherstone Lodge, a drug-abuse treatment program of Phoenix
House in Britain, where he spoke to recovering addicts there.</LD>
<LD>   We say, "Good for you, Charles," because the prince acknowledged
the problem and acted quickly, firmly and reasonably.</LD>
<TE>   At Phoenix House here in Los Angeles, we counsel dozens of worried
parents each month. While we don't suggest that their children spend
time at a rehab center (unless it turns out that treatment is called
for), we do offer the following advice:</TE>
<TE>   Don't panic. Many kids are likely to experiment with marijuana,
and just about every teenager will sneak a drink or two at some
point. If it is no more than experimentation--a once or twice
adventure--that goes no further, chances are you will never know
about it.</TE>
<TE>   But, if signs of drug or alcohol use are clear enough for you to
see, then don't turn a blind eye. Don't respond to adolescent drug
use by denying it.</TE>
<TE>   Be sensibly suspicious. Thoughtful and caring parents are
generally quick to notice changes.</TE>
<TE>   Do your teenage children suddenly have different friends or new
attitudes? Are their grades dropping? Is their personal hygiene not
what it was? Are they spending more time away from home?</TE>
<TE>   If the answers to these questions are "yes," then it's likely that
something is amiss, and you had best find out what that something is.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes parents have misguided reactions based on the drug
involved. If your son or daughter is found out using Ecstasy or
snorting cocaine, you would be certain to take action. But what if
it's "just" marijuana? The advice is the same.</TE>
<TE>   Don't shrug it off.</TE>
<TE>   Smoking pot not only may open a gateway to more dangerous drug
use, but it's pretty potent stuff itself. Today's high-potency
variants have heavy-duty impact, and the effects of marijuana use,
which impair short-term memory, deplete energy and retard maturation,
are particularly harmful for teens.</TE>
<TE>   Among youngsters in residential treatment for substance abuse,
many used nothing stronger than pot.</TE>
<TE>   Keep cool. You have to confront your child, but do it calmly.
Listen to what he or she has to say. If you know your child, you'll
recognize the lies and get to the truth. Be patient and understanding
but, above all, you must remain firm.</TE>
<TE>   Draw a clear line. Your child has to know that drinking and drug
use are forbidden, and you don't care what other children do or other
parents condone.</TE>
<TE>   Your job is to be the parent, not the friend. So, you can't worry
that taking the hard line will cost you the affection of your
offspring.</TE>
<TE>   A warm and gratifying relationship with your child is a reward of
parenthood, not its purpose.</TE>
<TE>   You may find that taking the hard line will help your child deal
with a situation many find uncomfortable. Now, they can pass up pot
with no loss of face, when they explain, "My parents would kill me!"</TE>
<TE>   You don't have to send your child to Phoenix House to meet some
recovering drug abusers. That's appropriate for Prince Charles, who
is the patron of Phoenix House in Great Britain.</TE>
<TE>   But, like him, you must recognize that dealing with drug abuse
effectively means dealing with it candidly, thoughtfully, and firmly.</TE>

<HD>Form and Fill a Housing Fund</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousands of people in Los Angeles live packed in decrepit
apartments, shabby motels, converted garages or cars crammed with
their possessions. Those conditions won't end because of Mayor James
K. Hahn's proposed $100-million housing trust fund, but it's a start.</LD>
<LD>   The mayor's plan now goes to the City Council, which seems likely
to approve it--a decision we applaud. After that, an advisory
committee, appointed by the mayor and including nonprofit housing
advocates--such as Jan Breidenbach, whose Housing LA pushed long and
hard for the fund--will decide how the money is spent.</LD>
<LD>   Here are a couple of ideas: The bulk should be used to produce
low-rent apartments for large and poor and middle-income families,
those having the hardest time finding decent housing in the city.
Money should also go to creating housing that low- and moderate-
income people can buy. This would help bring the city's homeownership
up from 39% of households toward the 66% national average.</LD>
<TE>   Currently the fund has only $10 million, and that balance must get
closer to Hahn's $100-million goal before any groundbreaking begins.
The gap would cause some politicians to dump the issue. Indeed, Hahn
could have backtracked, using the sinking economic picture after
Sept. 11 as an excuse. He didn't. His proposal recognizes the city's
fiscal "challenges and budget shortfalls" and imposes no new fees on
businesses or residents.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, to fill the fund the mayor is counting on increased city
business tax revenues from scofflaws caught paying state taxes while
skipping city fees. He has also proposed shifting federal community
development block grant money from the nonhousing uses preferred by
his predecessor or left unspent. Then there's a 5% increase in the
amount the city's Community Redevelopment Agency sets aside for
housing. Finally, Hahn hopes to be able to chip in property taxes
diverted from community redevelopment areas that no longer exist,
proceeds from the sale of city property, a share of vehicle license
fees that grow with the city's population, and some tobacco
settlement funds. With the mayor putting so much effort into this
plan, council members should be racking their brains to find other
money to pump into the fund, which they should vow to keep full year
after year no matter which way the economy goes.</TE>
<TE>   That first $100 million, after all, will hardly solve the problem,
building perhaps 4,000 affordable units a year if every dollar were
spent on new construction. Los Angeles needs to add 60,280 housing
units by 2005, according to the Southern California Assn. of
Governments, and housing advocates who know their way around garage
dwellings and other unfit housing put the number much higher. Let's
consider the trust fund a good down payment on housing in a city
where far too many families pay their rent or mortgage at the expense
of just about everything else.</TE>

<LD>The definition of "overkill" is the ability of one nation's nuclear
weapons to eradicate another country's population many times over.
Russia and the United States meet that definition in spades. There is
no reason for both of them to move so slowly to reduce their
stockpiles of redundant nuclear weapons.</LD>
<LD>   This month the Pentagon announced it will reduce the number of
operational nuclear warheads from the current 6,000 to 3,800 over the
next five years. However, not all the warheads taken offline will be
destroyed; an unknown number will merely be put in storage. That
represents an unfortunate continuity with the Clinton administration,
which also stored demobilized warheads.</LD>
<LD>   The primary reason for possessing nuclear weapons is retaliation.
Enemies must know that an attack from conventional, biological,
chemical or nuclear arms will be met by a devastating counterattack.</LD>
<TE>   Proponents of storing the weapons rather than destroying them
argue that we never know where a threat will come from and we need
more capability than all other nuclear nations in the world combined:
Russia, China, France, Britain, India, Pakistan, presumably North
Korea and Israel, maybe Iran and Iraq soon. That's overkill on the
overkill.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy's Trident submarines each carry hundreds of nuclear
warheads. With enough submarines at sea, undetectable beneath the
surface, retaliation can be assured. Cutting the number of land- and
air-based missiles would not jeopardize security even when the
Trident fleet is cut from 18 to 14.</TE>
<TE>   Moscow officials understandably are upset that many warheads would
be available for reuse and could be refitted onto missiles, perhaps
within weeks. The U.S. and Russia had been ready to work out an
agreement on mutual reduction of nuclear warheads, which once totaled
more than 20,000. The number has been cut by about half under arms
reduction treaties, a major accomplishment. The planned cut in
deployed U.S. nuclear weapons from the current 6,000 to between 1,700
and 2,000 in 10 years also is movement in the right direction. But
Moscow prefers a binding treaty rather than an informal accord on
parallel reductions.</TE>
<TE>   Washington would do well to listen to Russia's concerns. The
United States has legitimate worries about the security of Russia's
stored nuclear weapons and needs help from Moscow in guarding against
terrorists or unfriendly nations buying or stealing them. Washington
has bought uranium stripped from Russian warheads and used it to fuel
American power plants, a good example of cooperation. Destroying
excess warheads would be a bigger asset to security than storing
them.</TE>

<LD>1. Americans do love their numbers. We have Social Security numbers,
house and apartment numbers, phone, cell and fax numbers, PIN
numbers, employee numbers and pager numbers (with numbered codes). We
like Zip Code numbers so much we're adding four digits. We have
license plate numbers, VIN numbers, prescription numbers, all kinds
of account numbers for banks, insurance, mortgages and credit. We
have student ID numbers now down through junior high, where
old-fashioned letter grades are converted to numbers for averaging to
create a class ranking by, that's right, number. We have driver's
license numbers, lucky numbers and lottery numbers. Highways and many
city streets have numbers. We track movie success by dollar numbers.
Sometimes we get fancy with numbers, as in Super Bowl XXXVI. We have
endless bestseller rankings and Top 10 lists; No. 1 is usually the
best, unless you're scoring an Olympic skater or Bo Derek, who was a
"10."</LD>
<LD>   2. Historians like Daniel Boorstin attribute America's
long-standing numbers penchant to a fundamental, instinctive drive
toward more democratic social rankings over the arbitrary duke, earl
and princess rankings of old monarchical societies.</LD>
<TE>   3. So it probably should not be surprising that California, which
is No. 1 in U.S. population, is finally buckling after 50 years and
giving every interstate and freeway exit its very own number, as well
as keeping the traditional, sometimes confusingly similar street
names. Some folks (sorry, the number is imprecise) bemoan this as a
continuing institutional impersonalization akin to the loss of
telephone exchange names like BUtterfield and OLympic. Most of the
other states have already found a convenience in exit numbers that
match the nearest milepost number. Thus, you know that Exit 48 is 10
miles from Exit 38. This will be especially beneficial for tourists,
some of whom visit California.</TE>
<TE>   4. On California's north-south freeways, exit numbers will start
in the south and tick off how many miles to or from the Mexican
border, in case you're fleeing in one direction or the other. On
east-west freeways the exit numbers will reveal how many miles to or
from the nearest ocean, particularly helpful for surfers and those
fleeing possible tidal waves.</TE>
<TE>   5. By the way, the cost for the 36-month project to change all of
the exit signs along about 5,800 miles of California's controlled-
access freeways will be $30,000,000, which is a lot of numbers in
anyone's checkbook.</TE>

<LD>Re "Enron Refuels Energy Debate," Jan. 22: I guess the politicians
can expect lots of big campaign money to come rolling in from the
energy companies. The big line was that "deregulation would increase
competition, thus lowering the price for the consumer." These
companies are not altruistic organizations out for the public good;
they are huge corporations out to make as much money as they can. So,
obviously, once deregulated, they charged as much as they wanted to
make as much as they could. And they still want it that way. We need
to put reasonable controls on these companies for the services we all
need at a reasonable price. We know they have sappy TV commercials,
but let's remember how they actually do business.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Davison</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Brownstein made some excellent points in his Jan. 21
column, "Public Scrutiny Dries Up Special Interest Cash Flow." In the
final paragraph he pinned blame where it belonged. As it was through
almost all of Bill Clinton's administration, press time was taken up
following scandals drummed up by the Republican leadership that
distracted the press from investigating and disclosing real
influence-peddling problems, the effects of which we suffer today.</TE>
<TE>   While Enron and other corporations were buying special favors from
Congress and the Bush administration, the press was following Rep.
Gary Condit 24 hours a day, then feeding the public repetitious
blather.</TE>
<TE>   I hope Brownstein, in his next column, explains how members of the
public can dig into the roots of special interest scandals and gives
them the wherewithal to publicize what they find. It is the press
that failed the public and the nation.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Regarding Enron: As an ex-Arthur Andersen auditor, corporate
controller and officer, several areas of inquiry and action seem
crystal clear to me.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate executives and managers have probably committed fraud,
along with possibly Enron's auditors, directors and regulators, and
where applicable must be indicted and criminally charged. There is a
need for much tougher legislation and enforcement regarding corporate
executives, directors, auditors, regulators and bankers (especially
regarding corporations with virtually no assets). Tough
campaign-finance reform regarding corporations, national associations
and unions must be passed. Finally, all so-called governmental
planning and legislative writing sessions must be in the "public
record."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, partisan political rhetoric and blame-placing will
result in no substantial actions being taken. Americans will continue
to lose faith in their government and economy. Let's remember that
political power and access often result in what is not done rather
than favors done for clients/contributors.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Let me see if I got this right ("Why Insiders Get Rich, and the
Little Guy Loses," Opinion, Jan. 20). The Republican Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act is vetoed by President Clinton, but
the Republicans override the veto. Enron, Waste Management, Cisco and
Oracle subsequently rip off investors to the tune of a few billion
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Now we expect a government administration headed by George W.
Bush, in bed with Enron, to investigate. Bush has only one agenda, to
rape America and any country that stands in his way.</TE>
<TE>   The whole lot of them should be impeached.</TE>

<TE>   San Juan Capistrano</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Believing the tabloids and the TV, we concluded it was poor Rep.
Condit who benefited most from the distraction of Sept. 11. Then,
after The Times' fine expose around that time of Dick Cheney's cozy
corner wish-list tete-a-tetes with energy industry higher-ups all
last spring, it seemed this man-of-a-thousand-graces (to the
industry) escaped more important examination than the Central Valley
congressman. Now, if the Enron end run gets the treatment it merits,
maybe the vice president's many huckstering faces will be unmasked.</TE>

<LD>"Race, Not Equity, Is Behind the UC System's 4% Rule," by Roger
Arnold (Voices, Jan. 19), could lead readers to the mistaken
conclusion that high-achieving students are being refused admission
to the University of California due to the Eligibility in Local
Context program, our 2-year-old program to admit the highest academic
achievers from each high school. ELC supplements our existing
statewide eligibility criteria rather than replacing them.
High-achieving students from any school who meet our basic,
well-defined academic criteria still will get into the UC. The ELC
program was initiated to expand opportunity to a greater number of
deserving students rather than constrict it.</LD>
<LD>   ELC extends UC eligibility to the top 4% of students in each
participating high school's graduating class, based on their grades
only in UC-required college preparatory courses. High-achieving
students who may have once been overlooked--due to attendance at an
underfunded urban or rural high school or a neglected suburban high
school--will have a clearer path to the UC.</LD>
<TE>   California's best schools produce students with strong academic
records, and the UC will pursue these students as eagerly as before.
However, ELC says to students in all schools that high achievement
will be rewarded. ELC expands opportunities for every student and
strengthens our commitment to California high schools, while keeping
our rigorous standards intact.</TE>

<TE>   The poor little "Erica" whom Arnold evokes so eloquently needs to
step up to the plate and try a little harder. Maybe if she can't cut
it at schools like San Marino or Beverly Hills High she can move
across the railroad tracks to Washington Prep High or Garfield, where
perhaps the educational opportunities are not as rosy but the
competition is equally fierce.</TE>
<TE>   Like a drunk who can't let go of the bottle, Arnold lobbies for
the inclusion of the SAT in a last-ditch effort to save the Ericas of
the world. The SAT scores, just like hyperinflated GPAs over 4.0, are
also relative to the educational opportunities available in the
community. I would like to believe the goal of the UC system is to
educate the professionals of tomorrow and not just those who attend
schools with a "high percentage of high achievers."</TE>
<TE>   The 4% rules sounds like an honest effort to address the disparate
educational opportunities each student must face.</TE>

<LD>Instead of bemoaning the possible breakup of this city, The Times
should be asking why this is happening. In your Jan. 20 editorial, "A
Dangerous Nap," you failed to mention any of the causes that led to
the movement to secede from Los Angeles. One of the major reasons is
the 15 citizens (I can't call them leaders) of our City Council. If
these elected people would do what was in the best interest of our
city, instead of their own futures or their groups' interests, a lot
of the problems we have would be solved.</LD>
<LD>   I haven't decided how I'm going to vote if secession is on the
ballot this November. But I do know this: If the City Council members
would do the job we elected them to do, 46% of the population of this
city wouldn't be thinking of leaving.</LD>

<TE>   It's like a cancer that's spreading. It's called secession and it
was started by some disgruntled and unhappy citizens who are
supposedly not satisfied with Los Angeles government. I see it as
some conspiracy to deliberately break up our city. It's much too
coincidental that three areas of this city want to break away at the
same time.</TE>
<TE>   The reality is that if L.A. is broken up, it will mean that the
new cities will become parasites and suck us of our life's blood in
the form of electric power, water and other services. Whatever
happened to the requirement that a new city must be self-supporting?
If these zealots want their own cities, they must make them
self-supporting, not become parasitic extensions of Los Angeles.</TE>

<TE>   I live in the Valley but I haven't heard from any of the people
(or organizations) pushing for secession. I am really curious to know
who they are, what they do for a living and how they personally will
gain from secession. At the moment, I must assume that they will
profit in some manner, i.e., political power or financial gain. When
I find out what the scheme is, then I will make my decision whether
or not to go along with them. But at the moment I am not convinced.</TE>

<TE>   Your editorial reflects your obvious bias. In addressing us as
"secessionists," as opposed to angry Angelenos, you are contributing
to the divisiveness. For the time being, we are a part of Los
Angeles, an unhappy and often forgotten part, therefore willing to
face the challenges of splitting. I won't address the often-reported
studies showing that the Valley is paying more in taxes than we
receive in services; I feel that those reports speak for themselves.
What we're being told (sold?) is that having a downtown bureaucrat in
the Valley one day a week will make us feel more like a member of the
family. Your grid shows our population at 37% of the city. Need I say
more?</TE>
<TE>   What civic pride can we have by being a part of Los Angeles when
The Times itself rarely finds a restaurant worth reviewing in the
Valley? Our theater productions are given little attention. If you
feel that we should have pride in being a part of Los Angeles, I
suggest you demonstrate some pride in being part of the Valley.
Calling myself an Angeleno isn't worth the price you are asking me to
pay.</TE>

<TE>   The Times is correct to say that Los Angeles must remain unified
to continue as a great city retaining its powerful influence at the
state, federal and global levels. But the secessionists, while wrong
about a civic divorce, are correct in calling for more local
governance. There is a compromise solution: the borough system.</TE>
<TE>   Some civic functions are best handled locally (schools, street
repair), while others are best handled citywide (regional transit,
pollution abatement). For example, the city could be divided into
nine boroughs (Central, Eastside, Northside, Southside, Westside,
Hollywood, Harbor, West and East Valley). Each borough would be
self-governing on local issues but would send representatives to a
citywide council downtown for regional issues. The entire city would
also continue to elect a mayor.</TE>
<TE>   The incredible geographic and cultural diversity of Los Angeles is
a strength. However, diversity should not go so far as to dismember
one of the great cities of the world. "In unity there is strength."</TE>

<LD>Re "Facing Sin in the Ranks," editorial, Jan. 21:</LD>
<LD>   I'd like to suggest that when an institution (in this case, the
Vatican) makes unnatural demands on a human being, there will be
"sins." The man-made stringent rules of celibacy are bound to bring
about abuses. The Catholic Church has not handled this well in the
past, posting priests to yet another parish so these acts can be
continued, thus carrying the process on and on with youngsters. The
church must come to grips with this untenable situation.</LD>
<LD>   Reform is overdue in many ways. The one you mentioned in the
editorial is but one; women as priests is another, and birth control
yet another. The best solution, of course, would be to abolish
celibacy altogether. By doing that, they wouldn't have to deal with
secrets as they do now: confession, writing the new policies in Latin
and quietly publishing in the Holy See's official gazette. Suspicions
would be curbed.</LD>
<TE>   If a crime is committed, there should be an obligation to report
it to civil authorities, even if revealed in confession. Of course,
the rights of the accused must be protected, but the rights of the
victims, our children, are more important than any confession. Who
else gets handled with kid gloves after a confession? This is the
21st century!</TE>
<TE>   Maurine Reedy Ruzek</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Times is not seeing the entire picture when it implies
criticism of the motu proprio (at his own initiative) letter of Pope
John Paul II regarding norms of discipline of clergy involved with
abuse. The letter does not deal with sexual abuse only. It also deals
with sacramental, interdenominational and confidential abuse as well.</TE>
<TE>   The purpose of the procedure is to protect those accused (and the
accusers) from being denied due canonical process within the church.
In cases of sexual abuse the church has either relied on or has been
strongly influenced by local civil procedures for many of its
decisions. While all local diocesan reforms in this area have always
put the victims first in their concerns, some priests have been
defrocked without a canonical process or put on administrative leave
(something unknown in canon law) during the litigation proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   The purpose is not to protect guilty priests but innocent ones who
are victims of a media onslaught. Ironically, while this new
procedure protects the innocent, it also works the other way around.
A priest who is guilty of sexual abuse but has been found innocent in
a civil court by a technicality or default can face canonical
penalties under this system.</TE>
<TE>   In no way will the new canonical rules hinder the civil justice
procedure; rather, one would enhance the other.</TE>

<LD>Isn't it about time that LAX built a services mall in the middle of
the concourses accessible from all the terminals? With the additional
demands for space created by the additional security and the decline
of customers for concessions inside of security, a services mall
makes perfect sense.</LD>
<LD>   It would also service travelers who stay at the hotels along
Century Boulevard and currently don't have any convenient shopping
available. This mall would also be the perfect place for a post
office, pharmacy, shoeshine booth, business center and other
services. For a real L.A. touch, why not add a small multiplex
cinema?</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Make Third Strikes Matter" (editorial, Jan. 22) notes correctly that
proponents believe that this law has caused crime to go down in
California. The problem with this conclusion is simply that there is
no evidence that this legislation has had any impact on crime, in
California or elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   Research has shown that states without such laws on the books have
experienced a drop in crime. More important, all over the country,
those sentenced to prison for the most serious crimes have, in most
cases, decreased, while those sentenced for drug crimes have
skyrocketed, accounting for at least one-third of the increase in
prison sentences during the past couple of decades. Supporters of
this draconian law have not produced any research evidence that shows
its effectiveness, save for vague references that the crime rate has
dropped in California.</LD>
<LD>   At the least, the citizens of California know what is best; that
is, to get rid of this silly legislation and seek alternatives in the
response to crime.</LD>

to me. It was one of the first three-strikes cases in California. And
that creep did not commit a simple petty theft by taking that piece
of pizza; he took it from a group of children at the Redondo Beach
Pier.</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly the kind of robbery that Sara Jane Olson and Emily
Harris are charged with, but as a third strike it was ruled a felony
just the same. A third-strike robbery is a very serious matter.</TE>

<LD>Re "Big Brother Finds Ally in Once-Wary High Tech," Jan. 19: When you
think about it, all the new technology to improve our security is
only as good as the people who operate the equipment. That's why I'm
alarmed when I read that 25% of the screeners nationwide don't have
high school diplomas and 20% aren't citizens of our country--with
both these figures being even higher in California.</LD>
<LD>   But, keeping this in mind, I suppose I shouldn't be bewildered by
the photograph that appeared with this article, showing an employee
at the Fresno airport watching computer images of airline passengers
as they went past the face-recognition camera installed there. The
passenger being screened had a baseball cap on; wouldn't you think
you'd have a better chance at a match if the passenger's full face
was shown--without a hat? Can somebody tell me what happens when a
person who, for religious reasons, is wearing a veil that covers half
her face appears at one of these screening cameras?</LD>

surveillance. In his novel "1984," only Winston Smith and Julia
despise the ever-watching telescreens. The rest of their society is

<LD>One thing we should all recognize is that there can be no
rehabilitation of Afghanistan while there are 8 million to 10 million
land mines planted in the soil of that country. It has been estimated
that the average mine costs about $3 to place underground--and about
$1,000 to remove.</LD>
<LD>   In Afghanistan hundreds of people are killed or maimed every month
by mines. In addition, huge tracts of farmland and villages are
unavailable for any normal kind of development. In the Kashmir, the
Indian army is planting mines on an 1,800-mile border, in a swath
about a mile and a half wide. Farmers there, too, are losing their
acreage and any chance to stay employed.</LD>
<LD>   In America's war on terrorism, we see that mines are not
necessary. Yet the U.S. refuses to sign an international treaty
banning mines. If Afghanistan is ever to be rebuilt, the problem of
the mines already there must be solved.</LD>

<LD>Frank del Olmo ("English Isn't a Second Language on TV," Commentary,
Jan. 20), in writing off Spanish-language TV ("telenovelas, tacky
variety shows and old movies"), is terribly unfair.</LD>
<LD>   I occasionally watch the evening news in Spanish and come away as
well informed on the American news stories of the day--local, state
and national--as I do from English-language TV. Unlike a decade ago,
news directors today give extensive coverage to issues close to the
Latino community: affirmative action, bilingual education,
immigration, the recession. Coverage of last year's Los Angeles
mayoral race was simply top quality.</LD>
<LD>   Del Olmo has it wrong in characterizing the younger
Latino--U.S.-born--generation as preferring "rap videos on MTV or
American football on ESPN to the recycled telenovelas (soap operas)."
This hip, bilingual, bicultural generation, if Americanized, also is
attuned to the cool musical styles from Latin America and their
stars, thanks partly to U.S. Spanish-language TV.</LD>

<LD>Re Al Qaeda detainees at Guantanamo Bay: There was a time when
soldiers were contestants in a game, often with many fatalities, that
were fought for land and other objectives of their civilian leaders.
International agreements provided for considerate treatment of
soldiers taken prisoner and their release when the game was over.</LD>
<LD>   It makes no sense for a country to consider itself bound by such
agreements when the lives of perhaps millions of its noncombatants
are at risk. If weapons of mass destruction exist and may soon be
available to an organization dedicated to killing as many
noncombatants as possible, and if prisoners from that organization
are likely to have information that would be very useful for
preventing such mass killing, any practical means of eliciting that
information are morally justified. I should prefer to avoid torture
if drugs can be effective without torture, but the safety of the
country's noncombatants should be of paramount importance.</LD>
<LD>   This is especially appropriate when the organization to which the
prisoners belong is not a recognized government and has never itself
agreed to be bound by the principles included in the international
agreements.</LD>

<TE>   It seems once again some deceitful human rights groups, eager to
take a cheap shot at the United States, are claiming inhumane
treatment for the prisoners held in Cuba. What we are doing there is
legal, constitutional and proper. These swine have sworn to kill our
soldiers, given the opportunity. The last time we got lax with people
like this, American soldiers were attacked and killed.</TE>
<TE>   I have a solution. Our military will back off and just patrol the
boundaries of the compounds. These human rights activists may then
enter and replace the guards and make all the rules. You can take in
any luxuries and foods you wish, at your own risk of course.
Otherwise, shut up!</TE>

object to the good guys dealing firmly with the bad guys? I'm
bewildered. There are those objecting to chaining and regimenting
vicious human beings who behave like wild, untamed animals. There are
objections to fencing in and compartmentalizing terrorists who plot
to kill enemies in a heartbeat. It's said by some that those
detainees should be treated with more respect and leniency. Those
bleeding hearts are hemorrhaging stupidity.</TE>

<HD>Compelling Overview of Islamic World Covers Middle Ground
Well</HD>
<DH>"The World of Islam," Edited by Don Belt . National
Geographic Society: 288 pages, $22</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES RELIGION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes it seems that wars over Islam are as fierce in the
bookstores as they are on the battlefield. Since the Sept. 11
attacks, books on Islam are hot--and so is debate over the nature of
this faith. Current top sellers are sharply divided in their esteem
of Islam, from Steven Emerson's suspicious "American Jihad: The
Terrorists Living Among Us," to Karen Armstrong's sympathetic "Islam:
A Short History."</LD>
<LD>   Now comes a compelling contribution to the middle ground from the
respected National Geographic Society. "The World of Islam" is a
gorgeous melange of photographs, narratives and maps spanning nearly
a century of reportage from the vast and exotic Islamic lands.
Visually stunning and evocatively written, the book so thoroughly
transports the reader to these ancient lands you can almost smell the
camels, feel the blistering desert heat, hear the cacophony of voices
raised in fervent prayer.</LD>
<LD>   Yet as the articles chronicle the endless clashes over territory,
ideology and faith, you are left with a sense of gloom that such
agonizing history will keep repeating itself, preventing Islamic
civilization from ever rising again to its once fabled heights.</LD>
<TE>   One piece, for instance, spells out a dark prediction for
Afghanistan's future: "Today all Islam is in ominous ferment ...
fights and disputes are still sweeping over Asia. Eventually and
inevitably, Afghanistan must again become the object of rivalry among
big powers that rub shoulders in the East."</TE>
<TE>   The year: 1921.</TE>
<TE>   The book offers 27 articles on Islamic history, culture and faith,
divided into four sections. The first, "First Impressions," presents
early Western chronicles of these then-little-known lands, including
a 1914 peek into a Baghdad harem and a forbidden journey to a Shia
pilgrimage site that ended with the non-Muslim writer being chased
out of town.</TE>
<TE>   The editors did not whitewash these earlier narratives by excising
passages that would now be considered offensive and anachronistic.
Followers of the faith are called "Mohammedans," a term now discarded
as pejorative; the harem women are described as "absolutely
commonplace; some of them even stupid-looking." Preserved in their
original language, the essays offer as fascinating a glimpse into the
evolution of Western reporting on Islam as they do into the faith
itself.</TE>
<TE>   The second section, "The Hinges of History," chronicles the
emergence of the modern Middle East as empires fell and new national
boundaries were drawn in the tumultuous period of 1923 to 1960. Among
other events, the articles look at the creation of Jordan, two years
into the birth of Israel, and the extraordinary exchange of 2 million
Turkish Christians to Greece and Greek Muslims to Turkey in the
aftermath of World War I and the fall of the Turkish Ottoman Empire.</TE>
<TE>   "Islam Rising" is explored in the third section, as the discovery
of oil in the Mideast led to a massive transfer of wealth from
industrialized nations to desert sheikdoms--some of which did not
know what to do with it. One article poignantly chronicles an Abu
Dhabi sheik who was gently pushed out of rule because he had no clue
how to parlay the newfound wealth into better lives for his people
and let stacks of paper bills be destroyed by insects. A firsthand
account of the momentous hajj pilgrimage to Mecca reveals the
enduring power of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   And a 1987 essay on Saudi women, written from the inside by an
American woman once married to a Saudi man, offers an alternative
view to the common image of draconian sexist oppression. Compared to
four decades ago, the author writes, Saudi women have made progress
in acquiring education, professional jobs and the freedom to frolic
publicly even at the beach--albeit all under the veil.</TE>
<TE>   The final section, "Seeds of Conflict," traverses the painful
terrain of struggle that inflames so many Muslims today. In "Who Are
the Palestinians?" veteran foreign correspondent Tad Szulc visits
with them and Israelis and ends with the lament, "In that moment, the
reality sinks in. This is a war between children, all scared of one
another but determined to show their mettle."</TE>
<TE>   In the book's final piece, veteran Afghan correspondent Ed
Girardet writes of a 1989 encounter with a tall, bearded man who
screamed at him, demanded to know why an infidel was in Afghanistan
and threatened to kill him. The man's name, Girardet later found out,
was Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with National Geographic's tradition of stunning
photography, the book offers a range of portraits that capture the
full humanity of Muslims. There is the dreamy young Iranian man
making goo-goo eyes at his betrothed. The startling sight of a
scantily clad female Saudi aerobics instructor. The fierce scowls of
warriors bearing curved swords in older photos and Kalashnikov rifles
in more recent ones. The sea of devout Muslims bowing in unison to
Mecca, even on a train station platform.</TE>
<TE>   Editor Don Belt is careful to include articles from Indonesia, the
world's most populous Muslim country, the Chinese hinterlands and the
smoldering subcontinent of Pakistan, Kashmir and Afghanistan. Still,
some may quibble that the collection predominantly focuses on the
Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   And this is not the book for those wishing an in-depth,
comprehensive overview of Islamic history, philosophy, law, science,
art and faith. For such seekers, "The Oxford History of Islam,"
edited by Georgetown University professor John L. Esposito, has won
wide acclaim.</TE>
<TE>   "The World of Islam," however, is a colorful, accessible and
sweeping collection of works that succeeds in fulfilling National
Geographic's stated mission: to wage a "quiet war on ignorance" about
a people and faith that we can no longer afford not to understand.</TE>

<HD>Where God's House Is for Rent</HD>
<DH>Faithful Central is still wrestling with growing pains
going into its second year as owner of the Forum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a church takes over one of Southern California's biggest
entertainment venues, some things take awhile to translate.</LD>
<LD>   Just ask the leaders of Faithful Central Bible Church, the owners
of the Great Western Forum, about the time they let the "Pledge
Allegiance" music tour rent the arena last year.</LD>
<LD>   In retrospect, says Gerard McCallum, executive vice president for
the church's Forum Enterprises Inc., his first question "should have
been, 'You pledge allegiance to what?' "</LD>
<TE>   McCallum walked into the Forum the night of the concert and
realized he'd rented the hall to rock bands seeped in the
death-and-despair-laden "Goth" style. "Makeup. Dark portrayals.
Everyone was dressed really dark," he said. "Some had horns. I said,
Oooo-K.' "</TE>
<TE>   This is the learning curve McCallum and Bishop Kenneth C. Ulmer
have been following in the 12 months since their 10,000-member
congregation bought the former home of the Los Angeles Lakers and
Kings for $22.5 million from L.A. Arena Co., which also owns Staples
Center.</TE>
<TE>   The move put Faithful Central's Sunday services--which had been
held in three shifts in its old Inglewood location--into one of the
largest houses of worship (17,505 seats) in the country. And it won
the primarily African American church new attention in the ranks of
mega-churches that are trying to blend spirituality with economic
development in minority communities.</TE>
<TE>   More Icons of Lakers</TE>
<TE>   Than Those of the Bible</TE>
<TE>   Walk into the Forum and you are more likely to see icons of its
Laker days than icons of the Bible. The only stained glass comes from
a projection on two white screens. Championship banners and the
retired jerseys of such Laker legends as Magic Johnson and Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar still adorn the rafters.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not buy this place to put a cross on the top and install
stained glass," said Ulmer, a charismatic, exuberant man who took
over Faithful Central in 1982, when its congregation numbered 200.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a passage in the Bible where Jesus said, 'Do business
until I return.' We see that building as part of that mandate."</TE>
<TE>   Business has included renting out the Forum for concerts by the
likes of Elton John, Neil Diamond and Billy Joel. Madonna has used it
for a rehearsal. The USC basketball team plays four games there this
season. Disney On Ice and Ringling Bros. have held performances
there.</TE>
<TE>   The booking business requires the congregation to move back to its
former Inglewood address, a converted warehouse on North Eucalyptus
Street, four times a year: Ice shows simply leave the venue too cold
to have church there the same day, and circus animals present odor
issues.</TE>
<TE>   By keeping the Forum as an entertainment venue, the church creates
jobs, as many as 600 for some events, Ulmer said. Eventually, a
hotel, a conference center and restaurants will be built adjoining
the Forum, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers and Kings left the Forum when Staples Center opened in
1999. At one point, a major housing developer proposed buying and
razing the building.</TE>
<TE>   "Many businesses around the Forum, before we moved in, their
business was down," said parishioner Jack Lightsy, 50, of Carson.
"Now every Sunday, there's 6-, 8-, 9,000 people through supporting
those businesses."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the pastors, the church's business minds and
parishioners adapt to a building designed without the traditional
church demographic in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not enough women's bathrooms," McCallum said. And the
Forum's many stairs and steep aisles make navigating it difficult for
some older parishioners.</TE>
<TE>   Challenge Remains to</TE>
<TE>   Keep Services Intimate</TE>
<TE>   Ulmer, 54, still finds himself wrestling with the best way to make
the services more intimate in such a large venue. Rather than remain
fixed at the pulpit, he strides through the aisles while preaching,
sometimes walking upstairs to the higher-level seats.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's settled in but me, I'm still freaking out," he said
jokingly. "Music, anything that promotes contact and participation,
is done more intentionally here."</TE>
<TE>   Since July, more than 1,500 new members have joined Faithful
Central. Every Sunday, "altar calls" near the end of services invite
new members into the flock. These calls routinely result in more than
100 new members a week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a concern and a challenge," Ulmer said. The theme of change,
which is invoked in scriptures, has become a common sermon topic. The
church is about to divide the congregation into 12 groups--"tribes,"
Ulmer said--to better carry out the teaching, outreach and social
programs of Faithful Central. Members will be organized by the month
of their birth, with a parishioner put in charge of each.</TE>
<TE>   Some members, disenchanted with the idea of worshiping at the
impersonal Forum, have left. One pastor and several hundred members
left to start their own church.</TE>
<TE>   The events that led to the Forum purchase began in early 2000,
when Faithful Central Bible Church rented the arena for several
special days, including Easter. For the first time, the whole
congregation--about 8,000 people then--came together at once. Ulmer
and the pastors mulled over, almost half-jokingly at first, buying
the building. The parishioners in turn, grew excited by the prospect.</TE>
<TE>   The mostly middle-class congregation eventually raised $1 million
in 60 days toward the purchase of the Forum, with a consortium of
lenders funding the loan. Church officials proclaimed it as the first
time a U.S. church had bought such a large sports and entertainment
venue.</TE>
<TE>   Faithful Central has long been involved in efforts to build
affordable housing, feed the homeless and to acquire gospel-oriented
radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   But the Forum deal thrust the church into secular entertainment,
often seen by some as at odds with organized religion.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see a separation between the sacred and the secular,"
Ulmer says. "Jesus said, 'Go into the world.' For a long time, the
church has found a comfortable corner: It's time for churches to come
from behind the stained glass. How can a church touch lives and
change lives if it does not engage and get involved in lives?"</TE>

<LD>   A barnacled back emerged from the blue water, arched and began to
roll back into the ocean followed by an enormous tail. The fluke
fanned the air for a long moment before slipping from view. The
display brought a chorus of oohs and ahs from a boatload of whale
watchers.</LD>
<LD>   It's prime time again for one of the greatest shows in the marine
world: the California gray whale's migration from its feeding grounds
in the frigid Bering Sea to the balmy lagoons of Baja California,
where mothers give birth.</LD>
<TE>   The southbound parade of these leviathans is running a bit late
this year, scientists and whale watchers note.</TE>
<TE>   The grays seem to be lingering in the nutrient-rich waters of the
north, presumably to fatten up before making the round trip of up to
12,000 miles--the longest annual migration of any mammal.</TE>
<TE>   The late migration has been hard on at least one female who bore
her calf too soon, about 1,000 miles too soon.</TE>
<TE>   "The mother was swimming beneath the calf, lifting it up to help
it breathe," said Steph Dutton, who owns Sanctuary Cruises in Moss
Landing, Calif., with his wife, Heidi Tiura. So far this year, he has
spotted four calves born prematurely.</TE>
<TE>   Dutton and Tiura said they watched other pairs that seemed to be
struggling through Monterey Bay and yet appeared determined to press
on to the warmer, saltier and thus more buoyant waters in Baja
California's lagoons and bays.</TE>
<TE>   The modern saga of the California gray whale has been a success
story. Hunted nearly to extinction in the 19th and early 20th
centuries, the gray whale has rebounded to a population of about
26,000, according to the last census.</TE>
<TE>   Surviving gray whales inspired an eco-tourism industry. Whale
watching originated in California in the 1950s. Now boats depart from
nearly every harbor along the state's 1,100-mile coastline. Many are
sportfishing vessels that double as whale-watching boats when fishing
is slow.</TE>
<TE>   As an industry, whale watching has been growing about 12% a year
and has spread to countries around the globe, according to a report
issued last year by the International Fund for Animal Welfare.</TE>
<TE>   Counting related travel and lodging revenue, it has become a
$1-billion a year industry, attracting 9 million participants in 87
countries and territories, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   California remains an industry leader, attracting tourists from
Europe and across the United States to see grays in winter, blues and
humpbacks in summer. And Monterey Bay, former home of an old whaling
station, is still a favorite site for tracking gray whales as they
swim south for the winter and return north in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   "Remember our motto," Tiura shouts to the passengers. "'Whales are
for lookin', not for cookin'."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the boat owners who move from sportfishing to whale
watching, Tiura and Dutton came three years ago from the ranks of
whale-loving activists.</TE>
<TE>   They had spent three years following the gray whales in kayaks as
naturalists for their own organization, In the Path of Giants. But in
1998, they tried to coax Washington state's Makah Indian tribe to
abandon its plan to resume whale hunting after a 70-year lapse.</TE>
<TE>   They were ordered off the reservation in a controversy that
ultimately cost them their research funding. They found themselves
trying to scratch out a living in the whale-watching business.</TE>
<TE>   Both of their boats, a 65-foot power catamaran called the Princess
of Whales, and the 45-foot Sanctuary, were packed on a recent
weekend. Besides the whales, the attraction was a featured speaker,
author Dick Russell, who chronicled the clash with the Makah, along
with nearly every other struggle over gray whales in his 688-page
tome, "Eye of the Whale: Epic Passage from Baja to Siberia."</TE>
<TE>   Russell talked about Japan's desire to resume commercial whaling
and other threats. "We need to talk to our kids about our incredible
oceans and how we need to protect them," he told the passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Whale watching can be hit or miss. Some days, the creatures seem
to surface everywhere, putting on impressive displays, spouting and
breaching for the cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Other days they are nowhere to be found. Last Saturday was one of
those days. Yet the boat caught up with a pod of perhaps 500
dolphins, all churning up the sea.</TE>
<TE>   At any one time, 100 or more of the two-tone gray and cream
dolphins leaped in unison, snatching a breath in midair and plunging
back into the sea. Some gamboled ahead of the boat; others hung back
and drafted in the boat's wake.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday was altogether different. The co-captains, who spent years
tracking whales in their kayaks, easily guided the boat into the path
of the 35-ton mammals.</TE>
<TE>   With Dutton at the helm, Tiura scampered to the highest spot on
the boat--the roof of the bridge--to look for whales.</TE>
<TE>   "You are not our passengers, you are our cohorts in adventure,"
Dutton told all aboard through the public address system. "So scan
the horizon, and if you see a blow, give us a yell."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take long for the shouts to begin. "Straight ahead, 12
o'clock," Tiura said. Dutton nosed the boat toward a couple of
telltale spouts on the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   Soon the boat was surrounded by dozens of whales. Passengers raced
from rail to rail, trying to keep up with the sightings.</TE>
<TE>   Carole Adams, a middle-aged woman in a white canvas hat, started
jumping. "I get so excited when I see the whales," she said. She
became "addicted" to the big lugs, she said, when she visited San
Ignacio Lagoon in Baja and got to kiss a baby gray.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, a whale surfaced next to the boat. Both the passengers
and the whale seemed surprised. It arched its back and dived, its
massive fluke the last thing to slip into the sea.</TE>
<TE>   "If you aren't getting goose bumps, then you are dead," Tiura
shouted from the roof.</TE>
<TE>   For Tiura and Dutton, whale-watching trips
(www.sanctuarycruises.com) are the latest stage of an evolving
activism. Now they are building support for the gentle giants, one
passenger at a time.</TE>
<TE>   "We just get people out near the grays," Tiura said, "and then let
the magic of the whales do the rest."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beryl Brooks, the first black woman promoted to the position of
principal in the Long Beach Unified School District and a longtime
community activist, died in Long Beach on Monday after suffering a
stroke last week. She was 72.</LD>
<LD>   Brooks arrived in Long Beach from Chicago with her late husband,
Joe, in 1958 and quickly established herself as both an educator and
a fixture in the community.</LD>
<LD>   Her first teaching job in Long Beach was at John Muir Elementary
School. In 1971, she became principal of College Intermediate School
(now Butler Elementary), where she led the district's first academic
magnet school.</LD>
<TE>   In the late 1980s, she ran a Saturday school for parents and
students, which received a visit from then-U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston
(D-Calif.).</TE>
<TE>   Brooks later served as principal of William McKinley Elementary
School and Jane Addams Elementary School, where she worked until her
retirement in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   After retiring, she served on the board of a Long Beach campus for
homeless children and was a member of the African American Infant
Health board. She was appointed to the inaugural board of the Public
Corp. for the Arts and was an original board member of the Long Beach
Library Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   A lifetime member of the Long Beach chapter of the National Assn.
for the Advancement of Colored People, Brooks helped found two of the
city's major African American women's organizations. Brooks was
active in the Long Beach Symphony Guild and the First Congregational
Church of Long Beach. An avid collector of African American art, she
served on the Long Beach Museum of Art board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks was born Beryl O'Kelly in Raleigh, N.C., in 1929. Her
father, Berry, founded the first accredited rural high school for
black students in the county. Brooks graduated from O'Kelly High
School, where she later had her first teaching assignment.</TE>
<TE>   She earned her bachelor's degree at Hampton University in Hampton,
Va., a master's degree at Columbia University in New York and a
teaching credential at USC.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks is survived by a nephew, Dr. Oliver Brooks of Long Beach,
and a half brother, Owen White of Raleigh.</TE>
<TE>   The funeral will be at 2 p.m. today at First Congregational
Church, 241 Cedar Ave., Long Beach.</TE>

<HD>Jerry Hulse, 77; Times Travel Editor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry Hulse, the gentleman traveler who introduced millions of
Californians to the wider world through his weekly articles as editor
of the Los Angeles Times Travel section from 1960 through 1991, died
Friday morning of complications after surgery. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   Hulse died at Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank. He
underwent double hernia surgery several days ago, family members
said.</LD>
<LD>   In the course of a career that took him around the world more
times than he could count, on conveyances from cruise ships to the
Concorde, Hulse won honors from admirers ranging from the proprietors
of Gray Line bus tours to French President Francois Mitterrand. And
in the process, travel industry veterans said, Hulse played a crucial
role in the shaping of American thinking about travel.</LD>
<TE>   "The power he had, in other hands, could have been a dreadful
thing," said James Murphy, chairman of Chatsworth-based Brendan
Tours.</TE>
<TE>   "He started at a time when Americans were beginning to use their
passports for the first time," Murphy said. "He could get to the
everyman, and motivate them to travel. And people took his word as
absolute gospel. When we started operating in Ireland in 1973, Jerry
put a little piece in the [Sunday] paper. We took over 3,000
telephone calls on that Monday. All from just a sentence or two."</TE>
<TE>   His peers remembered him as a fastidious researcher, a chronic
worrier, a great lover of the tropics and a writer who suffered
quietly in the creation of prose that seemed graceful and carefree.</TE>
<TE>   Hulse was "a romantic writer, but he was absolutely honest," said
Ed Hogan, who as a pioneer in Hawaiian travel and founder and
chairman of the Westlake Village travel firm Pleasant Holidays dealt
with Hulse over four decades.</TE>
<TE>   "And, like Michener, like Mark Twain, he was a great wordsmith,
like Jim Murray getting you excited about a sport. [Hulse] had that
ability to put you in the ring, so to speak."</TE>
<TE>   In 1970, a Columbia Journalism Review article reported that Hulse
was "widely considered to be the best travel writer in the country."
In 1987, he received the French government's highest award, the
Legion of Honor, for his contributions to the outside world's
understanding of France.</TE>
<TE>   Hulse's most widely admired piece of writing, however, took him
not to an exotic foreign land but to Fort Wayne, Ind. In the early
1970s, Hulse set off on a search for the birth parents of his gravely
ill wife, Jody, who had been adopted. The Hulses, looking for medical
history information that doctors said would be crucial to Jody's
treatment, succeeded, and his wife's life was prolonged. Hulse told
the story in "Jody," a 1976 book that was published in 15 countries
and made into a TV movie. She died in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a butcher, Hulse was born in Grand Junction, Colo., and
moved with his family to Los Angeles when he was 3. He attended North
Hollywood High School.</TE>
<TE>   After Navy service during World War II, he studied at Los Angeles
City College, worked for the now-defunct Valley Times, then joined
the Los Angeles Times as a general-assignment reporter in 1952.</TE>
<TE>   His early assignments included the 1955 opening of Disneyland, and
in 1960, when top editors sought an editor and columnist to lead a
new Sunday travel section, Hulse landed the job.</TE>
<TE>   It was an auspicious time to start. The airline industry had only
recently introduced the wide-bodied jets that made transatlantic
flights affordable for millions of middle-class travelers, and Hawaii
had just received statehood the year before.</TE>
<TE>   When Hulse took over, the nations of Western Europe together
received 861,000 American visitors a year, and Hawaii drew 296,517
visitors annually. By the time he retired, more than 7 million
Americans were visiting Europe yearly, roughly one in seven of them
from California, and more than 6 million were visiting Hawaii,
roughly one in five of them from California.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Hesse, who served as San Francisco Examiner-Chronicle
travel editor from 1963 to 1982, remembered meeting Hulse on her
first trip as a travel writer, at a conference in Indonesia in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   "He was already very famous, and I was so afraid, because I was in
my 20s and meeting all these people," Hesse said. "And he was the
first to come over and say hello. He was just the soul of politeness
and cordiality. He would open doors, and pull out your chair, and
stand up when you came to the table, which among newspaper people is
not necessarily the usual practice."</TE>
<TE>   On later business trips, Hesse recalled, "He would lie on the
beach for an hour in the tropics, and just get absolutely black. And
we would take pictures of him and send them back to The Times and say
that he wasn't working, he was just lying on the beach. But I think
they knew how good he was. They didn't take it seriously."</TE>
<TE>   William F. Thomas, editor of The Times from 1971 to 1989, called
Hulse "a model of rectitude--an honest guy who traveled economy just
so he could tell people how it went." (Until the 1980s, Times policy
allowed reporters to travel first class on trips of 1,000 miles or
more.)</TE>
<TE>   Thomas noted that throughout Hulse's tenure in the job, it was
routine for travel writers at many American newspapers and magazines
to accept complimentary travel and lodging from companies they wrote
about--a practice that Hulse never joined in, because it created the
appearance of a conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Instead Hulse traveled at The Times' expense, often logging
100,000 miles per year.</TE>
<TE>   Along with columnists Jack Smith and Jim Murray, Hulse was among a
handful of writers whose voices endured over decades in The Times.
Smith died in 1996, Murray in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "As a traveler, he was very inquisitive, critical but fair, and
very much a perfectionist and craftsman in writing. He had a
tremendous influence. He really popularized Hawaii," said Jack Adler,
a friend and fellow travel writer for decades.</TE>
<TE>   When Hulse began his travel writing career, "people in the West,
they thought of Vancouver as going abroad," said George Hern, who
served as director of public relations and advertising for the French
Government Tourist Office from 1970 to 1998. "He made them think of
London, of Paris, of Rome."</TE>
<TE>   After his retirement, Hulse divided his time between Los Angeles
and Kauai, where he rented a condominium in the community of Kapaa.
In 1998, he contributed his last piece for the Travel section from
there:</TE>
<TE>   "It is dawn and save for the sound of ocean waves washing beneath
my window, my world is as silent as a shining star," he wrote. "Last
evening it rained so that today the sky is as blue as a young girl's
eyes. All would be well if only that infernal rooster would stop
crowing at midnight."</TE>
<TE>   Hulse is survived by two sons, Richard of Simi Valley and Bo of
Marina del Rey; and two grand-children.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for a memorial service are pending.</TE>

<HD>Robert Nozick, 63; Harvard Political Philosopher Pushed
'Minimal State'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philosopher Robert Nozick, who dazzled liberal and conservative
thinkers alike with his daringly original critique of the welfare
state more than 25 years ago, died of complications from stomach
cancer Wednesday in Cambridge, Mass. He was 63.</LD>
<LD>   Once described as an academic bomb thrower for his ability to
provoke intense discourse on fundamental questions, the Harvard
professor was celebrated for his 1974 book "Anarchy, State and
Utopia." The work won a National Book Award and established Nozick as
a major contemporary philosopher.</LD>
<LD>   As a former liberal who embraced libertarianism, he brought
impressive credentials to the debate over how far government should
go. His imaginative grappling with issues of social justice and
individual rights was conveyed in a style that most critics found
elegant, accessible and frequently funny. "Capitalist acts between
consenting adults" was an oft-quoted line from his audacious defense
of laissez faire economics.</LD>
<TE>   "Individuals have rights, and there are things no persons or group
may do to them" without violating their rights," he wrote. " ... The
fundamental question of political philosophy ... is whether there
should be any state at all."</TE>
<TE>   Nozick built upon 17th century political theorist John Locke's
concept of a "state of nature," in which no government exists and
individuals live in perfect freedom with inalienable rights to life,
liberty and property. Nozick advocated a "minimal state" that would
exist only to provide basic safeguards against assault, theft, fraud
and breach of contract.</TE>
<TE>   Asserting that the modern state was a gross betrayal of this
compact, he opposed such paternalistic laws as those preventing drug
use or mandating the use of seat belts. He viewed taxation as a form
of slavery and urged the demise of all government regulatory agencies
conceived to coerce fair play.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote his treatise in response to a Harvard colleague, John
Rawls, who defended the redistribution of wealth in a best-selling
1971 book, "A Theory of Justice." Rawls argued that individuals
blessed with talent, money or other social advantage should benefit
from their privileges "only on terms that improve the situation of
those who have lost out."</TE>
<TE>   Nozick thought that was egalitarian nonsense. He argued that so
long as individuals arrived at their advantages without making anyone
"worse off," they were morally entitled to enjoy them.</TE>
<TE>   His arguments were so adroit that even critics in left-leaning
publications sung his praise.</TE>
<TE>   "Political philosophers have tended to assume without argument
that justice demands an extensive redistribution of wealth in the
direction of equality," Peter Singer wrote in the New York Review of
Books. "These assumptions may be correct, but after 'Anarchy, State
and Utopia,' they will need to be defended and argued instead of
being taken for granted."</TE>
<TE>   Although his father was a manufacturer, Nozick grew up in
working-class neighborhoods around Brooklyn and attended public
schools there. As a young man of 15 or 16, he unabashedly carried a
copy of Plato's "Republic" around the streets of Brooklyn. "I had
read only some of it and understood less," he once wrote, "but I was
excited by it and knew it was something wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   He studied philosophy at Columbia, earning a bachelor's degree in
1959. His master's and doctorate were obtained at Princeton.</TE>
<TE>   His political conversion occurred there. Already known as a
philosophical genius, Nozick for the first time encountered someone
whose arguments he couldn't demolish: a libertarian capitalist. After
some reflection, the committed socialist, who at Columbia had helped
found a chapter of a group that became the radical Students for a
Democratic Society, embraced an extreme form of libertarianism.</TE>
<TE>   After studying in England on a Fulbright grant and briefly
teaching at Princeton and Rockefeller University in New York, Nozick
joined the philosophy department at Harvard in 1965. Four years later
he became, at 30, one of the youngest philosophers granted tenure
there.</TE>
<TE>   "Anarchy, State and Utopia," his first book, was published when he
was 36. It was endorsed by W.V. Quine, a giant of American analytic
philosophy, as "brilliant and important." Among lay critics, the
notices were just as glowing; Fortune magazine called him "perhaps
the closest thing to a celebrity in the world of philosophy today."</TE>
<TE>   The book, which appeared a year before Margaret Thatcher rose to
head Britain's Conservative Party and six years before Ronald Reagan
took the White House, made Nozick a darling of the New Right.</TE>
<TE>   In later years he mourned the fact that he was most famous for his
earliest work, even though he had moved on, in other well-received
books, to much different philosophical terrain.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1981 book, "Philosophical Explanations," he dared to examine
the perennial questions in philosophy, from the existence of free
will to the meaning of life.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Examined Life," published in 1989, he offered a collection
of 22 essays and short fiction on dying, love and other topics. The
book raised some eyebrows for his second thoughts about some of his
earlier stands.</TE>
<TE>   The libertarianism he once championed now seemed, he wrote,
"seriously inadequate." He reconsidered the idea that enormous family
wealth ought to be passed down through the generations, proposing
instead taxes to ensure that the rich bequeath only the money they
made.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to think," he once told an interviewer, "that the ideal
philosophical argument was to produce words that set up a change in
the listener's brain, so that if he doesn't accept the conclusion, he
dies.... Why should [philosophers] be bludgeoning people like that?
It's not a nice way to behave."</TE>
<TE>   Nozick is survived by his wife, poet Gjertrud Schnackenberg, and

<HD>Orthodox Patriarch Opposes Visit by Pope</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>MOSCOW--The head of the Russian Orthodox Church has repeated his
fierce opposition to a visit to Russia by Pope John Paul, citing
Roman Catholic activity in the region. He said he won't meet the pope
if the pontiff decides to visit.</LD>
<LD>   Patriarch Alexy II said "the Vatican continues to proselytize on
the territories of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, trying to convert
people christened as Orthodox or rooted in Orthodoxy," ITAR-Tass
reported last week.</LD>
<LD>   Just before, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that, as head
of state, he would invite John Paul "any minute" but that the pope
himself wants better relations with Russian Orthodoxy before a visit
occurs.</LD>
<TE>   "Regrettably, that doesn't depend on me," Putin said.</TE>

<HD>Igor Kipnis, 71; Noted Harpsichord Performer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Igor Kipnis, one of the preeminent American harpsichordists and
advocates for the instrument, died Wednesday at his home in
Connecticut. He was 71. He had suffered recently from cancer,
according to the Associated Press.</LD>
<LD>   Son of Alexander Kipnis, a principal bass with the Berlin State
Opera, Igor was born Sept. 27, 1930. His father, although Jewish,
remained an audience favorite during the initial years of the Nazi
era, but for the sake of safety he moved the family to Vienna. They
happened to be touring in Australia when the Nazis took over Austria.</LD>
<LD>   On the eve of World War II, the family relocated to the United
States, where Alexander Kipnis became a leading bass at the
Metropolitan Opera.</LD>
<TE>   Although Igor Kipnis studied piano as a child, he did not set out
to be a musician. He studied social relations at Harvard University,
planning a career in radio, television or the recording industry. He
discovered the harpsichord by accident--as a filler item on a set of
78-rpm records of Edwin Fischer's piano performances of Bach's
"Well-Tempered Clavier." The harpsichordist was Wanda Landowska, and
the filler item was Bach's Second English Suite.</TE>
<TE>   Initially annoyed by the unwanted item, Kipnis soon became
intrigued by the instrument, especially after his parents bought him
a small harpsichord in 1957 "to fool around with," as he wrote in an
autobiographical sketch on the Web site of the agency that managed
his career since late 1999, Marilyn Gilbert Artists Management in
Toronto (www.mgam.com).</TE>
<TE>   Before devoting himself to the harpsichord, Kipnis spent two years
in the Army teaching signal communications, sold books and records at
a Doubleday store in New York City and served as art and editorial
director of Westminster Records.</TE>
<TE>   Essentially teaching himself (with some assistance from
harpsichordist Fernando Valenti), Kipnis sought to increase the
expressive possibilities of the instrument. He made his debut in a
radio broadcast from New York in 1959, initiating what became an
international career that included appearances with major American
and European orchestras.</TE>
<TE>   Kipnis had recording contracts with CBS and Angel, leaving a
legacy of about 80 recordings, including 26 solo albums.</TE>
<TE>   He was host of "The Age of Baroque" on WQXR radio in New York in
the 1960s, and served as a critic and contributing editor at Stereo
Review and the New York Herald Tribune, among other publications.</TE>
<TE>   Kipnis taught at Fairfield University in Connecticut for seven
years, and lectured and gave master classes at many other colleges
and universities, including most recently the Mannes College of Music
in New York. He served as artistic director of the Friends of Music
of Fairfield County, a chamber music series, and for 13 years as
director of the Connecticut Early Music Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Kipnis did not restrict himself to the harpsichord, or to baroque
music. In 1995, he formed a duo with Karen Kushner, a New York
pianist, playing four-hand music. Their first CD, on the Parnassus
Records label, was released in 2000; a second is scheduled for
release by Palatine Recordings this fall. He also played
fortepiano--a precursor of the modern piano--and music by
contemporary classical composers, as well as ragtime and pop.</TE>
<TE>   Kipnis gave recitals with flutist David Shostac--with whom he
recorded the complete Bach flute sonatas for Resort Classics--in
March at Cal State Fullerton and the Harpsichord Center in Brentwood.
He was working with co-author Barry Lenson on a biography of his
father when he died.</TE>
<TE>   Kipnis is survived by his son, Jeremy, of Norwalk, Conn.</TE>

<LD>CHICAGO--The Rev. James M. Childs Jr. will start work Friday as
director of a four-year study of homosexuality ordered last year by
an assembly of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.</LD>
<LD>   The study will produce a sexuality statement and shape policy.
Liberal Lutherans have urged ordination of openly gay pastors and
blessings for same-sex couples.</LD>
<LD>   Childs is a theology and ethics professor and former academic dean
at Trinity Lutheran Seminary in Columbus, Ohio. He will take a leave,
because the job at Chicago church headquarters is full time.</LD>
<TE>   Childs said the process "will be attentive to God's word, open,
fair, rigorous, and as representative and participatory as possible."</TE>

<HD>Berkeley Congregation Plans to Re-Create 17th Century
Temple</HD>
<DH>History: Drawings and photos of the wooden building will be
used to reconstruct a Polish landmark burned by the Nazis in 1942.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGIE MASON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>A gem of Jewish architecture that was lost in the Holocaust could
soon rise again--half a world away from where it originally stood.</LD>
<LD>   The synagogue in Przedborz, Poland, was built in 1636 near the
banks of the Pilica River. From the outside, it looked like a simple
barn, but within the massive front doors was a spectacular sight: a
40-foot vaulted ceiling carved with biblical scenes, an elaborate
pulpit and timbers adorned with jewels.</LD>
<LD>   "It was the most beautiful place, so beautiful I don't think I
paid any attention to the prayers but to the walls and to the
ceiling," said Gina Nirenberg Kimelman, who was just 7 when she went
there with her grandmother. "I came home and I would draw some of
these things."</LD>
<TE>   This is the time that Kimelman prefers to remember: the last
moments before the Nazis arrived in 1942, burned down the synagogue
and killed off the town's Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Now Kimelman, 78, may soon have another chance to sit in that
synagogue, thanks in part to her memories. Congregation Beth Israel
in Berkeley plans to rebuild the synagogue to scale, realizing an
ambition members first had 20 years ago as they discussed replacing
their existing house of worship.</TE>
<TE>   Wooden synagogues once dotted the landscape of Eastern Europe.
Only about 10 are left, and none are in good repair; they are used as
barns or sheds.</TE>
<TE>   The Przedborz synagogue was a Polish treasure. Napoleon is said to
have visited it. Tours stopped there in the 1920s and '30s.
Photographs and architectural drawings of it were hidden during World
War II, and later preserved in the archives in Warsaw.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Berkeley's Wooden Synagogue Committee unearthed the
photos and drawings of the original building, which was remodeled in
1760. They noted that a large wooden Star of David dominated the
outside wall facing the town's center, an unusual feature that showed
how accepted Jews were. Przedborz was 60% Jewish.</TE>
<TE>   Kimelman, one of only four people in the United States known to
remember details of the synagogue, told the committee about the
rainbow of vibrant colors inside the building that the archive photos
fail to capture.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time a wooden synagogue is [being] rebuilt to
house a living, breathing, growing, organic congregation, which is
what makes it so special," said Rabbi S. Yair Silverman of the
Berkeley congregation.</TE>
<TE>   Architects have used the drawings to replicate the original design
and add features for modern use.</TE>
<TE>   "The building burnt in a fire, and we've been hired to rebuild
it," said David Finn, an architect. "It happens to be 60 years later,
and it happens to be in a different place."</TE>
<TE>   Artists from China, Italy, the Czech Republic and Jerusalem will
complete wood carvings and other ornamental work that models the
original structure.</TE>
<TE>   The new structure will replace a modest Orthodox synagogue and
will face the same direction as the Polish temple did.</TE>
<TE>   Beth Israel's congregants have contributed about $2 million for
the project, and the synagogue committee has submitted grant requests
to about 200 organizations seeking the additional $3.5 million
required to build the temple.</TE>
<TE>   Silverman hopes to break ground next fall and complete
construction in a year. People of all religions and cultures will be
encouraged to visit.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Budnitz, a member of the congregation, recently visited
Przedborz. All that remains of the original synagogue is three stairs
that lead down to the river and an old water pump, she said. "I
almost feel like those people are with us and pushing us forward,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Kimelman remembers much about Przedborz, but never returned there
because the memories were too painful. She grew up with her parents
in Lodz, but had a large family in Przedborz, 40 miles south. Nazis
rounded up her grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins and forced
them to dig their own graves. Others in the town were sent to the
Treblinka death camp.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you imagine? Somebody would come and have something against
such a beautiful thing," Kimelman said of the synagogue.</TE>
<TE>   Kimelman was taken from the Lodz ghetto to Auschwitz in 1944. She
was freed a year later when the war ended.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing the synagogue again "will be like something coming back
from the ashes," Kimelman said. "Every time I will go there, I will
see my family there. Me and my grandma just sitting there."</TE>

<HD>Roy Rogers' Saddle Auctioned for $412,500</HD>
<DH>Memorabilia: The late Western star's matching chaps and
spurs are sold for $257,500 to another bidder. Proceeds will help pay
the cowboy's estate tax bill.</DH>

<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under pressure from the Internal Revenue Service to pay an estate tax
bill, the family of the late western star Roy Rogers has auctioned
his prize saddle and 36 other items.</LD>
<LD>   The Jan. 19 auction in Mesa, Ariz., by High Noon Western
Collectibles brought $412,500 for the gold-, silver- and ruby-studded
saddle, and $257,500 from a separate buyer for matching chaps and
spurs, said auctioneer Joseph Sherwood.</LD>
<LD>   He said the buyer of the saddle asked to remain anonymous but
intends it as a Valentine's Day present for his wife.</LD>
<TE>   The saddle is one of five that have been on display at the Roy
Rogers-Dale Evans Museum in Victorville. Son Roy Rogers Jr., known by
the nickname "Dusty," said the one auctioned was "the premiere" in
terms of its jewelry but not the one the star rode in most of his
movies.</TE>
<TE>   The saddle, produced by John McCabe of Hollywood in 1931, cost
$20,000 at the time and took six months for 16 silversmiths to
produce. It contains more than 1,400 ounces of silver, 136 ounces of
gold and 500 rubies.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Rogers, who first saw it at a Rose Parade, purchased it for
$50,000 in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the auction block were a plastic saddle, Dale Evans'
Bohlin saddle, parade boots, the couple's "Nudie's" outfits, hats,
wool jackets, Rogers' favorite bowling shirt and ball, and some movie
posters.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Rogers Jr. declined to say how much was raised at the auction,
but said the proceeds will not pay the entire tax bill of "well over
$1 million."</TE>
<TE>   "Since the museum has over 100,000 items in our possession, we
still have plenty to display," he said. Among the items on display is
Roy Rogers' horse, Trigger, mounted by a taxidermist.</TE>

<HD>Plant Disease May Prompt Quarantine</HD>
<DH>Forests: To save oaks, U.S. could limit the shipping of
nursery products and green waste from 10 counties in Northern and
Central California.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under pressure to take action on a potentially devastating forest
disease in California, the federal government is preparing quarantine
measures that would toughen existing restrictions on nursery
operations and on the movement of green waste in 10 coastal counties.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed federal regulations are stricter than existing state
rules designed to prevent the spread of sudden oak death, which has
killed thousands of oaks and sickened forest shrubs in Northern and
Central California.</LD>
<LD>   It is also possible that the U.S. Department of Agriculture could
impose its quarantine on all of California, rather than just the 10
counties in which the epidemic has been confirmed. Everything from
nursery shipments to firewood sales up and down the state could then
be affected.</LD>
<TE>   California officials are trying to avoid that, worried that a
statewide quarantine would be costly and hard to enforce.</TE>
<TE>   The federal crackdown looms as government agencies struggle to
deal with a disease discovered less than a decade ago. It has claimed
a growing list of forest victims in a widening range along the coast.
Evidence of the disease has recently been detected in redwoods,
although state researchers have not yet confirmed that the trees are
vulnerable to the infection.</TE>
<TE>   California and the federal government have come under criticism
for not taking stronger actions to try to control the epidemic.</TE>
<TE>   Worried that sudden oak death could move into its forests, Canada
last year imposed import restrictions so severe that they have
stopped the shipment of containerized nursery plants from California.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a concern to us," said Shane Sela, forestry specialist for
the western area of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. "At the
present time, there is no regulatory control to prevent movement of
infested material from California to other parts of the U.S. We'd
like to see some interstate controls."</TE>
<TE>   'It's Like Hitting</TE>
<TE>   a Moving Target'</TE>
<TE>   State and federal authorities say they have been hampered by a
shortage of scientific information on the pathogen and the growing
list of plants that carry it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like hitting a moving target," said Jonathan Jones, national
forest pest manager for plant protection and quarantine in the USDA.</TE>
<TE>   His agency expects to issue quarantine regulations within the next
few weeks. Although not yet finalized, they apparently will broaden
the state's rules in a number of ways:</TE>
<TE>   Whereas California now focuses its restrictions on the movement of
plant material from infested areas sprinkled through the 10 counties,
the federal rules would apply to all parts of those counties. That
would increase the number of nurseries subject to inspections and
testing of plants that can carry the disease.</TE>
<TE>   The state now permits the movement of green waste from the
infected counties to mulching facilities elsewhere in California. The
federal regulations would not, raising questions about what some
counties would do with huge quantities of green waste collected under
state recycling laws.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed USDA rules would require the debarking of logs and
firewood before they could be shipped out of infected regions.</TE>
<TE>   As envisioned, the federal quarantine would apply only to those
counties in which the disease has been confirmed, ranging from
Mendocino to Monterey.</TE>
<TE>   But if the state does not rewrite its regulations to conform to
the federal rules, the USDA could slap its restrictions on all of
California.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be terrible," said Robert Falconer, director of
government affairs for the California Assn. of Nurserymen.</TE>
<TE>   Differing Effects</TE>
<TE>   on Nurseries</TE>
<TE>   The impact on wholesale nurseries would vary, he said. The plant
types that have so far been infected with sudden oak death are not
nursery mainstays, but a number of affected species are sold
commercially. They include rhododendrons, coast live oaks, bay laurel
and big leaf maple.</TE>
<TE>   Before a nursery could ship plants of the affected species outside
the quarantined area, the federal regulations would require
inspections. If disease symptoms were found, testing would be
required. The federal restrictions would also cover azaleas; state
rules do not.</TE>
<TE>   Falconer said his group favors a federal quarantine so that a
patchwork of state-by-state regulations does not crop up. But the
group views parts of the proposed federal rules as too restrictive.
"And we're not sure how they're going to do all the inspections," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   State regulators have been meeting with their federal
counterparts, trying to bridge the gap between the two sets of rules.
"I think we would like them to come around to our way of regulating,"
said Nick Condos, senior agricultural biologist for the California
Department of Food and Agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   While federal and state authorities are debating quarantines, a UC
Riverside plant pathologist wonders if any sort of quarantine would
be effective.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Coffey has spent years researching Phytophtora, to which
the sudden oak death pathogen belongs. There are dozens of species of
the fungus-like organism, including one that caused the Irish potato
famine of the 1800s.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's anything like other Phytophtora," he said, "a quarantine
is unlikely to work."</TE>

<LD>Acting on tips from the public, police Friday arrested a 16-year-old
Monrovia girl for allegedly leaving a newborn boy in a trash bin.</LD>
<LD>   Police said they think the girl is the mother of the boy named
"Baby Andrew" by the staff at Huntington Memorial Hospital. The
teenager, whose name was not released because of her age, has been
booked at Juvenile Hall on suspicion of attempted murder and child
endangerment, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The arrest took place on the day Baby Andrew was released from the
hospital. A foster family that took him home plans to adopt him.
However, a member of the child's family might be able to regain
parental rights, said Patty Matesic, director of public affairs for
the Department of Children and Family Services.</LD>
<TE>   After receiving tips, detectives began focusing on the teenage
girl, who lives near where the baby was found, police said.
Detectives interviewed her at the police station, then arrested her.</TE>
<TE>   About 10:50 p.m. Monday, a man taking out his trash heard what he
thought was a kitten. He found the crying, hours-old infant wrapped
in a plastic bag. The child had been dropped into the bin head first,
said Andrea Stradling of Huntington Memorial Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The newborn was treated for skull fractures, hypothermia and
dehydration, Stradling said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tragedy that could have been avoided," Monrovia Police
Chief Joseph Santoro said. Under a new state law, people can leave
babies at hospitals without fear of prosecution.</TE>

<HD>Burnt Remains, Muddled Debris Stymie Coroner</HD>
<DH>Autopsy: Officials cannot tell if Stevenson Ranch man was
shot by officers during gunfight at his home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU and ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An intense fire and the mixing of crime-scene debris by sheriff's
investigators made it impossible to determine what killed James Allen
Beck, who exchanged gunfire with law enforcement officers in August
at his Stevenson Ranch home, coroner's officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Autopsy and forensic reports obtained Friday indicate Beck died
before a fire believed to have been sparked by a tear gas canister
engulfed the house. But because only partial, badly burned remains
were recovered, coroner's officials could not determine whether he
had been shot, according to the reports.</LD>
<LD>   Coroner's officials said they were kept from Beck's remains for
more than 24 hours after the Aug. 31 shootout, while sheriff's
investigators sifted through charred rubble.</LD>
<TE>   "Because of mixing of debris at the scene prior to the arrival of
coroner personnel . . . information was lost," the reports said.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials say Beck shot and killed Deputy Hagop "Jake"
Kuredjian early in the three-hour gunfight. Beck, a former Arcadia
police officer, opened fire after federal agents tried to serve him
with a search warrant, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The coroner's chief of operations, Craig Harvey, said his
investigators were frustrated by the way the Sheriff's Department
handled the crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what information we would have gotten had the scene
not been disturbed," he added. "We would've preferred them not to do
that, but they were doing whatever they felt like they had to do."</TE>
<TE>   Harvey said sheriff's officials insisted that his investigators
work into the night, when daylight is preferable.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Homicide Capt. Frank Merriman said that in hindsight, he
should have suspended the sheriff's search of the rubble until the
coroner's team had finished its job.</TE>
<TE>   "Our insistence of them working into the night violated the
coroner's protocol for that type of recovery," Merriman said. "If we
had it to do over, we would have stopped."</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's investigators called the coroner's office as soon as the
remains were found and gave them access to the site three hours
before nightfall the day after the shootout, Merriman said.</TE>
<TE>   Coroner's and sheriff's officials said they discussed ways to
avoid clashes in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an understanding now that if [coroner's investigators]
need to do something, [sheriff's investigators] will abide by our
needs," Harvey said. "They have agreed to yield to our professional
opinion as to how a scene would be processed, so we can do the best
job we can."</TE>
<TE>   Agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
tried to search Beck's house after neighbors in the upscale Santa
Clarita Valley community told them he was stockpiling weapons and
impersonating a U.S. marshal. Kuredjian was among the deputies called
to the scene after the shooting began.</TE>
<TE>   Kuredjian died from a single gunshot wound in the head.</TE>
<TE>   Beck was identified through a DNA analysis of muscle tissue and
matching DNA from his mother, Harvey said.</TE>
<TE>   The coroner's reports were delayed by the DNA testing, which took
several months.</TE>

<HD>Election Fraud Case Placed in Judge's Hands</HD>
<DH>Compton: After closing arguments, the jurist must decide
whether former Mayor Omar Bradley, who filed the suit, gets another
chance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As closing arguments ended Friday, the question of whether Compton's
last election was flawed enough to be thrown out was turned over to a
judge, who called it one of the most interesting cases in her career.</LD>
<LD>   After 10 weeks of testimony, 85 witnesses and the introduction of
more than 600 exhibits in Los Angeles Superior Court, there is
agreement that more than 140 illegal votes were cast in the June 5
municipal election and that some election procedures were not
followed.</LD>
<LD>   Former Mayor Omar Bradley, who lost his bid for reelection to Eric
Perrodin by 281 votes, alleges in a lawsuit filed in August that
those problems are evidence of willful misconduct severe enough to
justify overturning the election.</LD>
<TE>   The city's attorneys say the incidents were unfortunate and
unrelated mishaps that did not affect the election's outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Judith Chirlin, who will decide the complicated case, called
it "one of the most interesting I've had in 16 1/2 years on the
bench."</TE>
<TE>   Joined in his lawsuit by Melanie Andrews and Frank K. Wheaton, two
unsuccessful council candidates who ran on his slate, Bradley alleges
widespread election fraud. Perrodin and his slate are accused of
"malevolent, intentional acts of deception with significant criminal
consequences."</TE>
<TE>   The suit names Perrodin, City Clerk Charles Davis and incumbent
Councilwomen Leslie Irving and Yvonne Arceneaux, all of whom were
deemed winners of the election.</TE>
<TE>   The scope and variety of allegations led Chirlin to divide the
case into seven "mini-trials." Since November, she has separately
heard evidence on:</TE>
<TE>   * Whether counterfeit ballots were cast.</TE>
<TE>   * Whether improper ordering of candidates' names on the ballot
affected the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   * Whether Perrodin committed offenses that included carrying a gun
into a polling place.</TE>
<TE>   * Whether there was misconduct by voting precinct boards.</TE>
<TE>   * Whether ballots were cast by ineligible voters, including
noncitizens.</TE>
<TE>   * Whether incumbent Arceneaux was a qualified candidate.</TE>
<TE>   * Whether incumbent Irving was involved in an effort to register
noncitizens to vote and other offenses.</TE>
<TE>   After ordering an examination of more than 30,000 ballots in
November, Chirlin found no evidence of counterfeit ballots.</TE>
<TE>   In early January, she ruled that "errors and irregularities" by
voting precinct workers did not affect the outcome of the election.
The judge postponed rulings on the remaining issues until all phases
of the trial were complete.</TE>
<TE>   The pile of evidence that she must consider is formidable. A
ballot-by-ballot examination of several hundred voter signatures
consumed two recent weeks. Eight noncitizens testified Tuesday that
they were urged to register and vote for Irving, and several more
voters were called to court to explain discrepancies in their
handwriting on election materials.</TE>
<TE>   Through his attorney, Bradley and his slate have argued that
Chirlin should consider the cumulative effects of the issues in the
trial's seven phases. Attorney Bradley Hertz urged Chirlin to make a
ruling that would remove the winning slate and install the losing
one.</TE>
<TE>   Wheaton, an attorney who lost to Arceneaux by 1,819 votes, made
his own closing argument. He said Arceneaux was an ineligible
candidate on "that fateful day in Compton," because a voter
registration form she filled out in 1978 was incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   "She should be removed immediately," he said. "In her absence I
would have won by a comfortable margin."</TE>
<TE>   Andrews, who lost to Irving by 531 votes, also made a closing
statement, saying the plaintiff's challenge is "not personal; it's
historical and necessary. This community needs to know that the civil
rights they fought for are real."</TE>
<TE>   They city's attorney said Chirlin cannot overturn the election
unless there is evidence in a single phase that enough misconduct
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "She can't take a little bit of misconduct at a precinct and mix
it with a little bit of illegal voting and say that's enough to
overturn the election," Bruce Gridley said.</TE>
<TE>   Chirlin could also order a special election or allow the June
results to stand.</TE>
<TE>   She is scheduled to deliver a ruling Feb. 8.</TE>

<HD>Park's Eyesores on Way Out</HD>
<DH>Environment: City officials say removal of abandoned oil
rigs, tanks will boost safety at Culver City Park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Culver City officials said goodbye Friday to the abandoned oil rigs
and tanks that have dotted the landscape of a local park.</LD>
<LD>   In a ceremony at Culver City Park, Mayor Edward Wolkowitz thanked
the state Department of Conservation and Bank of America for working
to remove oil production equipment from the park.</LD>
<LD>   "It's taken us 25 years to get here, to say that this park will
never again be where people will drill for oil but will be a place
where children can play," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Culver City acquired the property in 1977, when it consisted of an
oil field and landfill. Today, there are four baseball fields, a
nature trail, a basketball court and skateboard park.</TE>
<TE>   Community members had always considered the wells and rigs
something of an eyesore, but after the company that owned the oil
production field went out of business in 1991, city officials became
increasingly concerned about safety.</TE>
<TE>   The skateboard park, built about two years ago, served as a
catalyst for change, city officials said. Parents wanted a bigger
park, but space was limited because of the oil field.</TE>
<TE>   The location of the skateboard park, directly in front of an
abandoned oil well, was a constant reminder to children and parents.</TE>
<TE>   "It focused the need to finally address this issue," said Chip
Netzel of the city's Human Services Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The abandoned oil field operation included six idle wells and an
associated production facility consisting of storage tanks,
dehydration equipment and shipping lines, remnants of the oil
production that began there in the early 1940s. One idle well is next
to a baseball diamond and another pair are next to a playground and
the skateboard park.</TE>
<TE>   Since May, the Department of Conservation's Division of Oil, Gas
and Geothermal Resources has paid $132,000 to clean up surface
hazards at the site. The work includes dismantling pumping units and
removing tanks. The agency will pay another $216,000 to plug the
wells within several months.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America, which inherited title to the land in 1992, has
agreed to give up its limited rights to use the park for oil
production. Culver City did not pay the bank to relinquish those
rights, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Conservation Department officials said an increasing number of
communities throughout the state have criticized the use of highly
valuable land for oil production.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say with oil wells and oil farms, there is a general
feeling among the community that this land could be better used,"
said Michael J. Kratovil, a supervisor for the Conservation
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, television evangelist and businessman Pat Robertson
abandoned plans to reopen an oil refinery in Santa Fe Springs.
Environmentalists had opposed his plan, and the site is in the
process of being turned into a mixed-used business park.</TE>

<HD>Temple Worker Faces Embezzlement Charges</HD>
<DH>Courts: Former bookkeeper is accused of stealing nearly
$100,000. She supposedly used the funds to aid ailing father.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former bookkeeper at Temple Menorah in Redondo Beach was arraigned
Friday on charges that she stole nearly $100,000 from the synagogue.</LD>
<LD>   Appearing in Torrance Municipal Court, Doina Stanescu, 51, pleaded
not guilty to all the charges.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors say that Stanescu embezzled nearly $100,000 from the
temple during the 18 months she worked there.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors charged her with four counts of forgery--saying she
signed at least four checks to herself--and a count each of
embezzlement and grand theft, all felonies.</TE>
<TE>   Stanescu, who had worked for the synagogue until a few weeks ago,
recently sent a letter to the temple admitting the theft and
explaining that she had been sending the money to cover medical
expenses for her ailing father in Romania, police said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, police said, she appeared tearful and contrite when
she turned herself in at the Redondo Beach police station.</TE>
<TE>   During her arraignment, Stanescu appeared bewildered and asked her
attorney: "What do I do? I have to stay?"</TE>
<TE>   The public defender, John Torelli, noting his client's distress,
asked Judge Thomas R. Sokolov to move up a bail hearing originally
scheduled for Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Stanescu is being held on $20,000 bail at Twin Towers jail in Los
Angeles. Prosecutors have asked that the bail be raised to $150,000.</TE>
<TE>   Sokolov set a hearing for Monday to consider the request.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Stanescu, who was a paid employee and not a
member of the temple, had been gambling in hopes of winning money to
hide the thefts before anyone noticed.</TE>
<TE>   She appeared before the judge Friday in a wheelchair because of a
broken foot, her attorney said.</TE>

<HD>Mining Company Sues L.A. County</HD>
<DH>Litigation: Firm claims supervisors have broken federal
rules by stalling a gravel mine project near Santa Clarita.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A company planning a massive gravel mine near Santa Clarita sued Los
Angeles County on Friday, alleging that local officials have violated
federal rules by delaying the project.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court by Cemex, the parent
company of Azusa-based Transit Mixed Concrete. It seeks to force the
county Board of Supervisors to approve the project and pay
unspecified damages.</LD>
<LD>   The suit contends that the county "has chosen to circumvent
federal law and policy through a pattern of interminable and
unjustified project delays ... under the guise of environmental
review."</LD>
<TE>   In August 2000, the federal Bureau of Land Management approved the
company's plan to extract 78 million tons of gravel and sand from
federal lands in Soledad Canyon, just east of Santa Clarita. However,
the project is still awaiting approval by the county supervisors, who
are scheduled to consider the matter on Feb. 26.</TE>
<TE>   The county board has reviewed the plan three times in a little
over a year.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the project want the supervisors to impose a range of
restrictions that would reduce the mine's effects on air quality,
traffic and wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Mike Antonovich, whose district includes Santa Clarita,
reacted angrily to the suit, saying the county has the right to
impose restrictions above and beyond those set by the federal
government.</TE>
<TE>   "The residents in this community don't have the ability to go to
Washington, D.C., to complain about environmental issues," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Board of Supervisors has the responsibility to address these
environmental issues, [and] this is what the board has done."</TE>
<TE>   Antonovich wants the company to limit truck traffic, provide air
conditioning for schools affected by mining dust and import water for
the project.</TE>
<TE>   Cemex officials declined to comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Federal land management officials have said the county may only
impose "reasonable mitigating measures" on the project.</TE>
<TE>   The suit asks the court to require the county to approve the mine
within 60 days of its ruling, and to prevent the county from imposing
regulations "inconsistent" with those of the Bureau of Land
Management.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the city of Santa Clarita and a Paso Robles
environmental group sued the U.S. Department of the Interior,
claiming it failed to protect several endangered species near the
mine.</TE>
<TE>   Cemex officials have said the Soledad Canyon mine would be a
crucial source of gravel and sand for the local building industry.
They say the mine would comply with anti-dust regulations, avoid
using water during draught conditions and have minimal effects on
traffic.</TE>

<HD>S&amp;P Says It Will Change Its Credit-Rating Process</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standard &amp; Poor's announced plans Friday to revamp its credit-rating
process, as the New York-based agency and its rivals respond to
criticism that they were too slow last fall to downgrade energy
trader Enron Corp., which filed for bankruptcy in December.</LD>
<LD>   "Many of these changes have been underway since last fall,
including publishing commentary more frequently so that the markets
hear from us after routine events such as earnings calls and
management changes," said Clifford Griep, S&amp;P's chief credit officer.
He said forward-looking commentary will help identify "credit cliff
situations," in which the credit-worthiness and rating could decline
precipitously.</LD>
<LD>   S&amp;P, a division of McGraw-Hill Inc., said it plans to make its
rating actions more timely and offer more commentary; explain how
off-balance-sheet activities are incorporated into the rating
process; provide more details on the dangers of third-party financing
falling through; and push for mandatory disclosure of so-called
triggers, increasingly common clauses in financing agreements that
boost a company's borrowing costs after a rating downgrade.</LD>
<TE>   Triggers in Enron's financing arrangements and problems with
off-balance-sheet financing were prominent in its collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Credit ratings, which S&amp;P issues on a scale from AAA to D, affect
the ability of companies to borrow money--and what they pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   In the last week, rivals Moody's Investors Service and Fitch also
said they are considering changes to how they rate companies. And in
the wake of Enron's collapse, companies such as Kmart Corp., which
also has filed for bankruptcy, have found that rating agencies and
bankers are cutting them far less slack.</TE>
<TE>   Bond fund managers said S&amp;P's changes could benefit the credit
market by making available more information, but cautioned that
quicker downgrades could heighten trading volatility.</TE>
<TE>   Some managers expressed concern about a provision of S&amp;P's plan
that would "incorporate security price behavior into its surveillance
process."</TE>
<TE>   "In the long term, I don't see how the rating process becomes more
proactive if it's heavily influenced by stock market pressures," said
John Bender, co-manager of the Strong Corporate Bond Fund. "The
process should be based on business fundamentals rather than equity
market psychology."</TE>

<HD>Investors Are Pushing for Audit Reform</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Pension funds are urging firms not to use same
company as consultant, to avoid conflicts of interest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The demise of once-mighty Enron Corp. is beginning to reverberate
across corporate America as companies come under increasing pressure
from investors to reform their auditing procedures.</LD>
<LD>   In formal requests to about 30 large corporations, several pension
funds have asked them to stop the widespread practice of hiring the
same firm as both an auditor and as an outside consultant.</LD>
<LD>   The pension funds want to eliminate a perceived conflict of
interest that has drawn considerable attention in the Enron debacle.</LD>
<TE>   Critics worry that accountants, in their quest to nab lucrative
consulting work, may overlook questionable corporate accounting to
curry favor with company management.</TE>
<TE>   Enron paid Andersen, its accounting firm, $25 million in auditing
fees in 2000. It paid $27 million for outside consulting services.</TE>
<TE>   Consulting fees far exceed audit charges at many companies,
according to data from the United Brotherhood of Carpenters. Kmart
Corp., for example, pays its accounting firm 10 times as much for
consulting as it does for auditing. At Apple Computer Inc., the ratio
is almost 13 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron's the train wreck," said Ed Durkin, director of special
programs for the carpenters union. "What we're trying to accomplish
is [corporate] governance practices and structures that keep those
train wrecks from happening."</TE>
<TE>   Corporate governance refers to the basic structure by which boards
of directors and top executives operate companies.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate-governance activists say the effort to separate audit
and non-audit work could be the opening salvo in a larger effort to
clean up a variety of perceived conflicts. The proposals are intended
to prevent accountants from becoming too cozy with the companies they
audit.</TE>
<TE>   TIAA-CREF, the world's largest pension-fund manager, is
contemplating a proposal that would force companies to switch
auditing firms every few years, said Ken Bertsch, the fund's
corporate-governance director. Another possible proposal would bar
companies from hiring top managers from their accounting firms. That
would block a revolving door between some companies and accounting
firms.</TE>
<TE>   The pension-fund proposals are in the form of shareholder
resolutions to be voted on by investors at companies' annual
meetings. The resolutions are nonbinding, meaning managements do not
have to comply with them.</TE>
<TE>   Resolutions sponsored by outsiders rarely pass. But sizable
support from shareholders would send an important message, pension
funds say.</TE>
<TE>   "Long term, to oppose those concepts would be very foolish," said
Charles Elson, director of the Center for Corporate Governance at the
University of Delaware.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, companies have opposed most shareholder
resolutions, arguing that they intrude on management decision-making.
Companies routinely ask the Securities and Exchange Commission for
permission to block shareholder votes on the issues, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate-governance activists believe that companies will oppose
the auditor independence resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co., for example, asked the SEC for the right to block
a shareholder vote, said Joyce Mader, an attorney for the mutual fund
sponsoring the proposal. The SEC rejected the request, and the
resolution will be voted on at Disney's meeting Feb. 19.</TE>
<TE>   In the official shareholder ballot, known as a proxy statement,
Disney says it opposes a proposal submitted by a mutual fund
associated with the United Assn. of Plumbers and Pipefitters. Disney
said safeguards are in place to ensure the independence of its
auditor, PriceWaterhouseCoopers.</TE>
<TE>   "There is little chance for abuse and no benefit to the company or
its shareholders from an arbitrary limitation on the power of
management and the board of directors to exercise business judgment,"
Disney contends in the proxy.</TE>
<TE>   A Disney spokeswoman declined to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   Governance activists acknowledge that the resolutions have only so
much impact on company managements, but say they add to the pressure
companies are feeling.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unlikely that companies will actually change their practices
strictly as a result of this proposal," said Carol Bowie, head of
corporate-governance research at the Investor Responsibility Research
Center, an institutional-investor consulting firm. "But it may well
be just one more nail in the coffin of auditor consulting."</TE>

<HD>U.S. May Cancel Enron Contracts</HD>
<DH>Review: The government is looking into whether the energy
trader and Andersen still meet federal ethics standards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS and RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration said Friday that it may suspend or cancel up
to $70million in government contracts awarded to energy giant Enron
Corp. and its auditor, Andersen, if it determines that the companies
no longer meet federal ethics standards.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. comptroller general also announced new restrictions on
consulting work that accounting firms can do for the federal agencies
they audit.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) asked Vice
President Dick Cheney to explain a section of the administration's
energy policy that Waxman said benefited Enron. The section promotes
natural gas development in India, where Enron has an interest in a
natural-gas-fueled power plant.</LD>
<TE>   In a letter Friday, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., director of the
Office of Management and Budget, asked the General Services
Administration to investigate allegations of "document shredding,
manipulative accounting practices and other activities that could
reflect poorly on these corporate entities and their ability to
provide quality work."</TE>
<TE>   Federal agencies that contract work from Enron or Andersen, known
until last year as Arthur Andersen, include the Pentagon, the Justice
Department, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development
and the Treasury Department.</TE>
<TE>   "These agencies should ensure that existing contracts with Arthur
Andersen and Enron are being performed in accordance with contract
terms and proper business practices," Daniels wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Federal rules require that companies doing business with the
government have a satisfactory record of business ethics and
integrity.</TE>
<TE>   Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Dec. 2, less than
a month after the company reported that it had overstated earnings
dating to 1997 by nearly $600million. Questions about its financial
health and questionable accounting practices caused its stock price
to plummet, wiping out the retirement savings of thousands of
employees and costing investors billions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Enron and Andersen each have about $35 million in government
contracts, said OMB spokesman Trent Duffy. The government spends a
total of about $200 billion each year on goods and services.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's work includes auditing, accounting and management
services for government entities including the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services and the State Department, according to the
Federal Procurement Data System, which lists government contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's work includes gas and electric services for the Air Force
and the Justice Department's prison system.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson Slocum of Washington-based advocacy group Public Citizen
called the review of Enron and Andersen contracts "prudent," but he
characterized the move as "damage control" by the White House, which
has been attempting to distance itself from the Enron scandal. The
beleaguered company's former chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, was among
Bush's biggest supporters.</TE>
<TE>   A White House spokeswoman said the decision to review the
contracts was made entirely by the OMB.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton said his company welcomed the
review. "We have an excellent track record of government consulting,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron did not return phone calls Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Waxman, meanwhile, asked Cheney to provide information on how the
administration chose to recommend natural gas development in India.</TE>
<TE>   Waxman and John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), the ranking Democrat on the
House Energy and Commerce Committee, have been pressing Cheney for
months to provide details of private meetings he and his energy task
force held with outside interests while drafting the energy policy.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney has said that he or his task force staff met six times with
Enron representatives last year. But he has declined to provide
additional details, saying it would hinder the free exchange of
ideas.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, Comptroller General David M. Walker, who has
responsibility for setting the audit standards used by government
entities, adopted rules designed to improve the independence of
accounting firms that audit federal agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the rules ban firms from making management
decisions or from selling agencies additional consulting services,
such as bookkeeping, record keeping and, in some cases, payroll
processing.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe this is the right thing to do," said Walker, a former
Andersen partner who has recused himself from any issues related to
his former employer. "There's more interest now because of Enron, but
this is something that has been in the works for three years and
predates Enron."</TE>
<TE>   The rules will not apply to audits of corporations or publicly
traded companies, but lawmakers are debating whether to mandate
similar restrictions in the private sector.</TE>
<TE>   In another development, congressional investigators demanded more
information about Lay's personal loans from the company.</TE>
<TE>   "We are concerned about the unreported nature of these
transactions and their effect upon Enron shareholders and employees,
particularly during the stock's steep decline in 2001," Reps. W.J.
"Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, and Dingell wrote in a letter to Lay.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the more than $200 million in compensation he
received from Enron since 1999, Lay was provided with a revolving
line of credit--$7.5 million last year. The collateral securing the
line of credit apparently was Lay's stock.</TE>
<TE>   From February to October, Lay borrowed money and repaid it 15
times, according to investigators. In each case, he repaid it by
returning stock to Enron. "He appears to have obtained some of those
shares by exercising options, while in other cases he returned shares
he already owned," the letter sent by the lawmakers said.</TE>
<TE>   The committee asked Lay for a detailed listing of all loan
transactions involving himself, Jeffrey K. Skilling, Andrew Fastow,
Michael Kopper, Rick Buy, Rick Causey, and any other senior Enron
executive during 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators asked Lay to also explain the extent to which the
Enron board was made aware of any loans or repayments.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, the White House defended a recommendation made in 1997
by longtime Bush political advisor Karl Rove that an Enron consulting
contract be awarded to Ralph Reed, former executive director of the
Christian Coalition and a prominent GOP strategist.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer called Rove's recommendation
"fairly common and common-sensical."</TE>
<TE>   "Karl Rove gave Ralph Reed a good recommendation, as we all would,
as we all do," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Slocum said the Bush campaign "was able to use Enron as a kind of
campaign tool, where they were able to direct an extremely, extremely
lucrative consulting position for a key ally that would become
crucial in his primary battle."</TE>
<TE>   Reed, who advised Enron on how to generate grass-roots support for
deregulation, said he did not ask Rove for a recommendation. He
stopped working for Enron last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I agreed to support George W. Bush for president because he was a
friend, and I admired him a great deal and thought he would be a
great president. Any suggestion that I supported him for any other
reason is not only untrue but insulting."</TE>

<HD>Home Sales Set Records in 2001</HD>
<DH>Real estate: The market remained strong despite the
recession and Sept. 11 attacks, a report says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite the recession and the devastating effects of Sept. 11, sales
and prices of existing homes in the U.S. rose to record levels last
year, an industry group said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The report by the National Assn. of Realtors attested to the
amazing resilience of U.S. consumers, who have kept snapping up homes
in the face of rising unemployment and weakening business conditions.</LD>
<LD>   Although home sales dipped in December, buyers purchased 5.25
million homes last year, 2.7% more than the previous year. Median
prices of previously owned homes rose an impressive 6.1% to $147,500.</LD>
<TE>   This year, however, sales are expected to decline slightly because
mortgage rates are edging higher and consumers will be unable to
sustain the current buying pace, said David Lereah, the association's
chief economist.</TE>
<TE>   The housing market should remain strong in 2002, "though it will
not be a driving force behind the recovery," said Lynn Reaser, chief
economist at Banc of America Capital Management in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   In California, sales of existing homes fell for the second year in
a row as interest in high-end properties waned in many areas and home
building trailed demand, the California Assn. of Realtors said. A
total of 504,429 homes were sold last year, down 5.7% from 2000, the
L.A.-based trade group said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, prices are expected to hit a record when final figures are
tallied, said Leslie Appleton-Young, the group's chief economist. In
December, the median resale price of a single-family home in
California was $276,940, up 11.5% from the same month a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   A chronic shortage of new housing has boosted overall home prices
throughout the state, she said.</TE>
<TE>   In December, for instance, housing inventory stood at 2.9 months,
about the same as a year ago but less than half the average over the
last decade, Appleton-Young said.</TE>
<TE>   "That housing shortage creates a sense of urgency in the
marketplace," she said.</TE>
<TE>   New-home permits, an indicator of future building, remained flat
statewide last year, with 147,752 permits pulled for single-family
and attached homes, according to the Construction Industry Research
Board, a Burbank firm that tracks real estate trends. The Bay Area,
staggered by the slumping high-technology sector, recorded a 17.9%
decline in permits.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, new-home permits rose 2.8% for the year,
with the Inland Empire accounting for a large chunk of the gain
because of cheaper housing. The number of housing permits in Orange
County slumped 30%, a reflection of robust building the previous
year.</TE>

<HD>ImClone Shares Dip on Inquiry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE RICHTER</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>ImClone Systems Inc. is under investigation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, increasing scrutiny
into whether the biotechnology company misled investors about
prospects for its cancer drug Erbitux.</LD>
<LD>   Since Dec. 28, when ImClone surprised investors by disclosing that
U.S. regulators refused to consider its Erbitux application, the
company's shares have fallen 70%, including a 16% drop Friday after
ImClone disclosed the probes in a regulatory filing.</LD>
<LD>   The House Energy and Commerce Committee started a probe Jan. 18 to
find out whether ImClone hid flaws in company research from investors
and cancer patients while executives, including Chief Executive
Samuel Waksal, were selling their shares. The committee has asked for
documents by Jan. 31 from ImClone, the Food and Drug Administration
and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., which owns 20% of ImClone.</LD>
<TE>   Representatives for ImClone, the SEC and the Justice Department
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of ImClone fell $3.09 to $16.49 on Nasdaq. Bristol-Myers
shares fell 60 cents to $46.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, Peter G. Peterson, chairman of the investment firm
Blackstone Group and former commerce secretary under President Nixon,
resigned from ImClone's board, according to regulatory filings.
Peterson, who also is chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, did not return a call for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The House panel investigating ImClone also is probing the collapse
of energy trader Enron Corp. The panel has put an investigator on the
ImClone probe full time. So far, the committee hasn't scheduled any
hearings on ImClone.</TE>
<TE>   Investors have alleged in a lawsuit that ImClone rushed to file
its Erbitux application with the FDA to receive a cash payment from
Bristol-Myers of $300million.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA gave the application "fast track" status in February 2001,
a designation that sometimes leads to review within six months.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the FDA found the application flawed, according to the
Cancer Letter, a Washington-based newsletter. The FDA had concerns
that some patients didn't meet criteria for participating in the
study, that the firm didn't provide enough information on Erbitux's
side effects and provided explanations for only three of 21 patient
deaths that occurred within 30 days of treatment, the Cancer Letter
said.</TE>

<HD>Letter Alleges Accounting Irregularities at Kmart</HD>
<DH>Probe: Firm says it contacted SEC about anonymous note that
may be from workers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kmart Corp. said Friday that the company and federal regulators are
investigating an anonymous letter that suggests there may have been
corporate accounting irregularities.</LD>
<LD>   Troy, Mich.-based Kmart, which on Tuesday filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection, said it contacted the Securities and Exchange
Commission upon receiving the letter a little more than a week ago.</LD>
<LD>   The company said it has hired accounting firm Deloitte &amp; Touche to
investigate the matter independent of Kmart and its regular auditor,
PricewaterhouseCoopers.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC declined to confirm or deny an investigation or receipt of
the letter, which Kmart said claimed to be from employees and was
addressed to the SEC, Kmart's board of directors and
PricewaterhouseCoopers.</TE>
<TE>   SEC officials, however, told Kmart that they had launched an
investigation and will be requesting company documents, said Kmart
spokesman Jack Ferry.</TE>
<TE>   "The letter doesn't contain any specifics and there's no point in
trying to speculate what was intended," Ferry said. "However, we take
all matters of this nature very seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Suggestions of accounting improprieties are particularly sensitive
after the collapse of Enron Corp., whose executives have been accused
of misleading the public about the company's health by using complex
accounting schemes that eventually cost thousands of employees and
others their retirement savings.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Enron debacle also featured an anonymous letter
alleging improprieties, the note in the Enron case contained specific
allegations and was written to the company's then-chairman, Kenneth
L. Lay. Vice President Sherron S. Watkins later identified herself as
the writer.</TE>
<TE>   "Kmart has inventory, stores and employees, meaning that there's
very little opportunity for the accounting chicanery like the type we
saw in Enron, which had a lot of complex trading assets," said Martin
Zohn, a bankruptcy attorney who specializes in retail reorganization
with the Proskauer Rose law firm in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be like increased vigilance after Sept. 11--now
employees and the public are watching for this kind of accounting
fraud and it may be that they are seeing accounting terrorists where
they don't exist."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts also noted that complaints to the SEC have long been
commonplace, especially when a stock under-performs or a company
reorganizes.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart on Tuesday became the nation's largest retailer to file for
bankruptcy protection, after a poor holiday showing and months of
weak sales that cut the company's cash flow and eroded confidence
among investors, vendors and lenders.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart listed $16.3 billion in assets and $10.3 billion in
liabilities in its bankruptcy petition, and analysts are expecting
that Kmart will close hundreds of under-performing stores and lay off
thousands of its 250,000 employees in a bid to reorganize and compete
with rivals Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart shares dropped 8 cents to close at 85 cents on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Lockheed Records Net Loss for the 4th Quarter</HD>
<DH>Earnings: The defense company takes more than $1billion in
charges to exit the telecom business. It expects '02 results to beat
Wall Street forecasts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lockheed Martin Corp., the biggest defense contractor, on Friday
posted a net loss for the fourth quarter after taking more than
$1billion in charges to exit the telecommunications business.</LD>
<LD>   But the company posted an increased profit on an operating basis
and said results in 2002 will be higher than Wall Street's estimates.</LD>
<LD>   Lockheed reported a net loss of $1.51billion, or $3.49 a share,
contrasted with earnings of $89million, or 21 cents, a year ago. The
loss dragged Lockheed into the red for the full year, despite profit
in the three other quarters. Its 2001 loss of $1.05billion was double
its loss of $519 million in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Wall Street analysts said the net loss was expected and operating
earnings were in line with most expectations, beating the average
estimate.</TE>
<TE>   "The quarter was basically as expected from an operating
standpoint," said Christopher Mecray, analyst at Deutsche Bank Alex.
Brown. Lockheed shares gained 59 cents to close at $50 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "Operationally, 2001 was a year of very solid achievements," said
Robert Stevens, president and chief operating officer. He noted a
number of developments, including winning the F-35 fighter contract
and starting low-rate initial production of the F-22 fighter.</TE>
<TE>   The results for the quarter represented a previously reported loss
from discontinued operations of $3.15 a share for exiting the
telecommunications business, including a $1.3-billion charge.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding items, the company posted operating earnings of 49 cents
a share on a pro forma basis, compared with 38 cents a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Net sales were roughly flat at $7.33billion, compared with
$7.32billion a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The company ended the year with a record backlog of $71.3 billion.
It recorded orders of $40.1 billion, including orders for the F-35
fighter jet, during the year.</TE>
<TE>   For 2002, Lockheed expects to report earnings of $2.45 to $2.50 a
share from continuing operations. Analysts now estimate Lockheed's
2002 earnings at $2.17 a share, according to Thomson Financial/First
Call.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed's fourth-quarter loss was expected on Wall Street after
the company's announcement in December that it would exit the
telecommunications business, selling stakes in mobile satellite
networks such as Intelsat, Inmarsat and New Skies.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Lockheed executives said they are looking into
strategic solutions for the commercial satellite business, which they
said has under-performed because of a deteriorated market. Pressed
for details by J.P. Morgan analyst Joe Nadol, Stevens declined to say
whether a divestiture was in order.</TE>

<TE>   Other earnings news:</TE>
<TE>   * Alaska Air Group Inc., parent of Alaska Airlines, said its
fourth-quarter loss widened to $36.4million, or $1.37 a share, from
$28.9million, or $1.09, a year earlier. The latest results include
federal aid of $52.3million before taxes as part of a U.S. plan to
help airlines after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Sales fell 13% to
$462.2million as air travel demand, already reduced by lower
corporate spending in the U.S. recession, declined further after the
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding government aid and $10.2 million in expenses related to
eliminating some aircraft from the fleet of the company's commuter
unit, Horizon Air, Alaska Air Group had a fourth-quarter loss of
$62.9 million, or $2.37 a share. The carrier was expected to lose
$2.21 a share, based on the average estimate of analysts surveyed by
Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   * Insurance company CNA Financial Corp. forecast a fourth-quarter
net loss, contrasted with a net profit a year earlier, hurt by
charges for restructuring and losses from its exposure to struggling
energy firm Enron Corp. CNA said it expects a fourth-quarter net loss
of $20million to $35million, contrasted with net income of
$193million in the year-earlier period.</TE>

<HD>Blue Chips Move Up for 3rd Day</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Dow's gain is attributed mostly to bargain
hunting rather than improved investor sentiment. Tech issues slip on
mixed news.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors gave blue chips another boost Friday, but nudged tech
stocks slightly lower as they dealt with conflicting signals about
the economy.</LD>
<LD>   Working in Wall Street's favor were comments Thursday by Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said the recession could be over
soon.</LD>
<LD>   But with many companies still unable to confirm a pickup in
business, the market's gains were limited and, in many cases, were
attributed to bargain hunting rather than a shift in investor
sentiment.</LD>
<TE>   Bond yields, meanwhile, spiked again on concerns the Fed may begin
raising interest rates as soon as the second quarter. U.S. Treasuries
wrapped up their roughest week since early December.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note climbed to 5.07%,
from Thursday's close of 5.01%, while the yield on the two-year
T-note rose to 3.18% from 3.14%.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 44.01 points, or
0.5%, at 9,840.08. The Dow pulled out a three-session winning streak
for the first time since Jan. 2 to 4, after advancing 65 points
Thursday on Greenspan's comments and 17 on Wednesday due to bargain
hunting.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow rose 0.7% for the week, breaking a two-week losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   The broader market was mixed Friday, but, like the Dow, ended the
week with small gains. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 4.88
points, or 0.3%, to 1,937.70. For the week, the tech-dominated index
rose 0.4%. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index inched up 1.13 points, or
0.1%, to 1,133.28, moving up 0.5% for the week.</TE>
<TE>   Losers outnumbered winners by 8 to 7 on Nasdaq and were about even
on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading was active.</TE>
<TE>   Gains by blue-chip stocks were attributed by analysts largely to
cheaper prices and somewhat to Greenspan's comments. Procter &amp; Gamble
rose $1.36 to $79.14, Honeywell climbed $1.10 to $32.70 and
Caterpillar gained $1 to $50.10.</TE>
<TE>   Better-than-expected earnings helped other stocks, including
Lockheed Martin, up 59 cents to $50.</TE>
<TE>   In tech trading, PMC-Sierra rose $2.29 to $24.15 after reporting a
fourth-quarter loss of 15 cents a share, a penny better than
expected. And Goldman Sachs raised its rating on the maker of
semiconductor equipment.</TE>
<TE>   But disappointing reports and outlooks kept the overall tech
sector from advancing. Fiber-optic maker JDS Uniphase fell 73 cents
to $7.16 on a wider-than-expected loss.</TE>
<TE>   Computer maker Gateway slid nearly 18%, down $1.14 to $5.22, after
saying Thursday it will cut 2,250 jobs and close 19 stores and
several offices as it deals with sluggish sales and declining market
share. Several investment banks downgraded Gateway's shares.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation that the Bush administration may move to limit
liability for asbestos lawsuits was credited with boosting some
stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Topping the list of gainers on the NYSE were companies facing
asbestos liabilities, including chemicals company W.R. Grace, up 50
cents to $2.41, and building materials maker Owens Corning, up 47
cents to $2.42.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks have largely fallen this month amid a lack of positive
forecasts from companies. Analysts said the sell-off wasn't
surprising, given how strongly investors snapped up shares late last
year based on hopes of a rebound in profits rather than evidence of
growth.</TE>
<TE>   "The fourth-quarter rally was an anticipatory rally that comes as
you believe the worst is over. Some pullback from that was expected,"
said Ronald J. Hill, investment strategist at Brown Bros. Harriman &amp;
Co. "When earnings start to come through in earnest, there will be a
second, more fundamental leg up. We're kind of in a hiatus right
now."</TE>

<HD>Milberg Weiss Confirms Inquiry</HD>
<DH>Plaintiffs: Law firm says grand jury is examining whether
it paid people to join shareholder suits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN and LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The high-profile law firm Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &amp; Lerach
confirmed Friday that it is the subject of a Los Angeles federal
grand jury probe that is examining whether the firm and others paid
people to serve as plaintiffs in shareholder class-action suits.</LD>
<LD>   Criminal defense lawyers said Friday that a wave of grand jury
subpoenas issued to shareholders who had repeatedly appeared in the
lawsuits had touched off a scramble for representation. "My firm must
have gotten three or four calls from people who are looking for
lawyers in that case," said an attorney who would not speak for
attribution.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers who had been contacted said it was unclear whether
authorities are targeting the plaintiffs or seeking to pressure them
to testify against law firms that might have paid them.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors declined to comment Friday on how many law firms may
be included in the investigation. "I'm not prepared to comment on the
scope of the investigation," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Richard
Robinson--adding quickly that he was not even confirming that there
is one.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting the high stakes in the case, Milberg Weiss has retained
Washington law firm Williams &amp; Connolly, which represented President
Clinton in the Whitewater case and his impeachment trial, and
Iran-Contra figure Lt. Col. Oliver North. Jerry Feffer, a Williams &amp;
Connolly partner, said Milberg Weiss "will cooperate with any
government inquiry."</TE>
<TE>   Milberg Weiss has become a pariah in corporate America by filing
hundreds of shareholder suits accusing companies of misleading
investors. Milberg is the dominant player among several large firms
that pursue these cases.</TE>
<TE>   Milberg is competing to become lead counsel for shareholders suing
failed energy giant Enron Corp. In recent days, its best-known
partner, William Lerach, who is based in San Diego, has appeared in
court in Houston and on news reports holding what he said were
shredded Enron documents. Lerach declined to be interviewed Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation is believed to have started or gained momentum
from the cooperation of Steven G. Cooperman, a Beverly Hills eye
surgeon who is serving a prison term for staging an art theft to
collect millions of dollars in insurance. Cooperman had been a
plaintiff in more than three dozen shareholder lawsuits, some of them
filed by Milberg Weiss.</TE>
<TE>   He faced up to 183 years in prison based on his conviction on 18
counts, including conspiracy and wire fraud, but received a prison
sentence of 37 months. People close to the investigation said
Cooperman began cooperating with the shareholder investigation before
his sentencing in July.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Lightfoot, one of Cooperman's lawyers, declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the outcome, the investigation could be a blow to
Milberg's campaign to be appointed lead counsel for shareholders
suing Enron for tens of billions of dollars. Lead firms typically get
the largest share of fees.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of Lerach, Jim Newman, who heads a securities class-
action research organization in New York, said it "dampens his
chance" of getting the plum appointment "if there's a cloud over his
firm."</TE>
<TE>   Milberg has pursued numerous lawsuits against Silicon Valley firms
over initial public offerings. "Being sued by Bill Lerach, in Silicon
Valley especially, has come to be known as being 'Lerached,'" said
Bill Ballowe, assistant vice president of San Francisco insurance
broker Woodruff &amp; Sawyer.</TE>
<TE>   In a move aimed largely at Lerach and his law firm, business firms
convinced Congress to override a presidential veto and pass the 1995
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. The law raised the
standards of evidence required to establish corporate fraud and
limited "professional plaintiffs" to appearing in no more than five
class actions in three years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Lerach suffered a major defeat when he was forced to pay
a $50-million legal settlement to one of his targets. Lexecon Inc.
accused him of maliciously naming the Chicago-based legal and
economics firm as a defendant in a suit against Lincoln Savings &amp;
Loan.</TE>
<TE>   "Firms like Milberg Weiss provide an important service in the case
of real corporate wrongdoing," said Jan L. Handzlik, a partner at
Kirkland &amp; Ellis and chairman of the American Bar Assn.'s national
committee on white-collar crime. "Individual shareholders do not have
the power to vindicate their rights in some cases.</TE>
<TE>   "But allegations that shareholders have been paid to pursue
spurious claims are very serious and should be investigated
thoroughly."</TE>

<HD>Raytheon Unit Shows Up on Radar</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: Sept. 11 gives defense-electronics division a
much higher national profile.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a while, Raytheon Corp.'s sprawling defense-electronics operation
in El Segundo, which develops everything from radar systems to spy
equipment, seemed more like a financial albatross than a cash cow.</LD>
<LD>   After paying an exorbitant $9.5billion for the business, Raytheon
has had to jettison several businesses to pay down the debt and avoid
having its credit rating drop to junk-bond level.</LD>
<LD>   The operations are part of the legacy of Howard Hughes that
General Motors Co. acquired a decade earlier in its $5-billion
acquisition of Hughes Aircraft.</LD>
<TE>   Cultural differences hindered prospects for a smooth and quick
integration as Raytheon's centralized management style clashed with
aloof engineers accustomed to having headquarters stay out of their
way.</TE>
<TE>   But in the last few weeks, thanks in part to renewed focus on
defense and homeland security after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
top Raytheon executives are seeing the business in a more favorable
light, and that may bode well for the aerospace industry in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Raytheon Chief Executive Daniel P. Burnham gave the
Electronic Systems unit a glowing endorsement as he announced he was
selling the company's aircraft modification and repair division so it
could focus on businesses that have been central to the electronic
unit's growth.</TE>
<TE>   The Electronic Systems unit, which also has major operations in
Arizona, Texas and Massachusetts, is headquartered in El Segundo and
employs 35,000 people, with about a quarter based in Southern
California. About 6,500 engineers work in El Segundo while nearly
2,000 work in Goleta and about 500 in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   President Proposes Defense Spending Hike</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the Raytheon unit got even a bigger boost from
President Bush as he proposed the biggest defense spending increase
in more than two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "We will invest in more precision weapons, in missile defenses, in
unmanned vehicles, in high-tech equipment for soldiers on the
ground,'' Bush said, citing core areas of business for Raytheon. "The
tools of modern warfare are effective. They are expensive. But in
order to win this war against terror, they are essential."</TE>
<TE>   The remarks could not have been more timely.</TE>
<TE>   A week earlier, Burnham had noted that the sale of the aircraft
repair business "represents a major step in our strategy to focus on
growth in key areas such as missile defense; intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance electronics, precision-strike weapons
systems and homeland defense."</TE>
<TE>   "This transaction provides us financial flexibility and the
strategic resources to dedicate to these markets," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Four areas of growth have been cornerstones of the El Segundo
operations:</TE>
<TE>   * Developing radars and kill vehicles to defend against ballistic
missiles.</TE>
<TE>   * Making spy components for intelligence gathering.</TE>
<TE>   * Assembling missiles and precision-guided bombs.</TE>
<TE>   * Developing new devices to detect terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "What's the core? What's this company all about? It's about
businesses in El Segundo," said Byron K. Callan, an aerospace analyst
with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. "That's the heart and soul of their
business. It is by far the most desirable part of their portfolio."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed. Though revenue has been growing at an average of about 6%
to 7% annually, operating margins have been in the range of 10% to
12%, nearly double the industry average, said Paul H. Nisbet, an
analyst with JSA Research Inc.</TE>
<TE>   In reporting the company's fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday,
Burnham said the Electronic Systems unit had actually posted
operating margins of nearly 14% and that the company's defense sales
had jumped by more than 10%.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe we have some of the best margins in the industry,"
William H. Swanson, president of the unit, said during an interview
last week.</TE>
<TE>   After making some painful post-merger cuts--the number of
employees in Southern California was slashed by a third, from about
15,000 three ago to 10,000--the company began hiring again last year,
adding 400 workers in El Segundo alone.</TE>
<TE>   "Bad news will be minimal. It will be a good story," Swanson said,
outlining what he expects to tell employees in his annual meetings.
"For two years, we've been fixing and shaping the business. This year
the word is going to be on growth."</TE>
<TE>   The local economy is closely tied to the unit's performance. In
addition to its employment base--most of whom are engineers with
higher-paying jobs--the unit is a powerful economic engine for the
region.</TE>
<TE>   The unit's payroll in Southern California exceeds $725million
annually and has contracts worth $416million with 2,433 suppliers in
the area, many of them mom-and-pop operations with a handful of
employees.</TE>
<TE>   But if the past is any indication, Swanson's "Raytheon story"
could be a challenging one to tell, particularly for people outside
the company who have little idea of what Raytheon does.</TE>
<TE>   The Raytheon unit is involved in virtually every aspect of major
defense programs but rarely gets recognized for them.</TE>
<TE>   The unit manages some 5,000 different programs from electronic
radar-jamming equipment for fighter jets and electro-optic sensors
for spy planes, to guidance systems for Trident missiles and X-band
radar for missile defense.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Northrop Grumman Corp. is widely known as the maker
of the highly touted Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle, although
Raytheon provides the vehicle's brains and vital components such as
sensors and controls.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the Raytheon problems is that we are a little stealthy,"
Swanson said.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, being involved in myriad programs rather than
taking the lead on a few major defense contracts, has helped shield
the unit from wide financial gyrations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some Setbacks in Recent Months</TE>
<TE>   Still, Raytheon was dealt several blows in recent months,
including being on the losing team in competition for the Joint
Strike Fighter, facing a government-ordered delay in deployment of
the SIBRS-Low satellite system for missile defense, and cancellation
of a Navy missile-defense program that had the potential of
generating $700 million in sales over the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   However, it won a $265-million contract for an upgraded
early-warning radar, $197 million to retrofit radars on Canadian F-18
aircraft, $113 million for F-15 fighter radar, and others with a
total value of $8.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Raytheon also is negotiating terms for the sale of Patriot
antimissile systems to South Korea for $1.6 billion and is expected
to be a major beneficiary of the Pentagon's plans to add nearly $7
billion to its budget over the next five years to improve its
intelligence-gathering capabilities and tracking missiles.</TE>
<TE>   In all, funded backlog rose 21% last year, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the unit's business performance, Raytheon stock languished
for a while and only recently surged on a general expectation of
defense buildup.</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, Raytheon stock had fallen nearly two-thirds from
a high of $75 in the summer of 1999 to about $25 as the company
struggled to manage all the businesses it had acquired. The purchases
saddled the company with more than $10 billion in debt.</TE>
<TE>   But after the upturn in the defense outlook and the paring of
businesses, such as its construction and engineering and marine
navigation systems, Raytheon shares surged nearly 26%.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the increase was related to the strength of the
defense-electronics business. On Thursday, the day after Bush
announced the $38-billion spending plan, Raytheon shares shot up more
than 7%, one of the biggest one-day gains in years. They advanced
$1.03 to $35.27 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts are upbeat as Raytheon continues to emphasize those
operations and looks to shed its corporate jet-making operations in
Wichita, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole company will end up being Electronic Systems," Nisbet
said. "I think they'll sell the aircraft business, and that will be
about it."</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state panel that oversees and licenses the accounting industry is
debating new rules to limit outside consulting and require accounting
firms to keep more records of their work.</LD>
<LD>   The California Board of Accountancy proposed the rule changes in
the wake of Enron Corp.'s record bankruptcy and questions about
whether its accountant, Andersen, properly certified its financial
statements. The Board of Accountancy licenses more than 62,000
accountants and can investigate and discipline them.</LD>
<LD>   "We need a standard that says working papers need to be retained
for as long as the financial documents are needed for public
consumption," Michael Granen, the board's lawyer on loan from the
state attorney general's office, said during a hearing in San
Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   Enron filed the largest U.S. bankruptcy Dec. 4, wiping out
$26billion in market value and leaving thousands of workers
unemployed.</TE>

<LD>DaimlerChrysler said that it has recalled about 65,000 1998-99
Mercedes C-Class cars in the United States after five complaints of
exploding batteries, resulting in one injury from flying acid and
debris.</LD>
<LD>   The explosions occurred when the electrolyte fluid levels in the
battery fell to low levels. Mercedes dealers will inspect the
batteries on the recalled vehicles free of charge and replace them if
necessary.</LD>
<LD>   General Motors Corp., meanwhile, said that it has recalled 546,000
of its 2000-01 Chevrolet Blazer, GMC Jimmy and Oldsmobile Bravada
mid-size sport-utility vehicles after complaints of faulty brake and
hazard lights. The recalled cars were sold around the world, GM said.</LD>
<TE>   GM said it had two reports of accidents that may have been related
to the rear brake and hazard lights failing to illuminate.</TE>
<TE>   GM said it is testing replacement parts and will later ship them
to dealers who will inspect the recalled vehicles and, if necessary,
repair the lights at no cost.</TE>
<TE>   GM said the recall does not include the all-new 2002 Chevrolet
TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy and Oldsmobile Bravada SUVs.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg New</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Allergan Inc. filed a lawsuit seeking to block rivals Alcon
Laboratories Inc. and Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc. from selling generic
versions of its Alphagan glaucoma treatment.</LD>
<LD>   Allergan said it owns the rights to two patents that relate to
Alphagan, a brimonidine tartrate solution. Alphagan accounted for
about 15% of Allergan's $1.56 billion in 2000 sales, according to
Securities and Exchange Commission filings.</LD>
<LD>   Bausch &amp; Lomb and Alcon, a unit of Swiss food maker Nestle,
applied to the Food and Drug Administration for permission to sell a
generic form of Alphagan. Allergan claims the applications infringe
its patents.</LD>
<TE>   Irvine-based Allergan seeks a court order blocking the sale of any
infringing products until after the patents expire.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Bausch &amp; Lomb fell 13 cents to $38.77 on the New York
Stock Exchange, and Allergan shares fell $1.78 to $70.99, also on the
NYSE.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Amtrak lost more money last year than at any time in its history,
posting an operating loss of $1.1 billion even as it desperately
tried to end dependence on federal subsidies, a government report
said.</LD>
<LD>   That loss was $129 million more than the previous year and put a
significant amount of new pressure on the 30-year-old national
passenger rail system, which is struggling to avoid a major
restructuring or dissolution.</LD>
<LD>   Amtrak's cash loss, which was the basis for measuring its drive
for sustaining its operations without government help, was $585
million in fiscal year 2001, according to the report by the
Transportation Department inspector general.</LD>
<TE>   The report confirmed what an Amtrak oversight board concluded in
November: that the railroad would not be self-sufficient by the end
of this year as Congress demanded in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The report said Amtrak's cash loss this fiscal year would be $511
million, which is $263 million more than it would need to qualify for
operating self-sufficiency under the congressional order.</TE>

<LD>A former Sony Pictures vice president and another woman were charged
in a theft and money-laundering scam at the studio involving about
$500,000, the Los Angeles County district attorney said.</LD>
<LD>   Georgett Sue Studnicka, 60, a former vice president of music
publishing for Sony Pictures Entertainment, and Linda Sue Brooks, 55,
a friend of Studnicka's, were each charged with one count of grand
theft and three counts of money laundering.</LD>
<LD>   Studnicka also is charged with evading state taxes in 1997, 1998
and 1999.</LD>
<TE>   Studnicka's job included overseeing the sale and leasing of music
used in Sony films. Studnicka allegedly authorized payments to a
company created by Brooks in 1991, and the payments grew to more than
$100,000 by 1998, although Sony never received anything for these
payments, according to the district attorney's office. Studnicka and
Brooks could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<LD>   Sony sold 5 million PlayStation 2 consoles in December, leading a
7% surge in sales to a record $17billion and prompting the company to
raise its sales and operating profit forecasts for the year. The
weaker yen helped the electronics business, which makes Wega
televisions and Mavica digital cameras, post its first profit in four
quarters.</LD>
<TE>   Third-quarter net income was higher than the average $290-million
profit forecast by four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   The company raised its annual sales forecast to $56.1 million and
boosted by almost a tenth its outlook for operating profit--the
amount left after manufacturing, selling and administrative expenses
are subtracted from sales-- $968 million.</TE>
<TE>   Sony attributed the increases to the effect of the weaker Japanese
currency, which raises the value of Sony's overseas sales when
converted back to yen. A 1-yen decline against the dollar boosts
Sony's yearly operating profit by $60 million, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   In the third quarter, PlayStation2 shipments almost doubled to
5.42 million units compared with a year ago, contributing to an
operating profit of $494 million as sales at the company's game
business soared 63% to $2.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at Sony's music division rose almost 11% to $1.5 billion.
Sales at the movie division rose 12% to $1.2 billion. Music sales
were helped by higher sales in Europe and the benefits of efforts to
cut costs, the company said. The company's movie division eked out a
profit compared with a loss in the year-ago period. Operating profit
was $2million.</TE>
<TE>   Sony said its movie business was hampered in the quarter--sales
were almost unchanged on a U.S. dollar basis--by lower theatrical
sales because of the timing of movie releases, including the poor
performance of "Riding in Cars With Boys."</TE>

<HD>Ericsson Posts Loss Amid Sales Slump</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ericsson, the biggest phone-equipment maker, said Friday that it had
a fourth-quarter loss because of its unprofitable handset venture and
a slump in network sales.</LD>
<LD>   The Stockholm phone giant stuck to a forecast of posting an
operating profit in 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Ericsson lost $330 million compared with a profit of $215.4
million a year earlier. The company took a pretax charge of $159.2
million for potential Latin American losses.</LD>
<TE>   Sales at Ericsson and rivals such as Nortel Networks Corp. are
plunging as phone companies around the world reduce network spending
to preserve cash and pay back debt. Yet Ericsson expects last year's
cost-cutting program, which included firing a fifth of its work
force, to help it counter the slowdown this year.</TE>
<TE>   "The first and second quarters will be tough," said Chief
Executive Kurt Hellstroem, adding that the company will lose money
this quarter. Operators "talk about making new investments, but they
don't say when."</TE>
<TE>   Ericsson said its first-quarter sales will fall about 32%, to
about $3.7 billion. It forecast an operating loss in the first
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden's biggest company lost $2 billion in 2001, recording its
first annual loss in more than half a century. That compares with a
record profit of $1.96 billion in 2000. Analysts had expected a
fourth-quarter loss of $292.2 million and a full-year loss of $1.95
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-quarter sales fell 15%, to $5.5 billion, excluding the
parts of the mobile-phone business transferred to a venture with Sony
Corp. in October. Analysts expected sales of $5.1 billion. Ericsson
generates about 15% of its total revenue in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   The loss from Ericsson's 50% share of the venture, called Sony
Ericsson Mobile Communications Ltd., was $65.5 million. That's less
than the $108 million expected by analysts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other technology earnings news:</TE>
<TE>   *JDS Uniphase Corp., the biggest maker of parts used in
fiber-optic equipment, said its fiscal second-quarter loss widened as
sales fell 69%, the fourth straight decline. The company said it
couldn't predict when sales will rebound. The loss widened to $2.13
billion, or $1.60 a share, in the quarter ended Dec. 29, from $895.4
million, or 93 cents, a year ago. Sales fell to $286.1 million from
$925.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   JDS said it isn't certain that third-quarter sales, expected to
fall as much as 8.7% from the second period, will mark a low point.
Orders for JDS components tumbled last year after demand for
fiber-optic equipment fell and customers decided to use stockpiled
parts.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi to Purchase Premium Wireless</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Media giant Vivendi Universal will acquire Santa Monica-based Premium
Wireless Services Inc. for about $10 million, according to sources
familiar with the deal, as a first step toward building a foothold in
the U.S. wireless industry.</LD>
<LD>   Premium Wireless operates YourMobile.com, which provides
downloadable ring tones and logos to cell phone users worldwide and
allows users to personalize their phones with their favorite songs.
Its customers include Qualcomm Inc. and Cingular Wireless.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi Universal is a leading player in the wireless industry in
Europe.</LD>
<TE>   Through a series of high-profile acquisitions in the last year,
including its $10-billion purchase of the entertainment assets of USA
Networks, Vivendi has been trying to build a strong presence in the
U.S. to take on media rivals such as AOL Time Warner. YourMobile .com
gives Vivendi an additional digital outlet for its movies, music and
games, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Other major entertainment players also are moving into the
cellular phone market, including rival Walt Disney Co., which last
month announced a deal with AT&amp;T Corp. making Disney-branded ring
tones and graphics available to U.S. wireless subscribers. Disney
Internet in August 2000 agreed to provide content to users of NTT
DoCoMo's wireless phone service in Japan and has since signed several
more deals with Asian wireless companies.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody knows what business model is going to work, but at the
same time, nobody wants to be a laggard if it does take off," said
John Bucher, an analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison &amp; Co. in Los
Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Fame Is Elusive: Eddie Murphy Impersonator Makes Greatest
Escape List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amateur Eddie Murphy impersonator Kevin Pullum earns a mention in a
list of America's "greatest prison escapes" in the current issue of
Stuff magazine.</LD>
<LD>   Pullum, you'll recall, was the inmate who sneaked out of L.A.'s
Twin Towers jail with the help of a fake employee ID card that bore a
photo of the actor. Stuff salutes Pullum as "the Nutty Prisoner."</LD>
<LD>   The magazine also recognizes the work of Forrest "Woody" Tucker,
whose greatest feat was escaping San Quentin, then paddling away into
San Francisco Bay on a 14-foot kayak he built in the prison wood
shop.</LD>
<TE>   Tucker stenciled the words "Rub-a-Dub-Dub--Marin Yacht Club" on
the craft for his 1979 sail-away.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the time in 1956 when Tucker was taken from
Alcatraz to an L.A. hospital for a kidney operation. As he was rolled
into the operating room--in handcuffs--he leaped off the gurney and
fled to freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Tucker made a reported 18 escapes before he was nabbed robbing a
Florida bank in 1999 at the age of 78. (If he busted out again after
my deadline Friday night, my figures may be off.)</TE>
<TE>   Unreal estate: Today's puzzling properties (see accompanying)
include:</TE>
<TE>   * A house with some macho upgrades. "Does it have a built-in beer
keg?" asks Steve Fiechter of Whittier. "Or maybe the whole house is
simply an outfitted garage."</TE>
<TE>   * An estate with a golf hole that will delight beginners (F.B.
Hogan of Westminster and Phil Gutierrez of Anaheim).</TE>
<TE>   * An apartment best suited for a renter with "nonskid soles,"
points out Audrey Cowan of Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Anything but pals in Palisades: The Palisadian Post's "Your Two
Cents Worth" column of anonymous phone messages from readers included
this grumpy missive:</TE>
<TE>   "My advice to Mr. Muscle renting a house in the Wildomar/Junaluska
neighborhood: Please close the garage door and turn off some lights.
There is an energy crisis and we have all seen your tired old body."</TE>
<TE>   Stupid Criminal Tricks: The Long Beach Press-Telegram's crime log
reported that a youth with a knife stole a car from two men who were
working on the vehicle. Moments later, the thief crashed the car into
a tree, police said. Reason: He was driving it with the hood still
up.</TE>
<TE>   What would Philip Marlowe think? While prowling the mean streets
of Long Beach the other day, I fell in behind a car with the license
plate LA PI. The license frame indicated the driver was a private
investigator.</TE>
<TE>   Interesting. I would think that a gumshoe would prefer anonymity
while parked on surveillance. Wouldn't the license plate be what is
known in the trade as a "clue"? (You can tell I read a lot of mystery
novels.)</TE>
<TE>   Letter imperfect: After Cal's basketball team defeated USC, 92-91,
on Thursday, the Fox Sports cameras showed the USC cheerleaders
smiling and making the V sign. Normally at sports events, the V
stands for "victory." I guess in this case it meant "vanquished."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Regarding the ad that referred to a "spin-it"
piano--it should have said "spinet"-- Peter Jacobsen writes: "How did
you resist the temptation to call it a 'Wurlitzer'?"</TE>

<HD>New Appreciation for Old Garbage</HD>
<DH>Collection: Lake Los Angeles woman's yard is festooned with
rusty treasures found in the high desert.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL CHAMBERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beverly Swain calls it her "rusty stuff"--a decade's worth of funky
finds she picked up while horseback riding in the high desert of the
Antelope Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The Lake Los Angeles homemaker finds uses for what others
apparently considered junk. She turned an electric fan grate and a
dozen odd bolts into wind chimes, for example, and made a bird's nest
of an old vacuum cleaner casing.</LD>
<LD>   Scores of her prized tchotchkes are strategically placed among
cactus in her frontyard, creating a rust garden of toy trucks, sewing
machines, wagon parts and farm tools. Her collection of perhaps
thousands of items, in its own way, may illustrate the history of the
area during the last century.</LD>
<TE>   "A hundred years ago, this was all alfalfa farms," Swain said.
"One of these days I'm going to put a whole tractor together with the
parts I've found."</TE>
<TE>   For thousands of years, Native Americans occupied the region,
which included trade routes from the coast to the Southwest's deserts
and from California's Central Valley to Mexico, said Edra Moore,
curator of the Antelope Valley Indian Museum.</TE>
<TE>   To promote farming in the 1920s, the federal government opened up
the high desert to homesteaders. To claim their land, they were
required to dig a well, plant a crop, occupy the land and build a
permanent residence. By the mid-1930s, alfalfa and onion fields
blanketed the area, Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   Formerly named Wilsona after President Wilson, the area became
Lake Los Angeles in 1967 when a Santa Monica-based developer created
a lake as the centerpiece of a planned community. But the developer
drained the lake in 1981 when the residents refused to pay for its
maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Swain moved there, Lake Los Angeles was a misnomer,
with no lake and the city of Los Angeles nearly 100 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   The community of about 12,000 at the northeast edge of Los Angeles
County is also a long way from Swain's roots. Growing up in
apartments on Chicago's South Side, Swain, 46, said she had always
wanted a horse. On a visit to the Antelope Valley more than 20 years
ago, she fell in love with the open space of the high desert,
returning to Chicago only to pack up and move.</TE>
<TE>   "This desert has got so much energy, and it's good energy," Swain
said on a recent sunny afternoon as she tended her menagerie of four
horses, a donkey, chickens, cats and dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Riding either My Jim Dandy or Abby Normal on her desert digs,
Swain said she often comes across something that's too big to bring
back on horseback, so she returns for it in her truck.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to leave an old wooden wagon out there and I still haven't
found it again," she said. "And that was nine years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Under Swain's creative eye, a rusted Radio Flyer wagon becomes a
planter, while wire fencing forms a trellis for climbing roses. She's
still trying to decide what to do with the old Lovell wringer washer
she found "out there somewhere."</TE>
<TE>   Finding uses for junk, an age-old practice worldwide, became
recognized as a contemporary art form in the 1920s, after such noted
artists as Marcel Duchamp and later Edward Kienholz adopted the
concept, said Amy Hood of the UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History.</TE>
<TE>   Not long ago, the Fowler Museum hosted a major exhibition on junk
art, "Recycled, Re-seen: Folk Art from the Global Scrap Heap," which
featured about 700 objects from 50 countries made of recycled
material.</TE>
<TE>   Swain said she gives away the wind chimes she makes and has no
plans to sell the rest of her desert trove, which she has never had
appraised.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a lot of people see something out here and tell me,
'This might be valuable. Why do you leave it out?' In all these
years, I've only had one thing stolen that I know of," she said,
referring to an old farm tool taken from her garden.</TE>
<TE>   And what is the most common item she finds on her rides in the
desert?</TE>
<TE>   "Beer cans," Swain said. "I find a lot of Schlitz. People around
here must have really liked Schlitz. Schlitz and Coors."</TE>
<TE>   Moore said people occasionally bring things they find in the
desert to the Indian Museum for identification, although the museum's
primary focus is on Native American cultures and the area's
archeological sites, which are protected by law.</TE>
<TE>   People have been using the desert as a dump for years to avoid
paying disposal fees, Moore said, so she's not surprised at anything
found out there.</TE>
<TE>   While most of Swain's finds are easily identifiable, others leave
her completely stumped, such as a rusted, curved piece of iron that
may have been a machine pedal or handle. Or maybe not.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just another rusty thing I found out in the desert," she
said. "I don't know why I pick up some things and not others, except
that they interest me. Maybe they have a story to tell."</TE>

<LD>A drive-by shooting Friday in South-Central Los Angeles left one man
dead and two wounded, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The attack in the 200 block of 88th Street was reported about 5:50
p.m., said Sgt. Henry Quan of the Los Angeles Police Department's

<HD>Minister Pleads Guilty to 1993 Gang Shooting in Santa Ana</HD>
<DH>Courts: Geronimo Galvan Burgos, who converted in prison
years ago, is expected to receive probation for his role in a
drive-by that left one dead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Orange County gang member who moved to Alabama five years
ago and founded a church pleaded guilty Friday to having been
involved in a 1993 drive-by shooting--allegations that surfaced years
after he reformed his life.</LD>
<LD>   The plea bargain means Geronimo Galvan Burgos can go back to his
congregation at least until April, when he is expected to return to
Orange County and receive a probation sentence. Prosecutors agreed to
the plea bargain after concluding that Burgos did not fire a gun in a
street ambush that left one dead and two wounded.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm thankful first for the mercy of God and for the very
understanding court system," Burgos said after the hearing. "I'm
living testimony of how the Gospel can change your life and keep your
life changed."</LD>
<TE>   Burgos said he was shocked when police arrested him last February
at his church in Russellville, Ala., a small town where he lives in a
mobile home with his wife and two children.</TE>
<TE>   The minister spent three months at Orange County Jail, where he
said he counseled young offenders and converted several to
Christianity. At the same time, Burgos said, he lived in fear that
his past actions might land him in prison for life.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors concluded Burgos' role in the shooting was
minimal. Deputy Dist. Atty. Joe D'Agostino dropped murder and
attempted murder charges Friday, allowing Burgos to plead guilty to
helping a murder suspect evade arrest.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor said he was swayed in part because Burgos has
turned his life around. There's a chance Burgos could be called as a
witness if police arrest other suspects in the shooting that took the
life of 20-year-old Christian Madera, a member of a rival gang.</TE>
<TE>   "This was very fair for all sides," D'Agostino said. "He has
turned his life around. He's not a danger to the public at all. And
from our standpoint, we held somebody responsible for being involved
in a gang incident. He's been very cooperative with us, so we can
actually bring someone to justice."</TE>
<TE>   Although Burgos faces up to six years in prison, defense attorney
Vincent Oliver said he expects Burgos to receive probation.</TE>
<TE>   Burgos, 30, said he plans to return to Alabama this weekend. He's
scheduled to preach next week at a church in Indiana, then will focus
on finishing the construction of a Russellville church.</TE>
<TE>   Burgos, a minister for five years, has built a devoted following
in Russellville, where he preaches in Spanish and English and appears
on cable television.</TE>
<TE>   His new life, Burgos said, is a far cry from his days running with
a Santa Ana gang. He said he was a drug addict who robbed to support
his habit. It was in prison, Burgos said, that he made a religious
conversion he believes saved his life.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a miracle," he said. "One of the greatest miracles is the
change of heart. You can take the gang member out of the city. But if
you don't take the gang member out of your heart, you'll start doing
the same things."</TE>
<TE>   He said comparing his current life with his past is "like
comparing light and darkness."</TE>
<TE>   "I was miserable back then. It was a miserable life. I was a
drug-addict gang member. My probation officer told me he expected me
to end up dead or in prison for life," Burgos said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I have a family. I have peace with God. And I don't have to
fear nobody. One of the things gang life brings you is constant
fear."</TE>

<HD>Opponents of Dam Win Reprieve for 40 Oaks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Opponents of the Lang Ranch dam project won their first court battle
Friday, persuading a judge to spare 40 oak trees at the Thousand Oaks
site--at least for two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   After hearing arguments from the Save Lang Oaks Fund, Judge Thomas
J. Hutchins in Ventura County Superior Court agreed to issue a
temporary restraining order blocking the county's plans to cut the
trees on Monday to make way for the dam.</LD>
<LD>   Although construction of the dam was not to begin until April,
officials wanted to clear the trees before bird-nesting season
begins.</LD>
<TE>   Opponents had asked that no trees be cut until the county received
clearance from the state to begin construction. When the state issued
its final permit earlier this week, opponents petitioned the court.</TE>
<TE>   But it may be too soon for the Save Lang Oaks Fund, representing
environmentalists and homeowners in the Lang Ranch subdivision, to
declare victory in its bid to stop or scale back the project.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the group's lawyer, Alyse Lazar, was pleased with the
ruling. "They can't proceed with dam construction until they take
down the trees," Lazar said. "So if we keep the trees up, nothing
else occurs until after this lawsuit is concluded."</TE>
<TE>   The fate of the trees will be revisited at a Feb. 8 hearing.
Meanwhile, opponents have filed a lawsuit alleging state
environmental and safety laws were not properly followed in the dam's
permitting process and that a new environmental review should be
conducted. Lawyers for the county say they are confident they will
prevail despite the restraining order.</TE>
<TE>   "This process does not go to the merits of their underlying case,"
said Daniel Murphy, assistant county counsel. "It's simply to
preserve the status quo until [the county] can provide answers to the
court."</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the Ventura County Flood Control District have said
the dam is needed to protect downstream homeowners and habitat in the
event of a 100-year storm. Opponents argue the dam is not needed,
that it could be smaller or should be located elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months opponents have argued that a nearby landslide
could affect the stability of a dam. County officials say they have
taken the landslide area into account and concluded it did not pose a
problem. But opponents maintain the county hasn't thoroughly
investigated the risk.</TE>

<HD>Vasquez OKd as Leader of Peace Corps</HD>
<DH>Government: The former O.C. supervisor, criticized after
the county's bankruptcy, had been opposed in a grass-roots campaign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE and NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Gaddi H. Vasquez, a cop turned Orange County politician before he
moved into the executive ranks of Southern California Edison, was
confirmed Friday as director of the Peace Corps, one of the nation's
most respected international humanitarian programs.</LD>
<LD>   The approval came without dissent as the U.S. Senate acted on more
than 30 Bush administration appointments, some of which had hung in
limbo for weeks while the Senate wrestled with the White House over
unrelated issues.</LD>
<LD>   "I am very pleased that the U.S. Senate has confirmed my
nomination from President Bush," Vasquez said in a prepared statement
released through the Peace Corps. "I look forward to coming to the
Peace Corps and working with this fine organization that means so
much to the world."</LD>
<TE>   Vasquez, an Edison divisional vice president for public affairs,
could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The confirmation was one of many made by unanimous consent in a
nearly empty Senate chamber. Among the appointees was Harold Craig
Manson as assistant secretary of the Interior Department for fish and
wildlife. Manson served as chief counsel of the state Department of
Fish and Game under Gov. Pete Wilson, and is a Sacramento County
Superior Court judge.</TE>
<TE>   The quiet approval of Vasquez contrasted with the opposition that
erupted when the nomination was made in July. Former Peace Corps
volunteers mounted a grass-roots campaign against Vasquez over
questions about his role in the Orange County bankruptcy, and his
credentials to run a $265-million agency fielding 7,300 volunteers in
70 countries.</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez's detractors greeted Friday's vote with frustrated
resignation.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we expected it, and I think it's wait-and-see at this
point," said former volunteer Barbara Ferris. "I can assure you that
we will watch his tenure closely."</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez has neither direct experience in international
humanitarian issues, nor as a chief executive in the public or
private sectors.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is a perfect and kind of sad example of what happens
when campaign contributions determine who is selected to run
government agencies," said John Coyne, editor of
PeaceCorpsWriters.org and director of the New York Regional
Recruiting Office of the Peace Corps.</TE>
<TE>   Yet supporters of Vasquez say many former Peace Corps directors
came to the job similarly shrouded in questions and excelled.</TE>
<TE>   Although former volunteers form a large support network for the
agency, Peace Corps spokeswoman Ellen Field said she doubted that the
wrangling over the nomination would significantly affect relations
within the agency.</TE>
<TE>   "The opposition was a very, very small number of people, and the
overwhelming majority have the best interests of the agency at
heart," Field said.</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez's nomination was a reemergence for the once-rising Latino
GOP star who resigned as a county supervisor in 1995, nine months
after the county filed for bankruptcy in an investment scandal.</TE>

<HD>Year's First Substantial Rain, Snow on the Way</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first substantial rain and snow of the year are expected this
weekend as a cold winter storm sweeps down the coast and into
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   National Weather Service forecasters said that after increasing
cloudiness today, rain should start falling in the Los Angeles area
late Sunday morning, with showers off and on until early Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "This storm won't be a heavy rainmaker, but things will get wet,"
with up to half an inch of rain in the valleys and up to an inch in
the foothills, said Stuart Seto, a weather specialist for the agency.
"The big thing will be the cooler air moving in behind it."</LD>
<TE>   Temperatures will plunge Sunday night, with snow levels dipping as
low as 1,500 feet in the coldest parts of the San Bernardino, San
Gabriel and Tehachapi mountains, forecasters said.</TE>
<TE>   That could spell trouble for overnight motorists on Interstate 5
in the Tejon Pass and on Interstate 15 in the Cajon Pass, both of
which are above 4,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   But the snow should delight skiers, with as much as 6 inches
expected at resorts above 5,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   The weather service said there could even be a dusting of light
snow in the foothills above Altadena, La Canada Flintridge and
Monrovia.</TE>
<TE>   Wind chills should become dangerously low by Monday, the weather
service said.</TE>
<TE>   Skies are expected to be clear Monday afternoon, but temperatures
will remain cold, with lows dipping to near freezing Tuesday morning
in parts of the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys.</TE>
<TE>   By Friday, another storm system could bring more rain and snow.</TE>
<TE>   January, normally one of the wettest months in Southern
California, has been unusually dry this year, with only .12 of an
inch of rain falling in downtown Los Angeles since Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The rainfall total for the period from July 1 through June 30 is
only 2.98 inches, less than half the normal of 6.26 inches by this
time.</TE>
<TE>   Long-term forecasts by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration call for normal to somewhat below-normal rainfall
through April.</TE>

<LD>The Orange County district attorney's office won't seek the death
penalty against a man accused of masterminding the ambush-style
slaying of racing legend Mickey Thompson, a prosecutor disclosed
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Goodwin's age, 56, and lack of prior criminal history were
key factors in deciding not to pursue his execution, Deputy Dist.
Atty. David Brent said.</LD>
<LD>   "This was a heinous crime, but it takes more than that," the
prosecutor said. "He's still facing life without parole. It's a
significant punishment."</LD>
<TE>   Thompson and his wife were slain outside their home in the upscale
San Gabriel Valley community of Bradbury. Although Goodwin was long a
suspect, the case remained unsolved for more than a decade. Last
month, prosecutors filed murder charges. Goodwin has long maintained
his innocence.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Opponents of the Lang Ranch dam project won their first court battle
Friday, persuading a judge to spare 40 oak trees at the Thousand Oaks
site--at least for two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   After hearing arguments from the Save Lang Oaks Fund, Judge Thomas
J. Hutchins in Ventura County Superior Court agreed to issue a
temporary restraining order blocking the county's plans to cut the
trees on Monday to make way for the dam.</LD>
<LD>   Although construction of the dam was not to begin until April,
officials wanted to clear the trees before bird-nesting season
begins.</LD>
<TE>   The fate of the trees will be revisited at a Feb. 8 hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the Ventura County Flood Control District have said
the dam is needed to protect downstream homeowners and habitat.
Opponents argue the dam is not needed.</TE>

<HD>Riordan and Davis Trade TV Attack Ads</HD>
<DH>Politics: Governor criticizes past support of antiabortion
candidates and groups by the GOP front-runner, who airs his response.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK and JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the first clash between the front-runners in the race for
governor, Gov. Gray Davis launched a 30-second television ad Friday
night criticizing former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan for his
past support of antiabortion candidates and organizations.</LD>
<LD>   Riordan, a Republican who has touted support for abortion rights
as he seeks to appeal to Democrats and independents, responded with
his own ad. He said Davis had "chosen to attack me personally" and
that "Californians deserve better."</LD>
<LD>   The alternating salvos came 39 days before the Republican party
formally selects its nominee to challenge Davis in November, and
served to reflect the commanding lead Riordan has opened up in the
primary.</LD>
<TE>   "Where does Richard Riordan really stand on a woman's right to
choose?" asks Davis' 30-second spot, which replaces the biographical
ads Davis has aired statewide since last week.</TE>
<TE>   Among its criticisms, it says Riordan gave money to antiabortion
candidates "as recently as 2001." That was a reference to Riordan's
contribution to Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan also raised $500,000 to back the failed 1987 effort to win
Judge Robert Bork--a longtime critic of the landmark abortion-rights
decision Roe v. Wade--a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court, and
contributed money to the antiabortion groups Americans United for
Life and the Right to Life League.</TE>
<TE>   "Riordan," the spot concludes. "Is this a record we can trust?"</TE>
<TE>   The ad does not mention that the most recent of the contributions
to the antiabortion groups was in 1991, a $10,000 gift from a
foundation established by Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   The Riordan campaign's response was filmed in December, in
anticipation of a Davis attack.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in taking responsibility and being accountable.
Unfortunately, Gov. Davis thinks differently," Riordan says in the
segment. "Instead of outlining his plans for our future, he has
chosen to attack me personally."</TE>
<TE>   Looking directly into the camera, he added a gibe at Davis'
governance: "We have a huge budget deficit, jobs leaving our state
and children underperforming in our schools."</TE>
<TE>   According to those familiar with the ads, the Davis campaign is
spending about $1.5 million per week on its ad, and the Riordan
response will cost somewhat less, about $1 million per week.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is unusual for incumbents to fire across party lines
before the primary, there has been a model in recent California
history, cited Friday by the Davis campaign: Former Gov. Pete Wilson
ran ads on the immigration stance of Democrat Kathleen Brown before
her primary in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson's strategy was to force Brown into a position of angering
some part of her constituency no matter how she responded.</TE>
<TE>   In the same fashion, the Davis camp is attempting to carve away
support for Riordan among moderates and some Democrats who were
attracted to the former mayor's middle-of-the-road social stands.
They also want to call into question his characterizations of his
record.</TE>
<TE>   As the campaign unfolds, a Riordan response that stresses his
abortion-rights stand may turn off some antiabortion Republicans, and
acknowledging his past support for antiabortion causes could concern
those who back abortion rights, the Davis campaign surmised.</TE>
<TE>   The danger, of which Riordan strategists were hopeful, is that
voters overall will be turned off by Davis' negative approach.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too bad the governor has decided to go down this desperate
path that's trying to purposely misrepresent the mayor's record,"
Riordan spokeswoman Margita Thompson said. "He's 100% pro-choice."
She did not, however, take issue with the accuracy of Davis' list of
Riordan's contributions.</TE>
<TE>   When asked why Riordan gave to antiabortion groups, Thompson
replied, "Mayor Riordan has spoken about how you don't need to agree
with everyone but you should respect their opinions. So you shouldn't
be surprised when he gives to someone with whom he doesn't fully
agree."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' chief political strategist, Garry South, said Riordan has
been criticizing the governor on the trail for months. "You can kind
of consider us the Shaquille O'Neal of politics," South said,
referring to the punch that landed the Laker center on a recent
suspension. "We're kind of sick and tired of all the constant fouls
and we've decided to fight back."</TE>
<TE>   Davis and Riordan have far outpaced the other two GOP candidates
in fund-raising and name recognition. Riordan has virtually ignored
his primary challengers and stressed his moderate credentials on
abortion, immigration and gay rights in the primary, an unorthodox
strategy but one which could bear fruit in November.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Republican primary contest, it proceeded Friday in
Irvine. All three Republican candidates addressed the Hispanic 100, a
2-month-old group of Orange County business leaders, and the Lincoln
Club, a GOP fund-raising group.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates--Riordan, Secretary of State Bill Jones and Los
Angeles businessman Bill Simon--touted their pro-industry plans and
said they would lower workers' compensation costs and cut regulations
to create jobs.</TE>
<TE>   All three oppose affirmative action but assured the audience of
about 300 that if they hired the most qualified workers, that would
include Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have been courting the growing Latino voter bloc,
which has turned to Democrats since the GOP's embrace in 1994 of the
anti-illegal-immigrant initiative Proposition 187, which denied
benefits to undocumented migrants but was largely neutralized by the
courts.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan and Simon now say they oppose such an initiative. Jones,
who backed it in 1994, says he would modify it to not affect
children.</TE>

<HD>Assembly Bill Targets Global Warming Trend</HD>
<DH>Emissions: The proposal would limit carbon dioxide in
tailpipe exhaust, which affects climate change, scientists say. Vote
must take place by Friday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California could become the first state to regulate gases from cars
and trucks that are linked to global warming, under a bill that state
lawmakers must act on by the end of next week.</LD>
<LD>   Opening a new front in the fight against tailpipe exhaust, the
legislation targets carbon dioxide emitted by the state's 23 million
passenger vehicles. The gas is not traditionally considered a
pollutant, but is implicated by scientists as a major contributor to
global climate change.</LD>
<LD>   The bill is backed by an unusual coalition of Silicon Valley
entrepreneurs, environmentalists, nurses, water officials and some
scientists concerned that global warming could have devastating
effects on people and nature in California. The world's leading auto
makers oppose the bill, however, calling it poorly crafted and an
end-run around federal authorities in charge of auto fuel efficiency
standards.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a grand commotion about global warming, but we're not
about to buy into a regulatory program based on whimsy," said former
Assemblyman and Sacramento Mayor Phil Isenberg, now a lobbyist for
the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents General
Motors, Toyota and Ford Motor Co., among others.</TE>
<TE>   Democrat Fran Pavley, a former schoolteacher from Agoura Hills
elected to the Assembly last year, is sponsor of the bill, AB 1058.
It requires the state Air Resources Board to adopt by January 2004
regulations that achieve the "maximum feasible and cost-effective
reduction" of carbon dioxide from cars and light trucks while
granting automobile manufacturers flexibility "to the maximum extent
feasible." The controls would take effect in January 2005.</TE>
<TE>   "It may just be one state, but we are going to be more impacted by
global warming than other states," Pavley said. "California needs to
take the lead on environmental issues. We've done this in the past
and it would continue our legacy."</TE>
<TE>   But time is running out for the bill. Pavley introduced it last
year and failed to get it to the Assembly floor for a vote. It will
die this year unless the full chamber votes on it before Friday. The
Assembly is scheduled to consider the bill on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Pavley is cautiously confident that she has enough votes this
year. Her opponents in the auto industry say the vote will be close.</TE>
<TE>   California's foray into the global warming debate is part of a
growing effort by local, state and foreign governments to seize the
initiative since President Bush has been reluctant to act. The Bush
administration has reneged on a campaign promise to cut carbon
dioxide emissions and has not supported efforts in Congress to
regulate the gas. The administration also rejected an international
climate change accord--ratified by 180 nations--that it considers a
threat to U.S. jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other emissions, carbon dioxide does not form smog and is
not a direct threat to human health. It is a molecule that absorbs
heat from the sun and, as more of it is released by human activities,
helps to form a blanket of warm air around the planet.</TE>
<TE>   California has been a national leader in cleaning up air
pollution. Unleaded fuel, catalytic converters and alternative-fueled
cars were pioneered here. Scientists at Caltech discovered how
photochemical smog formed. The state is home to some of the world's
most aggressive clean-air controls.</TE>
<TE>   "California is uniquely positioned to do something about this,"
said Dan Sperling, director of the Institute of Transportation
Studies at UC Davis. "The auto industry doesn't have nearly as much
clout in California as it does in other states or in Washington. If
you can't do this here, you can't do it anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Among the strategies available to air quality officials are
providing new incentives to buy fuel-efficient cars, to spend more on
mass transit and ride sharing and to promote the use of low-profile
tires, which reduce wind and road resistance and can improve fuel
economy, said Russell Long, executive director of San Francisco-based
Bluewater Network, which wrote the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The auto industry has long resisted such attempts to change fuel
efficiency standards on the grounds that more fuel-efficient cars
tend to be smaller and lead to more injuries in highway crashes.</TE>
<TE>   In a lawsuit filed last year, auto makers argued that California's
zero-emission vehicle mandate is an attempt to usurp federal
regulation of fuel economy standards. The pending legal challenge is
led by General Motors and joined by DaimlerChrysler, Isuzu Motor Co.
and a group of San Joaquin Valley new car dealers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the only piece of legislation I can recall that orders
[the Air Resources Board] to adopt a regulation with no measures of
success. I can't think of another example where you don't have a
scientific measure or standard to go against," said Isenberg, the
lobbyist.</TE>
<TE>   But supporters of the bill say the stakes are too high to delay
action. California gets more electricity from renewable energy
sources than any other state, and vehicles account for 57% of the
state's carbon dioxide emissions.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists warn that California could experience more damaging
Pacific storms, warmer and smoggier conditions, and more pronounced
cycles of flooding and drought due to global warming. A scientific
panel formed by the United Nations recently concluded that global
temperatures could increase by up to 10 degrees by the end of this
century, although exact effects are difficult to predict, especially
for local areas.</TE>
<TE>   "The single biggest surface water reservoir in California is the
Sierra snowpack," said Jonas Minton, deputy director of the state
Department of Water Resources.</TE>
<TE>   "When temperatures increase," Minton said, "snow levels rise and
more precipitation falls as rain rather than snow, which reduces the
water available as runoff in the spring and summer when we need it.
There is evidence that this phenomenon is already occurring."</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating that a time will come when greenhouse gases are
regulated like other pollutants, the Legislature has established a
registry to track emissions reductions. Business that have
voluntarily cut emissions can record their progress and count it as
credit against future reduction targets.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Epstein, founder of Environmental Entrepreneurs, a coalition
of business leaders from Silicon Valley, said AB 1058 could save
gasoline and money while harnessing innovative new technologies to

<HD>Prisoner Received Heart Transplant</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Total amount associated with treating the
convicted robber could hit $1 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A California prison inmate received a new heart earlier this month in
a transplant operation that could end up costing taxpayers as much as
$1 million, prison officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The operation appears to mark the most extreme application yet of
a court mandate to give prisoners the same standard of medical care
as the average law-abiding patient.</LD>
<LD>   The operation was undertaken at Stanford Medical Center on Jan. 3
but not reported publicly until this week. State prison officials
said they believe the operation was the first heart transplant
performed on a prison inmate, although not the first organ
transplant.</LD>
<TE>   In 1995, a federal court ordered California to give a kidney
transplant to a prison inmate whose request for one had been denied.
Because of that case, correctional officials said they had no choice
but to allow the inmate to undergo the heart transplant.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all we can do under the law," said Stephen Green,
assistant secretary of the state Youth and Adult Correctional Agency.
"We must follow the court's mandate, and that's what we're doing."</TE>
<TE>   Russ Heimerich, a spokesman for the Department of Corrections,
added: "We're not insensitive to the larger issues here. There's the
whole question of how far should we go for inmate medical care.
That's not really a question for us to answer."</TE>
<TE>   It is, however, a question that officials are likely to confront
more often. The number of inmates obtaining organ transplants will
probably rise nationwide in coming years because of the large number
of prisoners who have been diagnosed with hepatitis C and are likely
to need new livers, said Scott Chavez, a spokesman for the National
Commission on Correctional Health Care.</TE>
<TE>   And although heart transplants are very expensive, it is far from
unusual for inmates to cost taxpayers a small fortune in medical
bills, prison officials said. Prisoners are typically far less
healthy than the average person, with vastly higher rates of
substance abuse, hepatitis and AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   "To single out this guy as being expensive--well, a lot of inmates
cost us a lot of money because they're just not in good shape,"
Heimerich said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the United Network on Organ Sharing, the estimated
first-year cost of a heart transplant is $209,100, with annual
follow-up charges of $15,000. Green said the total amount associated
with treating this inmate could climb to $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   The 31-year-old inmate, whose name was withheld because of medical
confidentiality rules, is serving a 14-year sentence for a 1996
robbery in Los Angeles, Green said. A two-time felon, the prisoner
had been at the Salinas Valley State Prison in Soledad. He was
transferred to the prison system's medical unit in Vacaville last
February after repeated hospitalizations.</TE>
<TE>   Green said the man was suffering from heart disease caused by a
viral infection and was ill before being sentenced to prison. Shortly
before the transplant, he had been transferred to a local hospital in
Vacaville and then to Stanford for treatment of congestive heart
failure. He was being kept alive with a cardiac assistive device, a
machine that causes the heart to beat mechanically.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to perform the transplant was made by a committee of
doctors at Stanford, not by the Department of Corrections, Green
said.</TE>
<TE>   News of the operation was first reported Friday in the Sacramento
Bee.</TE>
<TE>   Although heart transplants were once a highly experimental
procedure, they have been considered more or less routine since the
1983 introduction of the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine, the
first medication to effectively block the body's effort to reject
transplanted tissues.</TE>
<TE>   The primary barrier to the procedure now is a serious shortage of
donor organs. According to the Scientific Registry of Transplant
Recipients, there were 2,197 heart transplants in 2000, the last year
for which there are complete data. On Jan. 4, one day after the
inmate received his new heart, there were 4,119 patients on the
waiting list for a donor heart, according to the United Network for
Organ Sharing.</TE>
<TE>   The criteria for who will receive a donor organ include the
patient's overall health other than his heart; whether the patient is
likely to die without a transplant; and whether the patient is likely
to be able to adhere to the lifestyle changes--including complex drug
treatments and frequent examinations--required after a transplant.</TE>
<TE>   Geographic proximity to a potential donor organ and immunological
compatibility are also important considerations.</TE>
<TE>   The criteria do not include whether a person is incarcerated. That
is appropriate, said Renee C. Fox, a bioethicist at the University of
Pennsylvania. Barring inmates from receiving heart transplants would
create ethical problems, Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   The moral standing of a transplant recipient is "ideally
irrelevant," she said. To argue otherwise would risk creating a
system in which each potential recipient is graded according to his
or her moral standing--a decision that most ethicists might argue is
best left to God.</TE>
<TE>   "Should merit be considered a criteria?" Fox asked. "Should organs
go to people who are 'good,' who have lived good lives?"</TE>
<TE>   In this case, said Green, the inmate was chosen over other
potential recipients because the donor was nearby and the two were
considered a good match. Like the recipient, the donor has not been
identified.</TE>
<TE>   Some prison systems have been accused of "dumping" inmates who
require costly medical procedures, using "compassionate release" as a
pretext for getting them off the prison budget. California officials
say they do not use compassionate release that way, but frequently
release prisoners who are believed to have less than a year to live.</TE>
<TE>   The inmate who received the heart transplant had applied for
compassionate release on that basis, but got the new heart before the
request was considered, Heimerich said. Even with the new heart, the
inmate might still be granted release, meaning he may still be
considered terminally ill, the spokesman added.</TE>
<TE>   About 86% of patients survive the first year after a heart
transplant, with survival declining to about 70% after five years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that denial of decent
medical care to prisoners violates the constitutional prohibition
against cruel and unusual punishment. The 1995 federal court decision
ordering a kidney transplant was based on that ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1976, prisoners in several states have received transplants
of organs other than hearts. In one noted case, James Earl Ray, the
man convicted of assassinating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.,
sought a liver transplant. Tennessee officials refused to grant him a
furlough to obtain the operation, and he died a few months later.</TE>

<HD>Davis' Fix Is Like Wilson's Dilemma</HD>
<DH>Budget: The former governor is critical of his successor,
but there are parallels and differences in the crises and the two
men's strategies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Upon taking office in January 1991, Gov. Pete Wilson faced the same
problem Gov. Gray Davis confronts now: a deep budget shortfall and no
easy way out.</LD>
<LD>   Then, as now, costs of welfare, prisons, public schools and other
state-funded programs simply outpaced tax receipts. Three days after
being sworn in, Wilson summed up the situation with an observation
echoed today:</LD>
<LD>   "Fundamentally," he said, "the state suffers from a structural
budget problem."</LD>
<TE>   Initially, the Republican governor thought the shortfall he faced
was $7 billion. By the time he signed his first budget into law in
mid-July 1991, the deficit had ballooned to twice that. To fill the
gap, he agreed to spending cuts and accounting tricks that saved $7
billion, and tax increases intended to raise $7 billion more.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven years later, Wilson hasn't flinched from what he says are
bedrock budget principles. There are three ways to handle a
shortfall, he says: Cut spending, raise taxes, or use a combination
of the two.</TE>
<TE>   Reviewing Davis' proposal to close a shortfall now projected at
$12 billion, Wilson says his Democratic successor has chosen a fourth
alternative--deficit spending--that Wilson contends may be illegal
under state law. At the very least, Wilson says, Davis' budget is a
prescription for tax increases in coming years.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is unconstitutional," Wilson said in an interview.
"Even if it were legally permissible, it is terrible economic policy.
Talk about undermining not just your credit with the rating agencies.
. . . Anybody with a brain that looks at this situation sees the
almost certainty of future tax increases."</TE>
<TE>   Susan Kennedy, a top Davis aide, responded by calling Wilson "the
king of budget gimmicks." She defended Davis' proposal to fill the
$12-billion gap by cutting $5.2 billion, seeking $1.1 billion from
the federal government and raising more than $5.6 billion through
loans, transfers and other accounting mechanisms.</TE>
<TE>   "Every governor faced with a deficit of any magnitude has used
every financial tool at their disposal," Kennedy said. "In many ways,
Gov. Wilson cut the path. He was a trailblazer. You can't accuse
[Davis] of pushing the problem off to any colossal degree."</TE>
<TE>   The budget decisions Wilson made in his first years in office
ended up shaping much of his tenure. He angered conservatives in his
own party by raising taxes, and alienated influential interest
groups, particularly education lobbyists and state workers, with his
decisions to cut state programs and limit pay raises.</TE>
<TE>   Three years out of office, Wilson, 68, is a fellow at the Hoover
Institution at Stanford University and an appointee of President Bush
to defense policy and intelligence oversight boards.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, some Republicans try to distance themselves from Wilson,
worried that his vocal opposition to illegal
immigration--particularly state costs associated with it--alienated
Latino voters.</TE>
<TE>   But he remains the last Republican to win major statewide office
in California. And as the state faces a new deficit, some Capitol
veterans praise Wilson's handling of state finances during the
recession. At a hearing this week, Senate Budget Committee Chairman
Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) said Wilson had shown "courageous
leadership."</TE>
<TE>   "He managed to get us through," Peace said. "We did not cut
funding for core programs."</TE>
<TE>   There are parallels between Wilson's and Davis' budget crises and
their strategies; there are also differences. One is scale.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, the general fund budget, which relies
primarily on taxes Californians pay on personal income, retail sales
and corporate profits, was about $40 billion. With the sputtering
economy wreaking havoc on state finances during Wilson's entire first
term, the general fund, which pays for most state programs, shrank.</TE>
<TE>   Today the general fund is nearly twice the size of Wilson's. The
spending plan that Davis offered earlier this month calls for a
slight increase in the general fund from the current year--to $78.8
billion in the fiscal year that begins July 1, up from $78.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Another difference involves timing. Wilson faced a deficit during
his first year in office, and smaller though still
multibillion-dollar deficits in following years. By 1994 when Wilson
was running for reelection, the economy, although still slow, was
recovering.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is dealing with a slowing economy and a budget deficit at
the same time that he and most legislators must face voters. He
cannot afford a budget impasse that drags on through the summer, when
he otherwise would be on the campaign trail.</TE>
<TE>   "[Davis] may be facing a tough election fight," Wilson said. "It
doesn't change the dynamics of the situation. If his choice is to
decide whether he is going to do what's best for himself or what's
best for the state, he should chose what's best for the state."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' Aide Dismisses</TE>
<TE>   Wilson's Criticism</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy dismissed Wilson's suggestion that Davis is postponing
such hard decisions as imposing unpopular spending cuts or tax
increases until after the November election. The budget, she noted,
is sure to change when revenue estimates become firm after people pay
their income taxes in April.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you slash the safety net by several billion dollars in
anticipation of a problem two years from now?" Kennedy asked. "Do you
raise taxes to solve a problem two years from now?"</TE>
<TE>   Among the similarities between Davis' quandary and the one Wilson
faced in the early 1990s are the governors' approaches to cuts. Davis
is calling on the Legislature to freeze annual cost-of-living raises
for people on welfare, a proposal decried by some Democrats. Wilson
not only froze cost-of-living increases, but also presided over
reductions in monthly welfare checks.</TE>
<TE>   In another similarity, Davis, like Wilson, is seeking help from
Washington. Wilson in 1994 demanded $3.1 billion in federal
assistance to cover costs associated with illegal immigration. He got
a fraction of that sum.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a political decision to go after the federal government
for $3.1 billion; it bought him time," Kennedy said. "But for
[Wilson] to have that as part of his portfolio of solutions and
criticize this governor is a farce."</TE>
<TE>   Davis is seeking $1.1 billion, including $400 million more for
health care for poor people and $350 million in costs related to
security against terrorism. Unlike Wilson, Davis has not publicly
identified cuts that he will impose if the money does not come.</TE>
<TE>   "It was worse than pulling teeth," Wilson said of his efforts to
persuade Congress to come to California's aid.</TE>
<TE>   Both governors also sought to borrow money, as did governors
before them.</TE>
<TE>   By far the bulk of Wilson's borrowing was short-term, spread over
a year or two. Like Wilson, Davis is turning to the massive state
pension funds, though he is seeking more. He proposes to skip $2
billion in payments to the pension funds of teachers and state
employees. If approved, the move could result in $10 billion in
principal and interest costs and improved benefits, spread over 30
years, Davis' Department of Finance estimates.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Davis proposes to obtain $2.4 billion this year by
selling a long-term bond to be repaid from the state's $500-million
annual share of the 1998 national tobacco litigation settlement. The
administration places the annual cost of borrowing against the
settlement at $190 million for 22 years. The tobacco money currently
is used for a variety of health care programs.</TE>
<TE>   Governors' Budgets</TE>
<TE>   Finance Their Legacies</TE>
<TE>   As Davis faces his first shortfall, the warnings sound a lot like
the observation in Wilson's first budget about the need for
structural changes. The nonpartisan legislative analyst's office said
in a recent report that unless "corrective actions" are taken--deeper
spending cuts and tax increases are two such steps--California will
face deficits for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   Governors and lawmakers use budgets to finance their priorities
and their legacies. In the process, they sometimes saddle incoming
governors with costs. Wilson rolled back taxes in his final budgets,
all but erasing tax increases he presided over in his first year.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Wilson's tax cuts took effect in Davis' first years. In
1999 and 2000, however, California's economy was so strong that Davis
enjoyed record surpluses and even used the surplus to increase
spending.</TE>
<TE>   General-fund spending grew almost 36% during Davis' first three
years, rising more than $20 billion, with public schools, the issue
that Davis has focused on more than any other, receiving almost a
third of that sum.</TE>
<TE>   During Wilson's eight years, general-fund spending rose 43%, to
$57 billion. In his view, the pace cannot continue.</TE>
<TE>   "They have been spending at a merry rate," Wilson said of his
successors. "The same people who were full of new ideas as to how to
spend the bonanza obviously are not very good candidates for people
who will reduce it. But that is what they have to do."</TE>

<HD>Judge Refuses to Set Trial Date for Hells Angels</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Drug case won't begin until lawyers agree they've
had time to prepare.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attorneys for several defendants in the massive Hells Angels drug and
racketeering case lost their bid Friday to receive a trial date in
March 2003.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Bruce Clark said it would be "premature" to set a trial date
until lawyers for all nine defendants at Friday's hearing felt they
had adequate time to prepare. The defendants are jointly charged and
prosecutors plan to try them together.</LD>
<LD>   The decision disappointed attorney Scott Spindel, who said he
could be ready for trial in 14 months. Spindel said lawyers must pore
over an extraordinary volume of material, including 120,000 pages of
court documents, 13,000 pages of grand jury transcripts and about 200
videotapes.</LD>
<TE>   Spindel represents Kenneth Collins, who is facing a variety of
charges stemming from alleged drug sales.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, defendant George Christie Jr., leader of
the Hells Angels in Ventura, declined to comment on the case. After
being jailed for 11 months, he was released on $1-million bail
earlier this month but must remain at his home except for court
appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Christie said he plans to ask for permission to visit his
terminally ill mother.</TE>
<TE>   "She's had to get out of her deathbed to visit me," said Christie,
54, who must wear an electronic monitoring bracelet at all times.</TE>
<TE>   Another hearing on a trial date was set for May 2.</TE>

<HD>Radio Executive to Receive Award</HD>
<DH>Leadership: Camarillo broadcaster Alfredo Plascencia is
one of seven to be honored by Latino advocacy group.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The work ethic came early to Alfredo Plascencia.</LD>
<LD>   First there was the example set by his father, a Mexican immigrant
who worked long hours in the citrus orchards of Ventura County. Then
came his own early work experience cleaning up construction sites,
starting when he was in high school.</LD>
<LD>   So when the opportunity came in 1991 to become a partner in
Oxnard's Spanish-language Radio Lazer (KXLM-FM, 102.9), he didn't
think twice about the time he would have to put in--seven days a
week--to make the station a success.</LD>
<TE>   Within a year it was one of the highest-rated radio stations in
the county, and it has since become a vital link for news and
information for the Spanish-speaking community.</TE>
<TE>   As a business leader, the Camarillo father of three went on to
help launch Destino 2000, a charitable endowment that provides grants
for Ventura County groups serving the Latino community.</TE>
<TE>   For his achievements, Plascencia will be honored next month by El
Concilio del Condado de Ventura, the county's largest Latino advocacy
group.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a reflection of years and years of hard work, but
also of giving back to the community," said Plascencia, 41, now sole
owner of Radio Lazer and 10 other stations from San Bernardino to San
Luis Obispo. "I think it just comes with being involved with the
community."</TE>
<TE>   Plascencia is one of seven people set to receive El Concilio's
leadership awards, presented annually to people who have demonstrated
a commitment to volunteerism and to enriching the county's Latino
community.</TE>
<TE>   The awards ceremony is to begin at 6:30 p.m. Feb. 23 at the Oxnard
Performing Arts Center.</TE>
<TE>   This year's honorees include:</TE>
<TE>   * Youth leader Gloria Michelle Chinea, a senior at Oxnard High
School and president of the school's Associated Student Body. As
junior class president, Chinea raised thousands of dollars for school
activities. She also has participated in the President's Leadership
Conference and was invited to take part in the Presidential Classroom
program in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   * Santa Paula's Joe Duran, business representative of the
Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters. In the last 20 years, Duran
has served in numerous positions with the United Brotherhood of
Carpenters and as a delegate to the Ventura County Building and
Trades Council. In 1994, he was the first Latino to be elected
president of the union's Local 150.</TE>
<TE>   * Oxnard School District Facilities Director Sal Godoy is being
recognized for his contributions toward building a community gym and
new elementary school campuses in El Rio.</TE>
<TE>   The Oxnard native, who earned a bachelor's degree in architecture
from USC in 1975 and a master's in the same field from UC Berkeley
two years later, served as facilities director in El Rio for five
years. He said he was gratified to be recognized for his work in
obtaining construction money for the rapidly growing district.</TE>
<TE>   "It reassured me that facilities are an important part of
education," he said. "I've seen what the needs are of the youngsters
in our community, and I've worked really hard to really ring the bell
for underprivileged youth."</TE>
<TE>   * Oxnard housing official Karl Lawson is being honored for his
contributions to numerous "get-out-the-vote" campaigns and census
outreach efforts. Lawson, who will receive El Concilio's community
service award, also was a key member of Ventura County's
Redistricting Task Force, a coalition created to ensure Latino
political representation.</TE>
<TE>   * Ventura County Probation Officer Peter Martinez will receive El
Concilio's award for leadership in the arts for his efforts to boost
the profile of Latino artists and musicians.</TE>
<TE>   A member of the board of Oxnard's Carnegie Art Museum and
president of its fund-raising arm, Martinez has been instrumental in
showcasing the work of prominent Chicano artists. He said that has
been especially significant for youngsters in the largely Latino
community, who through school tours and other programs are exposed to
a world they knew little about.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth of the matter is, most children in this community are
not going to be able to travel to a major museum," he said, "so why
not bring a major museum to this community?"</TE>
<TE>   * Dr. Miguel Cervantes is being recognized for his achievements in
health care, but he said he considers the El Concilio award a
reflection on the good work his clinic has done.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, he helped launch Las Islas Family Clinic in south Oxnard,
overseeing a staff of doctors and employees who treat more than
50,000 patients a year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great honor," said Cervantes, who also helps teach young
doctors studying in the county hospital's family practice program.
"But certainly it's an award for Las Islas as a whole, rather than
for me personally."</TE>
<TE>   Cervantes comes from a farm worker family--his father worked the
fields for nearly 40 years and his mother still works part time
packing peppers. And he spent many hours working the fields himself.</TE>
<TE>   A straight-A student at Camarillo High School, Cervantes melded
long hours of study and government aid to get through UCLA's
undergraduate program, then its vaunted medical school, before
entering the nationally recognized family practice residency program
at Ventura County Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   He was nominated for the award by a former clinic colleague.</TE>
<TE>   "It was quite a surprise," he said. "It's nice, but I don't know
what I did to deserve it."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to individual awards, the Latino advocacy group for
the first time will present a President's Award. The inaugural
winners are the Filipino-American Council and the Ventura County
Community Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   To make reservations for the awards ceremony or for information,
call El Concilio at 486-9777.</TE>

<HD>Lane Trails Mikels in Raising Funds for Supervisor's Race</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County supervisor candidate John Lane received a $10,000
contribution from a union representing sheriff's deputies, records
show.</LD>
<LD>   The labor group was Lane's only monetary donor during the
three-week period ended Jan. 19. House Graphics in Costa Mesa gave
Lane campaign signs worth $1,896.</LD>
<LD>   Lane, a Moorpark fraud investigator, is attempting to unseat 4th
District Supervisor Judy Mikels in the March 5 primary. He is backed
mostly by law enforcement unions.</LD>
<TE>   The Ventura County Deputy Sheriffs' Assn. has contributed a total
of $15,000, about a third of Lane's $47,000 campaign chest. Mikels,
seeking a third term in the Simi Valley-based district, has raised
slightly more than $75,000.</TE>
<TE>   In the race to replace retiring county Clerk-Recorder Richard
Dean, educator Yvonne Bodle raised $12,000 for the period, $11,000 of
that in a loan to herself. Assistant Clerk-Recorder Phil J. Schmit
reported $1,406 in contributions, $537 in a loan to himself. Jackie
Rodgers, former county GOP chairwoman, reported $504 in
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Treasurer-Tax Collector Larry Matheney raised $10,900 in
his quest to replace the retiring Treasurer-Tax Collector Harold S.
Pittman. Matheney's total contributions are $61,000. His opponent,
former Thousand Oaks City Councilman Mike Markey, reported a $1,600
loan to himself.</TE>

<HD>Father, Judge Not Swayed by Killer's Pleas</HD>
<DH>Court: Roland 'Ram' Gonzales tearfully asks the parents of
his victim to forgive him, and claims his trial was unfair. He is
sentenced to 16 years to life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before he was sentenced to state prison for murdering his ex-wife's
boyfriend, 43-year-old Thousand Oaks resident Roland "Ram" Gonzales
asked permission from the court to say a few words.</LD>
<LD>   Turning to face his victim's parents, Gonzales told them he never
meant to kill their son, 34-year-old David Smith. Then he complained
that he didn't get a fair trial.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, he wept and begged for forgiveness.</LD>
<TE>   "What really hurts is that I know how much you miss him," Gonzales
said Friday, sobbing during his sentencing hearing in Ventura County
Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   "I never wanted this to happen," he said. "I just wish you could
forgive me in some way."</TE>
<TE>   But the tearful plea came too late for Thousand Oaks resident
Daryl Smith, the victim's father, who gripped his cane and stared
icily at Gonzales across the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   And it did nothing to soften the resolve of Superior Court Judge
Vincent J. O'Neill Jr., who ordered Gonzales to serve 16 years to
life in prison for sticking a 3 1/2-inch knife blade into David Smith
during a domestic dispute more than two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   After the hearing, Gonzales requested a brief visit with his
parents, who were in the courtroom, but he was denied.</TE>
<TE>   It was all too much for Daryl Smith to stomach.</TE>
<TE>   "His parents can go visit him in prison," the father said angrily,
standing outside the courtroom. "All I can remember are the autopsy
photos."</TE>
<TE>   David Smith died in November 1999 after a confrontation with
Gonzales on the front steps of his girlfriend's Thousand Oaks home.
The three adults had a history of ill will and tension. Court records
reveal more than one restraining order.</TE>
<TE>   The bad feelings boiled over that Sunday evening when Gonzales
came to return his two young sons to their mother and found out about
a domestic disturbance between his ex-wife and Smith.</TE>
<TE>   At trial, Gonzales testified that he had grabbed a knife in
self-defense before walking from his vehicle to the front door. He
told jurors that Smith accidentally fell on the blade while trying to
punch him.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Richard Hanawalt portrayed Smith as a drunken
aggressor and described his client as a nonviolent "cream puff."
Hanawalt argued that Gonzales should be convicted of nothing more
serious than manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   But Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan Aramesh told jurors that it was a
first-degree murder case because Gonzales announced moments before
the stabbing that he intended to "stick" Smith.</TE>
<TE>   After the stabbing, she told the jury, Gonzales grabbed his sons
and drove away. Deputies later arrested him at a Westlake Village
hotel, and authorities found the knife in a trash can.</TE>
<TE>   After several days of deliberation in November, the jury returned
with a verdict of second-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   During Friday's sentencing hearing, Hanawalt argued unsuccessfully
for a new trial.</TE>
<TE>   He said the jury's verdict was tainted by a "runaway" foreman who
exerted too much influence and who pushed for a murder conviction
after using a cardboard cracker box as a stand-in for the victim in
the deliberation room.</TE>
<TE>   The judge found there was no coercion, however, and disagreed with
Hanawalt's version of the deliberations based on written declarations
from several jurors.</TE>
<TE>   Holding up the knife with a gloved hand, O'Neill said, "I find it
to be obviously and clearly a lethal weapon."</TE>
<TE>   Later in the hearing, Smith's parents and his former wife, Stella
Violano, described Smith as a gentle man whose character wrongly came
under attack during the trial.</TE>
<TE>   Violano told the judge that her 9-year-old daughter will grow up
without her father because of the defendant's actions.</TE>
<TE>   Her words were echoed by Smith's mother, Susan.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened to David shouldn't have happened," she said through
tears. "We are all serving a life sentence for what Ram did."</TE>

<LD>Six Ventura County sheriff's deputies who shot a knife-wielding
Thousand Oaks man more than two dozen times last year were cleared of
wrongdoing Friday by the county district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas Patton, 56, was shot and killed last October after a
dispute with his wife. Patton allegedly confronted deputies with a
12-inch kitchen knife and failed to obey commands to drop the knife.</LD>
<LD>   When Patton lunged, the deputies all fired, hitting him 26 times.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators said a reasonable person could conclude deadly force
was necessary to stop the attacker. Patton, they said, was given
ample chance to surrender but he remained a threat.</TE>

<HD>Riordan and Davis Trade TV Attack Ads</HD>
<DH>Politics: Governor criticizes past support of antiabortion
candidates and groups by the GOP front-runner, who airs his response.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK  and JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the first clash between the front-runners in the race for
governor, Gov. Gray Davis launched a 30-second television ad Friday
night criticizing former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan for his
past support of antiabortion candidates and organizations.</LD>
<LD>   Riordan, a Republican who has touted support for abortion rights
as he seeks to appeal to Democrats and independents, responded with
his own ad. He said Davis had "chosen to attack me personally" and
that "Californians deserve better."</LD>
<LD>   The alternating salvos came 39 days before the Republican party
formally selects its nominee to challenge Davis in November, and
served to reflect the commanding lead Riordan has opened up in the
primary.</LD>
<TE>   "Where does Richard Riordan really stand on a woman's right to
choose?" asks Davis' 30-second spot, which replaces the biographical
ads Davis has aired statewide since last week.</TE>
<TE>   Among its criticisms, it says Riordan gave money to antiabortion
candidates "as recently as 2001." That was a reference to Riordan's
contribution to Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan also raised $500,000 to back the failed 1987 effort to win
Judge Robert Bork--a longtime critic of the landmark abortion-rights
decision Roe v. Wade--a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court, and
contributed money to the antiabortion groups Americans United for
Life and the Right to Life League.</TE>
<TE>   "Riordan," the spot concludes. "Is this a record we can trust?"</TE>
<TE>   The ad does not mention that the most recent of the contributions
to the antiabortion groups was in 1991, a $10,000 gift from a
foundation established by Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   The Riordan campaign's response was filmed in December, in
anticipation of a Davis attack.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in taking responsibility and being accountable.
Unfortunately, Gov. Davis thinks differently," Riordan says in the
segment. "Instead of outlining his plans for our future, he has
chosen to attack me personally."</TE>
<TE>   Looking directly into the camera, he added a gibe at Davis'
governance: "We have a huge budget deficit, jobs leaving our state
and children underperforming in our schools."</TE>
<TE>   According to those familiar with the ads, the Davis campaign is
spending about $1.5 million per week on its ad, and the Riordan
response will cost somewhat less, about $1 million per week.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is unusual for incumbents to fire across party lines
before the primary, there has been a model in recent California
history, cited Friday by the Davis campaign: Former Gov. Pete Wilson
ran ads on the immigration stance of Democrat Kathleen Brown before
her primary in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson's strategy was to force Brown into a position of angering
some part of her constituency no matter how she responded.</TE>
<TE>   In the same fashion, the Davis camp is attempting to carve away
support for Riordan among moderates and some Democrats who were
attracted to the former mayor's middle-of-the-road social stands.
They also want to call into question his characterizations of his
record.</TE>
<TE>   As the campaign unfolds, a Riordan response that stresses his
abortion-rights stand may turn off some antiabortion Republicans, and
acknowledging his past support for antiabortion causes could concern
those who back abortion rights, the Davis campaign surmised.</TE>
<TE>   The danger, of which Riordan strategists were hopeful, is that
voters overall will be turned off by Davis' negative approach.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too bad the governor has decided to go down this desperate
path that's trying to purposely misrepresent the mayor's record,"
Riordan spokeswoman Margita Thompson said. "He's 100% pro-choice."
She did not, however, take issue with the accuracy of Davis' list of
Riordan's contributions.</TE>
<TE>   When asked why Riordan gave to antiabortion groups, Thompson
replied, "Mayor Riordan has spoken about how you don't need to agree
with everyone but you should respect their opinions. So you shouldn't
be surprised when he gives to someone with whom he doesn't fully
agree."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' chief political strategist, Garry South, said Riordan has
been criticizing the governor on the trail for months. "You can kind
of consider us the Shaquille O'Neal of politics," South said,
referring to the punch that landed the Laker center on a recent
suspension. "We're kind of sick and tired of all the constant fouls
and we've decided to fight back."</TE>
<TE>   Davis and Riordan have far outpaced the other two GOP candidates
in fund-raising and name recognition. Riordan has virtually ignored
his primary challengers and stressed his moderate credentials on
abortion, immigration and gay rights in the primary, an unorthodox
strategy but one which could bear fruit in November.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Republican primary contest, it proceeded Friday in
Irvine. All three Republican candidates addressed the Hispanic 100, a
2-month-old group of Orange County business leaders, and the Lincoln
Club, a GOP fund-raising group.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates--Riordan, Secretary of State Bill Jones and Los
Angeles businessman Bill Simon--touted their pro-industry plans and
said they would lower workers' compensation costs and cut regulations
to create jobs.</TE>
<TE>   All three oppose affirmative action but assured the audience of
about 300 that if they hired the most qualified workers, that would
include Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have been courting the growing Latino voter bloc,
which has turned to Democrats since the GOP's embrace in 1994 of the
anti-illegal-immigrant initiative Proposition 187, which denied
benefits to undocumented migrants but was largely neutralized by the
courts.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan and Simon now say they oppose such an initiative. Jones,
who backed it in 1994, says he would modify it to not affect
children.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Nicholas Riccardi contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Canyon Fire Fully Contained</HD>
<DH>Safety: Historic structures were threatened, but weather
helps keep damage to 100 acres. Evacuees return as roads are
reopened.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The 100-acre brush fire that threatened historic cabins in the Orange
County back country has been fully contained, authorities said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze started Wednesday afternoon in the Holy Jim Canyon area
of the Cleveland National Forest. A crew of 500 firefighters was
hampered by steep terrain but helped eventually by a change in the
weather Thursday and Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "There was an onshore flow, which raised the humidity," said Kathy
Bacon of the U.S. Forest Service.</LD>
<TE>   The overall lack of humidity in Southern California is a major
concern to fire officials.</TE>
<TE>   "We are way below normal in our rainfall down in the southern part
of the state," Bacon said. "Unless we pick up in February, we have
the potential to have a pretty terrific fire season."</TE>
<TE>   The region's fire season typically begins in July or August.</TE>
<TE>   The canyon blaze, which started near Holy Jim Canyon Road, was
caused by human error, authorities said. Some residents said it might
have been sparked by a barbecue.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was whipped by roaring winds and came close to 50 rustic
dwellings in the Holy Jim Canyon and Trabuco Canyon areas.
Twenty-five to 35 people were evacuated, and two firefighters had
minor injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Among those fighting the blaze were crews from the Orange County
Fire Authority, Los Angeles County Fire Department, U.S. Forest
Service and the California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters used five water-dropping helicopters to fight the
flames, which burned furiously until the winds changed early
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Evacuated residents were allowed to return Thursday afternoon, and
all roads were opened by that night, authorities said.</TE>

<HD>Funding for El Toro Airport Foes Tops $550,000</HD>
<DH>Land use: Money flows into campaign, while proponents lag
behind.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Opponents of the county's plans for an El Toro airport have raised
more than $550,000--$98,000 of it in early January--in support of
Measure W, the park initiative on the March ballot, according to
campaign reports.</LD>
<LD>   If approved, Measure W would replace airport zoning at the
4,700-acre former Marine base with zoning for an urban park,
university complex and sports fields.</LD>
<LD>   The majority of the "Yes on Measure W" funds will pay for mailers
to highlight the park alternative, and for posters, television ads
and voter registration pushes, said Leonard Kranser, a spokesman for
the Measure W drive.</LD>
<TE>   The filing period covers the first 19 days of January. Kranser
said the campaign hopes to raise an additional $1 million before the
election.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a challenge because most of our donations come in small
checks but from large numbers of people. But it's our goal," Kranser
said. A spokesman for "No on the Great Tax--Measure W" said that
group did not raise more than $1,000--the reporting threshold--during
the filing period.</TE>
<TE>   In the race between Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad and challenger
Chris Norby, a Fullerton councilman, Coad reported raising $95,700 in
the first weeks of this year, $90,000 of it in personal loans from
herself.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Coad raised $653,700, mostly in personal loans.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Norby has raised $27,725 this year, mostly from South
County residents who support him because of his anti-airport stand.
Norby has about $64,000 in his political war chest.</TE>
<TE>   In the race for district attorney, incumbent Tony Rackauckas
reported raising $3,375, while challenger Senior Assistant Dist.
Atty. Wally Wade raised $28,430.</TE>
<TE>   For 2001, Rackauckas raised about $200,000 more than his opponent.</TE>

<HD>Costa Mesa High Hit by 3rd Arson This Month</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fire officials Friday were investigating a suspicious blaze at Costa
Mesa High School, the third such incident this month.</LD>
<LD>   The fire gutted a classroom for hearing-impaired students at the
school at 2650 Fairview Ave., said Connie Duddridge, risk manager for
the Newport-Mesa Unified School District.</LD>
<LD>   "Somebody's got a problem, and we're taking this very seriously,"
Duddridge said.</LD>
<TE>   A janitor spotted flames about 8:30 p.m. Thursday and called for
help. The building's brick walls helped contain the fire to one
classroom. Although firefighters had the blaze under control within
13 minutes, it caused about $70,000 in damage, Battalion Chief Gregg
Steward said.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the class's 13 students were moved to another room
while investigators sifted through charred desks, computers and books
for clues. Also, an arson dog searched for liquids and chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   "Three fires in three weeks, that's very suspicious," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The two previous fires damaged portable toilets on the football
field.</TE>

<HD>Capriati Melts Down Hingis to Take Title</HD>
<DH>Australian Open: The American overcomes four match points
and a 4-0 second-set deficit to win in three sets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>It took the greatest moments, along with the worst, from a certain
Grand Slam tournament in France, to produce a historic final between
Jennifer Capriati and Martina Hingis.</LD>
<LD>   Capriati and Hingis were influenced by their Paris past in the
Australian Open. It was as though the ingredients for this final came
from France and were mixed in a blender. And out came a classic as
the defending champion and top-seeded Capriati survived four match
points and a 4-0 deficit in the second set, defeating No. 3 Hingis,
4-6, 7-6 (7), 6-2, in 2 hours 10 minutes on a day when temperatures
neared 100 degrees in a rematch of last year's women's final.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first time in 46 years in a final that a female player
survived a match point and won in Australia. In 1956, Mary Carter
defeated Thelma Long after holding match point. The last time it
happened in the final of any Slam for women came in 1962 when
Margaret Court came back to beat Lesley Turner in Paris.</LD>
<TE>   Here, the foundation for a memorable encounter seemed to come from
two French Open finals. Last year, Capriati did not play well in the
beginning and dug deep, finding a new level of strength, beating Kim
Clijsters, 12-10, in the third set.</TE>
<TE>   As for Hingis, this was a reminder of her close call in the 1999
French Open final. She was three points from winning against Steffi
Graf, and served for the match before unraveling in a petulant mess.
Until today, that was as close as she had come to winning a Grand
Slam since her Australian Open title in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of a complete mental meltdown, Hingis had a physical one
today. She needed an injury timeout in the third set, suffering from
cramps and heat exhaustion, winning only three points in the final
three games after the treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati didn't quite know how she won her third Grand Slam title,
her first since the French Open in June. "I couldn't believe finally
that I won," she said. "Maybe I thought the third set would be a lot
harder. I was cruising in the third set because Martina didn't feel
well. The first one was great, but to come back and win like this, I
don't know what's better."</TE>
<TE>   Raw emotions were running through the 21-year-old Hingis, who was
appearing in her sixth consecutive Australian Open final.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm overwhelmed with feelings," she said. "Jennifer was
too good today. Maybe if we had the Heineken beer in the cooler, it
would help me to make the final point.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know whether to be happy or to cry. I think I've got to
choose. I just have to look forward."</TE>
<TE>   Capriati, 25, made a joke about the beer during the on-court
trophy ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know if I was going to make it. Actually I was drinking
Heineken. You just didn't know it," she said, laughing. "Martina, you
are a great champion. It's going to take a while to get to your
status, being here six times. It's a tremendous effort. I don't know
how I won."</TE>
<TE>   It was easier for her to describe how she got out of trouble.
Capriati simply refused to play it safe on the match points against
her. The first one came at 5-3 in the second set with Hingis serving
for it. Capriati smacked a hard cross-court backhand winner on the
match point and escaped with the game when Hingis double-faulted on
break point.</TE>
<TE>   The next one came in the 12th game, with Capriati serving. She
survived by crushing a hard forehand, which drew an error from
Hingis. The third one came in that same game when Hingis hit a
forehand passing shot long off a Capriati volley.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Hingis' fourth match point came during a tense rally in
the tiebreaker when Hingis hit a backhand long. That made it 7-7 in
the tiebreaker, and Capriati forced the third set when Hingis missed
a volley and hit a backhand wide.</TE>
<TE>   The heat and the missed four match points caused Hingis to erupt.
She threw her racket to the side of the court, getting pretty decent
distance with the toss.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept fighting on those match points I was down," Capriati said.
"I went for it. I don't know why I didn't play like that when I was
ahead. The heat was incredible. You saw the way we were sitting down
between points. I got a second wind, third wind, fourth wind. I don't
know how many winds I had."</TE>
<TE>   Because the temperature was close to 100, the extreme heat policy
rule was invoked and the players took a 10-minute break after the
second set. Hingis changed clothes. Capriati did not, saying: "I
forgot to bring another outfit."</TE>
<TE>   After she finished with such a flourish, her celebration was a lot
like last year in Melbourne. Capriati clasped hands with her father
Stefano and spoke on the cell phone with her brother Steven, who was
home. This time, her mother, Denise, was able to share in the
Australian victory.</TE>
<TE>   "She was very brave," Stefano said. "Without a heart, she couldn't
go through this match."</TE>

<HD>Mosley Fighting Under Radar</HD>
<DH>Boxing: It's another small venue, as unbeaten welterweight
champion faces Forrest, who is looking to repeat his victory at the
1992 Olympic trials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>They held a boxing news conference here this week.</LD>
<LD>   No, not that news conference.</LD>
<LD>   This one didn't involve fists and jaws, merely some mild verbal
jabbing.</LD>
<TE>   This one didn't result in tables being overturned. As a matter of
fact, they didn't even have tables. Or a dais. Just a few stools for
the participants.</TE>
<TE>   Lost in the furor over the Mike Tyson-Lennox Lewis brawl in
midtown Manhattan earlier this week has been tonight's Shane
Mosley-Vernon Forrest welterweight title fight at the Theater, a cozy
5,000-seat venue next to the main arena at Madison Square Garden.</TE>
<TE>   Low-key news conference. Small site. Underdog opponent.</TE>
<TE>   No pay-per-view.</TE>
<TE>   Business, disappointing though it may be, as usual for Mosley.</TE>
<TE>   Most boxing experts rank him as the best pound-for-pound fighter
in the world. At 38-0 with 35 knockouts, he passed his toughest test
in June 2000 by winning a split decision over Oscar De La Hoya.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, it has been one outclassed opponent after
another--Antonio Diaz, followed by Shannan Taylor, followed by Adrian
Stone.</TE>
<TE>   There is, however, some intrigue about tonight's match, which
begins on HBO at 6:30. Forrest has beaten Mosley. Of that, there can
be no doubt. The two met as amateurs in the light-welterweight
semifinals of the 1992 U.S. Olympic trials.</TE>
<TE>   Because no one has produced a tape of that fight, the particulars
are in dispute. Forrest says he knocked Mosley down. Mosley says it
was a slip.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows I knocked him down," Forrest said. "I hit him
right on the button. There's an AP photo that shows him stretched
out."</TE>
<TE>   Forrest says he proved he was the superior fighter. Mosley says he
caused his own problems in that fight.</TE>
<TE>   "He came out doing what does," Forrest said. "I hurt him, just
took him to school and gave him a lesson. It was Boxing 101."</TE>
<TE>   Countered Mosley: "I made it a lot harder than it should have
been. Mentally, I wasn't where I am today. I had some growing up to
do. It's my fault. I did that to myself."</TE>
<TE>   Forrest says the edge he had a decade ago remains. Mosley says he
is now a decidedly better fighter than Forrest.</TE>
<TE>   Forrest says he will win.</TE>
<TE>   Mosley doesn't agree with that.</TE>
<TE>   "Shane has too much power, too much speed," said his father, Jack,
who serves as his trainer. "Vernon will see that when he gets hit by
Shane's power.</TE>
<TE>   "This not 1992.... It's 2002."</TE>
<TE>   The fight will be for Mosley's World Boxing Council title. Mosley
weighed in at 146 pounds Friday, Forrest at 147.</TE>
<TE>   Forrest won the International Boxing Federation welterweight crown
last year by winning a decision over Raul Frank, but he was stripped
when he took the Mosley fight.</TE>
<TE>   As an amateur, Forrest had a record of 225-16. His victory over
Mosley led him to the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, but he lost his
first-round match, saying afterward he had been suffering from food
poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   Forrest is 33-0 with 26 knockouts as a professional. But Frank and
Vince Phillips are his only relatively well-known opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Tyson-Lewis, there is no animosity evident between Mosley
and Forrest. There is never much animosity in a Mosley fight. It's
not his nature.</TE>
<TE>   So it was a little unusual to hear Mosley trashing Forrest for his
travel schedule leading up to tonight, although it is true Forrest
has followed a curious trail over the last month and a half.</TE>
<TE>   Forrest went from his home in Georgia to train in Big Bear. Then
to New York to promote the fight. Then back to Big Bear. Then back
home to Georgia for Christmas. Then back to Big Bear. And finally
here to New York, arriving in midweek.</TE>
<TE>   "You do the math," said Mosley, who has been here for two weeks.
"You've got to get over the sniffles you can get when you change
climates like this. And you get a little tired when you change time
zones."</TE>
<TE>   Forrest laughed when Mosley's criticism was relayed to him.</TE>
<TE>   "I came into his training area and rented a house near him,"
Forrest said, "because I wanted the nightmare he had 10 years ago to
come back. I wanted him to see my face and have that nightmare every
day and every night."</TE>
<TE>   When the fight is over, Forrest says, the media will also have to
face a nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to have a pot of crow ready," he said. "All you media
guys can eat some."</TE>
<TE>   The semi-main event matches 140-pounders Arturo Gatti (33-5, 27),
a former IBF junior-lightweight champion, and Terronn Millett
(26-2-1, 19).</TE>

<HD>Tyson Not Worth the Trouble</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>If he is bloodthirsty, what are they?</LD>
<LD>   If his values and sense of decency are out of whack, so are
theirs.</LD>
<LD>   If we want to understand him, we need only look at their faces.</LD>
<TE>   The saddest sight, and the most enlightening, Tuesday afternoon in
midtown Manhattan was not the brawl initiated by Mike Tyson on the
stage of the Hudson Theater in the Millennium Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   It was the friendly crowd that surged around him as he made a
victory lap around the block afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson's act long ago became old and repugnant. Tuesday didn't plow
any new ground.</TE>
<TE>   On the Hudson stage to promote his April 6 fight against
heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis, the former two-time heavyweight
champ charged Lewis as he walked onstage, and took a swing at a Lewis
bodyguard who tried to intercede.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis responded with an overhand right to the back of Tyson's head
and the melee was on. According to Lewis, somewhere at the bottom of
a pile of bodyguards, security people, boxing officials and
publicists, Tyson bit through Lewis' pants and into the fighter's
thigh.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Sulaiman, head of the World Boxing Council, suffered a mild
concussion when he fell and banged the back of his head. Gary Shaw,
Lewis' promoter, briefly lost consciousness after getting hit several
times.</TE>
<TE>   When calm was somewhat restored, Tyson spewed a string of epithets
at a reporter in the crowd who had the nerve to suggest the fighter
might be better off in a straitjacket. One television station, airing
a 29-second sound byte, had to use 16 expletive-masking bleeps.</TE>
<TE>   Been there. Done that.</TE>
<TE>   Remember Tyson biting both of Evander Holyfield's ears, indeed
chewing off a piece of one ear, in their heavyweight rematch?</TE>
<TE>   Tyson has been spewing expletives in public since he became a
public figure. He once began a news conference by referring to the
gathered media as "perverts, pedophiles, freaks and deadbeat dads."</TE>
<TE>   And that's the cleaned-up version.</TE>
<TE>   He has threatened to eat Lewis' children.</TE>
<TE>   But why should Tyson cool his act when he receives such
reinforcement from the man in the street?</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's going to win the fight," one excited bystander
yelled into a cell phone as he hovered near Tyson on Tuesday. "He
didn't seem at all afraid of Lewis."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody has ever, or will ever, confuse Tyson with Cal Ripken. Yet
watching Tyson parade around 44th Street, receiving pats on the back
and requests for autographs, was like watching a bizarre, twisted
version of Ripken's victory trot around Camden Yards after breaking
the consecutive games record.</TE>
<TE>   How sad.</TE>
<TE>   It is from the streets of this city that Tyson rose, deprived,
bitter and determined to battle his way out of the ghetto. It is here
that he operated as a bully and small-time thug.</TE>
<TE>   And as proven Tuesday, it is here that he can still receive
approval now that he is a big-time thug.</TE>
<TE>   So why change?</TE>
<TE>   But it's not just the crowd on the street that is to blame for
Tyson's ongoing rampage. Many elements of society, knowing full well
this is an emotionally ill individual who requires medication just to
get through the day, continue to look the other way.</TE>
<TE>   How sick is the restaurant owner in Cincinnati who has a piece of
Holyfield's ear on his wall as a souvenir? Is he now going to bid for
the chunk of Lewis' thigh?</TE>
<TE>   Tyson is weaned off his medication before each fight, thus
becoming a raging lunatic, merely for our collective amusement.</TE>
<TE>   If a lion or a tiger in a zoo were treated that way, there would
be a huge howl of protest. But, of course, a lion or tiger cannot
generate $100 million from their act.</TE>
<TE>   Why would the Nevada State Athletic Commission, in good
conscience, give this man a boxing license at his hearing Tuesday,
ruling that it believes he can control himself in the ring?</TE>
<TE>   One hundred million dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Why would officials of Las Vegas' MGM Grand Hotel agree to welcome
Tyson and the posse of troublemakers he attracts when an earlier
Tyson-Holyfield fight ended with a riot in the MGM casino, resulting
in injuries and mayhem?</TE>
<TE>   One hundred million dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the fight isn't sanctioned by the athletic commission,
Sulaiman said the rematch had the approval of the WBC.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Lewis himself will have more sense than any of them. He
has said he will evaluate his options after the commission rules.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis stands to make at least $20 million. He knows he should be
able to easily beat a fighter whose skills have long since deserted
him.</TE>
<TE>   But he also knows that Tyson, facing sure defeat and more
humiliation, is liable to resort to some outrageous exit, to perhaps
again bare his teeth and search for a body part.</TE>
<TE>   And all that will stand between Tyson and Lewis is a referee half
their size.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis may ask himself, who needs this?</TE>
<TE>   It is a question we all should have been asking ourselves about
Mike Tyson a long time ago.</TE>

<LD>Elvis Stojko is a national treasure in Canada, the skater who landed
the world's first monster quadruple-triple in 1997. Last week he
returned to the rink where he first accomplished the feat and did it
again.</LD>
<LD>   Said Steve Milton in the Hamilton Spectator: "The height, form,
landing and recovery came right out of the textbook that he wrote
when he landed the world's first quad-triple."</LD>
<LD>   It was the first time Stojko had landed one successfully since
winning the 1997 World Championship. It also climaxed the seven-time
Canadian champion's comeback he hopes will lead to a gold medal in
the Salt Lake Olympics--at which time he will retire.</LD>
<TE>   "I wasn't just fighting to be the best, I was fighting against a
lot of people who were against me," he said. "Not so much the fans,
but the critics and the people inside the sport. It's emotional. This
is exactly the way I wanted to say goodbye."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who has won the most Australian Open tennis
tournaments?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Neon Deion: St. Louis Ram cornerback Aeneas Williams intercepted
two Brett Favre passes for touchdowns last week, but the Green Bay
Packer quarterback wouldn't say Williams was the best corner he has
faced.</TE>
<TE>   "He's one of the best, [but] I wouldn't say he is the best," Favre
told Don Pierson of the Chicago Tribune. "Deion Sanders was pretty
good. At least I'll throw at Aeneas. If I can help it, I wouldn't
throw it at Deion."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Did he get a raise? Joab Lesesne was an assistant football coach
at Wofford last season. He was also president of the Spartanburg,
S.C., university from 1972 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Premature perhaps: Gary Sheffield, in USA Today Baseball Weekly:
"This [Atlanta] is where I want to be. I want to go into the Hall of
Fame as a Brave."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unhappy camper: The bowl championship series had college football
fans in a dither around New Year's Day, but concerns about Oregon or
Nebraska had nothing on John Shafer, the athletic director at
Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   Ole Miss had a 7-4 record and sat home, while 6-5 Alabama--a 27-24
loser to Mississippi--was in the Independence Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't watch any bowl games, I boycotted them," Shafer told the
Memphis Commercial Appeal. "I was in a snit. All I did was come to my
office in the morning and answer e-mail from fans who were killing me
for not getting us in a bowl."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Balance: In Charlotte's 111-101 win Wednesday night over the
Seattle SuperSonics, each Hornet starter scored in double figures.
David Wesley had 21, Baron Davis 20, Lee Nailon 19, Elden Campbell 17
and P.J. Brown 14.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Margaret Smith Court, 11. Roy Emerson, with six,
has the most men's titles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Larry Lucchino is one of the new Boston Red Sox
owners. Speaking at the Boston baseball writers' annual dinner, he
said:</TE>
<TE>   "I come from San Diego, where if they had a baseball writers
dinner in the middle of the winter, it would be in a drive-through
restaurant with 4 1/2 people."</TE>
<TE>   P.S. Wonder if Lucchino knows that the new Baseball Writers' Assn.
of America president is Bill Center--from the San Diego
Union-Tribune.</TE>

<HD>Demanding Hitchcock Fired</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Coach led Stars to Stanley Cup championship but
couldn't get along with players. General Manager Gainey becomes
consultant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>IRVING, Texas</DL>
<LD>Ken Hitchcock, whose sandpaper-like personality pushed the Dallas
Stars to a Stanley Cup title, finally pushed himself out of a job. He
was fired Friday and, at the same time, General Manager Bob Gainey
announced he was reducing his role to consultant.</LD>
<LD>   In one swoop the coach and the architect of the team that was a
model for consistency were ousted. Assistant coach Rick Wilson was
named interim coach and Doug Armstrong will take over as general
manager.</LD>
<LD>   The Stars won five consecutive division titles, appeared in two
Stanley Cup finals and won the championship in 1998-99 under
Hitchcock. But they have labored this season and are seventh in the
Western Conference. They trail Pacific Division-leading San Jose by
four points and are one point ahead of the charging Kings.</LD>
<TE>   Hitchcock's relationship with his players, which has been strained
during the good times, had deteriorated as things went bad on the
ice.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't something that arrived in a flash," Gainey said. "It has
been the ongoing sputtering and stalling of our team. Everybody
connected to the group has some responsibility. Ken is paying a price
today."</TE>
<TE>   Gainey may be paying, as well. He had planned to step down and
assume a consultant role after the season. The accelerated timetable
may have had more to do with failed off-season moves, which were
supposed to return the Stars to the top after they were swept in the
second round of last season's playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Gainey went on a shopping spree last summer, spending $16 million
on free agents. He allowed Brett Hull to leave as a free agent and
signed Pierre Turgeon and Donald Audette to fill that offensive void.</TE>
<TE>   Hull, who signed with Detroit, is having another solid season with
18 goals. Turgeon, who has struggled because of injuries, has seven
goals and Audette had four in 20 games before being traded to
Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   "Ken and I have been attached and partners for quite a while,"
Gainey said. "I did feel it was my choice to bring him back and
support him through some difficult times in the past year or 18
months. It should be my responsibility to address that situation
myself."</TE>
<TE>   The situation grew worse Thursday. After practice, Hitchcock had
an intense conversation with center Mike Modano, who was tired of
Hitchcock's philosophy of defense first, last and always.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a bit of a surprise," said Modano, who tried to downplay
Thursday's clash with Hitchcock. "We have to realize we have jobs to
do. We weren't responding to anything as players."</TE>
<TE>   But tension between players and Hitchcock had increased. He drove
his players hard, with team captain Derian Hatcher often being the
buffer, conveying complaints from player to coach.</TE>
<TE>   "This will definitely shake things up," Hatcher said. "Do I think
it was the right move? I don't know. I do feel bad for Hitch. ... He
had the same message from Day 1. Maybe guys had heard it over and
over again and it got to be a little too much."</TE>
<TE>   Even Hatcher publicly complained about the team's performance
after a 4-2 loss to Vancouver on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "What I said was the players had to start caring more," Hatcher
said. "That's all. Nothing has changed. It is up to us as players to
get this done."</TE>
<TE>   Gainey joined the organization as coach in 1990, when the team was
the Minnesota North Stars, and took the team to the 1991 Stanley Cup
final. He took on the general manager duties in 1993. He oversaw the
move to Texas and hired Hitchcock as coach with 43 games left in the
1995-96 season.</TE>
<TE>   Hitchcock was 277-160-60-6 with the Stars and had a 47-33 record
in the playoffs. His passion for defense helped make the Stars
winners, but his personality didn't win over many players. Hull was
signed as a free agent to bolster the offense in 1998-99 but feuded
with Hitchcock at times during his three years in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   The Stars defeated the Buffalo Sabres in a six-game Stanley Cup
final in 1999.</TE>

<HD>Anaheim Makes Dallas Pay in 6-1 Win</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>All the good news belonged to the Mighty Ducks on Friday, a novelty
that they basked in. Call it a moment in the sun.</LD>
<LD>   Their 6-1 victory over the Dallas Stars had to leave the 18,532 at
the American Airlines Center wondering just which team has been
wallowing this season.</LD>
<LD>   Matt Cullen had two goals and an assist. Oleg Tverdovsky had three
assists. Goalie Jean-Sebastian Giguere had a week's worth of Duck
offense to play with and stopped 20 of 21 shots. The Ducks scored
three power-play goals. All of which handed Coach Bryan Murray his
500th victory.</LD>
<TE>   "When we get the breaks and play well like that, the sun is
shining all the time," Cullen said. "It's been raining all year."</TE>
<TE>   The Stars found themselves in the odd role of needing to borrow
the Ducks' umbrella.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Star management fired Coach Ken Hitchcock, who
wasn't on many of his players' Christmas card lists. So the players
seemed to get what they wanted and proceeded to play in a fashion
that appeared to indicate the problem wasn't the coach.</TE>
<TE>   The Stars have turned dull and methodical into five consecutive
division championships and the 1999 Stanley Cup. Let loose from
Hitchcock's reign, their play had a Three Stooges' appearance.</TE>
<TE>   An Anaheim onslaught on offense began with a trickle and became a
downpour. German Titov poked a rebound through goalie Ed Belfour's
leg and it slowly slid across the line for a 1-0 lead 5 minutes 58
seconds into the first period. Within four minutes the Ducks had a
3-0 advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Cullen tucked in a backhander. Paul Kariya then picked up a
blocked shot and chipped home a power-play goal. The Ducks had more
goals than the Stars had shots until the final 40 seconds of the
period and finished with a 14-4 edge.</TE>
<TE>   "We played hockey," Tverdovsky said. "That was different from what
has been happening this year. We have created chances all year, but
we seem to panic at the end. Our forwards showed poise tonight. They
were patient."</TE>
<TE>   More so than the Stars, who seemed to crumble after the first
goal.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Leclerc knocked down Jere Lehtinen in the corner, then skated
to the net, where he was left alone on a power play. Tverdovsky found
him, and Leclerc had time to switch forehand to backhand three times
before beating Belfour for a 4-0 lead six minutes into the second
period.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never seen a Dallas team play like that," Leclerc said. "I
liked it. Keep it up."</TE>
<TE>   Marc Chouinard turned a turnover into a goal a minute later and
Belfour was pulled.</TE>
<TE>   Murray had empathy for Hitchcock.</TE>
<TE>   "Kenny Hitchcock has done almost as much as any coach can do in an
organization, as far as I can see," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning the Stanley Cup, the team is always at top of the heap.
He's been demanding I guess. But if you're going to coach in this
league and you're not demanding, you're not going to last long."</TE>

<HD>Lakers Cash One In at the Bank</HD>
<DH>Rookie Parker Sharpens Spurs From the Point</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Welcome back, Spurs.</LD>
<LD>   Last spring's Western finalists met again Friday night and, for
the sixth time in a row, counting playoffs, the Lakers won, 94-91,
but this one was nothing like the preceding five, which the Spurs had
lost by an average of 21 points.</LD>
<LD>   Also and not coincidentally, this one included Tony Parker, the
Spur from Paris, 19 years old and just back from the injured list,
who galvanized his teammates, coming off the bench to score 14 points
in 27 minutes and turning what looked like another budding rout into
a tie game going down the stretch.</LD>
<TE>   It was Lakers 93, Spurs 91, when Parker tried to tie it again,
forcing a 15-foot turnaround and barely grazing the rim. The Lakers
rebounded, Shaquille O'Neal was fouled, made one of two, Terry Porter
missed a three at the buzzer and that was that.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he [Parker] played great," said Coach Gregg Popovich
afterward. "He's a young kid, he hadn't played in two, three weeks,
whatever, but he's got a fire in his belly. He's a hell of a
competitor.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to keep improving so we can hopefully play these guys
[Lakers] at the end of the year."</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs came into the game off Thursday night's win over the
Jazz in Salt Lake City, but even that wasn't without blemish. The
Spurs failed to get a single offensive rebound which, they later
learned, was an NBA low.</TE>
<TE>   Said Porter before Friday's game, laughing: "We're making some
history we don't want. Too much history."</TE>
<TE>   Some history you're stuck with. Before the game, Popovich said he
was thinking of breaking one of his rules, and starting Parker, who
had missed five games with a badly sprained ankle and had yet to
practice with the team.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thinking long-term," Popovich said. "At this point, he needs
to play in every NBA game he can and the fact it's the Lakers is
good. Let him get used to playing against them."</TE>
<TE>   These teams have been trading humiliations for years, the Spurs
sweeping the Lakers in the '99 playoffs, before the Lakers got the
Spurs last spring. With two seven-footers, the Spurs are unique; they
can defend O'Neal within the rules.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, no matter how the Lakers may deny it, they're
always looking out for the Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a team that has the ability to double-team [O'Neal] with
bigs," said Phil Jackson before the game, "come across and block
shots with the other big guy when Shaquille gets in the lane, so
they're actually very good, within the spirit of the rules.</TE>
<TE>   "And now that there's zone availabilities for this team, they can
do a lot more with what they have. Like the Clippers a lot of times
the other night had two guys on Shaquille. They didn't even bother to
play our power forward."</TE>
<TE>   The problem for the Spurs is one of their "bigs," David Robinson,
has been left out of the offense for so long, he barely has any
offensive game left. On defense, when the Spurs play the Lakers, he
has to line up on O'Neal and that isn't fair either. David is 36 and
weighs 250. Shaq is 29 and weighs as much as Mike Tyson and Oscar De
La Hoya combined.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, when the Lakers won in San Antonio, Popovich complained
later that "a couple of our guys" didn't show. As San Antonio
Express-News columnist noted, Popovich was actually referring to his
"7-1 couple of people."</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't the end of it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not trying to single Five-O [Robinson] out but he's the guy,"
said Porter. "This has always been--no matter the situation--the Twin
Towers and their supporting cast. We just have to get him comfortable
again or confident."</TE>
<TE>   As he has been recently, Robinson was more active Friday--12
rebounds worth--but no more successful, with O'Neal going for 18 on
him in the first half, making nine of 12 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Parker's first few minutes were tentative and his first few shots
were wild, but he began to settle in in the second half and the Spurs
kept edging closer.</TE>
<TE>   It had been a long time since the Spurs were in a game against the
Lakers in the fourth quarter, so for them, at least, it was progress.
It may not be enough, but for the moment, they'll take it.</TE>

<HD>A New Bet: You Make the Call</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Two companies begin handling Internet and
phone wagers in California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While the California Horse Racing Board met  Thursday, one of the
commissioners, John Harris, was wondering how one of his many horses
did in the second race at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   During a break in the meeting, Harris learned that Green Team, his
3-year-old gelding, had found room on the rail to win at 20-1. Green
Team, the longest shot on the board, paid $42.60 for $2, but Harris
didn't have a bet down.</LD>
<LD>   "Too bad," he said. "We should have approved those licenses
earlier. Then I could have phoned in something."</LD>
<TE>   What the racing board did by midafternoon was issue licenses to
two companies--XpressBet,  which is owned by Magna Entertainment, the
corporation that owns Santa Anita; and the Television Games Network,
a subsidiary of the company that publishes TV Guide--that will be at
the forefront of telephone and Internet horse betting in California.
They quickly swung into business, the Television Games Network (TVG)
opening accounts Friday for Californians who want to bet quarter
horses at Los Alamitos and 11 other tracks, and XpressBet launching
today  with a menu of 40 tracks, including Santa Anita, Golden Gate
Fields and Gulfstream Park, which are all Magna properties.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been very busy with new accounts," said Carmelita, one of
the TVG operators at its Oregon betting hub. "About 90% of the new
business is coming from California."</TE>
<TE>   In less than 10 minutes Friday, Carmelita signed up a reporter for
a betting account, which he used later in the day to place a few bets
at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans and for the night card at Los
Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Wilson, president of TVG, said that it was not possible to
quantify how many new accounts had been added Friday. TVG has been in
business since 1999 in other states, where it has thousands of
betting accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not sure this is going to be a positive or a negative,"
said Rick Henson, president of Los Alamitos Race Course. "If getting
the races on TV develops new fans, then it will help. It should also
curb some of the offshore betting that's been going on, betting that
doesn't help us at all. But we're all going into uncharted waters.</TE>
<TE>   "The phone and the Internet should bring us closer to our patrons.
It's not a short-term fix and it will be a while before we know how
much it's helping. But if we find that all we're really doing is
moving the bettor from the grandstand to the couch, then we've made
the wrong move. What we'd like to do is convert our casual fan. If we
can move him up a notch, from a casual to a frequent racegoer, then
we will have done some good."</TE>
<TE>   The reporter--no whiz at keypads and Web-surfing--had no trouble
signing up, although one of the security questions made him think. He
knew what high school he attended and the town where he was born, but
then Carmelita asked: "What was the name of your first car?" He
resisted saying it was a Tin Lizzie or a Stutz Bearcat, feeling that
she wouldn't understand the humor.</TE>
<TE>   A bettor is allowed to use a credit card and a debit card once
each per day to increase his account balance, with a $1,000 limit per
card per month. Later, the reporter was told,  a subscriber kit that
includes a form  enabling him to increase that limit would be
provided.</TE>
<TE>   A little later, he dialed in to place a couple of bets at the Fair
Grounds. He learned by punching in the right numbers that one of the
horses he liked in a three-horse exacta box had been scratched.
Settling on a two-horse box and an across-the-board bet on one of the
horses, the best he could do was a second-place finish as a longshot
won the race. Net for the race: a loss of  $11.</TE>
<TE>   Then he turned his attention to Friday night's card at Los
Alamitos. He bet the first race, but the system rejected his bet for
the second. That's because the second race was for Arabians.</TE>
<TE>   "That's an oversight," Henson said later. "Apparently you can't
bet Arabians in Maryland, which is one of the states where TVG does
business. But they'll get it straightened out. You'll eventually be
able to bet every race we run."</TE>
<TE>   The drawback for Californians is that TVG and Magna, after failing
to agree on a partnership, are forcing horseplayers to maintain
separate accounts if they plan to bet all the tracks here. TVG has
contracts with Hollywood Park, Del Mar, Los Alamitos and for the Oak
Tree meet at Santa Anita. But it can't offer the three Magna tracks
in California.</TE>
<TE>   At least it will be getting easier in certain areas to receive
TVG's telecasts of live races. Already in about 700,000 homes in
California, TVG recently signed a contract with Adelphia
Communications, whose digital cable service will make the races
available in Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Hermosa Beach and Beverly
Hills, as well as other areas. It is estimated that this deal will
increase TVG's coverage by about 100,000 homes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is only the beginning," Wilson said. "But it's an important
step toward raising interest and awareness of horse racing in
California."</TE>

<HD>Fans' Reception Still Is Difficult for Blake</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former King Rob Blake and the Colorado Avalanche will make their
first appearance of the season today at Staples Center--and Blake
still hasn't forgotten the nasty reception that greeted him here
during the playoffs last May.</LD>
<LD>   The all-star defenseman blames the Kings for the boos that rained
down on him, believing management portrayed him unfairly in contract
negotiations that eventually broke down, leading to his trade to the
Avalanche last February.</LD>
<LD>   "They had their agenda," Blake told the Denver Post last month.
"They told me on Day 1 of training camp, 'If you want anything over
$7 million, we're going to trade you.' Management said I'm greedy,
that I wanted this, I wanted that. But, I mean, they offered me $20
million less than what I got [in a multiyear deal from the
Avalanche]. I mean, does anyone in the world really take that much
less?</LD>
<TE>   "Ask any of those fans that booed me and every one of them would
do the same thing I did. But management wants to paint a picture of
me as being greedy, and the fans are going to eat that up."</TE>
<TE>   King General Manager Dave Taylor on Friday called Blake's comments
"inaccurate" and said the club had done nothing to portray Blake
badly.</TE>
<TE>   "We made what we felt was a fair offer, and it wasn't good
enough," said Taylor, adding that it was "considerably more" than $7
million a year. "He had the ability to be an unrestricted free agent
and made it clear that he was going to exercise that option, so it
wasn't much choice for us. We had to make a deal, and we're happy
with the deal [that brought Adam Deadmarsh and Aaron Miller to the
Kings]."</TE>
<TE>   Blake, second in scoring among NHL defensemen with 36 points, is
making $9.4 million this season in the first year of a five-year,

<HD>Lakers Cash One In at the Bank</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Fox makes the key shot and L.A. beats San
Antonio for the second time in six days, 94-91, to halt two-game
losing streak.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pressed by a destiny they believe is still five months away, hounded
by a regular season that sometimes looks smaller than the tiniest
diamond on their last championship ring, the Lakers won on Friday
night, which wouldn't seem like that big a deal, but it was.</LD>
<LD>   They finished a fight started by the San Antonio Spurs. They
finished it with a Rick Fox bank shot, with a Derek Fisher defensive
stand, and with a 94-91 victory at Staples Center, for their first
win in three games.</LD>
<LD>   Kobe Bryant scored 27 points and Shaquille O'Neal had 25 points
and 15 rebounds, and Tim Duncan scored 24 points, 18 after halftime.</LD>
<TE>   It was not quite end to end, not quite seamless, but the Lakers
were closer to relentless, closer to polished. So, they'll leave Los
Angeles this morning, bound for Philadelphia and a weeklong trip with
a game nearly resembling what they expect of themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Excellent win," O'Neal said as he strolled from the arena, a
large gold lawman's badge hanging from his belt. "The team played
well. I'm proud of us.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we need to be a little more consistent. Now we have to get up
for everybody the same way."</TE>
<TE>   Leave it to the Spurs to bring out something gritty in the Lakers,
who were decidedly not gritty for the better part of a week that
started with Staples Center losses to Denver and the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   Fox made his shot from the right side of the lane for a 93-91 lead
with 1:09 left and then he stole the ball from Steve Smith on the
next possession. Fisher, replaced by Lindsey Hunter in the starting
lineup, missed a three-point attempt, but then forced a miss by Spur
rookie Tony Parker on the other end. O'Neal made the second of two
free throws with six seconds left and the game ended when Terry
Porter was a foot short on a three-point attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Horry, who guarded Duncan for most of the second half--he
played 29 minutes to starter Samaki Walker's 15--took the rebound and
flung the ball down the floor, so pleased to have it over. The Spurs
had a little more to them this time, six days after getting blown out
in San Antonio, but it ended the same way, with a sixth consecutive
loss to the Lakers, including last season's Western Conference finals
debacle.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan followed a Robinson miss with a rebound and a layup with a
little more than four minutes remaining, and the Spurs were tied,
84-84. It was the end of some big Laker leads, nine in the first
quarter, 13 in the second quarter and 12 in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher, asked about the lineup change, said, "No comment."</TE>
<TE>   With five losses in seven games and a five-game road trip ahead,
the Lakers, who haven't lost three in a row under Phil Jackson, came
looking for rhythm to their game, some momentum, maybe something to
drive them from a dreary six weeks of basketball. Bryant said he
hoped the Lakers found a rhythm to their season.</TE>
<TE>   "You get into a groove," he said. "This season, that's one of the
things we haven't had, because the season's been so choppy."</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs had lost two of three and four of seven, including one
by 17 points to the Lakers last Saturday, a game the Lakers played
without O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a strange time in basketball," Jackson had said. "I'm
seeing a lot of front-running teams have trouble winning."</TE>
<TE>   He mentioned the Spurs, who have played around .500 for a month,
along with the Lakers, among others.</TE>
<TE>   "Minnesota, after being touted by USA Today this week as the top
team in the NBA is just getting their butts kicked by a couple
teams," he said. "It's just parity about basketball. It's a long,
long, long schedule. You just have to go through a schedule. The
attrition of it sometimes catches up to you. You have to play the way
you should play on your home court. That's the key.</TE>
<TE>   "Some nights are going to be difficult on the road. But, on your
home court, you really have to make things happen for you."</TE>
<TE>   Duncan had three shots blocked in the first quarter, two by former
sparring partner Walker. The third--on a dunk attempt with half a
minute left--by Bryant, caused tantrums by Duncan and Coach Gregg
Popovich, followed by technical fouls, followed by two free throws by
Bryant and a 28-19 lead.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal did his usual number on David Robinson, and the beatings
are becoming more severe as Robinson ages. O'Neal made nine of his
first 11 shots, on spins and pull-ups and jump hooks. Once, early in
the second quarter, he finished with a left-handed dunk and then held
up that hand all the way to the defensive end, just in case anyone
missed it.</TE>
<TE>   By halftime, O'Neal had 18 points and nine rebounds. Duncan, who
missed nine of 12 attempts in the first half, did not play for nine
minutes in the second quarter, during which the Spurs went from 13
points back to one back to 12 back.</TE>

<LD>Something wonderful occurred in pro football last weekend. A replay
official decided to review a play that no one on Earth felt needed
review.</LD>
<LD>   Not Tom Brady to be sure, not the Patriot coach, none of his
players and none of the 70,000 fans in snowy Foxboro stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Anyhow, the rule eventually was interpreted to read that a fake
forward pass is indeed a real pass if the quarterback drops the ball
while his hand is moving forward. (Let's try to forget that the
official who decided that Brady's hand was indeed still moving
forward is the same guy who insists that a microscopic bug who flies
into a freight train moving at 70 mph somehow impedes the forward
motion of that train. Hey! That's the rule.)</LD>
<TE>   Strange and magnificent as that may be, it is not the most amazing
aspect of this entire scenario. What blows my mind is that all this
controversy prompted Bill Plaschke to write an article I agree with.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Jensen</TE>

<TE>   I have been a Raider fan for the better part of 25 years, watching
them go from Oakland to L.A. and back to Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   I have witnessed Al Davis make a hero and then a fool of himself
many times over. I have come to understand why many people despise Al
and all the Raider posturing that goes along with him. I have always
poked fun at the loyal Raider conspiracy theorists who would have you
believe that the NFL is out to get them.</TE>
<TE>   Last Saturday night, I quit making fun. Not only does the NFL have
it in for the Raiders, it is unabashedly proud of that fact.</TE>

<TE>   The Oakland Raiders were dealt a great injustice by the NFL's
"tuck rule" last Saturday. It is obvious to anyone who understands
football and viewed the TV replays--except for the referee, of
course--that, at the time he was hit by Charles Woodson, the
Patriots' quarterback was trying to tuck, not pass.</TE>
<TE>   A football generation ago, the Raiders suffered the misfortune of
"the Immaculate Reception." This current bunch of Raiders has now
been victimized by a judgment that will live in football infamy.</TE>

<LD>To those who feel the Dodgers trading Gary Sheffield was the
stupidest trade in team history, do I have to remind you this is the
same team under the same owner who once traded Mike Piazza? That was
the stupidest trade in team history, not this one.</LD>
<LD>   Remember, none of this would have happened had Chase Carey let
Fred Claire do his job, because had Claire been allowed to do his
job, he never would have traded Piazza for Sheffield. Bottom line
here is, they got rid of a great player who didn't want to be here.</LD>

<TE>   I would rather finish in last place with Brian Jordan in left
field than win the World Series with Gary Sheffield in left field. I
don't care how much offense we just lost; Jordan is a class act while
Sheffield is an egotistical buffoon.</TE>
<TE>   Good riddance, Gary.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Ramsey</TE>

<TE>   One of the ways the Dodger management could regain the health of
the team was to rid themselves of diseased players. Gary Sheffield
certainly was one of the walking tumors in the clubhouse. I chuckle
at the people who have criticized the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Freeman's letter of Jan. 19, in reference to Sheffield, "He
[GM Dan Evans] could trade the best right-handed hitter in the game
..." is laughable.</TE>
<TE>   When did Sheffield become a better hitter than (in no particular
order):</TE>

<TE>   My question to the Lakers is, since they seem to treat the first

<TE>   Memo to Phil Jackson: You might want to have the best player on
the planet actually play the fourth quarter in its entirety. I know
that the Zen master has his reasons; heck, old Phil may want to get
the towel boy some playing time. But sitting Kobe Bryant for half of
the fourth quarter is a sure way to lose games.</TE>

<TE>   Fear not, Laker fans. Phil Jackson has it all under control. As
soon as the team finishes the first half of the season with the
third- or fourth-best record in the conference, thus enabling him to
skip the All-Star game in Philadelphia so he can hang out in Palm
Springs with the owner's daughter, he will come back a new man and
guide the team to the best record in the league and a third
consecutive title.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Lansen</TE>
<TE>   Norwalk</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It seems to me things are just a little bit too cozy on the Laker
team at this point of the season and look where it's gotten us:
Losing to the worst teams in the NBA and to the cross-town rival
Clippers. This Shaq and Kobe lovefest is just not working. So in the
interest of lighting a fire under this seemingly complacent Laker
team I'm going to let Shaq in on a little secret: Kobe told me your
mother wears army boots!</TE>
<TE>   Jon Roe</TE>

<TE>   Before Shaquille O'Neal throws another punch in anger, he might
want to have a conversation with Rudy Tomjanovich, or better yet,
with Kermit Washington. A single, fateful punch and one man comes
away with a shattered face, the other with a shattered life.</TE>
<TE>   Bink Goncharoff</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Now that Shaq has pointed out that Bill Plaschke is a frog, does
this mean T.J. Simers will start referring to him as "Kermit" in his
column? And, by bashing Shaq, will this affect Plaschke's "homer"
status?</TE>

<HD>Time for Chick to Hang It Up?</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Laker game is on and I'm sitting on my couch reading because it's
a blowout. I am brought back to attention when I hear: "Worthy steals
the ball! Worthy dribbles up the floor!" Play-by-play from Laker
broadcaster, the marvelous Chick Hearn. The only problem? It was last
year.</LD>
<LD>   A basketball player hangs up his shoes and calls it a career when
his legs just will not carry him up the court any longer. So when
should an announcer? Yes, it's a painful question, but one that is
timely for discussion. Indeed Chick Hearn has given the Lakers years
of wonderful service. The best at his position to be sure.</LD>
<LD>   But any fan who listens on a consistent basis can recount the
mistakes that have slipped out of his mouth practically every night
for the last few years. Add to that the cantankerous tone that
befalls him any time the Lakers happen to be slouching and what you
have is reason to turn down the sound.</LD>
<TE>   But am I entirely alone on this position? Do we really need
another Harry Caray who everyone ends up making fun of?</TE>
<TE>   The timing is perfect for the Golden Throat to call it a career.
Let the Lakers hang the vocal cords in the rafters along with the
other jerseys, and let the torch be passed to the very adept Paul
Sunderland; just as Magic handed off to a young Nick Van Exel once
upon a time.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Diane Pucin's article on UCLA's inconsistency sums up life as a Bruin
basketball fan. I'd rather root for a team that has a strong sense of
self and loses than one where you feel it's like watching a pickup
game each time. Westwood is waiting patiently to wish Steve Lavin
well with his exciting, new announcing career.</LD>
<LD>   David Bloome</LD>

<TE>   Steve Lavin's energetic courtside fervor reminds me of one of John
Wooden's favorite maxims. "Do not mistake activity for achievement."</TE>
<TE>   Carl Wada</TE>
<TE>   Torrance</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If Steve Lavin was more concerned with teaching fundamentals to
his UCLA basketball team rather than making fashion statements then
maybe the Bruins would not continually suffer from the Lavin Curse of
panicking and blowing big leads in games.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Allen</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Palisades</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA fans are mad at Steve Lavin, but he was only keeping his eyes
on the prize. Lavin is not as dumb as you think. He realized that, in
order to get eight-year rollovers at UCLA, your teams have to quit
mid-game or mid-season, a la Bob Toledo's teams.</TE>

<LD>The Minnesota Supreme Court gave the operator of the Metrodome until
Thursday to respond to the request by the Twins and baseball to have
the high court review the injunction that forces the team to play
this season.</LD>
<LD>   Ordinarily, the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, the
team's landlord, would have had until Feb. 12 to respond. The Twins
and baseball filed the petition Wednesday, one day after the
Minnesota Court of Appeals voted 3-0 to uphold the injunction.</LD>
<LD>   The Supreme Court has not decided whether to accept the case, or
whether to grant the request by the Twins and baseball to set an
expedited schedule for oral arguments.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A fluke goal by Chicago defenseman Jon Klemm was the difference as
the Blackhawks snapped St. Louis' franchise-record 10-game winning
streak.</LD>
<LD>   Jocelyn Thibault made 25 saves as Chicago defeated St. Louis, 2-1,
Friday night at Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   Peter White's breakaway goal midway through the second period
stood up as the game-winner for Chicago, 11-3-1 in its last 15 games.</LD>
<TE>   "Tonight was as tough a hockey game as we've played in," said
Blackhawk Coach Brian Sutter, whose team moved four points ahead of
the Blues in the Central Division. "We got a lucky bounce tonight."</TE>
<TE>   As he crossed the red line, Klemm lofted a dump-in toward the
corner of the zone. St. Louis defenseman Chris Pronger deflected the
puck with a high stick and it slid past goalie Brent Johnson to open
the scoring with 4:49 left in the first for a 1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't even aiming the puck at the net," Klemm said. "I was
dumping the puck to the other side. For some reason Pronger put his
stick up above his shoulder and it caught Johnson off guard."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson had 25 saves and saw his 10-game winning streak end.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a bad goal to give up, but it counts," Johnson said. "By
the time I looked, it was just coming down over my pad and dropped
down behind me.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, we can get another streak going; they come to an end
like that. Chicago played well in their own barn."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo 4, Tampa Bay 1--Taylor Pyatt scored twice and Martin Biron
made 21 saves to lead the Sabres to a victory over the Lightning at
Buffalo, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Pyatt got the first multi-goal game of his two-year career. Curtis
Brown and Maximum Afinogenov also scored for Buffalo and Tim Connolly
had two assists.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay, midway through a four-game trip, has lost three of
four.</TE>
<TE>   Lightning goalie Nikolai Khabibulin, who began the game with the
NHL's best save percentage, stopped 29 of 33 shots.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 1, Florida 1--Ron Francis scored the 503rd goal of his
career in the second period at Raleigh, N.C., as the Hurricanes tied
the Panthers in their NHL-leading 19th overtime game.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina, 5-5-9 in overtime, outshot the Panthers, 40-21, in
regulation, but couldn't solve goalie Roberto Luongo.</TE>
<TE>   Sandis Ozolinsh's goal was the fastest against the Hurricanes this
season as he burned his former team on his first shift 25 seconds
into the game. It was his first goal in six games since being traded
from the Hurricanes to the Panthers on Jan. 16.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 4, Phoenix 1--Steve Yzerman moved into a tie for seventh
place on the all-time goal scoring list and also had an assist as the
Red Wings won at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Yzerman's goal, his 13th of the season, came with 48 seconds left
in the first period, breaking a 1-1 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Yzerman's goal tied him with Mark Messier of the New York Rangers
on the career list. Both have 658 goals.</TE>
<TE>   Manny Legace, making only his 12th start of the season in goal,
picked up the victory for the Red Wings, who are 7-1-2 in their last
10 games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver 6, Toronto 1--Brendan Morrison scored twice and Todd
Bertuzzi and Brent Sopel each had a goal and an assist as the Canucks
won at Vancouver, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Jovanovksi and Trevor Letowski also scored for the Canucks, who
won their fourth consecutive and improved to .500 (24-24-4-1) for the
first time this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Phoenix Coyotes acquired left wing Brian Savage, a third-round
draft pick and future considerations from the Montreal Canadiens for
left wing Sergei Berezin.</TE>
<TE>   Savage had 14 goals and 15 assists in 47 games with Montreal this
season.</TE>
<TE>   In his only season with the Coyotes, Berezin had seven goals and
nine assists in 41 games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Also, the Coyotes acquired Andrei Nazarov from the Boston Bruins
for a fifth-round pick in the 2002 draft.</TE>
<TE>   Nazarov, 27, better known in Boston for his fists than his scoring
touch, had no goals and two assists with 145 penalty minutes in 47
games this season.</TE>

<HD>Scouts' Dishonor</HD>
<DH>Despite the Extensive Resources Committed to Evaluating
Prospects, the Quarterbacks Still in the Playoffs Fooled the
So-Called Experts</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There are your draftniks and your draftoids. There are your Ourlads'
Guides and your Mel Kiper Jrs. There are the combines and
40-yard-dash times and tests of arm strength and accuracy and
personality tests and tryouts and workouts.</LD>
<LD>   Lots of tryouts and workouts. Serious men, the scouts, with big
clipboards and little stopwatches, staring and writing and timing and
nodding knowingly and acting as if their little toys, their boards
and watches, scales and tape measures can predict who will be a good
NFL quarterback.</LD>
<LD>   But based on this year's final four group of quarterbacks, maybe
NFL teams should have the scouts dump the stopwatches, roll up the
tape measures and just look and listen.</LD>
<TE>   Maybe ESPN could dump Kiper. Maybe there's no sense in reading the
Ourlads' Guides and the dozens of other draft publications that are
already being quoted breathlessly about who will be the top
quarterbacks picked in the next draft. David Carr from Fresno State.
Joey Harrington from Oregon. It won't be a Kurt Warner.</TE>
<TE>   The story of Warner is legend. A benchwarmer at Northern Iowa. A
grocery stock boy. An Arena League player. A starter for the St.
Louis Rams only because Trent Green was injured in the exhibition
season. A two-time NFL MVP.</TE>
<TE>   Warner has taken the Rams to Sunday's NFC championship game. The
opponent, the Philadelphia Eagles, is led by quarterback Donovan
McNabb, whose name was booed and whose talent was demeaned all around
Philadelphia by "those in the know."</TE>
<TE>   In the AFC championship game are a couple more accidental
quarterbacks. Kordell Stewart of Pittsburgh has fought to not be a
wide receiver or a defensive back, has spent five years trying to
become "Slash," the multi-purpose player Coach Bill Cowher first made
him.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's Tom Brady, the starter for the New England
Patriots only because Drew Bledsoe got hurt in September. Brady, in
his second NFL season, was also an accidental starter at Michigan.
Brady was never deemed good enough to beat out Drew Henson. Henson
was a baseball player, is now a baseball player and will probably
always be a baseball player. Brady was a quarterback, is now a
quarterback, will probably always be a quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Tell that to the experts.</TE>
<TE>   Brady, 6 feet 5 and 220 pounds, doesn't have much use for the
experts. It was the experts who made him the 199th choice in the
draft two years ago. He was the 33rd pick. In the sixth round.</TE>
<TE>   So phooey to the experts. The experts at Michigan booed him early
because he wasn't Brian Griese and then booed him late because he
wasn't Henson. Griese took Michigan to a Big Ten title his senior
year. Brady didn't follow up with another. Henson was famous. The New
York Yankees wanted to draft Henson and finally did. The perfect
credentials for a Big Ten quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Brady doesn't have much use for anything except studying film,
listening to his coaches and keeping a baseball cap pulled low over
his forehead so that when he leaves his house, people don't know they
are at the grocery store with Tom Brady, Patriot quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   You'd think it would be possible to get a rise out of Brady this
week by expressing some doubt that the young quarterback who has been
second string most of his life won't be overwhelmed by all the
pressure he will find Sunday in the AFC championship game in
Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I don't think so," Brady says. "I think everything I've gone
through has prepared me pretty well."</TE>
<TE>   That's mostly all Brady will say about his fight to play at
Michigan and the tense times he has faced at New England since
Bledsoe returned but stayed demoted. Bledsoe, who was never
accidental and always the chosen one, has been unhappy with the loss
of his starting job. Brady stayed stoic.</TE>
<TE>   "From the first day I walked in at Michigan I was competing
against Brian Griese and then later in my career, with Drew Henson,"
Brady says. "You deal with competition. Competition is the same
whether it's for your job or for your team to win."</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots weren't expecting Brady to be 12-3 as a starter or
lead them to the AFC title game. Honestly, the Patriots weren't
expecting Brady to ever be a starter.</TE>
<TE>   Brady won 20 games as a starter at Michigan and lost only five.
Not bad. But he wasn't Henson. He wasn't Griese.</TE>
<TE>   He isn't Bledsoe. He is only a winner.</TE>
<TE>   As Brady stood up before the national media Friday, as he looked
the cameras straight on and answered the questions politely and
confidently, what you saw was a leader. Brady is only 24, practically
a rookie and certainly a novice in this most pressure-filled
occasion. But Brady takes command. Of a podium, of a football team,
of an NFL season.</TE>
<TE>   There is no stopwatch that can time a leader, no instrument that
can measure leadership.</TE>

11 assists with four turnovers as he led a 52-point second half in
the 81-70 victory. Irvine made 11 of 19 three-point baskets and shot

<LD>Santa Ana Mater Dei continued its dominance of Serra League opponents
with an impressive 67-59 victory Friday in front of a packed house of
2,250 at Santa Margarita.</LD>
<LD>   Harrison Schaen and Wesley Washington made two baskets each as
Mater Dei jumped out to an 8-0 lead two minutes into the game.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Margarita cut the deficit to four with 2:40 to play in the
first half, but a late run provided the Monarchs a 33-24 lead at
halftime.</LD>
<TE>   Mater Dei (19-4, 4-0), ranked fifth by The Times, has won 12
consecutive games and has beaten sixth-ranked Santa Margarita six
times in a row, including a 71-55 victory Jan. 11. The Monarchs have
not lost a league game since the 1997-98 season.</TE>
<TE>   Schaen, a 6-foot-9 junior, scored a season-high 22 points on
nine-of-13 shooting. He also had 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Strawberry added 16 points and seven rebounds, and Washington
finished with 14 points and six rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Rohe made six of eight from the field and finished with a
team-high 19 points for Santa Margarita (18-3, 2-2). Travis Smith had
13 points and six rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we played great from the start," Schaen said. "We were
focused mentally, we concentrated on our game and came to play. It
was one of our best games this year."</TE>

<TE>   Dorsey 86, Crenshaw 78--Spurred on by a noisy crowd, Dorsey
withstood a second-half comeback by visiting Crenshaw to remain
unbeaten in the Coliseum League.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Flourney led the Dons (14-5, 6-0 in league) with 27 points
and Donald Wilson had 23 points and 12 rebounds, including three
dunks in the final minute that sealed the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew playing at home we'd have the fans on our side and we fed
off that energy," Flourney said. "[Crenshaw doesn't] like coming here
because they feel suffocated."</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey, ranked 12th, never trailed and led, 45-30, at halftime,
but Crenshaw (15-6, 4-2) used a 10-0 run at the start of the third
quarter to get back in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Marcus Williams scored 22 of his 26 points in the second half,
including a steal and layup at the third-quarter buzzer that pulled
Crenshaw to within 56-55.</TE>
<TE>   "We played hard, we just had too big a deficit to overcome," said
Williams, who made five of seven three-point attempts and also had
seven assists and five steals. "We also gave them too many wide open
looks in the fourth quarter."</TE>
<TE>   Derick Clark finished with 21 points and Onyekachi Ibekwe added 14
for Crenshaw, ranked 14th. Flourney hit a three-pointer and Wilson
dunked to end a 14-3 run that gave Dorsey a 76-60 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Dons handed Crenshaw its first league loss on Jan. 9 and have
a two-game lead over the Cougars and Fremont.</TE>

<LD>They had been humiliated on their home floor, in front of their
friends, fans and family.</LD>
<LD>   No, the members of the Fairfax High boys' basketball team didn't
forget the 32-point loss they suffered earlier this month against
Westchester.</LD>
<LD>   They avenged it.</LD>
<TE>   Fairfax stunned the Comets, 66-62, in a Western League game Friday
at Westchester.</TE>
<TE>   Evan Burns scored 17 points for Fairfax (21-3, 7-1 in league
play), which led at halftime, 29-22, and never let Westchester
unleash its high-flying offense.</TE>
<TE>   Westchester (19-2, 7-1), ranked No. 3 in the nation by USA Today,
took a 50-48 lead on a putback by Keith Everage with 6:25 left, but
Alex Bausley's three-pointer gave Fairfax the lead for good.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Heath made three free throws with nine seconds left to
pull Westchester within 64-62, but Kevin Bell made two free throws to
seal the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "We can overcome and we can play with anybody in this country,"
said Burns, who has committed to UCLA. "We're underrated."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona-bound guard Hassan Adams scored 17 points for Westchester,
which made only one of 16 attempts from three-point range.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Jamal Boykin scored 10 points for Fairfax, which is 1-2
against Westchester this season, having lost by two to the Comets in
the Westchester tournament Dec. 8.</TE>

<LD>Coach Alvin Gentry made it clear Friday that he does not expect Corey
Maggette to score 28 points in every game while he fills in for Lamar
Odom as the Clippers' starting small forward. Odom is expected to be
sidelined at least three weeks because of a sprained right wrist.</LD>
<LD>   Gentry said he does expect Maggette to play sound defense, rebound
well and give the Clippers a spark. Gentry knows 28-point games, such
as the one Maggette put together Wednesday against the Lakers, will
be rare.</LD>
<LD>   "When he's on a roll, we're going to go to him," Gentry said.
"I've never discouraged a guy from shooting. You can't take away
opportunities from a guy." Gentry was asked about a private
conversation he had with Maggette after Tuesday's workout at L.A.
Southwest College. He wouldn't divulge details but smiled and said,
"We had a nice talk."</LD>
<TE>   Maggette did not score in 17 minutes Monday against the Denver
Nuggets. But he outscored Kobe Bryant by a point in the Clippers'
95-90 victory Wednesday over the Lakers. Maggette established a
career high by scoring 28 points earlier this season against
Toronto's Vince Carter.</TE>
<TE>   "He's had some good games and some games where he's struggled,"
Gentry said of Maggette, averaging 11 points and 3.5 rebounds. "Most
of the time, he's been pretty effective for us."</TE>

<HD>Irvine Proudly Christens Its New Stadium</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's no secret in the baseball community that South Orange County
annually produces an abundance of top high school and college
players.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday night at UC Irvine, it was evident that the area does
not lack for college baseball fans as well. A sellout crowd of 3,083
packed renovated Anteater Ballpark for Irvine's first game in almost
10 years. As this edition went to press, the Anteaters were trailing
San Diego, 8-5, in the bottom of the eighth inning.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a great feeling to see this kind of turnout," Irvine
Athletic Director Dan Guerrero said. "We've been waiting for this day
for a long time."</LD>
<TE>   Irvine dropped its program after the 1992 season because of budget
cuts. Seven months later, Guerrero, a former baseball player at UCLA,
was hired as athletic director and began working to bring the sport
back. In 1999 Irvine students voted to increase fees for athletic
funding so baseball and other sports could be reinstated.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan Corpuz, a freshman from Oxnard, was among the spectators
who arrived 90 minutes before Friday's game to stake out a spot on
the grassy knoll that runs the length of the right-field line.</TE>
<TE>   "Having a baseball team brings back enthusiasm and togetherness,"
Corpuz said. "I like going to the basketball games here, and this
gives students another activity to get involved in."</TE>
<TE>   As Irvine players watched San Diego take batting practice,
freshman infielder-pitcher Matt Anderson said the Anteaters were
eager to get the season--and their Division I careers--started. "This
is the first D-I game for everyone on the team, so I think the first
few innings we'll be getting the butterflies out," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   The stadium, built on the site of Irvine's old baseball field,
cost $3.9 million. It features 900 permanent seats, major
league-quality dugouts and a state-of-the-art scoreboard with a
full-color video screen, the only one of its kind at a college
baseball venue on the West Coast. The second phase of construction,
pending more fund-raising, will include expanded seating, a permanent
press box and a clubhouse behind the third-base dugout, Guerrero
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We built it as a place to host [NCAA] regionals," said Irvine
Coach John Savage, who was hired in July 2000 and has been involved
in almost every aspect of the program's resurrection. Guerrero said
that 300 season tickets and 100 seat options have been sold.</TE>
<TE>   Those in professional baseball were impressed with opening
night--and happy to have another first-rate facility to find talent.</TE>
<TE>   "This gives us another place to be on a Friday or Saturday night,"
said Joe Butler, a West Coast scout for the Chicago White Sox. "It
allows scouts to see high school games in the area in the daytime and
a college game at night."</TE>
<TE>   Agent Scott Boras, who lives in the Newport Coast area of Newport
Beach, said he is especially pleased with the stadium's location.
"It's wonderful because our office is just around the corner," Boras
said. "It's an extra place to see college baseball and the program is
going to be one of the top programs in the nation."</TE>

<HD>Panthers Pick Giants' Fox as New Coach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>After a 1-15 season and the firing of George Seifert, the Carolina
Panthers on Friday hired John Fox as their new coach, hoping the New
York Giant defensive coordinator can pump energy into the team.</LD>
<LD>   Fox, never a head coach at any level, got a glowing review from
Wellington Mara. The Giants' owner reminded Panther owner Jerry
Richardson he had also recommended Vince Lombardi and Tom Landry for
head coaching jobs during their careers.</LD>
<LD>   "[Mara] was absolutely the most enthusiastic supporter for John,"
Richardson said. "In doing our research, the thing that kept coming
back from everyone was John's energy level and enthusiasm."</LD>
<TE>   Fox was actually Carolina's third choice for the job. They were
spurned by Steve Spurrier, who went to the Washington Redskins, and
Tony Dungy, who went to the Indianapolis Colts.</TE>
<TE>   Dungy even interviewed with Carolina after Fox had his first
meeting with team officials. But after Dungy took the Colt job, they
went back to Fox.</TE>
<TE>   When Fox finally received the offer, a four-year deal worth about
$1 million annually, he felt relieved that his chase for a head
coaching job had finally ended.</TE>
<TE>   "I think maybe I let out a sigh," Fox said. "It's been a long
process. I always had the philosophy that I was going to do the best
darn job in the one I have and someone will notice and I'll finally
get it."</TE>
<TE>   He wasted no time explaining how things were going to be in
Carolina, where the Panthers failed to win after Week 1 and ranked
last in the league in offense and defense.</TE>
<TE>   He said he learned from former Pittsburgh Steeler coach Chuck Noll
that the only way a team can be successful is to "stop the run and be
able to run the ball."</TE>
<TE>   "We will work on running the ball," he said. "Is that all I'll do?
No. But you have to be able to do that in this league."</TE>
<TE>   He also went to work on assembling his staff, receiving permission
from the Baltimore Ravens to interview linebacker coach Jack Del Rio
for the defensive coordinator position.</TE>
<TE>   Fox set no timetable for filling out his staff, but it's possible
he could keep four coaches from George Seifert's staff. Linebacker
coach Sam Mills, offensive line coach Paul Boudreau, special team
coach Scott O'Brien and Richard Williamson, who will probably take a
demotion from offensive coordinator to become wide receiver coach,
are all candidates to remain with the team.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten days after posting one of the biggest upsets of the season, Santa
Barbara received a shock of its own Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Dons, who had not lost a Channel League game since the sport
debuted in the 1996-97 season, let a two-goal halftime lead slip away
against Ventura and lost, 7-6, at Ventura High, ending their league
winning streak at 37 games.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura Coach Mark Schmidt had scouted Santa Barbara several times
this season, including the Dons' upset over then second-ranked Santa
Margarita in the semifinals of the Santa Barbara Tournament of
Champions on Jan. 12, and liked his team's chances.</LD>
<TE>   Now, he can sit back and enjoy the ride when Ventura travels to
Santa Barbara for their final league meeting Feb. 7.</TE>
<TE>   "What's good is it puts the pressure on them now," Schmidt said.
"If we had lost, it would have been tough to go to their place and
get a victory."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura goalkeeper Addie Reyes had a strong game against Santa
Barbara (12-5, 3-1), which began this week ranked fourth by The
Times. She stopped 11 shots, including four in the last five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars (16-4, 4-0 in league) trailed, 6-5, at the start of
the fourth quarter and got a big lift when Santa Barbara's Lauren
Boreta, the Channel League player of the year last season, fouled out
with just under six minutes remaining. Three seconds later, Ventura's
Solange Webster tied the score off an assist from Elizabeth Derse.</TE>
<TE>   Reyes kept the Dons in check for several possessions before
Dolores Johnson scored the go-ahead goal, her third of the game, with
56 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bring it on: Bell Gardens is having a difficult time finding good
competition lately. The Lancers (19-0) thought they might get pushed
by Montebello on Tuesday in an Almont League game, but scored nine
goals in the first quarter and cruised, 18-5, at Bell Gardens.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the teams in our league are so bad, we're trying to find
a way not to score but still play water polo," Coach Robert
Greenamyer said.</TE>
<TE>   The three-time defending Southern Section Division III champions
get their biggest test next week at the Southern California
Championships at Irvine's Heritage Park. It will be the Lancers'
first opportunity to play top-ranked Santa Ana Foothill since the
Knights ended Bell Gardens' 85-game winning streak at the same
tournament last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Against all odds: Agoura has only one starter from last season's
team that beat Santa Barbara for the Division II title, but that
didn't prevent the Chargers from clinching a share of their fourth
consecutive Marmonte League title with a 12-1 victory over visiting
Simi Valley Royal on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought we might have a down year after graduating nine girls
from last year's team," Coach Jason Rosenthal said. "But we're coming
together at the right time."</TE>
<TE>   Agoura (15-4, 6-0) can clinch the title outright with a victory at
Thousand Oaks on Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Tryon's Hanging Around, Barely</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his debut as the youngest rookie in PGA Tour history, 17-year-old
Ty Tryon already reached one of his goals.</LD>
<LD>   "I made it to the weekend," he said.</LD>
<LD>   True, but only because it was too dark to finish his second round
in the Phoenix Open at Scottsdale, Ariz., on Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Unless he makes eagle on his final three holes when he returns
Saturday--that would be more amazing than earning his PGA Tour card
despite having two years of high school remaining--Tryon's first
tournament of the year will end most unceremoniously.</TE>
<TE>   On a day when Duffy Waldorf holed some long putts to take the lead
and John Daly sent the raucous crowds into a frenzy, the teen-ager
sputtered along and remained at six-over for the tournament when play
was suspended by darkness.</TE>
<TE>   "A great experience," Tryon said. "I felt a lot more comfortable
with the crowds."</TE>
<TE>   Not many watched Waldorf, and they missed him chipping in for
birdie from 25 feet, holing two long birdie putts and also a
35-footer for eagle. It added up to his second straight six-under 65,
putting him at 130 at the halfway point.</TE>
<TE>   He had a one-stroke lead over Vijay Singh (65) and Rory Sabbatini
(64).</TE>
<TE>   Chris DiMarco (64) and Skip Kendall (66) were at 132.</TE>
<TE>   Daly was another stroke back after a 65, but he was the easiest
guy to find on the TPC of Scottsdale. Just look for the mammoth
crowds, which Daly didn't disappoint.</TE>
<TE>   He birdied his first three holes and was two strokes off the lead
and facing a 50-foot eagle putt. That's where the momentum slowed.</TE>
<TE>   He three-putted for par, then walked through the tunnel to the
16th arena to the chants of "Da-lee! Da-lee!" His nine-iron from 171
yards landed past the hole and went over the green and he made a nice
par save.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether they were drinking or they were sober, they were pulling
for me," he said. "I like it when it gets a little rowdy. I feed off
that."</TE>
<TE>   Daly is No. 50 in the world ranking and needs to stay there for
seven more weeks to make the Masters, so a good start to the year is
important.</TE>
<TE>   Waldorf is also eager to start strong, for no other reason than
last year was his worst on the PGA Tour in 11 years--only one top 10
finish, and 120th on the money list.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I needed to improve my short game and chipping and
putting," Waldorf said. "I've been trying to be a little more
aggressive around the greens."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Open champion Retief Goosen conquered blustery afternoon
winds to take a one-shot lead after the second round of the Johnnie
Walker Classic at Perth, Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Goosen was the only golfer to conquer the winds, shooting a
four-under 68 to move to six-under 138 in the joint European,
Australasian and Asian PGA tours event.</TE>
<TE>   Goosen, from South Africa, moved as high as eight-under before two
late bogeys.</TE>
<TE>   Goosen's effort was tempered by withdrawals by Scotland's Colin
Montgomerie with a back injury, and Australia's Aaron Baddeley with
tonsillitis.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie could be sidelined for several weeks or longer.</TE>
<TE>   First-round leader Thong Chai Jaidee shot an even-par 72 to be at
five-under, one stroke back of Goosen.</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Garcia of Spain and Pierre Fulke of Sweden were at
two-under par.</TE>

<HD>Bryant to Get Extension Offer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers will offer Kobe Bryant a three-year, $54.8-million
contract extension, the maximum allowed under the collective
bargaining agreement, after the season, and Bryant might not accept.</LD>
<LD>   In the third year of a six-year extension that expires after the
2004-05 season, Bryant is due $40.5 million in the next three
seasons.</LD>
<LD>   Then, by the same process that brought teammate Shaquille O'Neal a
three-year, $88.4-million extension 11/2 years ago, Bryant would be
due $16.4 million, $18.3 million and $20.1 million through the
2007-08 season.</LD>
<TE>   "I haven't decided yet," Bryant said Friday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Including a final-year owners' option almost certain to be
exercised, the collective bargaining agreement expires after 2004-05,
the same time as Bryant's contract. Bryant voted against the
agreement then and remains opposed to it.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, he could opt to sign a new free-agent contract under
the next agreement, with the assumption that that agreement would be
more player friendly, with a less restrictive salary-cap structure.</TE>
<TE>   Given the economic climate of a sport on the verge of a payroll
luxury tax, already garnishing parts of its players' contracts for an
escrow account, and having just agreed to a six-year, $4.6-billion
television deal, Bryant, by waiting, also might risk a tighter cap.</TE>
<TE>   While Laker General Manager Mitch Kupchak refused to divulge
whether he had already contacted Bryant's representative, Arn Tellem,
on the matter of the extension, he did say the offer "absolutely"
would be made.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intent would be to keep Kobe Bryant with us as long as
possible," Kupchak said, "however he chooses to go about it."</TE>
<TE>   The extension could amount to a three-year standing offer to
Bryant, as he mulls the changes in the league and organization.</TE>
<TE>   He will be 26 and just entering his basketball prime when his
current contract is done, with at least two championships part of his
resume. The Lakers could pay him more over a longer period if he
chooses free agency, but that, again, is the rule under the current
bargaining agreement. That, too, could change.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Coach Phil Jackson has said that he "probably" would serve
out his five-year contract and leave the team after the 2003-04
season. O'Neal has said that he would follow Jackson out of town, two
years before his contract would end, and leave nearly $62 million on
the table.</TE>
<TE>   Both could change their minds, O'Neal especially, a scenario
Bryant presumably would find attractive. His relationships with both
appear to have grown.</TE>
<TE>   In even his most difficult times, when he feuded with Jackson and
O'Neal, Bryant insisted that he wanted to spend his career as a
Laker. His ambivalence regarding the contract extension would appear
to be a business decision, rather than a basketball or personal one.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, he would have personal reasons to stay. Despite spending
five years in suburban Philadelphia after moving from Italy, Bryant
has ties in the Southland. His wife, Vanessa, and her family are
rooted in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal continues to make headway with his ailing feet. After
playing the season's first three months in size-22 shoes, O'Neal
asked his company--Starter--to make them a size larger. The roomier
23s allow him to wrap his arthritic big toe. As a result, he said,
he's feeling less pain.... After sitting out against the Clippers
because of a sore right hamstring, Robert Horry returned Friday
against the San Antonio Spurs.</TE>

<HD>Timberwolves Won't Panic After Latest Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A second consecutive loss and three losses in five games could be the
signs of an emerging slump. Flip Saunders says his Minnesota
Timberwolves are mentally tough enough to snap out of it.</LD>
<LD>   Vince Carter scored 19 points and five other Raptors reached
double figures as Toronto defeated Minnesota, 107-100, Friday night
at Toronto. The Timberwolves lead the NBA in field-goal percentage
but shot only 43% against Toronto.</LD>
<LD>   Chauncey Billups had 17 points for the Timberwolves, who had won
12 of 13 before their recent slide.</LD>
<TE>   "Our guys know how to get through rough times," said Saunders,
whose team dealt with the death of Malik Sealy almost two years ago.
"They had to play when their teammate was in a coffin, so losing to
Detroit by 20 [on Wednesday] is a minor thing."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Garnett went five for 14 from the field, finishing with only
15 points for the Timberwolves, who never led.</TE>
<TE>   "This team doesn't get too high after a win over the Lakers and
doesn't get too low after a big loss," Saunders said. "It's why we
haven't had any terrible losing streaks."</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Davis had 18 points, Keon Clark had 16 and 10 rebounds and
Jerome Williams had 13 rebounds and 10 points for the Raptors, who
were criticized by Davis after their loss Wednesday to New York.</TE>
<TE>   "We're capable of doing this every night," Davis said. "I'm trying
to step up and be a vocal leader."</TE>
<TE>   The Raptors, who had lost their previous four games against
Minnesota, shot a season-high 63% in the first half and led 61-43.</TE>
<TE>   Williams took pleasure in outrebounding Sam Mitchell, 7-0, on the
offensive end.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate that Sam Mitchell is 38 years old. He's going up
against JYD and the dog pound," Williams said. "It's going to be a
long night. When I'm 38, I'm bowing out."</TE>
<TE>   Garnett's layup narrowed Toronto's lead to three in the first
quarter, but Toronto went on a 29-9 run as Clark scored 12 on a
variety of short jumpers and hook shots. Clark's driving hook shot
gave Toronto a 23-point lead with 5:14 left in the second.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 90, Charlotte 81--Jalen Rose scored 23 points, including
10 consecutive in the fourth quarter, and the Pacers made six free
throws in the final minute to hold off the Hornets at Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte cut an 18-point first-half deficit to four in the third
quarter and trailed by six after a basket by Jamaal Magloire with
less than two minutes to go.</TE>
<TE>   The Hornets had a chance to cut into that lead after Indiana
failed to get the ball across the time line, but Jermaine O'Neal
blocked a shot by Baron Davis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 106, Boston 90--Allen Iverson set a FleetCenter
scoring record with 47 points as the visiting 76ers reached .500 for
the first time in almost two months.</TE>
<TE>   Dikembe Mutombo had 15 points and 17 rebounds and Derrick Coleman
had 11 and 11 in his first game back after missing four with a foot
injury. The 76ers (21-21) have defeated Boston eight consecutive
times.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Pierce had 30 points and 13 rebounds for the Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 107, Atlanta 90--Chucky Atkins scored 21 points and
Corliss Williamson had 20 at Atlanta for the Pistons, who have won
five of seven.</TE>
<TE>   The Pistons made 30 of 33 free throws, including a combined
24-of-25 effort by Atkins, Williamson and Jerry Stackhouse. Atkins
made six of his three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   The Hawks, with leading scorer Shareef Abdur-Rahim serving the
second game of a three-game suspension, have lost two in a row and
eight of nine.</TE>

<HD>Warner Back at Ram Practice</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Kurt Warner said Friday his bruised ribs feel fine. The Rams aren't
taking any chances with the NFL's most valuable player.</LD>
<LD>   Warner will wear a protective flak jacket for Sunday's NFC
championship game against Philadelphia, as well as some extra padding
over the area injured during the victory over Green Bay a week
earlier. Although he sat out Thursday, he practiced Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "Basically it's a pain-tolerance question and how much I can deal
with," he said, noting he isn't otherwise limited in the throws he
can make.</LD>
<TE>   Said Ram cornerback Aeneas Williams: "Kurt looked fine. He'll be
the Kurt Warner that you guys have grown accustomed to seeing."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia defensive end Hugh Douglas, fined $35,000 by the
league this week for a hit that knocked Chicago quarterback Jim
Miller out of last Saturday's game, said he won't hesitate to hit
Warner if, say, the quarterback tries to make a tackle on an
interception return. The Eagles sacked Warner four times in a 20-17
overtime loss in the season opener.</TE>
<TE>   "Put it like this: If Kurt's in the vicinity, Kurt's going to get
hit," he said. "I'm not going to go out of my way looking for Kurt
Warner. Whoever it is, they're going to get hit. Especially if my man
is going to score."</TE>
<TE>   A pressing concern for Philadelphia is the condition of Pro Bowl
cornerback Troy Vincent, nursing a groin injury. He practiced Friday
and said he felt good.</TE>
<TE>   "I have another day and a half to rest, so I feel like I'm ready
to go," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to see what my body could do, and what it couldn't
do. I got a pretty good gauge of where I was."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Houston Texans got their first look Friday at a shopping list of
135 players left unprotected for the Feb. 18 expansion draft. And as
expected, the other teams didn't do the NFL's 32nd franchise any
favors.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, the Texans would love to have three-time all-pro left tackle
Tony Boselli of Jacksonville or seven-time all-pro offensive lineman
Willie Roaf of New Orleans.</LD>
<LD>   But as General Manager Charley Casserly and Coach Dom Capers
discovered, the list was filled with high-priced veterans who carry
huge salary cap implications.</LD>
<TE>   "When you initially see the list, it's exciting," Capers said.
"Then you go through the list and you start to project, will he be
there in three or four years? Does he fit the master plan?</TE>
<TE>   "Then, you start to look at it a little different. Fans will read
a lot of the names on the list but there are a lot of things that go
into this."</TE>
<TE>   Starting cornerbacks Aaron Glenn and Marcus Coleman were left
unprotected by the New York Jets and Baltimore exposed linebacker
Jamie Sharper and return specialist Jermaine Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   What Casserly and Capers must decide is how many players from the
expansion draft, free agents and the April 20-21 college draft can
fit into their salary cap for the upcoming season.</TE>
<TE>   Boselli, a seven-year veteran, has been one of the league's best
offensive linemen, but he sat out most of the 2001 season after
operations on both shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   The Texans would love Boselli protecting the quarterback prospect
they choose. But Boselli comes with a cap price of $6.5 million to $7
million next season.</TE>
<TE>   Complete expansion draft list on D14.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Buffalo Bills fired offensive coordinator Mike Sheppard.</TE>
<TE>   Sheppard was hired by Coach Gregg Williams last February. He spent
the previous two years as quarterbacks coach in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   The Bills were 3-13, their worst season in 16 years.</TE>

<KH>AUSTRALIAN OPEN / MEN</KH>
<HD>Even Johansson, Safin Didn't See It Coming</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>Self-confidence is one thing, but even Thomas Johansson would have
politely wondered about the health of someone making a pretournament
prediction that put him in the Australian Open final.</LD>
<LD>   Had he been told that, the Swede said he would have had a
pragmatic response:</LD>
<LD>   "I think you should go see a doctor."</LD>
<TE>   In keeping with the theme of disbelief, former U.S. Open champion
Marat Safin of Russia was even more blunt about his survival skills
after falling behind two sets to one against Tommy Haas of Germany in
their semifinal Friday. If rain had not fallen, stopping play for
almost 45 minutes after the first game of the fourth set, Safin knew
things would have turned out differently.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I had no chance, no chance," he said. "I had no chance to
win if it doesn't rain."</TE>
<TE>   When raindrops splashed on the court of Rod Laver Arena, Safin
thrust his arms in the air. For him, it was a victory to escape the
elements. The real victory came after the break, with the roof
closed, when a reinvigorated Safin won 11 of the final 13 games,
beating Haas, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (4), 3-6, 6-0, 6-2, in nearly 41/2 hours.</TE>
<TE>   You could easily assess the final two sets: a Haas with no game.
He finished the match by double-faulting.</TE>
<TE>   "My legs were already really heavy before we went back into the
locker room, and I don't think the break obviously helped me much,"
Haas said. "When I came back out on the court I just kind of had to
start over a little bit and he came out on fire."</TE>
<TE>   With one assist from the weather and another from a well-timed,
three-minute injury break in the second set, Safin reached his first
Grand Slam final since winning the U.S. Open in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   He was slightly defensive about the controversial injury timeout.
Safin made the move when he was down a service break in the second
set, having lost the first.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not?" Safin asked. "Why not? If you are injured or if you
have something bothering you, you can call the doctor, it says in the
rules."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Australian Open have often been flexible with the
rules.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it has to be crucial," Haas said. "Obviously, if you
start cramping up and you can see that a guy cannot go on any more,
then I think it's OK. But if it's just to maybe throw the opponent
off a little bit or try to get a break to calm down, I think it's not
fair."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, there has been little controversy along the way to
the final for Johansson. Seeded 16th, he has never gone this far
before in a Grand Slam event.</TE>
<TE>   Though Johansson put in many long hours on the court, his road to
the final did not feature any major upsets. In the lower part of the
draw, which was ravaged by injury and upsets, others did the dirty
work. For instance, Johansson beat his countryman Jonas Bjorkman in
the quarterfinals. Bjorkman had taken out Tim Henman in the previous
round.</TE>
<TE>   In three previous matches, Safin has defeated Johansson twice,
including last year's U.S. Open, beating him in four sets in the
round of 16. But the Swedish player has the luxury of two days off
between his semifinal match and the final, which will be played on
his 22nd birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Another hot day is expected. "I hope it'll rain again," Safin
said.</TE>

<LD>It wasn't a picture-perfect goal, but when Cameron Kolovos' deflected
shot found the back of the net early in the second half of the Sunset
League boys' soccer game at Fountain Valley High on Wednesday, Los
Alamitos was on the way to its fourth consecutive shutout.</LD>
<LD>   The 1-0 win was the 11th victory in a row for Los Alamitos
(18-1-1, 6-0 in league), ranked No. 5 by The Times, and it marked the
second time in three weeks that the Griffins defeated No. 8 Fountain
Valley by that score.</LD>
<LD>   "A redirected shot is a keeper's nightmare," Los Alamitos Coach
Trey Scharlin said about Kolovos' 14th goal of the season. "It's
tough to readjust when a ball is deflected."</LD>
<TE>   Kolovos ran down a long cross from Jon Bornstein before letting
loose a right-footed shot that was headed toward the right corner of
the net before deflecting off Fountain Valley's Robert Rossy and
bouncing slowly inside the left post.</TE>
<TE>   Fountain Valley (13-3-2, 3-3) had a good opportunity to score
midway through the second half, when Alex Soria ran down a long ball,
but his lofted shot over onrushing goalkeeper Geremy Uhl went about
five feet over the goal.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a few chances, but we didn't execute them," Fountain
Valley Coach Jason Smith said. "But they had more chances than us.
[Goalkeeper Kyle Polak] came up with some big saves. He kept us in
the game."</TE>
<TE>   John Ortega</TE>

<TE>   Torrance Bishop Montgomery 2, Playa del Rey St. Bernard 0--Lyle
Estrada and Sean Massey each scored a goal for host Bishop Montgomery
(10-6-1, 5-0) in the Del Rey League game.</TE>
<TE>   It was Bishop Montgomery's 30th consecutive victory in league
without a tie, tying the Southern Section record set by San Gabriel
from 1970-73.</TE>
<TE>   In girls' water polo:</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Foothill 9, Newport Harbor 3--Gabbie Domanic and
Brittany Hayes had three goals each and top-ranked Foothill extended
its winning streak to 39 games in a nonleague game at Newport Harbor
High.</TE>
<TE>   The Knights (16-0) built a 5-0 lead before No. 4 Newport Harbor
finally shot the ball past Foothill goalkeeper Emily Feher with two
seconds remaining in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   The Sailors couldn't get off a shot with a man advantage early in
the third quarter and Hayes responded by scoring two goals 39 seconds
apart in the third quarter to extend the lead to 7-1.</TE>

<HD>Road to Olympic Super-G Ends in Tears for Street</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hiding her face, Picabo Street sat in the snow and cried.</LD>
<LD>   She finished 33rd in a World Cup super-G race Friday at Cortina
D'ampezzo, Italy, meaning she won't get a chance to defend her
Olympic title at the Salt Lake City Games.</LD>
<LD>   It was Street's fourth consecutive poor World Cup showing in the
super-G and prevented her from making the U.S. team in that event.
She did qualify for the Olympics in the downhill.</LD>
<TE>   "You know, I was thinking at the top today that this is my last
super-G," said Street, who will race in today's downhill, then skip
World Cup events next week in Are, Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   Hilde Gerg of Germany won Friday's race in 1 minute 17.20 seconds,
edging Renate Goetschl of Austria by 0.01 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Street was 2.61 seconds behind, then sat nearly motionless for 10
minutes in the finish area, sobbing. A young teammate, Jonna Mendes,
finally came to lead Street away as other skiers continued to arrive.</TE>
<TE>   Street, 30, eventually smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just me being me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, my best maybe just isn't good enough. And that's OK,
that's human."</TE>
<TE>   Street will have her shot at an Olympic medal in the downhill,
which has been her best event, the surprise super-G gold at the 1998
Nagano Games notwithstanding.</TE>
<TE>   Mendes said Street has a good chance to add to the downhill silver
medal she won at the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics, five years after
recovering from her first knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   "Downhill is still where it's at for Picabo," Mendes said. "Now
she can focus only on that and ski fast."</TE>
<TE>   Street has made it clear this is her final season but has wavered
on whether she'll retire immediately after the Salt Lake City Games
or after the World Cup circuit finishes later in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing," Street said, "is definite."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The messy fight on the U.S. women's bobsled team ended when Jen
Davidson withdrew her complaint against driver Jean Racine.</TE>
<TE>   Davidson had protested when Racine abruptly replaced her a week
before the Olympic trials in December, and she asked an arbitration
judge Thursday to allow her a chance to make the team.</TE>
<TE>   The arbitration hearing was conducted near the team's training
site in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "The athletes are back to training," Matt Roy, director of the
U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton Federation, said late Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   J.J. Thomas and Sandra Van Ert earned wild-card spots when coaches
completed the roster for the U.S. Olympic snowboard team.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve of the 14 spots were predetermined, based on results in
qualifying events over the last several months.</TE>
<TE>   Ross Powers and Shannon Dunn, winners of bronze medals in the 1998
Olympics, were the top qualifiers on the half pipe team. Jeff
Greenwood and Rosey Fletcher were the top qualifiers on the parallel
giant slalom.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bobsledder Dave Owens was suspended from Olympic competition for
two years after testing positive for a banned steroid, the U.S.
Anti-Doping Agency said.</TE>
<TE>   Owens, 33, of Tulsa, Okla., tested positive for testosterone in
July. He was undergoing testosterone replacement therapy for
testicular cancer and applied for a waiver from the International
Olympic Committee's Medical Commission in April. The waiver was
denied. Owens has retired from the sport.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   France beat Norway by nearly 2 minutes in a Biathlon World Cup
30-kilometer women's relay at Anterselva, Italy. Slovakia was third,
China fourth.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team of Carolyn Tracy, Jill Krause, Tracy Barnes and
Lanny Barnes was 13th of 14 teams, 8:20 off the pace.</TE>

<HD>Squirtle Squirt Has Turned Out to Be a Bargain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After David Lanzman picked out and bought Squirtle Squirt at a Pomona
auction in 2000, he was happy and chagrined. Lanzman was happy that
he had to pay only $25,000 for the unraced colt--$5,000 less than
what the horse brought the first time he went through a sales
ring--but embarrassed later that he didn't know about the horse's bum
knee.</LD>
<LD>   "He had a chip in his right knee," Lanzman said. "I think I was
the only one at the sale that didn't know. I thought the horse would
have cost a lot more. I got him for about one-sixth of what his price
should have been."</LD>
<LD>   Squirtle Squirt is over his knee problems--he underwent surgery in
November 2000--and he has earned $1 million, a good chunk of it in
October when he upset Kona Gold to win the Breeders' Cup Sprint at
Belmont Park. That win is expected to earn Squirtle Squirt the
Eclipse Award for best sprinter when the championships are announced
Feb. 18.</LD>
<TE>   By then, Squirtle Squirt's 4-year-old campaign will already have
begun. His trainer, Bobby Frankel, has entered him against seven
rivals Sunday in the $150,000 Palos Verdes Handicap, which at six
furlongs is the same distance as the Breeders' Cup race.</TE>
<TE>   Lanzman, owner of a Los Angeles mortgage company, moved Squirtle
Squirt from trainer Joe Garcia to Frankel after the surgery. Garcia
had done good work with Squirtle Squirt, winning five races,
including the Hollywood Juvenile, but there were two things about
Frankel that appealed to Lanzman: He had trained Marquetry, Squirtle
Squirt's sire, and Lanzman sensed that Frankel was desperate to win a
Breeders' Cup race.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the Sprint was run at Belmont, Frankel was beyond
desperate, he was frothing at the mouth. A member of the Racing Hall
of Fame, Frankel had still failed to win with 36 Breeders' Cup
starters at the beginning of the day, and two of his best
chances--Flute and You--were beaten early on the card. Squirtle
Squirt, Frankel had said earlier in the week, had the fourth-best
chance among the horses he was running in six of the eight Breeders'
Cup races.</TE>
<TE>   Marquetry was a major stakes winner for Frankel. He won the
Hollywood Gold Cup at 11/4 miles in 1991. Arguably, Marquetry is the
most successful sire in Breeders' Cup history. Among the 1,461 horses
that have run in the Breeders' Cup since the program started in 1984,
only two have been sired by Marquetry and both won. Before Squirtle
Squirt, there was Artax, a winner of the Sprint in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   This is the 50th edition of the Palos Verdes, a race frequently
won by older horses, including Kona Gold as a 6-year-old in 2000 and
Men's Exclusive when he was an 8-year-old last year. At 9, the Wesley
Ward-trained Men's Exclusive is back, and in his 36th start he'll try
to become the first to win the stake in successive years since Native
Diver in 1964-65.</TE>
<TE>   Squirtle Squirt will carry 122 pounds, five more than Men's
Exclusive and Ceeband, who are next in the weights. Beaumes De Venise
drew the rail, and outside him in the gate will be Snow Ridge, Echo
Eddie, Squirtle Squirt, Explicit, Ceeband, Men's Exclusive and Silky
Sweep.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another Breeders' Cup winner, Spain, will try to hit the elusive
win column again in today's Santa Monica Handicap. Spain won the
Breeders' Cup Distaff in 2000 but has won only two of 11 starts
since.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Robert Strauss, a board member of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Cup
since 1988, was elected chairman Friday. Strauss was chairman of the
Democratic National Committee in the 1970s, worked in the cabinet of
President Jimmy Carter and was the U.S. ambassador to the Soviet
Union--later Russia--in the early 1990s. He succeeds John Mabee, who
stepped down late last year. Mabee's wife of 60 years, Betty Mabee,
was elected to the board, becoming only the second woman in track
history to serve in that capacity.</TE>

<HD>UCLA Coach's Degree Is From 'Diploma Mill'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS and STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA men's soccer Coach Todd Saldana is facing scrutiny for holding a
bachelor's degree from a university since shut down as an
unaccredited "diploma mill."</LD>
<LD>   UCLA requires its head coaches to have a bachelor's degree from an
accredited school.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been aware of the situation for a while but can't comment
because it involves a personnel issue and [Saldana] has obtained
legal counsel," said UCLA spokesman Marc Dellins, who declined to
comment on what, if any, action would be taken.</LD>
<TE>   Saldana was among thousands duped into believing the university
that issued his bachelor's degree was a reputable school, and never
intended to mislead anyone, said his attorney, Bruce Gelb.</TE>
<TE>   Saldana, who recently completed his third season, received a
bachelor's in psychology in 1997 from Columbia State University, shut
down the following year by the Louisiana attorney general's office
for allegedly turning out fictitious degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Reached at his home Friday, Saldana declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA administrators also refused to comment, although Dellins said
the issue surfaced before the well-chronicled resume problems of
George O'Leary caused a national uproar and his resignation as Notre
Dame football coach.</TE>
<TE>   "Todd believed that Columbia State University was a legally
accredited university.... He did take actual courses and he did have
textbooks that required him to read and, in some cases, write a
report on," said Gelb, who said Saldana completed classwork via the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an innocent victim of CSU as were apparently thousands of
others."</TE>
<TE>   Columbia State University was shut down in 1998 by Attorney
General Richard Ieyoub, who said consumers were lured to CSU by the
promise of an accredited degree. However, Ieyoub said: "There is no
school. No campus. No professors. Not one person qualified to run
such an institution of higher education. It's bogus--a complete
scam."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA is 43-17-4 in Saldana's tenure and he led the team to the
NCAA semifinals in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   He was a Bruin assistant from 1989-94, was men's and women's head
coach at Cal Poly Pomona in 1995-96, and was men's head coach at
Loyola Marymount in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to UCLA in 1998 as women's head coach.</TE>

<HD>Two Cuban Players Missing</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Cuban soccer players in Los Angeles to compete in the CONCACAF
Gold Cup have apparently skipped out on their team with the intention
of defecting.</LD>
<LD>   Attacking midfielder Rey Angel Martinez and forward Alberto
Delgado were reported missing by Cuban delegation officials on
Thursday night. Martinez, 21, and Delgado, 23, both of whom play for
Ciudad Habana in the Cuban league, supposedly told El Nuevo Herald,
the Miami Herald's Spanish-language edition, that they wanted to stay
in the United States and play in Major League Soccer.</LD>
<LD>   No one from either MLS or CONCACAF, which is staging the 12-nation
Gold Cup tournament in Pasadena and Miami, was available for comment
Friday evening.</LD>
<TE>   Cuba, which lost, 1-0, to the United States at the Rose Bowl on
Monday, was eliminated from the tournament by a scoreless tie with
South Korea on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The 23-member Cuban team was staying at a hotel in Burbank and the
players had been under tight security. According to reports, Martinez
and Delgado made their escape with the help of a friend who lives in
the area.</TE>
<TE>   They told El Nuevo Herald that they intended to travel to Miami.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Presumably, Steve Lavin has deleted Jamal Sampson's number from the
memory on his cell phone. It's safe to say Cedric Bozeman has it
stored.</LD>
<LD>   For Lavin, dialing the number did nothing but cause embarrassment.
For Bozeman, it enables two longtime friends to stay in touch, to
reminisce about past championships and plan the future.</LD>
<LD>   Sampson, a 6-foot-11 center, and Bozeman, a 6-6 guard, starred
together at Santa Ana Mater Dei High School and had their pick of
colleges. Bozeman committed to UCLA in his junior year. Sampson
proved a tougher catch, vacillating on his choice until finally
choosing California in November 2000.</LD>
<TE>   However, he hadn't signed yet when Lavin had his friend and
then-Dodger general manager Kevin Malone place a call from his cell
phone to Sampson's AAU coach, Pat Barrett.</TE>
<TE>   Sampson's home number was inadvertently dialed, and Malone left a
message chiding Barrett for not steering the player to UCLA.
Sampson's mother heard the message, and it became public.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific 10 Conference ruled that Malone had inserted himself
into the recruiting process as a representative of UCLA's athletic
interests and slapped Lavin with a secondary recruiting violation.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's clear why UCLA wanted Sampson. He is one of several
freshmen making an immediate impact in the conference, starting all
17 games for the surprising Bears, averaging eight points, eight
rebounds and two blocked shots.</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman wants UCLA to end its two-game losing streak and beat Cal
tonight, but he will be glad to see his friend.</TE>
<TE>   "We did everything together, man," he said. "We hung out,
carpooled together at times. We went to school together. We were a
one-two punch, on and off the court."</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman said a large contingent from Mater Dei will be at the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "My phone has been ringing off the hook," he said. "They will try
to get down here and support me and Jamal."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Like most Pac-10 teams, the Cal roster is full of Southland
products who consider the trip to USC and UCLA a homecoming.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Sampson, brothers Solomon and Gabriel Hughes are
from Torrance Bishop Montgomery High and brothers Ryan and Tashaan
Forehan-Kelly are from Irvine (Ryan attended Santa Margarita High,
Tashaan Woodbridge).</TE>
<TE>   Guard A.J. Diggs is from Long Beach Poly, guard Shantay Legans is
from Goleta Dos Pueblos, forward Brian Wethers is from Murrieta
Valley and forward Joe Shipp is from Fairfax.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rico Hines will probably sit out for the fourth consecutive game
because of a concussion.</TE>
<TE>   He did not practice Friday and will be evaluated by doctors during
a pregame workout on an exercise bicycle today. He will play only if
he has no headaches.</TE>

<TE>   Records--No. 13 UCLA 13-5, 5-3; California 14-3, 5-2.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Bears are off to their best start since 1959-60, when
they opened 15-1 under Coach Pete Newell and finished 28-2 and NCAA
runners-up. Shipp is a consistent scorer, reaching double figures 13
times and averaging 15 points. Diggs replaced Legans as the starting
point guard two weeks ago, although Legans played 35 minutes in Cal's
overtime victory over USC on Thursday, making the winning shot. The
Bears lead the Pacific 10 in most categories on defense. UCLA is in
danger of losing three in a row for the first time since falling on
the road to Syracuse, Arizona and Arizona State two years ago.</TE>

<HD>USC Faces a Rugged Climb Today</HD>
<DH>College basketball: After a disheartening loss to Cal in
overtime, Trojans have to rebound against No. 17 Stanford or they
fall out of Pac-10 lead.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>USC blew a shot at standing alone atop the Pacific 10 Conference
standings with Thursday night's improbable and last-second overtime
loss to California.</LD>
<LD>   But the Trojans, who are in a first-place tie with Oregon at 6-2,
have a shot at redemption today against No. 17 Stanford, which is
half a game behind at 5-2.</LD>
<LD>   "When you're at the top of the mountain, everybody's shooting for
you," USC Coach Henry Bibby said. "You're visible for everybody and
everybody's coming for you. We're giving people a reason to play
against us.</LD>
<TE>   "So your best game has to come up every night."</TE>
<TE>   The No. 23-ranked Trojans acknowledge they have to put Thursday's
heartbreaker behind them or risk being run out of the Sports Arena by
the Cardinal.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't lose two at home," USC senior Brandon Granville said.
"The urgency is there. It puts a little pressure on us that we've got
to go out and win [today], but that's what this league's about."</TE>
<TE>   Last week the Trojans were blown out at Arizona but rebounded two
days later with a win at Arizona State.</TE>
<TE>   "I can get over the big loss to Arizona without a problem,"
Granville said. "I can move on and accept just having one of those
nights. But [Thursday] night's tough. It may be a little tougher to
get over."</TE>
<TE>   Granville was at the flashpoint of USC's stunning loss to Cal.</TE>
<TE>   Nursing a 91-89 lead in overtime, the Trojans were trying to run
down the clock as Granville was trapped along the right sideline at
midcourt and stripped by A.J. Diggs with 14.6 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Granville and Diggs fell to the floor and a held-ball was called.
The possession arrow pointed to California.</TE>
<TE>   "[Diggs and Shantay Legans] both came out at me and I was going to
go and try to get away from the double team and [Diggs] cut me off,"
Granville said. "And I didn't want to go backcourt, so I kind of spun
off and back and lost my balance. I got bumped a little bit and as I
was falling I was trying to call timeout, but they got the jump
ball."</TE>
<TE>   With Granville guarding him, Legans then made a three-pointer from
23 feet out with two seconds remaining, giving the Golden Bears the
92-91 victory.</TE>
<TE>   USC had squandered a 10-point lead, 64-54, with 10 minutes to play
in regulation and led by four, 91-87, with 30 seconds to play in
overtime.</TE>
<TE>   USC freshman guard Errick Craven said the Trojans simply lost
focus.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's our main problem: When we come to a close game
like that and we have the lead, sometimes we stop playing," Craven
said. "We play not to lose instead of to win.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't pushing as much, we weren't as aggressive. We were
just holding the ball and they were just making the plays, so they
had more momentum at the end."</TE>
<TE>   Cal had been making a league-worst 29.6% of its three-point
attempts. The Golden Bears, however, set a school record against USC
with 15 three-pointers, making 53.6% (15 of 28).</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing we could do about that game," Bibby said. "There
are 15, 20 plays in the game that would have turned the game around
to our favor. It wasn't meant to be last night. The game wasn't meant
for us.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never played against a team in my whole career of coaching,
and I've coached a thousand-plus games, I've never seen a team shoot
the basketball so deep outside and make them consistently. I've never
seen that."</TE>
<TE>   So how do the Trojans pick themselves up for Stanford with such a
quick turnaround?</TE>
<TE>   "You kick what happened out the window and you start over again,"
Bibby said.</TE>
<TE>   That may be easier said than done, especially because USC was
outrebounded by Cal, 37-33, and the Trojans had only seven offensive
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   They came into the game averaging a league-best 15.1 offensive
rebounds and none of Trojan senior power forward Sam Clancy's 11
rebounds came on the offensive end.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford, meanwhile, began the week leading the Pac-10 in
rebounding margin (+9.2) and defensive rebounds (27.9).</TE>
<TE>   "They're very athletic, they're very quick," Bibby said. "[Julius]
Barnes, [Josh] Childress and [Casey] Jacobsen are so good. And you've
got [Curtis] Borchardt inside to block shots and take you outside.
It's a very good basketball team.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they've reached their potential yet. I think it's a
team that could explode any time with the people they have."</TE>

<HD>Pepperdine's Winning Streak Reaches 11</HD>

<LD>Pepperdine tied a school record with its 11th consecutive victory
Friday, and remained the only undefeated team in the West Coast
Conference with a 70-60 win over visiting Santa Clara, before 368 at
Firestone Fieldhouse.</LD>
<LD>   The Waves (14-4, 5-0) have not lost since a 77-71 overtime defeat
to Illinois on Dec. 8. But they are losing players. Forward Kelli
Spencer was lost for the season after suffering a left knee injury
last week at Portland. Center Shannon Mayberry, with a stress
fracture in her right leg, may be lost for the season. And starting
point guard Shandrika Lee injured her wrist during Friday's game and
is questionable for tonight's game against San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, Pepperdine, which trailed, 30-23, at halftime,
prevailed by holding the Broncos (13-5, 3-2) to 31.8% shooting from
the field (21 for 66), including a season-worst one for 17 on
three-point attempts.</LD>
<TE>   The Waves were cold in the first half (nine for 30) but warmed up
as the game went on, shooting 43% in the second half, and 36.2%
overall (21 for 58).</TE>
<TE>   Tamara McDonald led Pepperdine with 16 points, and made a crucial
three-pointer with 33 seconds left to give the Waves a 64-60 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Tammy Annas and Julie Butler each had 18 for Santa Clara.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Terry</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 19 Colorado State 57, Wyoming 49--Lisa Narkiewicz scored 13
points and Katie Borton had five of her 10 in the final two minutes
as the Rams won at Fort Collins, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Angie Gorton also had 10 points for Colorado State (16-3, 5-0
Mountain West). The Rams survived an off night from leading scorer
Ashley Augspurger to win their sixth consecutive. Augspurger was 0
for 12 shooting and held to four points.</TE>
<TE>   Carrie Bacon had 17 points for Wyoming (9-8, 2-3), which went more
than 12 minutes without a field goal and lost to Colorado State for
the 11th consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State 70, No. 23 Minnesota 66--Courtney Coleman had 16 points
and 10 rebounds, and Didi Reynolds made the go-ahead free throws with
5.1 seconds to play to lead the Buckeyes at Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman made two free throws with 1:24 left to give Ohio State
(10-10, 5-4 Big Ten) a 66-64 lead. But Minnesota (14-4, 4-3) tied it
on Kadidja Andersson's turnaround jumper 22 seconds later.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsey Whalen led the Gophers with 23 points.</TE>

<HD>Davis Won't Delay Insurance Plan</HD>
<DH>Health: Governor says up to 300,000 could be covered if the
Legislature finds $200 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS, LISA RICHARDSON and JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a reversal, Gov. Gray Davis late Friday said he would support
expansion this year of a popular health insurance program for
low-income families despite the financial pain it would cause.</LD>
<LD>   Davis pledged that he would not delay coverage of up to 300,000
low-income parents provided the state Legislature comes up with about
$200 million to pay for it. As recently as Friday afternoon, Davis'
aides had said an 18-month delay was needed to save money.</LD>
<LD>   His announcement came near the conclusion of an appearance with
U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy G. Thompson at an
East Los Angeles health clinic. Thompson approved a federal
government waiver allowing California to enroll parents and guardians
in a state program that already provides health insurance to children
of working-poor families.</LD>
<TE>   "California, here is your waiver," said Thompson, signing the
document and handing it to Davis.</TE>
<TE>   With the piece of paper came a political quandary, and the
governor struggled Friday to resolve it.</TE>
<TE>   Extending health coverage to parents is politically popular,
particularly among the liberals and moderates Davis needs to win
reelection in November. But with the state facing a budget deficit of
$12.4 billion, any new spending on health insurance would have to be
offset by costly borrowing or cuts to other politically popular
programs.</TE>
<TE>   In his comments Friday, Davis split the difference. He expressed
his administration's "genuine desire" and "readiness" to implement
the program by summer--while shifting the onus for funding the launch
to the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, California would put up more than $200 million
over two years to extend coverage to working parents of children who
receive insurance through the state's Medi-Cal and Healthy Families
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Under those programs, California provides medical coverage to
about 1 million children whose families earn less than 250% of the
federal poverty level. That is $44,125 per year for a family of four.</TE>
<TE>   The California plan would expand coverage to working parents,
though under a slightly more stringent formula. To be eligible, they
could earn up to 200% of the federal poverty level, or $35,300 for a
family of four.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government, under a 2-to-1 match per dollar spent,
would provide more than $400 million over two years.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll begin enrolling parents as soon as we can ... if not by
July 1, then soon after," Davis said in a brief interview. "There's a
genuine desire to move this forward. The question is if the
Legislature can find the money."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he had ideas for cuts or borrowing to offset the new
costs, Davis replied: "I don't even want to start." Some legislators
reacted with frustration to his actions, but said they would do what
they could to launch the program--perhaps in phases.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as we heard about the deal, we started looking for the
money," said state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San
Francisco). Maybe, he added, the money could be taken from some
"silly award things for education," a reference to one of Davis' pet
programs.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's predicament represented a political version of an
old lesson: Be careful what you wish for.</TE>
<TE>   The governor had first proposed the waiver--and the expansion of
coverage to adults--in December 2000, when the state was flush with
cash.</TE>
<TE>   But the federal government did not agree to the plan until this
week. With the state budget deficit rising, finding the money for the
state's share looked difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Since late last year, Davis and other state officials have
insisted that enrollment be delayed until July 2003, when more money
would be available for the state's share.</TE>
<TE>   But after word of the federal waiver came down this week, that
proposal drew criticism from the leading Republican candidate for
governor, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, health-care
activists and even some of Davis' fellow Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   They noted that under federal funding formulas, California would
lose hundreds of millions in matching funds during the delay.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson's decision to grant the waiver put Davis on the spot, and
talk in political circles Friday centered on whether the Bush
administration was trying to make life difficult for a Democratic
governor up for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "I wonder if Bush didn't do this to stick it up you-know-who's
you-know-what," Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson denied any political intent, saying California had only
recently adjusted its application for a waiver to reflect new federal
guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   The secretary also pointed out that the Bush administration
intends to make $3.2 billion in unspent funds for insuring children
available to the states in fiscal year 2003, rather than returning it
to the federal treasury.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, a former governor of Wisconsin, called Davis a friend
and joked that "I didn't know he was a Democrat."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the politics of the decision, Davis demurred. "We'd
rather have the waiver than not have."</TE>
<TE>   That statement matched the views of parents who stand to gain from
the program.</TE>
<TE>   Katie Reynoso's daughter receives health care under the Healthy
Families program, but she herself cannot afford the costs of signing
up for the state Medi-Cal program.</TE>
<TE>   Reynoso, who has an $800-a-month temporary job in the shipping
department of a Compton factory, and her husband, who makes $1,200 a
month at a furniture store, make do with annual checkups they receive
at a low-cost clinic.</TE>
<TE>   "It gets so expensive," Reynoso said. "We're low-income people,
and while I thank God that we have all that we need, I don't know
what we'll do if one of us ever really gets sick."</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-four-year-old Amalia Martinez, her husband and her family
survive on $800 a month that the couple earn sewing clothes.</TE>
<TE>   On occasion, the family has driven to a pharmacy in Tijuana.
There, they are prescribed medicines without a doctor's examination.</TE>
<TE>   Only after an illness stubbornly refuses to disappear and symptoms
worsen dramatically do they go to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Martinez came down with a high fever and nausea.
Finally she was rushed to an emergency room, where she was
successfully treated. The episode left the family $1,500 in debt--the
equivalent of almost two months' income.</TE>
<TE>   Now her husband has an ulcer but refuses to go to the doctor; they
can't afford more bills.</TE>
<TE>   "If I get sick my children suffer because there is no one to cook,
to clean their clothes and to take them to school," Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had health insurance, I would go to the doctor right away"
instead of simply waiting to get better.</TE>

<HD>New Dawn for Bowl Easter Service</HD>
<DH>Religion: Coin flip gives control to Trinity TV ministry.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eighty years of tradition was tossed aside with the flip of a coin
Friday as a controversial Orange County television ministry won control
of this year's Easter sunrise service at the Hollywood Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Trinity Broadcasting Network will produce and televise the March 31
pageant, replacing a venerable Los Angeles civic group that began staging
the religious spectacle in 1919.</LD>
<LD>   Executives at TBN, the world's largest Christian television network,
dismissed fears that their network's evangelical style would corrupt the
program's ecumenical tradition. "We'll have every Christian
denomination," promised programming coordinator Jay Jones.</LD>
<TE>   But critics of TBN--known for the glitzy sets, flamboyant on-air
personalities and lavish lifestyles of its founders, Paul and Jan
Crouch--were unmoved.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real shame," said Sandy Gorog, who braved the cold last year
to attend the Hollywood Bowl services, where her boss, the Rev. James H.
Morrison of Beverly Hills Presbyterian Church, spoke. "A long tradition's
been broken that gives people a chance to hear preachers in the
neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County, which owns the Hollywood Bowl, ordered the coin
toss to settle a dispute over rights to the Easter program after TBN,
which coveted the event, complained it was being unfairly excluded. The
current producer, Hollywood Bowl Easter Sunrise Service Inc., claimed TBN
forced the county into the coin flip by threatening to sue. TBN officials
said they simply asked for an equal shot at producing an event held in a
publicly owned facility.</TE>
<TE>   The 1973 Eisenhower silver dollar that settled the matter flew up
three feet before it fell to the carpeted floor, bounced once and then
rolled to the tasseled loafer of TBN television programming coordinator
John Casoria. When Casoria stepped back the coin showed tails--the
network's assigned side.</TE>
<TE>   It might have been divine intervention, Casoria allowed.</TE>
<TE>   "It hit my foot--the coin did what it did. I didn't have any control
over it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The process outraged leaders of the losing group.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry. This is not Las Vegas. This the Hollywood Bowl Easter
sunrise service," said Norma Foster, president of the nonprofit Sunrise
Service organization. "This is offensive."</TE>
<TE>Civic Group Plans to Challenge Process</TE>
<TE>   Members of Foster's group say their predecessors created the Hollywood
Bowl in 1921, two years after conducting the first sunrise service. And
they claim the amphitheater was eventually deeded to the county in
exchange for a 99-year renewable lease that guarantees them the use of
the bowl each Easter for $1 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Foster said her organization will challenge the county's decision to
use a coin-flip to select the group in charge of the annual Easter
program. But lawyers for her group conceded that fighting off TBN may not
be easy. "Finding the actual tract records is difficult," said attorney
Gerald Manpearl.</TE>
<TE>   Foster vowed to fight to "protect the rights of the thousands of kids
who have taken part in the living cross over the years," referring to the
children's choir that has formed the shape of a cross as one of the
signature events of past Easter services.</TE>
<TE>   A multidenominational tone has been a hallmark of the pageant,
America's best-known Easter sunrise service. Past services have included
a mixture of clergy and celebrities, with Hollywood personalities such as
Angie Dickinson, Mickey Rooney and Robert Stack sharing the bowl's stage
with religious figures from houses of worship such as the First A.M.E.
Church, the Leo Baeck Temple and the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In promising to be just as inclusive, TBN executive Jones said, "We
are under the assumption the Hollywood Bowl is for everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Gregory Emler, an elder at In His Presence Church in Studio City,
agreed. "Trinity Broadcasting would probably be one of the most reputable
sources I can recommend to do this. They will represent the real meaning
of Easter--no bunnies, no eggs. It will be straight to the point without
a lot of frills," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Dr. Edward J. Hansen of the Hollywood United Methodist Church
said it's too early to tell how the change will affect the sunrise events
at the Hollywood Bowl. But he said he appreciated the diversity included
in the prior services: "children's groups, ethnic groups, different
theological perspectives--all centered around this special day."</TE>
<TE>   Critics of Paul and Jan Crouch are irked that the couple enjoys
expensive houses, including a new Newport Beach estate reported to cost
$5 million. According to 2000 tax documents, Trinity Christian Center of
Santa Ana Inc., which oversees a network of regional TBN organizations as
well as overseas ventures, had $444 million in net assets. The Crouches
had a combined salary of more than $850,000.</TE>
<TE>Some Find Theology Flawed</TE>
<TE>   Some also believe that many TBN evangelists teach flawed theology.
"They are peddling spiritual cyanide by the megadose," said Hank
Hanegraaff, a best-selling author of Christian books whose works include
"Christianity in Crisis" and "Counterfeit Revival."</TE>
<TE>   Hanegraaff monitors the TBN broadcasts, looking for examples of
outrageous claims and apostasy. In 1999, he says, TBN star Benny Hinn
told viewers: "You're going to have people raised from the dead watching
TBN. . . . I see actually loved ones picking up the hands of the dead and
letting them touch the screen. . . ."</TE>
<TE>   The Crouches could not be reached for comment. But other TBN officials
voiced surprise Friday at the Easter service complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little disappointed and baffled to hear there's some anger,"
said Colby May, a TBN spokesman in Washington, D.C. He said the network
is "humbled and honored" to be awarded use of the Hollywood Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   May promised the Easter pageant will be ecumenical and centered on
Christ's resurrection, a theme that unites all Christian denominations. A
toll-free number will appear at the bottom on the screen during the
service for people needing prayer or wanting to make donations, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The superimposed telephone number could prove to be a sticking point
with the county. It harks back to a controversy in 1992, when TBN angered
bowl veterans by allegedly seizing control of the Hollywood Bowl Easter
Sunrise Service board of directors and taking over that year's program.
Under new rules drafted as part of the coin-toss procedure, such
fund-raising is not allowed, according to Elizabeth Hinckley, spokeswoman
for the Philharmonic Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said this year's sunrise telecast--which will be broadcast
worldwide--will not be used for fund-raising. "We raise money twice a
year through telethons," he said.</TE>
<TE>County Defends Its Approach</TE>
<TE>   Production for this year's pageant will begin immediately, Jones said.
Invited speakers could include prominent ministers Jack Hayford, Charles
Blake and Robert H. Schuller as well as actor Charlton Heston, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It will probably look a lot like it did 10 years ago," Jones said of
the Easter program.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, county officials pronounced themselves satisfied with
Friday's coin toss. A memo written by county lawyers and completed late
Thursday said such a selection process "is the most reasonable and
defensible approach" to avoid possible "unconstitutional discrimination."</TE>
<TE>   But as coin-flipper William Jacobs--a Philharmonic Assn. auditor who
works for Ernst &amp; Young--pocketed his silver dollar, the two sides seemed
in agreement that a more dignified process might be appropriate next
year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure that reasonable minds could come up with a reasonable
solution instead of leaving it to chance," said TBN's Casoria.</TE>

<LD>The Enron saga slipped from scandal to tragedy Friday as J.
Clifford Baxter, a former vice chairman of the company who was said to
have "complained mightily" about some of its off-the-books partnerships,
was found shot dead in his car, an apparent suicide.</LD>
<LD>   Baxter, 43, was one of five high-ranking Enron executives identified
in a whistle-blower's letter as objecting to accounting maneuvers that
ultimately pushed the company into bankruptcy. His death leaves a void
for investigators who had hoped to interview Baxter in connection with
several inquiries by Congress, regulators and federal agencies.</LD>
<LD>   Mitch Taylor, an executive in Enron's trading operation, called Baxter
a man of "extremely high integrity."</LD>
<TE>   "I don't believe he was complicitous in anything that may or may not
have gone on here," Taylor said. "But he was the vice chairman. It
happened on his watch. I'm sure he felt horrible."</TE>
<TE>   Baxter stepped down from the company in May, just seven months after
winning the vice chairman's post, saying he wanted to spend more time
with his wife and two school-age children.</TE>
<TE>   "He left here because he was frustrated," Taylor said. "He felt he was
going to be burdened with the responsibility for things that occurred but
given none of the responsibility to change them."</TE>
<TE>   Baxter's redbrick mansion in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land was
guarded Friday by three police officers. An American flag adorned the
frontdoor and the shutters were closed. Friends dropped in throughout the
day, greeted with hugs.</TE>
<TE>   "We are suffering the loss of our husband, father and best friend,"
the family said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend, Baxter's wife, Carol, reacted angrily when approached by
a reporter about the unfolding crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "People are being investigated. People are being sued," Carol Baxter
said outside her home.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to follow people for the rest of their lives--people
who didn't do anything wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Baxter's body was found by a police officer about 2:30 a.m. in a black
2002 Mercedes sedan parked near the Sweetwater Country Club, less than
two miles from his home.</TE>
<TE>   He suffered a single gunshot wound to the head, and a revolver was
found by his side, police said. Police said he also left a suicide note,
but declined to reveal its contents or say where it was found.</TE>
<TE>   CNBC reported that Baxter's suicide note said he was distraught over
the disintegration of Enron and the likelihood that he would have to
testify against friends who worked there. The news channel said Baxter
was unshaven and disheveled last week when a reporter visited his home
and his Christmas tree was still standing.</TE>
<TE>   A local justice of the peace ruled Baxter's death a suicide but
ordered an autopsy as part of the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter spent a decade at Enron during the years it morphed from a
middling operator of natural gas pipelines into a "new-economy" company
that placed high-tech bets through its computerized trading operation on
a wide range of energy and other commodities.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter zoomed up through the company in the slipstream of his good
friend Jeffrey K. Skilling, who resigned as Enron's chief executive in
August for unexplained personal reasons.</TE>
<TE>   A former Air Force captain, Baxter cashed out $28 million in stock
gains from the sale of nearly 800,000 Enron shares from 1998 to early
2001, according to an analysis by Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics.
Since then, Enron's stock price has plunged from about $81 a share, the
best price Baxter commanded, to mere pennies.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter and other current and former Enron executives have been sued by
angry shareholders, whose investments are virtually worthless. The suits
allege the executives were presenting a falsely positive view of the
company's financial health to boost the stock price.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter, although no longer with the company, would still have been
afforded legal representation for his work with Enron, a company
spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron issued a terse statement Friday: "We are deeply saddened by the
tragic loss of our friend and colleague, Cliff Baxter. Our thoughts and
prayers go out to his family and friends."</TE>
<TE>   Skilling expressed sadness at Baxter's apparent suicide.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Skilling is devastated by the loss of a very dear friend," said
Judy Leon, a spokeswoman for Skilling.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter was among those Enron executives mentioned in an Aug. 22 memo
by Sherron S. Watkins about Enron's growing financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Cliff Baxter complained mightily to Skilling and all who would listen
about the inappropriateness of our transactions," Watkins wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Skilling denied that he had ever had conversations with
Baxter or other Enron officials about accounting problems at Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter's records had been subpoenaed by the Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. But as of the time of his death, Baxter
had not delivered any documents, which were due by Jan. 31, according to
a source close to the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter was credited with helping build Enron's core trading business,
which provided most of the company's revenue in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Sources who were close to Baxter said Friday that he had challenged
Skilling on the controversial off-balance-sheet partnerships and resigned
because he had been unable to get them stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "He had enough money. He didn't have to work there anymore," one
colleague said. "Cliff would feel guilty about what he didn't do. That
was the nature of who he was."</TE>
<TE>   John Clifford Baxter was born Sept. 27, 1958, in Amityville, N.Y. He
was captain in the Air Force from 1980 to 1985 and went on to earn an MBA
from Columbia University's Business School, where he was 1987 class
valedictorian. He joined Enron in 1991 after a stint as an investment
banker.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter moved up through the ranks with Skilling and Andrew S. Fastow,
Enron's chief financial officer, ousted in October because of investor
discomfort over his management of two of the controversial
off-balance-sheet partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter had negotiated the $3-billion purchase of Portland General in
1997 and had worked on an aborted attempt to sell it to a California
entity. In 2000, Baxter was chairman and chief executive of Enron North
America and wanted to leave the company, sources said, but Skilling urged
him to reconsider.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter was given the job of chief strategy officer in June 2000 and
was named vice chairman just four months later. He was charged with
selling Enron's under-performing international assets in 2000 but had
only mild success.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter was an "idea man" who couldn't tolerate handling day-to-day
operations or nitty-gritty details that made a deal work, one former
executive said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a concept guy: 'I want to do this, but don't bother me with
the details.' He was very brash and arrogant," the former executive said.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter was also a vigorous smoker: "It was a sad day when they made
Enron a nonsmoking building," joked one former colleague.</TE>
<TE>   And he wasn't shy about the wealth he accumulated. He entertained
other Enron brass on his boat and at pool parties that neighbors in the
family's swank neighborhood watched from afar, uninvited.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter's taste in vehicles was elite and varied. He had a stable of
exotic cars, and no one ever knew which one would pull into the corporate
garage with Baxter at the wheel on any given day.</TE>
<TE>   "One day it would be a fancy BMW; the next day it would be a Ferrari,"
a former colleague said. "He made a lot of money, but he spent a lot of
money. . . . He liked a lot of toys."</TE>
<TE>   No one blinked an eye when Baxter decided to resign in May, the former
executive said. He had made a lot of money and was ready to "hang it up"
and spend time on his boat with his family.</TE>
<TE>   "People were laughing when Skilling left that Cliff must have told him
how much fun it was."</TE>
<TE>   A yachting enthusiast, Baxter joined the Houston Yacht Club in Clear
Lake 2 1/2 years ago. He kept his 70-foot cabin cruiser, named
Tranquility, at the club, volunteering time and money to help with club
regattas.</TE>
<TE>   The club runs four or five national regattas a year, attracting
national sailing personalities, said general manager Ross Tuckwiller, and
Baxter would pitch in, taking VIPs out on his boat to watch the races.</TE>
<TE>   He was seldom seen there without his wife and children.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very good supportive member," Tuckwiller said. "Very nice
guy and good to the staff. He was a great guy."</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Buckner, the volunteer commodore, or president, of the club,
said Baxter sold his cabin cruiser in the last few weeks and dropped out
of sight.</TE>
<TE>   A partner at Ernst &amp; Young in Houston, Buckner hadn't seen Baxter
since right before Christmas, when he expressed his dismay over the Enron
debacle.</TE>
<TE>   "He expressed how concerned he was about how people saw all of this,"
Buckner said.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter didn't go into detail about any of the accounting matters but
worried out loud about the "run on the bank" that had seemed to bring the
company down nearly overnight.</TE>
<TE>   "My sense of Cliff is he would really be bothered if he thought people
felt badly of him," Buckner said. "To some people it's like water off a
duck's back, but not Cliff. I'm absolutely shocked. It's a tragedy. We're
all so sorry that he felt he needed to do this."</TE>
<TE>   Buckner described Baxter as a conscientious family man who joined the
club to provide activities for children, a boy of high school age named
J.C. and a preteen girl named Lauren. Baxter recently warned Buckner that
all members should learn how to radio for medical help, after he heard a
woman on another boat calling for help for her sick husband.</TE>
<TE>   He had also expressed his desire to take longer trips with his family
in the cabin cruiser.</TE>
<TE>   Former colleague Michael P. Moran, once general counsel for Enron's
gas pipeline group, said he was "saddened and shocked."</TE>
<TE>   "As long as I've known Cliff, I never knew him to be a person who was
depressed, who would bring it to taking his own life," Moran said. "He
was an idea guy in very substantial jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Concerned that other Enron employees, both high and low, might be
considering the suicide route, the Houston Crisis Intervention Center
opened a telephone hotline with counselors.</TE>
<TE>   At the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church in a small park directly
across the street from Enron, U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Houston)
and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, in town to take up the cause of the Enron
employees, asked local ministers to keep their church doors open over the
weekend to counsel people.</TE>
<TE>   "Do not dive into the isolation of death and suicide. Anyone who is
distraught or feeling in need, do not feel alone," Lee told the audience
made up of local religious leaders and a few Enron workers.</TE>

<HD>Arafat Helping Foster Terror, Bush Declares</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Saying he is 'very, very disappointed' in the Palestinian
leader, the president all but accuses him of a direct role in arms
smuggling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Maine
</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Friday all but accused Yasser Arafat of direct
involvement in arms smuggling, saying that he was "very, very
disappointed" in the Palestinian Authority president.</LD>
<LD>   Arafat "must make a full effort to rout out terror in the Middle
East," Bush said. "And ordering up weapons that were intercepted on a
boat headed . . . for that part of the world is not part of fighting
terror. That's enhancing terror."</LD>
<LD>   Fifty tons of weapons were discovered on a ship intercepted by Israeli
commandos in the Red Sea this month. Israel has said that the ship was
owned by the Palestinian Authority and that several crew members were
officers in the Palestinian naval police force.</LD>
<TE>   Bush's words marked the lowest point in U.S.-Palestinian relations
since at least 1993, experts said. U.S. officials have previously cited
evidence that the arms shipment was ordered by the Palestinian Authority,
which Arafat heads, but they stopped short of accusing Arafat of a role.</TE>
<TE>   In a private session at the White House on Friday, Bush and his
national security team discussed options, including closing the
Palestinian Authority office in Washington and placing Arafat's personal
security force on the State Department's list of terrorist groups, aides
said. But they said Bush made no immediate decision on which course to
take.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and his aides did agree, however, that there was no purpose in
sending retired Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, Bush's emissary to the Mideast,
back to the region.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the closest the president has come to saying Arafat is
directly implicated, and that's important," said Shibley Telhami, a
Middle East expert at the University of Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Bush's actions have fallen short of what some inside and
outside the administration have been demanding. One official predicted
that Washington will take actions to underscore its displeasure but won't
cut ties.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said on the PBS program "NewsHour
With Jim Lehrer" that the "moment of truth" had come for Arafat and
expressed his disappointment that the Palestinian leader had not accepted
responsibility for the arms shipment.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials' unhappiness with Arafat has increased as violence
swelled in recent months. But their confidence in Arafat has been gravely
damaged by his handling of the arms incident, aides said.</TE>
<TE>   Washington alleges that Arafat lied about his government's role in the
operation of the ship Karine-A, intercepted Jan. 3 with rockets, mortars
and other weapons on board.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have been trying to pressure Arafat to suppress
terrorist activities. Officials say that whatever steps they take against
Arafat, they will insist that he take action against Palestinian
militants before the United States resumes any role as a mediator between
the Palestinians and Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Walker, a former assistant secretary of State for Near East
affairs, noted that the smuggling violates an agreement signed by
Palestinian officials. U.S. officials' frustration with Arafat is now
"enormous," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Walker said he believes that breaking off ties would be a
mistake because it would allow opponents of the peace effort to achieve
three important goals: It would remove Arafat from a key role, would end
U.S. mediation and would foreclose hope for an agreement.</TE>
<TE>   In Ramallah, the West Bank city where Israeli soldiers have Arafat
under virtual house arrest, a senior Arafat advisor said severing ties
would "cause an earthquake."</TE>
<TE>   The advisor, Nabil abu Rudaineh, said Bush should act instead against
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon "and not receive him in the White
House."</TE>
<TE>   For their part, Israeli government officials expressed satisfaction
Friday with the Bush administration's expressions of understanding for
Israel's increased pressure on Arafat. Israel has confined Arafat to
Ramallah for nearly two months and has said it will keep him there until
he arrests the killers of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi, who was
gunned down in an East Jerusalem hotel in October. It is stepping up
raids into Palestinian-controlled territories, incursions into
Palestinian cities and the destruction of Arafat's symbols of power.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli government confirmed Friday that Sharon has been invited
to visit Bush at the White House on Feb. 7 to coordinate U.S. and Israeli
policy toward the Palestinian Authority.</TE>

<HD>A Second Chance at Life, Gold</HD>
<DH>A grieving family's decision to donate their son's organs saved
Olympic snowboarder Chris Klug from a deadly liver disease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ASPEN, Colo.
</DL>
<LD>This is Chris Klug's life now. There is snowboarding most mornings,
followed by a late lunch at places only the locals know about, like
Johnny McGuire's, where Klug is partial to the "trucker," a concoction of
turkey, bacon, cheddar, mayo and barbecue sauce stuffed in a helpless
roll.</LD>
<LD>   There also is time to hang out with his buddies and his longtime
girlfriend, with his family and her family. There is time to quietly muse
about the gift of a second chance.</LD>
<LD>   Eighteen months ago, Klug was near death, suffering from the same
disease that months earlier had killed Walter Payton, the great Chicago
Bears running back. Without a transplant, the champion snowboard racer,
who finished sixth in the 1998 Nagano Olympics, had just months to live.</LD>
<TE>   Then a tragedy occurred outside Denver. A 13-year-old boy was
accidentally shot in the head by a 14-year-old neighbor. His parents, in
an act of courage and grace, agreed to donate his organs.</TE>
<TE>   The liver went to Chris Klug. The liver took. Now Klug is strong
again, 29, 6 feet, 3 inches, 215 pounds, full of life. He qualified this
week for the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, where he has as good a
chance as anyone to win gold in the parallel giant slalom snowboard race.</TE>
<TE>   He wants to win for himself, of course, because he is a competitive
soul. He believes an American ought to win in what is essentially an
American-born sport, particularly at a Games held in the U.S. And he
wants to show the world that snowboarders are real athletes.</TE>
<TE>   A gold medal would bring the cameras, and he would be in the spotlight
long enough to ask everyone: "Do you have a donor card in your wallet?"</TE>
<TE>   Klug spent three years on a transplant waiting list. The last three
months, he knew his liver was in failure, starting the moment he felt
like a "dagger had been jammed into my right side and turned."</TE>
<TE>   In all, the disease occupied seven years of his life. It left him with
a scar that runs from his chest, down at an angle, almost to his right
hip.</TE>
<TE>   Called primary sclerosing cholangitis, or PSC, the disease affects
about 3 in every 100,000 people, mostly young men. The liver's bile ducts
become scarred and then blocked. The cause is unknown. A transplant is
the only cure.</TE>
<TE>   Klug was in his early 20s when he was diagnosed after a routine
physical exam after he and his family moved from Bend, Ore., where Klug
grew up, to Aspen, where his mom is a schoolteacher and his dad runs a
hotel a block from the lifts on famed Aspen Mountain. Abnormal blood test
results raised suspicions.</TE>
<TE>   "I was feeling great, I was winning World Cup races, I was doing
great," Klug said. "I was like, 'You sure you got the right guy? This
doesn't make any sense.' "</TE>
<TE>   Liver disease was for alcoholics or drug addicts, right? This was the
all-American boy, the high school quarterback turned world-class
snowboarder, good looking, well spoken, thoughtful--such a natural that
he's featured in a lengthy made-by-NBC movie trailer promoting the
Olympics.</TE>
<TE>Devotion to Sport Began at Young Age</TE>
<TE>   "He's got the brains and the brawn and the fortitude and the
dedication," said Pat April, mother of Klug's longtime girlfriend, Missy.</TE>
<TE>   That dedication was evident as far back as high school. It wasn't
enough for Klug--at 15, already a snowboarding standout--to get to the
slopes only on weekends and holidays. After school, he would drive 40
miles each way to a ski site near Sisters, Ore., with lighted slopes and
barrel down the hill well into the night.</TE>
<TE>   There is a picture of Klug at age 11, standing in front of the family
Christmas tree with his first snowboard, a red one.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, back in the 1980s, when snowboards still had holes near the
nose--so riders could thread a rope and lug the thing up the hill--Klug
knew he was onto something big: Snowboarding's growth has far eclipsed
traditional skiing in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Klug's drive was fired by the Olympics. As a boy he watched Eric
Heiden win five gold medals in speed skating at the Lake Placid Games in
1980, and Bill Johnson win the downhill in Sarajevo in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Then in 1998 he was there in Nagano, the first Games in which
snowboarding was in the Olympic program.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone would always talk about that feeling of walking into the
opening ceremony," Klug said. "You can't grasp it until you do it. It's
magical."</TE>
<TE>   At those Olympics, only family and close friends knew of Klug's
condition. He already had been on a transplant waiting list for a year,
and he was regularly undergoing procedures to unclog some liver ducts,
what he now refers to as "roto-rooter treatments." But no one meeting him
would have known he was suffering from a deadly disease. His skin, for
instance, was not a telltale yellow.</TE>
<TE>   The men's giant slalom race in Nagano was the first snowboard event in
Olympic history, featuring races running through a series of gates, just
as in a traditional ski race, with one difference. Snowboarders are
anchored to a single board.</TE>
<TE>   Klug was tied for second after the first run; on the second, however,
his hand hit a gate, throwing him off just slightly. Canadian Ross
Rebagliati won the race.</TE>
<TE>   "I was obviously frustrated," he recalls, referring to his sixth-place
finish. "But at the same time I was super-stoked to be at the Olympics."
Snowboarding, it seemed, had successfully made its mark. The snowboarders
had proved wrong the naysayers who thought little of them as athletes and
even less of the tricks they performed.</TE>
<TE>   Then, three days after the race, the International Olympic Committee
announced it intended to strip Rebagliati of the medal because he had
tested positive for marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Rebagliati blamed secondhand smoke at a party a few weeks before. He
was allowed to keep his medal when an arbitration panel ruled there were
no legal grounds for punishment. But the grass-on-snow jokes had made the
rounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a great event, and then right after the event the focus
switched from the focus of our first Olympics to this pot-smoking
fiasco," Klug said.</TE>
<TE>   In many quarters, it all served to reinforce a perception that
lingers, like wispy smoke, that snowboarders aren't to be taken
seriously.</TE>
<TE>Payton's Death Hit Him Hard</TE>
<TE>   Klug demurs, saying that snowboarders are athletes every bit the
caliber of World Cup skiers.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some amazing athletes on the snowboarding circuit," he
said. "They train hard. They work hard to prepare for their events, and
work hard to try to win. That's often misunderstood."</TE>
<TE>   In Klug's case, that was evident after a freak accident in 1998 while
doing gymnastics training. He tore three of the four major ligaments that
support the right knee joint.</TE>
<TE>   It took a full year of rehab, under the direction of Bill Fabrocini,
director of the sports performance center at the Aspen Club, to get the
knee back in shape.</TE>
<TE>   "When he's in the gym, he works hard," said Fabrocini, who has since
become one of Klug's closest friends. "He wants to win. He always wants
to get the edge on any competitor. He doesn't want any variable."</TE>
<TE>   Just when the knee was back in shape, Klug suffered an emotional blow.
In November 1999, he was alone in a rental car on a lonely road in Utah,
en route to a U.S. snowboarding camp, when he heard on National Public
Radio that Payton had died.</TE>
<TE>   "I almost drove off the road when I heard the news," Klug said.
"Walter Payton was one of the strongest athletes ever. If he could die
from it, I could die from it."</TE>
<TE>   That season, Klug won a number of races, including a World Cup event
in Germany. But off the slopes, his condition worsened. His doctors, who
were seeing him every six months, now wanted to see him every two.</TE>
<TE>'You're Going to Need a New Liver'</TE>
<TE>   Klug did his best to live a normal active lifestyle but privately
struggled with fear.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time I'd get a cold, just something basic that was wrong with me
that any normal person deals with, the flu or a cold or a stomachache,
I'd think the world was coming to an end: 'Oh my God, my liver's
failing,' "</TE>
<TE>   In April 2000, Klug was in Southern California, surfing. One day it
was Malibu, the next day Huntington Beach, six to eight hours a day in
the water. It was then he felt the stabbing pain, the dagger turned in
his side.</TE>
<TE>   "I was up that entire night, just kind of thinking to myself, 'OK,
you're going to get a new liver. You're going to need a new liver,' " he
said. "I knew, right then."</TE>
<TE>   The next day, he flew back to Colorado. Doctors gave him a beeper,
told him not to go anywhere without it. A beep would alert him that a
donor had been found and a transplant would begin almost immediately.
Doctors told him to expect to wait about two months before surgery. But,
they hastened to add, no guarantees.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than one-half of 1% of the people who die each year opt to
donate their organs to help others. In 2000, transplanted organs--livers,
kidneys, hearts, lungs--were harvested from only 5,985 cadavers.</TE>
<TE>   Many transplant candidates do not survive the wait; 1,686 died while
waiting for a liver that year, said Anne Paschke, a spokeswoman for
United Network for Organ Sharing, which maintains the federal organ
donation list.</TE>
<TE>   In Aspen, two months passed without a beep. Then three months.</TE>
<TE>   Klug recalled the waiting as "the hardest time of the whole transplant
deal."</TE>
<TE>   "Each day and each week, you're getting weaker and weaker. You
couldn't do the things that you were doing last week."</TE>
<TE>   As May slid into June, he said, "I was mountain-biking up Buttermilk
or up Tiehack, doing my favorite rides, I'm smothering the mountain here,
and the next week I couldn't do it. Or I'd do it and have to stop."</TE>
<TE>   Then, as the calendar turned to July and his strength kept waning, "I
didn't give a damn about the snowboarding. I was just hoping I was going
to live."</TE>
<TE>   On July 27, he was beeped.</TE>
<TE>   Two nights earlier, the 13-year-old boy had been shot. After he was
declared brain-dead, his grief-stricken parents were asked by doctors to
donate his organs.</TE>
<TE>   "You just have to wonder what goodness touches people's hearts at the
time that just allows them to say yes," said Klug's mother, Kathy. "You
can't even think through that kind of pain while your child is lying
there, and you say yes to this. I'm so impressed by that kind of
courage."</TE>
<TE>   The transplant was performed a day later at University of Colorado
Hospital in Denver. The surgery took more than six hours.</TE>
<TE>   "I came into the room for the first time after surgery, and he just
leans over and puts his hands in the air and says, 'I rule!' " Klug's
girlfriend, Missy April, recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The average hospital stay for a liver transplant patient is 12 days.
Klug was out in four. Back in Aspen, Fabrocini put Klug through two "slow
months" of rehab. The next two, however, were "full force," and by fall
he was pronounced ready for snowboarding. "I was amazed at how easy [the
recovery] was," Fabrocini says, easier than reconditioning the knee.</TE>
<TE>   About six months after the surgery, Klug wrote the donor family
expressing his gratitude. The day after writing the note, he won a World
Cup event in Italy. Later, he finished second in another World Cup event
in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly don't take a single day or a single thing for granted
anymore," said Klug, who takes medication to prevent his body from
rejecting the transplant but whose prognosis is excellent.</TE>
<TE>   Klug has never met the donor family. But they will be among those
watching the Olympics on TV, rooting for him.</TE>
<TE>   When Klug's letter arrived, "It made all of us cry," said the boy's
mother, Leisa Flood, 35, who now lives in Idaho. Referring to the
decision to donate her son Billy's organs, she said, "The hardest thing I
ever did is when I walked out of that room knowing they were taking him
down to surgery."</TE>
<TE>   The boy's father, Rob Flood, 41, who lives in Northern California,
said the experience was agonizing. But Flood said he has "no doubts" the
right thing was done: "I thought if we could save some other family from
going through what we were going through, it was worth it."</TE>
<TE>   A few days ago, he dug up Klug's note, which had been sitting in a box
for most of the last year, and reread it, slowly, out loud.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Donor Family,</TE>
<TE>   I am over in Europe doing my favorite thing in the world,
snowboarding. I thank God every day I'm back on the mountain and I thank
you every day for your gift of life. You have given me a second chance to
pursue my dreams and to enjoy life to its fullest. None of this would
have been possible without you.</TE>
<TE>   I love my family and I love my girlfriend very much. They are as
thankful and as grateful for your gift as I. Your choice has enabled me
to continue the life I love. I am forever grateful and humbled by your
decision. I am truly sorry for your loss.</TE>
<TE>   It is impossible to express with words my gratitude to you. I hope
through my efforts I can spread the good news on my successful transplant
and someday save someone else's life. I am forever indebted to you.</TE>
<TE>   Sincerely, Chris</TE>
<TE>   Rob Flood folded the paper, sighed and said, "You know, Billy always
wanted to go snowboarding and never had the opportunity."</TE>

<HD>Media Missed Clues to Enron's Troubles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SHAW</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Fortune magazine survey called it the most innovative company in
the country--for six straight years. The New York Times said it was "a
model for the new American workplace." The Dallas Morning News described
it as "one of the most envied and respected corporations in the United
States." Business Week looked at one of its pioneering ventures and said,
"The risk is remarkably small."</LD>
<LD>   That "low-risk" broadband venture by Enron Corp., the billion-dollar,
Houston-based energy trader, wound up with a $102-million operating loss
in the second quarter last year and was but a prelude to a complete
corporate collapse, the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history.</LD>
<LD>   For the most part, until the Enron collapse was well underway, the
nation's news media--including the presumably sophisticated financial
outlets--missed a number of early warning signs and failed to alert the
public to the company's potentially precarious situation.</LD>
<TE>   "When something this big comes as this much of a shock, it suggests
that something has been very wrong with the journalism," says Robert
Lichter, co-director of the Washington-based Center for Media and Public
Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   John Olson, an investment analyst in Houston, was one of the few in
his field--and in his city--who was not on the Enron bandwagon. He says
there were "signposts out there for people to see, but the company kept
giving the media head-fakes and playing hardball."</TE>
<TE>   Olson, of the Sanders Morris Harris Group, says a number of former
Enron employees and associates repeatedly warned him to "be careful. . .
. The numbers aren't what they seem to be."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Chanos, president of Kynikos Associates in New York, began issuing
similar warnings in the fall of 2000 after reading a column in the
regional Texas edition of the Wall Street Journal warning that the
extraordinarily high price/earnings ratio for Enron and two other Houston
energy companies suggested that "investors . . . could be in for a jolt
down the road."</TE>
<TE>   That column prompted Chanos to do his own research and to start
selling short on the stock--in effect, betting it would decline--and to
talk to two other journalists who wrote relatively brief, early stories
raising questions about the company.</TE>
<TE>Media Ignored the Red Flags</TE>
<TE>   The warning signs? There was a major, longtime discrepancy between
Enron's profits and its cash flow. Its return on investment also was
remarkably low for such a high-risk venture. Its financial statements
were incomprehensible. Its top executives repeatedly were selling huge
quantities of the company's stock. A surprisingly large number of senior
executives were leaving--68 of them over an 18-month span.</TE>
<TE>   All these red flags, many financial experts and journalists now say,
should have triggered intense media scrutiny. Instead, says the New York
Post's Christopher Byron--a longtime financial writer who's worked for
Forbes, New York magazine, Esquire and the New York Observer--"too much
of the media were part of the cheerleading squad for Enron."</TE>
<TE>   Did Byron take a hard, early look at Enron?</TE>
<TE>   No.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in New York and I saw Enron as just an out-of-town energy trading
company--obviously a . . . mistake in judgment on my part," he now
concedes, echoing comments made by many other journalists.</TE>
<TE>   Why did most of the national media--and the home-state Texas media,
for that matter--miss the Enron story?</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was in part a product of the bull market of the '90s,"
says Jim Michaels, whose tenure as editor of Forbes magazine from 1961 to
1998 featured many aggressive investigative stories on just such go-go
companies as Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was investing in the market, and the market was going up and
up, and people didn't want to hear bad news," Michaels says. "I think
there's been too much emphasis in recent years on these great success
miracle stories, and too many reporters have gotten away from doing the
hard, slogging reporting--looking at the footnotes in disclosure
documents, wading through the dry-as-dust numbers and asking the tough
questions about them that would have cast a great deal of doubt on the
Enron 'miracle.' "</TE>
<TE>   But the media's failure concerning the Enron story was "part of a
total failure by everyone, a complete breakdown in the system, in all the
checks and balances," says Frank Lalli, editor of Money magazine from
1989 to 1998. "It was a failure by the Wall Street analysts who just went
along for the ride, and by the auditors who were collecting so much money
they couldn't walk away from it, and by the government agencies who are
supposed to monitor these companies."</TE>
<TE>Relying on the Analysts</TE>
<TE>   Like investors, many financial reporters rely heavily on stock
analysts. But analysts often have an inherent conflict of interest.
Companies such as Enron have considerable leverage over them, saying
(implicitly, if not explicitly), "We support the analysts who support our
stock," meaning they'll give their lucrative investment banking business
to those firms whose analysts issue strong "buy" recommendations for
their stock.</TE>
<TE>   That's why analysts get paid so much, says Gordon Howald, an energy
analyst for Credit Lyonnais. "It's not because they write nice reports
with glossy covers. It's because they help generate fees for their firms
by taking a very, very optimistic view of a stock, even if they don't
necessarily believe it."</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 24, more than a week after Enron admitted a $618-million
quarterly loss and a $1.2-billion drop in equity, 13 of the 16 analysts
who rated Enron still recommended that investors buy the stock and only
one recommended selling.</TE>
<TE>   Some reporters did ask tough questions of Enron and its analysts, and
some did study disclosure statements and other documents, "but when the
guys running the company are telling flat-out lies to you . . . and when
the filings are fraudulent," Lalli says, "I think it's a tall order for
somebody to expect the press to come in and take this very complicated
company apart.</TE>
<TE>   "The press doesn't have subpoena power, and without that, the only way
you can do the story is if you have someone on the inside, a
whistle-blower who can tell you what happened and walk you through it."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, that's what helped the Wall Street Journal "blow the story
open," in the words of Joseph Nocera, executive editor of Fortune.</TE>
<TE>   The Journal came relatively late to the story too, though. Enron was
formed in 1985 and was a billion-dollar company by the end of the 1990s.
Except for that one skeptical Texas column in September 2000, the paper
didn't begin to thoroughly examine Enron's business practices in print
until the last five months of last year. By then, Enron had been a
highflier and a fast faller, with its stock price at less than half its
peak.</TE>
<TE>   "You can always say you should have done more, sooner," says Paul
Steiger, managing editor of the Journal. But when a company's lawyers and
accountants are playing hiding games with their Securities and Exchange
Commission disclosures, "it's very hard to crack," Steiger says.</TE>
<TE>   Once the paper's reporters began looking hard at Enron, "the Journal
lapped the field," says Michael Hiltzik, a veteran business reporter at
the Los Angeles Times.</TE>
<TE>   The Journal's breakthrough did not begin with a whistle-blower but
with a resignation.</TE>
<TE>   To Rebecca Smith, who covers the energy industry for the Journal, the
resignation in August of Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling was "the
point of no return."</TE>
<TE>   She and several Journal colleagues had long been uneasy about Enron's
rapid growth, high stock price, opaque accounting procedures and
swaggering leadership. But when Skilling suddenly announced he was
resigning for "personal reasons" just six months after taking the job he
had coveted for years, Smith decided, "Something clearly was going on.</TE>
<TE>   "His quitting made absolutely no sense, and we know that when we say
that," she added, "it really means that it does make sense but we just
don't know enough yet to figure it out.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when I started to look seriously at Enron's 'black box'
accounting."</TE>
<TE>Wondering Where the Money Comes From</TE>
<TE>   Many other journalists also had long been dubious about Enron's
meteoric rise. A few--very few--had even written about their concerns.
Five months before Skilling's departure, for example, Bethany McLean
wrote a story for Fortune magazine headlined "Is Enron Overpriced?" The
story asked bluntly, "How exactly does Enron make its money?" and it
essentially concluded that no one--not Wall Street analysts, not
investors, not journalists--really knew because the company's business
practices were "largely impenetrable . . . mind-numbingly complex . . .
deeply frustrating . . . mysterious."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty sophisticated," says Newsweek's Allan Sloan, who has long
specialized in writing business stories that slice through the
gobbledygook of balance sheets, "but I don't think I would have seen what
was wrong with their numbers unless someone hit me over the head and
pointed it out it to me."</TE>
<TE>   Not only were the company's financial statements opaque, but Skilling,
former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, and founder and Chairman
Kenneth L. Lay--who resigned this week--all were notorious for
stonewalling or giving misleading answers to reporters' questions.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling called McLean unethical and hung up when she questioned him,
and Lay and Fastow tried to persuade her editors that the company had no
problems. Nocera, the Fortune editor, says he was "in the room when
McLean asked Fastow point-blank" about two of the company's subsidiary
partnerships that later became controversial, "and he said he couldn't
talk about that for 'competitive reasons.'</TE>
<TE>   "It was a non-answer, given with a smile. And that was as far as he
was going to go, and it was as far as we could go at that time."</TE>
<TE>   Other journalists had the same experience when Skilling resigned. He
and Lay would not go beyond citing "personal reasons." (Skilling did
subsequently concede that the sharp decline in Enron's stock price, from
a high of $90 in August 2000 to $42.15 the day before he quit, played a
significant role in his decision.)</TE>
<TE>   "We felt that unless he was really sick . . . there was something
fishy, and we did some reporting and we talked to both of them, on and
off the record . . . but we couldn't get any more," says Steve Shepard,
editor in chief of Business Week magazine.</TE>
<TE>   James Cramer, co-host of CNBC's "America Now," wrote in his column at
http://www.thestreet.com on the day Skilling left: "If Enron isn't
disclosing what the reasons for the resignation are, we have to presume
that it is something so horrendous and horrible that we can't own the
stock. I know I won't touch it."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Eavis, senior columnist for the Web site, had raised questions
about Enron's financial status three months before Skilling quit and
again a month before he resigned.</TE>
<TE>   Most critics of the media say that if other reporters weren't already
alerted to potential problems at Enron, they certainly should have put on
their gumshoes after Skilling left.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the architect of all their major strategies, and we should
have been a lot more vigilant when he left so soon," Shepard says. The
editors of the two biggest newspapers in Texas, the Dallas Morning News
and Enron's hometown Houston Chronicle, say they, in particular, should
have pursued the Enron story much more aggressively.</TE>
<TE>   But less than a month after Skilling's resignation, terrorists
attacked the United States, and that story quickly seized the
attention--and the resources--of most news organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street Journal is primarily a business newspaper, though, and
while its staff devoted enormous time and effort to the terrorist attacks
on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Journal reporters vigorously
pursued Enron too.</TE>
<TE>   Smith and John Emshwiller, a respected investigative reporter at the
Journal, began digging. Two months later, when Enron reported a
$1.01-billion after-tax charge, resulting in the $618-million
third-quarter loss, Smith and Emshwiller already had in their possession
internal Enron documents concerning limited partnerships that had been
run by the company's chief financial officer. That, they wrote in the
next day's paper, "raises anew vexing conflict-of-interest questions."</TE>
<TE>   The day their story ran, Enron stock dropped 10%, to $32 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Most other mainstream news media did not immediately follow up on
either the Enron disclosures or the Journal story. The Los Angeles Times,
for example, which had aggressively covered the controversies surrounding
Enron during California's energy crisis earlier last year, didn't publish
a story on Enron's third-quarter loss until two days after it was
reported, and even then gave it only four sentences as the second item in
a markets roundup.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times, widely regarded as having the best business
section of any general-interest newspaper, wound up crediting the Journal
when it began to accelerate its own Enron coverage last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Smith and Emshwiller continued to report and to write and to push
Enron executives to say more than they customarily had--and Enron's stock
price continued to drop. It fell for 10 straight days, closing at
$11.16--a plunge of 65%--before rallying briefly and then nose-diving
into oblivion; it was 26 cents a share Dec. 2, when the company filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   Even that cataclysmic event--the collapse of the seventh-largest
company in the country in an already shaky economy--wasn't big news in
most of the mainstream media. It merited only two sentences on the ABC,
CBS and NBC evening news shows and didn't make Page 1 in the Washington
Post, Boston Globe, Philadelphia Inquirer, USA Today, Denver Post or
Detroit Free Press, among many others. (It did make Page 1 of the New
York Times, Los Angeles Times, Dallas Morning News and Houston Chronicle,
though, among others.)</TE>
<TE>   The financial press jumped on the bankruptcy story, but it wasn't
until early this year that Enron became a Page 1 story. The widespread
coverage began after Enron's accounting firm, Andersen, admitted
destroying documents and it was revealed that the company had more than
3,500 partnerships, several hundred of them in offshore operations. The
federal government began investigating, Enron insiders began talking,
internal documents began leaking and most of the mainstream media picked
up on the story as a political scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "Journalists love politics, and they tend to see the world in terms of
politics," says Lichter of the Center for Media and Public Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, several major newspapers--the Wall Street Journal, New York
Times, Los Angeles Times and Washington Post--printed stories about
Enron's contributions to, influence on and/or connections with the Bush
administration long before the company's financial problems became news.</TE>
<TE>   "Major newspapers are just not going to devote the resources to a
business scandal that they'll devote to a political scandal," Fortune's
Nocera says.</TE>

<HD>UCLA Buys Sontag's Archive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIMI AVINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The UCLA Library has purchased the literary archive of Susan
Sontag, one of the best-known and most influential American intellectuals
of the late 20th century.</LD>
<LD>   Sources close to the sale say the library paid $1.1 million for her
personal papers, letters and manuscripts and library. Funds were donated
by an anonymous UCLA alumna.</LD>
<LD>   Sontag, 69, was raised in Tucson and Los Angeles but has lived in New
York more than four decades. She said her first choice for placement of
her archive would have been the New York Public Library, but added that
"It is a source of great pleasure to me that it is going to a place I had
a connection with. Southern California has been part of my life."</LD>
<TE>   The archive, which will come to UCLA next month, arrives at a time of
increasing competition among American university libraries for literary
collections. Throughout the 1970s, prices for papers of well-established
authors were relatively low, ranging from $25,000 to $75,000. By 1997,
the archive of Ted Hughes, Britain's poet laureate, had been acquired by
Emory University in Atlanta for about $600,000, and in 1994 Stanford
University paid a reported $980,000 for poet Allen Ginsberg's extensive
manuscripts, one of the largest amounts garnered by an archive of a
then-living author.</TE>
<TE>   Sontag is best known for her provocative essays on subjects ranging
from her own experience with cancer to an analysis of the art of
photography, as well as for her novels. She won the National Book Award
for fiction in 2000 for "In America" and received the Jerusalem Prize in
2001 for her body of work, an honor given at the Jerusalem International
Book Fair and considered second only to the Nobel Prize in literary
prestige.</TE>
<TE>   "Against Interpretation," her first collection of essays, published in
1966, is considered a modern classic for its discussions of the arts and
contemporary culture.</TE>
<TE>   Sontag has been a human rights activist for 30 years, and served from
1987 to 1989 as president of the American Center of PEN, the
international writers organization dedicated to freedom of expression and
the advancement of literature.</TE>
<TE>   A brief essay in the New Yorker magazine immediately after the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks created the biggest controversy of her career. In
it, she savaged political leaders and media pundits for characterizing
America's enemies as cowards. She has since said she was stunned by the
vitriolic response, which included editorials calling her a traitor and
American-basher.</TE>
<TE>   "Susan Sontag is a phenomenally versatile writer, a wide-ranging
thinker and committed activist," said Victoria Steele, head of the UCLA
department of special collections. "Her papers will appeal to scholars
interested in everything from art history to literature, women's studies
and the history of medicine."</TE>
<TE>   David Zeidberg, director of the Huntington Library in San Marino,
said, "If her papers have commandeered a seven-figure price, it's because
they were worth it."</TE>
<TE>   Sontag's correspondence includes 2,500 letters to and from such
notable literary figures as essayist Jacques Derrida, poet Czeslaw
Milosz, novelists Larry McMurtry and Philip Roth, as well as documents
from her campaign as PEN president on behalf of Salman Rushdie, who was
targeted in 1989 with a death threat by the Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran.</TE>
<TE>   She has stipulated that some of the letters may not be read until 25
years after her death, according to Steele. The archive also includes
drafts of Sontag's four novels, "The Benefactor," "Death Kit," "The
Volcano Lover" and "In America"; her collection of short stories; and
seven works of nonfiction, notably "On Photography" and "Illness as
Metaphor."</TE>
<TE>   There are also film scripts, production notes, still photographs and
other materials that document the creation of the four foreign art films
Sontag wrote and directed that were released between 1969 and 1983.
Diaries and notebooks are among the 89 handwritten workbooks in the
collection, dating from 1948. Her personal library of 20,000 volumes of
literature, history, art and the social sciences, valued at $440,000, is
part of the sale to UCLA as well. The materials include copies of her
work in the 28 languages into which it's been translated.</TE>
<TE>   Sontag said financial considerations and a lack of storage space
motivated the sale. "I have only my apartment in New York, and I've saved
a lot of stuff, so I have a Manhattanite's space problem," she said. "If
I had a huge attic or cellar, I'm sure there would be less incentive to
disburden. Money isn't the main consideration, but I go through long
periods when I don't make any money. This is something that will support
me for a couple of years."</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, she received a MacArthur Foundation grant of $340,000, paid
out over five years, which she says relieved financial pressure during
that period.</TE>
<TE>   In her more than 40-year career, Sontag has been politically
outspoken, offending both the left and right. In the 1980s, she described
communism as "fascism with a human face" and in the 1990s was outspokenly
critical of the U.S.-led bombing campaign against Serbia.</TE>
<TE>   She was diagnosed with breast cancer in her early 40s, and while
undergoing treatment wrote "Illness as Metaphor," examining the ways
society projects its fear of disease by attaching dark meanings to it.
Five years ago uterine cancer was discovered, but her health is currently
said to be good, and she has been active on the lecture circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Andreas Brown, owner of the Gotham Book Mart and a leading archival
consultant, said acquiring the papers of living authors has become more
common in the 30 years since a change in tax laws removed the incentive
for estates to donate archives.</TE>
<TE>   "Norman Mailer is asking $2.5 million for his archive. That's absurd,"
Brown said. "There are only two 20th century authors who would be in that
ballpark, J.D. Salinger and Thomas Pynchon, because of the mystique they
have."</TE>
<TE>   The University of Texas has long been the foremost collector in the
field, but the Huntington Library is actively collecting 20th century
writers. Emory University has concentrated on Irish literature.</TE>
<TE>   Brown called the Sontag acquisition "quite a coup for UCLA."</TE>
<TE>   Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist McMurtry said: "Most authors sell
their archives as an additional source of income. I sell my papers every
year. I'd never give a university a page. Almost any school can find an
angel at the level of $25,000 to $75,000 for two to five years'
worth--three drafts of a novel, all the drafts you produce writing a
screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   "It becomes a harder sell when the price goes up to seven figures," he
said. "Susan Sontag has worked for a long time, at a high level, in a
great number of disciplines, which made her archive significant."</TE>
<TE>   Sontag says she has given right of first review to UCLA for future
papers and does not want the sale to be seen as a sign of her retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "I have the most profoundly American temperamental conviction that the
future still holds new things for me," she said. "Selling the archive is
not, 'Now it's all over, and I'm packing up and getting ready to think
about my estate.' I don't feel this is one of the gestures that one
performs toward the end of one's life."</TE>

<HD>Harrowing 911 Calls Point to a Pitiless Moscow</HD>
<DH>Russia: Transcript reveals a desperate young man, trapped in a
truck pulverizing trash, pleading for help but meeting skepticism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>The young man was intoxicated but on his feet when he left a
billiards hall early Jan. 9. But he later awoke to find himself tumbling
inside a moving garbage truck, dodging massive blades slowly grinding
collected refuse into pulp.</LD>
<LD>   For 23 minutes, according to a transcript of a series of calls made on
his cell phone to Moscow's 911 rescue service operators, 25-year-old
Taras Shugayev pleaded and cried, saying he was being squeezed and
begging for help.</LD>
<LD>   But the operators only advised him to alert the driver by banging from
inside the truck, and no discernible action was taken by Moscow's various
police forces--which, according to one rescue service spokesman,
dismissed the report as a prank.</LD>
<TE>   "Are you in a joking mood to be calling us like this at 6 o'clock in
the morning?" a police dispatcher reportedly said.</TE>
<TE>   By his fourth call, during which the rescue service appeared focused
mainly on trying to learn who might have put him into the truck, Shugayev
was desperate.</TE>
<TE>   "This is it, I think, I am suffocating. This is it," were the last
words recorded.</TE>
<TE>   Police didn't respond until more than 24 hours later, when the man was
reported missing by his family. They retrieved his phone records
and--with the help of the rescue service recordings--pieced together what
might have happened. Now, in a grisly denouement to the drama, they are
sifting through a suburban dump, looking for possible remains.</TE>
<TE>   Shugayev's case, which came to public notice in Moscow newspapers this
week, has sparked a criminal investigation and thrown an uncomfortable
spotlight on the callous indifference that can mark everyday life in this
often harsh city of 9 million people.</TE>
<TE>   Was Shugayev stuffed into a garbage bin by muggers who regularly prey
on drunks? Did some acquaintance throw him into a garbage truck as a
practical joke? Were the people at the other end of the line too jaded,
busy or tired to respond to the possibility that a life was in danger?</TE>
<TE>Father Is Shaken, Mother Still Hopeful</TE>
<TE>   "I simply don't know who to blame," Shugayev's shaken father, Boris,
said Friday. Meanwhile, the young man's mother, Raisa, still clung to the
hope that her 6-foot-2 son would come strolling through her door.</TE>
<TE>   "I am sitting here--waiting for him to call and say: 'Mom, it's me.
I'm OK!' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   "This horrendous story demonstrates once again that life is stranger
than fiction, especially in Russia," said police expert and crime-fiction
writer Marina Alexeyeva, who uses the pen name Alexandra Marinina. "Only
in Russia could they hire complete lunatics and plain idiots to work in
such a critically responsible agency as the rescue service, just because
they pay their operators peanuts.</TE>
<TE>   "The man is dying. He is calling the only people who can and should
save him, and in return he is bombarded with the most stupid and
immediately irrelevant questions--like who put him there and how can they
get in touch with them."</TE>
<TE>   Natalia Kochergina, a spokeswoman for the rescue service, said the
investigation was continuing but asserted that her records show that the
operators involved notified police within three minutes, as required. A
Central Moscow traffic police spokesman disputed that account, saying the
police have no log entry showing they were ever alerted.</TE>
<TE>   "All the necessary phone calls were made. There is no doubt about it,"
Kochergina insisted. "The problem is that at 6 a.m., the police simply
treated this report as a joke."</TE>
<TE>   Of 15,000 calls each day to Moscow's 911, most are not real
emergencies, and between 200 and 300 are pranks, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Shugayev's calls could have easily been taken for an act of
hooliganism," Kochergina said. "Most often, this is what such calls turn
out to be."</TE>
<TE>   In incomplete transcripts published in the newspaper Novaya Gazeta,
the caller reports his situation at 6:20 a.m. and at first is asked to
explain how he got into the truck and then to say where the truck is
heading.</TE>
<TE>   "I am being turned and twisted here, but I am still alive. Please call
the traffic police," he pleads.</TE>
<TE>   The call breaks off. A minute later, a different operator answers the
second call and asks again where he is.</TE>
<TE>   "How am I supposed to know?" he answers. "It is totally dark in here."</TE>
<TE>   The operator tells him to take matters into his own hands: "Can you
identify your presence, so that the driver would stop the truck and help
you out of it, young man? Have you got something to knock with? Where is
the driver?"</TE>
<TE>   "He can't hear me. I have found out already that he can't hear me!"</TE>
<TE>By the Third Call, Operator Seems Testy</TE>
<TE>   The call disconnects again, and by the third phone call, at 6:31 a.m.,
the operator begins to sound irritated with the caller for not trying
harder to alert the driver.</TE>
<TE>   "I have nothing to knock with! I am being squeezed!" the caller
explains.</TE>
<TE>   "Your hands are free since you have been able to dial the number. Find
something in the garbage," the operator says.</TE>
<TE>   During the final call, starting at 6:35 and ending at 6:43, the
operator persists in asking who played this "trick" on him: "Can you
remember your friends' telephone number? We will find out in a second
where you are."</TE>
<TE>   The caller isn't heard again.</TE>
<TE>   Someone apparently realized that it wasn't a prank: Shugayev's mother
said she got a mysterious phone call that evening from a rescue service
worker wanting to know if her son was at home.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked what happened to him. And she said, 'Nothing,' and hung up.
That really got me worried," she said. She alerted her ex-husband and the
next day went with him to the police to start the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Unwilling to rely on authorities, an anguished Boris Shugayev has
searched through the mounds of garbage at the suburban Salaryevo dump
himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how he got into the truck. I don't know where he is now.
But I do believe he really was making those desperate calls from there,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Anatoly Galibin, the driver of the state-of-the-art Mercedes garbage
truck that police now suspect was involved, said he would have thought it
improbable that anyone could have been dropped into his truck from a
garbage bin.</TE>
<TE>   He agreed, however, that if someone was covered by garbage, it might
have gone unnoticed. And any cries for help wouldn't have been heard.</TE>
<TE>   "If he was really inside and no one came to the rescue, he was
doomed," concluded Galibin, who blames police. He said his truck had
passed right in front of several traffic posts and a police station.</TE>
<TE>   "The police usually know which trucks work where, and they could have
easily tracked us down if they had wanted to," the driver said. "They
could have saved the guy."</TE>
<TE>   Alexeyeva, a former police colonel, said she too is outraged.</TE>
<TE>   "It all goes to show," she said, "that the life of a human being still
doesn't interest anybody in charge in this country."</TE>

<HD>Polish Firebrand Loses His Immunity</HD>
<DH>Politics: Lawmaker and union leader Andrzej Lepper could face two
years in prison if convicted of slandering five fellow officials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<AU>ELA KASPRZYCKA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>WARSAW
</DL>
<LD>Polish lawmakers stripped outspoken anti-establishment politician
Andrzej Lepper of parliamentary immunity Friday, opening the door to his
prosecution on slander charges and a possible prison term of up to two
years.</LD>
<LD>   The leader of Self-Defense, a farmers union and populist party that
holds the third-largest number of seats in Parliament, Lepper is seen by
some Poles as a hero who combats corruption and the sellout of Polish
national interests. Others view him as a threat to democracy.</LD>
<LD>   Lepper argues that the effort to prosecute him on slander charges
itself threatens democracy.</LD>
<TE>   Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly against Lepper. The outcome means that
he may be tried for alleging in a fiery speech in November that five
prominent politicians had taken bribes. Lepper phrased his most explosive
charges as questions, but that has not prevented legal action against
him.</TE>
<TE>   In two speeches to the lower house of Parliament, or Sejm, on Friday,
Lepper repeated his allegations in broader terms.</TE>
<TE>   "You have been robbing this country for 12 years," Lepper told his
colleagues over a loudspeaker system brought into Parliament by his party
after the legislative leadership cut off the official microphone. "This
is the truth society is going to hear. I'm ashamed of you."</TE>
<TE>   "There will be no anarchy in the Sejm, and Lepper will not rule here,"
Parliament Speaker Marek Borowski declared in the midst of the chaos.</TE>
<TE>   Friday evening, Lepper was allowed to give a speech that lasted more
than two hours, prompting comparison on the private TVN television
network to the marathon speeches for which Cuban President Fidel Castro
is famous.</TE>
<TE>   Lepper said he was not sorry for what he said in November.</TE>
<TE>   "I am saying that Poland's national wealth is being robbed," he
stressed. "We can all see it."</TE>
<TE>   He also blasted former Deputy Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz,
widely credited as the architect of Poland's post-Communist
market-oriented economic reforms, who is now president of the country's
central bank. Lepper said Self-Defense will ask an international tribunal
to charge Balcerowicz with "genocide" for creating economic conditions
under which families decide not to have more children.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the growing backlash from other politicians, Lepper retains
great ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not hide the fact that we want to take over power and will do
everything in order to rule Poland," he said in a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   With unemployment at 17% and economic growth falling to just 1% last
year compared with 4% in 2000, some of those who have suffered during the
transition to capitalism find appeal in Lepper's tough talk. In a
December survey by OBOP, a major polling agency, 39% of respondents said
Lepper acts for the "good" of democracy.</TE>
<TE>   In his November speech, Lepper said his suspicions of bribery were
based on information from a farm manager named Bogdan Gasinski.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, Gasinski, who has been accused of financial misconduct,
discredited himself in the eyes of investigators and the Polish public
with a fantastic laundry list of additional allegations. He claimed that
the Taliban had been experimenting with anthrax on the farm he had
managed and that politicians were involved in smuggling drugs from
Afghanistan that were disguised as shipments of gems.</TE>
<TE>   Borowski, the Parliament speaker, ridiculed Lepper's speech Friday by
referring to those claims.</TE>
<TE>   "I am tired and deeply disappointed, because last time it all led to
the Taliban [and] anthrax. . . . Those were interesting matters,"
Borowski said.</TE>
<TE>   "Andrzej Lepper uses the following method," Borowski added. "He says
something, humiliates someone and then says, 'Prove that this is not
true.' It is Andrzej Lepper who should prove that this is true."</TE>
<TE>   Citing an old Polish saying, Borowski added that "the person he is
pointing to should not have to prove he is not a camel."</TE>
<TE>   Wieslaw Walendziak, a member of Parliament from the Law and Justice
party, said people should not be too concerned about either Lepper or the
chaos in Parliament.</TE>
<TE>   "Lepper is a problem of the Polish Parliament but not as some say of
Polish democracy," Walendziak said. "It's the majority that makes
decisions. Such events happen also in mature democracies. Polish
democracy will manage this problem. One of the charms of democracy is
that we also have to live with such incidents."</TE>

<HD>India Test-Launches a Short-Range Missile</HD>
<DH>South Asia: Pakistan decries New Delhi's move. The two nations have
been in a standoff for more than a month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI
</DL>
<LD>India test-fired a short-range missile Friday that is capable of
carrying a nuclear warhead, and neighboring Pakistan called the launch
destabilizing amid a massive military buildup along their shared border.</LD>
<LD>   India insisted that there was no political message in the firing of
its newest version of the Agni ballistic missile, a weapon with a range
of about 420 miles. The missile was successfully fired over the Bay of
Bengal from the Wheeler Islands, off India's eastern coast.</LD>
<LD>   The government gave advance warning of the test to Pakistan and the
United States, among other countries, India's Foreign Ministry said.</LD>
<TE>   "Agni is an ongoing project. We are taking many more steps for the
nation's security and protection. This is one of them," Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee said after the Friday morning test was announced.</TE>
<TE>   The missile test had been postponed twice "for technical reasons," Lal
Krishna Advani, Vajpayee's hard-line home affairs minister, told
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and other foreign governments have been urging India and
Pakistan to step back from the brink of war since a Dec. 13 terrorist
attack on India's Parliament. Fourteen people died in the attack,
including the five gunmen, and India accused Pakistan's military
intelligence agency of complicity. Pakistan denied the charge.</TE>
<TE>   India and Pakistan both have ballistic missile programs, and each
conducted nuclear tests in 1998. International pressure has failed to
stop the South Asian arms race, and now that both countries are key
allies in the U.S.-led war on terrorism, there is less risk of sanctions
or other punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf's government said Friday that it
wouldn't respond with a missile test of its own, as Pakistan has in the
past, but it called on other governments to criticize India.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope the international community will take note of this Indian
behavior, which is prejudicial to the pursuit of stability in our region,
especially during the current situation," Pakistan's Foreign Ministry
said. "On its part, Pakistan favors a policy of restraint.</TE>
<TE>   "Pakistan has the means to defend itself," the statement added.</TE>
<TE>   Nirupama Rao, a spokeswoman for India's Foreign Ministry, insisted
that Friday's missile test wasn't provocative, telling reporters, "The
test was undertaken in a predictable and transparent manner."</TE>
<TE>   India first tested an Agni missile in May 1989, when it modified a
rocket developed for its civilian space program to fire a ballistic
missile. The Agni had a range of 1,500 miles carrying a 2,200-pound
warhead and brought China, a close ally of Pakistan, into range of an
Indian missile strike.</TE>
<TE>   In April 1999, India successfully tested the Agni II, with a
theoretical range of 1,800 miles. India was expected to deploy several
dozen of the missiles, according to a report by the Federation of
American Scientists, which added, "It is suggested that a 200-kiloton
'boosted-fission' warhead has been designed for the Agni system."</TE>
<TE>   India and Pakistan haven't said publicly whether they are capable of
mounting nuclear warheads on their ballistic missiles. India has a stated
policy that it will not be the first to use nuclear weapons, but Pakistan
has made no such commitment.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions between the nuclear powers have been on a razor's edge since
the Dec. 13 attack. This week, New Delhi again accused Pakistan's
military intelligence, the Inter-Services Intelligence agency, of
fomenting violence in India when at least one gunman on a motorcycle
opened fire with an assault rifle outside the American Center in
Calcutta, killing five Indian police guards.</TE>
<TE>   Indian police and political leaders immediately called the Tuesday
attack a terrorist strike, but they became more cautious after the FBI
suggested that the incident could have been a criminal gang's revenge
attack on police.</TE>
<TE>   Although Advani also sounded a bit more cautious Friday, he said that
previous investigations into the kidnapping ring suspected in Tuesday's
attack found that the gangsters had links to Pakistani military
intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   Interpol, the international police organization, issued a warrant
Friday for the arrest of a man in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, who
called a senior Calcutta police officer to take credit for the American
Center shooting, according to Advani.</TE>
<TE>   He identified the caller as Farhan Malik, also known as Aftab Ansari,
a suspected member of the kidnapping gang.</TE>
<TE>   The attackers escaped, and Calcutta police are still searching for
them.</TE>
<TE>   Islamic militants and organized crime have cooperated in India for
years, police investigators say. A string of bomb blasts that killed 257
people in Bombay in March 1993 proved the connection, Advani said.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since that, we have been conscious that those indulging in
cross-border terrorism in India have been utilizing mafia gangmen for the
purpose," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has agreed to share information with Indian investigators
probing Tuesday's attack, Advani said, and U.S. officials have already
handed over a security camera videotape. But the attackers' faces aren't
visible in the recording, Advani said.</TE>

<LD>Argentine riot police firing tear gas clashed with dozens of
demonstrators in the capital late Friday, marring what was a peaceful but
noisy nationwide protest against economic austerity measures.</LD>
<LD>   At least 10 police officers and three people in the crowd were
reported injured, including a man who collapsed with rubber-bullet wounds
to his back. One officer was hospitalized with serious injuries, police
said. At least a dozen people were seen being detained by police.</LD>
<LD>   The violence flared after thousands of peaceful demonstrators had
already left the downtown Plaza de Mayo, which fronts the government
palace.</LD>
<TE>   More than 10,000 middle-class, corporate and unemployed Argentines
stood side by side on the square for hours early Friday night, calling
for an end to the tight banking curbs and other government steps taken to
end the nation's recession.</TE>
<TE>   Police stood guard behind iron barricades as President Eduardo
Duhalde's government strengthened security.</TE>
<TE>   After the Plaza de Mayo clashes subsided early Saturday, several
hundred demonstrators regrouped near Congress, blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   Raucous pan-beating protests flared in various districts across Buenos
Aires and in cities throughout Argentina, including Mar del Plata, a
popular Atlantic beach resort, and Salta, a western provincial city.</TE>

<DH>Mideast: F-16s hit Palestinian security targets after a suicide
attack injures 29 at a Tel Aviv pedestrian mall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israeli warplanes struck Palestinian security targets in the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank town of Tulkarm on Friday night, hours after a
suicide bomber detonated an explosives-laden belt in a busy Tel Aviv
pedestrian mall, killing himself and wounding 29 people.</LD>
<LD>   The F-16 airstrikes marked the latest escalation in an intensifying
cycle of killing and revenge that has frustrated U.S. peace efforts and
fueled nearly 16 months of Israeli-Palestinian fighting.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinians reported that seven people were injured in the attack on
the Ansar security compound in Gaza City, next to Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat's headquarters on the Mediterranean coast. A
security officer was killed and 40 people were wounded in the Tulkarm
strike, according to Palestinians.</LD>
<TE>   An Israeli army spokesman said two targets were hit "in response to
Palestinian terror attacks." He said a previously targeted government
building in Tulkarm was hit again because "Tulkarm serves as a point of
departure for terrorists," and the Tel Aviv bomber "left from Tulkarm."
The spokesman said planes also struck at a depot for armored cars
belonging to Force 17, Arafat's presidential guard.</TE>
<TE>   The army said the compound in Gaza was hit in retaliation for the
Palestinians' firing of Kassem rockets Friday at the Erez crossing
between Gaza and Israel. No one was hurt by the rockets.</TE>
<TE>   "We said either he [Arafat] dismantles the coalition of terror or we
dismantle it, and that's what we're doing," Raanan Gissin, spokesman for
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, said in a telephone interview Friday
night.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli reprisal raids came as security forces across the nation
remained on high alert, anticipating a Palestinian attack in response to
Israel's killing Thursday night of an Islamic militant in the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   In Jerusalem on Tuesday, a Palestinian gunman killed two women when he
sprayed a busy downtown street with gunfire before police shot him dead.
In the West Bank and Gaza Strip on Thursday, six Palestinians died in
four incidents, including the nighttime helicopter gunship attack on
Bakar Hamdan, 26, whom Israel identified as the military commander of the
militant Hamas movement in the town of Khan Yunis.</TE>
<TE>   Hours later, the Palestinian bomber blew himself up as he strolled
along the pedestrian mall in gritty south Tel Aviv, an area of small
cafes, bars and shops frequented by foreign workers and recent
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   The attack came about 11 a.m. as Israelis were rushing to prepare for
the start of the Jewish Sabbath.</TE>
<TE>   "A suicide bomber with an explosives belt blew himself up," said Yossi
Sedbon, Tel Aviv's police chief. The force of the blast ripped the
bomber's body in half, according to police spokesman Gil Kleiman.</TE>
<TE>   The militant Palestinian group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility
for the attack. It said the bomber was 18-year-old Safwat Khalil from a
village near the West Bank town of Nablus.</TE>
<TE>   About 15 ambulances converged on the area and took the wounded to
nearby hospitals. Most were in shock or suffered minor injuries, but
three of the wounded were reportedly in serious condition. A 4-year-old
boy, who was walking with his father and pregnant mother when the blast
occurred, suffered a broken leg, according to a spokeswoman for Tel
Aviv's Ichilov Hospital, where 21 of the injured were treated. The boy's
name was withheld because of his age.</TE>
<TE>   Chen Meir, 32, said he was working in his supermarket with his
brothers when he heard the explosion. "I bent down and heard this huge
explosion" Meir said. "I looked around, put my hand on my head, felt
blood there."</TE>
<TE>   His brother took him and three other wounded people they picked up off
the street to the hospital in his car, Meir said. Doctors removed a bolt
from his head. Police said the explosive device the bomber carried was
packed with metal bolts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a good person and I do good things and, hopefully, that's what
saved me," said the married father of two, who wore a fresh bandage on
his head as he spoke with reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The government was quick to blame Arafat for the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "All the signs point to one of the extremist Palestinian groups, but
again, the responsibility belongs to the Palestinian Authority, which is
continuing a policy of terror," Danny Ayalon, Sharon's foreign policy
advisor, told the Reuters news agency.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian Authority issued an official condemnation of the
killing of Israeli civilians and said it also condemned the killing of
Palestinians the day before in Gaza and the West Bank. Palestinian
officials say the army's resumption this month of its "targeted killings"
of militants--which Palestinians call assassinations--has made it
impossible to impose a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has vowed to retaliate for every Palestinian attack carried out
against Israelis. Israel has repeatedly targeted Palestinian security
compounds in response to such attacks, accusing Palestinian security
services of complicity in many bombings.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian Authority says the attacks on its security branches
make it nearly impossible for authorities to hunt down the militants whom
Israel wants arrested.</TE>

<HD>2 Canadians Tied to Terrorist Plots</HD>
<DH>Citizens: Tunisian-born men are suspected of planning suicide
missions against the U.S. They are at large and considered 'extremely
dangerous.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>U.S. authorities drew their first firm link Friday between Canada
and Al Qaeda-trained terrorists since the Sept. 11 hijackings,
identifying two Canadian citizens who are suspected of plotting suicide
attacks against America.</LD>
<LD>   The two Tunisian-born men, a known Al Qaeda operative and his
associate, are thought to have left Canada some months ago and are on the
lam, law enforcement officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said he did not know whether the men might be
in the United States. Even so, he urged the public to be on the lookout
for the pair. The Justice Department released photographs of the men, Al
Rauf bin Al Habib bin Yousef Al-Jiddi, 36, and Faker Boussora, 37.
Ashcroft said they should be considered "extremely dangerous."</LD>
<TE>   Although Ashcroft's repeated terrorist-related warnings since Sept. 11
have drawn criticism from some quarters as excessive and somewhat
alarmist, the attorney general and his advisors said in releasing the new
photos that the public should have as much information as possible and
use "vigilance and common sense" to help deter attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The identification of the pair will likely focus renewed attention on
security concerns in Canada, which some critics branded a "Club Med for
terrorists" in 1999 after an Algerian-born resident tried to sneak into
the U.S. with a trunkload of explosives.</TE>
<TE>   Jiddi represents the first Al Qaeda operative "positively identified"
as a citizen of Canada since the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon, said Dan Brien, a spokesman for the Canadian
solicitor general.</TE>
<TE>   "To this point, we haven't had any evidence of a link between Canada
and the events of Sept. 11," Brien said. "There's a lot of interest in
[Jiddi and Boussora] because now there's a name and a face. We've been
saying for some time that there are people involved in terrorism in this
country--as there are in every industrialized country in the world. Our
job is to bring them to justice and make sure they don't carry out their
terrorist acts."</TE>
<TE>   Jiddi was one of five suspected Al Qaeda operatives identified in
videotaped messages of anti-American martyrdom that the U.S. military
found in the rubble of a top Osama bin Laden aide's home in Afghanistan
some weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft identified the other four operatives publicly last week, but
authorities had been unable to put a name with Jiddi's face until they
matched him to a suicide letter also found in the rubble.</TE>
<TE>   With the aid of Canadian law enforcement, U.S. officials traced Jiddi
to Montreal, where he apparently lived after his arrival in Canada in
1991 until recently. He became a Canadian citizen in 1995. U.S. and
Canadian law enforcement officials said they believe he left the area
several months ago, but it is not known whether it was before or after
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Boussora, an unlikely looking terrorist suspect, with a boyish face
and what Ashcroft called "prominent ears," was described as a known
associate of Jiddi who authorities believe may be traveling with him.</TE>
<TE>   Boussora is also a Canadian.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal was also the home in the late 1990s of Ahmed Ressam, the
would-be terrorist whose plot to bomb LAX in December 1999 was thwarted
when he was discovered at the U.S. border north of Seattle with
explosives in his car. It was later revealed he had trained at two jihad
terrorist camps in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. investigators want to determine whether Ressam may have known
Jiddi and Boussora or whether they traveled in the same circles in
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate development, forensic evidence taken from the sneakers
worn by bombing suspect Richard C. Reid indicates he may not have acted
alone when he allegedly attempted to blow up a Miami-bound plane last
month, CNN reported. Palm prints and hair samples taken from the shoes
did not belong to the 28-year-old British citizen, the network reported.</TE>

<HD>Bush to Seek $10.7 Billion for Borders</HD>
<DH>Budget: President's initiative would be a fivefold boost for
security. It calls for the hiring of new patrol and immigration agents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Maine
</DL>
<LD>President Bush said Friday that he will seek $10.7 billion in new
funds to bolster security along America's borders and its shorelines,
part of his administration's broader effort to improve the nation's
protections against foreign terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   Bush said his new budget request, if approved by Congress, would
represent a fivefold increase over current spending for border and
shoreline security.</LD>
<LD>   The initiative would allow the hiring of about 1,000 new immigration
and customs agents and inspectors, as well as the modernization of a
system to track the arrival and departure of noncitizens, the White House
said.</LD>
<TE>   A projected 350 new border patrol agents would be deployed along the
U.S.-Canadian border, said Gordon Johndroe, a spokesman for the White
House office of homeland security. Concern has grown since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks about the extent of security along the Canadian border.</TE>
<TE>   No immediate increases along the U.S.-Mexican border are planned,
Johndroe said, because recent additions along that border have brought
the number of agents to about 9,000.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at Southern Maine Technical College, Bush also sought to head
off business concerns that stricter border security would slow
international trade.</TE>
<TE>   The president said he would seek to make sure that the border
initiative "does not tie up commerce but, on the other hand, prevents
illegal drugs, terrorists [and] arms from flowing across our border."</TE>
<TE>   His appearance here marked the third straight day he has focused on
security priorities that will be in his proposed 2003 fiscal year budget,
which he will submit Feb. 4. He also is expected to highlight these goals
in his State of the Union speech to a joint session of Congress Tuesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Bush announced he will seek a $48-billion increase
in military spending and a boost of $38 billion in overall spending for
homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   The $10.7 billion for border and shoreline security spending that he
highlighted Friday is part of the money request for homeland protection.
Much of the remainder would be used for stockpiling medicines, upgrading
public health infrastructure and upgrading police, fire and rescue
services around the country.</TE>
<TE>   Despite an abrupt return to huge federal budget deficits, brought on
by the recession and the Sept. 11 attacks, Bush touted his spending
initiatives for homeland security without apology.</TE>
<TE>   "The price of victory is well worth it," he told hundreds of people
crammed into a gymnasium at the college. "My biggest job is to make sure
our homeland is secure."</TE>
<TE>   He warned that the threat of more terrorist attacks remains very real.</TE>
<TE>   "The enemy still wants to hit us. And therefore this nation must do
everything in our power to prevent it," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the president's proposal, the Customs Service's inspection
budget would grow by $619 million, to $2.3 billion. The increase would
allow the agency, which has 10,000 inspectors and agents, to hire 800
more. In addition, the service would be able to purchase technologically
advanced equipment that can expedite inspections.</TE>
<TE>   The Immigration and Naturalization Service's enforcement budget would
grow by $1.2 billion, to $5.3 billion. In addition to hiring new border
patrol agents, the agency would use the funds to install integrated
systems to provide timely enforcement data to agents in the field.</TE>
<TE>   The Coast Guard's homeland security-related budget would grow by $282
million, to $2.9 billion. Since the terrorist attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon, the Coast Guard's port-security mission has
grown from about 2% of its daily operations to 50% to 60%, according to
the White House.</TE>
<TE>   The new funds would allow the Coast Guard to develop more
sophisticated mechanisms to track vessels.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the Agriculture Department's quarantine inspection budget
would grow by $14 million, to $61 million. The funds would enable the
agency to acquire additional resources and equipment to better conduct
inspections at border crossings and on flights entering the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge of providing "the smart border of the future," as the
White House dubbed Bush's spending initiative, is steep.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, noncitizens make about 330 million legal visits to the
United States. Of these, an estimated 40% overstay their visas, according
to the INS.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said an improved tracking system would target such visitors.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things we want to make sure of is we find the 40% to make
sure they're not part of some Al Qaeda network that wants to hit the
United States," Bush said, referring to the terrorist group led by Osama
bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   The 11.2 million trucks and 2.2 million rail cars that cross into the
U.S. each year, and the 7,500 foreign-flagged ships that make 51,000
calls in U.S. ports annually present another immense challenge for border
security authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Upon his arrival here, the president went to the Portland Marine
International Terminal, where he toured the U.S. Coast Guard cutter
Tahoma. The 100-crew cutter was the command vessel in New York Harbor on
Sept. 11 and then stayed on for 40 days afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in the cutter's cramped, low-ceilinged mess hall, Bush told
several dozen crew members: "We're winning, and I want to thank you all
for helping us win. But we've got a lot to do."</TE>
<TE>   After his speech, the president flew to Camp David, the presidential
retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains, where he was to host about 20
senior congressional Republicans on Friday night for a legislative
strategy session--and a sleepover.</TE>
<TE>   The group was expected to view "Black Hawk Down," a recently released
movie that graphically depicts a U.S. raid against a warlord in
Mogadishu, Somalia, in which 18 American soldiers were killed.</TE>

<LD>Mourners filed past the flag-draped coffin of Marine Sgt. Jeannette
L. Winters on Friday, the first U.S. servicewoman killed since Afghan
bombing began in October.</LD>
<LD>   She was eulogized as a proud Marine and the person who held her family
together after her mother's death. Winters' coffin was carried by eight
Marines in a color guard into the downtown convention center for the
funeral.</LD>
<LD>   Winters, 25, was among seven Marines killed Jan. 9 when a KC-130
tanker plane crashed in Pakistan. She was buried with full military
honors Friday at Calumet Park Cemetery in Merrillville.</LD>
<TE>   Her brother, Marine Sgt. Matthew Winters Jr., recalled her saying
after their mother's death in 1994 to always be strong because their
mother would always be with them. "Today I am confident in those same
words. I know Jeannette is watching me right now, and I will keep my head
up for her and I will be strong."</TE>
<TE>   Fellow Marines are proud of Winters, who was based at the Marine Corps
Air Station Miramar in San Diego, said her platoon commander, 1st Lt.
Jeni Froehlich.</TE>

<HD>Intelligence Gaps Preceding Attacks Subject of Inquiry</HD>
<DH>Congress: Senate and House panels begin looking into U.S. spy
agencies' lapses leading up to Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Senate and House intelligence committees quietly began sending
notices this week to the nation's spy agencies, requesting documents and
other evidence for a pending probe of intelligence failures surrounding
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The letters mark the opening of a high-stakes inquiry that could
determine whether the intelligence community overlooked possible warning
signs and missed opportunities to prevent the attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The probe had been delayed, largely because members of Congress were
reluctant to distract intelligence officials in the frantic aftermath of
the attacks and the ensuing war in Afghanistan. Some lawmakers also
expressed concern that the inquiry could lead to a demoralizing witch
hunt.</LD>
<TE>   But ranking members of the House and Senate intelligence panels set
the investigation in motion this week after reaching an agreement that
calls for the two panels to share staff and resources for the probe and
to hold joint hearings this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said Friday that the first wave of letters requesting
documents and records from spy agencies went out in the last few days.</TE>
<TE>   "We made requests of the agencies under our jurisdiction," which
includes the CIA and at least 13 other spy agencies, Graham said. "We
anticipate that for the next 60 days, [the committees' activities] will
primarily be the collection and review of documents and the
identification of witnesses."</TE>
<TE>   A CIA official said the agency had not received a request from
Congress for records.</TE>
<TE>   "We will consider their request and respond appropriately," he said.
"We work closely with the oversight committees on a regular basis and
will assist them as best we can."</TE>
<TE>   The scope of the investigation will be expansive, Graham said,
covering the CIA's efforts to combat terrorists since the agency
established its counterterrorism center in the mid-1980s.</TE>
<TE>   But a central focus, he said, will be on determining what U.S.
intelligence agencies knew before Sept. 11 and how the CIA, which had a
task force focused on terrorist leader Osama bin Laden for several years,
could have been caught so off guard by the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "The public deserves an answer to that, and we will try to provide
it," Graham said.</TE>
<TE>   The probe is certain to be a source of embarrassment to the spy
community, which has been upbraided by Congress for a string of blunders
in recent years, including the failure to anticipate nuclear weapon tests
in India.</TE>
<TE>   But there are also signs that the mood in Congress has softened since
Sept. 11, when many lawmakers were sharply critical of the CIA and some
called for the ouster of its director, George J. Tenet.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.), a member of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said America's successful military campaign in Afghanistan has
improved the intelligence community's standing in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "That has had some impact," Edwards said. "My view is that serious
mistakes were made before Sept. 11. But our war in Afghanistan and our
effort against terrorism have been intelligence-driven, and obviously
that effort has been successful."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forces have yet to locate Bin Laden, the alleged sponsor of the
attacks, or Mullah Mohammed Omar, the leader of Afghanistan's defeated
Taliban regime. But Edwards and other lawmakers who have visited
Afghanistan recently said they came away with an understanding of the
difficulty of that mission.</TE>
<TE>   And while there are still some voices on Capitol Hill calling for
Tenet's ouster, many members of the intelligence committees have lobbied
to steer the inquiry away from assigning blame.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm interested in a very effective investigation with a focus on
protecting us against the second wave" of terrorism, said Rep. Jane
Harman (D-Venice), a member of the House intelligence committee. "If you
demoralize people, it's counterproductive."</TE>
<TE>   Graham said that the committees have begun to hire additional staff
members to manage the inquiry and that hearings could stretch into the
summer. Given the classified nature of the material, he said, it's not
clear how many of the joint committee's hearings will be public.</TE>

<LD>Even as New Yorkers emotionally debate what kind of memorial should
honor those killed in the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center,
50,000 tons of mangled metal from the twin towers have already been sold
off and shipped to China as scrap.</LD>
<LD>   China's largest steel company denied reports that it plans to make
souvenirs out of metal from the collapsed buildings. But officials at
Shanghai Baosteel here said the company did buy scrap from the wreckage.</LD>
<LD>   For those involved in the deal, the purchase was an ordinary business
transaction.</LD>
<TE>   "Scrap from the World Trade Center is cheap, and the quality is good,"
said Cao Xianggen, an engineer at Baosteel. "America can't use it all,
but China has a huge demand for it."</TE>
<TE>   For some victims' families, however, the selling of the steel that
entombed their loved ones could prove an example of coldhearted global
trade.</TE>
<TE>   The families had made emotional appeals to the city of New York to
stop the recycling until further clues could be found about the towers'
collapse. New York officials said the investigation could continue
without the physical wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, city officials confirmed that at least two companies had
bid successfully on scrap material from the trade center, but they
stressed that they didn't know what became of the material after it was
bought.</TE>
<TE>   Baosteel, which is based in this port city, is believed to have bought
the steel from one of the two companies. A staff member at the firm's
shipping department said late Friday that a ship carrying the scrap left
the United States in mid-December but that it probably wouldn't reach
China on schedule. Part of the 50,000-ton purchase had been due to arrive
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   China is one of the world's leading producers of steel. During the
Great Leap Forward in the 1950s, the country wanted to prove its
self-sufficiency, so it required all citizens to turn in pots and pans,
antique furniture decorations, any metal objects they could find--all for
the purpose of forging steel.</TE>
<TE>   Today, China relies on other countries for its raw material. In 2000,
the country imported 5.1 million tons of scrap, according to the Shanghai
Daily. The average selling price is about $150 a ton, the newspaper said.</TE>
<TE>   Baosteel bought some of the remains of the World Trade Center for $120
a ton, according to the official Beijing Youth Daily.</TE>
<TE>   The management office at Metal Management in New Jersey, one of the
two original buyers, did not return calls.</TE>
<TE>   But Alan Ratner, president of Metal Management, told the New York
Daily News last month: "This is recycling at its purest form. Our job is
to take material and find a beneficial reuse for it."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the wreckage, Ratner said, will be donated to a memorial.</TE>
<TE>   With nearly 3,000 people having died at the World Trade Center, and
weighing the sensitivity of U.S.-China relations, Baosteel has vehemently
denied reports made by the Beijing Youth Daily that the company might
profit from sales of mini-trade center replicas.</TE>
<TE>   "Baosteel absolutely did not buy scrap with the intention of making
arts and craft," read a posting on the company's Web site Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese industry experts stress that Baosteel simply made a sound
business decision based on the high quality of the steel from the trade
center. Indian firms also bought scrap from New York's disaster zone.</TE>
<TE>   The trade center wreckage is expected to produce an estimated 300,000
tons of structural steel. The girders, columns and beams will be melted
down and reforged into building materials in Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, such scrap is used to construct skyscrapers, roads,
bridges, cars and some household appliances.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the steel at the World Trade Center was made in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "Back in the 1970s, it was considered the finest quality in the
world," a Baosteel official who gave only his last name, Xu, told a local
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. scrap-recycling industry is worth at least $20 billion a
year. Asia has been an important market because buyers in the region tend
to pay more than U.S. outlets.</TE>
<TE>   "The global steel industry is now concentrated in China, India, Japan
and Korea," said another Baosteel official, who gave only his last name,
Yang. "It's normal that scrap from the WTC would be exported to China and
India. This is a result of the global division of labor."</TE>

<DL>GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba
</DL>
<LD>Some of the Afghan war detainees now held at Guantanamo Bay could
be returned to their homelands after interrogations and face military
tribunals there, a U.S. senator said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The 158 detainees come from 25 countries, Marine Brig. Gen. Michael
Lehnert told reporters without identifying the nations. Republican Sen.
James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma said he did not think more than 15% were from
Afghanistan. Previously, officials said detainees at this U.S. military
outpost were from 10 countries.</LD>
<LD>   "I think in the interrogation process we're going to find that some of
them will be legitimately sent back to their countries," Inhofe said of
the Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters.</LD>
<TE>   Inhofe's spokesman, Jared Young, later said that the senator stressed
that sending the detainees home was a possibility that the Bush
administration is considering and no decisions have been made.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) said he favored military tribunals to
handle the prisoners' cases.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly do not need to create a federal court spectacle for all
these cases," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners at Camp X-ray were not
being mistreated and were being given adequate food and medical care.</TE>
<TE>   Inhofe and Sessions were part of a delegation of 17 representatives
and three senators who visited the detention center Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. delegation was driven on white buses into Camp X-ray, which
is fortified by three layers of fences topped by razor wire and patrolled
by attack dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing was hidden from us," said Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.).</TE>

<HD>U.S. Destroys Munitions Cache After Raids on 2 Afghan Sites</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>U.S. forces discovered--and then destroyed--a significant cache of
munitions at two Afghan military compounds raided early Thursday,
Pentagon officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of mortars and rockets and roughly half a million rounds of
small-arms ammunition were found, said Rear Adm. John D. Stufflebeem,
deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</LD>
<LD>   An AC-130 gunship was called in to destroy the cache, Stufflebeem
said.</LD>
<TE>   The Pentagon had thought that the sites, near the central Afghan town
of Hazar Qadam, were hide-outs for fighters of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
terrorist organization, but they turned out to be populated mostly by
members of the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   About 15 enemy fighters were killed in the attack by U.S. soldiers,
and 27 prisoners were taken, officials said. One American Green Beret was
wounded in an ankle by enemy fire.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said the prisoners were mainly
Taliban members and included some "relatively senior" figures.
Stufflebeem said they were being screened and interrogated at the
Kandahar airport in southern Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan authorities also turned over five prisoners to U.S. forces in
Kandahar on Thursday and Friday, Stufflebeem said, bringing the total
there to 302.</TE>
<TE>   The transfer of prisoners from Kandahar to the U.S. Navy base at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, remained on hold Friday. Stufflebeem said the
decision to stop the transfers was made by Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld.</TE>
<TE>   In a related development, a Predator unmanned surveillance plane
crashed in bad weather in Afghanistan on Friday. It was the second of the
fragile and still experimental reconnaissance drones to crash this week
and the fourth since the Afghanistan campaign began. In addition, three
Predators flown by the military over Iraq have crashed since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The drone, which flies as high as 25,000 feet, can take pictures and
listen to enemy communications. An entire Predator system, including a
ground-control station and four aircraft, costs about $25 million.</TE>
<TE>   Predators have seen heavy use in Afghanistan, including by the CIA,
which has armed them with missiles to attack Taliban and Al Qaeda
targets.</TE>

<HD>Invading Birds Have Town Up a Tree</HD>
<DH>Nuisance: Citizens have used everything, even a cannon, to shoo
away the thousands of noisy starlings. To no avail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BREESE, Ill.
</DL>
<LD>This trim farm town on the prairie turns creepy each day at dawn
and dusk.</LD>
<LD>   Just before sunset, the sky convulses. Black clouds race toward town.
They swoop in over the high school and, suddenly, it's clear: Each cloud
is really a dense flock of birds, thousands upon thousands upon thousands
of starlings descending on Breese to roost for the night.</LD>
<LD>   At dawn, look up and there they are--starlings clustered by the
hundreds in every tree, packed in so tight that bare winter branches look
like feathered pillows.</LD>
<TE>   The droppings slick sidewalks, cars, cows and swing sets white. Some
patches of grass look as though they've been dusted with crumbly snow.
And the noise! The chirping. The chattering. "My husband is hard of
hearing, and even he complains of it," confided 73-year-old Dolly
Niemann.</TE>
<TE>   This is a town under starling siege. And the birds are winning, big.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to go out with buckets to wash [the droppings] off," said
Raquel Strubhart, a mother of three. "My neighbor said I might as well
give up, because the birds will always beat you."</TE>
<TE>   In the three months since the starling swarms arrived, Breese has
tried just about everything to shoo the birds away.</TE>
<TE>   First, the Police Department bought a small cannon and fired off boom
after boom. All that did was chase the birds a few blocks down the
street. Chief James Hummert next tried firecrackers. The starlings barely
winced.</TE>
<TE>   On their own, residents have tried setting out balloons painted to
look like predators or clapping pieces of lumber together to make noise.
Town officials won't let them hunt the starlings, for fear that Breese
soon would be bristling with guns. Instead, locals throw rocks at the
birds or shine bright lights in the trees where they roost.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the starlings come.</TE>
<TE>   In desperation, several local farmers last week paid the U.S.
Department of Agriculture to spread poison where the birds feed. The
result: Thousands of dead birds dropped from the sky over Breese
throughout the weekend, thudding to the ground in such numbers that one
man thought for sure the town (population 4,020) was under biological
assault.</TE>
<TE>   One elderly woman picked up 117 pounds of dead starlings in her yard,
Hummert said. Others reported shoveling dozens of carcasses into the
trash. On the lawn of one vacant house near City Hall, more than 100 dead
birds still carpet the grass--and others hang upside-down from the trees,
their claws frozen in a death grip around the bare limbs.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all the carnage, the poison "didn't put a dent" in the
starling infestation, Hummert said. "Not even the slightest dent."</TE>
<TE>   Starling invasions actually are nothing new to Breese. Huge flocks of
the birds pass through every winter as they migrate south along the
Mississippi River. Usually, the birds continue farther south, looking for
a warm factory smokestack or a steamy power plant to use as a winter
roost.</TE>
<TE>   This year, however, the balmy weather apparently has persuaded the
birds to tarry here. And they have found the town quite hospitable--the
odd cannon blasts aside. The high-protein cattle feed set out at dairy
farms all around Breese makes for a perfect starling buffet. The birds
gorge themselves during the day, then return to town to roost in trees,
huddling in clusters for extra warmth.</TE>
<TE>   Other towns along the migration route, from central Illinois on south,
also have reported starling woes this winter, said Kirk Gustad, director
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's wildlife services office in
Springfield, Ill. "It's a significant problem all around the state," he
said. "There can be anywhere from a thousand birds in a flock to a couple
million."</TE>
<TE>   No one's counted the birds in Breese. All they know is, there are way
too many.</TE>
<TE>   The other day, Jim Dumstorff filled the bird feeder at his cabin a few
miles north of town. Within a half-hour, the feeder was invisible under a
swaying ball of starlings. And the lawn--about the size of a football
field--was swarming with thousands more. "The ground was black,"
Dumstorff said, still astounded.</TE>
<TE>   The European starlings that have taken over Breese are pretty little
birds, their dark feathers streaked with shimmers of metallic purple,
green and gold. But their droppings can cause respiratory disorders if
inhaled. And residents say they cannot scrub the droppings away fast
enough. They clean a car or a toddler's plastic slide and by the next
morning, it's splotched white again. The city's public works department
doesn't even attempt to keep the sidewalks clean. "We're waiting for the
rain to wash it all off," Mayor Donald Maue said.</TE>
<TE>   In a last-ditch effort to get the upper hand, some in Breese have
taken to chopping down the gracious old trees that provide such cozy
roosts. A local church recently cut down 17 Bradford pears because too
many worshipers were being splattered with droppings on their way to
morning services.</TE>
<TE>   "So many beautiful oak trees have been cut down in this town,"
lamented Dumstorff, who owns the Breese Lawn and Garden store. "It's sad,
but what can you do with these dang birds?"</TE>
<TE>   More poison might be one option. The toxin the USDA uses breaks down
quickly in the starlings' bodies, so the carcasses pose no danger to
animals or humans. But when the infestation is as bad as it is in Breese,
poisonous pellets only go so far.</TE>
<TE>   "It kills all of 'em that eat it," Gustad said. "But the next day . .
. it will look like we didn't do anything." Often, he said, there's just
one real solution: "Tolerate the birds." After all, they should fly back
north come spring.</TE>
<TE>   Or so folks in Breese dearly hope.</TE>

<HD>Dad Sentenced to 6 to 10 Years for Rink Death</HD>
<DH>Crime: Thomas Junta fatally beat Michael Costin, another father, in
July 2000 after their children finished a pickup game of hockey.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hockey dad Thomas Junta was sentenced Friday to six to 10 years in
prison for beating another father, Michael Costin, to death at a suburban
Boston ice rink while their children watched.</LD>
<LD>   Although Junta faced as much as 20 years in jail for his involuntary
manslaughter conviction, the sentence was harsher than many expected
because state guidelines call for a three- to five-year prison term for
first offenses. Junta's attorney Thomas Orlandi Jr. said Friday that he
would appeal the decision.</LD>
<LD>   However, Middlesex Superior Court Judge Charles Grabau, in explaining
his sentence, noted that Junta had a record of violence and that the
crime during the summer of 2000 was made that much more heinous because
so many children, including Junta's own son and the victim's three sons,
witnessed the brutality. The judge also noted that Junta continued the
beating after many people tried to stop him.</LD>
<TE>   Junta, 44, began sobbing in the Cambridge, Mass., courtroom before the
sentencing as Orlandi read letters he had written to his two children.</TE>
<TE>   "Remember, hockey is supposed to be fun, but it's just a game," Junta
wrote to 12-year-old Quinlan, who was among those pleading with his
father to stop the beating. The boy had testified that Junta acted in
self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   But in a moving statement about Costin, who had led a troubled life,
the dead man's middle son, Michael, implored the judge to be tough on
Junta:</TE>
<TE>   "My dad isn't there in the morning to wake me up. My dad isn't there
when I play sports. My dad doesn't cook us dinner anymore. . . . Please
teach Thomas Junta a lesson."</TE>
<TE>   Although the defense attempted to portray Junta, a truck driver who
weighed 275 pounds at the time of the attack, as a "gentle giant," it
became apparent during a pre-sentencing investigation that it was not the
first time he had become violent.</TE>
<TE>Alleged Domestic Violence in 1991</TE>
<TE>   The judge pointed out that Junta had a restraining order against him
in 1991 for allegedly beating his wife, Michelle, in front of their two
children. A court at the time ordered Junta out of the couple's apartment
and gave his wife temporary custody of the children.</TE>
<TE>   However, Orlandi insisted the order was irrelevant, noting the couple
still are together. But the judge read from part of that order, inferring
it had influenced his sentencing decision.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also expressed dismay that the defense Friday revealed the
victim's past legal problems to the courtroom, information that was kept
from the jury during the trial because it was not pertinent to the case.</TE>
<TE>   Costin, 40, and his wife were divorced and had four children, ages 11
to 14. He apparently had for many years had a severe drinking problem and
had served time in prison. But Costin had stopped drinking, was working
as a carpenter and painter and, six months before his death, had regained
custody of his children.</TE>
<TE>Argument Escalated Into Deadly Fight</TE>
<TE>   The fight with Junta occurred July 5, 2000, at a rink in Reading, just
north of Boston. The Costin children and their father were skating and
joined a pickup game against a group of boys including Junta's son. Junta
was watching from the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   When the game got rough, Junta charged out onto the ice and argued
with Costin. Later they scuffled in the locker room until a college-age
hockey player separated them. But outside the locker room they started
fighting again, and this time the 156-pound Costin did not get up. He
suffered severe head and neck injuries.</TE>
<TE>   During the weeklong trial, Quinlan Junta testified that his father had
hit Costin only three times quickly.</TE>
<TE>   But rink manager Nancy Blanchard and several others said they saw the
much larger Junta strike Costin as many as 10 times. Junta also bruised
Blanchard during the imbroglio, pushing her aside when she tried to stop
the men from fighting. Photographs of her bruises were shown to the judge
and jurors at the trial.</TE>
<TE>   During the sentencing, Junta, wearing handcuffs, said little. He hung
his head for most of the time and cried intermittently. He spoke once,
quietly. "I'd just like to apologize to both families and thank my family
for all their support of me," he said. The defense called no witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Before being led away, Junta raised his shackled hands to blow a kiss
and wave to his family seated behind him.</TE>
<TE>   Later, chief prosecutor Martha Coakley issued a statement saying she
was satisfied with the sentence, but she also conceded that nothing good
had come of this case.</TE>
<TE>   "One and a half years ago, the Costin family lost a father, the full
impact of which they continue to feel to this day," she said. "Today, a
second father is sentenced to a substantial prison term. Clearly, there
are no winners in this case."</TE>

<KH>THE FALL OF ENRON</KH>
<HD>Powerful Figures Behind Firm's Rise--and Crash</HD>
<DH>Management: Enron executives built a small energy company into a
giant and have become focal points of inquiries into its collapse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They engineered financial deals that pushed accounting rules to the
limit. They saw markets to deregulate and harnessed the political muscle
to take them over.</LD>
<LD>   They dominated oil and gas trading markets and then branched out to
deal in everything from pollution credits to bets on the weather.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the best and brightest of Enron Corp.--a mostly young, well-paid
crowd that moved through energy and political circles with
confidence--are facing lawsuits, subpoenas and possibly criminal
indictments as Congress, federal agencies and regulators investigate the
biggest business collapse in U.S. history.</LD>
<TE>   With Enron's crash, the company's top brass largely has retreated to
plush Houston suburbs from Sugar Land to Bellaire to Humble and are
letting their lawyers do the talking while the investigations run their
course.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some of the key players in the Enron saga, current and former
executives who rode the rocket up and are expected to figure large in the
lawsuits and investigations triggered by the collapse.</TE>
<TE>Kenneth L. Lay</TE>
<TE>   Enron's 59-year-old chairman and chief executive, who resigned under
fire Wednesday, took a dinky natural gas pipeline firm and built it into
a powerhouse that was a new kind of energy company.</TE>
<TE>   Enron made its money not from pipelines and power plants, but by
trading natural gas and electricity and, eventually, a host of more
esoteric products such as water, financial havens from bad weather,
pollution credits, advertising and broadband Internet time, all supplied
by others.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a poor Missouri country preacher, Lay sermonized on the
benefits of bringing competition to a wide range of commodities. By
bringing together millions of buyers and sellers, Enron could squeeze out
the best prices and make a tidy profit. Supplies of electricity, for
example, and other commodities would be allocated more efficiently and
costs would be reduced.</TE>
<TE>   Lay, who has a doctorate in economics from the University of Houston,
saw the promise of natural gas deregulation in the 1980s and electricity
deregulation in the 1990s. Enriched by success, he became a big political
fund-raiser, an advisor to both Bush administrations and an architect of
national energy policy.</TE>
<TE>   In California, Lay tried to shape the state's deregulation policy in
the mid-1990s and then influence how the energy crisis was untangled.
Politicians and regulators lumped Enron in with a gang of out-of-state
energy companies accused of gouging California electricity users and
driving its two biggest electricity utilities to the edge of ruin.</TE>
<TE>   Lay's temper could be short and his memory long. Financial analyst
John Olson recently told a Houston audience that when he questioned the
value of Enron's assets last summer, Lay sent a note reading: "John Olson
has been wrong about Enron for over 10 years and he is still wrong. But
he is consistent." Olson framed the letter.</TE>
<TE>   Through Enron's stunning downward spiral, two views of Lay emerge: He
was an isolated statesman, insulated from financial trickery perpetrated
by underlings. Or he was a hands-on manager who knew what was going on.</TE>
<TE>   In Enron's restatement of earnings in November, slashing nearly $600
million from the bottom line over nearly five years, Lay kept up his
cheerleading in the face of mounting investor skepticism, saying the
company would continue its efforts "to respond to investor requests for
information about our operational and financial condition so they can
evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core
businesses."</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe he's a bumbling figurehead," an energy consultant said. "Or
maybe he just played the good old boy and he's the shrewdest guy on the
planet."</TE>
<TE>Jeffrey K. Skilling</TE>
<TE>   Skilling, a competitive bicycle rider, was on the ride of his life as
chief executive of Enron. But he stunned the energy industry Aug. 14 when
he resigned after only six months on the job.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling called it a "purely personal decision" that had "nothing to
do" with Enron, but many in and out of the company wondered why Skilling,
48, would walk away from a job he had long coveted.</TE>
<TE>   Lay brought Skilling to Enron in 1990 from the McKinsey &amp; Co.
consulting firm, where Skilling had handled the Enron account. Enron had
hit a rough patch because of plummeting natural gas prices, and Skilling
had a vision of Enron as a nimble trading company that didn't need hard
assets to make money.</TE>
<TE>   The company grew quickly under Lay and Skilling and constantly pushed
into new markets, including some that turned sour, such as a retail
energy venture, its water business, telecommunications and a huge power
project in India.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling, named president and a company director in 1996, was the
brash bad cop to Lay's good cop and corporate visionary role.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, an unfounded rumor swept Wall Street that oil giant Royal
Dutch/Shell Group would make a bid for Enron. Asked what he'd do if Shell
bought his company, Skilling shot back, "I'd run Shell."</TE>
<TE>   At that time, Enron was about one-fifth Shell's size.</TE>
<TE>   During a conference call last year with analysts and investors,
Skilling sparred with one analyst over murky financial disclosures. Then
Skilling abruptly cut off the man, calling him a vulgar name that
immediately buzzed through energy circles.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling, with the help of Andrew S. Fastow and others, created
off-balance-sheet financial deals that he insists were used to lower risk
for Enron and its shareholders. Critics have alleged that the
partnerships were used to hide losses and debt to boost earnings and
Enron's stock price.</TE>
<TE>   Even at the end, on the day he resigned, Skilling continued to sell
his version of Enron. Asked at a news conference whether any other shoes
were about to drop, Skilling replied, "There's nothing to disclose. The
company's in great shape."</TE>
<TE>   Now Skilling is "lying low," said one resident of River Oaks, a
Houston neighborhood dotted with socialites, where Skilling recently
finished construction on an opulent home for himself and his fiancee.</TE>
<TE>Andrew S. Fastow</TE>
<TE>   Enron's 40-year-old former chief financial officer was never flashy,
rarely giving interviews or making public appearances on behalf of the
company during his 11 years at Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow, who joined Enron in 1990 from Continental Bank in Chicago,
proved his worth in quiet ways, helping to raise the huge amounts of
capital that Enron needed in its quest to dominate new businesses. And he
helped engineer the murky off-the-books partnerships to boost the
company's financial performance and stock price. Such partnerships are
the subject of several federal investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow managed two of the partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2
Co-Investment, named using the initials of his three children. Investor
concern over potential conflicts between Fastow's role as Enron executive
and as partnership manager caused Fastow to resign his manager duties
last summer.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 16, Enron reported a surprise $638-million quarterly loss,
partly related to the partnerships that also cost the company $1.2
billion in shareholder equity. On Oct. 24, a day after Lay expressed "the
highest faith and confidence in Andy" during a conference call with
investors and analysts, Fastow was ousted from the job.</TE>
<TE>   Enron has said Fastow reaped at least $30 million in fees for managing
the partnerships. A Fastow spokesman said the arrangements were created
with the full knowledge and approval of Enron's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>Jeffrey McMahon</TE>
<TE>   McMahon, who took Fastow's spot as chief financial officer, was
mentioned in whistle-blower Sherron S. Watkins' Aug. 22 memo to Lay as
one of the top executives that Lay should quiz to see if her account of
financial shenanigans was true.</TE>
<TE>   McMahon, a former Andersen employee who joined Enron in 1994, was
treasurer and executive vice president of finance in 2000 when he
complained about the off-the-books deals that Fastow helped engineer.
McMahon then moved to an Enron backwater as president of a small
subsidiary that serves industrial customers.</TE>
<TE>   When Fastow's partnerships became the focus of investor ire, Lay
tapped McMahon as chief financial officer to calm things down. It didn't
work. With Lay's resignation, McMahon becomes a key officer at Enron and
the last of the company's three-person office of the chairman.</TE>
<TE>   McMahon, 41, built a new home about two years ago, valued at $872,700,
in the Houston enclave of Bellaire and is the father of two small
children.</TE>
<TE>Lawrence Whalley</TE>
<TE>   Whalley, Enron's 40-year-old president and chief operating officer,
also was one of those described by Watkins as having concerns about the
off-balance-sheet partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Whalley gained some notoriety this month when it was revealed that he
peppered a Bush administration official with pleas for help.</TE>
<TE>   Whalley called Peter Fisher, Treasury undersecretary for domestic
finance, six to eight times in October and November to persuade Fisher to
ask bankers to lend money to Enron. Fisher said he never called any
bankers about the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Whalley, who has a bachelor's degree from the U.S. Military Academy
and a master's in business administration from Stanford University,
joined Enron in 1992 as an associate in the finance division and worked
his way up through the risk management and natural gas trading
operations. In 1996, Whalley began running the European commodity-trading
divisions and later held top jobs at other Enron operations.</TE>
<TE>   Whalley was promoted to president and chief operating officer in late
August, two weeks after Skilling's resignation. Whalley recently agreed
to leave Enron for UBS Warburg to help run the energy trading business
that UBS is buying from Enron in a noncash, profit-sharing deal.</TE>
<TE>Sherron Smith Watkins</TE>
<TE>   Watkins, 42, was an Enron vice president who happened to work for
then-Chief Financial Officer Fastow last summer.</TE>
<TE>   What she learned in that assignment caused her to fire off an
anonymous letter Aug. 15 to Lay, followed by a memo Aug. 22, warning of a
possible corporate implosion if the details of suspect partnership deals
ever became known.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins' memo and meeting with Lay on Aug. 22 sparked a limited
investigation by outside counsel, but no action. Watkins' warnings,
released by congressional investigators last week, created an uproar
surrounding the churchgoing mother of a 2-year-old girl.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins began her first note to Lay with two prescient questions: "Has
Enron become a risky place to work? For those of us who didn't get rich
over the last few years, can we afford to stay?"</TE>
<TE>   Despite the uproar, Watkins continues to report daily to her job at
Enron.</TE>
<TE>Wendy Lee Gramm</TE>
<TE>   The 57-year-old wife of Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) has been an Enron
director since 1993 and is a member of its audit committee, giving her an
up-close look at Enron's accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Some see conflicts for Gramm because she also is director of the
Mercatus Center at George Mason University, which has received $50,000 in
contributions from Lay and others at Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Gramm headed the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission before she
joined Enron's board. Shortly before leaving the CFTC and joining Enron's
board, Gramm helped end regulation on many of the kinds of energy
contracts that Enron traded.</TE>
<TE>   Legislation backed in late 2000 by her husband excluded electronic
exchanges, such as Enron's online trading forum, from regulation by the
CFTC.</TE>
<TE>Richard A. Causey</TE>
<TE>   The 42-year-old Enron executive vice president and chief accounting
officer is mentioned in the Watkins letter to Lay. Watkins asked Lay to
sit down with Causey "and take a good hard objective look at what is
going to happen to Condor and Raptor [names of two off-balance-sheet
transactions] in 2002 and 2003."</TE>
<TE>   Before he joined Enron, Causey was a senior manager in Andersen's
Houston office, where he handled the Enron account. He holds a bachelor's
degree in business and accounting from the University of Texas at Austin.</TE>
<TE>James V. Derrick Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Derrick, 57, who joined Enron in 1991 and has been an executive vice
president and general counsel since July 1999, also appears in the
crucial Watkins letter.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins urged Lay to have Derrick hire a law firm to investigate the
Condor and Raptor projects but to avoid Vinson &amp; Elkins, one of Enron's
law firms, because it already had approved some of the transactions. V&amp;E
was hired and found no cause to investigate further.</TE>
<TE>Richard B. Buy</TE>
<TE>   The 49-year-old Enron executive vice president and chief risk officer
is in charge of "identifying, quantifying and controlling risks in both
Enron's trading activities and investment opportunities," according to
his corporate biography.</TE>
<TE>   Buy is responsible for managing Enron's investment portfolio "with the
goal of tracking investment returns and controlling exposures to various
risks."</TE>
<TE>   In Watkins' memo, Buy was one of five high-ranking Enron executives
identified as feeling discomfort with some of the controversial
off-the-books partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Buy joined Enron in April 1994, after working in energy lending and
trading at Bankers Trust. Buy's background is in mechanical engineering
and finance.</TE>
<TE>Mark E. Koenig</TE>
<TE>   Koenig, the 46-year-old executive vice president of investor
relations, is one of the five executives mentioned by Watkins as having
reservations about the partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Koenig is a member of the Enron management committee. He joined Enron
in 1985, the year it was formed, as director of Enron's pension and
profit-sharing investments.</TE>
<TE>   Koenig is a certified financial analyst. He is active in Sunshine
Kids, a Houston-based organization dedicated to children with cancer,
according to his corporate biography.</TE>

<TE>Kenneth L. Lay, 59</TE>
<TE>Former chairman and CEO</TE>
<TE>Lay resigned Wednesday after holding the top two positions at Enron
since 1986, except for a six-month period in 2001. He has been a
leading political fund-raiser and advisor to both Bush
administrations. Lay or Enron representatives met with Vice President
Dick Cheney or his energy task force several times last year.</TE>
<TE>*</TE>
<TE>Jeffrey K. Skilling, 48</TE>
<TE>Former president and CEO</TE>
<TE>Citing personal reasons, Skilling resigned in August after only six
months as Enron's chief executive and a long, lucrative career at the
company. His abrupt departure caused many to question why he would
walk away from a job he long coveted.</TE>
<TE>*</TE>
<TE>Andrew S. Fastow, 40</TE>
<TE>Former chief financial officer</TE>
<TE>One day after Lay expressed ``the highest confidence'' in him to
investors, Fastow was ousted from his job. He helped engineer and
reportedly reaped millions in profit from off-balance-sheet
partnerships that helped keep billions of dollars of debt off Enron's
books. Fastow was replaced by Jeffrey McMahon.</TE>
<TE>*</TE>
<TE>Jeffrey McMahon, 41</TE>
<TE>Chief financial officer</TE>
<TE>As Enron's treasurer, McMahon was ``highly vexed'' and complained to
Skilling about the partnerships in which Fastow was involved,
according to Watkins' memo. McMahon was reassigned to an Enron
subsidiary. As the off-the-books deals became the focus of investor
ire and government investigations, Lay tapped McMahon to replace
Fastow as CFO.</TE>
<TE>*</TE>
<TE>Richard A. Causey, 42</TE>
<TE>Executive vice president and chief accounting officer</TE>
<TE>Before joining Enron, Causey was a senior manager in Andersen's
Houston office with primary responsibility for the Enron account.
Causey reportedly downplayed many of the controversial Enron deals.</TE>
<TE>*</TE>
<TE>Lawrence ``Greg'' Whalley, 40</TE>
<TE>President and chief operating officer</TE>
<TE>Whalley made six to eight phone calls to Peter Fisher, Treasury
undersecretary for domestic finance, in October and early November
asking for help. But Fisher declined to intervene. Whalley will soon
leave Enron to help run the energy trading business that UBS Warburg
is buying from the company.</TE>
<TE>*</TE>
<TE>Wendy Lee Gramm, 57</TE>
<TE>Board member and member of the audit committee</TE>
<TE>Gramm, a strong supporter of deregulation, is the wife of Sen. Phil
Gramm (R-Texas). Before joining Enron's board, she headed the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, where she helped push through a
ruling that benefited Enron and other energy-trading companies.</TE>
<TE>*</TE>
<TE>Sherron Smith Watkins, 42</TE>
<TE>Her Aug. 22 memo to Lay has proved to be explosive and prescient. In
it, Watkins warned that the company's questionable financial
practices could lead to Enron's collapse and that the company's
success could come to be viewed as ``an elaborate accounting hoax.''

<HD>Army Secretary Takes On Afghan, Enron Wars</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Thomas White battles foes abroad. At home, his connection
to the energy giant is raising some questions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Army Secretary Thomas E. White is fighting battles on two fronts.
As his soldiers lead the ground war in Afghanistan, the former Enron
Corp. executive has found himself increasingly fielding uncomfortable
questions about his role in the energy company's sudden collapse.</LD>
<LD>   The public advocacy group Public Citizen, founded by activist Ralph
Nader, has suggested the Army secretary has engaged in a conflict of
interest by pursuing changes in Army energy policy that could have
benefited his former employer. White recused himself from dealing with
Army contracts involving Enron but continued to play a role in advocating
the privatization of energy services at Army installations, which employ
1.2 million soldiers and civilians on 15 million acres of land.</LD>
<LD>   After going from the Army, from which he retired in 1990 as a
brigadier general, to Enron and back, White argued that privatization
would trim costs from the department's $82-billion annual budget.</LD>
<TE>   "If indeed Enron was in a position to secure more contracts, clearly
there was a conflict of interest," said Tyler Slocum, Public Citizen's
research director for energy issues. "We know he headed up a division . .
. that was specifically targeting military installations to provide
utility services."</TE>
<TE>   White did not initiate the idea of privatizing energy services, said
Army spokeswoman Martha Rudd. Army officials did not return calls seeking
further comment.</TE>
<TE>   During his 11 years at Enron, White accrued millions of dollars in
company stock, more than any other administration official. Upon joining
the administration last May he sold the stock, as required by a
government ethics agreement, for $12.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   White held a litany of titles at the energy company. He was chairman
and chief executive of Enron Operations Corp. and was in charge of Enron
Engineering and Construction Co.</TE>
<TE>   And he was vice chairman of Enron Energy Services, which has been
criticized for accounting practices in which the division counted future
contracts as profits rather than waiting until the services were
delivered. Critics have said that those unusual accounting practices
contributed to the parent company's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "With the severe accounting problems going on at Enron, what was
Thomas White's knowledge of those practices within his division?" Slocum
asked.</TE>
<TE>   In a Jan. 22 response to a congressional inquiry from Rep. Henry A.
Waxman (D-Los Angeles), White acknowledged that he has had numerous phone
conversations and meetings with Enron employees since joining the
administration--and has discussed the company's plight with Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. But
he said the conversations were personal in nature, focusing on the effect
of the company's problems on him and his former co-workers.</TE>
<TE>   He said that he has participated in 23 phone calls and seven meetings
with Enron employees and that he initiated only two of the calls. White
said he called Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman, on Sept. 10 to wish him
luck as he took over additional duties as the company's chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   "At no time in any of these conversations or meetings did any one of
the Enron employees, to include Ken Lay, ask me to intercede in any way
with anyone to the potential benefit of Enron Corp.," White wrote.</TE>
<TE>   White said that, in brief conversations with Powell in December and
Rumsfeld in November, the focus was "a concern on their part for the
impact that the bankruptcy of Enron may have had on my personal
well-being. My response in both cases was that I had suffered significant
personal losses but that I would persevere."</TE>
<TE>   Phil Schiliro, Waxman's chief of staff, called White important to the
congressional investigations into Enron's collapse because of his
knowledge of the energy giant. But Schiliro said that the congressman,
the top Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee, is evaluating
White's response to questions about his contacts with Enron employees
after joining the administration.</TE>
<TE>   White is one of the few Bush administration officials so far to
respond to Waxman's request for details about contacts with Enron.
Schiliro complimented White for responding to Waxman's letter but said
the congressman will want to know more.</TE>
<TE>   "Secretary White may be one of the keys to understanding Enron," said
Schiliro. "It's very likely that congressional committees will want to
question him closely."</TE>
<TE>   White took pains to defend himself against any suggestion of
impropriety in the letter to Waxman, saying that, since joining the Bush
administration on May 31, he has bought no Enron stock, exercised no
options and "renounced" the options, now worthless, he did own.</TE>
<TE>   A financial disclosure report White filed May 4, 2001, said he held
from $25 million to $50 million in Enron stock, $25 million to $50
million in stock options, a "phantom" stock award--a future bonus of
appreciated stock--of $5 million to $25 million, an employee stock
ownership plan worth $1 million to $5 million and a retirement account
worth $100,000 to $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   White converted his cash retirement account into an annuity that pays
$1,061.50 a month. But while an outside trust continues to pay its share,
$372.51, White said, Enron has not paid the remaining $688.99 since
declaring bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Since joining the administration, he has sold 405,710 shares of Enron
stock for a total of $12.1 million, which dropped in value from $50.35 a
share June 13, the date of his first sale, to $12.85 a share Oct. 30, the
date of his last.</TE>

<HD>A Feeling of Disbelief and Betrayal in a City Known for Boom and
Bust</HD>
<DH>Enron: All over Houston, they're saying the company's euphoric
years were a facade, lies, a house of cards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>The woman in high heels and dark glasses stood on the brink of the
road, chin thrust high, cardboard hoisted aloft for all of rush hour to
read: "Ex-Enron employee. Will work for fair salary and benefits. Seeking
a company with integrity."</LD>
<LD>   This parkway twists from the marble and ivy of the well-heeled River
Oaks enclave down to the shadows of downtown's skyscrapers. A few hours
after sunrise, it stood thick with the sedans of energy barons,
receptionists and lawyers.</LD>
<LD>   When they read Sonia Garcia's sign, the white-collar parade broke into
grins, slapped staccato toots from their horns, thrust their thumbs
skyward. The 38-year-old single mother was a hit. But then, it isn't hard
to win over a Houston audience these days--just grumble about Enron Corp.</LD>
<TE>   The energy company's financial meltdown has left an entire town angry,
cuckolded and saddened. The apparent suicide of Enron executive J.
Clifford Baxter falls in a winter already heavy with empty pockets,
evictions and jobless afternoons.</TE>
<TE>   "These people's lives are coming unraveled all over the place," Rice
University sociologist Stephen Klineberg said. "This was a horrible
betrayal of the workers, and a horrible betrayal of the city."</TE>
<TE>   Gone are the euphoric years of handshakes and hype, of baseball at
dusk and black ties by night. Enron has proved just one more spectacular
boom and bust in a city long defined by dizzy rise and devastating
collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody wanted to work there. I was so proud when I got the job,"
Garcia said. The graphic artist hasn't worked in weeks, not since Enron
gave her half an hour to abandon her desk. Now, she's wondering how
she'll make mortgage payments on her two-story house.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all a facade," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Facade. Lies. House of cards. Those words are sounding all over
Houston. People who had no connection to the company say they are ashamed
of its behavior. Former workers fret over whether to list Enron on their
resumes. A sense that the city's reputation has been bruised hangs over a
town already struggling with ugly-duckling syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, it tarnishes the entire city, it plays on the psyche,"
said George Fleming, a lawyer who represents hundreds of shareholders and
former employees in a suit against Enron. "They were so connected. People
go, 'Oh, yeah, Enron, that's Houston."'</TE>
<TE>   In real numbers, Enron was never crucial--far from it. It was 7,500
jobs in a city of 4 million people. Fewer than half of this town's
workers have so much as a glancing relation to the energy industry.</TE>
<TE>   But psychologically, symbolically, Enron had no equal. Its name graced
the polished trestles of the new baseball stadium. Cash from the company
laced the fine and performing arts, and kept charities afloat. It was no
secret that Kenneth L. Lay was one of George W. Bush's most lavish
benefactors, and a longtime supporter of the elder George Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Enron sold energy, but represented power. It was a floor crowded with
traders, a new way to get rich, a skyscraper full of ideas nobody else
had dreamed up. Enron told this infant metropolis it was the center of a
new economy, and eagerly Houston believed.</TE>
<TE>   Then the story changed. The lies started rolling. The no-can-lose
stock got sick and withered. Enron declared bankruptcy on a Sunday. On
Monday, bosses rode the elevators down with grim news, and massive
layoffs swept Enron's offices. Furious workers stumbled from the building
with laptops and ergonomic chairs in tow. That was nearly two months ago,
and the sting has barely faded.</TE>
<TE>   "Even as the weeks go by, there is still a sense of disbelief and
betrayal," said Sue Cruver, a spokeswoman for the WorkSource, an
employment firm that's trolling for jobs for more than 1,000 displaced
Enron workers. "There's a feeling that those responsible should, and
will, pay."</TE>
<TE>Day by Day, Spirits Sink</TE>
<TE>   Every day, it seems, the treachery deepens. As newspapers hit the
stoop each morning splashed with new scrap of scandal, spirits sink a
little lower.</TE>
<TE>   "It starts to get next to you," said JoAnn Matson, a 40-year-old Enron
worker laid off in December. "Every time you think it can't get any
worse, there's some new document shredding or criminal activity. It makes
you want to wash your hands."</TE>
<TE>   This last week began with tales of destroyed documents, and ended with
the discovery of Baxter's body. His Mercedes was parked up the street
from his suburban home. A suicide note and a revolver were dropped at his
side.</TE>
<TE>   "It was tragic in the first place. This is just another tragedy,"
Terry Slater said. The owner of a Houston marketing firm, Slater bought
the Baxter family's two-story house when the clan moved across town to a
tonier neighborhood. "It's an indication of how bad it is."</TE>
<TE>   Few Houstonians are able to articulate just what Enron was up to.
Still, there was vague confidence in the enterprise. Inside its looming
downtown offices, it was generally understood, Lay and his squad of
wheelers, dreamers and weathermen were outsmarting the rest of the
country.</TE>
<TE>   It was odd, really--the company hadn't been around too long. Enron was
born in 1985, when Houston Natural Gas merged with a Nebraska natural gas
company. But suddenly, in the 1990s, the name was all over town.</TE>
<TE>   Enron meant a lot to a town that spent more than 20 years swelling and
suffering at the caprices of the oil market. It meant that the demise of
the old oil business didn't necessarily sound a death knell for a
metropolis baptized in crude. It was a symbol that this city could smooth
out, grow up--and remain an energy capital.</TE>
<TE>   Reliant, Dynegy, El Paso. They call them the Louisiana Street Mafia,
call this strip of concrete Energy Alley. Commuters can watch the price
of power run in rivers of red light on a market ticker. Enron presided to
the south, envied and awesome. At dusk the young traders burst into the
city from a day spent peddling industrial lifeblood across the country.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Enron Field rose up, a hunk of gleaming glass and steel
dividing downtown from the patch of refineries to the east. The season
opener was the most popular event that spring: Houston came out in droves
to watch Lay throw out the first pitch to the warm applause of the elder
and younger Bushes. Months passed. George W. Bush made good in the
national elections, Enron stock prices climbed ever higher and Houston
felt itself at the axis of something rich and sturdy.</TE>
<TE>   "The word on the street was it was the best company to work for,"
Matson said. "I mean, people--any time I went somewhere it was, 'Oh, God,
you work for Enron? Can I give you my resume?' People admired us, they
envied us."</TE>
<TE>   A divorced mother of two, Matson walked out of a permanent position
with PricewaterhouseCoopers when Enron offered her a temporary job in the
human resources department. That gave way to a permanent spot, and after
a year Matson had made up her mind: She'd retire from Enron or win the
lottery, whichever came first. She figures she lost $85,000 to her
once-beloved company.</TE>
<TE>   Going broke on a bad--but bold--roll is still an act of grace in a
city streaked with gambler's ethos. It isn't the financial fall that
galls Houston. It's the humiliation of being fooled by a benefactor.</TE>
<TE>   "This thing with Enron makes me furious," Jim McIngvale said. Better
known as "Mattress Mac," McIngvale is emblematic of old-time Houston
business: He rolled into town 20 years ago with empty pockets and built a
furniture empire from Texas pine and oil boom cash. "They've hoodwinked
the entire city. They ought to be ashamed of themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Enron's swan dive is a wallop to a town that stakes its faith in
industry, free enterprise and entrepreneurship. "If you can't make it in
Houston," people here sometimes quip, "you're not trying."</TE>
<TE>   They call it Boomtown, USA, for one simple, slick reason: Texas crude.
Back in 1981, oil sucked more than 1,000 newcomers to town every week.
They came from Michigan, Pennsylvania, Illinois, lured by warm climes and
the promise of a steady paycheck. Every day, 230 more cars and trucks
rolled onto Harris County's roadways.</TE>
<TE>   When the frenzy bottomed out, it happened fast. In 1982, the price of
crude tumbled--and took Houston along for the fall. By 1987, this
landscape of bayous and billboards had sunk into the nation's worst
regional recession since World War II.</TE>
<TE>Enron Was Emblematic of the New Houston</TE>
<TE>   It is this history that haunts Houston--and grounds it. No downfall,
conventional wisdom dictates, will ever compare to what this town has
already suffered.</TE>
<TE>   "The 1982 collapse was so profound, so devastating, so
world-changing," Klineberg said, "that nothing like this means as much
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   It's not the end of the world, everybody says. We've seen worse. But
therein lies the rub: Enron was emblematic of the new Houston, a city
that would profit from energy in the abstract. The industry that would
stand sturdy in the face of progress. "It was the brave new world," said
Rice University social sciences dean Robert M. Stein. "They were dealing
in intangibles."</TE>
<TE>   Now, the Enron sitting rooms and conference tables are ghostly. The
company can't pay for the 40-story tower it was erecting across the
street from the original offices. Once a monument to Enron's rocketing
status, the shell of a building is a sore reminder of the company's fall
from grace.</TE>
<TE>   Spring is coming, but nobody can be sure how much longer the Astros'
home will bear the Enron name.</TE>
<TE>   "If they leave Enron Field named Enron Field this year, I'm not going
to a single game," McIngvale said. "I don't care if they're paid up or
not.</TE>
<TE>   "They ought to call it Texas Field or Houston Field or anything else
after the way they treated their employees."</TE>

<HD>House Walks Fine Line on Finance Reform Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Almost all politicians here profess generic support for campaign
finance reform. But getting them to endorse--and actually vote
for--specific proposals can be a slippery task.</LD>
<LD>   Well aware of this, the advocates of a House bill to limit big-money
donations redoubled their efforts Friday to firm up their fragile
bipartisan coalition. The mobilization came after the success Thursday of
their petition drive to force a House vote on the reform issue.</LD>
<LD>   Reps. Martin T. Meehan (D-Mass.) and Christopher Shays (R-Conn.),
chief sponsors of the reform bill pending in the House, acknowledged that
winning the petition signatures of 218 lawmakers did not mean they have
locked up that many votes for the measure itself.</LD>
<TE>   "They're not necessarily committed to voting for final passage,"
Meehan said of the signers. "This is about getting a bill to the floor."</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Rep. Corrine Brown (D-Fla.), who provided signature No.
217, said her vote still is in play. She said she would like to add to
the bill provisions that would encourage voter turnout.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Shays predicted that some lawmakers who refused to
sign the petition--in part because it is a parliamentary device that
undercuts House leaders--would end up supporting the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation's main provision would ban so-called soft money--the
unlimited and largely unregulated contributions to political parties.
These donations now total hundreds of millions of dollars every year, and
reform advocates argue that the money allows corporations, businesses and
wealthy individuals to exert undue influence over the political process.</TE>
<TE>   Similar versions of the Shays-Meehan measure have passed the House
twice, most recently in 1999. But the outcome of this year's debate
remains clouded.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 252 representatives who supported the 1999 reform bill, 226
still are in the House. Many of them signed the petition to call up the
bill, but some did not.</TE>
<TE>   Also, it appears that some lawmakers are preparing to vote against the
bill, even though they co-sponsored past versions of it.</TE>
<TE>   During the previous debates in the late 1990s, it was clear that the
bills the House passed would die in the Senate. But in April, the Senate
passed a sweeping reform bill written by Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and
Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.). The prospect that a reform bill might
actually become law caused some House members to reconsider their support
for the movement.</TE>
<TE>   What seems certain is that leaders of the House Republican
majority--most prominently Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas--will try
mightily to defeat the Shays-Meehan bill. The GOP leaders were not
available for comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican leaders oppose the drive to abolish soft-money
contributions, arguing that such a ban would infringe on constitutionally
protected free speech. That argument and others were being revived this
week.</TE>
<TE>   "I would rather defeat so-called campaign finance reform than pass
legislation that . . . obliterates the political parties and hinders
crucial get-out-the-vote efforts, which are so important to the American
election process," said Rep. Robert W. Ney (R-Ohio), chairman of the
House Administration Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The Shays-Meehan bill differs in some relatively minor ways from the
Senate bill. That means that if the House passes the Shays-Meehan
measure, the Senate in all likelihood would be forced to vote again on
the reform issue.</TE>
<TE>   Despite last year's Senate vote, passage of a reform bill a second
time would be no sure thing.</TE>
<TE>   Under Senate rules, the bill could be subject to a filibuster,
requiring 60 votes to break. Last year, McCain and Feingold appeared to
have that level of support; whether that has changed this year remains to
be seen.</TE>

<HD>Bus Driver to Undergo Psychiatric Evaluation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA
</DL>
<LD>A school bus driver accused of taking 13 children on a curious
160-mile "field trip" with a rifle next to him appeared in court on
kidnapping charges Friday and was ordered to undergo a psychiatric
evaluation.</LD>
<LD>   Police also disclosed that they found 48 weapons in Otto Nuss' house,
including a dozen handguns, as well as 75 rounds of ammunition on the
bus.</LD>
<LD>   At an appearance in federal court in Philadelphia, Nuss, 63, was
ordered jailed for a hearing next week. Asked about his mental
competence, Public Defender Felicia Sarner said: "I think there are
clearly issues that need to be developed here."</LD>
<TE>   Nuss surrendered Thursday just outside Washington after a six-hour
odyssey during which he told the youngsters on his bus that he was taking
them on a field trip to the nation's capital instead of delivering them
to their Pennsylvania private school.</TE>
<TE>   A friend said Nuss had been treated for psychiatric problems but had
recently stopped taking his medication. He said Nuss collected guns.</TE>
<TE>   School officials said this was Nuss' first year driving a bus for them
and that he had passed criminal background and child-abuse checks.
However, neither check looks into an applicant's mental health history.</TE>
<TE>   In Pennsylvania, the Rev. Jim Smith offered prayers for Nuss at the
service at a church next to the Berks Christian School in Birdsboro,
northwest of Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, he is alone in a jail," Smith said. Students nodded in
agreement, then bowed their heads in prayer as Smith talked about Nuss.
"He really needs people to be praying for him."</TE>
<TE>   About 200 students, including at least three who had been aboard the
bus, attended the service, school administrator Robert Becker said.</TE>
<TE>   The bus had picked up the students, ages 7 to 15, in Oley on Thursday
morning for their daily six-mile trip to the school. When the bus failed
to reach its destination, residents, a police helicopter and cruisers
frantically searched the route. The trip ended at a discount store in
Lanham, Md., where Nuss surrendered to an off-duty police officer.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he wanted to show them Washington, D.C.," FBI spokesman Peter
Gulotta Jr. said.</TE>
<TE>   Students said they knew he had a gun behind his seat, but they played
games, helped Nuss plan the route and felt at ease when he stopped the
bus to treat them to lunch at a Burger King.</TE>
<TE>   "He never touched anybody," said eighth-grader Josh Pletscher, 13. "We
were having fun. We were having cars honk their horns."</TE>
<TE>   Pletscher said that Nuss never touched the gun during the trip.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GROTON, N.H.
</DL>
<LD>Groton's three town managers can start talking to one another
again.</LD>
<LD>   At the town's request, a judge Friday modified her earlier order
barring the selectmen from speaking to one another while two of them face
criminal charges. Prosecutors had asked for the ban to prevent collusion
or witness-tampering.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Jean Burling relaxed the order to allow the three selectmen to
hold meetings as long as the proceedings are taped and held in public,
and the selectmen never discuss the criminal case.</LD>
<TE>   The ban, imposed Tuesday, had put Groton in a fix. Most day-to-day
business in this town of 456 people continued, but all Board of Selectmen
meetings were canceled until further notice and some bills went unpaid
because checks need the signatures of two selectmen.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Pilcher and Deb Johnson are accused of illegally trying to get
extra money for the town from the federal government after a big
snowstorm last winter. They have denied the charges.</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana Stage Company's 'Hamlet' Comest in Such a Questionable
Shape</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coming soon to a theater near you: See the birth of Hamlet, prince
of Denmark. And what a lovely baby girl she is.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Ana's Hunger Artists Theatre Company always has enjoyed putting
twists into the classics, and it has a radical one in mind for the first
Shakespeare play in its five-year history. In this "Hamlet," running
April 26-May 19, we will meet a prince who is really a princess--but who
has been posing as a male all her life.</LD>
<LD>   Director John Beane plans to present the subterfuge in an opening
montage that shows Queen Gertrude giving birth. In Beane's conception,
King Hamlet (later to appear as the ghost of the murdered king) is
obsessed with producing a male heir; presented with a baby girl, he
simply has her spirited away and raised as a boy, unbeknownst to her
mother and everybody else in the play. Beane, a Fullerton resident, says
he hatched the idea over the last two years with friend  Jesse Runde, the
actress who will play Hamlet.</LD>
<TE>   It brings a new level to [Hamlet's] denial of Ophelia, to her vehement
attitude with Gertrude, and to her constant questioning of herself, her
identity problems, her basic unwillingness to fight," says Beane. "It's
going to be dark, moody and philosophical."</TE>
<TE>   Although "Hamlet" is a Hunger Artists show, Beane is renting out the
Hunger Artists space for the Feb. 8-March 2 run of another Shakespeare
play, "Henry V." It is being produced by his own fledging company, the
Insurgo Theatre Movement. Beane, 26, and his actress wife, Jessica, 24,
are launching Insurgo mainly with their own savings. The two met while
acting in a Huntington Beach Playhouse Shakespeare-in-the-Park production
of "Love's Labour's Lost." She is about to earn a degree in literature at
Cal State Fullerton; he helps run Mad Science, an Anaheim company that
offers after-school science programs.</TE>
<TE>   The Beanes are searching for a warehouse-type space in north Orange
County and hope to present a full season of plays starting in August.
Insurgo, says Beane, is Latin for "to rebel, to expand, to ascend. I want
the name to remind us to be constantly aggressive and expand our
horizons. Obviously none of us is in it for the cash. We want to beat our
heads against the stage and make some art." On the agenda, he says, are
more classics, popular contemporary plays such as "Amadeus" and new
works, including a rock opera called "Heaven's Cafe." Another title,
"Theseus and the Minotaur" is a fresh take on the Greek myth written by
the Beanes.</TE>
<TE>   "Henry V" will be fairly straightforward, a period dress-up piece set
in the milieu of 15th century England and France. But Beane's staging
introduces a new character--a scribe struggling to make sense of the
heroic monarch while chronicling his deeds, thereby serving as an onstage
surrogate for the audience. Beane promises knights in armor fighting
heated battles. The big experiment, be says, is to see what happens when
one of Shakespeare's most epic plays unfolds practically within arm's
reach of the audience. Insurgo's "Henry V" will run Fridays and Saturdays
at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 7 p.m. (714) 870-0598.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of female Hamlets, the attitude of the American Shakespeare
theater establishment seems to be "why not?" At least that was the
feeling Thomas F. Bradac, leader of Shakespeare Orange County, got while
presiding last weekend over the annual conference of the Shakespeare
Theatre Assn. of America. Bradac, the association's president, said that
115 representatives from 42 Shakespeare theaters attended, the gathering
in Washington, D.C. The consensus was that it is fitting for actresses to
tackle one of Shakespeare's meatiest parts, whether posing as a prince or
playing Hamlet as a princess.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a general sense not that it is just in vogue to do it, but
that it brings a different richness to the play itself," Bradac said.
"We've changed as a society,  and it allows us to, look at the play
through different eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Bradac, who began producing Shakespeare in Orange County 23 years ago,
has something new in mind for this year. He plans an effort to get
youngsters stoked on Shakespeare. Bradac thinks kids get turned off
because they first encounter the Bard as just another reading assignment.
His plan, The Shakespeare Project, calls for students from the fourth and
fifth grades to act in scenes from Shakespeare plays. "I want a program
that gets kids up on their feet and excited about language," says Bradac,
a theater professor at Chapman University. "I would like to personalize
it in some ways so they don't feel it's a marble statue they're supposed
to like. It's fun. It's sex and violence. Shakespeare was a guy talking
about the things people are always interested in, and we need to unlock
that. If you approach it as 'This is great poetry,' you're going to lose
them,"</TE>
<TE>   The task Bradac has set for himself is to develop ways to train
teachers and theater professionals so they can bring Shakespeare alive in
classrooms--and to raise the $25,000 he thinks he needs to get The
Shakespeare Project ready in time for the next school year.</TE>
<TE>   Good reviews have not translated into good box office for "Bash,"
running at Hunger Artists through Feb. 3. Neil Labute's string of three
one-act monologues is a dark exploration of how ordinary, seemingly
decent people can commit unspeakable acts against innocents. A total of
40 customers bought tickets for the three performances last weekend, says
Mark Palkoner, Hunger Artists' co-managing director. Palkoner thinks the
post-Sept. 11 mood has suppressed the public's appetite for ultra-dark
stuff. "Bash" plays Fridays and Saturdays at 8:30 p.m. and Sundays at
7:30 p.m., with an additional performance Monday at 8:30 p.m. (714)
547-9100.</TE>
