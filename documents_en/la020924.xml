<LD>KNBC-TV killed the suspense for some local viewers of Sunday's Emmy
Awards, who figured out that "The West Wing" was named best drama
about 20 minutes before that category was televised.</LD>
<LD>   That's because KNBC-TV teased its late newscast during the
delayed-for-the-West Coast broadcast and, in a series of shots from
the awards, included series creator Aaron Sorkin holding his award
amid some "West Wing" cast members.</LD>
<LD>   A spokeswoman for the station said Monday that the brief clip's
inclusion was an "editing oversight." Sorkin wasn't identified during
the promotion.</LD>

<HD>At 58, Deneuve Is Savoring the Role of Working Actress</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CLARK</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>During the film festival here last week, the lobby of the Four
Seasons Hotel was lousy with movie stars--so much so that patrons
barely bothered to look when one strolled by. And then Catherine
Deneuve walked into the room. The same jaded people leaned in her
direction like plants following sunlight. She settled in a restaurant
bar, lighted a cigarette and ordered a sherbet. She was dressed head
to toe in Chanel.</LD>
<LD>   "I am used to being recognized," she says in a voice that's almost
as familiar as her face.</LD>
<LD>   So are a lot of stars. But Deneuve is a special case. Her likeness
is the model for Marianne, symbol of the French Republic on coins and
stamps. It's hard to imagine any American performer achieving that
status. In fact, for all of our obsession with celebrity, Americans
make a distinction between stardom and something deeper, more
representative of the country or culture. How do you live up to that?</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's very tiring to be Catherine Deneuve each day," says
Francois Ozon, who directed her in his new film "8 Women," which
opened in Los Angeles on Friday after screening at the film festival
here earlier this month.. "I wouldn't like to be Catherine Deneuve
each day because she's an icon for the French cinema, for the French
beauty. Day after day would be heavy to be that."</TE>
<TE>   In "8 Women," Deneuve plays the mother of two daughters, one grown
(Virginie Ledoyen), one almost (Ludivine Sagnier). Rounding out the
cast of characters who live at or are visiting her storybook country
house are her sister (Isabelle Huppert), her mother (Danielle
Darrieux), her chambermaid (Emmanuelle Beart), her housekeeper
(Firmine Richard) and her husband's sister (Fanny Ardant). There is
another occupant, Deneuve's husband, but when he is found dead, it
becomes clear that one of these women did him in. Each has a motive,
but it doesn't really matter. The real point is that under one roof
are three generations of French actresses who get to pout, scream,
cry, dance, sing (and kiss!).</TE>
<TE>   The movie is a souffle that only Deneuve could hold together. "I
realized when I began to work on the script that she had to play the
part of Gaby because she is the heart of the film," says Ozon, who
with Marina De Van adapted a little-appreciated French play. "It was
a film about character but also about actresses too, and she is the
most important French actress for 50 years. When she accepted, it was
very easy to build a cast around her."</TE>
<TE>   In spite of reservations she had about the potentially
misogynistic nature of the source material and the selfishness of her
character, Deneuve took the part because she is an admirer of Ozon's
work ("Water Drops on Burning Rocks," "Under the Sand") and she liked
the originality of the concept.</TE>
<TE>   "It was funny to be working with eight actresses in a play like
that," Deneuve says. "Most of the time what I'm offered is a
character of my age in relation with people or friends or work, like
in life. This was a more original story. He has a very strong
personality, and [I thought] he would be able to handle all that."</TE>
<TE>   He does and he did, but perhaps not in a way she might have liked,
at least according to Ozon. He says she was very easy, uncompetitive,
almost maternal with the other actresses, but missed the kind of
close working relationship she likes to have with a director.</TE>
<TE>   "She wants to be very close to you, and this was not easy for me
because I had eight personalities in front of me," he says. "I had to
be neutral because I didn't want to give privilege. I think it was a
little difficult for Catherine because if we had been alone, it would
have been more comfortable for her and for me. She needs, like many
actors, to love the character. She didn't understand the direction of
the character because she's not like this in life."</TE>
<TE>   Normally this wouldn't matter, except that in "8 Women" Deneuve is
playing a version of herself. Ozon is quite aware of who that person
is. He seems to know her life and career in much the same way a
schoolboy knows the life and deeds of some grand historical figure.
He knows the movies she's made (among the most famous: "The Umbrellas
of Cherbourg," "Repulsion," "Belle de Jour," "The Last Metro") and
the directors she's worked with (Jacques Demy, Luis Bunuel, Francois
Truffaut). Now he's become acquainted with the person behind the
postage stamp.</TE>
<TE>   "People have an image of Catherine as very cold, but in life she's
very hot," he says. "She's alive. She's not an icon in life. She
knows things, and she's very clever. I think she's very shy. She
tries to protect herself a lot."</TE>
<TE>   This may be, but she does seem comfortable in her own skin. She
has a dry sense of humor and a lively interest in things other than
herself. She's most analytical in her assessment of where she is at
this point in her career. At 58, she is no longer young, a fact she
freely acknowledges, though it's not the handicap in France that it
is in the United States. The French venerate their older actresses.</TE>
<TE>   "In America, it's not very easy to grow old, eh?" she says. "It
must be terrifying to fear something that you cannot fight. It's
something that's so related to life. Of course there are moments
where it's not that nice. But to be in such denial of maturity is
very strange."</TE>
<TE>   Her personal life is as much a part of her mythology as her
professional life is. Deneuve, who is divorced from photographer
David Bailey, has two children, Christian Vadim (by director Roger
Vadim) and Chiara Mastroianni (by the late actor Marcello
Mastroianni). She lives in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Deneuve says she would love to work with such American directors
as Paul Thomas Anderson, Francis Ford Coppola, Jonathan Demme, Martin
Scorsese and Jim Jarmusch, but she understands there is not much call
for middle-aged French actresses in their films. She also understands
that it is a challenge for European directors to cast her because she
brings so much baggage to a role.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, she notes that the first 15 minutes of a film are
critical in making the audience forget who she is, a task at which
some directors have failed. In fact, a few critics contended that is
exactly what happened in 2000's "Dancer in the Dark," in which
director Lars von Trier cast her as a factory worker. But she insists
that she was believably blue-collar in that movie (which is
different, she adds, than saying she was good in it).</TE>
<TE>   It may be that she continues to work and stay relevant because she
has not been paralyzed by stardom and lost touch with her instincts,
as sometimes happens to her American counterparts. Imagine an
American performer of her magnitude singing, dancing and enjoying a
lesbian kiss, as Deneuve does in "8 Women." As for why she keeps
acting, she says, "I need to work because I need to be involved. You
meet people, you have projects, you have them develop, it works, it
doesn't work. It's like walking. It's a way of living for me."</TE>

<HD>Longer 'Amadeus' Back for an Encore</HD>
<DH>Movies* A director's cut of the 1984 Oscar-winning best
picture is being released on DVD with 20 minutes of footage not seen
in the original release.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DESOWITZ</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last spring, when Warner Home Video announced that it was releasing a
director's cut of "Amadeus" on DVD (after a limited theatrical run),
many observers assumed it was purely a marketing ploy to capitalize
on the success of "Apocalypse Now Redux." Not so, according to
producer Saul Zaentz and director Milos Forman.</LD>
<LD>   It turns out that when a French distributor approached Zaentz
about a theatrical reissue of "Amadeus," the filmmakers thought it
was time to revisit their original version, which contained 20
minutes of footage that were trimmed before the film's release.</LD>
<LD>   While not as jarring or as controversial as "Apocalypse Now
Redux," the "Amadeus" director's cut (which premieres today on DVD in
a two-disc special edition as part of a new vintage and contemporary
classics brand) certainly offers a more leisurely pace as well as
expanded characterizations of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (played by Tom
Hulce) and his ditzy wife Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge). There's
even a tad more of F. Murray Abraham's jealous and conniving
composer, Antonio Salieri, who first plots the murder of his idol,
then winds up assisting him with his Requiem Mass on his deathbed.</LD>
<TE>   What is historically significant about this director's cut,
however, is that an eight-time Oscar winner is being revised, not
some maligned orphan film or fascinating failure. Which means that
whatever we think about the merits of this new "Amadeus," it is not
the same film that took home the best-picture prize in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   "Back in '84, we sat around with some friends and screened the
rough cut of 'Amadeus,' " Zaentz recalls. "It was three hours long,
and they suggested that we cut it down for commercial reasons."</TE>
<TE>   Forman concurs that they panicked: "We were already in trouble ...
with no stars, classical music and a period drama. We felt that we
were testing the audience's patience too long, so we cut anything
that didn't push the plot forward."</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to comprehend this kind of insecurity from the same
producing-directing team that had scored a best-picture triumph a
decade earlier with "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" (which also
comes to DVD this week as part of the same classics brand from Warner
Home Video). But nobody anticipated what an impact "Amadeus" would
have on viewers back then, least of all Orion, the original
distributor, which treated it like an art film.</TE>
<TE>   However, "Amadeus," which Peter Shaffer adapted from his smash
London and Broadway play, caught on because it was both fresh and
retro. The musical thriller combined old-fashioned Hollywood glam
with a contemporary punk sensibility. Hulce portrayed Mozart as if he
were the world's first rock star--a vulgar genius whom audiences
loved to hate. And Abraham played Salieri as if he were a tired old
mainstream rival who wasn't hip enough to stay on the charts. Of
course, the film had its share of detractors who detested the vulgar
depiction of Mozart and the way the story played fast and loose with
history. Yet it was never the intention to make a traditional biopic.</TE>
<TE>   "Milos and I were totally in sync," Zaentz says. "We both agreed
that to make this work as a movie, it needed more Mozart and more
music. I thought it would be too distracting to cast stars, and Milos
agreed with me."</TE>
<TE>   So when it came time to consider the longer version--which now
carries an R rating because of nudity on the part of
Berridge--Zaentz, Forman and Shaffer huddled in a screening room and
gave it another look. "The decision had to be unanimous--and it was,"
Zaentz says. "With a few minor trims, we went back to the original
version we had liked all along."</TE>
<TE>   Included is a more complex and provocative seduction between
Salieri and Constanze, which accounts for her hatred of the composer
and her melancholy mood the following morning, as well as a
humiliating moment in which Mozart must beg for a tutoring
job--Hulce's favorite scene, according to the director. There's even
a sly scene in which the gleeful Salieri introduces a humbled Mozart
to Italian ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   "The scenes between Constanze and Mozart are richer and more
emotionally understandable, and we now see a little more of Mozart's
decline," Forman adds. "It seems right."</TE>
<TE>   Zaentz isn't sure if they unduly panicked in '84, but he is glad
they took the opportunity to provide a new experience that looks and
sounds better than ever. All of the tweaking, remixing and
remastering were done at the producer's Zaentz Film Center in
Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Amadeus' is one of these films that everyone felt blessed to be
working on," says Tom Christopher, the picture restoration editor who
served on the sound crew in '84. "Milos wanted everything you could
put into it. Not having seen the film in a long time, what strikes
you is how much detail is on screen. It was shocking.</TE>
<TE>   "We found all of the elements and weren't sure if they were stored
properly and would print correctly. All the prints we had were faded,
and Saul and Milos were very good at remembering the way it was
supposed to look. They didn't go for a new look. Fortunately, the
negative was shot beautifully and has a rich look. We blended the new
pieces in and made sharp, clean masters for the DVD."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Zaentz and Forman revisited "One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest" but resisted adding any new footage to their first
collaboration. "I'm not interested in altering any of my other
films," Forman says. "This was a special case where we thought it
worked better and would now be better appreciated by the audience. In
the case of 'Cuckoo's Nest,' there were never any reservations about
the final cut, and we stand by it today."</TE>

<HD>A Mixed Bag of Americana Music at the Bowl</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Usually "The Star-Spangled Banner" stands alone at the top of a
Hollywood Bowl concert, musically unrelated to anything that goes on
afterward.</LD>
<LD>   But not at the annual American Winds program led by Larry Curtis
on Saturday night, when the embattled anthem served as exactly the
right lead-in for the "National Emblem" march--which uses the same
tune--as well as a program of diverse Americana titled "Strike Up the
Band!"</LD>
<LD>   Yet it was a patchy evening of music, with passages when the pace
slackened dangerously, not helped by the muffled, murky sound through
much of the first half.</LD>
<TE>   A lyrical Frank Ticheli tone poem based on "Shenandoah" was
succeeded by pure corn on the cob from the Disneyland Main Street
Merchants Assn. Municipal Brass Band.</TE>
<TE>   A pro forma potpourri of "West Side Story" tunes gave way to a
fairly inventive Ellington medley that occasionally had the buzz of
the original band.</TE>
<TE>   Former Dodger skipper Tommy Lasorda, who turned 75 on Sunday,
stepped up to the plate to narrate Steven Reinecke's over-the-top
setting of "Casey at the Bat," but play was halted in mid-performance
when some pages in the script were apparently mixed up.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, it was good to hear irreverent things, like Charles
Ives' collision of several village bands, "Country Band
March"--though the performance seemed a bit timid--Ira Hearshen's
cleverly scored Divertimento for Band, and a Hearshen quodlibet that
made a funny metaphor about sharks in show biz by combining "There's
No Business Like Show Business" with the theme from "Jaws."</TE>
<TE>   And the evening was topped off by one of the noisiest outbursts of
fireworks yet, done to the George and Ira Gershwin tune that gave the
program its name.</TE>

<LD>Having heard I was at the Toronto Film Festival, a studio executive
started grilling me about what filmmakers had the biggest buzz coming
out of there. As the conversation wore on, it became apparent that he
wasn't interested in the filmmakers with the biggest buzz, he was
interested only in the young filmmakers with the biggest buzz.</LD>
<LD>   In Hollywood, the fountain of youth has become a bottomless pit.
Studio executives throw money at Vin Diesel, Colin Farrell and any
other hip young actor with star potential. Older actor take parts s
only when they're opposite women half their age so they can seem
virile and youthful. Older actresses mutilate themselves with plastic
surgery and still have trouble finding work. The media do their part
too: When's the last time you saw a magazine do a "Hot 50 Over 50"
issue? Premiere magazine recently spotlighted 25 under-35 Hollywood
hotties, while the cover of Vanity Fair's 2001 Hollywood issue
featured 10 "legendary" actresses, including the likes of Kate
Winslet and Penelope Cruz, who, with all due respect, are a lo-o-o-ng
way from legend status.</LD>
<TE>   So imagine my surprise when I opened Variety last week and
discovered, buried in a story about the lackluster late-summer box
office grosses, that during the last 10 years, only one moviegoing
age group had not shrunk or stagnated: moviegoers older than 50.
According to a survey by the Motion Picture Assn. of America, between
1990 and 2000, moviegoers in the obsessively sought-after 16-20 age
group had dropped from 20% to 17% of total viewers. Moviegoers in the
25-29 category dropped from 14% to 12%. Even 12- to 15-year-olds, who
are supposed to be part of the biggest demographic bulge since baby
boomers, dipped from 11% to 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, moviegoers ages 50-59 didn't just stay steady, they
shot up from 5% to 10% of total audience. A second survey I found on
the MPAA Web site, which interviewed frequent moviegoers, found that
during the last four years, attendance of over-40 moviegoers was up
as well.</TE>
<TE>   For demographic researchers, these numbers are no surprise. Thanks
to the graying of the baby boom generation, 38% of American adults
are 50 or older, a number that will grow to 47% by 2020. More
important, these older moviegoers behave very differently from their
parents when it comes to entertainment. The baby boom generation
remains loyal to its generation of film and rock stars--after all,
who do you think goes to all those Eagles reunion concerts?</TE>
<TE>   It's no coincidence that the over-50 moviegoer numbers have
suddenly started climbing as the boomer generation--whose oldest
members are now 56--begins to make its presence felt. These boomers
continue to be active moviegoers and culture consumers. One reason
"Late Night With David Letterman" is such a hot ad buy is that his
viewers (average age: 46.2) are a heavy moviegoing audience. Boomers
are a generation of Peter Pans. They don't berate their kids for
listening to Eminem--they play his CD in their SUVs. Obsessive about
exercising, always willing to spring for a nip 'n' tuck, their mantra
is: Forever young.</TE>
<TE>   As CBS research chief David Poltrack put it recently: "Marketers
will tell you that the biggest market of opportunity is to help
boomers fight the concept that they're old. They're going to fight
aging all the way."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood has been slow to seize the initiative. Movie marketers
still tend to stereotype "older" moviegoers as white-haired retirees
in golf shirts and plaid pants. But the leading edge of today's older
consumers, who came of age in the 1960s, are affluent and often eager
to sample new cultural trends. They've certainly been an
underappreciated force in the current movie season. The industry's
most astounding success story, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," is proving
unstoppable ($124 million at the box office and still going strong),
due in large part to the support of over-50 moviegoers. M. Night
Shyamalan's "Signs" has now out-grossed even "Austin Powers in
Goldmember," thanks to a strong turnout by older filmgoers. Older
moviegoers have also made up a healthy chunk of the audience for
"Road to Perdition," another solid summer hit.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers are definitely there," says MGM marketing chief Peter
Adee, who was at Universal last year when the studio's Oscar winner,
"A Beautiful Mind," rolled up huge box office numbers with the
support of older moviegoers. "The more you think about it, it does
seem like kind of a travesty. Why aren't we making more movies geared
to an older audience?"</TE>
<TE>   In fact, there were lots of awkward silences when I phoned studio
executives last week to ask: Why do you show the least amount of
interest in the segment of your audience that is apparently growing
the fastest? It all comes down to Hollywood's relentless courtship of
youth. The industry has become an opening-weekend business, and the
audience that attends on opening weekend is the horde of teenagers
primed for every new superhero action thriller and Adam Sandler
comedy.</TE>
<TE>   Of equal importance, kids are easier to hypnotize with a 30-second
TV spot. Older audiences are more likely to wait and see if a movie
gets good reviews or word-of-mouth. And because they have more things
going on in their lives, they may wait until the fourth weekend to
see a film, forcing studios to spend extra money to sustain their
marketing campaign until the oldsters finally show up.</TE>
<TE>   It's a terrible curse. Older moviegoers are--gasp!--discerning.
They actually can't be tricked into seeing a clunker by an
eye-catching trailer or TV spot. So most studios shy away from making
films that have to be well-executed instead of easily marketed.</TE>
<TE>   "When you make movies for older audiences, you have to make them
better," Columbia Pictures Chairman Amy Pascal says. "It's sad but
true, but it's easier to make brand-name movies than good ones. When
movies are good, like 'American Beauty' or 'Insomnia,' older
audiences will go see them. But they want to see good reviews before
they go."</TE>
<TE>   The economics of Hollywood make it a far bigger financial risk to
woo older moviegoers. Older-skewing movies are more costly than teen
comedies because they are customarily made by successful older stars
and directors, whose salaries and work habits ensure that the film
will carry a steep price tag. Stars like Robert Redford and Michael
Douglas don't come cheap, nor do directors like Sydney Pollack or Rob
Reiner. "Signs" may be a success, but studio executives remember the
pricey films aimed at older audiences that were expensive failures,
including "The Horse Whisperer," "Sabrina," "Random Hearts" and "The
Legend of Bagger Vance."</TE>
<TE>   "The math is so hard to support that it doesn't leave a lot of
room for error," says Revolution Studios chief Joe Roth. "You need a
good story to tell, you need good reviews and, because you need known
actors and a known director, it means you're going to be making a
big-budget movie. So if it doesn't work, it can be an expensive
failure. And the risk-averse people who run Hollywood are in the
business of avoiding expensive failures."</TE>
<TE>   There's also a more hidden cultural component. Many studio
production executives are in their 20s and 30s, making it unlikely
that they would respond to stories geared to an older audience--i.e.,
their parents. They are rewarded for discovering cool new stars and
filmmakers, not for finding material that might be right for Paul
Newman or Clint Eastwood. If they're going to take a risk, they'd
rather gamble on something hip: In Hollywood, you brag that you're in
business with Spike Jonze or Wes Anderson, not Penny Marshall.</TE>
<TE>   The media are just as guilty of ageism as the movie
studios--everyone wants to discover the new It Girl. Kirsten Dunst
and Reese Witherspoon grace magazine covers everywhere, but try to
remember the last time you saw a cover featuring perennial Oscar
contender Susan Sarandon, who's in three movies this month. Still,
older audiences have their supporters, like Screen Gems marketing
chief Valerie Van Galder, who had great success reaching older
moviegoers when she worked on the Fox Searchlight hit "Waking Ned
Devine."</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody in Hollywood believes it," she says. "But older moviegoers
are the one audience that will really support you."</TE>
<TE>   The sad truth is that older audiences crave movies with substance,
exactly the sort of movie Hollywood has few incentives to make today.
When it comes to the over-50 crowd, the industry's motto seems to be:
Let them watch HBO.</TE>
<TE>   "The people in our business should remember we're all going to be
older someday," DreamWorks marketing chief Terry Press says. "And
then we'll be the ones complaining, 'Why isn't anyone making any
movies for us?' "</TE>

<HD>Portrait of a Meadow</HD>
<DH>Anne Ophelia Dowden draws upon 'the most beautiful,
intricate network'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY GREEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ask botanists why they draw plants instead of photographing them and
they'll tell you that you can't understand how a plant works until
you draw it. Form follows function.</LD>
<LD>   Ask science publishers why they so often prefer illustrations to
photographs and they'll say the artist can subtly emphasize traits
that are critical to identifying a plant.</LD>
<LD>   Ask 95-year-old painter Anne Ophelia Dowden why she dedicated her
career to botanical illustration and she'll reply that it was to show
people how nature works. "The world is the most beautiful, intricate
network," she explains in a phone interview from her home in
Colorado. "My job was to portray part of that network."</LD>
<TE>   Between 1950 and 1990, Dowden wrote, designed and illustrated 11
books and was brought in to illustrate nine more. Each was dedicated
to drawing our eyes to everyday wonders: wild greens in the city,
poisonous plants in our paths and, her favorite, the timeless rituals
of pollination. In all, a meadow's worth of flowers fell from her
brush--not in some country studio but in a two-room apartment in New
York City.</TE>
<TE>   Dowden's work is now the subject of an exhibition at the Hunt
Institute for Botanical Documentation at Carnegie Mellon University
in Pittsburgh. But don't go to it, or seek out the catalog or her
books, expecting the work of an Audubon or Mark Catesby. This
naturalist's work is part chintz curtain, part educational
illustration and part Gray's Anatomy.</TE>
<TE>   She was born Anne Ophelia Todd in Denver in 1907 and raised in
Boulder. Her childhood passion was roaming the Front Range. English
neighbors, biologists who taught at the local high school and
university, became her earliest tutors.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time my sister or I would find a bug or a flower, we'd run
down and pound on their door to find out what it was," Dowden
recalls. She began painting these bugs and flowers.</TE>
<TE>   By 16, she was producing medical drawings for her father, a
pathologist at the University of Colorado. By 20 she was studying art
at Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh (now Carnegie
Mellon University) and by 23 she had assumed the first of two jobs
teaching art, at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. Her second teaching
job was at Manhattanville College, then in uptown Manhattan, now in
Purchase, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after her move to New York, a fellow Carnegie art student,
Raymond Dowden, followed and the two married. He joined the staff of
Cooper Union School of Art and Architecture in 1936, eventually
becoming head of the art department.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very good painter himself. I used to scold him for
devoting so much of his time to his students," she says. But she,
too, enjoyed teaching: "Pedagogy suited me," she recalls. Meanwhile,
she was intent on remaining a working artist. She took courses at the
Art Students League and joined a group that in 1933 did a mural for
the Chicago World's Fair. An amused Dowden recalls that they
"somewhat grandiloquently" called themselves "the American Design
Group" and, "with no experience, started designing wallpapers and
drapery fabrics."</TE>
<TE>   "I did an awful lot of chintzes and things like that," she says.
"For that, the research material was all floral. Botany had always
been my hobby. I began drawing more and more flowers." In 1952, this
led to a job for Life magazine illustrating edible wild plants,
milkweed sprouts and the like. Soon Natural History and Audubon
magazines were also publishing her drawings.</TE>
<TE>   She gave up teaching, turned full time botanical drawing and
sought out scientists to ensure that her work was accurate down to
every last stamen and pistil. On one project, drawing Western flowers
like flax and columbine in New York, using only dried specimens and
photographs, had her in agony.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope I didn't pull any botanical boners," she confessed in a
letter to a scientist advising her on the project. In New York, she
sought out Peter Nelson, then a botanist at Brooklyn College, for
advice. He remembers her as shy but determined and absolutely
unflappable. "She wasn't in the least bothered if I said, 'It doesn't
go that way; it goes this,' " he says.</TE>
<TE>   Her exactitude involved what Dowden jokingly dubbed "the world's
slowest working method." During summer holidays, she would make
exhaustive field sketches of flowers. Back in New York, where she and
her husband lived on the edge of Greenwich Village, she would depend
on specimens sent to her in the mail or donated by botanic gardens.
"What I liked best was to get the specimens, bring them home in bags,
put them in the bathtub and paint them like mad before they all
died," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Where did she and her husband bathe? "We took sponge baths."</TE>
<TE>   "I get the impression that her husband was very patient," says
Nelson.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine illustrations led to a long association with Thomas
Crowell publishers (later HarperCollins), where she was promptly
shown to the children's department. "They were the only ones that did
illustrated books," explains Dowden.</TE>
<TE>   She tackled book production with her by now trademark intensity,
devoting as much as five years research into children's books. These
include "The Secret Life of Flowers" (1964), "Wild Green Things in
the City: A Book of Weeds" (1972), "The Blossom on the Bough: A Book
of Trees" (1975) and "The Clover &amp; the Bee: A Book of Pollination"
(1990). Nelson read the proofs and scanned the drawings of at least
three of them. "She put every single line of her books in place," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   In the lead-up to one of her last books, "The Clover &amp; the Bee,"
she delightedly reported to her publisher, "I'm doing a lot of
prowling ... spying on insects and capturing specimens."</TE>
<TE>   It addressed her favorite subject: pollination. She begins the
book: "No subject in the realm of nature is closer to the heart of
life. None has more majestic implications--and none is more simply
entertaining and downright amusing."</TE>
<TE>   Researching that book, matching honeybees, solitary bees,
bumblebees, wasps, butterflies, moths, flies, beetles, birds and bats
to saucer flowers, bells, tubes and trap flowers, required the
patience of a statue. Nelson recalls her spending six weeks drawing
only leg hairs of a bee.</TE>
<TE>   She went to entomologist Louis Sorkin at the American Museum of
Natural History in New York to make sure she had done the bugs
justice. "I had other artists think they knew what they were doing
and then I'd show them the animal," he says. "She was able to see
what the real one looked like, then realize how that would associate
with drawings or photographs."</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, Dowden's husband died. By 1990, after 60 years in New
York, the Coloradan pined for the Rockies ("real mountains," she
says) and she returned to Boulder. In 1994, she finished her last
book, on poisonous plants, after which not even her magnifying
glasses could compensate for weakening eyesight.</TE>
<TE>   She gave away all her brushes to art students at Denver Botanic
Gardens. "There are always people who can use them, and they're
expensive!" she says.</TE>
<TE>   Her paintings took so long to do, Dowden seldom parted with them,
except to nearest and dearest. Nelson has one and calls it his most
prized possession. However, four years ago, Dowden donated her life's
work to the Hunt Institute, part of her alma mater, Carnegie Mellon.
The current exhibition marks her 95th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Dowden says that, had she stuck with pure painting, she would have
been an abstract artist. She likes the emphasis placed on design in
abstract art. But then she became preoccupied by flowers, weeds, the
meandering of a bee. Though she doesn't care for the word, she was an
early environmentalist, of a sort.</TE>
<TE>   "All we hear are environmentalists and their fights," she says.
"Many people think it's a business of saving long-eared owls. What's
important is that the owls are part of an intricate system that has
taken millions of years to evolve."</TE>
<TE>   Explaining this system in children's books never paid well. She
would have made more in upholstery, she sighs: "The joy, that's the
reward."</TE>

<HD>The Boisterous Breuker Kollektief Returns for Some Antic
Fun</HD>
<DH>The entertaining Dutch ensemble, back in L.A. after a
decade, draws upon a wide range of styles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Willem Breuker Kollektief--the Netherlands' most prominent and
often controversial jazz ensemble--was formed 28 years ago.
Saxophonist Breuker, a creatively mischievous character, organized an
ensemble that managed to embrace many of the iconoclastic notions of
'60s and '70s jazz without falling prey to their frequent tendency to
overlook the importance of the performer-audience connection.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday night at Rocco's, the Kollektief made its first Los
Angeles appearance in more than a decade, performing a late set
before an overflow crowd, entertainingly demonstrating a capacity to
blend an extraordinary array of differing musical elements. Almost
everything seemed grist for the mill: jaunty circus sounds,
straight-ahead jazz improvising, wild-eyed free jazz playing, brassy
fanfares, warmly harmonized textures, pre-Swing-era jazz styles and
much more.</LD>
<TE>   The Kollektief is also well known for the use of theatrical
elements reminiscent of '60s "happenings" (the predecessors of
today's performance art). Somewhat limited in that area by Rocco's
relatively small stage, the ensemble nonetheless tossed in a few
whimsical moments--one, for example, when Breuker pushed aside
trumpeter Boy Raamaker (one of the group's original members) in an
effort to gain control of the microphone. After he did so,
Breuker--playing soprano saxophone--embarked on a solo encompassing
everything from fleet, high-speed note runs to animal cries
reminiscent of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band's "Livery Stable
Blues."</TE>
<TE>   Other solos, especially from Raamaker and trombonists Andy Bruce
and Bernard Hunnekink, added a boisterous energy to the musical mix,
alternately recalling New Orleans jazz and the vocalized expressions
characteristic of early Duke Ellington "jungle" numbers. Ensemble
sounds ranged from random, unstructured blowing to crisp,
well-orchestrated swinging, often in unusual meters.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the material was original (much of it tracing to the
Kollektief's new album, "Misery"), with the exception of an extremely
idiosyncratic rendering of the standard "I Remember April."</TE>
<TE>   And, although this colorful, musically omnivorous approach might
seem to be a recipe for collective chaos, the results were far more
compelling--a musical experience fully satisfying the jazz world's
quest for spontaneity and surprise, while also including a warm
acknowledgment of the many musical currents, from Europe, Africa and
elsewhere, that have been the wellsprings of 20th and 21st century
music.</TE>

<HD>Such Dedication, Such Good Looks</HD>
<DH>'Presidio Med' specializes in pretty faces and corny plots.
Much better is 'Haunted.' 'In-Laws' and 'Hidden Hills' wear thin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One day there will be a TV series about doctors who are not only
unfit and uncaring, but also homely. You know, like some of the ones
you've had.</LD>
<LD>   But don't hold your breath this season for Quasimodos in lab
coats.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, get ready for more of prime time's doctors who are great,
and great-looking too. No dogs here, no derelicts. These kids make
the extra incision, take the extra stitch and, in the case of
oncologist Rae Brennan (Dana Delany), have the extra orgasm.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Rae's bedside manner is, well, distinctive. "Get your sweet
Greek ass over here," she calls to her handsome lover in rural
Pakistan, where they annually donate a couple of dusty weeks to help
the locals. Then she's out of there and back in San Francisco with
her husband.</TE>
<TE>   CBS titles this mostly matriarchic pantheon of warmth, goodness
and smoldering sexuality "Presidio Med." Delivered by the impresarios
behind the vastly better "ER," it arrives tonight with a pair of NBC
comedies--the so-so "In-Laws" and dreadful "Hidden Hills"--and UPN's
moderately chilling "Haunted."</TE>
<TE>   You could make the case that "Presidio Med" is funnier than either
"In-Laws" or "Hidden Hills," and scarier than "Haunted" as it mingles
ultrasounds with ultragoo.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone familiar with TV doctors, from Kildare and Casey to present
company, will know this drill. What you get here is the usual litany
of maladies and patients who have them. They range tonight from a
driven football coach who resists life-saving surgery that will
interrupt his championship season to an old man whose terminal
illness brings him closer to his estranged son.</TE>
<TE>   In this misty environment, even death becomes an inspiring triumph
over adversity, as these frayed hospital scenarios assume cornball
lives of their own that transcend the show's generally good acting.</TE>
<TE>   Jules Keating (Julianne Nicholson) is the devoted pediatrician
with worries of her own. Jackie Colette (Sasha Alexander) is the
kick-butt plastic surgeon who bullies a heartless HMO to its knees.
Harriet Lanning (Blythe Danner) is the excruciatingly wise and
dedicated ob-gyn who CBS says "still loves getting up in the middle
of the night to deliver babies." Letty Jordon (Anna Deavere Smith) is
the in-your-face cardiologist assigned by this show's producers to be
the Presidio Medical Group's token Average Looking Person. Internist
Matt Slingerland (Paul Blackthorne) is the hunky Brit.</TE>
<TE>   Rae throws so much warmth toward her patients that you expect them
to flame up like torches. And speaking of heat, count on her crossing
paths again with the "sweet Greek ass," otherwise known as surgeon
Nicholas Kokoris (Oded Fehr).</TE>
<TE>   As bad as this series is, it's Johns Hopkins compared with ABC's
bummer new "Meds," which arrives Wednesday opposite the time slot in
which "Presidio Med" next airs. But that's another story.</TE>
<TE>   As are "In-Laws" and "Hidden Hills."</TE>
<TE>   The former, from the producers of "Frasier," is surely no
Frasier," although mildly funny at times while seeking laughs from
newlyweds Matt (Elon Gold) and Alex (Bonnie Somerville) moving in
with her well-to-do parents, Marlene (Jean Smart) and Victor (Dennis
Farina), a coarse bully who loves picking on his new son-in-law</TE>
<TE>   Victor is so tyrannical that he orders for everyone when taking
the family to dinner. "All you've got to do," he tells intimidated
Matt, "is chew and swallow."</TE>
<TE>   The show is Victor's, and Farina is right for the role. But soon
you're choking on this overbearing character and his relentless
harping. That's especially the case in Episode 2 when Victor allows
Matt to drive him to the eye doctor in his treasured Cadillac
Fleetwood. Ohhhhhh nooooooo.</TE>
<TE>   Forget the Fleetwood, put a brake on Victor.</TE>
<TE>   HBO gives us "Sex and the City"; NBC, Sex and the Suburb, the
difference being about 50 IQ points. And oh, yes, NBC's new comedy
gabs and giggles about sex, but doesn't show it.</TE>
<TE>   As the least bearable series of the fall, "Hidden Hills" deserves
hiding. Its setting is a posh gated community on the outskirts of
metropolitan L.A. inhabited entirely by myopic idiots who think only
about sex. In the epicenter of this libidinous earthquake of
young-marrieds-with-kids are Doug (Justin Louis) and Janine (Paula
Marshall), and Zack (Dondre T. Whitfield) and Sarah (Tamara Taylor).</TE>
<TE>   Doug's runaway sexual fantasies share the premiere along with
juvenile ramblings from Zack and their woo-woo, hubba-hubba,
girl-watching, carnally obsessed chums. For diversion, we get their
wives talking about sex.</TE>
<TE>   How much fun is "Hidden Hills," which is closest in tone to HBO's
almost-as-inane "Mind of a Married Man"?</TE>
<TE>   The high jinks begin when Doug, who coaches a kids' softball team,
learns that his assistant is "Porn Mom" (Kristin Bauer), a sexy
turn-on who operates a pornography Web site he and his friends (note
the rainbow demographics) watch behind their wives' backs.</TE>
<TE>   And how's this for a torrid finish? A baseball hits Doug below the
belt. Which is where this lowly series spends most of its time.</TE>
<TE>   A much better choice in this time period is UPN's new "Haunted."</TE>
<TE>   Some of us would go just about anywhere for a good scare. Stephen
King has been pretty much a bust on TV, but "Haunted" delivers a
decent fright while clouding its refreshingly unglamorous hero in
inky ambiguity.</TE>
<TE>   The tone for our encounter with private eye Frank Taylor (Matthew
Fox) is somber, dark and foreboding as he confronts inexplicable
phenomena and forges links to the hereafter while working on a case
involving a kidnapped boy.</TE>
<TE>   Haunting Frank are memories of his own missing young son--whose
abduction several years ago cost him his police career and
marriage--and other souls from beyond the grave, including that of a
terrifying killer (John Mann).</TE>
<TE>   You get no sense of where this is going, until it gets there,
somewhat slowly. And very much a stock character is Frank's former
police partner (Russell Hornsby), who gives him privileged
information reluctantly, against his better judgment. "That man's
gonna cost me my pension." he grouses. But Frank's fleeting
encounters with his son "on the other side" are as mysterious as they
are heartbreaking, and there is enough suspense here to keep you on
edge.</TE>
<TE>   If the scares endure, perhaps so will "Haunted."</TE>
<TE>   "Presidio Med" will be shown at 10 tonight on CBS, then move to
its regular 10 p.m. time slot Wednesday. The network has rated it
TV-PGLSV (may be unsuitable for young children, with advisories for
coarse language, sex and violence).</TE>
<TE>   "In-Laws" will be shown at 8 p.m. Tuesdays on NBC. The network has
rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable for young children).</TE>
<TE>   "Hidden Hills" will be shown at 9:30 p.m. Tuesdays on NBC. The
network has rated it TV-14 (may be unsuitable for children under the
age of 14).</TE>
<TE>   "Haunted" will be shown at 9 p.m. Tuesdays on UPN. The network has
rated it TV-PGV (may be unsuitable for young children, with
advisories for violence).</TE>

<LD>The Brits are on tippy-toe over the coming mid-October "celebration"
to which about 100 friends of the Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker
Bowles have been invited at Buckingham Palace.</LD>
<LD>   It is believed that this could be the occasion when Charles
announces his intention to marry the woman who has been his
companion, off and on, for 30 years.</LD>
<LD>   Charles and Camilla have heretofore avoided entertaining at
Buckingham Palace. They have always used St. James' Palace or
Highgrove. But now, this is the end of a year that has seen the queen
mother's death, Queen Elizabeth II's own Golden Jubilee, the fifth
anniversary of the death of Diana, the Princess of Wales, and Prince
Harry turning 18.</LD>
<TE>   Furthermore, the queen and Prince Philip will be on an October
tour of Canada and will miss this "celebration," which they may not
feel too celebratory about in any case. Camilla has already bought a
new gown from the design couple Robinson Valentine, and dinner and
dancing in the palace ballroom will include her favorite flowers,
lilies.</TE>

<HD>Emmy Ratings Are Good, Not Great</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 54th annual Emmy Awards yielded solid but unspectacular ratings,
improving markedly from last year's twice-delayed, World
Series-battered ceremony while falling short of the tune-in achieved
in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Preliminary estimates indicate that 19.8 million people were
watching NBC's telecast of the show at any given moment--a 16%
increase over a year ago, when the Emmys were postponed until
November and had to compete with the seventh game of the series.</LD>
<LD>   The audience was down, however, from two years ago, when the
awards drew 21.8 million viewers. Overall, Sunday's broadcast
represented the second most-watched Emmys of the past six years, just
ahead of the last time NBC carried them in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   The Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences, which organizes the
awards, was hoping for strong ratings to help bolster its case for a
more lucrative television rights fee. A four-year agreement in which
the Emmys rotated among the major networks concluded with this year's
ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   By way of comparison, Sunday's audience was smaller than that NBC
generated in January with the Golden Globe Awards and slightly higher
than viewing of the Grammy Awards in February.</TE>
<TE>   NBC estimates that more than 40 million people watched at least a
portion of the broadcast, which ran for more than three hours.</TE>
<TE>   This year's Emmys did have to compete with HBO's "The Sopranos,"
which drew a record audience for the pay cable channel with its
fourth-season premiere last week. Audience totals for that program
were not available, with final rating averages for both to be issued
today and published Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The network also telecast an hourlong Emmy pre-show, "Countdown to
the Emmys," which averaged a mere 6.9 million viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Locally, the awards were watched by 18% of homes in KNBC's viewing
area, or roughly 960,000 of the region's 5.3 million households.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, the Emmys performed disproportionately well in big
cities, including Los Angeles.</TE>

<LD>   Gibson's New Project: Christ ... in Aramaic</LD>
<LD>   For the first time since he took the reins of the Oscar-winning
"Braveheart" (1995), Mel Gibson is returning to the director's chair.</LD>
<TE>   His new focus: "The Passion," a chronicle of the final 12 hours of
the life of Jesus Christ, starring James Caviezel. Gibson will
confine himself to off-camera duties in the movie, which will deal
with Christ's humanity as well as his divine aspects, and feature a
primarily Italian cast.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the challenge: The minimal dialogue will be spoken in
Latin and Aramaic, the language spoken in Palestine at that time. And
no subtitles are planned.</TE>
<TE>   Producers Gibson, Bruce Davey and Steve McEveety have yet to line
up a distributor--not even Fox, the studio where their Icon
Productions is based.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, nobody wants to touch something filmed in two dead
languages," Gibson said at a news conference Friday in Rome, where
the movie is in pre-production for a planned Nov. 4 shoot. "They
think I'm crazy and maybe I am. But maybe I'm a genius.... Hopefully,
I'll be able to transcend language barriers with visual storytelling.
If I fail, I'll put subtitles on it, though I don't want to."</TE>

<TE>   American Lung Assn. Targets Smoking Shows</TE>
<TE>   Fox's "Futurama" and "The Bernie Mac Show" have wheezed their way
to Phlemmy Awards, the annual dishonors bestowed by the American Lung
Assn. for TV shows that portray smokers.</TE>
<TE>   "Bernie Mac" was cited because its main character is partial to
cigars, while the animated "Futurama" "gave lead roles to Marlboro
and Camel cigarettes," according to the Sacramento chapter of the
organization.</TE>
<TE>   "Friends" and "24" won Pink Lung honors because their characters
don't smoke, even though some "Friends" actors do in real life, the
group said.</TE>

<TE>   Nolte Seeks Treatment for Substance Abuse</TE>
<TE>   Nick Nolte, arrested earlier this month for suspicion of driving
under the influence, has checked into a Connecticut substance abuse
and psychiatric center where celebrities such as Billy Joel and Diana
Ross have recently sought treatment. He entered the facility on Sept.
14, three days after the arrest in Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   "Nick Nolte voluntarily entered Silver Hill Hospital to receive
advice and counsel that he feels he needs at this time," his
publicist, Paul Bloch, said Monday. "He will be there as long as he
feels is necessary."</TE>

<TE>   Irvine Theater to House Trevor's Oscar, Emmy</TE>
<TE>   The Oscar statuette that Claire Trevor won for her 1948 supporting
role in "Key Largo" as gangster Edward G. Robinson's alcoholic moll
will take up permanent residence in the open-air lobby of the newly
renovated theater at UC Irvine that is named for the actress, who
died two years ago at age 90.</TE>
<TE>   Trevor's 1956 Emmy, for a live TV performance in "Dodsworth," also
will be encased outside the Claire Trevor Theatre at its reopening
gala on Nov. 16.</TE>
<TE>   UCI's school of the arts is named for Trevor, whose stepson,
Donald Bren, is the mega-developer chairman of the Irvine Co. The
actress contributed $500,000 in 1999 to renovate the 1970-vintage
theater, improving its sight lines and providing new, high-tech
staging accouterments.</TE>

<TE>   Ex-Lennon Assistant on Trial in New York</TE>
<TE>   John Lennon's former personal assistant exploited the ex-Beatle
and his wife, Yoko Ono, by stealing priceless family photos and
mementos, then selling them to collectors, a lawyer charged in court
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   A lawsuit against the assistant, Frederic Seaman, "is about how
John and Yoko put their trust in Mr. Seaman's hands, and how he
betrayed that trust," Ono's attorney, Paul LiCalsi, said in opening

<TE>   Ono, 69, sued Seaman in 1999, demanding that he surrender the
rights to 374 photos he took of Lennon, and turn over about $75,000
in profits from the sale of the rock legend's manuscripts and
letters.</TE>
<TE>   LiCalsi told jurors that Ono dismissed Seaman in 1981, unaware
that he had been looting Lennon's files. In 1983, Seaman pleaded
guilty to second-degree larceny for stealing Lennon's diaries; he was
sentenced to five years' probation and ordered to return all the
property.</TE>

<HD>Harmony Reigns at Rangoli Festival of Indian Music and
Dance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Images of community and harmony dominated the second Rangoli Festival
of Indian Music and Dance program Sunday at the Cal State Northridge
Performing Arts Center, part of the ongoing World Festival of Sacred
Music.</LD>
<LD>   The first half consisted of the premiere of Malathi Iyengar's
50-minute dance suite, "Sacred Geometry." The second was a potpourri
of pieces by various choreographers representing a mix of world dance
traditions.</LD>
<LD>   "Sacred Geometry" started intriguingly with two couples embodying
divergent relationships and states of energy.</LD>
<TE>   One couple was symmetrical, parallel and balanced (K. Murali Mohan
and Shyamala Moorty). The other was increasingly tense,
dramatic--human in need and sympathy (Ronald Burton and Sandra
Chatterjee).</TE>
<TE>   How and why the two sets of dancers combined, much less evolved
through solos, trios and groupings was not altogether clear, despite
notes in the program citing philosophical and spiritual concepts
regarding geometric shapes and the creation of diversity out of
unity.</TE>
<TE>   What was clear, however, was some arresting dancing by these
dancers and others, including C. Renjith Babu and Neewin Hershall.</TE>
<TE>   The most impressive was a section called "Navagraha," in which a
serene Hershall represented the sun attracting nine orbiting planets
in a series of distinctive solos. As above, so below: the Epilogue
revealed the same human harmony in a village laborers' circle dance.</TE>
<TE>   Part 2 of the program also ended in a harmonious communal dance,
"Djembe," by Nzingha Camara's dynamic Ballet Kouman Kele West African
Dance and Drum Ensemble. Everyone here both belonged to a group but
also emerged to dance a very individualized solo.</TE>
<TE>   The second half also included too brief solos by American tapper,
clogger and Irish and French-Canadian step-dancer Gary Larsen; a
kathak solo by Mohan; an Indian village work dance, and an
interpretive medieval tapestry and sculpture solo by Linda Gold.</TE>

<HD>A Tale of Politics and Passion</HD>
<DH>Jose Rivera's 'Adoration of the Old Woman' twines Puerto
Rico's statehood debate with a romantic folk tale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LA JOLLA--Two stories are vying for control of Jose Rivera's new
play, "Adoration of the Old Woman."</LD>
<LD>   The story that takes up most of the time at La Jolla Playhouse
examines the quandary facing Puerto Rico: Should it become the 51st
state, should it become an independent nation or should it retain its
commonwealth status?</LD>
<LD>   This topic is seldom seen on stage, at least on the mainland. So
it feels fresh, though Rivera sometimes uses it as a mere pretext for
a situation out of a romance novel.</LD>
<TE>   Yet the title of the play refers to the second story, which is
about a very old woman (Ivonne Coll) whose bed is haunted by the
ghost of her dead husband's lover, a young woman named Adoracion
(Marisol Padilla Sanchez). This side of the play is taken directly
from Rivera's experiences with his great aunt, whom he visited in Las
Arenas, Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   The tale of the old woman and Adoracion probably means more to
Rivera, but it doesn't feel as fresh or as urgent as the play's
political content. The major revelation that emerges from the ghost
story is a development that we can see coming far in advance.</TE>
<TE>   Rivera hasn't found a meaningful way to unite his two stories.
After the play was over, I wondered if the old woman, or Adoracion
perhaps, is a metaphor for Puerto Rico, or for the United States
or.... I gave up. Rivera may have a metaphor worked out in his head,
but it hasn't translated to the stage.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the titular narrative feels like a folk tale included
primarily as a nod to magical realism, one of Rivera's favorite
genres. One of the lines in the play acknowledges this, joking about
the old woman's story as an example of magical realism. But the ghost
story also feels like a distraction from the more compelling material
about the political situation.</TE>
<TE>   The political dispute is painted in broad strokes as a tussle
between two men who are both attracted to the old woman's 17-year-old
great-granddaughter Vanessa (Tamara Mello). This cynical girl has
been sent to Puerto Rico from her home in Paterson, N.J., in the hope
that some brushing up against her family's roots will straighten her
out.</TE>
<TE>   At first, she's courted by Ismael (Gary Perez), a real estate
broker who is a fervent believer in statehood. Next she's attracted
to Cheo (John Ortiz), a young, U.S.-educated advocate of
independence. The controversy gets an extra jolt from the fact that
the play is set in "the near future," before an election in which the
issue will be decided by the people of Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't take long to figure out where Rivera's sympathies lie.
The great-grandmother, the voice of old Puerto Rico, wants
independence. The pro-statehood Ismael is drawn as an older lech,
while Cheo's passions are so pure that he refuses to be diverted from
political campaigning for a month before he and Vanessa consummate
their mutual attraction on Election Day.</TE>
<TE>   In the last part of the play, the offstage melodrama gets
extremely hot and heavy. But the plot turns feel more like a writer's
machinations than like something that actually might happen.</TE>
<TE>   Mello, at the play's center, has a high voice that emphasizes her
youth. It seems a little unlikely that her great-grandmother, who is
very religious, would smile so benignly on her casual comings and
goings with two older men.</TE>
<TE>   But certainly a woman this old is beyond noticing such details?
Not necessarily. This woman notices a lot, and Coll (who is actually
in her 50s) has such a strong voice that her advanced age isn't
especially credible. She's that old mainly so that Rivera can say she
was born in 1898, when the Yankees invaded.</TE>
<TE>   In Jo Bonney's staging, Ortiz and Perez are very good as the men,
even when stuck with lame exchanges with Vanessa. After an initially
bold presence, Sanchez mostly fades into the woodwork.</TE>

<HD>'Nadesico' Brings Home Its Nutty Anime Warfare</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES SOLOMON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For sheer freewheeling insanity, only "Rocky and Bullwinkle" and "The
Simpsons" rival the 1996 anime series "Martian Successor Nadesico."
"Nadesico" was initially criticized in Japan for making fun of both
anime and the fan subculture. But its good-natured silliness won over
both critics and large audiences on both sides of the Pacific.</LD>
<LD>   Although it was not a landmark in Japanese animation, as "Neon
Genesis Evangelion" was, "Nadesico" holds a special place in the
hearts of otaku (devotees of anime). Fans of both sexes turn up at
anime conventions dressed as Ruri Hoshino, the sardonic science
officer with the light blue ponytails.</LD>
<LD>   The six-disc "Complete Chronicles" set (available today from A.D.
Vision, $90) presents the entire 26-episode series in all its
nuttiness.</LD>
<TE>   The year is 2195, and Earth is at war with the Jovian Lizards, who
have conquered the moon and Mars. Fed up with the ineffectual United
Earth Space Force, the directors of Nergal Heavy Industries build
their own super-battleship, the Nadesico.</TE>
<TE>   To staff the ship, Nergal hires "top people who may have slight
personality problems." In addition to Ruri (voiced by the
single-named Kira), the crew includes lecherous mechanic Seiya
Uribatake (John Swasey) and voice-actress-turned-communications
officer Megumi Reinard (Jenni Strader), the former star of "Natural
Princess Magical Lychee," a takeoff on "Sailor Moon."</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Gai Daigoji (Brett Weaver), a fanatic admirer of
"Gekiganger 3," a hilarious spoof of '60s and '70s giant robot shows
("Getter Robo," "Gigantor," et al.). Passion for the show spreads and
at one point, to bolster morale, the crew holds a "Geki fest" that
satirizes anime conventions, including participants in costume,
marathon screenings and booths selling special merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   The story reaches unparalleled heights of absurdity in Episode No.
14, "Let's Go With Hot-Blooded Anime," as the casts of "Nadesico" and
"Gekiganger 3" watch each other's programs, borrowing ideas for
weapons and grumbling about the plots. When "Gekiganger" pilot Akira
complains that the day's episode of "Nadesico" is just a clip show
that looks like an introductory program, half-pint Junpei replies,
"Don't you know, they always do this in the middle of animated
series, so new viewers will know what's happening!" Joe, another
pilot, disagrees: "I'll bet the studio was running behind schedule
and they needed a quick filler episode."</TE>
<TE>   When they're not watching "Gekiganger 3," the crew of this
spaceship of fools has to deal with some serious problems. The ship's
computer, for example, has a psychotic episode and begins attacking
enemy and allied ships with equal fervor. Then the crew unmasks the
disinformation campaign waged by Nergal and the Earth government: The
Jovian enemies aren't alien lizards but the descendants of exiled
human freedom fighters.</TE>
<TE>   As is often the case in anime, the ending of "Nadesico" leaves a
number of plot points unresolved. Ruri suggests that some of these
issues may be sorted out "in the inevitable sequel."</TE>
<TE>   Although the three studios involved didn't produce a sequel, they
made a feature ("Nadesico: Prince of Darkness," 1998) and a season of
"Gekiganger 3"; negotiations are reportedly underway to release both
in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Who knew interplanetary warfare could be so much fun?</TE>

<HD>Still True 'Blue' in Its 10th Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Summer is over but temperatures are still running high in the 15th
Precinct, home of "NYPD Blue."</LD>
<LD>   Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) is marked for death after roughing up
the girlfriend of a ruthless, drug-dealing pimp called Money T.
Sipowicz's partner, John Clark (Mark-Paul Gosselaar), becomes a
suspect in a hooker's murder when his name apparently is found in her
appointment book and he lies to internal affairs to cover for his
pop, John Clark Sr. (Joe Spano), who also is "on the job."</LD>
<LD>   As Sipowicz's unlikely relationship with the younger and prettier
Det. Connie McDowell (Charlotte Ross) steams up, Clark's evasiveness
creates a rift in his romance with the squad's Rita Ortiz (Jacqueline
Obradors).</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a sadistic, misfit slacker (an eerie Laurence Cohen)
takes out his rage on elderly women.</TE>
<TE>   If the show doesn't crackle with quite the same freshness that it
had in its heyday under co-creator and producer David Milch, it's
still more intense and entertaining than almost anything in prime
time. The series begins its 10th season tonight at 10 on ABC,
preceded by an hourlong special, "Inside NYPD Blue: A Decade on the
Job," with host Joe Mantegna.</TE>
<TE>   Those offended by the crude language and often-violent contempt
for civil rights that have become hallmarks of this series will find
no respite in tonight's episode, not-so-sensitively titled "Ho Down."
But fans will appreciate the caustic wit of writers Nicholas Wootton
and Bill Clark, and the gritty verve of director Mark Tinker, all
veterans of the show.</TE>
<TE>   As it was with the aging Clint Eastwood in this summer's "Blood
Work," it's reassuring to see the 15th squad back on the job.</TE>

<HD>At Home With Rod Stewart</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As cars approached the circular driveway in front of Rod Stewart's
baroque Italianate estate in Beverly Park on a recent evening, two
men in kilts saluted every arrival with a bleat of their bagpipes.</LD>
<LD>   Inside the mansion, the little rocker with the big hair showed off
his art collection--pre-Raphael knights and fair ladies on every
wall.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the first time that I've done this," Stewart said, referring
to the fund-raiser he was hosting. "I'm such a private person."</LD>
<TE>   Nearby, Chris Noth encouraged Kelsey Grammer to have a look at the
library--thousands of volumes (Oscar Wilde, Charles Dickens,
Plutarch's Lives)--and framed photos of Stewart as soccer dad on
every table.</TE>
<TE>   When Andre Agassi walked by, Grammer flung himself around his neck
before completing his tour of the house. "Wow, how about that," the
"Frasier" star kept saying. "That's something."</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Schwarzenegger seemed to share the sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a nice home," Schwarzenegger remarked as he arrived with
Maria Shriver. "Compared to this, we live like cotton pickers in the
field."</TE>
<TE>   Some guests, anticipating a scene, had brought cameras to document
their visit.</TE>
<TE>   One man on the balcony got a call on his cell phone. "Honey," the
man next to him joked, "we're at Rod's house. I don't know that we'll
call back."</TE>
<TE>   As the 150 guests sat down for a dinner prepared by Wolfgang Puck,
Camryn Manheim took the stage to introduce Schwarzenegger, who was
being honored by the evening's organizers. "I'm such a Democrat," she
joked, "I can't even say his name." The evening, she said, would
benefit the actor's charity of choice: "children with underdeveloped
biceps."</TE>
<TE>   In reality, the evening benefited a variety of children's
charities, including Schwarzenegger's Inner-City Games Foundation.
Schwarzenegger (a Republican candidate, or not, for governor in 2004)
got bipartisan best wishes.</TE>
<TE>   Hillary and Bill Clinton sent their love, as did Bush pere, who
also offered a special presidential approval of "Frasier." "Of
course, Kelsey, two Presidents Bush are Kelsey Grammer fans," the
Bush letter printed in the program said. (Grammer was another of the
evening's honorees.)</TE>
<TE>   During the event's auction, Agassi became a big bidder, buying a
Bruce Springsteen guitar for $9,000 and baseball memorabilia for
$12,000.</TE>
<TE>   One of the costliest items, three holes of golf with Bill Clinton,
went for $35,000.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Eric McCormack introduced Grammer. "I've been quite
impressed by the way Kelsey conducts his life," comedic beat,
"lately." Referring to the Emmys, McCormack noted: "Taking Kelsey out
of the best actor category is like taking God out of the Pledge of
Allegiance."</TE>
<TE>   McCormack then read the inscription on the small sculpture that
had been handed to Grammer. It was a music award originally presented
to Stewart in 1993, as someone had forgotten the real awards, and
pilfered the rocker's awards cabinet for a substitute.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pleasure to receive that," Grammer said.</TE>
<TE>   When Red Buttons was introduced, Shriver jumped to her feet,
giving him a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Buttons, with characteristic delivery, surveyed the grounds. "What
a dump," he said, before listing those unable to make the party.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike Ovitz, who's recovering from a vicious gay mafia drive-by
slapping, couldn't attend." Buttons then ripped into Steven
Spielberg, Oliver Stone, Madonna, Michael Jackson and Anna Nicole
Smith. A man in a gray suit held onto the edge of the bar as tears of
laughter ran down his cheeks.</TE>
<TE>   As the evening drew to a close, guests lined up for their cars
outside, with a couple of guests discussing how best to armor your
limo. There was the usual end-of-evening flurry of business cards.
One security guy pressed his card into Grammer's palm, offering his
services.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Schwarzenegger chatted about the event.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like such a beginner," he said, before being whisked away
in a Jeep with Shriver and Danny DeVito.</TE>

<TE>   Post-Emmy Parties</TE>
<TE>   Most celebrities left the television academy's Governors Ball
early after the 54th Emmy Awards, no doubt headed to West Hollywood
to party-hop. The palatial room was nearly empty of A-listers by 10
p.m. But Ray Romano stayed much later, gold statuette in hand,
savoring his best comedy actor win. He waded through throngs of
well-wishers who swarmed him, despite attempts by event staff to keep
them back. Afterward, Romano headed to the HBO party at Spago,
joining Conan O'Brien, Kim Cattrall and Alan Ball. Also at the HBO
party were more than 30 World War II veterans, celebrating the "Band
of Brothers" Emmy win with Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg. On Sunset
Boulevard, at the "Entertainment Tonight" party held at the Mondrian
hotel, Matthew Perry celebrated the "Friends" Emmy win, while David
Hyde Pierce went straight for the bar.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent a lot of time working out," he said, "what I want now is
a martini."</TE>
<TE>   Also at the party, sponsored by Glamour magazine, were Christian
Slater, Owen Wilson, Rachel Hunter, Dr. Phil, Penny Marshall and
Paula Abdul. Kelly Osbourne commandeered an NBC crew while brother
Jack tried to persuade women to jump into the pool. As Oprah arrived,
David Allen Grier cried out to her, "Marry me!"</TE>

<HD>Sharing Laughter ... Sharing Tiers</HD>
<DH>Awards* For those at the Emmys, seeing the stars in action
was a great experience--even from the nose-bleed section.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GINA PICCALO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Emmy night--it's just part of the job for the stars and includes
hours of pre-show preening, a basic limo ride, roughly three hours in
the spotlight, a whirlwind round of glamorous after-parties and, if
they're very lucky, a gold statuette.</LD>
<LD>   But for the average folks who scored tickets in the upper reaches
of the second balcony--far from the glitz of the main floor--it's
another matter entirely.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm a middle-school teacher on the trip of a lifetime," said
Lynette Gonzales of the San Francisco Bay Area, as she made her way
to balcony seats at Sunday night's ceremony at the Shrine Auditorium.
"I'm so impressed with everything. Just seeing all those limos lined
up ... a roomful of people who are so glamorous. It's just a
fantasy."</LD>
<TE>   Gonzales and her husband, Mike, a community college counselor,
bought tickets through a friend in the TV industry. She said she was
trying to memorize every moment of the evening to share with her
eighth-graders when she returned home: "It's just so grand that it's
just what I imagined it would be."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone can buy tickets to the awards, but they're not cheap.
Balcony seats, which are far enough away to require binoculars, are
as much as $300 each.</TE>
<TE>   But that wasn't enough to discourage Chip Morton, a Destin, Fla.,
investment banker. He bought tickets five days before the event to
help celebrate his wife's 30th birthday. During the show Morton met
Steve Brass, a computer-systems specialist from Dallas, who flew out
to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary. The two men were killing
time in the lobby between commercial breaks, trying to find invites
to some of the networks' after-parties. They stood amid a flock of
guests in rented tuxedos and sequined gowns, who ate $4 shrimp kebabs
and mini beef dumplings, while sipping wine and complaining about the
heat. (Temperatures in downtown Los Angeles soared into the 90s on
Sunday.)</TE>
<TE>   Downstairs near the ladies room, Nikol Reinkey, 18, gushed over
the show with her cousin, Kristi Marx. "It's so, like, surreal," said
Marx, 23, a student from Chicago. "I know," said Reinkey, adjusting a
full-length black dress--a gown she wore a few months ago to her
senior prom. Reinkey's job in NBC's mail room set the girls apart
from the nosebleed-seat crowd; they scored seats on the main floor.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego boat captain Mark Wilson bought his ticket for $200 on
the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Web site. A devoted TV fan,
Wilson came alone. He watched the show in relative silence, seemingly
awed by the whole affair. At one point, he noted of the event: "It's
out of my league.</TE>
<TE>   "My family wasn't particularly interested," he said. But no doubt
they, and other friends and relatives of the balcony crowd, heard all
about it. During the commercial breaks, people inside the auditorium
shouted on cell phones and snapped pictures while a video loop of
1970s TV shows ran on large screens. Favorites such as "The Love
Boat" and "Sanford and Son" warranted scattered applause.</TE>
<TE>   When they returned to their seats, enthusiasm was the order of the
day. Since the show is a made-for-TV event, its executive producer,
Gary Smith, had prepped the audience for the cameras before the
telecast began. "Applaud with verve," he instructed the crowd of
about 6,000, "and laugh even when you think it's not funny."</TE>
<TE>   The high-altitude set was more than happy to oblige.</TE>

<LD>AMERICAN BISON</LD>
<LD>   A Natural History</LD>
<LD>   By Dale F. Lott</LD>
<TE>   University of California Press</TE>
<TE>   220 pages, $29.95</TE>
<TE>   Many animals have two identities. There's the real creature that
lives on this planet, and there's the imaginary creature that lives
in our minds.</TE>
<TE>   So contends Dale F. Lott, behavioral ecologist and professor
emeritus at the UC Davis, in "American Bison," a natural history of
the majestic animals that were once hallmarks of the vast American
grasslands.</TE>
<TE>   "The real animal," he writes quite eloquently, "is a product of
natural selection; the mythical one is a product of our yearnings and
fears. The real one can teach us about nature; the mythical one can
teach us about human nature."</TE>
<TE>   In this rich and enthusiastic narrative, Lott uses exuberant humor
and great passion for his subject to elicit reader interest,
illuminating the biological and mythical bison--popularly known as
the buffalo--and what they tell us about nature, human and otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Storytelling--not lecturing--is a practice he has honed over 35
years of teaching, and it is the scenes he sketches that bring his
story to life.</TE>
<TE>   Readers enter intense episodes of bison interaction and fierce
mating behavior, witness displays of the animal's imposing physical
deftness and observe complex social communication, with Lott
interpreting for us each nuance.</TE>
<TE>   Lott's fascination with bison did not begin from a vague point of
scientific curiosity or with the altruistic desire to save the
vanishing species.</TE>
<TE>   Born on the National Bison Range in Western Montana, Lott was the
grandson of the range superintendent, his father a range employee;
bison are a lens through which he views the world.</TE>
<TE>   "I first encountered bison not as symbols of the West, the
squandering of a natural resource, or a conservation triumph," he
writes. "They were simply the animals I had seen most often when I
was a young child--enthralling in and of themselves."</TE>
<TE>   In sketching a portrait of the bison's precarious place in America
today, Lott bemoans the compromised state of the prairies, a once
rich and vibrant ecosystem that no longer exists in its grandeur.</TE>
<TE>   But Lott acquaints readers with more than just the fragile
ecological balance of these grasslands and their iconic hulking
inhabitants. He brings us into the actual neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   As we encounter the animal community--wolves, prairie dogs,
badgers, ferrets, buffalo birds, pronghorn and grizzly bears--that
populate the bison's home turf, we come to feel the sun overhead and
the wind whistling through the grass.</TE>
<TE>   As poetic as he is, Lott also has a light touch.</TE>
<TE>   Describing grizzly bear habits, for example: "Given the choice, a
papa bear is much more likely to eat a baby bear than a bowl of
porridge," we're told.</TE>
<TE>   And the black-footed ferret, the badger's slender cousin, Lott
depicts as a recluse, haunting prairie dogs' imaginations.</TE>
<TE>   "You can recognize this nightmare as soon as you see its face. The
black-footed ferret's face mask reveals itself as surely as the Lone
Ranger's mask hid his."</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of his story, however, is a call for conserving the
concept of wildness: both the wildness of the land on which the bison
live and that of the untamed nature of the animal.</TE>
<TE>   Even if we should begin to domesticate bison as livestock--they
are, after all, "preadapted to our continent and easy on the soil"
with flesh that "is not as fatty as European cattle's and is said to
be less allergy-provoking," and thus a potential substitute for the
cattle whose grazing has helped decimate the grasslands--he warns
that we shouldn't confuse these domesticated "buffattle" with wild
bison, "the only wild animal in the United States that is not allowed
to live as a wild animal ... anywhere in its original range."</TE>
<TE>   To this end, he calls for the creation of a Great Plains Park
where bison can, without encumbrance, live their raucous lives, where
the real and mythical bison might continue to thrive.</TE>
<TE>   Even if it's too late to preserve the Great Plains as they once
existed, it's not too late, Lott argues, to restore a portion of
those plains, and the bison's place upon them.</TE>

<KH>Spring 2003 / NEW YORK COLLECTIONS</KH>
<HD>Happy Days Are Almost Here Again</HD>
<DH>Designers embrace an upbeat, lively look for next year</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Whether fashion trends are about seduction, satire, drama or
adventure, they're always fascinating for the way they reflect a kind
of group role playing. One season we're wealthy bohemians borrowing
peasant garb, and the next we're aggressive punk gothics in leather.
As the spring 2003 previews finished here Monday, women's wear
designers turned to traditional notions of femininity and cast them
in a sunny light.</LD>
<LD>   Fashion is happy again. It just won't look that way until February
or March, when the lively new spring clothes begin to replace the
bleak and black autumn styles that reflected our lingering despair.
As many designers looked ahead to spring, they imagined sadness
giving way to optimism, aggression fading into sweetness and
innocence trading places with raunch. Instead of scoffing at clothes
that once represented unsophisticated taste--prints, lively colors
and even slips under sheer fabrics--designers have embraced them as
the new signature of cool. By the time the tulips bloom, women will
have a chance to revel in ruffles, look pretty in pink and enjoy
being a girl--except for the part about suffering in high-heeled
sandals.</LD>
<TE>   The shift has resulted in some extraordinary collections that
signal a yearning for simpler times--and more realistic clothes.
That's not to say that these new silky dresses and casual jackets
aren't without complications and contradictions. Some of the most
beautiful clothing to come out of Seventh Avenue strolled through
Donna Karan's showroom Friday. Though her program notes were titled
"To Suit a Woman," Karan departed from the promise of a professional
wardrobe and focused mainly on sultry, satiny 1930s chanteuse gowns,
Adrian's 1940s Hollywood glamour and 1950s happy hostesses.</TE>
<TE>   Karan's timeless interpretations brilliantly captured the essence
of those eras while avoiding the costumey trappings. Even with the
well-padded shoulders, appliqued swirls and matching-fabric platform
shoes, Karan created sophisticated wrap coats and ruffled jackets
that would be credible work wear. For special occasions, she offered
amusing polka-dot or cherry-shaped sequins and lively Monet florals
or Schiaparelli-esque prints featuring symbols of celebration or
music. "I wanted to celebrate America, celebrate the glamour of
America," Karan said after the show.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Adrover staged a remarkable comeback collection that was
glamorous but also full of empathy, anger and hope. In 54 masterfully
tailored ensembles, the Spanish-born designer, who faded from view
after his stunning debut two years ago, re-created the events and the
emotions of the first year post-Sept. 11. This "Citizen of the World"
collection incorporated details that have become familiar
scenery--guard uniforms, the tall-building skylines of major cities
and even the dark-and-light vertical stripes that evoked the World
Trade Center. He represented the many supporting players in the
crisis--with a priest's collar; a United Nations diplomat's suit; a
Hasidic Jew's prayer shawl; an Afghan's caftan; and the New York
homeboy's (and rescue worker's) do-rag, 122 of which he wove into a
floor-length gown. Adrover created an eerily beautiful symbol of the
new reality with an ink-black skirt and jacket quilted in white
stitches to resemble a large fingerprint.</TE>
<TE>   Inspiring clothes don't have to be beautiful to be memorable, but
Calvin Klein showed that not all pretty clothes make a strong
impression. As he moved closer to becoming a bland Giorgio Armani,
Klein's restrained palette of pale gray, cream, white or black luxury
fabrics belonged neither to day nor night. The darts and pintucks on
delicate silks were lovely, but their subdued sexuality rendered them
anonymous. He emphasized simple two-piece, ultra-lightweight
ensembles that were shown on an overwhelming majority of flat-chested
blonds. He must have been trying to impress his guest, Gwyneth
Paltrow.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Klein's tailoring nearly neutralized sexuality (odd for
the man who sells perfume with crotch shots), Narciso Rodriguez used
graphic blocks of color and simple-but-tailored shapes to emphasize a
woman's curves. A loose-fitting satin bra top worn over a tank dress
was modest, but as it moved slightly across the bust, alluring.
Rodriguez showed a sure hand and, barring any financial disaster, the
potential for longevity.</TE>
<TE>   Refined sensuality is flattering to women of any age, a lesson
veteran Geoffrey Beene learned long ago. Like Rodriguez, Beene worked
with the same kimono silhouettes and realigned proportions to direct
the eye to unexpected erogenous zones. While the rest of Seventh
Avenue is focused on waists and bare shoulders, Beene made a
dignified black dress sizzle with a few inches of sheer fabric
stripped along the underside of the bosom just the thing to make a
Park Avenue husband forgive a shopping spree.</TE>
<TE>   Though New York designers turned out many sexy clothes this
season--short shorts, halter dresses, hip-hugger pants and
curve-hugging skirts--the idea of glamour is often a static one,
stuck in Hollywood's so-called Golden Era. In a pinch, many designers
use movie imagery or stage costume dramas to give life to a
collection. Michael Kors, one of the most relentlessly upbeat
personalities in fashion, aimed for an update to Hollywood glamour
and missed. A combined men's and women's show was dedicated to "the
laid-back, sporty glamour of Evans and MacGraw." The skinny '70s polo
shirts recalled the era well, but the collection looked more like
Polo Ralph Lauren than vintage Polo Lounge.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren, meanwhile, proved that he is a man of sufficient means and
imagination to stage his own version of "Age of Innocence." He
transformed the garden of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum on Manhattan's
tony Upper East Side with an extraordinary tent lined with silk
curtains, lighted with large crystal chandeliers and scented by
multiple floral arrangements that were taller than the designer.
Guests such as Elizabeth Hurley reclined on feather pillows to watch
a procession of modernized Edwardian finery--high-collared shirts,
moire jackets, bustle-back jackets and a few shredded blue jeans to
unsweeten the pot. (Lauren is at his best when he's interpreting a
grand historical era.) As he kissed his way down the front row, the
fashion billionaire wore the casual male version of his collection:
distressed blue jeans, expensive watch, white bib-front tuxedo shirt
and black velvet evening slippers with gold insignia. Because of his
own reinvention, Lauren lives more like a movie star than most movie
stars.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles designer Rick Owens lives the authentic, gritty
Hollywood life in his Las Palmas studio. His cool friends may be hot
producers or transvestites; his style may be rough-edged and raw,
delicate and sensual, or all at once--kind of like the moment
backstage when he introduced his gentle mother, Connie, to tough
international style icon, French Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld.</TE>
<TE>   In his third New York show, but the first since an Italian partner
grew his business tenfold, Owens stayed true to his soft-goth vision.
Gauzy skirts and extra long pants flowed under washed and shrunken
leather jackets. His aesthetic mixes men's wear with women's with
androgyny. A woman model wore a more finely shredded version of his
own uniform-overdyed, cutoff Army pants and a T-shirt. While a Neiman
Marcus executive was mystified by his appeal, calling his first show
"passe," '60s model and show guest Veruschka got it instantly. "I
loved the combination of different fabrics and the way he worked them
to look used," said Veruschka, who was wearing floral satin pajama
pants, a ripped apron of metallic gold crochet, an industrial belt,
split-toe Nikes, and a hooded, Army green zip cardigan that she said
soldiers wear as mosquito netting.</TE>
<TE>   To really understand Hollywood, it helps to be from Los Angeles.
South Pasadena resident Richard Tyler, who also has a home and
business in Greenwich Village, can reliably gauge the pulse on both
coasts. He found himself drawn to lush colors of coral, tangerine,
lemon and lavender for the second season of his secondary line,
tyler. Why? "It was Sept. 11," he said before his Saturday show. "I
didn't want anything to feel down. I want to feel up. We've all got
to go on with our lives. In our funny little way, fashion designers
can help."</TE>
<TE>   His timing couldn't be better. Fashion this season features
Tyler's longtime signatures--delicate fabrics, precise pintucks,
pleats and embroidery. Along with co-designer Erica Davies, Tyler
gave a relaxed attitude to polo shirts rimmed with ruffles,
intricately cut out suede jacket sleeves, and unfussy crinkled silk
wide-leg pants, embroidered baseball jackets and an easy, all-white
pantsuit. His line is the West Coast's answer to Marc by Marc Jacobs,
another diffusion line that happens to be a diffuse image of hip
Salvation Army shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   It helps to be from L.A. to understand Kansas City, Mo., native
Jeremy Scott, who moved near Silver Lake from Paris early this year.
With Bob Mackie as one of his idols and inspirations, Scott created
the faux label Jeremy Scott Beverly Hills and a complementary
wardrobe. Try to picture the clothes of a sexy Greek goddess/Jane
Jetson who travels by blimp (which were interpreted as tote bags). A
man of many motifs, Scott added in seashells and feathers for evening
wear, and chiffon and suede for the beach.</TE>
<TE>   It was playful, and at times silly, but ultimately the kind of
great fun that reminds us of fashion's ability to take us out of
ourselves and into just about any identity imaginable.</TE>

<LD>Art in Motion</LD>
<LD>   When you watch cartoons, the picture you see is not just one image
but many separate images. To show a dog running, an artist has to
draw a new picture for every time the dog's legs move. When you watch
the cartoon, each picture is shown to you so fast that your brain is
fooled into seeing one smooth motion. This optical illusion is called
"persistence of vision."</LD>
<LD>   Another way to demonstrate this phenomenon is by making something
called a "thaumotrope." Thaumotropes fool the brain into seeing two
separate images at the same time.</LD>
<TE>   What you will need: Paper cut into 4-by-8-inch strips, colored
markers, pencil, clear tape.</TE>
<TE>   Step 1: Fold one strip of paper in half to make a 4-inch square.</TE>
<TE>   Step 2: With the fold at the top, draw a bird using colored
markers.</TE>
<TE>   Step 3: Turn the paper over, and with the fold still at the top,
draw a birdcage.</TE>
<TE>   Step 4: Tape the pencil to the inside of the paper.</TE>
<TE>   Step 5: Tape the bottom of the paper closed.</TE>
<TE>   Step 6: Hold the pencil between the palms of your hand and roll it
back and forth to make it spin. What happens? What do you see?</TE>
<TE>   Now, take another strip of paper and make a new thaumotrope. This
time create your own pictures. Think of two pictures that would look
good if you put them together. Maybe a heart and an arrow, the ocean
and a school of fish, or the night sky and you flying.</TE>
<TE>   You can experiment with other kinds of art in motion Sunday at the
family program at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, starting at
12:30 p.m. For more information call (323) 857-6512 or visit

<TE>   * My favorite dinosaur is parasaurolophus. I like it because it
did not kill dinosaurs and eat their meat. It was a plant eater. It
liked the water. It had a long nose. Its skin was light green.</TE>

<TE>   * My favorite is Tyrannosaurus rex. It was the second-biggest
carnivore of its time. The T. rex was known as the "King of the
Mesozoic Era." The T. rex was a carnivore, meaning it ate only meat,
like gallimimus, stegosaurus, triceratops and many other creatures of
this era. T. rex is my favorite because of its carnivorous nature.</TE>

<HD>Sharing the TV Can Help Spouses Really Click--or Grow
Remote</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNE MARIE LASKAS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fortunately, I have the clicker. If I didn't have the clicker, I
would right now probably be trying to figure out a way to say, um,
no, I would prefer to not spend the next 90 minutes of my life
watching Jackie Chan grunt and kick with rapid-fire speed into the
eye sockets of bad guys.</LD>
<LD>   "But, sweetie," the husband would inevitably say, "it's like
watching a ballet. And it's funny."</LD>
<LD>   "Uh-huh." And it's a good thing I have the clicker. If I didn't
have the clicker, the other thing I might be doing right now is
trying to figure out what is up with husbands who have not outgrown
their Monty Python stage. I would be sitting here watching the Spam
routine, wondering why I know no wives still at that stage, nor, for
that matter, any unmarried males still at that stage; there seems to
be a direct connection between males, marriage and Monty Python, a
link that right now I don't have the brain energy to figure out. I'm
tired. I just want a little TV.</LD>
<TE>   So it's a good thing I have the clicker. TV-watching time between
a wife and a husband should be a shared time. It should not be a time
when the wife says, "OK, I'm gonna go upstairs now," so as to escape
the gravitational pull the husband feels toward "Junkyard Wars"
and/or "BattleBots." ("But sweetie, this is art!") No. It can and
should be a precious time of active participation and mutual
enjoyment of the TV-watching experience.</TE>
<TE>   So, not even hesitating as I pass some very good old friends
revisiting my screen on Nick at Night, I click to the one show the
husband and I can agree on.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, good, 'Law &amp; Order,' " he says, which is what I knew he would
say.</TE>
<TE>   "Not just any 'Law &amp; Order,' " I say. (The show now comes in
several varieties, perhaps because it offers the one TV formula that
the husbands and wives of America can agree on.) "Tonight, it's 'Law
&amp; Order: Cutie Pie.' "</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise known as "Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent," this show
features a ruggedly intelligent detective who captured my heart the
first time I saw him.</TE>
<TE>   "My boyfriend!" I say, seeing him. "Oh, how I love him. Honey, if
you die, I'm going to marry him. But not until you are all the way
dead....OK? Hello?"</TE>
<TE>   "Shhh," the husband says.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, for heaven's sake. You try and get a conversation going around
here...."Well, what, anyway, is going on?" I say. "Who's that lady
with the teeth? Is she the murderer?"</TE>
<TE>   "How am I supposed to know who the murderer is?" he says.</TE>
<TE>   "She's the sister of the dead person? Or, she's the mother of the
girl who was just on talking about the broken glass?"</TE>
<TE>   The husband is now peering at me over the rim of his glasses. It
is a look that says, "Your talking is causing me actual pain in my
brain."</TE>
<TE>   "Sorry." See, he thinks I talk through TV. Or, he thinks I don't
talk at the right TV intervals. Or something. But I am committed to
my goal to make this a shared TV experience.</TE>
<TE>   I just wish the detective would do his chin thing. Instead, look
at that! Oh, isn't that cute? "Holy perspiration!" I say to the
husband. "Look at that!"</TE>
<TE>   "What?"</TE>
<TE>   "He's sweating!"</TE>
<TE>   The husband, at this point he's rubbing his eyebrows. "You know
what?" he says. "We are getting less and less TV-compatible."</TE>
<TE>   "You want the clicker?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, I want to find out what happens in this show."</TE>
<TE>   Well, no need to get testy. I wonder how other couples negotiate
their TV-watching time. I think of my parents surviving well over 50
years of marriage--surviving, in fact, the very invention of TV. My
dad likes football, my mom likes opera. So this is what they do: He
puts the football game on with the sound off, and she puts an opera
on the stereo, blares it. See? A shared TV experience.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we need to learn better TV negotiations," I say to the
husband. But he's not listening to me. No, he's ... watching TV.
Sheesh.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the show is winding up. "So, what happened?" I ask. "Who
did it?"</TE>
<TE>   He throws his head back. See, he thinks I always do this. Or
something. He thinks I don't pay close enough TV attention. In
reality, I just depend on him for plot summaries. Why wouldn't I?
There are few TV shows that require the attention of two full-time
brains.</TE>
<TE>   "The detective did it," he says. "Your man with the chin."</TE>
<TE>   Now he's just being cruel. And it's a good thing I have the
clicker. Because "Biography" is coming on next. And I'll watch a
biography of just about anybody. And he'll watch a biography of about
50% of anybody. So there is a chance this night may be saved.</TE>
<TE>   Here it comes. Featured tonight on "Biography" is the life story
of ... Jackie Chan.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe this," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe this!" he says.</TE>

<HD>Teen's Mural Shows Art Has a Role in the Marketplace</HD>
<DH>Competition* Nicole Turner's prize-winning montage of Grand
Central visitors and workers will decorate the landmark emporium.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GAYLE POLLARD-TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nicole Turner, 18 and rail thin, strolls the crowded aisles of Grand
Central Market, the open-air cornucopia of fruits, vegetables,
spices, flowers, sweets, meat, poultry, fish and meals that proclaims
it has been "feeding Los Angeles since 1917."</LD>
<LD>   The colors catch Turner's blue eyes first. The so very bright neon
signs--in vivid orange, yellow, blue, green, pink, purple--beckon her
to look over here, pause there.</LD>
<LD>   "You walk in, and there is so much going on," Turner says. She
sits in a shiny red chair in front of the wall where her
prize-winning mural will be unveiled Wednesday. She studies the
jostling people, couples holding hands, children grabbing their
mothers' skirts, and bargain-hunters who are as abundant and varied
in color and shape as the potatoes, squash, corn, avocados and melons
piled into pyramids.</LD>
<TE>   This landmark, located in downtown Los Angeles at 317 Broadway,
draws nearly 70,000 customers, largely Latinos, in an average week.
Monday through Sunday, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., they thread through
more than 40 shops, buying by the piece, the pound, the bag, the box,
the crate. During the workweek, a lunch crowd packs the place for
tacos, hoagies, stir-fried tofu, Salvadoran pupusas, chicken done a
dozen ways.</TE>
<TE>   The faces of people who shop, eat or work at the market are the
focus of the young artist's detailed montage. Her interpretation won
a competition to capture the spirit of the Grand Central Market.
Sponsored by the market to bring students from around L.A. to a
historic site at the city's center, the contest was open to students
at public high schools in the Los Angeles district.</TE>
<TE>   The nine judges--among them L.A. Councilwoman Jan Perry, who
represents the area; architect Brenda Levin, who is responsible for
the historical restoration of the market; and Ralph Penilla, who runs
Roast to Go, the meat shop started 50 years ago by his
parents--selected Turner's piece out of 30 entries. They praised the
caliber of her drawing, done in colored pencil, and her ability to
portray human character and emotions.</TE>
<TE>   Creating a mural from the picture required sending the image to a
Nevada company for copying. A Tennessee firm capable of extreme
enlargements put the artwork on weatherproof vinyl, which will last
longer than a traditional mural painted on a wall. The Grand Central
Market mural, 14 1/2 feet high and 12 feet wide, will decorate an
interior wall near the Hill Street entrance.</TE>
<TE>   For her work, Turner will receive $1,000. Second-place winner
Shawn Olunkwa, 17, of Los Angeles High, will get $500, and
third-place winner, Daniel Torres, 16, of Belmont High, will pocket
$250.</TE>
<TE>   Turner is a June graduate of Fairfax High School and a
self-described groovy, eclectic hippie chick. On a recent visit to
the market, she wore an embroidered black Mexican peasant shirt
bought at a thrift store, green corduroy pants, a messenger bag
studded with pins representing her favorite musicians, and red
Converse tennis shoes--the same ones she wore to the prom.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing ever since she "could hold a pencil," she once asked her
mother, "Do your hands hurt when you don't get to draw?"</TE>
<TE>   The picture that will grace the market is hers, but she shares the
credit for this award with her favorite teacher, "Miss K."--Carol
Kawaoka, the art department chair at Fairfax. Kawaoka remembers when
art classes disappeared from many campuses because of budget cuts.
"Every year, I had to worry about my job. If the enrollment dropped,
the electives would be the first to be canceled."</TE>
<TE>   She worries less now. High school students who aspire to the UC or
Cal State university systems must take two semesters of visual arts,
music, dance or theater. The new admissions requirement, phased in
incrementally, will become mandatory in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's unveiling, the teacher and the school will each
receive $500 in prize money. Kawaoka will spend some of it on a
flatbed scanner and put the rest toward a liquid-crystal-display
projector that can flash images from the Internet onto a large screen
and also do power-point presentations.</TE>
<TE>   Before she met "Miss K.," Turner hadn't felt a real connection
with any teacher in high school. After an unsettled freshman year at
the visual arts magnet school at Fairfax, she completed her sophomore
year doing independent study and being home-schooled. She returned in
her junior year to Fairfax, not to the magnet school but to the
general school. She enrolled in an introductory art class taught by
Kawaoka. The teacher also taught her in a painting class her senior
year and made Turner her teaching assistant.</TE>
<TE>   And, Turner says, her teacher started entering her work in
contests--including urging her to create a piece for the Grand
Central Market competition.</TE>
<TE>   For three days and nights, the student worked on the piece. She
sketched the five individual pictures that form the montage. She
painted with oils. Unhappy, she started anew with colored pencils. "I
would wake up at 10 in the morning, after staying up all night," and
going to bed after sunrise.</TE>
<TE>   While she worked, she asked her mother not to talk. Peggye Turner,
an administrative assistant at Northrop Grumman, understood. She was
an artist in high school herself but did not pursue that
dream--something she wants her daughter to be able to do.</TE>
<TE>   Nicole Turner attends Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.
She hopes to transfer to an art school, if she can afford it. She
needs more scholarship money than she was offered to attend her first
choice, the Art Institute of Seattle, or her second choice, the Otis
College of Art and Design in Los Angeles. She's content for now,
taking general education courses and a photography class, playing
drums, saving for a car--and drawing "all the time, nonstop."</TE>

<HD>Pretty Woman Moves In, Making Some Natives Restless</HD>
<DH>Julia Roberts joins other celebrities in Venice, where some
fear the city will be changing</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whoopi Goldberg and Sharon Stone have favorite shops in Venice.
Robert Downey Jr. regularly eats his lunch at the Hydrant cafe on
Abbot Kinney Boulevard, the area's artsy thoroughfare. Suzanne Somers
and Kevin Bacon have been spotted, strolling city streets. Jared Leto
prefers to bike, and Julie Christie swings by to get her tresses
trimmed at the local Slave Salon.</LD>
<LD>   "So what?" residents say.</LD>
<LD>   "Nicolas Cage just bought a house down the street from me,"
hairstylist Hilda Moyers said. "It doesn't matter."</LD>
<TE>   But if Venetians have cultivated a cool facade when it comes to
celebrities, the latest arrival has cracked it.</TE>
<TE>   Since getting their first glimpses of new neighbor Julia Roberts a
couple of weeks ago, locals have been swapping sightings like so many
out-of-towners. She's been spotted walking her new black Labrador
puppy, chatting it up at a neighborhood party, strolling Abbot
Kinney. Even taking out the trash.</TE>
<TE>   One shop girl got a call from a friend at the Hydrant cafe. "She
said, 'If you want to see a celebrity, c'mon over,' " Ali Hotmer, 21,
said. Recently arrived from Westchester, Pa., she had not managed the
pose of celebrity indifference, and ran down the street to watch
Roberts have lunch. "I'm still in awe of celebrities," Hotmer said.
In this case, just like the natives.</TE>
<TE>   Residents say that a month ago, the $20-million-per-picture star
and her husband, Danny Moder, bought a two-story, $1.3-million home
and a lot next door (for a pool and cabana) on a quiet stretch of
tidy Craftsman-style bungalows just off the commercial corridor of
Lincoln Boulevard. (As of this week, there has been no sale recorded
in Los Angeles County under Roberts' or Moder's name in Venice.)</TE>
<TE>   The street, one of Venice's coveted walk streets, is lush with
bougainvillea and spiraling morning glories, and divided by a narrow
sidewalk. It's an area inhabited by producers, dot com-ers, teachers
and artists. Many houses hide behind tall fences and hedges. Some
yards are littered with toys, while others are meticulously
landscaped. A few homes sit vacant.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts' move into the midst of all this has some locals
scratching their heads. Venice isn't the first place that comes to
mind as home to America's sweetheart. "Why not get a beachfront
property?" asked Recyclepedia bookstore clerk Paola Lopez, 30. "You'd
think she could afford it." (Roberts' spokeswoman Marcy Engelman was
unavailable for comment.)</TE>
<TE>   Stranger still, say some, is Roberts' interest in an area still
battling significant drug and gang crime. Six months ago, police
named the nearby Oakwood section of Venice as a hub in a national
cocaine trafficking ring run by area gangs.</TE>
<TE>   "For them to move into an area where people are still selling
crack ... it tells us our neighborhood is getting better," said
hairstylist Ruby De La Casas, a longtime Venice resident.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, Venice's gritty side has long had star appeal. Years
ago, Yoko Ono and John Lennon were known to host primal scream
therapy sessions in the neighborhood. Dennis Hopper moved into a
Frank Gehry-designed house here in the early 1980s, a time when most
of his famous friends opted for Beverly Hills. Anjelica Huston and
husband Robert Graham bought a beachfront home and have since become
known as finicky neighbors. (Some residents say the couple's
complaints forced the closure of a next-door nightclub.)</TE>
<TE>   During the last few years, Venice has drawn the young and wealthy,
forcing out working-class and low-income families. Typically,
newcomers buy the neighborhood's modest turn-of-the century bungalows
for $500,000 or less, tear them down and build million-dollar homes
on the lots.</TE>
<TE>   "It's changing the sensibility in a lot of strong ways," said
Janie Hewson, a Venice resident for 15 years. "People who move into
Venice [now] have to make a lot of money.... They have to make Santa
Monica kind of money."</TE>
<TE>   And gentrification--with Roberts in its celebrity
vanguard--doesn't sit well with everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how happy the old-time Venetians are," said
26-year-old Jake Campbell, manager of Scanty, an upscale clothing
store on Abbot Kinney. "Half the neighborhood is into the thought
that Venice would be the contemporary L.A. hot spot. The other half,
the landed Venice people who came to get away from celebrities, are
not so happy.... People think it will drive the starving artists, the
bohemian types, out. That Venice will become another place that used
to be cool."</TE>
<TE>   Venice and its inhabitants are unique to L.A., he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody goes to the Beverly Center and thinks, 'God, this reminds
me of Soho,' " Campbell said. "What I love about this street is that
there are two designer stores, a family-owned barbecue place and a
barber shop. It's not a Supercuts with a Kentucky Fried Chicken
across the street."</TE>
<TE>   He'd like to see it protected from too much buzz, but he
understands that his store, like Roberts, is a symbol of the changing
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm successful," he said, "I've destroyed the soul of the
neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   A couple of doors down, at Audrey's Good Vibrations, Brian
Detweiler inhaled incense, striking a mellow beach-city pose, as he
kicked back on a sofa in the New Age boutique. But mention of
Roberts' relocation set him on edge.</TE>
<TE>   "She should go back to Beverly Hills," said Detweiler, a
35-year-old photographer. "She doesn't remind me of a Venetian....
She's Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   Detweiler feared that the movie star's move would bring paparazzi,
security patrols and higher prices. In other words, there goes the
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The 35-year-old photographer and self-described artist moved here
five years ago in pursuit of learning. "I want to be around artists
who can teach me what the essence of art is," he said. "She's not an
artist, she's an actor."</TE>
<TE>   Hopper, he said, "is different--he's an artist, a filmmaker."</TE>
<TE>   Some residents felt more forgiving, sensing an opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "We changed our sign to say 'Mondays by appointment,' in case she
wants to come in," said Barbara Phillips, owner of minnie t's
clothing store.</TE>
<TE>   Down the street, Pischon Jones, who was wearing a barber's coat as
he sat outside Oasis Barber and Beauty Salon, didn't mind "as long as
she doesn't change the neighborhood," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   "If she comes by," he added, "I'll give her a haircut."</TE>

<LD>Part 2</LD>
<LD>   The story so far: The teacher has invited students to take turns
making a bulletin board display about their lives. Rhonda and Tony
are not very enthusiastic about the idea.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   "Some of you haven't wasted any time gathering up pictures, awards
and other interesting memoirs for the bulletin board display about
your life," the teacher told the class.</TE>
<TE>   Students had eagerly signed up for a turn to put up personal
displays.</TE>
<TE>   "Now for the good part," the teacher said. "Our project for the
next several weeks will result in an enjoyment you'll treasure for
the rest of your lives. We're going to write our autobiographies.
Each chapter will cover a different part of your life."</TE>
<TE>   A slight moan echoed throughout the room.</TE>
<TE>   "There she goes again. Work, work, work," Rhonda wrote to Tonya.</TE>
<TE>   Tonya nodded.</TE>
<TE>   The teacher distributed a bound notebook for each student and
said, "In this book we'll write about various topics each day. I'll
keep a book too and read what I've written."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, ain't that something," Rhonda whispered to Tonya.</TE>
<TE>   Tonya responded by gazing at the ceiling, blinking and heaving a
sigh.</TE>
<TE>   "So what's our topic for today?" a boy inquired.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me read what I've written," the teacher said. "Then you tell
me what ideas it gives for your writing today."</TE>
<TE>   The teacher read about her dad's half-brother.</TE>
<TE>   "What's a half-brother?" a student asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Having the same father but different mothers or having the same
mother but different fathers," the teacher answered.</TE>
<TE>   Continuing, the teacher read, "I remember the arrival of my baby
brother. When my mom brought him home I said, 'Take it back.' "</TE>
<TE>   A boy responded, "Oh, I get it. Today we write about our
families."</TE>
<TE>   "That's it. Include where and when you were born. Tell about your
family members and any other interesting information."</TE>
<TE>   As others started writing, Tonya asked Rhonda, "Are you going to
write anything?"</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe, if I feel like it, only it won't be much. Maybe I'll just
pretend I'm doing it," Rhonda said.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: Will Rhonda and Tonya join in?</TE>
<TE>   Betty Martens is a retired teacher. While teaching, she joyfully
participated in writing projects with her students. As you can see,
she is still writing today and hopes her students are doing likewise.
This story will be on The Times' Web site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<HD>PUC May Have Broken Law in Edison Rescue</HD>
<DH>Energy: If state Supreme Court agrees with federal court
that the agency violated three laws, then the utility's bailout deal
would be void.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court said Monday that the California Public
Utilities Commission may have broken state laws when it hammered out
an agreement in secret last October with Southern California Edison
that allowed the utility to begin paying the huge electricity debts
it ran up during the energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals asked the California Supreme
Court to rule on three potential violations of state law by the PUC
in crafting a rescue plan for Edison. That plan allows Edison to keep
electricity rates at current high levels until the utility's power
debts are paid.</LD>
<LD>   If the state Supreme Court agrees that the PUC violated these
laws, including open-meeting requirements and portions of the
landmark law that deregulated the state's investor-owned utilities,
then the bailout agreement would be void, said Judge Sidney R.
Thomas, writing for the three-judge panel.</LD>
<TE>   But both sides in the legal battle claimed victory Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Edison and the PUC pointed to the court's rejection of challenges
to the settlement under federal law.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates, however, predicted challenges to the deal
would be upheld under state law, leading to lower rates and consumer
refunds.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expressed concern about the uncertainty caused by the
court opinion, but noted that Edison, a unit of Edison International,
is collecting more than enough from customer rates to pay its bills.</TE>
<TE>   "These are very serious questions," said Roger Berliner, an energy
lawyer who represents Los Angeles County before state and federal
utility regulators. The appeals court panel "made it very clear that
they think the settlement violates state law in fundamental ways."</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court panel cited three laws the PUC may have broken:</TE>
<TE>   * By reaching an agreement in secret, the PUC may have violated a
state law that requires the PUC to meet in public when it discusses
changes in rates. The PUC has said it did not violate that law
because it was discussing the settlement of litigation, which is
allowed in closed session.</TE>
<TE>   * By raising rates and giving Edison until 2005 to continue to
collect its old electricity costs, the PUC may have violated the
state's deregulation law, AB 1890. That law froze rates and allowed
utilities until March 31, 2002, to collect old electricity-related
debts. Edison and the PUC contend that these costs are not covered by
that law.</TE>
<TE>   * By allowing Edison to continue to charge the 4-cent rate
increase the PUC approved last year for state-related electricity
purchases, the PUC may have violated state law that requires that
hearings be held when rates are changed. The PUC said it has not
broken this law because it did not change rates, it merely allowed
existing rates to continue.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC said even if the state Supreme Court rules it violated
state laws, federal law trumps state law.</TE>
<TE>   That point is crucial, because the Edison rescue was crafted as a
settlement of a federal lawsuit. Rosemead-based Edison filed the
lawsuit against the PUC in 2000, contending that state regulators are
required by federal law to allow the utility to recover costs it
incurred buying power at federally approved market rates.</TE>
<TE>   A state-mandated rate freeze instituted when deregulation began in
1998 prohibited Edison from passing high wholesale costs to customers
when market prices began soaring in May 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court panel said federal law prohibits state officials
from entering into agreements that violate state law. The judges did
not consider the question at the heart of the lawsuit--whether
federal law guarantees Edison the right to recover wholesale costs.</TE>
<TE>   Trading in Edison stock was halted before the court opinion was
released and never resumed Monday. It had fallen 24 cents to $10.50 a
share in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Edison and PG&amp;E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. plunged into
technical insolvency in late 2000 because of their electricity debts.
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Edison executives said they are weighing their legal strategy but
expect to prevail should the state Supreme Court decide to take the
case. At stake is $3.6 billion of the more than $6 billion in
electricity and other debts Edison accumulated during the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Edison International Chief Executive John E. Bryson was reluctant
to speculate what would happen if the agreement were voided, but
added that some kind of new settlement would have to be reached with
the state. Edison and PG&amp;E are set to begin buying power again Jan.
1.</TE>
<TE>   "We are healthy today....We are solvent," Bryson said in a
conference call with analysts and investors. "The state doesn't want
us to get back into financial trouble and we don't either."</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates said a win would mean lower rates for
customers.</TE>
<TE>   "The federal court killed the settlement and sent it to the
California Supreme Court for burial," said Nettie Hoge, executive
director of the Utility Reform Network, or TURN, the San Francisco
consumer advocacy group that challenged the Edison rescue in court.</TE>
<TE>   Hoge said the consumer group has no interest in seeing Edison in
Bankruptcy Court, but thinks rates could be reduced without hurting
the utility by slightly reducing the return to investors over several
years.</TE>
<TE>   "There is the prospect of bankruptcy theoretically, but it doesn't
necessarily bankrupt them because the state could act relatively
quickly" and propose another solution, said Christopher Ellinghaus, a
utility analyst with Williams Capital in New York.</TE>

<HD>ESPN Leaps Into Spanish-Language Arena</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ESPN is finally playing ball in Spanish.</LD>
<LD>   After considering the move for more than three years, the sports
network said Monday that it would launch a 24-hour Spanish-language
sports channel next year, ESPN Deportes (ESPN Sports).</LD>
<LD>   The move taps into one of television's fastest-growing markets:
the 10.7 million Latino households in the U.S., a potential viewing
audience of more than 35 million.</LD>
<TE>   But it also puts ESPN in competition with Spanish-language
networks that use sports as a cornerstone of their programming and
that have locked up some key broadcast rights to sports popular with
Latino audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcasting giant Univision Communications Inc., for example, has
rights to 10 of the 20 Mexican League soccer teams, including the
popular Guadalajara and Club America.</TE>
<TE>   The Century City-based Spanish-language broadcaster also has
rights to a host of major soccer tournaments, including the 2006
World Cup for men and the 2003 Women's World Cup. In July,
Univision's Los Angeles station, KMEX-TV Channel 34, outdrew ABC's
local station, KABC-TV Channel 7, by more than 2 to 1 in airing
Brazil's victory over Germany in the World Cup finals.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish-language networks Telemundo, Azteca America and Fox Sports
World Espanol also have significant sports rights.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN President George Bodenheimer said the ESPN name's
international popularity would give it a leg up. In recent years,
ESPN has emerged as the crown jewel of the television operations of
parent Walt Disney Co.</TE>
<TE>   "I think right off the bat we will be very effective competitors.
Our brand will carry us a long way," Bodenheimer said.</TE>
<TE>   Univision spokeswoman Stephanie Pillersdorf said the network
welcomed ESPN's move because it recognizes the importance of sports
broadcasts in Spanish: "The entry of any new competitor brings
additional and much-needed attention to the growing Spanish-language
sports market, especially among advertisers."</TE>
<TE>   Media analyst Gordon Hodge of Thomas Weisel Partners in San
Francisco said that while the number of Latino homes with cable TV
remains relatively low--about 40% in Los Angeles--the potential is
huge.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a big opportunity in the Hispanic media space, so
I can understand why ESPN would want to explore this option. Having
said that, I don't look at this as much of a threat to either
Telemundo or Univision at this stage," Hodge said.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN plans to offer a diverse slate that includes major league
baseball, the National Basketball Assn., Mexican college football and
the "X Games" in Spanish. In addition, the network will introduce a
new version of SportsCenter with Spanish-language anchors and the
show's trademark, an irreverent tone.</TE>
<TE>   But "this is not going to be a warmed-over version of ESPN,"
Bodenheimer said.</TE>
<TE>   For the sports network overall, the new channel is another means
to sustain growth.</TE>
<TE>   According to Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., ESPN in the last fiscal year
generated $900 million in operating income for Disney, nearly half
the income from its entire Media Networks group, which includes ABC
network, its TV stations and Disney Channel. ESPN is 80% owned by
Disney, with Hearst Corp. owning the rest.</TE>
<TE>   "In 10, 20 or 30 years we'll look back at this decision and cast
it as a no-brainer," Bodenheimer said.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN is building its programming by leveraging a Sunday night
block of Spanish-language baseball, football and boxing that it
currently offers cable operators, as well as sports it now airs in
Latin America through its ESPN International unit, Bodenheimer said.</TE>
<TE>   The difference is that the Sunday night programs now are offered
when time is available, which often means on public access channels.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN Deportes is expected to launch in the third quarter of 2003.
It will be the network's fifth major channel. The others are ESPN,
ESPN2, ESPN News and ESPN Classics. Bodenheimer said he has studied
the move for three to four years and that the growth of digital
systems allowing cable operators to carry more programming was one
factor in the timing of the launch.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, ESPN launched extensive market research among men who
watch its Sunday night sports package. Some 96% said it should
continue to broadcast in Spanish, more than half said they watch
sports frequently and 43% said they watched either ESPN or ESPN in
the previous week, the network said.</TE>

<HD>Salomon to Pay $5 Million to Settle Grubman Allegations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Salomon Smith Barney agreed Monday to pay a $5-million fine to settle
civil charges by the National Assn. of Securities Dealers that its
former analyst Jack Grubman touted a telecom stock despite signs that
the company was in severe financial trouble.</LD>
<LD>   The NASD also brought a similar complaint against Grubman and his
assistant, analyst Christine Gochuico. Grubman and Gochuico are
contesting the allegations and could face stiff penalties if found
guilty in an NASD civil hearing, including fines or a permanent bar
from the industry.</LD>
<LD>   Salomon and the two analysts were accused of breaking several NASD
rules, including those requiring high standards of business behavior
and barring misleading statements to investors. However, they were
not accused of potentially more serious infractions of fraud or
intent to deceive investors.</LD>
<TE>   Salomon, a unit of Citigroup Inc., agreed to pay the fine without
admitting or denying wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   The NASD alleged that Grubman went out of his way to talk up the
prospects of Winstar Communications Inc., despite having no basis for
his optimism. For example, Grubman steadfastly maintained that
Winstar's stock would rise to $50, even as it sank to 14 cents a
share, the NASD alleged. When others on Wall Street questioned
Winstar's prospects, Grubman shot back with reports praising the
company while "belittling and attacking" Winstar's critics, the NASD
said.</TE>
<TE>   The $5-million penalty was the third-largest ever levied by the
NASD. But it was only a fraction of the $24 million in investment
banking fees that Salomon earned from Winstar.</TE>
<TE>   The fine "is a drop in the bucket" for a financial firm the size
of Citigroup, said Jacob Frenkel, a former Securities and Exchange
Commission official, and suggests the firm may already have set aside
a much larger amount to cover liability in other legal actions.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the action by the NASD represents a major crackdown by
regulators in their two-year scrutiny of Wall Street stock analysts,
and may herald further charges against Salomon and other firms.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman once was among the most prominent analysts on Wall Street,
earning $20 million a year. He was credited during the 1990s bull
market with going beyond the traditional analyst role of simply
handicapping stocks to becoming a deal maker who helped to broker
lucrative investment-banking work.</TE>
<TE>   But as the market began to tumble, regulators launched
investigations into whether Grubman and other analysts misled
investors by tailoring research to favor corporate clients. The NASD
noted in its complaint that Winstar did significant
investment-banking business with Salomon.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman resigned from the firm last month.</TE>
<TE>   New York-based Winstar, which provided telecom services to
corporations, was never profitable and eventually filed for
bankruptcy protection in April 2001. Winstar announced Aug. 5 that it
was slashing 44% of its work force.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the evidence against Grubman and Gochuico are e-mails they
wrote in which they appeared to express doubts about Winstar's
prospects even while they recommended the stock to investors.</TE>
<TE>   In one, Gochuico wrote that "$50 per share is shall we
say--extremely aggressive." In a May 2001 e-mail, Grubman noted, "If
anything, the record shows we support our banking clients too well
and too long."</TE>
<TE>   "He was more than bullish," said Mary Schapiro, NASD head of
regulatory policy and oversight. "They had no reasonable basis for
the $50 price target. If you look at the private e-mails, they
squarely contradict the public pronouncements about the stock."</TE>
<TE>   This year, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. paid a $100-million fine after a
probe by New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer revealed a series of
e-mails in which analysts derided stocks among themselves even while
pitching them to investors.</TE>
<TE>   According to the NASD, Gochuico also privately counseled some
favored investors to sell Winstar shares at prices far below $50. In
one instance cited by the NASD, she told an investor to buy the stock
at about $13 a share and to sell in the low $20s.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint also paints a picture of a close relationship
between the analysts and the company. In some cases, they "sought
approval" from Winstar before issuing reports, the NASD charged.</TE>
<TE>   The NASD stressed that the settlement announced Monday is narrow
in scope and that the group would continue its far broader
investigation into Salomon. In addition to probing allegations of
analyst conflicts of interests, the NASD is examining whether Salomon
dished out shares in initial public stock offerings to corporate
executives at below-market prices to secure work.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's office also is conducting a probe of Salomon.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the bull market, analysts routinely issued extremely
upbeat recommendations and sky-high price targets on stocks. Monday's
action may signal that regulators are turning up the heat on what
they perceive as unwarranted optimism on the part of Wall Street
analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "This case scratches the surface of the allegations of analysts
issuing misleading research," Frenkel said.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon, which is aggressively trying to reach settlements with
regulators, said paying the fine put one of the probes to rest.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement "is consistent with our determination to do all
that we can to resolve the issues facing [the firm]," Salomon said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Grubman and Gochuico defended their clients, who
deny any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Richards, Grubman's lawyer, said his client's views were
consistent with "the overwhelming majority of other analysts" and
represented his "honestly held views."</TE>
<TE>   Grubman sought to downgrade Winstar in early April 2001, Richards
said, but was barred from doing so by Salomon's compliance
department. Still, the stock had lost most of its value by then.</TE>
<TE>   Gochuico's lawyer, Robert Romano, said the NASD complaint "grossly
mischaracterizes" her actions and that she is an "honest
professional."</TE>
<TE>   The e-mails written by Gochuico are consistent with her public
recommendations, Romano said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the e-mail telling the investor to sell Winstar stock
in the low $20s was written to her sister, who was looking for a
short-term investment, not the 12 to 18 months that Salomon predicted
it would take for the stock to reach $50, Romano said.</TE>
<TE>   "A little bit of context here is going to go a long way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup's stock rose 74 cents to $27.57 on the New York Stock
Exchange on Monday.</TE>

<HD>Levi Strauss' 3rd-Quarter Sales Increase 3.5%</HD>
<DH>Apparel: Advance is jeans maker's first quarterly gain
since 1996. But earnings fall on higher tax rate and bonuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Levi Strauss &amp; Co. on Monday reported its first quarterly sales
advance since 1996--a 3.5% third-quarter increase--but said earnings
dropped 9% as costs rose.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco-based jeans maker, which has been in a
turnaround mode for the last three years, said the results show that
the company is gaining ground as it introduces new products and works
more effectively with retailers.</LD>
<LD>   The earnings drop was linked partly to a higher tax rate and
higher bonuses paid to employees as Levi Strauss met its goals,
spokeswoman Linda Butler said.</LD>
<TE>   The company is privately held but reports its financial statements
because it has publicly traded debt.</TE>
<TE>   Levi Strauss, which in addition to its namesake brand also makes
Dockers, said it expects to log growth in annual sales next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on strong retail orders and consumer sales, we're
encouraged about the fourth quarter," Chief Executive Phil Marineau
said. "Despite the sluggish economic and retail conditions worldwide,
we're on track to stabilize sales by year-end, positioning us for
growth in 2003."</TE>
<TE>   For the third quarter ended Aug. 25, the company reported net
income of $14 million, down from $15 million in the comparable period
last year. Sales advanced to $1 billion, compared with $984 million
in the third quarter of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Had foreign currency rates stayed constant at 2001 levels, sales
would have risen about 1% for the period, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, where Levi has shown sales growth in five of the last
six quarters, the company said it has been more aggressive with price
promotions because of competitive pressures there.</TE>
<TE>   Levi also said that its total debt rose to $1.96 billion as of the
end of the quarter, compared with $1.86 billion at the end of the
second quarter, partly because of seasonal working capital needs.</TE>

<HD>Peregrine Sues Arthur Andersen</HD>
<DH>Courts: Software firm blames auditor for practices that led
it to a bankruptcy filing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Software maker Peregrine Systems Inc. is taking what legal experts
say is an unusual approach to the financial woes that landed it in
Bankruptcy Court: blaming the auditors for letting management get
away with faulty accounting.</LD>
<LD>   In a lawsuit filed Monday against Arthur Andersen, the San Diego
company acknowledges that its accounting methods were flawed. But
Peregrine accuses Andersen of fraud, negligence and failure in the
performance of its auditing and accounting duties. The suit seeks
more than $1 billion in damages.</LD>
<LD>   Peregrine also disclosed in its Sunday bankruptcy filing that it
had received a subpoena from the Justice Department. The alleged
financial misdeeds at Peregrine, whose chairman is San Diego Padres
owner John J. Moores, already are under investigation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<TE>   Peregrine executives insist the blame lies with Andersen because
the auditors failed to alert the board of directors when Peregrine
management changed its accounting methods--changes that could have
raised red flags about what executives were doing. Peregrine fired
Andersen in April.</TE>
<TE>   "The board put a substantial amount of reliance on Arthur Andersen
and their expertise," said Charles La Bella, a former federal
prosecutor who is representing Peregrine. "Peregrine's board does not
review day-to-day operations of the company. That's not what they're
supposed to do."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen officials said the suit is without merit.</TE>
<TE>   "Any attempt by this company to try to pin their woes on their
auditor is pathetic," said Patrick Dorton, a spokesman for Arthur
Andersen. "Responsibility for bad business decisions lies with the
board and their management team. This lawsuit is clearly an effort to
divert attention from the company's own missteps."</TE>
<TE>   Even if Peregrine were to win in court, its chances of collecting
any money from Andersen are slim. Once considered the paragon of
public accounting, the firm essentially went out of business last
month after it was convicted of obstruction of justice for shredding
documents relating to its client Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Former Arthur Andersen clients have filed suits against the firm,
and the claims are likely to exceed the amount of money it ultimately
would be able to pay out.</TE>
<TE>   Experts on corporate governance who are not involved in the case
said boards of directors--and particularly the members of a board's
audit committee--always have had a fiduciary responsibility to
question their auditors about all changes in accounting treatments.</TE>
<TE>   "This case is like saying that if you default on a loan, the bank
was negligent in giving you the loan in the first place," said
Chester Salomon, a bankruptcy attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Brett Trueman, a professor of accounting at UC Berkeley who
specializes in corporate financial reporting, said that although the
Andersen auditors may have contributed to the problem, the Peregrine
board also bears some of the responsibility. "At the minimum, they
certainly should have been asking the auditor questions along the
way," Trueman said.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, filed in San Diego Superior Court, names Arthur Andersen
LLP, Andersen Germany, Arthur Andersen Worldwide S.C. and Daniel
Stulac, the lead auditor.</TE>
<TE>   One key issue is whether Peregrine's board of directors should
have known that the company, which makes supply-chain software,
improperly allowed revenue to be overstated for nearly three
years--or whether directors failed to ask the right questions.</TE>
<TE>   Peregrine's revenue may have been inflated by as much as $250
million from April 1999 to December 2001, according to the suit.
Among other things, the company improperly booked sales of accounts
receivables as revenue and created a faulty stock-option valuation
system.</TE>
<TE>   "There were material deficiencies happening at this company," La
Bella said. "Arthur Andersen was aware that there was trouble. Their
client is the [Peregrine] auditing committee, and they failed to tell
the committee or the board what was really going on."</TE>
<TE>   Two top Peregrine executives also served on the board during the
period in question.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen P. Gardner became the company's chief executive in 1998
and added the role of chairman of the board in July 2000. Matthew C.
Gless served as Peregrine's chief financial officer and a board
member in October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Peregrine announced that both had resigned.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner, Gless and their attorneys could not be reached for
comment. La Bella said the blame still lies with Andersen. "As a
group, the board was not apprised by Arthur Andersen of any of these
irregularities," he said.</TE>

<LD>   "This acquisition further cements our control over our brands and

<HD>Tenet Says Earnings Will Top Estimates</HD>
<DH>Health care: Hospital chain expects its profit to be 5
cents a share higher than forecasts by analysts, who say it
underscores the sector's strength.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tenet Healthcare Corp., the nation's second-largest hospital chain
and a bellwether of sorts for the health-care sector, said Monday
that it expects to report stronger-than-expected earnings for its
just-completed quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which operates 114 hospitals, including 40 in
California, projected a profit of 68 cents a share for its quarter
ended Aug. 31. That's a nickel ahead of analysts' estimates and
represents a 39% jump from the same period a year ago, adjusted for a
stock split and a change in accounting standards.</LD>
<LD>   Tenet attributed the gains to strong revenue growth, driven
largely by rising demand for more sophisticated and costly hospital
services, and to reduced costs, including lower debt and interest
payments.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts were not surprised by Tenet's preview of results for its
fiscal first quarter, which will be released Oct. 2. In recent
quarters Tenet has been beating analysts' expectations, reflecting in
part the strengthened hand of major hospital companies in negotiating
with insurers.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet is typically the first of the major hospital corporations to
report quarterly earnings, and as such, analysts viewed Monday's
guidance as a sign of continued strength for the health-care sector,
particularly operators of urban hospitals such as Tenet and HCA Inc.,
the nation's biggest.</TE>
<TE>   "It confirms that the fundamental outlook is still pretty good,"
said Adam Feinstein, a health-care analyst at Lehman Bros. in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's announcement by Tenet wasn't enough to offset the effects
of another dreary day on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the Santa Barbara-based company slid 70 cents to close
at $47.85 on the New York Stock Exchange. Still, Tenet's stock this
year has outperformed the overall hospital sector, which itself has
advanced about 7%, contrasted with a decline of more than 25% for the
S&amp;P 500.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, some analysts have raised concerns that soaring
health-care costs would lead to a backlash against big hospital
companies. But most analysts don't see any immediate financial impact
on companies such as Tenet.</TE>
<TE>   Clifford Hewitt, an analyst at Legg Mason in Baltimore, said
Monday that investor-owned hospitals have been obtaining on average
6% to 8% price increases from commercial insurers.</TE>
<TE>   Coupled with a 2.7% boost in Medicare reimbursements this year, he
said, "they continue to be in a good pricing environment and see
solid growth in utilization."</TE>

<HD>A Change in Strategy for Vivendi's Fourtou</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Throughout his career as a management consultant and pharmaceutical
chief, Jean-Rene Fourtou developed a reputation as a single-minded
executive skilled in rescuing troubled companies.</LD>
<LD>   Then he met Vivendi Universal.</LD>
<LD>   Fourtou, Vivendi's chief executive, has learned the hard way that
fixing the giant media company is more complex and daunting than
anything he could have imagined when he ran Rhone-Poulenc in the late
1980s and 1990s. He is credited with turning the debt-ridden
state-owned pharmaceutical company into one of the world's largest
and most profitable drug makers.</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Fourtou will hold a pivotal meeting in Paris with
board members, after a three-month crash course in running an
international media company. The immersion hasn't been smooth.</TE>
<TE>   The 63-year-old executive, who has no background in the media
business, baffled analysts during a conference call last month when
he was unable to answer basic questions about the company. He has
perplexed employees and investors by sending mixed signals, telling
employees of Boston publisher Houghton Mifflin, for example, that the
publisher was not for sale only to reverse that position two weeks
later. And Fourtou's efforts to obtain a nearly $3-billion loan from
creditors, although successfully concluded last week, took far longer
than expected.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, Fourtou's optimism that he and the new management team
quickly would outline a clear, long-term strategy for the future of
Vivendi Universal proved quixotic. The meeting follows the July
ouster of Jean-Marie Messier, whose two-year strategy to build a
rival to AOL Time Warner Inc. left Vivendi with $30 billion in
overall debt and a financial crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "He [Fourtou] didn't understand the constraints on his ability to
call the shots," said a source with close ties to the board. "He got
out in front of himself. He's a stranger in a strange land. It will
take time. People want to know where his company is going."</TE>
<TE>   That basic question will be on the agenda Wednesday when Fourtou
presents his game plan for the company. Although Fourtou declined to
be interviewed, high-level sources within the company, investment
bankers and analysts said they expect Fourtou to propose that Vivendi
reduce its stake in the treasured French water business, possibly
expand the company's investment in French telecom company Cegetel and
sell off Vivendi's publishing assets. The plan keeps intact, at least
for now, its U.S. entertainment businesses, including Universal
Studios.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy reflects an evolution in Fourtou's thinking from just
three months ago when the board plucked him out of retirement to
rescue Vivendi.</TE>
<TE>   The board cited his strong track record in restructuring troubled
companies, his close ties to French banks and his reserved qualities
that stand in marked contrast to the flamboyant Messier, whose love
of the limelight and Hollywood offended the French business elite.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou's original intent was to dismantle the media empire that
Messier had built. The idea was to find a quick way out of Hollywood,
a place where many French companies have failed, and to restore
Vivendi to what it once was--a stodgy French water and sewage
treatment company, sources close to Fourtou say.</TE>
<TE>   That agenda was being pushed by Fourtou's friend and fellow board
member, Claude Bebear, the so-called godfather of French
capitalism.Yet, on the face of it, Fourtou's plan essentially
preserves much of the media empire that Bebear and others lambasted.
Some French pundits are even calling it a Messier strategy without
Messier. The former CEO refuses to go quietly, and Monday he vowed to
keep his seat on the company's utility board.</TE>
<TE>   However, few inside and outside the company believe that Fourtou
has any long-term aspirations to be a player in the U.S. media
business. Vivendi ultimately is expected to sell or spin off its U.S.
entertainment businesses through a public offering, investors and
board sources say.</TE>
<TE>   "French shareholders will not support an American entertainment
company and the American shareholders will not support a French
company with French accounting," said a source close to the board.</TE>
<TE>   Although several parties, including John Malone's Liberty Media
Corp., Viacom Inc. and General Electric Co.'s NBC, have expressed
interest in buying some of Vivendi's U.S. assets, Fourtou is
reluctant to sell any of the businesses at fire-sale prices in the
current climate.</TE>
<TE>   Another surprise for Fourtou was learning about the complexity of
Vivendi's $11-billion acquisition last year of the TV and film
business of Barry Diller's USA Networks. The terms of the deal and
Diller's stake in Vivendi Universal Entertainment make it difficult
for Fourtou to make any decision on the future of the assets without
Diller's involvement. Diller, whose advisors are encouraging him to
focus on his USA Interactive businesses, which include Ticketmaster,
is in no hurry to make a deal, according to sources close to Diller.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than standing in Fourtou's way, however, Diller "has been
trying to explain the business to Fourtou and emphasizing that these
are good businesses," said a source close to both men.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason Fourtou is in no hurry to unload the U.S.
entertainment assets is because Vivendi no longer is trying to raise
cash quickly. Fourtou has concluded that he can meet his target of
raising about $10 billion through sales of assets, such as Vivendi's
publishing unit, over the next two years. The approval last week of a
nearly $3-billion loan also went a long way toward ending the
company's immediate cash crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou's willingness to change course reflects a characteristic
pragmatism and independent streak that have been his trademark
throughout his career.</TE>
<TE>   The low-key manager is known as a careful, deliberate executive
who weighs all the facts before making any decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very pragmatic fellow," said Michel de Rosen, former CEO
of a Rhone-Poulenc subsidiary. "He will eat his hat if he has to and
he'll acknowledge if he made a mistake.... Like all good CEOs, he
wants to keep all his options open."</TE>
<TE>   Before coming to Vivendi, Fourtou was little known outside the
insular world of the French business elite. "He's not a guy the
common citizen knows something about. He's very discreet," said Elie
Cohen of the CNRS, a research institute in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   At Rhone-Poulenc, Fourtou made a big push into the U.S. through
several acquisitions, including Union Carbide Corp.'s agro-chemicals
business and the Collegeville, Pa., pharmaceuticals group Rorer in
1990.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou also steered the successful 1999 merger with Hoechst of
Germany to form pharmaceuticals giant Aventis. Fourtou, who initially
was criticized in France for his role in the deal, worked hard to
blend the Franco-German cultures to make the merger a success.</TE>
<TE>   "He is not a Franco-centric manager," Cohen said. "He made his
career as a guy who imported American styles of management to
France."</TE>

<HD>AOL, Disney in Talks to Merge News Operations</HD>
<DH>Media: Plan would spin off the firms' CNN and ABC News
divisions into a stand-alone venture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN and SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Top executives at AOL Time Warner Inc. and Walt Disney Co. have been
negotiating a plan to spin off their CNN and ABC News divisions into
a stand-alone news powerhouse, but the talks got a lukewarm reception
last week at an AOL Time Warner board meeting, according to people
familiar with the situation.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal would leave ABC News, which carries high salaries for
its celebrated news anchors, as a minority financial partner in the
new venture, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Although talks have been sporadic for 18 months between the two
companies, they have gained momentum in recent weeks, according to
sources.</LD>
<TE>   This is the closest that CNN, owned by AOL Time Warner, has come
in its two-year quest to forge an alliance with a rival broadcaster's
news division as a way to cut costs.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, CNN has seen its dominance of 24-hour news challenged by
Fox News Channel and MSNBC, and despite a strong worldwide presence,
it has few on-air personalities who equal the star power of Peter
Jennings, Barbara Walters or Diane Sawyer of ABC News, which is owned
by Disney.</TE>
<TE>   Both companies acknowledged ongoing discussions about a news
venture.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had conversations for the last 18 months and no deal has
been reached," said Disney spokesperson Zenia Mucha.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner spokesman Brad Turell echoed those words, saying,
"We have had conversations with two networks and no deals have been
reached."</TE>
<TE>   Past talks between CNN and ABC, as well as between CNN and CBS
News, have broken down over issues of control, with all sides
privately disparaging their rival's operations. AOL Time Warner and
Disney have recently come under intense pressure to boost lagging
financial results, analysts say, and that may be overriding other
concerns in this round of talks.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner divisions are under pressure to help make up for a
severe downturn in ad revenue at the company's America Online group,
while ABC network's plummeting prime-time ratings will result in an
estimated network loss of $500 million this year.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Disney has had a difficult relationship with its news
division. Earlier this year Disney executives, without informing ABC
News executives, were prepared to cancel the prestigious late-night
news program "Nightline" to bring talk-show host David Letterman to
ABC. But Letterman stayed at CBS.</TE>
<TE>   ABC News President David Westin is said to be aware of the current
talks with CNN.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan that AOL and Disney have discussed, the two news
divisions would be pooled into a new company with revenue of more
than $1.6 billion, about $500 million to $600 million accounted for
by ABC News and more than $1 billion from CNN.</TE>
<TE>   The plan calls for AOL Time Warner to own from two-thirds to
three-quarters of the new company, and Disney the remaining stake.
But operational control of the joint news venture might be more
evenly split, mitigating some objections from ABC, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   CNN earns more than $200 million before taxes annually, while ABC
News this fiscal year will eke out an estimated pretax profit of $10
million to $15 million, said people familiar with the numbers.
Combined, the new operation would shave $100 million in expenses
annually, and perhaps as much as $300 million, according to
calculations.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner proposed a similar offer this summer to CBS, which
is owned by Viacom Inc.  But the broadcaster quickly passed on the
CNN-CBS proposal, because CBS was uncomfortable giving up control of
its news division, said company sources.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A White House panel studying ways to boost demand for high-speed
Internet access is expected next week to encourage Hollywood and
others to offer more online content. The report also will recommend
that more workers use high-speed lines to telecommute from home.</LD>
<LD>   After intense lobbying by industry groups, the President's Council
of Advisors on Science and Technology sidestepped calls for an
overhaul of the nation's telecommunications networks, such as backing
the regional Bell phone companies' bid to scale back laws that
regulate their ability to compete in the market for high-speed
Internet access, or broadband.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the blue-ribbon panel of industry executives and
academics hopes to encourage the development of more online
entertainment, as well as online government and educational services,
as a way to lure more of the 70 million Americans now online to
upgrade to broadband, which is four to 30 times faster than a
standard dial-up modem.</LD>
<TE>   "We think this report will be a very significant move forward,"
said Claudia Jones, a spokeswoman for AT&amp;T Corp., which has been
following the issue closely.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the White House Office of Science and Technology
Policy declined to comment on the report.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has been under pressure from Silicon
Valley to implement tax incentives and change the rules governing the
phone and cable TV industries to help boost the number of high-speed
Internet connections amid an industrywide financial meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   Only about 10 million homes have high-speed Internet access, which
is more complex to install and twice as costly as traditional dial-up
Internet access.</TE>
<TE>   Many consumers see no compelling reason to pay extra for
broadband, according to a study released Monday by the Commerce
Department. The average $40 to $50 monthly fee for broadband is cited
by many consumers as the main reason they aren't upgrading to faster
access, the Commerce Department said.</TE>
<TE>   Three industry sources who have seen draft copies of the
president's council report said the group generally recommends a
laissez-faire and low-key approach to broadband.</TE>
<TE>   Besides supporting the development of more content, the report is
expected to call for more research and development of high-speed
technologies, including wireless data networks. The report also will
recommend the government use its clout as a big purchaser of
technology to promote online services that could benefit from a fast
Internet connection, such as distance learning and telemedicine.</TE>
<TE>   In calling for more engaging content, the report could put the
White House at odds with Hollywood and other powerful forces seeking
greater government protection for creative works online.</TE>
<TE>   Although government has little broadband content to offer, a
report to be released today by a unit of the Progressive Policy
Institute suggests one novel approach: encourage the nation's public
broadcasting stations to put their television shows online.</TE>

<HD>Disney Is Targeted in Abuse Campaign</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Anti-sweatshop activists are targeting Walt Disney Co. in a campaign
designed to discredit companies that "cut and run" when confronted
with evidence of labor abuses in foreign factories.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of severing their business relationship with a Bangladesh
garment plant accused of exploiting workers, Disney and its U.S.
licensee should use their financial leverage to force constructive
change, activists say.</LD>
<LD>   Their characterization of events at the Bangladesh plant was
disputed by Disney officials, who said they aggressively enforce a
code of conduct that prohibits exploitation of workers in factories
where Disney products are made.</LD>
<TE>   The campaign is being launched this week by a coalition of
churches, unions and human rights groups that hope they can shame
big, image-conscious companies such as Disney into setting a
precedent.</TE>
<TE>   "We're concentrating on the most egregious problem," said the Rev.
David Dyson, pastor of Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church in
Brooklyn and leader of People of Faith Network. "These companies, at
the first sign of trouble, cut and run and go to the next most
miserable place around the globe."</TE>
<TE>   The coalition wants Congress to ban importation and procurement of
products made with sweatshop labor and to require U.S. retailers to
identify the factories where foreign goods originated.</TE>
<TE>   But it does not advocate boycotts, which can leave exploited
workers with no jobs at all.</TE>
<TE>   Its campaign is focused on the Shah Makhdum factory in Dhaka,
where about 450 workers made Winnie the Pooh shirts and jumpsuits
bearing the Disney label. The work was done under contract with Jerry
Leigh of California Inc., a Van Nuys firm licensed by Disney to
produce the Pooh line.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Kernaghan, a workers' rights activist who went to
Bangladesh to investigate conditions at the plant, said employees
were routinely required to work 14-to-15-hour shifts and seven-day
workweeks but were not paid overtime as required by law. Wages ranged
from 8 to 19 cents an hour, he said, or about 5 cents for every
Disney garment produced.</TE>
<TE>   Kernaghan said workers were subjected to verbal and physical
abuse. The plant was hot, crowded and poorly ventilated, he said, and
the drinking water contained high levels of bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Jerry Leigh canceled its work at the plant and shifted
production elsewhere. About 200 workers were laid off, and Kernaghan
said conditions have worsened for those who remain.</TE>
<TE>   "I want Disney to be back to the factory," said Lisa Rahman, a
19-year-old sewing machine operator who has come to the U.S. to
participate in the campaign. "We need our jobs. We need our work."</TE>
<TE>   Rahman was not laid off after the Disney work was canceled, but
she fears that her job is endangered.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Spears, director of corporate compliance at Disney, said
Disney conducted inspections and found no evidence of the abuses
alleged by Kernaghan. He said Disney still considered the plant an
acceptable manufacturing site.</TE>

<HD>Investors May Sour on Murdock Bid for Dole</HD>
<DH>Food: Chairman relies on familiar strategy of making low
offer and hoping holdings, status ease deal, but offer may have to be
sweetened.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Billionaire David H. Murdock wants to buy Dole Food Co., but
shareholders are saying his offer isn't nearly as sweet as the
pineapple that made the company famous.</LD>
<LD>   Murdock is reprising a familiar strategy in his bid for the
nation's largest fresh produce business: make a low offer and hope
that the combined weight of his holdings in the business and his
position as the Dole chairman will muscle the deal through, analysts
said.</LD>
<LD>   A similar approach won Murdock control of real estate firm Castle
&amp; Cooke two years ago. But not before he paid a 13% premium over his
original bid.</LD>
<TE>   Transactions such as the Castle &amp; Cooke deal, which gave him
ownership of a Hawaiian island, have made Murdock, 79, one of the
nation's richest individuals. He has built a reputation as a savvy
deal maker who likes to tout how he made his fortune without the
benefit of an MBA degree or even a high school diploma. Forbes
magazine estimates his net worth at $1.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In his latest financial play, Murdock seeks to buy Westlake
Village-based Dole in a transaction valued at about $2.3 billion. In
a letter sent to Dole's board of directors late Sunday, Murdock
offered to purchase the 76% of the company he doesn't already own for
$29.50 a share, or about $1.25 billion. He also would assume about $1
billion of Dole's debt.</TE>
<TE>   Considering the current environment of Wall Street scandals and
corporate governance issues, Murdock might find the transaction
difficult to pull off without raising his price, said Heather Jones,
an analyst with BB&amp;T Capital Markets in Richmond, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "This is totally low ball," Jones said. "If the board approves
this at this price it will look like self dealing to the
shareholders. This is a very cheap offer for a strong company that
doesn't have many problems." BB&amp;T is not a Dole shareholder and does
not do business with the food concern.</TE>
<TE>   Dole plans to appoint a committee of its independent directors
this week to review Murdock's offer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is a fair offer considering that everyone's stock is
plunging through the floor," Murdock told The Times on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   He said his offer represents a 20.5% premium over Dole's closing
price Friday. And it is higher than Monday's close of $28.99, even
after surging 18% for the day.</TE>
<TE>   Cost cutting and such initiatives as selling precut vegetables and
packaged salads have helped Dole's annual profit more than triple
from $49 million in 1999 to $150 million last year. But the stock,
like most companies, has been caught in the bear market.</TE>
<TE>   Traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Dole shares have fallen 28%
from a high of $33.85 on May 3 to Friday's close of $24.49, the last
day of trading before Murdock's offer.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock said one reason is Wall Street's fear of what is
essentially a commodity business subject to weather and economic
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "There has always been an oversupply of bananas because they are
so easy for people to grow," Murdock said. "Our earnings are up and
down."</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Dole has lost a number of important licenses for
exporting bananas to Europe to rival Chiquita Brands International
Inc., he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dole's revenue dropped from $4.8 billion in 1999 to $4.5 billion
last year, though its sales have leveled at just under $2.2 billion
during the first six months of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Several major shareholders have expressed their dissatisfaction
with Murdock's plan.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking at $35 to $40 a share, certainly not an offer
under $30," said Tim Drake, an analyst with Banc One Investment
Advisors, which owns 1.35 million shares, or about 2.4% of Dole.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe it is worth more because of the improvements they have
made in the company's operations over the past three years and its
future earnings power," Drake said.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Johnson, a portfolio manager with Aronson &amp; Partners, which
owns 1.1 million Dole shares, also said Murdock's bid was low.</TE>
<TE>   "Even after the run-up in the price of the shares [Monday], the
company still looks cheap to us," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   The portfolio manager said he expects Dole's earnings to continue
to grow. The company also will be a likely winner when the European
Union's system of quotas and licenses for banana exports ends in
2006.</TE>
<TE>   Who else might bid more for Dole remains a question, Jones of BB&amp;T
said.</TE>
<TE>   Dole retained investment banker Goldman Sachs to evaluate a sale
of the company two years ago, but ultimately took no action. The bid
Murdock made Sunday was unsolicited.</TE>
<TE>   Dole's three major competitors--Chiquita Brands International,
Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. and an Irish company, Fyffes--lack the
financial strength to purchase the company, Jones said. Indeed,
because of the problems in the banana market, Chiquita was forced
into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, from which it emerged
six months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Founded by James Dole in 1900 as Hawaiian Pineapple Co., Dole now
sells everything from asparagus to carnations to raspberries. In
1922, James Dole purchased the Hawaiian island of Lanai to expand his
pineapple production. Dole eventually merged with Castle &amp; Cooke,
another large Hawaiian agriculture and shipping concern.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock, through his Flexi-Van Leasing Inc. container leasing
business, gained control of the company in 1985. Later Murdock split
the business into two public companies, Castle &amp; Cooke real estate
business and Dole Food.</TE>
<TE>   He bought out Castle &amp; Cooke--including virtually all of
Lanai--two years ago. Shareholders complained about his initial
offer, forcing Murdock to make a series of successively higher bids.
Even after he completed the $615-million deal, several shareholders
used an unusual Hawaiian securities law to protest the Castle &amp; Cooke
deal, eventually reaching a confidential settlement of their claims.</TE>

<HD>Index of Leading Indicators Falls</HD>
<DH>Economy: Conference Board's gauge of strength drops 0.2% in
August, posting its third straight monthly decline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wires Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A key index fell in August for the third straight month, indicating
that the U.S. economy probably will continue to sputter in the next
few months.</LD>
<LD>   The Conference Board's index, which uses previously reported
statistics to gauge the economy's strength, dropped 0.2% in August
after falling a revised 0.1% in July and 0.2% in June.</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street economists had predicted a 0.1% decline in August, but
rising claims for unemployment insurance and weak consumer confidence
weighed down the index.</LD>
<TE>   "There is a danger that this weak recovery could stall, especially
if the consumer market starts to slow," said Ken Goldstein, an
economist who compiles the report for the New York group.</TE>
<TE>   Stock market declines and a decrease in second-quarter household
net worth suggests spending will cool.</TE>
<TE>   The report Monday came a day before Federal Reserve policymakers
are expected to leave interest rates unchanged. A majority of the
so-called primary dealers expect the Fed to hold the overnight bank
rate at a 41-year low of 1.75% for the remainder of the year,
according to Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board collects 10 leading economic indicators from
unemployment claims to capital spending. Seven of those statistics
were bearish Monday, showing that the growth that was evident earlier
this year had slowed.</TE>
<TE>   Sluggish growth may continue for several more months as companies
hold off on ordering new equipment and limit the pace of hiring.
Companies from Exxon Mobil Corp. to Ciena Corp. announced last week
that they would reduce their work forces.</TE>
<TE>   A slowdown would mean little, if any, improvement in employment
and may delay until 2003 the economy's return to 3.5% to 4% annual
growth. The economy grew at a 1.1% rate in the second quarter and
probably expanded at a 2.7% pace in the third quarter, according to
the latest Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey.</TE>
<TE>   Household net worth declined 3.4% in the second quarter, the
biggest decrease since the third quarter of last year, Fed figures
show.</TE>
<TE>   Three straight monthly declines in the Conference Board's leading
index are generally considered by economists as a sign of trouble.
But a number of analysts said they did not foresee a double-dip
recession.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. recovery, while certainly subpar and certainly fraught
with downside risks, still appears sustainable," said Chris Probyn,
chief international economist at State Street Corp. in Boston. "It
looks as though we're going to get a decent third quarter."</TE>
<TE>   Jade Zelnick, chief economist at Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. in
Greenwich, Conn., also did not see the report as a prediction of an
economic downturn.</TE>
<TE>   "The cumulative drop so far has been modest, not even fully
erasing May's 0.6% surge," Zelnick said.</TE>

<HD>Global Ex-Official to Break Silence</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Former finance executive will testify in a House
inquiry that also encompasses Qwest Communications.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A former finance executive at Global Crossing Ltd. will break his
long silence today to describe to a congressional panel how he raised
concerns about the company's accounting in mid-2001, only to be
ignored, fired and labeled an extortionist by company executives.</LD>
<LD>   Roy Olofson, who worked in Beverly Hills as the firm's vice
president of finance, wrote a five-page letter more than a year ago
to Global Crossing's top attorney detailing what he considered
deceptive accounting practices and conflicts of interest at auditor
Arthur Andersen.</LD>
<LD>   That letter, made public by The Times two days after Global
Crossing's bankruptcy filing Jan. 28, was the first sign of possible
fraud at the company. The Securities and Exchange Commission, the
Justice Department and others subsequently opened investigations into
the telecommunications company's financial reporting and into
possibly related stock sales by top executives.</LD>
<TE>   Olofson, who has sued Global Crossing, will reiterate his
allegations in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce
Committee's oversight and investigations panel, according to Paul
Murphy, Olofson's attorney. He will be joined by current and former
employees of Global Crossing and rival Qwest Communications
International Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the people appearing before the committee today are
considered "friendly" witnesses expected to provide evidence that the
two firms used sham fiber-optic capacity deals to boost financial
results in early 2001, when the industry was showing signs of a
protracted slump.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional officials hope to gather ammunition for a separate
hearing Oct. 1, when lawmakers plan to question top executives from
Global Crossing and Qwest about the bookkeeping moves and whether
they were designed to hide their respective companies' deteriorating
condition while the executives sold shares.</TE>
<TE>   "These companies manipulated their earnings to the detriment of
the public and to the detriment of their employees, who in some cases
lost their jobs and their pensions and their dreams and their
aspirations," said Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), who chairs the
oversight and investigations subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing Chairman Gary Winnick, who has led the company
since its founding in 1997, sold nearly 10 million shares of his
company stock for $124 million in May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Qwest conceded that its accounting was flawed and that
it would restate $950 million in revenue and costs related to
capacity swaps with other telecommunications companies. Global
Crossing, citing ongoing investigations, has not announced plans to
restate any results.</TE>
<TE>   The current and former Global Crossing employees set to testify
today include Olofson; Patrick Joggerst, former president of carrier
sales; Jackie Armstrong, an attorney; and Robin Wright, former vice
president of carrier sales.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest representatives include Executive Vice President Robin
Szeliga; Greg Casey, former executive vice president of wholesale
markets; Susan Chase, vice president of international wholesale
markets; and Kym Smiley, former director of strategic negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Floyd, director of North American sales for New York-based
Flag Telecom, also will testify. Flag is one of several firms that
completed capacity deals with Global Crossing in early 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony before the committee, company witnesses are expected
to explain internal e-mails and other documents that discuss side
deals between carriers and criticize certain network capacity sales
as "crazy deals" that have no business justification.</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood called today's hearing a prelude to next week's
appearances by top executives.</TE>
<TE>   The committee has either subpoenaed or invited six current and
former executives, including, from Global Crossing: Winnick, Chief
Executive John Legere, Executive Vice President of Finance Joseph
Perrone and former general counsel James Gorton, who received
Olofson's letter last year. Qwest President Afshin Mohebbi and former
Qwest CEO Joe Nacchio also are scheduled to appear Oct. 1.</TE>

<HD>Dour Forecasts and Downbeat News Send Stocks Falling</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: War fears and concern about the recovery pull
Nasdaq to lowest level since '96. Bond yields fall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A slew of dour corporate forecasts, more downbeat news about the
health of the economy and fears about a possible war with Iraq sent
stocks tumbling Monday, yanking the Nasdaq down to its lowest level
since 1996.</LD>
<LD>   The threat of a second Gulf War also pushed oil and gold prices
higher, while fresh evidence of economic weakness sent already-low
yields on Treasury securities to levels not seen since the 1950s.</LD>
<LD>   "The mood in general is very negative and most people are
demoralized," said Lance Zipper, director of equity trading for Brean
Murray &amp; Co. "We just have to wait for earnings to come out. That's
the only thing that can lead us out of these doldrums."</LD>
<TE>   The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index lost 36.16 points, or 3%, to
1,184.93, closing below 1,200 for the first time since September 1996
and breaking through the low of 1,206 it hit Aug. 5 during this
summer's big sell-off.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 113.87 points, or 1.4%, to
7,872.15, after recovering from an earlier loss of almost 200 points.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index slid 11.69 points, or 1.4%, to
833.70.</TE>
<TE>   Losers trounced winners by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock
Exchange and by more than 3 to 1 on Nasdaq. Volume was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   All three indexes have been on a monthlong losing streak. Since
Aug. 22, the Dow has lost nearly 1,200 points--although the Dow and
the S&amp;P still are above the five-year lows they hit in July.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the strength of the economic recovery has been
investors' main concern, particularly with the release of earnings
warnings this month.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's news gave investors little reason to believe that a
turnaround would happen soon and left open the possibility of a
double-dip recession.</TE>
<TE>   The New York-based Conference Board reported its index of leading
economic indicators fell 0.2% last month--a bigger drop than analysts
were expecting and the third straight monthly decline for the closely
watched barometer.</TE>
<TE>   On the profit front, JDS Uniphase fell 27 cents, or more than 12%,
to $1.87 after the optical technology company lowered the outlook for
its fiscal first quarter, which ends Monday. The selling spread
across the tech sector. Microsoft tumbled $2.23 to $45.23, while
Texas Instruments dropped 83 cents to $14.95.</TE>
<TE>   Retail stocks fell after Wal-Mart Stores said September sales
probably would come in at the low end of estimates. Wal-Mart declined
$2.10 to $52.60, and Target fell $1.70 to $31.96.</TE>
<TE>   Investors also were focused on what the Federal Reserve would do
at its meeting today. Although the market wants to see how the
central bank handles interest rates, analysts say there is equal
interest in how the Fed assesses the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd be afraid of hearing the Fed say that things aren't getting
better. What you're hoping for is that they'll say that, in looking
at all indicators, they're really seeing things picking up," said
Brian Bruce, director of global investments at PanAgora Asset
Management Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Bond traders didn't wait for the Fed to act, however. The yield on
the 10-year Treasury note fell to 3.70%, from Friday's close of
3.78%, as the decline in stocks and growing concern the U.S. may
invade Iraq fueled demand for the safest securities. It was the
10-year note's lowest yield since August 1958.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights Monday:</TE>
<TE>   * Oil and natural gas companies' shares surged as the price of oil
rose on speculation about war in the Middle East. Another factor
driving the price increase was Tropical Storm Isidore, which slammed
Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and disrupted oil shipping.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P index of oil and gas stocks climbed 1.5%. In New York
trading, the near-month crude oil futures contract jumped to nearly
$31 a barrel.</TE>
<TE>   * Semiconductor stocks dragged on the market after Credit Suisse
First Boston cut its investment outlook on 14 chip equipment makers,
including Applied Materials and KLA-Tencor, citing a dampened capital
spending environment.</TE>
<TE>   Applied Materials fell 74 cents to $11.20, while KLA-Tencor
dropped $1.39 to $26.63. Intel, the world's largest maker of computer
chips and a Dow component, fell 77 cents to $14.13.</TE>
<TE>   * Financial stocks also were weak. J.P. Morgan Chase slid 93 cents
to $19.25, while American Express tumbled 51 cents to $31.27.</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of ImClone Systems, OSI Pharmaceuticals and Abgenix fell
after the Food and Drug Administration staff questioned the
effectiveness of Iressa, a cancer drug that's similar to medicines
the biotechnology companies are developing. ImClone fell 68 cents, or
10%, to $6.06; OSI fell $1.74, or 12%, to $13.06; and Abgenix lost 83
cents, or 13%, to $5.81.</TE>

<HD>Two Dialing Services Prey on Consumers, FCC Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Federal Communications Commission said Monday that it has
proposed record fines of $6.6 million against two companies for
allegedly preying on those who misdial popular numbers used for
collect, credit card or other operator-assisted phone calls.</LD>
<LD>   The FCC sought to fine One Call Communications Inc., which does
business as Opticom, $5.12 million and ASC Telecom Inc., a unit of
Sprint Corp., $1.44 million for engaging in what appeared to be "a
deliberate scheme to take advantage of consumers' dialing errors."</LD>
<LD>   The agency sent out staff members to purposely misdial from
different pay phones widely known 1-800 dialing services and found
that Opticom and ASC failed to notify callers they were using a
different service or to provide rates.</LD>
<TE>   "This so-called 'fat-fingered dialing' problem, where companies
deliberately choose toll-free numbers similar to nationally
advertised access numbers, is not fair to consumers who inadvertently
misdial a number but are not then informed that they have reached a
different provider than the one dialed," FCC Chairman Michael Powell
said.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to contact Opticom, based in Carmel, Ind., were not
successful.</TE>
<TE>   One complaint sent to the FCC was from a consumer who was billed
$61.74 for a 24-minute telephone collect call she received but
Opticom did not identify itself as providing the service.</TE>
<TE>   In one instance with ASC, a consumer complained that they were
charged $10.80 for leaving a 30-second voicemail message while
attempting to use AT&amp;T's service.</TE>
<TE>   The companies have 30 days to contest the proposed fine or pay it.</TE>

<HD>Warner to Enable the CD Burning of Its Songs</HD>
<DH>Internet: Company will make recordable format standard and
offer more of its catalog as singles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the latest record-industry concession to consumer demand, Warner
Music Group plans to offer tens of thousands of songs through the
Internet in a format that can be burned to CD.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement by Warner and online distributor RioPort Inc. is
a significant change for Warner. Not only is it making more of its
catalog available as singles--more than 30,000 songs instead of the
current 300--it is enabling CD burning as a standard feature.</LD>
<LD>   Warner's move mirrors announcements this year from Universal Music
Group and Sony Music, which pledged to make tens of thousands of
songs available as downloadable singles in formats that allow
burning. Songs from all three companies also are expected to sell for
99 cents to $1.50, less than the labels initially sought to charge
for downloadable music.</LD>
<TE>   Burgeoning Internet piracy is pushing the labels to offer
consumers something more compelling than their initial online
collections. Consumers showed little interest in the major labels'
first downloadable singles, largely because of the high price,
limited selection and cumbersome electronic locks that prevented
songs from being copied, moved to portable devices or recorded onto
CD.</TE>
<TE>   The new lineup of Warner songs will still have electronic locks,
but buyers will be able to record the songs onto a standard CD,
effectively removing the limitations. The label expects to make
available all songs to which it has digital rights, which probably
will leave out Madonna and a few other top artists.</TE>
<TE>   The songs are slated to hit the market this month through
RioPort's online retail partners, which include BestBuy.com, MTV.com
and HP.com.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia Founder Indicted</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Two sons and two other executives also are charged
along with 77-year-old John Rigas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HARRY BERKOWITZ</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Rigas family created "a towering facade of false success" for
Adelphia Communications and "lined their pockets with shareholder
dollars," a prosecutor said Monday in handing up a 24-count fraud
indictment that seeks to recover $2.5 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The action came two months after the family members were arrested
at their apartment and accused of running the nation's sixth-biggest
cable TV company like a "personal piggy bank."</LD>
<LD>   The federal grand jury indictment names John Rigas, 77, who is the
company's founder and recently ousted chairman, two of his sons and
two other former Adelphia executives. Based on the conspiracy, wire
fraud and bank fraud counts, including 16 securities fraud charges
not included in the original complaint, a judge could theoretically
put each in jail for up to 250 years and fine each $19.5 million.
Arraignment is to be Oct. 2 before U.S. District Judge Leonard B.
Sand in Manhattan.</LD>
<TE>   "The defendants used many of the most sophisticated tricks in the
corporate fraud playbook," U.S. Atty. James Comey said. He called the
alleged scheme "one of the most elaborate and extensive corporate
frauds" in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   There have been plenty of contenders for that unwelcome
distinction lately amid a flood of massive corporate scandals,
including WorldCom and Tyco International, but the Adelphia
indictment is full of colorful detail and impressive scale.</TE>
<TE>   The Rigases pretended to buy 525,000 digital set-top cable boxes
from Adelphia last year without intending to use them or paying the
$100-million bill, the indictment charges. The purpose was to "create
the illusion" that the advanced technology would boost revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The family also pretended in government filings, in phony
backdated documents and in promises to non-family corporate directors
to pay more than $423 million for Adelphia stock that was actually
financed by the company, the indictment claims. The alleged goal was
to make it appear the company was reducing debt and to avoid a
downgrading of its debt rating.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment includes new allegations that the family members
filed false documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission and that they made false bookkeeping entries.</TE>
<TE>   John Rigas issued a statement that said, "The corporate and
personal reputation I have worked to build over the last 50 years has
been irreparably damaged. My family and I have always acted with
integrity and honesty and are committed to restoring our credibility
and that of Adelphia."</TE>
<TE>   The five former executives named in the indictment stepped down
from their board seats and jobs in May. Adelphia, which has sued the
Rigases, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection June 25, listing
$18.6 billion in debt.</TE>
<TE>   Besides John Rigas, who was also chief executive of Adelphia,
based in Coudersport, Pa., the indictment names sons Timothy Rigas,
46, the former chief financial officer; and Michael Rigas, 48, the
former executive vice president for operations, all of whom were
released on a $10-million personal recognizance bond after their July
24 arrests. Also, James R. Brown, 40, the former vice president for
finance, and Michael C. Mulcahey, 45, former director of internal
reporting, were released on their own recognizance.</TE>
<TE>   All five have denied wrongdoing through their lawyers.</TE>

<HD>Palm Loss Widens on Slow Demand</HD>
<DH>Technology: The hand-held computer maker says it will
unveil three new products for the holiday season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Struggling hand-held computer maker Palm Inc. reported Monday that
its first-quarter loss widened eightfold as sales fell 20% from a
year ago.</LD>
<LD>   The Milpitas, Calif.-based company said its net loss was $258.7
million, or 45 cents a share, in the three months that ended Aug 30.
That compares with a loss of $32.4 million, or 6 cents a share, last
year. Sales dropped to $172.3 million from $214.3 million.</LD>
<LD>   "The market continues to be difficult," Chief Executive Eric
Benhamou said in a conference call with analysts. "It is worse today
than we predicted a few months ago."</LD>
<TE>   Excluding one-time expenses such as restructuring charges, Palm
said its net loss would have been $36.4 million, or 6 cents a share.
On that basis, analysts had expected the company to report a loss of
nearly 8 cents a share, according to a survey by Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   "The revenue was a little lighter than expected but earnings were
a little higher," said analyst Joseph To of Lehman Bros., which does
not own Palm shares or do business with the company.</TE>
<TE>   Palm shares gained 3 cents to 76 cents on Nasdaq. The results were
announced after the close of trading.</TE>
<TE>   The big test for Palm will come over the next few months as it
introduces three new products: a low-end organizer to sell for about
$100, a high-end organizer and an organizer-cell phone, To said.</TE>
<TE>   "The major questions are: How do they manage this product
transition, how will the products do during and after the Christmas
shopping season and when does the company get to profitability?" To
said.</TE>
<TE>   Benhamou said Palm would achieve operating profit next quarter. No
prediction was made on net profit. Palm has had losses in five of the
last six quarters and its share price has dropped 60% in the last
year. Last month, the firm was removed from the Standard &amp; Poor's
index of the 500 biggest U.S. companies.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC Inc. is in advanced discussions with Cablevision Systems Corp. to
buy the cable operator's Bravo entertainment channel, according to
sources close to the companies.</LD>
<LD>   NBC, owned by General Electric Co., is willing to pay about $1
billion for the channel and sister network the Independent Film
Channel, sources said. But that sum is about half that envisioned by
Cablevision founder Charles Dolan, who has come close to selling his
four cable channels several times only to back away.</LD>
<LD>   The channels also include American Movie Classics and WE: Women's
Entertainment. Last year Dolan sold 20% of Rainbow to
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. for $825 million. But Cablevision may have
more urgency to sell now because of a steep decline in its shares and
problems funding its current business plan. Neither NBC nor
Cablevision would comment.</LD>

<LD>The number of corporate defendants facing trial in West Virginia over
asbestos exposure dwindled dramatically after a last-minute wave of
settlements.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers representing 8,000 people exposed to the deadly agent said
an initial roster of 259 defendants had been whittled to fewer than a
dozen companies.</LD>
<LD>   Legal sources said the final number could turn out to be less than
half a dozen when jury selection begins today. But the biggest
defendants, including Exxon Mobil, were still expected to battle it

<HD>FDA Says Barr Must Delay Its Tamoxifen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barr Laboratories Inc. must delay introducing its version of
AstraZeneca's tamoxifen cancer drug, the Food and Drug Administration
said. The maker of generic drugs said it would sue the agency.</LD>
<LD>   Barr sells tamoxifen through an agreement with AstraZeneca and had
hoped to introduce its formula Aug. 20. The FDA ruling would postpone
that to February. If the decision stands and Barr runs out of its
inventory from AstraZeneca, Barr's 2003 earnings would be cut by 5%
to 8%, or 25 cents to 30 cents, a Barr spokeswoman said.</LD>
<LD>   Barr in 1997 got FDA approval to sell tamoxifen when AstraZeneca's
patents on the drug lapsed. Congress later passed legislation
allowing drug companies to claim six additional months of patent
protection if they demonstrate their medicines work in children.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Pomona, N.Y.-based Barr fell $1.82 to $61.83 on the
NYSE.</TE>

<LD>The Treasury Department sold $16 billion in three-month bills at a
discount rate of 1.610%, down from 1.660% last week. An additional
$13 billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 1.580%, down
from 1.640%.</LD>
<LD>   Both the three-month and the six-month rates were the lowest since
Aug. 5, when the bills sold for 1.600% and 1.555%, respectively.</LD>
<LD>   The new discount rates understate the actual return to
investors--1.639% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,959.30, and 1.615% for a six-month bill selling for $9,920.10.</LD>
<TE>   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year constant- maturity Treasury bills, the most popular
index for making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, fell to 1.73%
last week from 1.78% the previous week.</TE>

unraveling six partnerships the company set up to help hide debts
before spiraling into Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a court-appointed
investigator said.</LD>
<LD>   "If all of these purported sales are re-characterized as loans,
then the assets, currently valued in the range of $500 million, would

<DL></DL>
<LD>A $14-million renovation of the Park Hyatt Los Angeles hotel in
Century City has been completed by owners Sumitomo Realty &amp;
Development.</LD>
<LD>   The 17-story hotel on Avenue of the Stars opened in 1988 and holds
a four-diamond rating from Mobil AAA. The renovation included
upgrades to the 366 guest rooms and a lobby redesign by architect
Culpepper, McAuliffe, Meaders Inc. of Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   Sumitomo put the hotel on the market in the late 1990s and may try
to sell it again, said hotel consultant Alan Reay, president of Atlas
Hospitality Group. Several Japanese hotel owners are quietly
marketing their U.S. properties, he said, and the Hyatt is in a
premier location.</LD>

it adds them for the first time, partly because some are not paying

<LD>   Sprint's PCS unit expects the rate of service cancellations to

second period. PCS profit, excluding certain costs, will miss the

production rates and the delayed launch of a washer. The company

cents a share. Analysts pegged the company at 79 cents.</LD>
<LD>   * U.S. retail gasoline prices fell 0.6 cent to $1.395 a gallon in

<HD>European Stocks Stumble on German Political Worries</HD>
<DH>Investments: DAX slides 4.9% and all 17 Western European
benchmark indexes show a decline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bloomberg News</AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>European stocks swooned Monday on concerns that the narrow victory of
Germany's Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in Sunday's election will fail
to spur economic growth in Europe's largest economy.</LD>
<LD>   Investors' uncertainty about the global political situation and
the possibility of war with Iraq also continued to weigh on European
markets, and a weak opening on Wall Street further dampened
investors' spirits.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones Stoxx 50 index--which tracks European blue
chips--shed 3.7% while falling to its lowest point since June 2,
1997. Half the index's components lost more than 5%.</LD>
<TE>   All 17 of the Western European benchmark indexes declined.
Germany's DAX index dropped the most, sliding 4.9% after Schroeder's
Social Democrats and the Green Party won a majority in the lower
house of Parliament. The result is the closest of any German election
since World War II.</TE>
<TE>   London's FT-SE index hit a six-year low, dropping 3.1%. The CAC 40
index in Paris fell 3.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Investing in German companies is risky "because a weak government
means no economic growth for the next four years," said Michael
Browne, who manages $100 million at Sofaer Global Research, a hedge
fund in London. "If you're a bank, your outlook just got worse"
because companies may default on loans.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder may refrain from easing restrictions on firing workers
or cutting unemployment benefits because of the need to retain
support from the labor unions, the traditional backbone of his party.</TE>
<TE>   His scope to boost spending or cut taxes also is limited by
European Union budget rules.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Deutsche Bank, Europe's biggest bank, fell 7%. HVB
Group, Germany's No. 2 bank, slumped 5.7%.</TE>
<TE>   "We have never been so worried about the German banking industry,"
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. wrote in a research report published today. It
cited falling prices of equities held by the banks and concerns about
their ability to withstand slowing economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   Among European insurers, Munich Re tumbled 10.5% after an analyst
downgraded the stock. Declines in stock markets are resulting in
higher investment losses at insurers, depleting their reserves and
forcing some to raise money on the market.</TE>
<TE>   Banks also have been affected, with a lingering economic slump
exacerbating a drop in earnings and prompting more borrowers to
default on loans.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Attorney Probing Xerox's Accounting</TE>
<TE>   Xerox Corp., the world's largest copier maker, said late Monday
that the U.S. attorney's office in Bridgeport, Conn., is
investigating the company's accounting practices from 1997 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The probe covers accounting issues already reviewed by and settled
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, company spokeswoman
Christa Carone said.</TE>
<TE>   Xerox agreed in April to pay a $10-million fine and restate
results for the last five years to settle SEC claims that it
inaccurately booked some sales.</TE>
<TE>   "We just learned of this information today and we still need to
understand the full context of the investigation" by the U.S.
attorney's office, Carone said.</TE>
<TE>   Yorba Linda Couple</TE>
<TE>   Sue Brokerage</TE>
<TE>   A Yorba Linda couple who say they lost $100,000 when Salomon Smith
Barney steered them into unsuitable investments sued the brokerage
Monday in Orange County Superior Court, contending its failure to
arbitrate their claims constitutes breach of contract, breach of
fiduciary duty and fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Oscar and Mercedes Bugarini's suit seeks to nullify Salomon's
requirement--standard for the brokerage industry--that arbitrators
instead of courts hear disputes.</TE>
<TE>   The Bugarinis are among hundreds of disgruntled investors left in
the lurch by the refusal of the National Assn. of Securities Dealers
and the New York Stock Exchange to provide arbitration panels in
California.</TE>
<TE>   The stock-exchange groups are protesting new state rules that go
further than the NASD and NYSE in making arbitrators disclose
potential conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing scheduled for today, a judge in Oakland is to
consider the regulatory groups' claims that the rules are cumbersome,
increase arbitration costs and are superseded by NASD and NYSE
national standards.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys said NASD's dispute-resolution arm is offering to
provide arbitration in California--but only if investors waive their
rights under the state rules.</TE>
<TE>   The Bugarinis' attorney, Douglas Ames of Huntington Beach, called
that "a form of extortion."</TE>
<TE>   Philip Aidikoff, a Beverly Hills lawyer who heads the Public
Investors Arbitration Bar Assn., said the attempt to force the
dispute into state court is unusual, because brokerage contracts
specify that investors can ask a federal judge to appoint arbitrators
when normal arbitration isn't available.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at NASD and Salomon couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Bond Trade Group Seeks Rules for Debt Analysts</TE>
<TE>   A Securities and Exchange Commission proposal that would require
analysts to certify their research reports and disclose whether they
were paid to offer a particular recommendation should be applied to
fixed-income analysts, the Bond Market Assn. said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The association, a trade group for firms that underwrite and trade
debt securities, backed the proposal in a letter filed with the SEC
in response to requests for public comment on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Under regulations proposed by the SEC in July, investment analysts
would have to include a statement in their reports certifying that
their research reflects their personal views and isn't related to
their firms' investment banking work.</TE>
<TE>   "The association and its members believe the proposal establishes
reasonable standards to which analysts of all types should be able to
subscribe," John Ramsay, the group's vice president and senior
regulatory counsel, said.</TE>

<HD>Atlanta Hub Seeks Ways to Eliminate the Hassle</HD>

<LD>Hidden on the top floor of Concourse A in Hartsfield Atlanta
International Airport is a business traveler's haven: a getaway so
private that most passengers walk right past the lone elevator needed
to get there.</LD>
<LD>   The foyer at the top of the elevator can be a little noisy, with
conversation and laughter spilling over from the Budweiser Brewhouse
&amp; Smoking Lounge next door. But beyond the glass doors of Laptop
Lane, the hustle and bustle seems miles away.</LD>
<LD>   The peace and quiet comes at a price: There are fees for using the
outlet's Internet access, workstations and other business services.
But travelers can surf the Internet, check e-mail, fax paperwork or
ship a package.</LD>
<TE>   Of the dozen or so Laptop Lanes in airports across the country,
Atlanta's three locations aren't the biggest or newest. But they are
representative of efforts to give business travelers more things to
do and better ways to do them while waiting in airports.</TE>
<TE>   "At the cornerstone of everything we do is passenger service,"
said Yolanda Clark, the airport's public relations manager. "We want
to eliminate the 'hassle factor.' "</TE>
<TE>   For Dan Malkovich, a network engineer from Denver, a long layover
is the perfect time for catching up on e-mails. He recently spent
$29.05 for 20 to 30 minutes of Internet time in one of Hartsfield's
Laptop Lanes, "staying in touch with the office."</TE>
<TE>   It was money well spent, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that I got any work done," he said. "But it saved me
from being swamped in e-mails when I return to the office."</TE>
<TE>   Hartsfield officials estimate that business travelers constitute
just more than half of all passengers using the Atlanta airport, the
nation's busiest airport. To accommodate them, planners hope to open
a health clinic and are discussing building a workout facility.</TE>
<TE>   "We hear requests for a gym all the time," Clark said. "Passengers
just want something to do while they wait."</TE>
<TE>   Hartsfield has more than 20 stores, including Brookstone and
Wilsons Leather. Other U.S. airports have more retail
businesses--Pittsburgh International has an entire shopping center
called the Airmall--but Hartsfield's selection is considered diverse.</TE>
<TE>   Not all business travelers like to work or shop. For them, the
Atlanta airport offers InMotion Pictures, a national chain that
caters to airline passengers by renting small, portable video screens
and DVDs. Travelers can watch a movie in the terminal, take it on a
flight and deposit it upon their return, or drop it off at another of
the InMotion locations in 17 airports.</TE>
<TE>   "Laptop space is nice, but sometimes I just don't feel like
working," said Mack Wilborn, a restaurateur from Atlanta who was
catching a flight to Bermuda. Wilborn rented a player and four DVDs
from InMotion before leaving.</TE>
<TE>   "I can watch these on the plane or in my room," he said. "It's
just a nice, fun service that I appreciate."</TE>

<HD>Back Rubs but No Wireless at Chicago's O'Hare</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT CROSS</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The major airports of Europe have dazzled travelers for
decades--virtual shopping malls offering everything from duty-free
liquor to pet supplies. Chicago's O'Hare International and Midway
airports have yet to catch up, but both are showering passengers with
more amenities than ever.</LD>
<LD>   At O'Hare, the list should begin at the Hilton Hotel, where guests
and other visitors can shop, dine or do their aerobics without
passing through airport security.</LD>
<LD>   A ticket-less stroll through O'Hare's United Airlines terminal
offers meager pickings, including a booth near the Terminal 1
entrance that sells Illinois lottery tickets. Meanwhile, a tiny
Starbucks stand serves as a precursor to the chain's 14 other O'Hare
locations--big and small--to be found beyond security checkpoints.</LD>
<TE>   Out on the concourses, passengers' sensibilities are assaulted
with food and beverage outlets galore. Small outposts of famous
Chicago restaurants, such as Eli's, Berghoff's, Gold Coast Dogs and
the Billy Goat Tavern, compete with the national giants.</TE>
<TE>   On any given weekday, O'Hare is pretty much all business. And yet
the Laptop Lane Internet and office-away-from-home outlet offers just
four booths upstairs in United's Terminal 1 and 11 others in the long
underground tunnel linking Concourses B and C, also in Terminal 1.</TE>
<TE>   "Surprisingly, O'Hare doesn't have a wireless Internet
capability," said Mark Nicgorski, a marketing vice president for
home- improvement and insurance company Hammer Network. "Even a small
airport like Louisville has that."</TE>
<TE>   O'Hare, like most airports around the country, tries to inject a
bit of local personality in buildings that otherwise are largely
steel and glass. Passengers in a hurry to be somewhere else will run
across Artist and Writers bars with blurry murals depicting Chicago
scenes. A food court celebrates Chicago jazz, and a food booth is
called Chicago Salutes the Graphic Arts.</TE>
<TE>   If making the long trek from Terminal 2 all the way through
Terminal 3, weary travelers might welcome the sight of the Backrub
Hub, where customers mount special chairs and get 10 to 30 minutes of
relaxation for $13.50 to $33.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller Midway doesn't offer massages--or quite the overall
shopping experience.</TE>
<TE>   At Hudson News and Cafe, traveler Doug Rouner fiddled with a
laptop while waiting for a Delta Air Lines flight home.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually, when I'm at the airport, I don't do a lot of work," said
Rouner, a representative for an Atlanta-area chemical company. "When
I do, I like to find somewhere quiet where I can use the phone.
Usually, airports are too noisy. The announcements interrupt
conversations. Cell phone signals can vary--they come and go inside
airports."</TE>
<TE>   On the whole, Rouner pronounced O'Hare and Midway "a lot more
user-friendly" than they were when he started hitting the road in
1986.</TE>
<TE>   "Midway, from where it's been to what it is now, is a huge
improvement," he said. "But I do wish the airports had better
restaurants. To me, the food is all pretty much the same."</TE>

<DH>Cheaper Options Put Fliers in Charge, Leaving the Airlines
on the Defensive</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONI STROUD</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even when the economy rebounds and air travel returns to full
throttle, one thing is certain: The nation's major airlines will have
a hard time persuading business travelers to buy tickets without
shopping around.</LD>
<LD>   During the last two years, business travelers' need to economize
has helped erode the long- sacrosanct distinction in pricing of
business and leisure fares. Competition among Internet sites and the
growth of low-fare carriers have given road warriors cheaper options
for booking their travel.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the largest carriers have been reluctant to commit to serious
fare reform at a time when the industry is racking up billions in
losses. Business travelers still bankroll the biggest chunk of its
revenue, and the industry is holding out hope that the economy will
return to the high-rolling years of the late 1990s. To be blunt: The
carriers can't afford to let business fliers act too much like
leisure travelers.</LD>
<TE>   Business travelers are well aware of the wide disparity in fares.
According to the American Express Business Travel Monitor, typical
business fares in the second quarter were six times higher than
typical discount fares offered to leisure travelers.</TE>
<TE>   So it's not surprising that business travelers are becoming more
like leisure travelers, buying more low-fare, nonrefundable coach
tickets compared with typical full-price, unrestricted business
fares.</TE>
<TE>   "Our problem with revenue from business travelers is not that
they're not flying, it's that they're paying less," said John
Heimlich of the Air Transport Assn., the Washington-based airline
trade organization. "They've gotten much better about searching for
prices and booking farther ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Corporate travelers say shopping for the best fares just makes
good business sense.</TE>
<TE>   "When an advance-purchase fare between New York and Atlanta
averages $211 and I can get a last-minute fare at either $98 or
$2,000, something's wrong," said Bob McGurk, chairman of the Assn. of
Corporate Travel Executives' air fare reform initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "The logic used to be that airlines would use a high price tag to
hold a seat open until the last minute," McGurk said. That pricing
model assumed that a last-minute seat would be worth the premium to
whoever needed it on short notice, presumably business travelers with
deep pockets.</TE>
<TE>   "But now with the Internet," he said, "if you wait till the last
minute, you might get a fare that is even lower than if you bought it
in advance."</TE>
<TE>   American Express Co. said low-fare and nonrefundable coach tickets
represented 88% of flights booked by its corporate travel customers.
Only 9% of flights were booked on full-fare, refundable coach
tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Suzi LeVine, director of product marketing at online travel agent
Expedia.com, said the trend of business travelers buying leisure
fares online is only about a year and a half old. "Before that," she
said, "there was much more of a distinction between traditional
business travelers and leisure travelers."</TE>
<TE>   To combat this trend, the six largest airlines have begun
implementing changes that will tighten the system and make leisure
fares far less attractive to business travelers.</TE>
<TE>   Each airline--American, United, Delta, Northwest, Continental and
US Airways--has its variations. But, in general, passengers who have
purchased or will purchase nonrefundable tickets after Aug. 30 for
travel on or after Oct. 1 can change a ticket before the departure
date, subject to a change fee and unspecified restrictions. The
ticket has no value once the flight has departed. Passengers who
purchase nonrefundable tickets for travel on or after Jan. 1 can
stand by for alternative flights on their ticketed day of departure,
subject to a $100 fee.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Iwamoto, president of the National Business Travel Assn.,
said in a statement after the airlines announced their policy changes
that such moves "are going to increase corporations' travel costs
dramatically."</TE>
<TE>   By further polarizing business and leisure fares, the airlines
that have adopted the restrictions could force business travelers to
choose between flexibility and affordability, but not without reason.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Airfare Reform White Paper, issued by the Assn.
of Corporate Travel Executives, some airline executives believe that
when the economy strengthens, business travelers will return to the
freer spending of the late '90s and that dramatic fare reform might
leave them with a less loyal clientele and thus open to sabotage by
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   "The conventional wisdom of airlines is that you cannot cultivate
business travel," said Michael Hall, global travel manager for
Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls Inc. The belief is that there is
only a finite number of business travelers and that "all you can do
is take passengers away from someone else."</TE>
<TE>   But Hall sees Web fares as a way the airlines could encourage more
business travel with prices that would make it attractive to send
more employees to conventions and seminars, for example.</TE>
<TE>   Web fares save the airlines money, Hall said, because they have
almost none of the built-in distribution costs associated with
conventional agency booking systems.</TE>
<TE>   And because many business travelers have found that Web fares save
their companies money, the online industry is expected to grow.
According to projections by PhoCusWright Inc., a Sherman, Conn.-based
consultant to the online travel industry, 1 in 5 corporate travel
transactions will be booked online by 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "The online [companies] see their corporate travel sales growing,
and they want to manage it because the business traveler spends
more," said Lorrain Sileo of PhoCusWright. "It's an attractive
demographic."</TE>
<TE>   Orbitz.com, which was developed by the five biggest airlines,
already has created and launched two business travel programs, one
for small to mid-size companies and another for large corporations.
Dave Cerino, general manager of Orbitz's corporate travel department,
said the programs provide analytical data for travel managers and
also integrate the client's corporate travel agreements with an
airline, so that when the traveler logs on, he or she sees both the
company's corporate rate and all the other fares for the same route.</TE>
<TE>   Expedia.com plans to launch its program for business travel by the
end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, airlines have begun strictly enforcing their fare
rules and collecting fees they once let slide, a move that is being
called "no waivers, no favors."</TE>
<TE>   The major airlines are reducing operating costs and hoping to
boost passenger load factors by taking inventory out of the system.
They will be flying larger planes less frequently on less popular
routes and handing over some routes to regional commuter affiliates.
And, subject to review by the Transportation Department, they are
forming alliances. Delta, Continental and Northwest have created a
code-share agreement that will allow them to sell seats on one
another's routes, coordinate connecting service and honor one
another's frequent-flier points. United and US Airways have a similar
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "Convenience and choice are going down," Cerino said. "So the fact
that I hate the 6 a.m. flight because I have to get up too early and
prefer to take the 7:30 flight because I can sleep a little later,
well, I may not have a choice."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson Controls' Hall said he considered the alliances "a virtual
consolidation" that could result in business and leisure travelers
competing for the same seat.</TE>
<TE>   But that may not necessarily mean either traveler will pay more
for it.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the long term, low fares are here to stay, even if capacity
is taken out of the marketplace," said Al Comeaux, vice president of
public relations at online agency Travelocity.com. "As long as
low-cost carriers are in the marketplace, there will be pressure on
the majors to keep prices low."</TE>
<TE>   In the last few weeks, Hall said, some of the majors have eroded
passenger loyalty with unpublished discounts on business fares. Hall
said the discounts sound good on the surface but in fact devalue
whatever prior discount a company may have had.</TE>
<TE>   The low-fare carriers feel no shame in exploiting the situation.
In March, low-fare airline America West introduced "3-Day Business
Fares" that cost $59 each way between Los Angeles and either Phoenix
or Las Vegas. The fares require a three-day advance purchase, no
Saturday-night stay, impose no change fee and are fully refundable.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, low-fare leader Southwest Airlines dropped its
highest, last-minute fare of $399 each way by $100. At low-fare
upstart JetBlue Airways, which made its inaugural flight in February
2000, the top fare is $299 each way, even on transcontinental routes
between Long Beach or John Wayne airports and New York.</TE>
<TE>   Clare Morgan, director of corporate communications at investment
bank Blackstone Group, said she hadn't heard of JetBlue until an
associate recommended it.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, we use it as much as we can between New York and Fort
Lauderdale," she said. "It goes back to the basics: a quality
product, a good price and strong customer service."</TE>
<TE>   JetBlue has proved that if the airlines simplify their fare
structure and reduce or eliminate restrictions, "people will pay
more, and pay it more often," said consumer advocate Joe Brancatelli.
"JetBlue's fares only look lower because they can be understood."</TE>
<TE>   Brancatelli said that although US Airways had fares ranging from
two to four figures, most of the tickets it sells are in the same
range as JetBlue's. "But now," he said, "JetBlue has driven US
Airways out of the New York-Florida market."</TE>
<TE>   That leaves the Big Six with another problem.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, said
recently at a business travel forum that "the conundrum major
airlines face is that if they lower business air fares right now,
without addressing structural cost and productivity problems, their
losses will deepen."</TE>
<TE>   The low-fare carriers make up about 20% of the market and might
not increase substantially. But the ATA's Heimlich said business
travelers won't be satisfied with a system that has only low-cost
carriers.</TE>
<TE>   "They do not serve certain markets--international, smaller
communities--so people will always need the network that the majors
supply," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And though many business travelers seem convinced that the majors'
current fare structure is depressing legitimate business travel
demand, those airlines seem to think dramatic reform is risky.</TE>
<TE>   "What if we go to a simpler fare structure and still lose money?"
Heimlich asked. "Everyone likes simple things in life, but does that
necessarily mean you will buy more?"</TE>
<TE>   McGurk of the Assn. of Corporate Travel Executives suggested that
too much emphasis is placed on labeling some fares for business
travelers and others for leisure.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as I meet the purchase requirements, what difference does
it make to the airlines whether I'm going to New York on business or
to visit my kids?"</TE>

<DH>Loyalty translates to royalty for frequent travelers, as
hotel operators pile on perks and pampering</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When dozens of engineers and salespeople at Loronix Information
Systems began requesting the same hotel chain for accommodations
while on the road this year, corporate travel manager Kathy Darnell
said she had to find out what was up.</LD>
<LD>   "I wondered what they were getting out of it," Darnell said of the
Durango, Colo.-based company's 150 frequent travelers. "These weren't
luxury hotels or anything, and they didn't have exorbitant rates. But
suddenly they were very popular around here, and I had a whole bunch
of people wanting to stay there."</LD>
<LD>   With business travel still down 30% to 40% from a year ago and
companies continuing to restrict travel budgets in a soft economy,
the hotel industry has been forced to react in an unfamiliar way:
compete like never before for a dwindling segment of guests that has
long generated plenty of new business to go around.</LD>
<TE>   For most hotels, business travelers--who usually pay the highest
room rates--account for at least half of the overall guests, and
loyal companies are routinely rewarded with meal credits, preferred
rooms or other perks. But service, for the most part, has stayed the
same.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as leisure travelers continue to trickle back without too
much prodding and convention business continues to show steady
recovery, hotel operators have realized they have to do more to
attract business travelers.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, hotels have been able to rely on new demand in the
business sector for so long that many simply don't know how to
compete now," said Sean Hennessey, director of hospitality practice
for PricewaterhouseCoopers. "But if their service is not going over
and beyond to keep business travelers happy, they should know someone
else's is. For once, business travelers rule. Whatever they want,
they can get, and I'm not just talking about mints on their pillows."</TE>
<TE>   From luggage-free travel services to free long-distance
phone calls, business travelers are enjoying a host of new pampering
programs designed to keep them checking in.</TE>
<TE>   At Wyndham International hotels, the chain Darnell said her
traveling staff now prefers, individualized service is the focus.
Besides high-speed Internet access in every room, the hotels have
business travelers fill out a profile of personal
preferences--including pillow types, preferred magazines and ideal
room temperature. Upon arrival, guests find their rooms appointed to
their specifications, with their favorite snacks and beverages
waiting.</TE>
<TE>   If they visit a particular Wyndham hotel regularly, business
travelers also can opt to leave a supply of clothes and toiletries
behind for their return, when the items will be cleaned and waiting
for them in their room.</TE>
<TE>   "Our guys love it," Darnell said. "If they have to travel these
days, they just want a little extra comfort. I don't think it's too
much to ask."</TE>
<TE>   More than 500,000 business travelers have filled out the personal
profile and joined Wyndham's frequent-traveler program since it began
this year, said Dave Johnson, chief marketing officer of the
Dallas-based company. In June, when Wyndham announced that free
long-distance phone calls would be standard for business travelers,
membership spiked dramatically, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We strongly believe that unless you're offering individualized
service that really caters to each and every business traveler,
you're not going to make it," said Johnson, noting that business
travelers account for a third of Wyndham's guests.</TE>
<TE>   Although the free long-distance calling is an added expense for
the 167-property national hotel chain, Johnson said revenue in that
area was already shrinking as companies insisted that employees use
cell phones for business calls instead of racking up hefty charges in
hotels. By offering free calls, Wyndham attracted more business
travelers who will potentially become loyal guests, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going after them any way we can," he said. "And we're going
to keep them happy once they get here."</TE>
<TE>   In that sense, many business travelers say it's a great time to be
a frequent traveler.</TE>
<TE>   Shinobu Toyoda, a San Francisco-based entertainment executive for
Sega Corp., said he spends no fewer than 200 nights a year in hotels
throughout the world and takes about 100 flights a year within the
U.S. He has noticed obvious service improvements (complimentary
bottles of wine and fruit baskets) as well as more subtle changes
(speedier checkouts or extra smiles from the hotel staff).</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like hotels have started to ask the question, 'What
can I do for you?' " Toyoda said during a recent visit to Los
Angeles. "They always asked that before, of course, but it was
superficially. Now they mean it because they're doing whatever they
can to make it better."</TE>
<TE>   While in L.A., Toyoda stayed at the Wyndham Bel Age in West
Hollywood as usual--"not the most luxurious hotel in terms of
appearance"--but one that he feels knows him. Besides high-speed
Internet service, Toyoda said, he has only a few simple needs while
on the road. One is a glass of red wine before he turns in at night,
something that is always waiting for him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very minor detail," Toyoda said. "But it's the feeling you
get. You're being remembered. You're being taken care of."</TE>
<TE>   Other hotels have launched programs designed to show business
travelers how valued they are. At W hotels, for example, its program
guarantees any request at any time--or the guest's final bill will be
credited. A comic book at midnight, an in-room massage at dawn--hotel
workers are on call to make sure it happens, no questions asked. And
some guests are finding they don't necessarily have to make a formal
request for a service to come through.</TE>
<TE>   "I casually mentioned to the front desk worker one night that I
knew I was going to have trouble sleeping, and within 10 minutes I
had a complimentary tray of bedtime tea and aromatherapy lotion in my
room," said Monica Hosack, a pharmaceutical saleswoman who recently
stayed at the W hotel in San Francisco. "It was amazing. I've never
had anything like that happen to me anywhere. And I travel a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Sheraton hotels recently started a similar program that
compensates guests who complain of slow room service or lumpy
mattresses, something officials said they hope will boost the chain's
image and make the properties more uniform when it comes to service.
Business travelers account for 60% of Sheraton's total guests.</TE>
<TE>   "[Business travelers] have always had a wide array of choices out
there," said Geoff Ballotti, executive vice president of hotel
operations for Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide Inc., which in
addition to the Sheraton brand runs St. Regis and W hotels. "But they
have become more demanding and discerning over the years, and this
year they are absolutely 100% in charge of the whole entire show."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some hotels are not meeting customers' expectations in the
business travel market, according to a recent hotel guest
satisfaction survey conducted by J.D. Power &amp; Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Although satisfaction increased in four of the six hotel price
groups, guests were less satisfied with service at mid-scale hotels
such as Holiday Inn and Hampton Inn and economy hotels such as Ramada
and Super 8, said Linda Hirneise, executive director of the hotel
practice at J.D. Power &amp; Associates. The sixth annual survey, which
examined 52 hotel brands, is based on responses from 13,000 frequent
business travelers.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, the upscale segment is far exceeding business
travelers' expectations right now," Hirneise said. "So unless other
hotel chains join in, they're going to see guests start voting with
their feet."</TE>
<TE>   Hirneise said the survey showed that small touches matter most to
business travelers, which should give all hotel chains room to
compete. When ranking the services that are most important,
respondents listed "showing appreciation of business travelers' time"
and "ensuring accuracy in the reservation and a problem-free
experience" at the top.</TE>
<TE>   More than half of those polled also said they wanted complimentary
bottled water in their rooms--an amenity that few are getting,
Hirneise said.</TE>
<TE>   "That sounds like such a small deal," she said. "But if one out of
two guests are saying they want it, I'd say it's pretty huge."</TE>
<TE>   Such attention to simple details is so important that some
business travelers say hotels needn't go overboard. When staying at a
Westin hotel in Arizona last month, computer programmer Shane Watkins
said the general manager offered to go grocery shopping for him
because he mentioned he had forgotten a few things for the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it was a nice gesture," said Watkins, who lives in San
Jose. "But I really don't need a stranger picking out my deodorant. I
passed."</TE>

<HD>Smaller Firms Turning to the Net for Tickets</HD>
<DH>Travelocity, Orbitz and Expedia say about a third of their
sales come from businesses that lack corporate travel offices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE FISHMAN</AU>
<BD>STAMFORD ADVOCATE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Heidi Galli, who is in charge of arranging travel plans for employees
at a small software development firm, can't recount the last time she
booked an unrestricted, full-price airline ticket.</LD>
<LD>   That's because she never has.</LD>
<LD>   Galli, director of administration for SmartEquip Inc., a
2-year-old firm in Norwalk, Conn., that develops software for
equipment rental companies and distributors, seeks only discounted
Web fares to book company travel.</LD>
<TE>   SmartEquip is among a growing number of small to medium-sized
businesses that are eschewing corporate travel agents and turning to
discounted air fares offered via the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Although many large businesses remain tied to their corporate
travel offices, the unmanaged business travel segment is a valuable
market for online travel companies.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the biggest online travel agents--Travelocity, Orbitz and
Expedia--attribute about a third of their sales to the unmanaged
business market, said Lorraine Sileo, an analyst with travel research
firm PhoCusWright.</TE>
<TE>   According to a PhoCusWright forecast, leisure and business
travelers will spend $28.4 billion on online bookings this year. Of
that number, about $10 billion will come from the business traveler,
Sileo said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the potential for sales growth, Internet travel agents
and suppliers are trying to make the online experience more
convenient for their business travel clients</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Travelocity launched a business travel center that
offers personalized services such as Repeat a Trip--in which a
traveler rebooking the same route can do so with one mouse click--and
automatically alerting a traveler by e-mail or telephone if his or
her flight is delayed.</TE>
<TE>   Orbitz and Expedia operate business sites with similar features.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet travel industry also seeks to capitalize on another
growing segment--the "rogue" or "leakage" customer who works for a
large corporation and defies company policy by booking low-cost
online travel arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   The National Business Travel Assn., which represents corporate
travel managers, says more than half its members restrict their
employees from seeking fares--even a cheaper one--on the Internet
because it hinders their ability to manage travel programs.</TE>
<TE>   When an employee purchases an airline ticket online, in most cases
the purchase does not count toward a corporation's negotiated
contract with a supplier.</TE>
<TE>   Travelocity sees several big-name companies, with thousands of
employees, going to its Web site, said Michael Stacy, senior vice
president of marketing for the Fort Worth-based company.</TE>
<TE>   "We can see they are looking at our site, looking up fares," he
said. Then, he said, they call their corporate travel office to see
if company agents can match the fare.</TE>

<HD>Better Travel, From the Ground Up</HD>
<DH>Airports around the country are adding amenities and
working creatively to try to enhance business flying--well before
takeoff</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In true Hollywood form, Los Angeles International Airport has added
several amenities during the last year to keep business travelers
entertained--as well as fully connected.</LD>
<LD>   The Gate Escape is a full-service cyberport in Terminal 8 that
lets passengers access a high-speed T1 Internet connection from
private cubicles with flat-screen monitors.</LD>
<LD>   For $5 for the first 15 minutes, guests can check their e-mail,
surf the Internet or work on projects. They can watch movies or
television from a DirecTV satellite service or get free traveler
information through the computers. Guests also can send or receive
faxes, ship or print documents, make photocopies or buy office
supplies.</LD>
<TE>   Two more Gate Escapes recently opened at the Tom Bradley
International Terminal and Terminal 7.</TE>
<TE>   Given that business travelers account for more than half of LAX's
67 million passengers each year, airport officials have made finding
new ways to accommodate them a priority, even as the city has begun
debate on a $10-billion plan to modernize the aging complex.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal, put forth by Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn this
year, would entail a dramatic reworking of the airport, including the
demolition of four terminals and the removal of all cars in the
central terminal area.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we're an older airport and we're lacking in the square
footage that others have to do more for business travelers," said
Paul Haney, an airport spokesman. "But we still have some pretty neat
stuff going on. And our concession revenues show what we're doing is
really working."</TE>
<TE>   After the terrorist attacks, airlines, concessionaires and other
tenants at LAX reduced their staffs by 10,000 workers. Since then,
however, food, beverage and retail revenue has increased every month.
As of May, total concession revenue topped $20 million--about flat
with the previous year's figure, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   LAX offers a wide variety of eateries and shops, including three
Sunglass Hut locations where passengers can get into the L.A. spirit
with $200 Oakley sunglasses and other items.</TE>
<TE>   Airport officials credit the business-related additions with
helping to boost sales.</TE>
<TE>   The Travel Right Cafe in American Airlines' terminal is an upscale
cocktail lounge and deli with tableside data-port jacks and
electrical outlets that allow customers to use laptops or recharge
cellular phones at no charge.</TE>
<TE>   The cafe, in Terminal 4, has 48 ports to accommodate as many as 68
users and offers sandwiches and salads from Boudin's Sourdough
Bakery, chili, sushi and a full bar.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our first concession at LAX that lets you eat, drink and
stay connected," said Ramon Olivares, the airport's concession
management director. "That's what L.A. is all about."</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Metro Airports Entice With Upscale Shops</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA SHEA</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was hardly the typical airport impulse buy. An Ohio businessman
connecting through LaGuardia Airport recently bought a $1,700
mattress at the Central Terminal's Brookstone outpost after
stretching out on the display model.</LD>
<LD>   Two soft leather massage loungers outside the store along the
airport concourse usually entice more "tryers" than buyers.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we'll spend the two hours we have to kill right here,"
said Ed Patterson of Hilton Head, S.C., as he and his wife, Peggi,
sank into the $1,300 and $3,200 chairs between flights.</LD>
<TE>   But savvy frequent travelers buy after prices are slashed on the
demos, Brookstone sales associate Zanitta Whitworth said.</TE>
<TE>   The store's bestsellers remain travel items such as mini-pillows,
luggage locks and compact bags (often bought on a dash back from the
boarding gate after a carry-on is ruled too large). Still,
Brookstone's product range in its new LaGuardia MarketPlace location
exemplifies the expanding shopping options there and at the two other
major New York metro area airports--Kennedy International and the
recently renamed Newark-Liberty International.</TE>
<TE>   Cavernous glass-and-metal terminal concourses that look like a
combination airplane hangar and suburban mall offer spa services,
designer food and fashions, museum merchandise, high-end jewelry and
live music. The object is to entice increasingly sophisticated
travelers, who lately have had more airport "dwell time" on their
hands because of earlier check-in requirements, less frequent
connecting flights and unpredictable gridlock at security checkpoints
since the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The global trend toward upgrading airport retailing by providing a
mix of trusted local and international brands was a late arrival at
New York-area airports because their older terminals often are harder
or costlier to redesign. But if they seem continuously under
renovation, it's because they are. That's progress, said Carlo
Bianchi of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which
operates the three airports.</TE>
<TE>   "Once construction stops," he said, "it's like there's no future."</TE>
<TE>   (The most obvious projects are at Kennedy: two new American
Airlines terminals, opening in 2003 and 2005, and the long-awaited
AirTrain monorail, also scheduled to open in stages--the airport loop
by the end of the year; the link to the rail hub in Jamaica, Queens,
early in the spring.)</TE>
<TE>   LaGuardia and Kennedy offer business centers where travelers can
rent an equipped office cubicle. At all three airports, passengers
hunch over laptops in food courts or anywhere there's a seat and a
wall outlet or a phone with a data port.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers don't need an airline club membership to enjoy a glass
of premium wine or a fresh microbrew, as bright theme cafes replace
dingy airport saloons (four in the LaGuardia MarketPlace should be
transformed by year's end--one called Newsbreak plans a bar-long
stock ticker).</TE>
<TE>   As for food, the metro airport benchmark is celebrity chef Todd
English's Figs LaGuardia, offering table service plus a stylish pizza
bar around an open oven with roaring fire.</TE>
<TE>   It was a welcome respite for sisters Molly O'Connor and Joan
Clough, who stopped for a leisurely lunch of buffalo wings and the
signature fig-and-prosciutto pie before going home to Kansas City,
Mo., after a recent New York buying trip for their mother's
consignment shop.</TE>

<HD>Pricing, Position in Flux at Rental Car Firms</HD>
<DH>The loss of business travelers and cutbacks, consolidation
and Chapter 11 filings continue to be felt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN SOLOMON</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just as with air fares, the Internet is helping to level the playing
field when it comes to the price of renting a car.</LD>
<LD>   But the rental car business remains intensely competitive, and
pricing varies from market to market.</LD>
<LD>   For example, using company Web sites, a traveler could rent a
mid-size car at Denver International Airport, for use Monday through
Friday in mid-September and with unlimited mileage, for $392 at Avis,
$359 at Hertz, $335 at National, $231 at Budget and $202 at Thrifty.</LD>
<TE>   Changing the parameters a bit, the same car rented at Cincinnati's
airport, for use Friday through Sunday in mid-September, would cost
$64 at Hertz and Avis, $81 at Thrifty and $72 at Budget. National, in
the middle of the price range for the weekday rental in Denver, was
lowest in Cincinnati at $44.</TE>
<TE>   What does this all mean? A couple of things. Unless your firm has
an agreement with a particular rental company and sends all its
business there, finding the best rate can be a crapshoot. And that's
appropriate, because with the possible exception of Las Vegas hotels,
there may be no more competitive segment in the travel industry than
rental cars.</TE>
<TE>   "It really, really, truly is," said Chris Payne, manager of
corporate communications at Thrifty. "And it's very much played out
on a market-by-market basis."</TE>
<TE>   In that respect, pricing and positioning of rental car brands have
more in common with those of the airline industry: There's Hertz,
Avis and National as the American Airlines and United Airlines of the
rental car world, and value- oriented Thrifty, Budget and Alamo as
the companies most like low-fare king Southwest Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   For a time last year, none of those distinctions mattered much.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of crisis response," Ted Deutsch, vice president
of corporate affairs at Avis, said of the post-Sept. 11 period. "For
a few days, we opened our system to one-way rentals, let our cars go
all over the country, dropped all charges associated with that and
made it our mission to help keep people moving. Then there was
cleaning up that mess for a couple of weeks, when our cars were
scattered across the country.</TE>
<TE>   "And then there were a few months when business kind of fell off a
cliff because of air travel falling off a cliff."</TE>
<TE>   "After 9/11," said Thrifty's Payne, "fleet sizes were diminished
quite a bit because there were a lot of cars sitting there. That's
been with all car rental companies.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened was when you shrink the supply and the demand comes
back ... that's why you've been seeing some price increases."</TE>
<TE>   Although prices surged last winter, they since have settled back
down.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, we're about comparable to where we were a year ago,"
before 9/11, Deutsch said. "Historically, price in the rental car
industry has not even kept pace with inflation--and we're one of the
few industries that can make that dubious claim.</TE>
<TE>   "So the fact that you now find prices higher than they were six
months ago or 10 months ago reflects more what a low we reached
post-9/11 than any great increase in general."</TE>
<TE>   Tremors in the industry--the sudden loss of customers, especially
business customers, and the cutbacks, consolidations and Chapter 11
bankruptcy filings by National and Alamo--continue to be felt as
companies adjust to what may be a new reality.</TE>
<TE>   "You've seen the airline industry's numbers, and we're not immune
from that," said Rich Broome, Hertz's vice president of corporate
affairs. "If you break the numbers down more closely, since last
October the falloff has been more on the business side. The leisure
segment has been pretty resilient."</TE>
<TE>   So Hertz, usually about evenly split between business and leisure
customers, is looking to another segment as business travel continues
to lag.</TE>
<TE>   "We've made a significant investment in the off-airport
market-opening locations, trying to service suburban business and the
insurance replacement business as a source of future revenue. With
some of the changes in the travel industry recently, it looks like it
was a good idea."</TE>
<TE>   Avis, like Hertz heavily dependent on business travelers, already
had been shifting some of its focus to the leisure side.</TE>
<TE>   "That was in the works a year, 18 months ago," Deutsch said, "and
probably took on a little speed and urgency. We were kind of fishing
where the fish were."</TE>
<TE>   Thrifty, already aimed at the leisure market, was pretty much
where it needed to be.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still leisure travelers out there who want to reward
themselves," Payne said, "but business travel's a whole different
matter. There's still a lot of uncertainty out there--kind of a sense
of just waiting for the other shoe to drop."</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us back to pricing. It is one of the great mysteries
of the rental car business.</TE>
<TE>   For example: Why would someone pay nearly twice as much for an
Avis car than for essentially the same vehicle from Thrifty?</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's a very different experience when you rent from Avis
and when you rent from one of the low-cost competitors," Deutsch said
of his company. "One might be location. We'll be in prime airport
locations everywhere there are prime airport locations.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a big emphasis on customer service--and we have a very
big emphasis on the quality and maintenance of our vehicles."</TE>
<TE>   Said Hertz's Broome: "We try to offer excellent service, make it
quick for the customer; the cars are new and you can count on them,
typically, to be clean. We pride ourselves on giving very good
service."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Thrifty's Payne acknowledged, "we're not putting your name
up in lights. We don't have a lot of bells and whistles that maybe
some of the other top-tier companies offer. But our customers aren't
those willing to pay for those either."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to the Web, customers know what they can get for what they
are willing to pay.</TE>
<TE>   "As customers look for deals and who has the best packages,"
Deutsch said, "they should be conscious not only of going to the
Expedias and Travelocities and Trip.coms of the world, but our best
pricing is on Avis.com. In general, those rental car sites should be
part of the picture when customers are planning to travel."</TE>
<TE>   "The Internet," Payne said, "has really leveled the playing
field."</TE>
<TE>   Which is how we found that, 10 days after our original price check
on that five-day weekday rental at the Denver airport, prices had
dropped (same period, same rules) at all companies. Thrifty, which
had been $202, was down to $162.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of those things that fluctuates continually," Payne
said.</TE>
<TE>   And these days in the rental car industry, flux is the name of the
game.</TE>

<HD>In San Francisco, Tired Travelers Take a Break</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At San Francisco International Airport, every phone in every terminal
can be hooked up to the Internet via laptop computers, and
yet-to-be-released products on the cutting edge of technology can be
viewed and tested in a jazzy new showcase room. But it is a break
from business that business travelers seem to enjoy most.</LD>
<LD>   "Good food, some music, a restful timeout in one of our quiet
rooms--that's what is popular right now," said Jane Sullivan, the
airport's marketing manager. "Business travelers still want access to
everything they need for work, but they don't want to feel like
that's how they have to spend every minute while they're here."</LD>
<LD>   A miniature movie theater called Altitunes in the international
terminal, for example, lets passengers watch first-run movies in
cushy chairs for free. Around the corner at InMotion Pictures in the
United Airlines terminal, they can rent movies and personal players
for their trip. Sales there are up 10% this year--an encouraging
sign, considering that the number of passengers remains down 11% from
last year.</LD>
<TE>   "Concession sales have improved dramatically," Sullivan said. "But
it was not looking so great there for a while."</TE>
<TE>   The airport's international terminal, which opened in December
2000, was designed largely to pamper business travelers with its
high-tech amenities and upscale restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   But as the economy soured and business travel dropped off, several
restaurants closed and retailers fell behind in rent payments. Total
concession sales last year declined 2%, with food and beverage sales
falling about 7% from 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Sales now are rebounding, and many airport businesses hope to be
back on track by year's end. Business travelers, they say, are
beginning to spend again--and not just on sushi and high-end golf
products.</TE>
<TE>   At the Hairport, a salon in the international terminal, weary
business travelers are snapping up $20 shoulder and scalp massages.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Piasanti, a networking engineer from Austin, Texas, who
recently had a two-hour layover in San Francisco, said he went to the
salon intending to spend $11 for a shower and shave. Instead, he paid
about $60 before he emerged, rested, rubbed and polished.</TE>
<TE>   Other quiet spots include an aquarium and nine art galleries, as
well as the reflection rooms, which have a well-enforced ban on cell
phones, pagers and electronics.</TE>
<TE>   "I should head over there next," Piasanti said. "The way I feel,
it seems like the right thing to do."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Johnny Damon scored the tiebreaking run on a wild pitch in the 15th
inning, and the Boston Red Sox defeated the Baltimore Orioles, 5-4,
Monday night to complete a four-game sweep at Baltimore.</LD>
<LD>   The victory kept the Red Sox alive in the American League
wild-card race. One more Boston loss or an Angel victory will
eliminate the Red Sox from playoff contention.</LD>
<LD>   With two out in the 15th, Damon reached on a walk by Willis
Roberts (5-4). Damon took third when Roberts threw wildly to first on
a pickoff attempt, and scored the unearned run when Roberts threw a
high fastball with a 1-1 count on Shea Hillenbrand.</LD>
<TE>   The Red Sox blew one-run leads in the ninth and 14th innings.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Gibbons hit two solo homers for the Orioles and Jeff Conine
homered in the 14th, but Baltimore lost its sixth in a row and has
lost 26 of 30.</TE>
<TE>   Boston took a 4-3 lead in the 14th when pinch-runner Rickey
Henderson scored on a single by Tony Clark after an error by Conine
at first. But Conine made amends by leading off the bottom half with
a home run on the first pitch from Alan Embree (1-2).</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Gomes earned his first save.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 3, New York 2--Aubrey Huff had the eighth and last hit
off Orlando Hernandez, an RBI single that broke a fifth-inning tie
and led the Devil Rays over the Yankees at New York.</TE>
<TE>   New York (98-58) missed an opportunity to move into a tie with
Oakland (99-57) for the league's best record.</TE>

<HD>Angels Shift Radio Stations</HD>

<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Disney-owned ABC Radio announced two major moves Monday that will
give one of its stations, KSPN, a big boost in the battle for
supremacy among Los Angeles sports-talk radio stations.</LD>
<LD>   KSPN next season will replace KLAC (570) as flagship station of
the Angels as part of a five-year deal worth an estimated $25
million.</LD>
<LD>   Also, effective Jan. 1, KSPN will switch signals with sister
station KDIS, Radio Disney, going from 1110 on the dial to 710.</LD>
<TE>   Radio Disney will go to from 710 to 1110.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Kontz, the director of sales at L.A.'s four ABC Radio
stations--KABC, KSPN, KDIS and KLOS--said that by switching to
50,000-watt 710, KSPN has the potential to reach an additional 2.5
million listeners, including those in Palm Springs, the San Joaquin
Valley and San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Ashlock, the station manager at KLAC, said: "We tried very
hard to find a way to continue our relationship. The one thing that
we just couldn't get past was the number of times the Angels were
bumped from KLAC by Laker broadcasts."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this season, with the Lakers making a run to their third
consecutive NBA title, Angel broadcasts were bumped off KLAC 27
times.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are returning to a familiar frequency. The Gene
Autry-owned KMPC (710) carried the Angels for 36 years.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel, which owns KLAC and KXTA (1150), now has lost
rights to both of Southern California's major league teams.</TE>
<TE>   A few months ago it was announced that the Dodgers will move from
KXTA to Infinity's KFWB (980) next season.</TE>

<HD>Appier Can Thank the Mets and Vaughn</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>Kevin Appier might be the most fortunate player in the major leagues
this year.</LD>
<LD>   If the New York Mets had not been so desperate for offense last
winter, they might not have gambled on first baseman Mo Vaughn, who
missed the 2001 season because of injury.</LD>
<LD>   But they did, and they traded Appier to the Angels for Vaughn.</LD>
<TE>   Appier starts tonight for the Angels, pitching with a chance to
clinch the team's first playoff berth in 16 years. Had he stayed in
New York, he would have been part of a Met summer that included
co-owners filing dueling lawsuits, the star catcher compelled to call
a news conference to discuss his heterosexuality, a pitcher compelled
to apologize for marijuana use at another news conference--not to
mention a last-place standing on a $100-million payroll.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been ugly," Appier said. "Kansas City has the
excuse--we have to build our team, we can't afford to purchase a good
team every year. In New York, there aren't a lot of excuses."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rookie reliever Scot Shields has thrown a no-hitter, sort of.
Shields has not given up a hit over his last 11 2/3 innings and has
lowered his earned-run average to 1.96, second to closer Troy
Percival on the team.</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand, Shields has kept a no-hitter intact for three
weeks; he has not given up a hit since Sept. 3.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, even though his streak extends beyond nine
innings, Shields isn't about to accept congratulations for pitching a
no-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   "No, no, no, no," he said. "That's not even close to somebody
throwing one in a nine-inning game, where hitters face you three or
four times.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't imagine facing guys three or four times and not giving
up any hits."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Francisco Rodriguez pitched in his first major league game six
days ago, but he could pitch himself into the Angels' record book in
his next outing. Rodriguez has struck out seven consecutive batters,
one shy of the franchise record set by Nolan Ryan.</TE>

<LD>Baseball umpires angry with the computer system used to track their
calls behind the plate filed unfair labor practice charges against
owners Monday with the National Labor Relations Board.</LD>
<LD>   In a 21-page letter sent to the NLRB's regional office in New
York, the World Umpires Assn. accused management of violating the
labor law by refusing to provide information about the computer
system, which umpires claim is inaccurate.</LD>
<LD>   "The office of the commissioner has shielded the Questec system
from inspection, and from critical inspection by experts trained in
the physics of baseball and engineering," union lawyer Joel Smith
wrote to Celeste Mattina, the NLRB's New York regional director.</LD>
<TE>   The next step is for the NLRB office to decide whether to issue a
complaint. If it does, the matter would go before an administrative
law judge.</TE>

<LD>Detroit Tiger fans said farewell to Ernie Harwell, who called his
final home game Sunday after 42 seasons with the club and 55 seasons
as a major league announcer.</LD>
<LD>   An announced crowd of 23,930 in Detroit cheered Harwell and
chanted, "Ernie! Ernie! Ernie!" during the seventh-inning stretch.
After the game, Tiger officials dug up home plate and presented it to
Harwell.</LD>
<LD>   The team also announced it was naming the press box at Comerica
Park, "The Ernie Harwell Media Center."</LD>
<TE>   Harwell was touched, and appreciative, but wondered what the fuss
was all about.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm overwhelmed by all of the attention," he said. "I always
looked at myself as just a worker and it's hard for me to comprehend
all of the attention."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: The Boston Red Sox and the Seattle Mariners are about
to become the second and third American League teams to win 90 games
and fail to advance to the playoffs since the current wild-card
format was adopted in 1995. Name the first team. Hint: It's not the

Ranger shortstop Alex Rodriguez: "A-Rod has MVP numbers this year,
Hall of Fame numbers, but all the homers and RBIs are parlor tricks,
cute diversions to be forgotten immediately once real baseball begins
in October.</TE>
<TE>   "A-Rod should be the P-rod, the plutonium rod that fuels the
reactor core with his marvelous baseball skills.</TE>
<TE>   "But, the power plant with which Rodriguez is affiliated has too
many Homer Simpsons. So instead, A-Rod is an L-rod, a lightning rod
for abuse from those who see him as a symbol of baseball's wretched
excess."</TE>
<TE>   More A-Rod: "To me, the MVP is the guy who had the best year,"
Seattle Manager Lou Piniella said. "His numbers are just better. If
the numbers are close, then I'd vote for the guy who plays for the
best team. I think the media makes too much of the fact of a guy on a
winning team."</TE>
<TE>   Gone fishin': With the Red Sox out of playoff contention, Pedro
Martinez said he's content to call it a season after winning his 20th
game Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm done," he said. "Right now, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done. I
haven't had a vacation in two years. Unless we're in it, I'm not
making my next start. I'm not going to take a chance of getting hurt
on the last outing."</TE>
<TE>   For what it's worth: Seattle outfielder Ichiro Suzuki became the
seventh player in major league history to record at least 200 hits in
his first two seasons. Only two, Lloyd Waner (1927-29) and Johnny
Pesky (1942-44), had 200 hits in each of their first three seasons in
the big leagues.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The Cleveland Indians in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Mitch Albom of the Detroit Free Press likes the
Detroit Lions' new downtown stadium. He's not crazy about the
sad-sack Lions.</TE>
<TE>   "When the first touchdown at Ford Field was scored on a reverse
punt return, the crowd went wild," Albom wrote after Sunday's loss to
the Green Bay Packers. "The home team had a lead! Football was being
played in downtown Detroit!</TE>
<TE>   "And then, reality set in. It wasn't football, it was the Lions.
You can take the team out of the ugly but you can't take the ugly out
of the team."</TE>

<HD>Clippers Decide to Retain Olowokandi, for Now</HD>
<DH>Basketball: Instead of locking up center with a long-term
deal, team risks his becoming unrestricted free agent by signing him
for one year, $6.1 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers checked off one more item on their off-season to-do list
Monday, with center Michael Olowokandi signing the team's one-year
qualifying offer worth $6.1 million. Olowokandi will become an
unrestricted free agent July 1, eligible to sign with the highest
bidder, and that includes a possible new deal with the Clippers.</LD>
<LD>   The next order of business for the Clippers is to sign power
forward Elton Brand to a long-term extension before the NBA's
deadline Oct. 31. The Clippers open the season Oct. 30 against the
Cleveland Cavaliers at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Brand is under contract for the 2002-03 season and could agree
next summer to accept a one-season qualifying offer, such as the one
Olowokandi took, in order to remain with the Clippers through
2003-04.</LD>
<TE>   Training camp begins next Tuesday at Palm Desert, but one
potential problem was avoided with the signing of Olowokandi.</TE>
<TE>   Almost two weeks ago, Bill Duffy, Olowokandi's agent, set a Sept.
18 deadline for the team to sign his client to a deal worth more than
the $80 million given during the off-season to Sacramento King point
guard Mike Bibby. The Clippers were offering a seven-year contract
worth $8.5 million a season.</TE>
<TE>   The deadline came and went, with Duffy refusing to comment on
their next move. Olowokandi, 27, on Monday agreed to take the
Clippers' one-season offer, which comes with a 30% pay raise over his
2001-02 salary. Olowokandi, the No. 1 overall pick in the 1998 NBA
draft, had career bests of 11.1 points and 8.9 rebounds last season.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to getting to work," Olowokandi said. "We
have a very good team and I'm excited to get the season underway."</TE>
<TE>   Through Duffy, he refused further comment.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect that Michael will work hard to continue to improve and
that he will be prepared to make a big contribution to our team's
success this year," Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Baylor also declined further comment.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's been the Clippers' determination that they don't
feel he is a 'max' player as of yet," Duffy said, referring to the
team's unwillingness to give Olowokandi a so-called "max-out"
contract of $100 million over seven seasons. "We'll see about that
next summer if he continues to improve. He'll certainly have other
options. He also has no problem continuing with the Clippers."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Olowokandi could put negotiations he described two weeks
ago as "personal" behind him, Duffy said, "Michael is prepared for
any challenges. He feels he has a lot to prove. He wants to go to the
next level as one of the premier big guys in basketball. He's excited
for the season to start. The Clippers are going to have a great team.
We feel like he'll be the centerpiece."</TE>

<LD>A consumer's guide to the best and worst of sports media and
merchandise. Ground rules: If it can be read, heard, observed,
viewed, dialed or downloaded, it's in play here. One exception: No
products will be endorsed.</LD>
<LD>   What: GQ magazine, The Sports Issue</LD>
<LD>   Price: $3</LD>
<TE>   New England Patriot quarterback Tom Brady, along with Minnesota
Timberwolve Kevin Garnett grace the cover of the sports issue of GQ,
which went on sale this week.</TE>
<TE>   The men's fashion magazine doesn't disappoint with profiles of NHL
scoring leader Jarome Iginla of the Calgary Flames, the Mannings;
Archie, Eli and Peyton "football's first family" and Sheik Mohammed
bin Rashid al-Maktoum of Dubai, one of the richest men in the world,
and his bid to buy the Kentucky Derby with his prized thoroughbreds.</TE>
<TE>   There is a lighthearted spread of some of the best-dressed
athletes and the first woman who taught tthem about style--their mom.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine also looks at 11 of the all-time worst trades.</TE>
<TE>   For many Dodger fans the 1993 trade of pitcher Pedro Martinez to
the Montreal Expos for Delino DeShields may be at the top of their
list but GQ ranked it No. 5.</TE>
<TE>   GQ's worst is the 1971 trade of Nolan Ryan for Jim Fregosi. The
New York Mets sent Ryan, Don Rose, Leroy Stanton and Francisco
Estrada to the Angels for Fregosi. Ryan won 295 of his 324 career
victories after the trade. Fregosi eventually was sold to the Texas
Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   For Laker fans trading Vlade Divac to Charlotte for the draft
rights to Kobe Bryant in 1996 was a genius move by then-General
Manager Jerry West. It came in at No. 2.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Less Rest for a Testy Tracy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dodger Manager Jim Tracy has a big smile for every visitor to his
office, remembers the name of every reporter who asks him a question,
and is quick to laugh at every joke, good or bad, he is told.</LD>
<LD>   Ever the family man, he spent Monday, the start of the final week
of the regular season, helping Brian, the oldest of his three sons,
move to Santa Barbara to start college.</LD>
<LD>   Yet not even the most amiable of men is immune to the pressures of
a playoff chase. And last week, the tension surfaced.</LD>
<TE>   When a reporter wrote that the Dodgers looked flat, Tracy snapped,
"You weren't in this dugout."</TE>
<TE>   When another reporter inquired about Dodger relief pitching, Tracy
replied sharply, "You know what's going on in that bullpen."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy says he doesn't sleep as much as he did, down from around
eight hours a night to five. Instead, he sits in front of the
television and channel surfs.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't eat as much, either, sometimes only one meal a day.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't feel hungry," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But don't get the feeling Tracy is miserable.</TE>
<TE>   "I may sleep less but fatigue doesn't enter into it," he said of
his first pennant race. "I'm anxious to go to work. This is fun."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the jokes don't seem as funny when the Dodgers lose.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center fielder Dave Roberts, sidelined because a strained muscle
in his right side that may prevent him from returning this week, will
have an MRI exam today.... Heading into Monday's games, Roberts was
tied for the major league lead in stolen bases with Luis Castillo of
the Florida Marlins, each with 45. The last Dodger to lead the league
in that category was Davey Lopes with 63 in 1976.</TE>

<TE>   (10-3, 2.91 ERA)</TE>
<TE>   Update--Tracy is down to two reliable pitchers in these final,
furious days, Hideo Nomo and Perez. Perez is 5-2 with a 2.57 ERA in
his last 10 starts. And he has held opposing teams to two earned runs
or fewer in 18 of his last 31 starts. Perez has been especially
consistent against Colorado this season, going 3-0 with a 2.48 ERA
and two complete games in four starts. The Dodgers have won six of
seven against the Rockies at Dodger Stadium.</TE>

<HD>Goalies Are Pared to Three</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The goalie situation was clarified when team officials trimmed the
roster from 48 to 34 players Monday.</LD>
<LD>   J.F. Damphousse was one of 14 players sent to minor league
Cincinnati's training camp, which leaves Martin Gerber as the Ducks'
probable No. 2 goalie. Gerber and Ilja Bryzgalov are the only goalies
left as possible backups to Jean-Sebastien Giguere.</LD>
<LD>   Gerber is expected to win that competition, although Duck
officials see more potential in the 21-year old Bryzgalov.</LD>
<TE>   He probably will go to Cincinnati, where he will play every day.</TE>
<TE>   "If I stay in Anaheim, I'll play 10 games," said Bryzgalov, a
second-round pick in 2000. "I need to play 70 games this season to
get experience. I'm young. I have time."</TE>
<TE>   Gerber, on the other hand, isn't so young at 28. An eighth-round
pick in 2001, he is playing his first season in North America after
having played in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 28, so the Ducks don't have time to build me up," Gerber
said. "I don't have as much time, so I need to do it now."</TE>
<TE>   Damphousse, who was acquired in a trade with New Jersey, played
only the third period against the Kings on Sunday, stopping two of
three shots.</TE>
<TE>   "We watched him [in camp] and we think where he's going is where
he should be," Coach Mike Babcock said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Joffrey Lupul, the Ducks' No. 1 draft pick in June, participated
in contract drills the last two days. Lupul missed the first part of
camp while recovering from a hairline fracture in a lower vertebra.</TE>
<TE>   His chances of making the team are slim but he may play in this
weekend's exhibition games.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll have to earn a spot in the lineup," Babcock said.</TE>

<HD>Colorado's Ochs to Sit Out Season</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Colorado quarterback Craig Ochs has decided not to play again this
season after suffering his third concussion in the last year.</LD>
<LD>   Ochs hasn't played since he was hurt against San Diego State on
Sept. 7. Extensive medical tests came back normal but Ochs told Coach
Gary Barnett on Monday that he won't play the rest of the season for
the Buffaloes (2-2).</LD>
<LD>   Ochs, a junior who has started since his freshman year, will apply
for a medical waiver redshirt for this season. He also will withdraw
as a student from Colorado and relinquish his athletic scholarship.</LD>
<TE>   In a statement, Ochs said he will reevaluate his options for
returning to play football next season.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very surprised," Barnett said. "We totally respect his
decision and it was a family decision all the way. He wants to pull
himself out and see if he can get himself healthy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Tech junior tailback Tony Hollings, a converted safety
leading the nation in rushing, is out for the season because of a
torn knee ligament. Hollings rushed for 633 yards and 11 touchdowns
in four games, but tests Monday confirmed the damage.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior Ahmaad Galloway, Alabama's leading rusher the last two
seasons, will miss the rest of his senior year because of a knee
injury. The injury ends Galloway's college career because he has used
his redshirt year.... South Carolina State running back Derek Watson
was suspended by Coach Buddy Pough, a day after his arrest for
reckless driving. Pough did not want to discuss whether Watson would
take part in practices or team activities during the suspension,
according to spokesman Bill Hamilton.... Kentucky gave Coach Guy
Morriss a contract guaranteed through 2007, rewarding him for the
team's first 4-0 start in 18 years.</TE>

<HD>Hartman Is Key to Galaxy Hopes</HD>

<LD>There's an old soccer saying that as a team's goalkeeper goes, so
goes the team.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 1-seeded and Western Conference champion Galaxy, behind
the strong, stingy play of goalkeeper Kevin Hartman, has subscribed
to that theory as it prepares to begin the Major League Soccer
playoffs Wednesday against the Kansas City Wizards.</LD>
<LD>   "I think our whole defense has been playing well the past few
weeks and Kevin, with his shot-blocking ability, has been a very
important element down the line," Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid said.</LD>
<TE>   "He's certainly a player who has the ability to make big saves in
big games."</TE>
<TE>   Hartman has given up only one goal in his last four games and the
Galaxy, which at one time was 11 points behind San Jose, caught the
Earthquakes and passed them in the final two weeks, to win its fifth
division title in seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Hartman had consecutive shutouts against the high-scoring
Earthquakes to end the regular season and nine saves in the Galaxy's
1-0 victory at San Jose on Saturday, once blocking a penalty kick.</TE>
<TE>   "As goalkeepers, there's not really too much action we see on a
consistent basis," Hartman said. "So a lot of the pressure is
psychological pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Which allows for a quick sense of accomplishment after a clutch
block, as he had on Ronnie Ekelund's penalty kick.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a small pause of relief there," Hartman said. "But then
you have to make sure the ball is cleared out of there so it all
happens so fast."</TE>
<TE>   Hartman began the 2002 season holding the league's all-time best
goals-against average, 1.12. But the former UCLA standout also began
the season on the bench behind fellow former Bruin Matt Reis.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, many thought Schmid was resorting to hyperbole when
he compared his club's fortunes of boasting two exceptional
goalkeepers to what the U.S. national team had on its roster for the
World Cup in Brad Friedel and Kasey Keller, both of whom start in the
English Premier League.</TE>
<TE>   Especially when Schmid replaced Reis on the heels of a three-game
losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   But since then, Reis has flourished in a back-up role and given up
only one goal in three U.S. Open Cup games.</TE>
<TE>   Hartman, meanwhile, has shown flashes of his 1999 self, when he
had 11 shutouts, set a still-standing single-season record with a
0.91 GAA and was named MLS goalkeeper of the year.</TE>
<TE>   It would seem that Hartman, 28, is fully recovered from surgeries
on his knee and wrist that slowed him the previous two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   In 18 games this season, Hartman has a record of 11-6-1 with five
shutouts and his 1.09 GAA is tied with Jon Busch of the Columbus Crew
for the league lead.</TE>
<TE>   "He's fought hard the past two years and I'm sure it's been
frustrating for him," Schmid said. "But goalkeepers always get better
with age and he's finding his form."</TE>

<HD>Belanger Seeking Big Role</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eric Belanger, who spent his first two NHL seasons as a third- or
fourth-line center, is battling for more playing time and,
presumably, more points with the Kings this season.</LD>
<LD>   He strengthened his bid Sunday night, scoring the winning goal in
a 3-2 exhibition victory over the Mighty Ducks.</LD>
<LD>   "I want to have a more important role," Belanger said afterward.
"I'm not saying that [the role I played] last year wasn't important,
but I've got a little more experience and I just want to do a little
bit more on the ice."</LD>
<TE>   Belanger, 24, was enjoying a productive second season before
suffering a wrist injury Jan. 15 that required surgery and sidelined
him for 29 games.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Andy Murray has said repeatedly that, at the time he was
injured, Belanger was the Kings' best player.</TE>
<TE>   Belanger, who had 22 points in 46 games before the injury, finally
returned to the lineup for the last seven games of the regular season
and the playoffs, but he never regained his earlier form,
contributing only two assists.</TE>
<TE>   After a long summer, however, he said he's ready to move up.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I've showed since the beginning of training camp that
I've got skills to play an offensive role," he said. "I'm expecting I
could be on the second line with [Bryan Smolinski] on the wing, or
with me on the wing [and Smolinski at center]."</TE>
<TE>   It's a possibility, Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   "In past years, he made our team as a third- or fourth-line
checker, competing hard physically and taking the body," he said. "If
he can continue to do that and can add a little more offense, his ice
time will go up.</TE>
<TE>   "We need some guys to step up and give us what we call secondary
scoring, and he's a guy that's challenging for one of those jobs."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings were given the day off Monday. Their exhibition game
against the Colorado Avalanche on Wednesday night at Denver is the
first of four in five nights.... Nine King prospects were assigned to
the minors and two were reassigned to their junior teams, reducing
the roster to 42 players.</TE>

<TE>   U.S. Coach Van Chancellor said the American women were motivated
by the sixth-place finish of the U.S. men's team at the World
Championships earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's ever been anything that's been any better
attention-getter for the U.S. women than the fact our men got beat,"
Chancellor said. "I think that's one of the reasons we've been so
focused."</TE>

<HD>Smith Gets the Call From Bengals Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Akili Smith is back as the Cincinnati Bengals' starting quarterback.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Dick LeBeau, whose team has scored 16 points in an 0-3
start, said the third overall pick in the 1998 draft will start
against Tampa Bay on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Smith, the Bengal starter in 2000, had been languishing as the
third-stringer.</LD>
<TE>   He has the ability to scramble for yardage if his receivers are
covered, an element that the Bengals' other two quarterbacks--Gus
Frerotte and Jon Kitna--lack.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little bit shocked," Smith said of his reaction when
LeBeau told him of the promotion. "Thank God for the opportunity.
That's all I've ever wanted, was the opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "My season begins now. I'm not even thinking about being 0-3."</TE>
<TE>   LeBeau said he is making no promises beyond Sunday as he tries to
right his team. He said Kitna will be the No. 2 quarterback and
Frerotte will be demoted from No. 1 to No. 3 to rest his right thumb,
injured earlier this season.</TE>
<TE>   LeBeau said he also expects to announce other lineup changes on
Wednesday, including promoting Levi Jones, the No. 1 draft pick, at
left tackle ahead of veteran Richmond Webb.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Cory Raymer had surgery on his ruptured left Achilles'
tendon and will be out for the season, the first major injury
suffered by the unbeaten San Diego Chargers this year.</TE>
<TE>   Raymer was hurt in the first quarter of Sunday's 23-15 win at
Arizona. Rookie Jason Ball, an undrafted free agent out of New
Hampshire, replaced Raymer and will start Sunday when the Chargers
play host to New England in a matchup of 3-0 teams.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Staring guard Dave Fiore probably is out for the rest of the San
Francisco 49ers' season after tearing a ligament in his right knee.</TE>
<TE>   Starting linebacker Jamie Winborn will miss five to eight weeks
because of a knee injury. Both players were hurt during the 49ers'
20-10 victory over Washington on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Green Bay defensive end Vonnie Holliday will miss six to eight
weeks because of a torn chest muscle and starting safety Antuan
Edwards is out for three to four weeks because of a broken arm.</TE>
<TE>   Holliday was hurt Sunday during the Packers' 37-31 win at Detroit.
Coach Mike Sherman said fifth-round pick Aaron Kampman will take
Holliday's place. Matt Bowen or Marques Anderson will replace Edwards</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Houston Texans, allowed to begin the season with three extra
players under NFL expansion rules, cut their roster to the league
norm of 53 players.</TE>
<TE>   The Texans waived offensive lineman Chad Overhauser, free safety
Kevin Williams and linebacker Troy Evans.</TE>
<TE>   The team also cut fullback Ed Stansbury from the practice squad.</TE>

<HD>Separated Shoulder Will Sideline Gonzalez</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Arizona Diamondbacks may have lost a lot more than a chance to
clinch a playoff berth.</LD>
<LD>   Luis Gonzalez, who leads the team in home runs and runs batted in,
separated his left shoulder in an outfield collision as the
Diamondbacks lost, 13-1, to the St. Louis Cardinals on Monday night
at St. Louis.</LD>
<LD>   The star left fielder was going back to Phoenix today to meet with
Michael Lee, the team physician.</LD>
<TE>   "Best-case scenario, it'll be a first-degree separation and it'll
be maybe a week," Diamondback trainer Paul Lessard said. "Worst-case
scenario would be the season."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez is batting .288 with 28 home runs and 103 RBIs. He got
the hit that won last year's World Series for the Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez was hurt when he tried to make a diving catch on Tino
Martinez's bloop double in the fourth inning. Shortstop Tony Womack's
knee hit Gonzalez's shoulder, and Womack cartwheeled over his
teammate.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't look good right now for him being a part of our
postseason plans," pitcher Rick Helling said. "Hopefully it's not as
bad as they think it is."</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals broke open the game by scoring 10 runs in the
seventh inning, and sent Arizona to its fourth consecutive loss. The
National League West leaders have a magic number of one for wrapping
up a playoff berth, with six games left.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it's a lot more than just a loss in the standings,"
Manager Bob Brenly said.</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks' lead for home-field advantage in the first round
of the playoffs is down to two games over St. Louis, which has won 16
of 19. The NL Central champion Cardinals had their highest-scoring
game this season in the opener of a three-game series.</TE>
<TE>   "You guys can create the drama," Manager Tony La Russa said.
"We'll just come out and play the game tomorrow and try and find a
way to win."</TE>
<TE>   Eli Marrero had four hits for the second time in four games. St.
Louis tied a season high with 18 hits.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston 8, Milwaukee 6--Jeff Bagwell hit a two-run single and
Brandon Puffer (3-3) pitched one scoreless inning to earn the victory
as the Astros defeated the Brewers at Houston.</TE>

<HD>Greco Back With UCLA</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Senior guard Michelle Greco was cleared by the UCLA medical staff to
resume her college basketball career, school officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Her 2001-02 season ended after five games because of her history
of concussions. Greco averaged 23.6 points in those games, in which
the Bruins were 3-2. UCLA was 6-18 without her.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm just very excited and can't wait to play," said Greco, who
has been granted a fifth year of eligibility by the Pacific 10. "It's
been so long since I could actually play with my team. I had
anticipated getting cleared during summer. Everyone was playing
together and it was tough standing there watching. But it was still
worth the wait."</LD>
<TE>   Greco said she has no restrictions, but plans to be more aware of
her style of play. "I do at times drive [to the basket] with my head
down, which I've done since high school," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Coach Kathy Olivier, "She is not a kid you can limit, but I
hope Michelle has learned a different approach to the game from being
out for a year. On the sidelines you see the game with different
eyes. We know she can score, but I think she understands her
teammates better and can make her own game better."</TE>

<HD>Strange Puts Spin on Tiger's Remarks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SUTTON COLDFIELD, England</DL>
<LD>The signs posted at every turn at the Belfry read "2001," but that
doesn't mean the time's not right for the Ryder Cup. And perhaps
another sign of the times was the number of armed officers patrolling
the site, three days before the opening ceremony and four days before
the matches actually begin.</LD>
<LD>   Postponed a year ago because of security concerns after the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks--it has been three years since the Ryder Cup
last was played--the 34th edition began picking up speed Monday,
propelled along by just the right fuel.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, a small amount of controversy.</LD>
<TE>   Curtis Strange, the U.S. captain, spent some of his time putting
the appropriate spin on comments Tiger Woods made last week, saying
the Ryder Cup's social schedule is too demanding and takes him out of
his routine.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, of course, is correct. He might have said it last week
while he was busy winning the American Express Championships in
Ireland but was also saying the same thing at his first Ryder Cup at
Valderrama in Spain in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   No big deal, Strange said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been handled," he said. "He's a team player. We had dinner
[Sunday] night and we discussed some of those things.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole week takes you out of your normal routine for any
player, not just Tiger Woods ... it's a long week.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, there's social functions we have to attend, which is fun,
but when you come here, you're going to be part of a team."</TE>
<TE>   Woods, who prefers T-shirts and blue jeans, will instead don a
tuxedo and attend a black tie gala scheduled to end at 11:30
Wednesday night with practice rounds at 9 a.m. Thursday and then the
opening ceremony at 3 p.m. The first four-ball matches begin at 8
a.m. Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Strange also tried to take some of the steam out of another of
Woods' comments last week, when Woods said he would rather win the
tournament in Ireland than the Ryder Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Strange blamed the media.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it was an unfair question, because they're different
animals--stroke-play, individual tournament; match play, team event,
teammates," he said. "It's really an unfair question and when you try
to answer it honestly, I think you get into trouble. I think we both
know when Tiger Woods plays, he's ready to play, so he's the least of
my concern."</TE>
<TE>   Sam Torrance, captain of the European team, says that Woods
answered the way he did because he endorses American Express, which
sponsors the $5-million tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Torrance also said he could not think of a single European who
would say he'd rather win the tournament before the Ryder Cup instead
of the Ryder Cup itself.</TE>
<TE>   Said Torrance: "Tiger said he'd rather win the million last week
than play this week? I think we'd probably chip in and pay him a
million this week."</TE>

<HD>Trial and Error Won't Work for Raiders Either</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now first of all I don't see any problem with a juror detesting team
owner Al Davis and deciding from Day 1 of a trial that the Raiders
are evil and no longer own any claim to the Los Angeles market. The
guy obviously knew his football.</LD>
<LD>   And besides, what kind of country is this if you can't hate the
Raiders?</LD>
<LD>   In fact I find it ludicrous the Raiders would insist on a fair
trial in Los Angeles, given their history of shenanigans and missteps
here.</LD>
<TE>   But now we're being told rooting for the Jets is juror misconduct,
and although I agree rooting for the Jets is a big mistake,
apparently it's just as bad to take notes on butcher paper, because
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Richard C. Hubbell ruled Monday it's
enough to win a new trial for the Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   Now I've bumped into Judge Hubbell a couple of times at the
Bel-Air Country Club, and although we've never played golf together,
I worry now that if I took him in a $2 Nassau, six months down the
road he'd hit me with a technicality and demand a do-over. I'm sure
he's just interested in justice, and I'm going to remember that when
it comes to getting strokes from him if we ever play together.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SOME PEOPLE are going to jump to the conclusion this thrusts the
Raiders back into the Los Angeles market, giving them a say on the
future of professional football here once again. It probably means
politician Nate Holden will return to making noise, but nothing else
has changed: The Raiders will play no role in the return of football
to the Los Angeles market.</TE>
<TE>   First of all, there are no plans to bring an NFL team to L.A., so
no plans for the Raiders to disrupt or to put on hold. Second, the
NFL ignored the Raiders and their ridiculous claims the last time
around, and although the judge apparently has his own idea of instant
replay, the NFL is aware it still won the first trial.</TE>
<TE>   Now for those who forgot, the NFL awarded an expansion franchise
to Los Angeles in 1999, ignoring Davis' claim he owned the market,
and had Michael Ovitz &amp; Co. produced a check in the neighborhood of
$700 million, the Los Angeles Stars would have already played three
games.</TE>
<TE>   Had Davis won his $1.2-billion conspiracy claim against the NFL in
the spring of 2001, he would have been a rich man after all the
appeals, but a rich man still sentenced to hard time in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   A victory in L.A. will not free his team from its lease
obligations in Oakland, so any talk about the Raiders returning to
L.A. is wishful thinking on the part of hoodlums looking for
something to do on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders will tell you no team will move here as long as Davis
claims he owns the L.A. market, which won't be the last blast of hot
air we get from Oakland. If a new stadium is made available to the
Colts or Chargers, they'll be here before nightfall.</TE>
<TE>   My only concern now that we're headed to a new trial is finding 12
jurors in the Los Angeles area who are not Jet fans or fond of
posting notes on butcher paper. I don't think there's any way to keep
Raider haters off the jury, however, if the judge is going to insist
on having 12 people sitting in judgment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I PLAYED golf Monday with the best referee to officiate an NFL
game, in the NFL alumni tournament to benefit the Boy Scouts at Los
Coyotes Country Club, and I commended Jim Tunney on the outstanding
job he did in his final game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure you played a big part in helping the Buffalo Bills
defeat the Raiders, 51-3, in that playoff game" in 1991, I said. "Any
chance you might be available for jury duty in the coming months?"</TE>

<TE>   HOW DO you think Vince Lombardi would have reacted if Terrell
Owens or Keyshawn Johnson yelled at him along the sidelines?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO ONE really cares about the Angels most of the time, but now
that they're going to be in the playoffs, everyone around here is
going to act as if they are really interested.</TE>
<TE>   I look at it as good practice, of course, because when the Grocery
Store Bagger marries the daughter, we're probably going to find
ourselves spending time with the Bagger's parents and faking as if we
really like them too.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago Laker flags appeared on almost every car, and I'm
wondering how this sudden fascination with the Angels will manifest
itself. The color red will be in, of course, and I'd imagine local
schools will declare the first playoff game here "Red Day," which is
a far cry from those days when we were youngsters crawling under our
desks in fear of the Reds nuking us.</TE>
<TE>   The bigger the Angels get, the more we're going to see and hear
from Rex Hudler, and if you don't know what I'm talking about,
imagine wearing headphones 24 hours a day with Richard Simmons in one
ear and Regis &amp; Kelly in the other.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Scioscia, of course, is going to get the hero's treatment,
and it will be nice to see the Dodgers represented in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   I also have the feeling the Rally Monkey is about to become a TV
star with his own series if the Angels go anywhere in the playoffs.
In fact, the Choking Dogs, who will probably be home watching the
Angels in the playoffs like the rest of us, might want to take note
of the Angels' success and think about introducing the Rally Mutt at
next year's games.</TE>

<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from James:</TE>

gets.' Is that true?"</TE>
<TE>   Obviously she didn't want my name linked to her in the story.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Europe's leading soccer coaches confirmed Monday what Galaxy Coach
Sigi Schmid has known all season: that one striker is enough.</LD>
<LD>   Schmid and the Galaxy rode the talents and the league-high 24
goals of Guatemalan striker Carlos Ruiz to the best record in Major
League Soccer and the top seeding in the MLS playoffs that begin
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, at the start of a three-day summit of Europe's 52
national team coaches in Warsaw, former Scotland coach Andy Roxburgh,
now UEFA's technical director, said teams that play a fluid system
behind a solitary front-runner often are proving the most successful.</LD>
<TE>   "One of the key trends coming out of the World Cup is more teams
playing with one striker," Roxburgh was quoted as saying by Reuters.
"No team gives up space for free nowadays, so you need players to
rotate in front."</TE>
<TE>   Roxburgh said Brazil won the World Cup largely because of the
ability of players such as Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho to
interchange positions on the fly.</TE>
<TE>   "When they played with two strikers, one was slightly behind the
other," he said. "When they played with three front-liners, they were
always rotating, always moving. That is the most difficult thing to
mark [defend against] and the greatest advantage of this system."</TE>
<TE>   France to Host Cup</TE>
<TE>   The Executive Committee of FIFA, world soccer's governing body,
announced that France will play host to the 2003 FIFA Confederations
Cup from June 18-29 at Paris, Lyon and Saint-Etienne.</TE>
<TE>   Australia, South Africa and the United States also had bid to
stage the eight-nation event, which features the champions of FIFA's
six continental confederations as well as the world champion and one
invited team.</TE>
<TE>   The 2003 Confederations Cup field will consist of Brazil (world
champion), Cameroon (Africa), Colombia (South America), France
(Europe), Japan (Asia), New Zealand (Oceania), the U.S. (CONCACAF),
as well as an invited team yet to be named.</TE>
<TE>   MLS Attendance Again Rises</TE>
<TE>   Attendance at MLS games grew for the second consecutive season, to
an average of 15,822 a game during the just-concluded 2002 regular
season, according to league figures.</TE>
<TE>   That represented a 6% rise over 2001 and a cumulative 15% jump in
the last two seasons. The average is the highest since the league's
inaugural season in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   The Colorado Rapids led the league with 20,690 fans per game,
followed by the Galaxy with 19,047 and the New York/New Jersey
MetroStars with 18,155.</TE>
<TE>   Wortmann Takes Charge</TE>
<TE>   Ivo Wortmann, former coach of the defunct Miami Fusion of MLS, was
hired as coach of Botafogo in the Brazilian league after the
resignation of Abel Braga, who became the 13th coach to either quit
or be fired since the start of the Brazilian season Aug. 11.</TE>
<TE>   See, We Told You</TE>
<TE>   Failing to learn from the ridicule heaped upon Welsh rugby
referees, who earlier signed a sponsorship agreement with a leading
British optician, Scottish soccer referees Monday agreed to be
sponsored by the same firm, Specsavers.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the $1.17-million agreement, the company's name
will be worn on referees' shirts. There was no immediate word on
whether the placards handed to Welsh rugby fans that read "Get your
blinking eyes tested, ref," will also be available to Scottish soccer
fans.</TE>

<LD>By the time Steve Klosterman finishes his college recruiting trips,
he'll probably qualify to be a restaurant critic, considering how
much steak, lobster and prime rib he'll be eating over the next
month.</LD>
<LD>   Klosterman, a 6-foot-7 volleyball player at Huntington Beach
Marina High, is the No. 1 high school prospect in the nation, which
means he's going to encounter an elaborate wooing process.</LD>
<LD>   On each college trip, schools will feed him until he's stuffed.
They'll escort him on a private tour of the campus, maybe put his
name in lights on the arena scoreboard and try to treat him to such a
unique experience that he'll want to sign a letter of intent Nov. 13.</LD>
<TE>   UCLA, USC, Pepperdine, Hawaii, UC Irvine and Long Beach State are
the schools taking their best shots.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't know where I'm going," Klosterman said.</TE>
<TE>   He does have some ideas what he's looking for, such as what the
school has to offer academically and how well the players get along
as a team.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably most important is how the coach treats players,"
Klosterman said. "Is he a personable guy you can go up and talk to?"</TE>
<TE>   Klosterman will soon learn that every coach is personable during
the recruiting process. That's what makes a final decision so
difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, some athletes end the suspense by committing early. It
eases the stress and helps keep their waistlines in check.</TE>
<TE>   USC baseball Coach Mike Gillespie should be celebrating because he
has finished his recruiting, thanks to early commitments from pitcher
Ian Kennedy and third baseman Ian Stewart of Westminster La Quinta,
pitcher Jo-Jo Reyes of Riverside Poly, shortstop Hector Estrella of
Covina Northview and outfielder Daniel Perales of Santa Ana Mater
Dei.</TE>
<TE>   But some of those baseball recruits might not make it to USC.
Several could be high draft choices in June and offered lucrative
signing bonuses to pass up college.</TE>
<TE>   "This is high-risk stuff," Gillespie said.</TE>
<TE>   From last year's recruiting class, Gillespie signed shortstop
Sergio Santos from Mater Dei, but he never made it on campus after
signing with the Arizona Diamondbacks as a first-round draft choice.</TE>
<TE>   High school seniors in every sport except football, boys' and
girls' soccer and boys' water polo can sign Nov. 13.</TE>
<TE>   There are plenty of elite athletes in Southern California still
trying to figure out their college choices.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County is the place to visit in girls' water polo, because
that's where six of the nation's top prospects live.</TE>
<TE>   "It's by far the best and deepest class yet," UCLA Coach Adam
Krikorian said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the players facing tough college decisions are Emily Feher,
Brittany Hayes and Gaby Domanic of Santa Ana Foothill, Erika Figge
and Aimee Stachowski of Santa Margarita and Meredith McColl of
Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Water polo coaches have been offering women's scholarships since
1994.</TE>
<TE>   In softball, infielder Jodie Legaspi of Garden Grove Pacifica is
the object of an intense recruiting competition between collegiate
powers UCLA and Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   In girls' basketball, Noelle Quinn of Torrance Bishop Montgomery
is considered one of the top guards in the nation. She's also an
All-American in volleyball. Stanford is considered the leader among
the many schools trying to sign her.</TE>
<TE>   In boys' basketball, Sean Phaler, a 6-9 forward from Villa Park,
has his sights on Indiana, UCLA, Washington and Oregon. D.J.
Strawberry, a 6-5 forward from Mater Dei, has committed to defending
NCAA champion Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   In boys' water polo, 6-7 1/2 Trevor Clark of Anaheim Servite, a
member of the U.S. junior national team, will be taking recruiting
trips to USC, UCLA and California. He has family ties to USC, so the
Trojans are the team to beat.</TE>
<TE>   The Southland's three top boys' golfers--Kevin Larsen of Santa
Barbara San Marcos, Henry Liaw of Hacienda Heights Los Altos and Josh
Wooding of Riverside Poly--are visiting a number of schools.</TE>
<TE>   In baseball, one of the top uncommitted pitchers is left-hander
David Huff of Huntington Beach Edison. He visited Long Beach State
last weekend and has a trip scheduled to Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes it helps to have family connections. Brian Schroeder,
the son of former UCLA and Washington Redskin quarterback Jay
Schroeder, was a heavily recruited left-handed pitcher at El Cajon
Christian High.</TE>
<TE>   "We kind of let him pick and choose," Jay said. "He had some great
choices."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Brian settled on the Bruins, which made his parents,
both UCLA graduates, feel good.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been [to UCLA] once or twice," Jay said.</TE>

<HD>Sunderland Gets One-Year Laker Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Sunderland and the Lakers have agreed in principle on a deal
that will make him the second play-by-play announcer the NBA team has
had since it moved to Los Angeles from Minneapolis in 1960.</LD>
<LD>   "Paul and the Lakers are satisfied with the terms that have been
worked out," Sunderland's agent, Martin Mandel of San Francisco, said
Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   Mandel said he expected the contract to be signed today or
Wednesday, with an announcement after that.</LD>
<TE>   Sunderland will replace the legendary Chick Hearn, who died Aug.
5. Hearn began announcing Laker games during the playoffs in 1961, at
the end of the team's first season in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Mandel declined to give terms of the agreement, and Sunderland and
Laker officials would not comment.</TE>
<TE>   But sources said it is a one-year contract in the $300,000 range.</TE>
<TE>   "I will say that compared to what other NBA announcers make, it is
a fair-market deal," Mandel said.</TE>
<TE>   The one-year term was a sticking point in negotiations, sources
said. The offer was made Friday and an agreement wasn't reached until
late Monday.</TE>
<TE>   It is believed the Lakers insisted on a one-year contract because
they want to see how the local telecasts on Channel 9 and Fox Sports
Net fare against ESPN telecasts this season before making a lengthy
commitment.</TE>
<TE>   Under the NBA's new national television contract with ABC, ESPN
and Turner, local telecasts no longer will be protected by blackouts.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps another reason for a short-term contract is that the
Lakers want to reevaluate Sunderland after he has a full season under
his belt. Sunderland called 56 games last season when Hearn was
sidelined by heart surgery and then hip surgery, and his work was
generally well-received.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers will continue to simulcast games on television and
radio with Sunderland and Stu Lantz, at least for one more season.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' first exhibition game is Oct. 8, when they play the
Clippers at Bakersfield. That game will be televised by Channel 9 and
broadcast on flagship radio station KLAC (570).</TE>

<HD>Deep Discussion About Offense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The short and long of the Bruin passing game was discussed at length
by Coach Bob Toledo and quarterback Cory Paus on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The game plan in the loss to Colorado on Saturday differed
drastically from that of a week earlier, when Paus burned the
Oklahoma State secondary for eight completions of more than 20 yards
in a 38-24 victory.</LD>
<LD>   Paus did not throw deep against Colorado until late in the third
quarter, preferring to throw short and let receivers run with the
ball. But the same Buffalo defenders who'd missed tackles a week
earlier in a loss to USC hauled down Bruin receivers.</LD>
<TE>   "We wanted to convert high-percentage passes and let our guys
run," Toledo said. "But we didn't make any big plays. They did tackle
better. We didn't catch and run as well as we'd hoped."</TE>
<TE>   Paus was accurate, completing 21 of 35 passes. But a week after
he'd racked up 277 yards on 13 completions, his passes went for only
189 yards, an average of nine yards per completion.</TE>
<TE>   His career average is 15.6 yards per completion, a testament to
his ability to complete the long ball.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple balls could have been completed deep but either the
receiver got cut off or I had to scramble," he said. "I was taking
what the defense was giving me. I did what I was coached to do and
ran the offense."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As anticipated, 6-foot-3 sophomore Matt Ware will move from free
safety to cornerback and match up against 6-5 receiver Kassim Osgood
of San Diego State.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Ben Emanuel will move from strong safety to free safety,
and freshman Jarrad Page will play strong safety, making his first
start. Jibril Raymo also is expected to play strong safety. Demoted
is senior cornerback Joe Hunter, who figures to play quite a bit
anyway because the Bruins are expected to frequently employ a nickel
defense to combat the potent Aztec passing game.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Adam Hall has posted the nation's top passing efforts
the last two weeks, throwing for 516 yards against Arizona State and
506 against Idaho. Osgood averages 9.75 catches and 143 yards
receiving per game, and J.R. Tolver leads the nation with 11 catches
and 179.3 yards a game.</TE>
<TE>   "The corners didn't play poorly [against Colorado]," Bruin
defensive coordinator Phil Snow said. "It's just a completely
different challenge this week."</TE>
<TE>   Ware, a freshman All-American at cornerback last season, doesn't
view the change as permanent. He has 16 tackles and one interception
this season. "Corner comes second nature," he said. "I'll play
wherever the coaches want me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toledo attributes his weight loss of more than 20 pounds to
working out on a treadmill, taking lunchtime walks around campus with
assistant John Pierce and cutting down on carbohydrates.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The game Saturday will be broadcast on KSPN (1110) because of a
conflict with the Dodgers' game against the San Diego Padres. The
Dodgers will be broadcast on KXTA (1150).... The Bruin game at Oregon
State on Oct. 5 will begin at 12:30 p.m. and will be shown on Channel
7.</TE>

<HD>Malone Is Eager to Bounce Back</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC punter Tom Malone was happy to get back on the practice field
Monday after suffering through a long weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Malone, a freshman, averaged 36.9 yards on 11 punts in USC's 27-20
loss to Kansas State on Saturday. Three short kicks went out of
bounds and a 12-yard punt in the third quarter set up a 29-yard,
three-play scoring drive by Kansas State that gave the Wildcats' a
13-point lead.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought about it a lot," Malone said. "I was real disappointed.
I felt I let the team down.</LD>
<TE>   "The wind, and the way it affected my drop, just got a little in
my mind. I was trying to do too many things and I was just kicking it
bad."</TE>
<TE>   Malone struggled again at the outset of practice. He shanked a
kick during a drill and was ordered off the field by special teams
coach Kennedy Pola.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a bad kick and that's not how I should have responded
after what happened--I should have come out and killed it," said
Malone, who is averaging 40.9 yards on 18 punts this season.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Huff, a transfer from Michigan, took a few kicks until
Malone returned and finished by kicking several long, high spirals.</TE>
<TE>   "[The break] gave me a chance to think about things," Malone said.
"I came back and kicked well.</TE>
<TE>   "The next few days will be real big for me, and a lot of it will
be trying to get things straightened out. I'm not too worried about
it. I think I can kick through it."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Pete Carroll apparently agrees. Asked if Malone was
competing for the position, Carroll said, "Tommy Malone is punting
for us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Starting left cornerback Ronald Nunn underwent an MRI exam on his
right knee and said he is bracing for bad news when he learns the
results today.</TE>
<TE>   Nunn, a junior transfer from City College of San Francisco, was
injured covering a receiver away from the ball against Kansas State.
He said doctors told him he might have a torn anterior cruciate
ligament or a severe sprain.</TE>
<TE>   "[Sunday] when I came in and got treatment, there wasn't any
swelling," Nunn said. "Unfortunately, when I got home it got a little
puffy on me."</TE>
<TE>   If Nunn tore the ligament, he would probably undergo surgery and
become a redshirt. Nunn became a starter after senior Kevin Arbet
broke a foot and was forced to use a redshirt season.</TE>
<TE>   William Buchanon, a redshirt freshman, replaced Nunn against
Kansas State and could start in his place Saturday against Oregon
State. Carroll said freshman Justin Wyatt and junior Marcell Allmond
also are competing for the spot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tight end Alex Holmes caught his first pass this season against
Kansas State and is hoping to parlay that reception into more
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Holmes was regarded as the frontrunner to start after catching 22
passes for 166 yards and two touchdowns last season. But Gregg
Guenther moved ahead of him during training camp and caught three
passes against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "I absolutely, 100% have not been playing to my capability--that's
the bottom line," Holmes said. "My expectations were to have a huge
year, a breakout season. It just hasn't started that way."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Walk-on receiver Greig Carlson played for the first time against
Kansas State, returning three punts for 23 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of overwhelming at first, but it was fun as soon as I
got the first one," said Carlson, a redshirt freshman from Palisades
High. "I was told to stay ready. I'm hoping to get more chances and
hopefully break one."</TE>

<HD>Men Behind Embassy Bomb Plot Are Jailed in Chile</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SANTIAGO, Chile</DL>
<LD>A Chilean judge sent two men to jail Monday for nearly 11 years for
mailing a letter bomb to the U.S. Embassy in Santiago after the Sept.
11 attacks in a bid to create business for their security firm,
judicial sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The explosive device was addressed to the U.S. ambassador and
delivered to the embassy in late September 2001 in the mail. It was
defused and no damage was done.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers said Judge Jorge Zepeda found Lenin Guardia and former
government informer Humberto Lopez guilty of "terrorist conduct" and
sentenced them to 10 years and 300 days in prison.</LD>
<TE>   Guardia, a freelance intelligence advisor, employed Lopez, a
former leftist guerrilla-turned-government informer.</TE>
<TE>   Guardia has denied any connection to the letter bomb, but Lopez
confessed months ago that it was Guardia who had planned the failed
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez's lawyer said the pair sent the bomb to try to create panic
in Chile after the Sept. 11 attacks and increase demand for private
intelligence services.</TE>
<TE>   Discovery of the device led officials and the media to speculate
that a group linked to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network
might be active in Chile. Police arrested Guardia and Lopez soon
after.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Children in Ivory Coast Cross-Fire</HD>
<DH>Africa: Gunfire erupts around boarding-school refuge of 100
American youths and other foreigners. None is hurt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast</DL>
<LD>Heavy gunfire erupted Monday night at a school in Bouake where about
100 American children were taking refuge from a bloody military
uprising in Ivory Coast, the school director said. French troops
moved into the rebel-held central city and stood ready to evacuate
foreigners if needed.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S.-based director of a boarding school housing the young
Americans--children of missionaries from across Africa--said rebels
breached the walls of the school itself and fired briefly but
furiously across the campus.</LD>
<LD>   "It really was cross fire. Not shooting at the children, but a
whole lot of ammo going and scaring the children to death," said
James Forlines, director of Free Will Baptist Missions, who spoke
from Nashville, Tenn., where he made hourly contact with the school.
None of the kids was hurt.</LD>
<TE>   Ranging from infants to 12-year-olds, the young Americans are
among 200 foreigners holed up at the boarding school for children of
missionaries in Bouake, a besieged city that has been in rebel hands
since they launched a coup attempt four days ago. The uprising killed
at least 270 people in its first days.</TE>
<TE>   Residents said the shooting was brief, and rebel forces denied
radio reports that the town in central Ivory Coast had been retaken
by loyalist troops.</TE>
<TE>   French troops with trucks and helicopters set up camp Monday at an
airport outside the capital, Yamoussoukro, just 40 miles from Bouake.</TE>
<TE>   Their mission: to ensure the safety of the French citizens and
other Western nationals and, if necessary, to get them out. There are
about 20,000 French nationals in the Ivory Coast.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Embassy said Sunday it had no immediate evacuation plans
for its nationals.</TE>
<TE>   A half-dozen African leaders planned to meet Thursday in Morocco
for a regional summit aimed at trying to restore peace. Ivory Coast
President Laurent Gbagbo is among those invited, according to a
statement issued by the presidential office of Gabon, the organizer.</TE>

<HD>Sept. 11 Changing NATO's Scope</HD>
<DH>Defense: Alliance shifts focus to terrorism and arms
control, moving beyond member regions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WARSAW</DL>
<LD>Its core mission altered by the Sept. 11 attacks, NATO is refocusing
itself on combating terrorists and controlling weapons of mass
destruction, U.S. officials said Monday, tasks that might put the
alliance in position for a role in an American-led war on Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The organization's new focus is one of the reasons Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld is expected to propose to the alliance
today that it create a rapid-response force of as many as 20,000
soldiers. The force would be capable of striking on 30 days' notice
well outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's traditional
areas of North America and Europe.</LD>
<LD>   "NATO has been transformed in its thinking about its role, its
structure, its mission because of what happened on Sept. 11, 2001,"
said a senior NATO official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   Rumsfeld also is discussing the proposal in private talks with
member states. If NATO ministers back it, the issue would come up for
a vote at a November NATO summit in Prague, the Czech capital.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a broad recognition now in the alliance--but there was
not on Sept. 10, 2001--that the combination of terrorism and weapons
of mass destruction is the single greatest threat, not just to the
United States but to every member of the alliance," the senior NATO
official said Monday. "And we assume the great majority of threats in
the future to NATO countries will not come from within Europe but
from outside Europe. Therefore we need the proposal, the capability
that Secretary Rumsfeld will be proposing tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld met with Poland's president, prime minister and defense
minister Monday and is expected to meet with NATO Secretary-General
George Robertson and Turkish and Italian defense officials before
returning to Washington on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   NATO's proposed new mission would create an organization capable
of taking on the type of threats that President Bush says are posed
by Iraq. Asked about NATO's potential involvement in a war on Iraq,
Rumsfeld told reporters traveling with him to Warsaw on Sunday, "It
hasn't crossed my mind. We've not proposed it."</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. policymakers said they would seek support from NATO
members in the event of a war, either formally or through
contributions from NATO members acting outside the organization.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever we decide to do, whatever the international community
decides to do, I think we would welcome the support, the political
support of our friends and allies in NATO," said a senior U.S.
defense official. "I think that's something we're here to talk
about."</TE>
<TE>   One problem with including NATO in a war on Iraq or the Bush
administration's pursuit of terrorists is that it would change the
organization's mission of defending its member nations in their own
region.</TE>
<TE>   Although NATO as an organization is not involved in Afghanistan,
18 of its 19 members have played a role. The only nation not
participating, Iceland, joined NATO for its protective military
umbrella because Iceland has no military.</TE>
<TE>   NATO is not formally coordinating the international military
mission in Afghanistan partly because of member countries' concerns
that the operation went beyond alliance rules and territory.</TE>
<TE>   Those limits would end under proposals that would extend the pact
outside its traditional area of operations, revamp its command
structure and reorient it to focus on terrorism and taboo weapons.</TE>
<TE>   American strategists are pressing for a new, streamlined NATO
structure that would transform the alliance from an organization
designed to battle a Soviet invasion of Europe to one capable of
crossing the globe to rescue hostages or fighting wars in remote
regions, said the U.S. defense official.</TE>
<TE>   Such changes would mirror Rumsfeld's ongoing transformation of
Pentagon military programs, which is focused on high-tech warfare and
designed to get soldiers to battle more quickly and with better
coordination.</TE>
<TE>   "Threats have changed, and now it's necessary to look at how the
command structure needs to change to continue to make sure that it is
agile, that it can deploy, that it can support the kinds of
operations that are more likely in the 21st century--particularly,
that it can do so in a timely way," the defense official said.</TE>
<TE>   NATO leaders are planning to consider ways to enhance their
capabilities for precision bombing, communications, chemical and
biological weapons defenses and transportation of soldiers and
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson has urged European nations to contribute more and
coordinate their purchases of military equipment to provide for a
more balanced arsenal for the organization as a whole. France,
Britain and Norway have each agreed to spend more.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The United States has stopped tens of millions of dollars in aid to
Ukraine, suspicious that the former Soviet republic may have sold a
military system to Iraq that could help bring down American planes, a
senior U.S. official said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Allegations have swirled for months about a military transfer, but
this is the first time the U.S. government acknowledged any belief

<HD>Legislators' Opposition to Iraq Attack Withers</HD>
<DH>Congress: Lawmakers limit their resistance to trying to
narrow the focus of Bush's far-reaching draft resolution on Hussein.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK and ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Congressional opposition to authorizing a potential military attack
on Iraq is crumbling, but leading lawmakers are making a last-ditch
effort to narrow the focus of a White House-requested resolution that
would grant the administration wide latitude in dealing with Baghdad.</LD>
<LD>   White House officials and congressional leaders are meeting to
discuss possible changes to temper the far-reaching powers President
Bush asked for in a draft resolution sent to Congress last week.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the Bush administration turned up the public heat on
the international community on the eve of introducing a formal
resolution at the United Nations to force Iraq to surrender its
weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<TE>   Bush, during a trip to New Jersey, warned the United Nations that
it risks being seen as "nothing but a debating society" if it does
not pass a tough resolution on dismantling Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to see strong resolutions coming out of that U.N., a
resolution which says the old ways of deceit are gone, a resolution
which will hold this man to account, a resolution which will allow
freedom-loving countries to disarm Saddam Hussein before he threatens
his neighborhood, before he threatens freedom, before he threatens
America and before he threatens civilization," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said Monday that they were encouraged by what they
were hearing behind the scenes among the other 14 members of the U.N.
Security Council. And U.N. officials said there were growing
indications that Russia would agree to a new U.N. resolution
targeting Iraq, despite its having expressed reservations about the
need for further mandates.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not come out against a resolution tightening the regime
of [the] work of the inspectors in Iraq," Russian Defense Minister
Sergei B. Ivanov said during a stopover Monday in Lisbon.</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, only a small cadre of lawmakers--mostly liberal
Democrats--has come out in direct opposition to authorizing force
against Iraq. Even Democrats who just two weeks ago were raising
caution flags and demanding answers to questions about Bush's goals
now seem resigned to Congress voting soon to support his policies
toward Iraq. The key remaining question seems to be the margin by
which the resolution passes.</TE>
<TE>   However, many lawmakers are still trying to change the wording of
Bush's proposal. Of particular concern is language that seems to
authorize military action not just in Iraq but across the region.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a large number of people--in both parties--who think that
that is a very broad mandate to give to the president," House
Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Democrats have been most vocal about their misgivings,
even some Republicans are quietly expressing concerns that the
administration is overreaching.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the White House wish list," said a senior House
Republican advisor. "Our members are going to want to make sure there
is a role for Congress."</TE>
<TE>   This aide predicted that the White House would accept changes in
the phrasing that would authorize the use of force to achieve, among
other things, "peace and security in the region." Many lawmakers want
that language revised to specify Iraq as the target.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Monday that the
language was borrowed from earlier U.N. resolutions that should be
acceptable to lawmakers. But Fleischer signaled that the
administration would be flexible on that point: "If the Congress
decides that the boilerplate diplomatic language that's been
contained in previous United Nations resolutions is not appropriate,
we'll work with them on it." Many Democrats concede that they have
little leverage to make major changes in the resolution, such as a
bigger role for the U.N. in the confrontation with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to get whatever he wants," said a senior House
Democratic strategist. "He's going to do whatever he wants."</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats may try to draft an alternative resolution. But
others worry that would project a message of division at a time when
Congress should be standing united behind the president.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a difference of opinion as to whether there should be an
alternative," Pelosi said.</TE>
<TE>   Congress also has begun to turn its attention to the cost of
launching an attack on Iraq. An analysis by the Democratic staff of
the House Budget Committee released Monday concluded that an initial
military operation lasting 30 to 60 days with a U.S. force ranging
from 125,000 to 250,000 would cost between $48 billion and $93
billion.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials continued to charge that Hussein has backtracked on
the commitment he made Sept. 16 to allow U.N. arms inspection teams
into his country for the first time in four years.</TE>
<TE>   Since Thursday, Baghdad has warned that it will not allow
inspectors to engage in searches that would compromise Iraqi
"sovereignty and dignity," a reference to several presidential
compounds that Hussein has tried to keep off-limits.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Monday that Iraq had not
formally notified him that the sites would be kept from inspection.
But he reiterated his message to Baghdad that the terms of the
inspectors' return are not negotiable.</TE>
<TE>   "Recent Iraqi statements are just further proof that Iraq is
already backtracking on its commitments to have inspections without
conditions," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In Britain, which is co-sponsoring the U.N. resolution, Prime
Minister Tony Blair told his Cabinet on Monday that Hussein is
manufacturing new weapons of mass destruction, despite formal denials
from Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no doubt that Saddam is continuing with his WMD program.
We are not talking about historic leftovers, but an ongoing
continuing program. [Hussein] has been able to make progress in his
WMD program and has to be stopped," Blair said, according to a
government spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Blair brought with him an intelligence dossier on Iraq's weapons
programs, at least a part of which will be made public today.</TE>

<HD>Trucking Firm Cleared in Fatal Crash</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Westlake Village trucking firm will no longer face a charge of
manslaughter in connection with a February 2000 crash that killed one
of its drivers.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors moved to dismiss the charge Monday after further
investigation revealed that driver error was most likely the cause of
the accident, not poor maintenance by defendant R.P. Cummings Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Patrick Hildebrand, 41, of Ventura died when he lost control of a
company tanker truck on a steep grade near Santa Paula and crashed
into a creek ravine.</LD>
<TE>   An investigation by the California Highway Patrol concluded that
the foot brakes failed because of poor maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the CHP report, the district attorney charged the company
with involuntary manslaughter and a state Fish and Game code
violation for a 7,000-gallon crude-oil spill that fouled the creek.
But as they neared trial, prosecutors received new evidence that
prompted them to reevaluate the case.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, a consultant hired by the defense concluded that
information captured in the truck's electronic control module, which
recorded information in the last 90 seconds before the crash,
suggested that the condition of the brakes did not cause the
accident.</TE>
<TE>   The data showed that the truck went into neutral seconds before
the crash, rendering the brake system inoperable, according to the
prosecution motion to dismiss the case.</TE>
<TE>   The defense consultant noted in an Aug. 24 report that Hildebrand
had the truck in the wrong gear and rode the foot brakes down the
grade, causing them to overheat. "Mr. Hildebrand was reportedly an
experienced driver," the consultant wrote. "Yet the manner in which
he drove down the grade on the day of the accident is perplexing."</TE>
<TE>   New evidence also revealed that Hildebrand had been experiencing
problems with his left arm before the accident and could use only one
hand when driving his truck. A medical report dated less than a week
before the accident shows that Hildebrand was instructed not to drive
a company vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Douglas Ridley presented the motion in court
Monday morning and Superior Court Judge Edward Brodie dismissed the
manslaughter charge. Through its attorney, R.P. Cummings pleaded no
contest to the Fish and Game code violation and sentencing was set
for Nov. 15.</TE>

<LD>   Prosecutors moved to dismiss the charge Monday after further

suggested that the condition of the brakes did not cause the
accident.</TE>
<TE>   The data showed that the truck went into neutral seconds before

prosecution motion to dismiss the case. The defense consultant noted
in an Aug. 24 report that Hildebrand had the truck in the wrong gear

"Mr. Hildebrand was reportedly an experienced driver," the consultant

<TE>   New evidence also revealed that Hildebrand had been experiencing
problems with his left arm before the accident and could use only one

<TE>   "The defense expert concluded that Hildebrand's medical condition
could have contributed to the problems he had controlling the truck
directly before the accident," Deputy Dist. Atty. Douglas Ridley
wrote in the dismissal motion.</TE>
<TE>   "The people did not have this new evidence at the time this case
was filed or argued at preliminary hearing, nor were the people aware
that the truck even recorded this data until the defense brought it
to our attention," Ridley said.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the CHP did not seize the so-called "black box" from
the truck during its investigation. It was discovered by the defense
after the truck was released by the law enforcement agency.</TE>
<TE>   A follow-up investigation by an expert retained by the district
attorney reached similar conclusions and, according to the motion,
"raised serious questions about defendant's guilt."</TE>
<TE>   Ridley presented the motion in court Monday morning and Superior
Court Judge Edward Brodie dismissed the manslaughter charge. Through
its attorney, R.P. Cummings pleaded no contest to the Fish and Game
code violation and sentencing was set for Nov. 15. The trucking
company faces up to $250,000 in fines, attorneys said.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, attorney Robert McCord, who represents the
company, said both sides worked together to find the truth and reach
a fair compromise.</TE>
<TE>   McCord said the company has suffered "devastating" financial
losses. In addition to the anticipated fees from the criminal case,
R.P. Cummings is being sued in civil court by Hildebrand's relatives.</TE>

<HD>County Seeks Way to Unclog Sewers</HD>
<DH>Infrastructure: Oils, fats are the No.1 cause of overflows.
Supervisors to be asked to fund study.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To help reduce sewer backups that pollute the ocean, county staff is
seeking $90,000 from the Board of Supervisors for a study on
attacking fats and oils that clog sewer pipes.</LD>
<LD>   Grease and fats are the No. 1 cause of sewer overflows in Orange
County, and sanitation experts have yet to find a solution that
prevents drain stoppages.</LD>
<LD>   "We're looking at grease interceptors and we have all kinds of
technology, including chemicals that can be added into the sewer
line," said Lisa Murphy, a spokeswoman for the Orange County
Sanitation District. "But not all chemicals are good for the sewer
system. They harm both the pipe and the treatment plant."</LD>
<TE>   Under the proposal, the sanitation district and the county would
each put up $90,000 for the study; cities are expected to pay the
remainder of the $500,000 cost. Supervisors are expected to approve
the funds Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The study will help the county determine how to comply with new
state restrictions aimed at cutting the number of spills in central
and northern Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The county and cities are also now required to meet tough federal
Clean Water Act regulations. They must comply within a year of
receiving updated National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
permits, issued every five years. Those that don't can face daily
fines of up to $1,000, as well as $10 per gallon for sewage spills.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach recently instituted a "zero tolerance" toward spills.
The city was ranked as second-worst among 30 California cities graded
for sewage spills in 2001. It is spending $1.6 million--including
$870,000 from a federal Environmental Protection Agency grant--to fix
more than three dozen sewer deficiencies. The fats-and-oils study
will examine new technologies and how governments across the country
are preventing clogged drains. The study will be completed by June
2003.</TE>
<TE>   According to the state Water Resources Control Board, which
enforces the Clean Water Act, backed-up sewers are a growing problem.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen in our investigations that sewage spills are a major
contributor to beach closures and [that] grease blockages are a major
cause of sewer overflows," said Kurt Berchtold, assistant executive
officer of the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board.</TE>

<HD>County Orders Reports on Illness</HD>
<DH>Health: Starting next month, doctors must add invasive
pneumococcal disease to the list of ailments they track. Officials
hope to assess resistance to antibiotics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County will begin next month requiring doctors and
hospitals to report all cases of invasive pneumococcal disease--an
aggressive bacterial illness--to public health officials so they can
track the level of antibiotic resistance.</LD>
<LD>   "We have been using and abusing antibiotics for so many years
that, in many cities and states, we have been seeing resistance of
this organism to routine antibiotics," said Dr. Laurene Mascola,
chief of acute communicable disease control for the county Department
of Health Services.</LD>
<LD>   Already, almost a quarter of cases are resistant to penicillin,
which has caused doctors to stop using the medication as an initial
preferred treatment.</LD>
<TE>   Officials are worried that the sometimes fatal disease, which
causes meningitis and blood infections, will develop resistance to
other medications, limiting options for treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, several health groups launched a campaign to educate
the public about the dangers of taking antibiotics for colds and flu,
which are caused by a virus.</TE>
<TE>   At many local pharmacies, a free brochure in 10 languages will be
distributed to customers as they pick up their prescriptions.</TE>
<TE>   Invasive pneumococcal disease will be added to a list of more than
80 conditions--including AIDS, measles and anthrax--that must be
reported to the county by health-care providers.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County health officials also say that they want to
study the effect of a childhood vaccine, called Prevnar, which
protects against many infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae
bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   These illnesses include invasive pneumococcal disease, and ear and
sinus infections.</TE>
<TE>   For seven years, Los Angeles County has been asking some labs and
infection-control doctors to voluntarily report cases of invasive
pneumococcal disease. The number of reported cases dropped 21% in
2001, to 603.</TE>
<TE>   The decrease was greatest among children younger than 5 who had
access to the Prevnar vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   Until mandatory reporting begins, officials say they will not know
for sure whether their data are representative of the county at
large.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to get a little more teeth into reporting," said Dr.
Elizabeth Bancroft, a medical epidemiologist with the county.</TE>

<HD>Southland Sizzles, With Record High of 110 Posted in the
Valley</HD>
<DH>Weather: Previous record for date was 105 in Chatsworth, in
1978. Mercury is expected to be high again today.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Temperatures soared to record levels in the San Fernando and Simi
valleys Monday, with a top reading of 110 degrees at Chatsworth.
Forecasters say it will be just about as hot today.</LD>
<LD>   Monday's high in Chatsworth broke the record for the date there of
105, set in 1978. It was 108 Monday in Simi Valley, 4 degrees above
the record for the date, set in 1978, and it was 108 at Pierce
College, one degree above the record there, set in 1949.</LD>
<LD>   Other readings Monday included 108 at the Pomona Fairplex, 107 in
Northridge and Van Nuys, 103 in Burbank, 102 in Monrovia and 101 in
Pasadena and Thousand Oaks.</LD>
<TE>   It was significantly cooler closer to the coast.</TE>
<TE>   Readings of 91 were taken in downtown Los Angeles, 81 in Venice
and 72 at the pier in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   The National Weather Service said the hot valley weather is the
result of a ridge of high pressure that is blocking the onshore flow
of cool, moist air from the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Forecasters said this ridge will weaken this afternoon, but only
slightly, and temperatures in the valleys will remain above 100
through Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The onshore flow should start returning Thursday, but high
temperatures are expected to reach the 90s in the valleys through the
weekend.</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana Group Settles Funds Dispute</HD>
<DH>Education: State of California and a local nonprofit will
pay the federal government more than $3 million over alleged class
funding irregularities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Department of Education and a Santa Ana nonprofit
group have agreed to pay the federal government more than $3 million
to settle one of several legal disputes over funding of English
classes for immigrants.</LD>
<LD>   The amount is a fraction of the estimated $15 million that federal
officials say is unaccounted for from a 1990s statewide adult
education program. Federal officials say some of the money supposedly
was spent on classes that never took place.</LD>
<LD>   The state education agency, which administered the federally
funded project, said late last week it agreed to pay the U.S.
Department of Education $2.5 million. The department was sued in 1997
for allegedly overlooking questionable accounting practices by
several community organizations that were paid to conduct English as
a Second Language and citizenship classes for adult immigrants. The
state agency admitted no wrongdoing.</LD>
<TE>   In a separate settlement, Citizens in Action Community
Development, a Santa Ana nonprofit organization, agreed to pay nearly
$640,000 to the federal government, the group's attorney said Monday.
Federal prosecutors say they traced illegally obtained grant proceeds
to Citizens in Action, which received assets from another nonprofit
group, Los Angeles-based Hermandad Mexicana Nacional Legal Center.</TE>
<TE>   The legal center was among 10 community organizations accused in
1998 of misusing federal education grants. Federal prosecutors
accused Hermandad of spending money on real estate, among other
improper purposes. The state education department ceased funding the
groups that year and has since been trying to recover the money.</TE>
<TE>   Nativo Lopez Ex-Officer</TE>
<TE>   Citizens in Action, founded in 1998, lists among some of its
former officers Nativo Lopez, the beleaguered Santa Ana Unified
School District trustee and the former No. 2 official at Hermandad
Mexicana Nacional.</TE>
<TE>   According to the federal complaint, Lopez arranged in 1998 to
transfer a Santa Ana building belonging to Hermandad to Citizens in
Action.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the complaint said, Citizens in Action sold the
building for $1.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the sale, the U.S. attorney's office seized Citizens
in Action's bank account, worth more than $970,000.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors argued the money was "traceable to the grant monies
provided to [Hermandad Mexicana Nacional Legal Center] and wrongfully
diverted."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Rosen, an attorney representing Citizens in Action, said
Monday the group agreed last week to forfeit nearly $640,000 of the
seized money as part of a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez did not return a call seeking comment. William Parker, who,
according to Rosen, is president of Citizens in Action, also did not
return calls.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen said Citizens in Action offers technology training to low-
income families.</TE>
<TE>   For Lopez, who has always denied any wrongdoing, the controversy
has proved a political liability.</TE>
<TE>   Detractors, including those behind a campaign to recall him, point
to Lopez's former association with Hermandad Mexicana Nacional and
its alleged fund misappropriation as a sign that he can't be trusted.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, who severed his ties with Hermandad Mexicana Nacional since
the death of its leader Bert Corona early last year, heads a separate
group called Hermandad Mexicana Nacional of Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   The two groups had worked closely, including during the
federal-funded classes for immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Suit Filed Last Year</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the California Department of Education sued both
Hermandad groups and Lopez for $7 million, alleging they diverted the
adult education funds.</TE>
<TE>   That suit is scheduled for trial in March. Two other lawsuits
against other community-based organizations are pending.</TE>
<TE>   In the only criminal charges to stem from the disputes, a federal
grand jury indicted Hermandad Mexicana National Legal Center, the Los
Angeles group, in July 2001. Lopez was not named as a defendant.</TE>
<TE>   Since Corona's death, the Legal Center has existed only on paper,
with no one laying claim to the organization.</TE>
<TE>   That "makes it a little harder to prosecute," said Assistant U.S.
Atty. Lee Arian, in charge of the case. "But we can go after any
assets that can be traced to the legal center."</TE>

<HD>Suit Alleges Hazing in Death</HD>
<DH>Litigation: Family of Kristin High, one of two college
students who drowned, seeks $100 million from sorority.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The family of one of two Cal State Los Angeles students who drowned
this month filed a $100- million wrongful death lawsuit Monday
against Alpha Kappa Alpha, the sorority that Kristin High's family
blames for her death at Dockweiler State Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The suit in Los Angeles County Superior Court contends that High,
a 22-year-old senior at Cal State Los Angeles and mother of a
2-year-old boy, was led into heavy surf late at night on Sept. 9 by
sorority members. It contends that High, wearing sweatpants and
tennis shoes, was tied up and blindfolded and taken into the water in
what is believed to be a pledging ritual popular with black
fraternities and sororities on the West Coast. The ritual is supposed
to build trust between pledges and older members.</LD>
<LD>   Waves that night were cresting about 10 feet, Los Angeles police
said. When a swell pulled down High and 24-year-old senior Kenitha
Saafir, the women on the beach tried to rescue them. Officers called
to the scene pulled High and Saafir from the water and administered
CPR, but it was too late. The county coroner's office verified the
cause of death.</LD>
<TE>   Police said that the drownings were accidental and that although
hazing has not been ruled out, no evidence of wrongdoing--including
blindfolds or rope--was found at the scene or on the women.</TE>
<TE>   "There was some sorority-related activity; that's why they were at
the beach," LAPD Lt. Mike DePasquale said. "The actual drownings,
however, occurred after the activities were over.... Was there
hazing? Maybe. But we don't think so."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the family disagreed and accused the sorority of a
"code of silence".</TE>
<TE>   "It is now turning [into] what we believe is a cover-up," attorney
Mansfield Collins said. "Nobody is talking to us. We had no choice
but to file this lawsuit. This is a very courageous family. They
don't want their daughter to die in vain."</TE>
<TE>   Carl Douglas, the lawyer representing Saafir's widower, Karim
Saafir, said Monday that his client hopes to resolve his concerns
informally with the sorority's national representatives.</TE>
<TE>   The Cal State Los Angeles chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha is an
unofficial group not recognized by the campus or the sorority's
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Alpha Kappa Alpha, which is based in Chicago, is the oldest black
sorority in the nation and includes as members Maya Angelou, Toni
Morrison and Rosa Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Sorority officials in Chicago did not return calls seeking
comment. But in an earlier statement the organization promised to
cooperate with authorities.</TE>
<TE>   High's parents, Patricia Strong-Fargas and Samuel High, said they
were outraged by the silence of those present that night. Those
sorority members and pledges did not attend the women's funerals and
have not contacted the family, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know [these women]. They were in my home. I've fed them at my
table," Strong-Fargas said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not angry at them," she said. "I'm just disappointed. They're
hiding behind this code of silence, and they're victims too."</TE>
<TE>   High's parents said they want the national organization to own up
to what's happening at some campuses, albeit unofficially, in the
name of sisterhood.</TE>
<TE>   "They call it 'underground,' but they know, they know that this is
going on," Strong-Fargas said. "It's gone too far."</TE>
<TE>   The family is establishing an anti-hazing organization and a
scholarship fund for Skyler Arthurs, High's son.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's father, Holman Arthurs, who was High's fiance, said at a
news conference announcing the suit: "You can tell by my face, my
eyes and my voice that I am angry. This was the person I was supposed
to spend the rest of my life with."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities are searching for a man suspected of abducting his

Accord with California license plates HENDEN1.</LD>
<TE>   Floyd is described as a 5-foot-5 African American, with black hair
and brown eyes, weighing about 180 pounds. Richardson, 27, is a

<HD>City Officials Spend 6 Hours With Lopez</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn met with Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez on Monday,
the first of three candidates for LAPD chief to be interviewed by the
mayor</LD>
<LD>   In a parlor at Getty House, the mayor's ceremonial residence in
Hancock Park, Lopez spent nearly six hours chatting with Hahn,
several deputy mayors, City Council President Alex Padilla and
Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, chairwoman of the council's Public
Safety Committee.</LD>
<LD>   Lopez smiled but said nothing to reporters as he got into his car
after the interview. The mayor similarly declined to detail his time
with Lopez, beyond listing what Hahn and the former Los Angeles
Police Department deputy chief had for lunch--sandwiches, salad,
fruit and cookies.</LD>
<TE>   "Everything went very well," Hahn said after Lopez drove off. "We
had a very open and frank discussion about policing, about the
department, about the chief's experiences. I want to really get a
strong view of each candidate's vision for the department, and that's
what we did today."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn and the other city officials are to meet today and Wednesday
with the remaining finalists: William Bratton, former commissioner of
the New York Police Department, and John Timoney, Philadelphia's
former police commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla characterized the interview as cordial and friendly.
Lopez, 52, outlined plans to cut crime, improve department morale and
recruit and retain officers, Padilla said.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez became Oxnard's chief in 1998 after 28 years on the Los
Angeles force. He left the LAPD after Mayor Richard Riordan, passing
him over for chief, chose Bernard C. Parks. Hahn later denied Parks a
second five-year term, creating the vacancy.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD has about 9,000 officers; Oxnard has 200.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla said Lopez also discussed a string of police shootings in
his Ventura County city. In the first eight months of 2001, Oxnard
officers shot and killed five men, most of them mentally ill,
prompting the chief to order training on how to calm disturbed
suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Los Angeles Police Commission passed over six LAPD
insiders to name Bratton, Lopez and Timoney as finalists for the
chief's job. Hahn will make the final selection, subject to City
Council approval. No date has been set for the decision.</TE>

<LD>Labor interests have filed suit challenging the constitutionality of
Measure V, the ballot measure passed by voters in March that created
a charter for Orange County government.</LD>
<LD>   According to the suit filed in Orange County Superior Court, the
charter didn't follow state guidelines for how counties should
establish home rule. Out of eight steps, the new charter fulfilled
only one, the suit alleges.</LD>
<LD>   "It unhinged us from state government without a full debate," said
Joe Kerr, one of four plaintiffs and president of the Orange County
Professional Firefighters Assn. "It's left us with more questions
than answers."</LD>
<TE>   The charter was drafted by Supervisor Todd Spitzer with a single
provision: to fill supervisorial vacancies by election. In counties
without their own charters, the governor chooses appointees to fill
vacancies on boards of supervisors. The charter incorporated all
other existing state laws pertaining to counties.</TE>

<LD>A seismic hazard map covering a 51-square-mile area in south Orange
County--including parts of San Juan Capistrano, Rancho Santo
Margarita and Coto de Caza--has been released by the state Department
of Conservation.</LD>
<LD>   The new Canada Gobernada quadrangle map shows which areas are in
danger of landslides or liquefaction in the event of a strong
earthquake. Property where a seismic hazard is identified is subject
to special geological studies before most buildings can be
constructed and special disclosure rules when they are sold.</LD>
<LD>   The map is available for public review at local planning offices,
the county recorder's office and online at gmw.consrv.ca.gov/shmp.
Copies may be purchased by calling the department at (213) 239-0878.
It is one of 17 official seismic hazard maps in Orange County, part
of an ongoing project to map the entire county.</LD>

<HD>Lowered Aquifer Will Raise Water Imports and Cost</HD>
<DH>Utilities: Agency says too much has been pumped, and buying
elsewhere may increase users' rates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Too much water has been drawn from Orange County's vast underground
aquifer, which will mean more imported water at greater cost for more
than 2 million people, officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we're looking at higher water rates next year," said Ron
Wildermuth, spokesman for the Orange County Water District, which
manages the massive underground basin that serves the northern and
central parts of the county. "We're at a turning point."</LD>
<LD>   Officials realized this year that population growth coupled with
significantly below-average rainfall meant too much water was being
pulled from the basin.</LD>
<TE>   To offset that, 23 cities and local water agencies will have to
reduce their reliance on local ground water and increase consumption
of imported water, which costs more than three times as much. Local
water rates would also rise to pay for developing new ways to
replenish the ground water. No shortages are expected, however.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, 75% of the drinking water in northern and central
Orange County is drawn from the ground water, which costs $127 per
acre-foot (an acre-foot is roughly enough to serve two households for
a year). The remainder is imported at $450 per acre-foot from
Northern California and the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   The water basin, which is as deep as two Eiffel Towers and 365
square miles on its surface, holds 10 million to 40 million
acre-feet. Up to 1.5 million are usable at any one time.</TE>
<TE>   Wells pull water to the surface and into 23 local water systems.
The aquifer is replenished by rain, river water and runoff.</TE>
<TE>   Current policy dictates a target "overdraft" of 200,000 acre-feet,
which allows rainwater from two wet years to be absorbed.</TE>
<TE>   But the overdraft has grown to more than double that target.</TE>
<TE>   "This summer, it became obvious," Wildermuth said. "We're at a
turning point where we need to review the production out of the basin
versus our ability to put water back into our basin. We need to
invest in new ways to get water into the ground."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry A. King, president of the Orange County Water District, said
in a written statement, "We must back off providing 75% of the
[local] supply until we can improve our ability to acquire new water
and build facilities to put water into the ground."</TE>
<TE>   Such a move would be a new, supply-based strategy for the
district. The district has operated on a demand-based plan,
consistently providing 75% of the local need.</TE>
<TE>   The district will also consider ways to encourage conservation and
increase the amount of water replenishing the basin. Those would be
in addition to the several programs underway, such as development of
a $600-million system to turn sewage into water.</TE>
<TE>   The water district's staff will begin proposing solutions to the
Board of Directors in coming months, but no major decisions are
expected until spring. The winter rainfall could affect how deeply
cities' local supplies are cut.</TE>
<TE>   The county agency has repeatedly struggled throughout its 69-year
history in balancing withdrawals from the basin with replenishment.
It's an inexact science because drought, population growth and other
factors can skew the equation. In the late 1950s, drought pushed the
overdraft to its lowest level ever--700,000 acre-feet or 20 feet
below sea level.</TE>

<LD>The thrilling thing about flying, of course, is having so many
fascinating sights spread out below. Kevin Roderick of West L.A. was
over the Riverside area aboard a Southwest Airlines jet when a male
flight attendant said: "Those of you on the left side of the
airplane, if you look directly down, you will see (pause) my parents'
house!"</LD>
<LD>   Not your usual latte crowd: In western Australia, Jackson Sleet
saw an explosives warning at a theater that would seem to qualify for
a "Duh!" award (see photo).</LD>
<LD>   But Sleet pointed out that it was a drive-in theater in a mining
area, and the sign referred to explosives in the back of pickup
trucks.</LD>
<TE>   You'll never see a sign like this in Hollywood, of course, what
with all the movies that bomb here.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of noise: John Heckman of Downey spotted a door to an
office whose inhabitants probably couldn't be awakened by a light
knock (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   On a more belligerent note: Norm Anderson of La Mirada saw a store
sign (see photo) and observed: "It seems as if we guys are always
getting the blame!"</TE>
<TE>   Colorful crime commentary: While police logs at most Southland
newspapers stick mostly to the facts, Mel Upp of San Bernardino
noticed a more creative approach by the Mountain Messenger of
Downieville in Gold Rush country. Some examples:</TE>
<TE>   * "A suspicious white, adult male was reportedly hanging around
Downieville's bank. The list of suspects is huge."</TE>
<TE>   * "Two out-of-town little darlings were told about the curfew."</TE>
<TE>   * "A break-in was reported at the Loyalton Post Office. KID: THIS
IS A FEDERAL OFFENSE, and usually poor pickins, YOU IDIOT!"</TE>
<TE>   L.A. was a zoo back then: The Buffalo Nights Theatre company has a
casting call out for a play about one of the city's first celebrity
criminal defendants: Griffith J. Griffith. He was the wealthy miner
who donated the land that became Griffith Park.</TE>
<TE>   Seven years later, he shot his wife in the face during a drunken
rampage.</TE>
<TE>   The play, "Crazy Drunk," was described in Back Stage Weekly as a
"darkly comic memory play [that] presents a panorama of the wild
events surrounding the trial." Griffith, who said he believed his
wife was an agent of the pope at the time of the shooting, pleaded
alcoholic insanity (a new defense at the time). He was convicted and
served a year at San Quentin.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, by the way, survived. After his release, they reconciled
and he spent the last 14 years of his life with her.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: A photo appeared here of a no-clothes-hanger symbol
next to a fire sprinkler in a hotel room. The warning is there for a
reason, says Brian Simler of Bakersfield. He was at a business class
in Norman, Okla., when a colleague's wife hung some clothes from such
a device. Of the resulting deluge, he said, "What a mess! For three
days, a walk down our hallway was like trudging through a Florida
swamp."</TE>

<HD>Land Preservation Tax Challenged</HD>
<DH>Court: Lawsuit says that voters who approved the levy to
buy undeveloped sites were misled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four property owners have sued the Mountains Recreation and
Conservation Authority, claiming they were misled and seeking to
invalidate two tax districts created last month to buy and preserve
undeveloped land.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed late Friday in Los Angeles County Superior
Court, alleges that the regional park agency cannot legally tax
property owners. The suit also claims that voters, who approved the
measure by mail-in ballot, were duped into believing the new tax--$40
a year per single-family home--would be used to buy nearly 1,300
pieces of property and to clear brush.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles residents of the Santa Monica Mountains voted
overwhelmingly last month to tax themselves for the next 30 years to
buy and preserve undeveloped land. After the vote, the authority
created two tax districts that stretch from Griffith Park to Topanga
State Park.</LD>
<TE>   Attorney Rosemary D. Woodlock of Woodland Hills, who filed the
suit on behalf of the property owners and opposition group BADTAX,
accused the authority of fraud and misrepresentation in ballot
information. The suit alleges that the ballot improperly listed $7
million needed to buy 1,500 acres, known as the Eastport or Tucker
property, that the conservancy already owns. Woodlock said the
authority led voters to believe the money would go to new purchases,
not payment of a court-ordered judgment involving the purchase of the
Eastport property.</TE>
<TE>   The authority's executive officer, Joe Edmiston, disputed the
allegations, saying the Eastport property, which abuts Topanga State
Park, will be lost without funds from the tax districts.</TE>
<TE>   Authority spokeswoman Dash Stolarz called the plaintiffs "an
obstructionist group of people."</TE>
<TE>   She said the conservation group would not create tax districts
without proper authority and insisted that the ballot information was
not misleading.</TE>

<LD>City lawyers have agreed to pay $50,000 to settle three federal
lawsuits brought by a man who pleaded no contest to a felony charge
of receiving three stolen Oscar statuettes, it was disclosed Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Los Angeles City Atty. Geoffrey R.M. Plowden described the
settlement as a "fiscally sound decision" intended to spare the city
from the possibility of shelling out hundreds of thousands of dollars
more in legal fees.</LD>
<LD>   The plaintiff, Anthony K. Hart, 42, of La Puente, sued former
Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, Deputy Chief David Kalish and three
detectives, alleging false arrest and defamation, malicious
prosecution and detaining him without a warrant.</LD>
<TE>   One of three men arrested in connection with the Oscar thefts in
2000, Hart was placed on three years probation after pleading no
contest in Los Angeles County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Pleading no contest is the same as entering a guilty plea, except
that it cannot be used against the defendant in any ensuing civil
suit. That meant that the city could not use Hart's plea and
admission of wrongdoing to defend itself against his lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real technicality," Plowden said.</TE>
<TE>   Plowden said that under federal civil rights law, the city might
have been obligated to pay Hart's legal fees, regardless of the
outcome.</TE>
<TE>   He said that could have run into hundreds of thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   But he acknowledged that one of Hart's lawsuits might have
resulted in a verdict against the city.</TE>
<TE>   In that suit, LAPD detectives were accused of detaining Hart, so
they could obtain his palm prints, before they had received a
warrant.</TE>
<TE>   Plowden said the warrant was being sought but had not been issued
when Hart was detained.</TE>
<TE>   Hart is represented by civil rights lawyer Stephen Yagman, who
said in a statement that "absolutely everything we claimed Parks and
the detectives did turned out to be true in spades: the $50,000
proves that."</TE>
<TE>   Plowden said the settlement agreement, which was reached Friday,
makes clear that the city admits no wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Hart was employed as a loading-dock worker at Roadway Express in
Bell, which received a shipment of Oscars intended for winners of the
2000 Academy Awards.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks before the awards, the company discovered 55 Oscars
were missing.</TE>
<TE>   Yagman said Hart was arrested without probable cause, jailed for
six days and portrayed as the mastermind behind the theft at a
high-profile news conference called by Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Yagman said Hart did not take part in the theft but did receive
three Oscars from the man who actually stole them.</TE>
<TE>   Hart is serving a federal prison sentence on an unrelated weapons
conviction, Plowden said.</TE>

<HD>New Payroll System Would Cost County $12.7 Million</HD>
<DH>Spending: Despite looming budget cuts, supervisors today
will consider a proposal to replace the 20-year-old computer program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County supervisors today will consider buying a $12.7-million
payroll system to replace an outdated one, even as officials
acknowledge that it is a bad time for a costly new purchase.</LD>
<LD>   Programming for the county government's 20-year-old system is so
old that it is hard to find people to repair it when it crashes,
officials said. But the system being considered, PeopleSoft, based in
Pleasanton, Calif., is used by 80% of local governments in California
and is considered the gold standard for payroll reporting, Supervisor
Steve Bennett said.</LD>
<LD>   Though the county is looking at an additional $10 million in
budget cuts in coming weeks, it still makes sense to borrow to buy
the system now, Bennett said.</LD>
<TE>   "I really questioned the timing. Does it have to happen now, given
how tight our budget is?" Bennett said. "But it takes so long to
implement this thing--two or three years--that there is a real
question whether our antiquated system can make it much longer."</TE>
<TE>   County officials have been reviewing a replacement system for at
least three years. The current one was installed in 1982 and does not
have the flexibility to keep track of payroll and personnel
information for 8,000 employees, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   PeopleSoft would track pay and benefits and would be integrated
with the county's human resources department in a time-saving and
cost-efficient way, said Barbara Journet, the county's personnel
director. "Right now, we have tons of paper," she said. "Duplicates,
triplicates. Much of that will be done online."</TE>
<TE>   Employees also would be able to look up their benefits, vacation
time and even change their tax status electronically. As it stands
now, the county auditor's office fields most of those questions,
wasting valuable time, Auditor Christine Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   The current system is also riddled with glitches that cause it to
"blow up easily," said Cohen, who issues paychecks for all county
employees. "When you pay 8,000 people every two weeks, you want to
make sure the checks are timely and accurate," she said.</TE>
<TE>   County budget managers are bracing for an additional $10-million
budget cut, a loss that could result in the closure of health clinics
and the slashing of social service programs for the area's poorest
residents.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed reductions come on top of $17 million in cuts ordered
by supervisors in June to balance the county's $1.2-billion annual
budget. Even with the next round of cuts, more funding losses may be
on the way as the state copes with declining revenue, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   One bright spot is the low interest rate, probably less than 1.8%,
that the county will pay to borrow nearly $13 million for the system
upgrade. The money will be paid back over seven years, in roughly
$2-million annual installments.</TE>

<HD>Tournament Marshals Say the Darndest Things</HD>
<DH>Pasadena: Fred Rogers, Art Linkletter, Bill Cosby will lead
the parade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Tournament of Roses on Monday named three beloved senior
citizens--entertainers Bill Cosby, Art Linkletter and Fred Rogers--as
grand marshals for its child-themed 2003 parade and bowl game.</LD>
<LD>   Tournament President Gary Thomas, who per Rose Parade tradition
chooses the marshals and keeps their identity secret for weeks,
introduced Cosby and Linkletter during a ceremony at Tournament
headquarters in Pasadena. The marshals, he said, "will remind us of
all the beautiful moments we had in childhood."</LD>
<LD>   Mister Rogers, the children's TV host who turns 74 this year, was
on vacation. To represent him, Cosby carried a shopping bag, out of
which he pulled trademarks of Rogers' wardrobe--a crimson sweater and
blue tennis shoes.</LD>
<TE>   "He is in Scotland," said Cosby, 65, "and wearing nothing at all."</TE>
<TE>   Linkletter, 90, said he devotes much of his time to the lecture
circuit, where he talks about aging. After Thomas mentioned that Jan.
1, will bring the 114th Rose Parade and 89th Rose Bowl game, Cosby
quipped: "Art is older than both of those."</TE>
<TE>   The naming of multiple marshals is not unprecedented. The
Tournament had seven (winners of the Medal of Honor) in 1952, four in
1999 (including Jackie Robinson posthumously), and three (astronauts)
in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   To fit the parade theme, "Childrens' Dreams, Wishes and
Imagination," Thomas said he wanted a marshal who had dedicated a
lifetime to entertaining children. "To have three is just
incredible," he said.</TE>

<LD>After two mistrials and two years behind bars, a former Ventura gang
member accused of participating in a deadly 1999 assault was ordered
released from jail Monday as prosecutors decided not to retry the
case.</LD>
<LD>   Ramiro Salgado, 23, stood in a Ventura County courtroom, his arms
clasped behind his back, and smiled as prosecutors asked a judge to
dismiss murder and related gang charges.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Vincent J. O'Neill Jr. granted the request
and ordered Salgado freed by the end of the day.</LD>
<TE>   Salgado was the fifth and final defendant to stand trial for
murder in the death of 18-year-old William Zara. The other four were
convicted</TE>
<TE>   Zara, a theater stagehand, was outside his apartment the night of
Sept. 25, 1999, when members of a Ventura gang accused Zara's
neighbors of reporting their loud party to police.</TE>
<TE>   When Zara tried to defend his neighbors, he was beaten with a
baseball bat and a shovel, and kicked and stabbed in the chest. He
died of his wounds.</TE>
<TE>   As he walked to a holding cell, Salgado smiled at his attorney and
looked across the courtroom at his weeping mother, father and nearly
a dozen friends and family members.</TE>
<TE>   "He finally gets to come home," said Virginia Arroyo, Salgado's
aunt and godmother, as relatives embraced outside the courtroom. "I
just feel such joy and pleasure, and I'm glad it's over with."</TE>
<TE>   Westlake Village attorney Richard Loftus, who represented Salgado
in two murder trials that ended in hung juries, said he wasn't
convinced the case was over until a prosecutor handed him a copy of
the dismissal motion.</TE>
<TE>   "I was holding my breath," Loftus said. "It is obviously a case
the prosecution couldn't prove and they finally realized it."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, O'Neill declared a mistrial after jurors deadlocked on
whether Salgado was guilty of second-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   After five days of deliberation, the panel was divided 10 to 2 in
favor of acquittal.</TE>
<TE>   In May, O'Neill declared a mistrial after jurors split 9 to 3 in
favor of acquittal.</TE>
<TE>   In both trials, jurors said, the dispute centered on Salgado's
statement to police about his participation in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   During an August 2000 recorded interview with investigators,
Salgado admitted kicking and stomping Zara as the teen tried to
shield himself from the angry mob. After last week's mistrial, three
jurors said the panel could not agree on whether Salgado was telling
the truth or telling investigators what he thought they wanted to
hear.</TE>
<TE>   "There just wasn't enough evidence against him," one juror said.
Prosecutors requested time to consider refiling charges. O'Neill gave
them until Monday, when the district attorney filed a motion to
dismiss the case.</TE>
<TE>   "It is evident after successive jury trials and the careful
consideration of post-juror interviews that the case against the
defendant cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt," Senior Deputy
Dist. Atty. Bill Haney wrote in the motion.</TE>
<TE>   "As such," Haney concluded, "the people are bound by the rules of
prosecutorial ethics to request the dismissal of the case."</TE>

<HD>Suspect Shot by Officers Is ID'd</HD>
<DH>Crime: Parolee allegedly fired at police Saturday during a
traffic stop in Burbank. He is listed in critical condition.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 22-year-old parolee who was shot by Burbank police officers after
firing at them during a weekend traffic stop was identified by a
family member Monday as Carl Strunk.</LD>
<LD>   Charges related to the incident, including attempted murder of a
police officer, are pending against Strunk, who was hospitalized
after the shooting and is listed in critical condition.</LD>
<LD>   Police said he would be booked as soon as his condition improves.</LD>
<TE>   Strunk was a passenger in a car stopped by Burbank police for a
suspected traffic violation early Saturday at Olive Avenue and
Beachwood Drive.</TE>
<TE>   He pointed a gun and fired at least one shot at the officers, who
returned fire, hitting him multiple times, Burbank Police Lt. Tim
Stehr said.</TE>
<TE>   Marianne Strunk, who identified herself as the suspect's
grandmother, said her grandson, a studio prop maker, had been shot at
least six times in the neck, arms and right hand.</TE>
<TE>   She called the shooting "an overreach of authority and unnecessary
force" by police.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank police officials declined to provide any specific details
of the shooting--including the names of the officers, the types of
weapons involved or how many times Strunk was hit--pending the
outcome of an investigation by a team from the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office that looks into officer-involved
shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Stehr said the incident unfolded when the officers, on routine
patrol, pulled over a vehicle carrying four people.</TE>
<TE>   While the officers were speaking to the driver, the front
passenger pointed a gun at them and fired one round, according to
Burbank police.</TE>
<TE>   Two handguns believed to belong to Strunk were recovered from the
scene, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   No one else was injured, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Strunk, who was on parole for a narcotics-related conviction, is a
recovering drug addict, his grandmother said.</TE>

<HD>Man Killed by Truck He Allegedly Helped Steal</HD>
<DH>Crime: He apparently leaped, with Anaheim police in
pursuit. One suspect held, one flees.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man was killed late Sunday when he was run over by one of two tow
trucks that he and two companions had stolen from an Anaheim
business, police said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Luis Daniel Cabrera, 24, of Los Angeles died of massive head
trauma after he and two others stole the tow trucks at 11:52 p.m.
Sunday, said Anaheim Police Sgt. Mike Hidalgo.</LD>
<LD>   "From where they found his body, we believe he tried to jump from
the truck as it was moving," Hidalgo said. "It's obvious the truck
ran over him because he sustained massive head injuries."</LD>
<TE>   According to police, Cabrera was a passenger in one of the trucks
stolen from a truck repair business in the 4900 block of East La
Palma Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   The trucks were rammed through a locked chain-link fence. Two
police officers answering a suspicious-activity call at the site
narrowly escaped being hit by the trucks, Hidalgo said.</TE>
<TE>   As police chased the trucks, Cabrera jumped from one and was
killed, and its driver lost control and crashed into a tree,
authorities said. The driver fled on foot and was not captured.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrested the second driver, Eduardo Ochoa, 22, of Los
Angeles, after they saw him driving toward the onramp to the
westbound Riverside Freeway. Police said Ochoa abandoned the truck
before reaching the freeway and fled on foot; a police dog found him
hiding in a ditch.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa was booked into Anaheim City Jail on suspicion of vehicle
theft and assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer.</TE>

<HD>'Rice Rockets' Find Appeal in Mainstream</HD>
<DH>Modified imports are the vehicle of choice for
multicultural audience of style-conscious and speed-loving teenagers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California's "rice rockets" have gone mainstream. Maybe it
had to happen.</LD>
<LD>   A little more than 10 years ago, these customized Hondas, Acuras
and Toyotas made their debut on the local street-racing scene as a
challenge to the American muscle car tradition.</LD>
<LD>   With their eye-grabbing accessories, souped-up engines and owners
who tended to be Asian American, they became a target of ethnic
insults and the scorn of traditional performance enthusiasts.</LD>
<TE>   Nowadays, tricked-out imports are the vehicle of choice for a
multicultural audience of speed-loving and style-conscious teenagers
and young adults coast to coast, industry experts say. They can be
found in suburban high school parking lots, at small-town
drive-through restaurants and parading through hip-hop music videos.
Modified imports are so ubiquitous at UC Irvine that the college has
been nicknamed the University of Civics and Integras.</TE>
<TE>   "It's everyone and everywhere," said one UC Irvine student, Bruce
Bradford, 21, the proud owner of a Honda Civic coupe that he has
lowered two inches and outfitted with an oversized exhaust pipe tip,
showy wheels and mud flaps painted white to match the rest of his
car. "Image has a big influence--friends who say, 'This looks cool.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Although 18- to 25-year-olds make up the core of compact
performance enthusiasts, the trend cuts across all races, as well as
both genders, according to the Specialty Equipment Market Assn., a
Diamond Bar-based trade group for manufacturers of aftermarket auto
parts and accessories.</TE>
<TE>   The group's research indicates that nationally whites make up 42%
of so-called "import tuners;" Asians, 29%; Latinos, 16%; and African
Americans, 8%. Seventeen percent are female.</TE>
<TE>   Such diversity has helped fuel a multibillion-dollar market for
exotic-looking spoilers, side panels and fenders, fancy gear knobs
and Indiglo-lit gauges, the latest DVD systems and
performance-enhancing engine parts that allow a humble four-cylinder
to take on a venerable V-8 at a stoplight--and win.</TE>
<TE>   With the average "tuner" spending $5,000 annually on customizing
his car, sales of components made especially for compact cars have
gone from $295 million in 1997 to a projected figure of $2.5 billion
this year, said Jim Spoonhower, vice president of market research for
the Specialty Equipment Market Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "You still have a percentage within that 18-to-25 age group that
will be content driving a car just the way it came off the lot. But
you have a larger percentage that feels like they want to do
something to the car," Spoonhower said.</TE>
<TE>   The fad got a big push last year with the release of "The Fast and
the Furious," a film that brought the world of import-loving Southern
California street racers to the big screen and grossed $144.5 million
at the box office.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Lieberman, the movie's technical director and former head of
the National Import Racing Assn., said even those within the auto
industry had been shocked by the momentum the film generated.</TE>
<TE>   "What company would have predicted that, after 'The Fast and the
Furious,' sales of neon [body] kits would go up 1,300% for every
company that carried them, that the whole thing is so glamorized that
everybody is going to want to be a part of it," said Lieberman, 39, a
self-described "sick car person" who lives in Orange County and whose
own fully loaded Toyota Supra played a starring role in the movie.</TE>
<TE>   With a sequel now in the works--this time it's being shot in
Florida instead of L.A.--Lieberman is once again helping the director
and producers find the right cars for the project.</TE>
<TE>   During an open vehicle casting call in early July in Santa Monica,
nearly 500 people showed up hoping to have their cars selected for
one of the dozen or so main parts. This though the event had been
advertised only 36 hours before on Lieberman's Web site, movie
carz.com.</TE>
<TE>   "People came from four different states and drove all night to get
here," he said. "These people spend a lot of time and money on their
cars, and the opportunity to have it on screen, whether it's five
seconds or 35 seconds--it's great for them."</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, the producers decided to have their cars built
for the primary roles instead of renting them. The decision was based
on the difficulty and expense of creating stunt reproductions of
import cars that had already been extensively modified with the
intent of making them one-of-a-kind, Lieberman said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because of the trend's origins in illegal street racing,
or simply because of the generation gap that separates advertising
executives from import performance enthusiasts, most auto makers have
been slow to capitalize on the car craze.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Honda was set to unveil its first Civic campaign
featuring souped-up street versions of its cars. The commercial, shot
in downtown Los Angeles at night, includes 65 area young people and
their rides done up with flashy paint jobs, turbocharged engines, and
specialized lights that a dealer isn't likely to throw in with a set
of floor mats.</TE>
<TE>   Any doubt that imports are "in" dissolves after a visit to
Fullerton Town Center, an outdoor shopping center that is one of
several spots where young car buffs gather for cruise nights.</TE>
<TE>   With the sounds of revving engines and squealing tires filling the
air behind the In-N-Out Burger and clusters of youths bent over open
hoods and rear hatches, it is a scene straight out of "American
Graffiti," with one notable exception: Japanese-designed imports
outnumbered domestic cars and trucks by at least 2 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Hean, 21, of Long Beach was there to show off his 1995
Acura Integra GSR. He has owned the car for a year and has already
spent nearly $5,000 customizing it with engine enhancements such as a
reprogrammed computer chip to boost performance, and cosmetic
alterations ranging from a $400 red racing seat to blue-tinged
taillights.</TE>
<TE>   Like other compact tuners, Hean, who has worked as a Mercedes-Benz
mechanic, said he was drawn to imports for their affordability,
reliability and potential for creative expression.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the fact we are using a small-displacement engine and can
beat a Camaro V-8 with a little time and money," he said. "You get
all that, plus the girls are looking for the imports too. They know
it's the thing to do right now."</TE>
<TE>   As with any cultural phenomenon that has gone from cult status to
mass appeal in a short time, "rice rocket" styles are continuing to
evolve at warp speed as trendsetters try to stay a step ahead of the
masses and on the cutting edge. Imports tricked out with big rear
wings, black wheel rims and neon-lighted underbodies--the type of
designs that appeared in "The Fast and the Furious"--are already
considered passe. The new look favored by the cognoscenti, fashioned
after the latest models domestically produced in Japan, is cleaner,
with fewer exterior frills.</TE>
<TE>   So does the hobby's popularity signal its ultimate demise? Its
pioneers insist not, arguing that, as Generation Y ages, today's
Civic and Integra owners will continue to funnel their energy and
disposable income into more expensive imports and higher-end parts.</TE>
<TE>   "The passion these kids enjoy for their sport is unrivaled,"
Lieberman said. "I can't remember when one particular element has
been so exciting to a group of people."</TE>

<HD>New Airport Screener Jobs Going Mostly to Whites</HD>
<DH>Diversity: Before the 9/11 attacks, minorities were a
majority of the work force. Citizenship rule, test are questioned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR and JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The federal takeover of aviation security is spurring a demographic
shift at airports around the country, as thousands of screener jobs
in which minorities were heavily represented increasingly appear to
be going to whites.</LD>
<LD>   Statistics from the Transportation Security Administration
indicate that Latinos and Asian Americans are finding it particularly
difficult to land the new, higher-paying federal screener positions.
As of mid-September, a majority of the 21,983 new hires were white.</LD>
<LD>   At issue are a citizenship requirement for federal screeners and a
preemployment test that the current workers allege is discriminatory.</LD>
<TE>   The TSA "is not as diverse as my expectation was," said Rep. Ed
Pastor (D-Ariz.), a member of the House panel that oversees aviation
security funding. "They need to look at their hiring practices and
say, 'We're coming up short.' "</TE>
<TE>   The agency, however, says it is pleased with its efforts to hire
minorities. "We're right on target, and in some cases better,"
spokeswoman Heather Rosenker said. She defended the preemployment
test as an objective assessment developed by experts in the personnel
field.</TE>
<TE>   The TSA has yet to take over security screening at Los Angeles
International Airport, where minorities account for an estimated 98%
of the security screeners. All are employees of private companies.
African Americans make up about half the work force; Latinos, 20%;
Asians, 14%; and Africans, 14%, according to the Service Employees
International Union, which represents the workers.</TE>
<TE>   The emerging TSA security force looks substantially different.
Federal screeners are gradually replacing private security employees
in a transition that is supposed to be completed by Nov. 19.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, whites account for 61% of the federal screeners, while
21% are black, 10% Latino, 2% Asian and 1% American Indian, according
to TSA statistics. This month at the St. Louis airport, African
American screeners shut down checkpoints for 10 minutes to draw
attention to their complaints that they were being left out of the
new federal jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The TSA has also encountered problems hiring female screeners. It
initially set a goal that half the workers would be women, in order
to address reported abuses by male screeners searching female
passengers. Yet only 31% of the new hires are women.</TE>
<TE>   There are no figures on the ethnicity of screeners before the
Sept. 11 attacks, but a former Federal Aviation Administration
security chief said the work force was overwhelmingly made up of
minorities.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in a lot of airports, and it sure seemed that way to me,"
said Cathal Flynn, who headed the FAA security branch from 1993 to
2000. "I remember one of the senior managers in the FAA saying, 'I'll
know those are good jobs when I see white guys working in them.' He
himself was black."</TE>
<TE>   SEIU researcher Robert Masciola agreed. "At the top 100 airports,
which employed 80% of the screeners, I would definitely say it was a
majority-minority work force," said Masciola, who assisted in the
union drive to organize the workers at eight of the nation's largest
airports.</TE>
<TE>   The new TSA jobs pay $23,600 to $35,400 a year, plus benefits. The
private security screener jobs often paid minimum wage.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the same job," said Elizabeth Kolmstetter, a TSA
official who oversees training standards for the new work force. "The
job screeners knew previously is not the same job TSA is putting out
there. We need a work force that can keep up with change."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the job requirements were set by Congress and cannot be
changed by the TSA, said Rosenker, the spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   For many Latinos and Asians, a key barrier to TSA employment is
that Congress required the agency to recruit only U.S. citizens.
Other federal agencies--including the Defense Department--do not have
to apply such sweeping citizenship rules. About 31,000 noncitizens
are on active duty in the armed forces, enough for a couple of Army
divisions. Legally, none of them could be a federal airport screener.
An amendment pending in the Senate, sponsored by Sen. Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.), would waive the citizenship requirement for
current screeners who are permanent U.S. residents.</TE>
<TE>   Another barrier, say union officials at LAX, is a battery of
preemployment tests that includes a ninth-grade-level English exam.</TE>
<TE>   Of 120 LAX screeners who recently volunteered to take a practice
English test, all flunked. Union organizers said they're concerned
about the relevance of the exam to a screener's job.</TE>
<TE>   "What's getting a lot of people is the diction, which is very
subjective," said Javier Gonzalez, an SEIU organizer. "This is
currently predominantly a people-of-color industry."</TE>
<TE>   National civil rights organizations complain that the TSA has not
done enough to reach out to minorities.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been extremely frustrated, because we've had a couple of
meetings with TSA about the need to do some targeted advertising, and
we have not gotten much in the way of cooperation," said Karen
Narasaki, executive director of the National Asian Pacific American
Legal Consortium.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's important for the employees to look diverse, because
that will take away from the stereotype that the people doing the
searching are all going to be white and the people being searched are
going to be people of color," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Responded Rosenker: "Our advertising schedule shows we are in
ethnic publications."</TE>
<TE>   At LAX, new federal security director David Stone has been adamant
that he wants to retain as much of his current work force as
possible.</TE>
<TE>   "My current screening force is my family," Stone said at a recent
orientation meeting in which he explained the hiring process.
Screeners now at LAX are employed by private companies under contract
to the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   "You're the ones protecting us day in and day out," Stone told the
screeners. "I desperately want to retain every one of you."</TE>
<TE>   He faces long odds. At least 40% of the 1,200 current screeners
are not U.S. citizens, ruling them out as candidates for the federal
work force.</TE>
<TE>   From a security standpoint, the citizenship requirement is
"strange," said former FAA official Flynn. At overseas
airports--where the terrorist threat is generally acknowledged to be
higher--U.S.-bound passengers are routinely screened by foreigners,
Flynn pointed out.</TE>
<TE>   "Overseas, including in places like the Middle East, we have to
rely on foreign nationals as screeners, and their backgrounds are
checked by foreign governments," Flynn said. "It is strange that we
have this insistence on U.S. citizens, but we're only doing it in the
United States."</TE>
<TE>   Citizenship appears to be only one dimension of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "A citizenship test by itself should not justify a low number of
Latinos," said Cecilia Munoz, vice president of the National Council
of La Raza. "Roughly 60% of Latinos are born here."</TE>
<TE>   Union representatives, who spent three years organizing screeners
at LAX, allege that the TSA exam and its English test are
discriminatory. Lower-income minorities will be replaced with
middle-class retirees and law enforcement officers, they allege.</TE>
<TE>   "We are concerned with what's happened at other airports--the
drastic demographic shifts," said Maria Loya, director of public
policy for the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy. "We definitely
wouldn't want to see this happen at LAX. The majority of current
screeners are coming from communities that are very impoverished."</TE>
<TE>   While Congress mandated that federal screeners be proficient in
English, it left it up to the TSA to decide how best to accomplish
that.</TE>
<TE>   Other federal agencies do not employ such a standardized English
test, said Rusty Asher, a spokesman for the federal Office of
Personnel Management. Instead, they check employment and educational
history, and interviewers then make a judgment about whether a job
candidate has the needed oral and written English skills.</TE>
<TE>   The TSA test requires job candidates to read at the ninth-grade
level or higher, said Stone, the agency's security director at LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Wagner, a literacy expert at the University of Pennsylvania,
said that requirement is too high for most people who are not native
speakers.</TE>
<TE>   "The average reading level of adults in the United States is
eighth- to 10th-grade," Wagner said. "If you look at people who are
not native speakers, I would guess that level would be two grades
lower."</TE>
<TE>   English proficiency requirements for becoming a citizen are much
less stringent, Wagner added. "By having a high English requirement,
[the TSA] may be cutting out some people who could be quite adequate
at the job of security," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The TSA adopted the requirement after considerable study, said
agency official Kolmstetter. Screener positions are now considered
technical positions, not blue-collar jobs. "It is a skilled work
force reading requirement, as opposed to an unskilled work force,"
she said. "There is a lot more reading required on the job."</TE>
<TE>   Stone and officials at the Los Angeles city agency that operates
LAX are offering English classes for current screeners in the hopes
of boosting their chances.</TE>

<LD>Trucks that send shock waves into the Earth to help pinpoint oil
reserves will be used for exploration in the Canyons of the Ancients
National Monument, under an agreement announced Monday.</LD>
<LD>   A lawsuit that halted the plan last month was settled Friday after
environmentalists and oil companies agreed to restrictions that would
protect the archeologically sensitive area in southwestern Colorado
from destruction.</LD>
<LD>   The Interior Department has said the monument has the highest
known density of archeological sites in the country.</LD>
<TE>   Four groups filed the lawsuit after the Bureau of Land Management
approved the plan Aug. 9.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement calls for moving "thumper trucks" away from
archeological sites and keeping their vibration in some areas on dirt
roads. Experts will accompany the exploration team to identify
sensitive sites.</TE>

<HD>2 Die, 3 Missing as Boat Sinks in a Texas Lake</HD>
<DH>Accident: A survivor swims more than a mile to shore to get
help for rescue operation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>A boat carrying 10 family members and friends on a late-night outing
struck an underwater obstruction and sank early Monday. Two people
were killed and three others were missing and feared dead,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The rest were rescued after a survivor, Sara Guzman, swam more
than a mile to shore to get help.</LD>
<LD>   Lakeside resident Gary Gilliam called for help after he found
Guzman sprawled on rocks by the shore of Lake Ray Hubbard about 3
a.m., roughly three hours after the 16-foot boat struck something and
rapidly took on water.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't believe she made it across," Gilliam told reporters.
"It's almost two miles."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking through a Spanish interpreter, Guzman, 22, said she was
afraid to swim but God gave her "valor" to continue across the lake
for nearly three hours.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not think I was a strong swimmer, but I became very
courageous," Guzman said.</TE>
<TE>   There were only two life jackets aboard the boat, Dallas Fire
Rescue Lt. Doug Dickerson said.</TE>
<TE>   Two boys, ages 6 and 15, survived by huddling in the water with an
18-year-old woman wearing one of the life jackets.</TE>
<TE>   A 20-year-old man wearing the other life jacket was rescued
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   The survivors were uninjured.</TE>
<TE>   The bodies of Rosa Isela Holguin, 38, and Elizabeth Guzman, 18,
were pulled from the water. The search continued for the missing: a
12-year-old girl and two men, ages 39 and 21.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said hope for finding survivors was all but gone and
the focus had shifted to recovering remains.</TE>
<TE>   Several relatives of the boaters quietly waited for information in
an upscale neighborhood overlooking the lake.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Justice Department challenged the state's assisted suicide
law, asking an appeals court to strike down the first-in-the-nation
measure as a violation of federal laws that bar doctors from easing
patients toward death.</LD>
<LD>   In a filing with the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco, lawyers for the Justice Department argued that federal
regulations prohibit doctors from prescribing lethal doses of
controlled drugs or other medications.</LD>
<LD>   "The attorney general has permissibly concluded that suicide is
not a legitimate medical purpose," the government said in its court
papers, citing the provisions of the federal Controlled Substances
Act.</LD>
<TE>   Oregon's law was first approved by voters in 1994 and reaffirmed
in 1997. Since 1997, at least 70 people, most of them terminally ill,
have killed themselves with drugs in Oregon.</TE>

<HD>Bush Travels to New Jersey to Support Senate Challenger</HD>
<DH>Politics: GOP has seized on Democrat Torricelli's ethics
problems in its effort to retake chamber. President's appearance
raises $1.5 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TRENTON, N.J.</DL>
<LD>President Bush waded into New Jersey's bare-knuckles Senate race
Monday, campaigning for Republican candidate Douglas R. Forrester in
a contest both parties now see as pivotal to their hopes in November.</LD>
<LD>   Bush spoke at a $1.5-million fund-raising luncheon here for the
former seminarian and Eagle Scout, who seems like a made-to-order
challenger to Democrat Robert Torricelli, a scandal-tainted
incumbent.</LD>
<LD>   Torricelli had been favored to win reelection until the Senate
Select Committee on Ethics in July "severely admonished" him for poor
judgment and a failure to heed Senate rules in accepting expensive
gifts from a major campaign contributor.</LD>
<TE>   Torricelli accepted the finding and said he would comply with the
committee's demand that he pay fair-market value for the items given
to him, relatives and friends, which included a big-screen
television, a CD player and earrings.</TE>
<TE>   On the campaign trail, he has apologized to voters and sought to
change the subject. But Forrester, who was little-known statewide
when the race started, has not let up a torrent of criticism of
Torricelli's ethics lapses.</TE>
<TE>   Recent polls have shown the race a virtual dead heat. That's never
a good sign for an incumbent. And it's especially troublesome for
Torricelli, because New Jersey has strong Democratic leanings and is
a state that the party's presidential nominee, Al Gore, easily won in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   The New Jersey race has taken on national significance because,
with the Senate's current lineup of 50 Democrats, 49 Republicans and
one independent, a shift of just one seat on Nov. 5 could tip the
balance.</TE>
<TE>   The Democrat-controlled Senate has frustrated a variety of Bush
priorities--a fact that the president noted with some fervor on
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   He did not mention Torricelli by name or take direct note of the
senator's problems in his remarks at the Forrester fund-raiser or in
earlier public comments in Trenton.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Bush urged voters to send Forrester, a wealthy
businessman and onetime mayor of West Windsor, N.J., to the Senate to
help him achieve his legislative agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "I need somebody up there to work with me," Bush said, calling
Forrester "a man who will be a breath of fresh air for New Jersey in
the United States Senate."</TE>
<TE>   The president hewed to his familiar approach in his fund-raising
speech, avoiding overtly partisan language while delivering a
nonpartisan update on the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Forrester flew to Trenton with the president aboard Air Force One.</TE>
<TE>   In introducing Bush at the fund-raiser, Forrester recalled that
Bush in his 2000 campaign promised to restore "honesty and integrity"
to the Oval Office, a clear reference to the sexual scandal that led
to President Clinton's impeachment.</TE>
<TE>   "Similarly, Mr. President, this campaign is about restoring
honesty and integrity to the office of the United States senator from
New Jersey," Forrester said.</TE>
<TE>   Torricelli's campaign manager, Ken Snyder, scoffed at the effect
of Bush's visit. And, in line with Torricelli's campaign strategy,
Snyder tried to focus attention on the issues, not the candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, he said, wants a Republican Senate majority "to vote for his
plans to privatize Social Security and appoint anti-choice justices
to the Supreme Court."</TE>
<TE>   In another sign of the race's importance, Senate Majority Leader
Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) traveled to New Jersey to campaign with
Torricelli.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department spent three years investigating whether
David Chang gave Torricelli gifts to gain his assistance in business
dealings.</TE>
<TE>   The inquiry was closed in January, with no charges against the
senator. Chang is now serving 18 months in prison for making illegal
contributions to Torricelli's 1996 Senate campaign.</TE>
<TE>   With control of the House also at stake in the midterm elections,
Bush will be stepping up his travels around the country on behalf of
GOP candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Today, he is to attend a fund-raiser in Washington for Rep. John
R. Thune (R-S.D.), who is trying to unseat Sen. Tim Johnson (D-S.D.).</TE>
<TE>   Later this week, Bush is scheduled to campaign in Texas, Colorado
and Arizona.</TE>

<HD>Globalization Activists Go to Charm School</HD>
<DH>Advocacy: Experts say the movement in U.S. has matured,
gained support and had an effect since '99 Seattle WTO protests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a church basement a couple of miles from the citadels of
international finance, opponents of globalization are trying to
revive the spirit of Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   An anti-globalization garage band unleashes a sonic barrage titled
"Third World Scene." The Anti-Authoritarian Babysitters Club offers
to keep an eye on infants of the revolution. Forty or so protest
planners stand shoulder to shoulder in a circle and chant "Si, se
puede" over and over.</LD>
<LD>   Translation: Yes, it can be done. Even after Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly three years after 50,000 protesters virtually shut down a
meeting of global trade officials in Seattle, activists would be
pleased to mobilize a mere 10,000 when the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank hold their fall meetings in Washington this
weekend. In the aftermath of last year's terrorist attacks, which
made any form of civil disobedience seem unpatriotic, even that goal
may be optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   But there's more to a movement than street theater and crowd
counts. Authorities on development issues, including some of
globalization's stalwart defenders, say the movement in this country
has broadened, matured and become more influential in the 33 months
since Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "The movement is getting much more sophisticated, even the
activists in the streets," said Nancy Birdsall, a former World Bank
official who heads the Center for Global Development in Washington.
"It's gone from anti-globalization to alternative globalization to
managing globalization."</TE>
<TE>   Development experts credit activist pressure at least in part for
a range of developments, including a decision by the World Bank to
give poor countries a bigger voice in developing poverty-reduction
plans and agreement by the World Trade Organization to give top
priority to the needs of poor countries in the round of worldwide
trade talks launched last year.</TE>
<TE>   Globalization critics denounce some of those initiatives as
inadequate. But if nothing else, they represent an acknowledgment
that wealthy nations and their financial institutions cannot afford
to appear indifferent to global injustice.</TE>
<TE>   "They won the verbal and policy battle," said Gary Hufbauer, a
pro-globalization economist at the Institute for International
Economics in Washington. "They did shift policy. Are they happy that
they shifted it enough? No, they're not ever going to be totally
happy, because they're always pushing."</TE>
<TE>   Experts see evidence of the movement's growing influence in other
arenas.</TE>
<TE>   Several high-profile economists, including Nobel Prize winner
Joseph Stiglitz, have endorsed some of the specific criticisms and
objectives of the movement. Their critique was reinforced by growing
evidence of the failure of "Washington consensus" formulas to foster
growth in Africa, Asia and Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of Third World debt relief resonated with a much wider
audience when Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Irish rock star
Bono jointly toured some of sub-Saharan Africa's poorest countries.</TE>
<TE>   Many development experts point to Jubilee 2000, the Third World
debt-relief group whose work has been championed by Bono, as the
non-government organization with perhaps the most influence over
public policymaking.</TE>
<TE>   "Jubilee 2000 had a tremendous impact in mobilizing focus and
political support for the decisions that were eventually made," said
Mats Karlsson, the World Bank's vice president for external affairs.
The result, he said, "is a very radical debt relief program that is
now being implemented country by country."</TE>
<TE>   Other groups have had an effect too. Oxfam, the London-based
relief organization, made waves with a report stating that more trade
liberalization, if managed properly, is the best prescription for
reducing world poverty. The International Labor Organization has
convened a high-profile working group to assess the social
implications of globalization.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the major organizations have grown enormously more
powerful and effective. The only thing that's shrunk is the street
protests," said Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the liberal Center for
Economic and Policy Research in Washington. "The movement hasn't lost
momentum at all. It just shifted to a different set of tactics."</TE>
<TE>   For every organization involved in what some call the "movement of
movements," there have also been smaller but symbolically important
victories.</TE>
<TE>   Jubilee USA's crusade has been joined by a remarkably wide range
of organizations, from conservative evangelical churches to the San
Francisco 49ers football team.</TE>
<TE>   For the World Bank Bond Boycott, which hopes to generate the kind
of financial pressure that helped end apartheid, a big turning point
was the Milwaukee City Council's 13-1 vote this spring to join the
campaign. "We've seen a huge shift," said boycott coordinator Neil
Watkins. "When we started in 2000, there's no way we could have even
talked to the city of Milwaukee."</TE>
<TE>   Leaders say the movement's evolving profile reflects a deliberate
decision to tone down the increasingly provocative street
mobilizations staged outside meetings of the IMF, World Bank, World
Trade Organization and other global institutions.</TE>
<TE>   Although authorities said the vast majority of participants were
peaceful, small groups of Black Bloc anarchists and other extremists
were giving the protests a violent edge. In Seattle, their antics
contributed to $2 million in property damage and 500 arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Sept. 11. Public revulsion for terrorism and heightened
concern about security created even more ambivalence within the
movement about the merits of street mobilizations.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-globalization groups had been planning a Seattle-size protest
at the fall 2001 meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington,
but the sessions were canceled shortly after Sept. 11. When the
institutions held their spring meetings here in April, only 1,000 or
so protesters rallied outside their headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "After 9/11, the U.S. movement obviously reevaluated its tactics
and its tone," said Lori Wallach, who has directed Public Citizen's
Global Trade Watch operation since 1990. "But even before 9/11, there
was a strategy judgment that we needed to diversify the ways in which
we organized and mobilized."</TE>
<TE>   Wallach said the movement's current level of energy and engagement
far exceeds what prevailed during the struggle over ratification of
the North American Free Trade Agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, you could have put 15 people on a bus--activists,
labor leaders, members of Congress--and if that bus went over a
cliff, it would have been the end of the NAFTA campaign," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Today, a whole fleet of plummeting buses wouldn't slow the
movement much.</TE>
<TE>   Although the ranks of street protesters have thinned, they may be
more diverse. Jubilee USA, which declined to participate in past
mobilizations because of concerns about potential violence, will be
part of the action this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   National coordinator Marie Clarke said Jubilee decided to join the
crowd because organizers made a stronger commitment to nonviolence,
and because the AIDS epidemic and endemic poverty were rapidly
worsening in the Third World.</TE>
<TE>   "As fast as we've been working and as successful as we've been so
far, I feel like we're really running out of time," Clarke said.
"When the long-term advocacy people working in the system finally
have to go to the streets, it tells you there's an urgency there."</TE>
<TE>   David Levy, one of the protest coordinators stationed in the
basement bunker of St. Stephen's Episcopal Church, scoffs at
suggestions that the movement has lost its edge.</TE>
<TE>   "In social movements, there's kind of a good-cop, bad-cop
phenomenon," said Levy, who works with the umbrella group
Mobilization for Global Justice. "We go out in the streets and
confront the evils of these institutions with very hard rhetoric.
There are others who say, 'Negotiate with us,' and get a seat at the
table.</TE>
<TE>   "They wouldn't get that seat without the pressure from the
street."</TE>

<HD>South Texas Gulf Coast Braces for Isidore</HD>
<DH>Weather: The tropical storm could regain hurricane strength
as it hits open water today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>SOUTH PADRE ISLAND, Texas</DL>
<LD>Shrimp boats streamed into port and residents stocked up on supplies
for boarding up windows Monday as Tropical Storm Isidore threatened
to regain hurricane strength and hit the Gulf Coast.</LD>
<LD>   As of Monday afternoon, the storm was stalled over Mexico's
Yucatan Peninsula, about 660 miles southeast of South Padre Island.</LD>
<LD>   Forecasters said the storm could regain hurricane intensity as it
moves over warm water in the Gulf of Mexico today.</LD>
<TE>   Moisture linked to Isidore combined with other storm activity to
drench parts of the Texas coast Monday. High water kicked up by
Isidore crested over dunes and onto the northern end of South Padre
Island's main road. Workers piled up sand to prevent flooding.</TE>
<TE>   The National Weather Service posted flood alerts from Brownsville
about 90 miles north to Baffin Bay, as coastal residents stocked up
on plywood to protect their windows from hurricane-force wind.</TE>
<TE>   In its march across the Yucatan, the storm peeled roofs off homes
and snapped trees in an area scattered with colonial cities, Mayan
ruins and nature reserves.</TE>
<TE>   As authorities worked to restore communication across the
peninsula, Yucatan Gov. Patricio Patron reported two dead.</TE>
<TE>   President Vicente Fox toured the nearby community of Kanasin late
Monday, stopping at a school whose windows were shattered and halls
were flooded by the storm.</TE>
<TE>   "We will do all that we can as fast as we can," he told the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Isidore was downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved inland over
the Yucatan, tossing uprooted trees onto Merida's famous Paseo de
Montejo.</TE>
<TE>   Isidore also caused heavy rains in Guatemala, where officials said
two people drowned when they tried to cross a rain-swollen river.</TE>
<TE>   The storm was expected to regain speed and move within 250 miles
of the South Texas coast by Wednesday, weather service meteorologist
Richard Hagan said.</TE>
<TE>   From there, forecasters said, the storm could parallel the Texas
coast, causing damage from high seas, then hit inland near Louisiana
as early as Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Texas and Louisiana officials braced for a worst-case scenario: a
long, watery trek up hundreds of miles of coastline.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in southwestern Louisiana were on alert, but no
immediate evacuations were ordered. Gov. Mike Foster declared a state
of emergency to clear the way for state help if needed.</TE>

<HD>Car Booster Seats Defective, Parents Allege in Recall Bid</HD>
<DH>Safety: At least 18 deaths are linked to children's
product. Families to petition firm today to pull item, citing the
lack of a harness restraint.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The parents of 3-year-old Patricia Fairfax and those of Christopher
Armstrong, 2, thought they were keeping their car-bound children
safe. They put them in booster seats that used padded plastic
barriers across the chest instead of straps to hold toddlers in
place.</LD>
<LD>   But Patricia and Christopher were killed in separate crashes while
younger siblings, riding in car seats with built-in straps, survived.</LD>
<LD>   Today, a group of parents and their lawyers will petition
Canada-based Dorel Industries to voluntarily recall as many as 10
million of the booster seats. In a letter to Dorel Chief Executive
Martin Schwartz, the parents contend that the seat is defective
because it "has no harness restraint to retain the upper torso."</LD>
<TE>   Dorel's Cosco unit is the only company still manufacturing the
"shield boosters," which hark back to early child-seat designs. Cosco
says tests by the U.S. government and by experts hired by the company
validate the seats.</TE>
<TE>   "This product is a safe product that is saving children's lives,"
said Ken Mitchell, a company spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Although many safety advocates and the American Academy of
Pediatrics recommend that parents not use shield boosters, the seats
continue to be sold because they meet minimum federal safety
standards.</TE>
<TE>   Priced as low as $20, they are also a bargain.</TE>
<TE>   Children have allegedly been injured in two ways: by being ejected
during rollovers and by breaking their necks or injuring their heads
as they are thrown forward, doubled over, in severe head-on
collisions.</TE>
<TE>   Trial lawyers have compiled records of at least 18 deaths blamed
on Cosco shield boosters from 1987 through 2001. The company sold a
seat called the Explorer starting in 1985 and replaced it with the
Grand Explorer in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   The government's auto safety agency--the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration--has received reports of six deaths and eight
injuries in 14 crashes. "It's being closely monitored," said
spokesman Rae Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulators should do more than monitor the situation, said
Ann Brown, who chaired the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission
from 1994 to 2001. "I would label this shield booster a booby trap
for babies," said Brown. "You obviously have a problem here, and you
don't need a bunch of dead babies to pile up before you take action."</TE>
<TE>   The auto safety agency has been criticized for sending mixed
messages about the seats.</TE>
<TE>   In a safety brochure issued during the Clinton administration, the
agency pictured a child in a shield booster with an emphatic, bold
"NO!" But in its latest consumer advice, it does not take a stand and
merely reports the recommendation of the pediatrics group.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to get the word out for parents to stay away from those
car seats because they're unsafe," said Patricia's father, Alfred
Fairfax of Fayetteville, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   After his 1996 crash, Fairfax said his neighbors got rid of shield
boosters they had bought for their own children. "They absolutely
took them out of their cars and threw them away," he said. The Easter
Sunday wreck was caused by another driver, who apparently fell asleep
and hit Fairfax's 1994 Chevrolet Cavalier head-on.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia was in the center of the back seat, the position regarded
by experts as the safest for a child, her father said. She died of a
broken neck.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting to Patricia's right was sister Heather, 2 at the time.
Buckled into a car seat with shoulder straps, she suffered only a
broken leg.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Cosco settled a lawsuit brought by the Fairfax family.
The company paid a confidential sum without acknowledging liability.</TE>
<TE>   A nurse from Victoria, Texas, says her experience belies Cosco's
claims that its seats are safe. Melanie Armstrong's son, Christopher,
died after being ejected from the family's Plymouth Voyager in a 1999
rollover. The minivan went off the edge of the road on a curve, and
Armstrong said she panicked and over-corrected, losing control.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher was riding in a Cosco Explorer booster, which his
mother had strapped into the third-row bench seat of the minivan.
Armstrong remembers pressing with her knee on the booster seat to
make sure the lap belt holding it in was as snug as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "Christopher was thrown from the van," said his mother. "My two
other sons were also with me, and they were fine."</TE>
<TE>   Joseph and Jacob were riding in the minivan's second row of seats.
Four-year-old Jacob, in an adult lap and shoulder belt, had a bump on
his head, said his mother. Joseph, 15 months old, in a child seat
with shoulder straps, "had no injury whatsoever," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The only person I can blame for the accident is myself," said
Armstrong. The family filed a lawsuit against Cosco, which the
company settled. Armstrong went on to found Parents Against Cosco
Explorers, the group that is petitioning the company for a recall.</TE>
<TE>   "I still see the seats," said Armstrong. "Any time I'm in Wal-Mart
and I see people looking at them, I tell them not to buy them."</TE>
<TE>   That Christopher Armstrong and Patricia Fairfax died while their
siblings survived was not the consequence of their riding in Cosco
seats, said a company representative.</TE>
<TE>   "Every occupant of a vehicle in a crash actually experiences a
different incident," said Jonathan Reynolds, Cosco's general counsel.
"They have different forces acting in different ways ... because of
their position in the vehicle."</TE>
<TE>   But the Armstrongs' lawyer said the crash amounted to a real-world
test. "One child is ejected and the others are unharmed--I don't know
how much more you have to have before the government does something,"
said Brantley White.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1995 report using child-sized dummies, a Canadian safety
agency documented seven cases of ejection in 10 tests of shield
boosters. Three tests involved the Cosco Explorer, and the dummies
were totally or partly ejected in two of them.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the tests, Canada does not allow children under 40
pounds--or roughly under 4 years of age--to be placed in shield
boosters.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Armstrong weighed about 35 pounds, his mother said.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, federal rules allow shield boosters to be
used only for children who weigh between 30 and 40 pounds. For older
children, the shield should be removed and the base of the seat used
to position the child in the car's lap and shoulder belts.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. safety tests for child seats simulate a head-on crash, not a
rollover.</TE>
<TE>   Cosco attorney Reynolds said the rollover testing by Canadian
authorities "was not properly documented in several respects."</TE>
<TE>   Cosco has also released a letter from a Virginia consumer whose
5-year-old daughter survived a rollover crash unharmed in a Grand
Explorer seat.</TE>
<TE>   The American Academy of Pediatrics has sided with the Canadian
position.</TE>
<TE>   "Children who weigh 40 pounds or less are best protected in a seat
with a full harness," the doctors' group said in a recommendation
issued this March. "Significant injuries to the head, spine, abdomen
and extremities of children in shield boosters have been documented
in crash investigations. Although boosters with shields may meet
current federal motor vehicle safety standards, [the academy] does
not recommend their use."</TE>

<CX>   Child seats -- An article on Sept. 24 in Section A mistakenly
reported that Canadian safety officials prohibited auto booster seats
for children under 40 pounds as a result of crash tests. In fact, the

<HD>U.S. Readies Smallpox Attack Plan</HD>
<DH>Health: States get details on emergency mass inoculations,
but it is still unknown who would get doses ahead of the disease's
reappearance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Warning that even a single case of smallpox could be interpreted as
an attack on the nation, federal health officials on Monday sent
states detailed plans for emergency mass vaccinations against the
disease.</LD>
<LD>   Although smallpox was eradicated globally in the late 1970s,
rising concerns about its potential use in bioterrorism or biological
warfare have prompted federal officials to beef up the nation's
defenses. While the document sent to state and local health officials
lays out plans for vaccinating the entire U.S. population, the
federal government has not decided which Americans should be
inoculated in advance of any sign that the disease has reappeared.</LD>
<LD>   If a case of smallpox arose, officials at the national Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention said, one of the first jobs would be
to determine the cause. But given that the disease has not surfaced
in more than two decades, "we would act, at this point, as if ... the
nation were under attack and would immediately implement the response
plan," said Dr. David Fleming, deputy director for science and public
health at the CDC, which developed the plan.</LD>
<TE>   Public health officials would first vaccinate and monitor the sick
and anyone who had close contact with them after the onset of fever.
These vaccinations would be voluntary, said Dr. Walter Orenstein,
director of the CDC's National Immunization Program. But officials
"would have to work with people who refused vaccination" to ensure
that if they became ill they would not have contact with anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on circumstances, state and federal officials could then
authorize voluntary vaccinations for a broader set of people,
potentially including all 288 million Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The plan explains how a local clinic should deploy staff for
everything from medical exams to traffic flow to vaccinate 1 million
people in 10 days. But officials said the actual time to vaccinate
the public would depend on circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal would be to protect as many people as possible, with the
first part of the vaccination campaign being directed specifically at
those who were at highest risk," Fleming said.</TE>
<TE>   The vaccine can still provide protection even if given a few days
after a person is exposed. Officials assume that anyone at risk would
want to be vaccinated.</TE>
<TE>   The plan does not settle the question of whom to "prevaccinate."
The Bush administration is still debating the issue. An advisory
panel this summer recommended against mass vaccinations and instead
said that shots should be given to 15,000 emergency and health
workers, who would likely be first to see an infected person.</TE>
<TE>   The question of whom to inoculate in the absence of an explicit
threat is tricky. Smallpox is fatal in about 30% of cases, and the
disease can leave survivors with extensive scars. Most Americans are
thought to have no immunity. Routine vaccinations stopped in the
early 1970s. The smallpox vaccine is effective for up to 10 years
with the initial shot. With a booster, it is effective for at least
10 more years.</TE>
<TE>   But the shots come with health risks, including an estimated 1
death per 1 million vaccinations, according to studies conducted in
the 1960s. Because of the large number of people with compromised
immune systems today, including the elderly and those who are HIV
positive, a mass vaccine program could cause scores of fatalities.
The vaccine uses a live virus related to the smallpox virus.</TE>
<TE>   Public health officials have increasingly worried that hostile
nations are developing weapons using smallpox-like viruses, or else
have obtained some of the few remaining samples that have been kept
for research purposes and vaccine development. Russia and the U.S.
are known to house such samples.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy G. Thompson, secretary of the Department of Health and Human
Services, the CDC's parent agency, said last year that the government
would order enough vaccine to protect "every man, woman and child in
America."</TE>
<TE>   The government has more than 100 million doses of an old vaccine
and has been studying whether they would remain effective if diluted
and used to vaccinate a larger number of people. "If we were to see
smallpox tomorrow, we have access to vaccines that we feel could
support mass vaccination, if we had to on an emergency basis," said
Joseph Henderson, the CDC's associate director for bioterrorism
preparedness.</TE>
<TE>   Henderson added that some states had already submitted smallpox
response plans to the CDC for review, and that those states may hold
exercises to test their ability to carry out the plans.</TE>
<TE>   But many states are swamped as they try to prepare for a variety
of potential terrorist threats. "So they are very, very busy on many,
many fronts dealing with building the public health infrastructure to
respond," Henderson said.</TE>

<HD>We Need a Steady-- Not Heavy--Hand at the LAPD's Helm</HD>
<DH>Excessive-force issue is critical in evaluating candidates.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Earl Ofari Hutchinson is the author of "The Crisis in
Black and Black" (Middle Passage Press, 1998). E-mail: ehutchi344@aol

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Police Commission's three finalists for LAPD
chief--John Timoney, William Bratton and Art Lopez--are widely hailed
for raising officer morale, sharply reducing crime and boosting the
image of departments they've headed.</LD>
<LD>   Yet there are also troubling questions about what they did or
didn't do to reduce the overuse of excessive force by officers in
their departments.</LD>
<LD>   In Philadelphia, Timoney drew intense fire from black leaders and
political activists after the videotaped beating of a black suspect
by a swarm of officers and the manhandling of demonstrators at the
Republican convention in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   In New York, Bratton drew fire from black leaders and civil
libertarians for the big jump in excessive-force complaints that
stemmed from street stops and shakedowns of young black and Latino
men, many of whom were not arrested or even accused of any criminal
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   In Oxnard, Lopez drew fire from black and Latino leaders after the
questionable shootings by police of five civilians, some of whom were
mentally ill.</TE>
<TE>   How a police chief handles excessive force by officers strikes at
the heart of real police reform. A decade ago in Los Angeles, the
Christopher Commission investigating the Rodney King beating case
recognized that excessive force was the single biggest problem that
poisoned relations between the police and minority communities and
was a spark in the deadly racial turmoil.</TE>
<TE>   The panel identified hundreds of officers who were the targets of
citizen complaints of excessive force or the use of improper tactics
in dealing with suspects. Even more damaging, the commission named
dozens of officers who had multiple charges of excessive force
against them.</TE>
<TE>   It tactfully labeled them "potential problem officers."</TE>
<TE>   The commission blasted the department for doing nothing to control
or discipline the officers and for not holding their supervisors
accountable for their actions. It recommended firmer discipline
procedures to weed out problem officers and better screening
procedures to prevent troublesome applicants from ever wearing an
LAPD uniform.</TE>
<TE>   That didn't happen.</TE>
<TE>   A decade after the Christopher report, the city was stunned again
by allegations that some officers in the Rampart Division beat,
kicked and shot suspects, planted evidence and gave perjured
testimony and that supervisors did little or nothing to punish them.</TE>
<TE>   Further, it took years and much pressure from the Police
Commission and the Justice Department to get the LAPD to drop its
resistance to a computerized monitoring system to better track
civilian complaints against officers, mostly involving
excessive-force violations.</TE>
<TE>   Without ironclad procedures to swiftly and severely discipline
abusive officers, it is impossible to fully restore public confidence
in the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   What it still comes down to is that the punishment of officer
misconduct rests in the hands of the chief. And there is nothing that
can be done to compel him to take action against an abusive officer.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, city officials have absolved themselves of any
responsibility for officers who brutalize suspects by giving the LAPD
free rein to investigate itself. This blind faith in the department
to initiate wide-ranging reforms is fraught with pitfalls.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Department is no different from any other
government agency or corporation accused of wrongdoing. Its reflexive
reaction is self-protective. The officers who use excessive force and
are not punished are not just a danger to the department but to the
community, feeding the belief of much of the public that officials
cover up officer misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James Hahn and the L.A. City Council would be well-advised
to think long and hard about what a police chief can and should do to
reduce or eliminate the use of excessive force as a flashpoint issue
in police-minority community relations. This is a crucial litmus test
they must not ignore in picking the next chief.</TE>

<HD>War Talk Provides Cover Fire</HD>
<DH>Focus on Iraq draws attention from the economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration dominates the news every time it says
anything about its prospective war with Iraq. As an example, the
"strategy" document released Friday, calling for preemptive action
against terror, was mostly a rehash of the president's speech of June
1. And yet discussion of its particulars dominated the weekend, as
other news was mostly buried.</LD>
<LD>   And maybe that's the real brilliance of the Bushies--changing the
subject away from the economy, stupid.</LD>
<LD>   Consider: The Dow Jones industrial average fell below 8,000 last
week and closed Monday at 7,872.  Just Sunday, Peregrine Systems, a
San Diego-based software company, filed for bankruptcy. As an example
of the cratering in high tech, Peregrine sold off a subsidiary unit
for $350 million after having paid $1 billion for that same unit in
August 2001. Speaking of lost billions, WorldCom revealed last week
that it probably misreported $9 billion in revenue, not $7 billion.
Meanwhile, leading economic indicators and housing starts have fallen
for three months in a row. Finally, oil prices went above $30 a
barrel Monday, up 40% since the start of the year.</LD>
<TE>   If this news seems secondary, maybe there's a reason for that. But
not a good reason, according to Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.). The
octogenarian legislator offered his own explanation on the Senate
floor Friday: "The president was dropping in the polls and the
domestic situation was such that the administration was appearing to
be much like the emperor who had no clothes." Speaking in his usual
flowery prose, Byrd described the coming of "the war fervor, the
drums of war, the bugles of war, the clouds of war."</TE>
<TE>   Was there a sudden surge of war threat to match the surge of war
talk? Not in Byrd's view: "I sat in on some of the secret briefings,
and nobody from the administration has been able to answer the
question: Why now?" And yet even if the military threat of Iraq has
been hazy, the political impact of eclipsing the economy has been
quite clear. "What has that done to the president's polls?" Byrd
asked, and then answered: "Seventy percent."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Byrd is too cynical. But economic concerns may yet punch
through. That's the message of an article in the Sept. 23 issue of
Barron's, the Wall Street-oriented weekly, which speculated on the
cost of war, describing four economic scenarios: "the good, the bad,
the ugly and the horrible."</TE>
<TE>   The good scenario estimates war outlays at $200 billion. That's
more red ink atop a deficit already projected to be more than $300
billion in both fiscal years 2002 and 2003. The other scenarios--bad,
ugly, horrible--revolve mostly around recession-producing oil price
and interest rate spikes, spikes that could become new, higher
plateaus. So maybe the Bush administration is wise to keep shifting
discussion from the home front to the war front.</TE>
<TE>   In a story placed prominently in Monday's Financial Times,
National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice pledged that the U.S. will
be "completely devoted" to the democratic reconstruction of Iraq.
That sounds nice to foreign-policy wonks--although such
"nation-building" has yet to be budgeted.</TE>
<TE>   But the Rice story succeeded in at least one mission. It was more
visible than another story in that paper, a piece that normally might
generate chills among economy-minded Americans: Foreign investment
into the U.S. fell from $301 billion in 2000 to $125 billion in 2001.
Even more ominously, a worldwide corporate survey showed that China,
not the U.S., is the most attractive country for future investment.</TE>
<TE>   But is it really a surprise that capital markets are shying away
from a nation that's preoccupied with starting a foreign war?</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, if American military action produces a safer world,
the "investment" in fighting will be worthwhile. But, as Byrd said,
there's been no sudden development in Iraq. Indeed, the developments
seem to be everywhere but Iraq. As House Intelligence Committee
Chairman Porter J. Goss (R-Fla.) said over the weekend, 70,000
anti-American terrorists are loose in the world, their numbers
increasing by 2,000 every month. How will a U.S. occupation of
Baghdad affect those baddies and their bad plans?</TE>
<TE>   Bush believes, rightly, that defense trumps dollars. But if he
miscalculates national security, he will also fail at economic
security.</TE>
<TE>   And then the nation will be less safe, not to mention less
prosperous. And eventually, Americans will notice.</TE>

<HD>The Tide Has Turned Against Large Commercial Fishing Fleets</HD>
<DH>Dwindling stock means cutting the number of boats.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL L. WEBER</AU>
<BD>Michael L. Weber's most recent book is "From Abundance
to Scarcity: A History of U.S. Marine Fisheries Policy" (Island
Press, 2001).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The federal government is on the verge of closing most waters off the
West Coast to many kinds of fishing for decades--and not a moment too
soon. People are still sorting through the economic and social
effects of the decision by the federal Pacific Fishery Management
Council to suspend fishing for several kinds of rockfish off the
Pacific Coast.</LD>
<LD>   With stunning suddenness, the myth of ocean abundance has
dissolved into the cold reality of scarcity. Where we once faced the
challenge of building up fishing fleets, we now face the challenge of
trimming them. If we do not succeed in reducing fleets to sizes that
diminishing fish populations can support, we will surely face more
closures and economic dislocation.</LD>
<LD>   No one who depended on, managed, enjoyed or profited from these
fisheries should be surprised. The signs were clear five years ago.
Then, tighter and tighter fishing restrictions aimed at protecting
declining rockfish populations reduced the economic value of the West
Coast commercial fishery from $100 million in 1997 to $50 million in
1998.</LD>
<TE>   In January 2000, the Commerce secretary declared the fishery a
disaster, but Congress provided little relief. Two years ago, the
Pacific Fishery Management Council called for halving the West Coast
fleet that has fished for groundfish, which consumers purchase as red
snapper.</TE>
<TE>   What a shift. In the 1970s and 1980s, government agencies,
investors and fishermen dreamed confidently of expanding fisheries,
not just on the Pacific Coast but elsewhere off U.S. coasts and
beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Investment tax laws, government loan guarantees, the expulsion of
foreign fishing fleets and wildly optimistic estimates of potential
catches fed an enormous boom in fishing boat construction. More than
half of the 30,500 vessels built between 1950 and 2000 were built
from 1973 to 1984.</TE>
<TE>   It was too much of a good thing. Soon, many fishermen found their
grounds crowded and their catches declining. To make ends meet, some
rushed to increase catches by using more gear and bigger vessels and
by fishing longer.</TE>
<TE>   This race for the fish magnified small problems, such as damage to
sensitive habitats and the discard of fish that were too small or the
wrong species to sell. Quite often, catches declined, sometimes
precipitously.</TE>
<TE>   Many fishermen began seeking better grounds.</TE>
<TE>   From 1984 to 1990, more than 2,000 shrimp trawlers left the
crowded shrimping grounds of the Gulf of Mexico. But they did not
disappear. Rather, they simply moved to other fisheries. Fishermen
elsewhere sometimes took advantage of "fire sale" vessel prices to
gear up. In the end, hundreds of shrimp trawlers entered other
fisheries, many of which already were suffering, or soon would be,
from too many boats chasing too few fish. These patterns will repeat
themselves on the West Coast unless dramatic steps are taken to
reduce fleet size.</TE>
<TE>   In several regions, the federal government has underwritten
programs to buy and scuttle fishing vessels. In Alaska, the
government and the industry financed the scuttling of nine large
trawlers in the Alaska pollock fishery, to the relief of nearly
everyone. Unfortunately, these are isolated examples and wholly
inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   The United States desperately needs a national effort to reduce
fleets. Buyback programs should be designed carefully and are by no
means a panacea. But whether vessel buyback programs or market-based
approaches are the means, Washington must lead by investing in
cutting fleets, just as it did in building them up.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, fishermen who have benefited from federal programs and
will benefit from restored fisheries should contribute to readjusting
the fleet size to meet more realistic expectations of the ocean's
productivity by helping to finance the fleet reduction.</TE>
<TE>   Fishing regulations to protect marine wildlife and habitats are no
match for the overcapacity of our fleets and the economic obligation
represented by the investment in vessels. Reducing fishing fleets is
key to the economic health of our fisheries and to the ecological
richness of our coastal waters.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Needs to Act Quickly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's too early to give up on efforts to make Iraq comply with weapons
inspections. But as Saddam Hussein once again--predictably--plays his
cynical games, the United Nations needs to lay down tough resolutions
and timetables or lose all credibility by watching helplessly as the
Bush administration prepares for war.</LD>
<LD>   When President Bush appeared before the U.N. on Sept. 12, he
energized the delegates with his demand that the organization crack
down on Iraq or face becoming a second League of Nations, which lost
respect and eventually ceased to exist over its failure to stop
Italy's fascist militarism. Bush put the U.N. in the driver's
seat--temporarily. He reminded his audience of a decade of U.N.
resolutions that Hussein has flouted as well as the Iraqi leader's
violations of international law, including an assassination plot
against the first President Bush and the use of weapons of mass
destruction on his own people.</LD>
<LD>   The message was clear: Enough is enough. Either the U.N. stops
Hussein or the U.S. will. That message was bolstered by the
resolution that Bush sent to Congress on Thursday asking for
open-ended authority to battle terrorist threats abroad.</LD>
<TE>   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was elated when he announced
last week that Iraq would readmit weapons inspectors. Oops. Turns out
that Iraq says it won't abide by any new U.N. resolution permitting
monitors to enter key presidential compounds, which, of course, are
some of the sites that may contain the worst of Iraq's weapons. The
truth is that Iraq has turned any weapons inspections into an
exercise in futility. Hussein apparently thinks he can go back to his
old tricks--promise one thing one day, another the next. Once the
inspectors arrive, he blocks their efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Annan was absolutely right to warn the Iraqis on Monday "not to
hedge on their acceptance" of weapons inspections or any new Security
Council resolutions. Now the U.N. Security Council needs to reach a
quick resolution that leaves Hussein no outs.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is right to insist that the Security
Council approve a resolution that carries the threat of force if Iraq
does not comply with full and open inspections. If necessary, the
administration might have to go along with two resolutions--one
outlining demands, the second the use of force. But any second
resolution should have a timetable attached. Otherwise, Baghdad will
simply stall.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush didn't listen to the hawks in his administration
who wanted to do an end run around the U.N. If the U.N. wants to
remain relevant, it needs to act. Now.</TE>

<HD>Don't Derail Yosemite Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Word is that the National Park Service is reassigning Yosemite
National Park's superintendent. The reported move could be routine,
or it could be a tactic to further stall efforts to revitalize the
crowded, smog-choked natural wonder. The public will need to make
sure the new guy doesn't try to change course.</LD>
<LD>   David Mihalic can be a gruff man, and he has irritated some
powerful people during his three-year tenure as superintendent, in
part by doing an outstanding job of advancing a long-delayed plan to
reduce congestion in the valley and undo some of the changes that
have undermined the 1-by-7-mile granite cathedral's natural beauty.</LD>
<LD>   After more than 25 years of planning, debate and backsliding, the
park service finally has begun work on several parts of the Yosemite
Valley Plan--the rehabilitation of the Lower Yosemite Falls area,
expansion of a walk-in campground, the removal of Cascade Dam on the
Merced River and the relocation of two large campgrounds.</LD>
<TE>   Even more important are future projects to restore meadows and get
many people out of their cars and onto buses for their visits to the
valley. This should help clear up the pall of smog that often shrouds
El Capitan and let bird song replace traffic noise.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who have crossed swords with Mihalic over the plan is
Rep. George P. Radanovich (R-Mariposa), whose district includes the
valley and who is chairman of the national parks subcommittee of the
House Resources Committee. Radanovich has opposed the reduction of
campsites in the valley and doesn't think that motorists--day
visitors, for instance--should have to park in lots outside the
valley and ride in on buses. On these points, the congressman is
allied with tourist-business owners on the periphery of Yosemite who
fear the plan will discourage visitors and hurt their businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Mihalic's successor apparently will be Mike Tollefson, now the
superintendent of Great Smoky Mountains National Park and formerly
the chief of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks in California.
Supporters of the plan worry that Tollefson might be less aggressive
in moving the plan forward, particularly with Radanovich looking over
his shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has a disturbing record of rolling back
environmental progress. This must not be allowed to happen in
Yosemite.</TE>
<TE>   The people overseeing the park need to know that the public loves
Yosemite for its unmatched natural beauty, not for the embellishments
that have edged in over the years.</TE>
<TE>   And it's time Radanovich realizes that the more the valley looks
like the place that made John Muir rhapsodize, the more people it
will attract and the more money they'll spend at those motels, stores
and restaurants in towns like Mariposa as they bus, hike or bike in
and out of the park.</TE>

<HD>Ban on Banners a Good Sign</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a boneheaded move, the California Department of Transportation
this month announced that, to comply with a federal judge's ruling,
it had no choice but to turn the state's 12,000 bridges and freeway
overpasses into so many concrete soapboxes, billboards and personal
message boards.</LD>
<LD>   Caltrans got itself into this mess last fall when it let stand a
banner supporting New York terror victims. A 1953 state law permits
residents to affix the American flag and California's state flag to
freeway bridges--but nothing else--as long as flags are securely
fastened and don't endanger motorists. So when someone hung the 9/11
banner on an overpass in the Northern California community of Scotts
Valley, Caltrans workers should have untied it. Understandably, they
didn't.</LD>
<LD>   Not long after that, two Santa Cruz women hung their own poster
questioning America's bombing of Afghanistan from the same overpass.
A police officer promptly removed it but let the 9/11 sympathy sign
stand.</LD>
<TE>   Naturally, court was the next stop. There the two women argued,
quite sensibly, that when flags and some political signs stay up
while workers rip others down, the state is infringing Californians'
free speech rights. The trial judge agreed and ordered Caltrans to
come up with a consistent policy allowing all flags and banners or
nothing at all. Since state law already allowed flags, agency
officials decided they had no choice but to permit pretty much
everything else that wasn't obscene or derogatory, so long as it
wasn't in danger of falling onto the whizzing cars below.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine the tsunami of signs poised to crash upon motorists: "Earn
$$$ at home," "Sexy Women Waiting to Talk to You at 1-800 ... " or
"Lauren, Will You Marry Me?"</TE>
<TE>   Overnight, the 6,000 men and women at Caltrans responsible for
highway maintenance became the decency brigade--not to mention
referees between different individuals and interest groups intent on
getting prominent display for their message or cause.</TE>
<TE>   The result was predictably chaotic. In one of several reported
incidents last weekend, advocates for medical marijuana scaled a
100-foot-high section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and
hung their banner, which someone else quickly removed. It was pure
luck that no one plummeted onto the roadway--just the sort of
distraction a driver who's putting on makeup with a mouth full of
fast food and fingers on the cell phone and radio dial needs.</TE>
<TE>   By Monday, someone at the agency had come to his or her senses.
They came up with a new interim policy: no flags, no banners.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans has an October date before the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals. It wants to go back to the flag-only rule. But we hope the
court recognizes that this is not a 1st Amendment issue and that
there's no good reason to allow California's freeways and bridges to
be cluttered with ads, political statements or even the Stars and
Stripes.</TE>

<HD>Stalemate Deepens at Arafat's Headquarters</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Israel insists to the Palestinian leader that he
must surrender suspected terrorists holed up with him. He flatly
refuses to comply.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>With Israeli tanks and jackhammers silent, a quieter siege set in
Monday at Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's ruined headquarters, now
ringed by rubble and thick coils of barbed wire. An armed assault
turned into a paper war, with Israelis and Palestinians arguing over
lists, or the lack of them, of suspected terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   The two sides held their first face-to-face meeting since Israel
surrounded Arafat's executive compound, known as the Muqata, and
destroyed all but the one building now housing the Palestinian
Authority president and about 250 aides, guards and other workers. No
progress was reported in that meeting, nor in a series of meetings
and phone calls involving Terje Roed-Larsen, the United Nations
special envoy to the Mideast.</LD>
<LD>   "We could be here for weeks," said a diplomatic source close to
the talks.</LD>
<TE>   He added that the U.N. envoy was growing concerned about living
conditions in the compound, whose occupants are crowded together in a
few rooms, with periodic water shortages, a lack of air conditioning
and a severe shortage of toilet facilities. The Israeli military has
sent in food and underwear, among other supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, despite a U.S. abstention, the U.N. Security Council
approved a compromise resolution on the Middle East demanding that
Israel cease its actions around Arafat's compound while condemning
terrorist attacks. The resolution was negotiated by the European
Union and was based on competing proposals from the Palestinians and
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy U.S. Ambassador James Cunningham said the resolution was
"flawed in our view in that it failed to explicitly condemn the
terrorist organizations and those who provide them with political
cover."</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian draft resolution blamed Israel for an upsurge in
violence over the last two years. U.S. Ambassador John D. Negroponte
countered with a proposal that called for the Palestinians to halt
suicide bombings but also demanded that Israel stop its siege of
Arafat's headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Senior U.S. officials called Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
to express President Bush's concern about Israel's weekend actions in
Ramallah, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said en route to
Trenton, N.J., with Bush for a political fund-raiser.</TE>
<TE>   "The president views what Israel is doing now as unhelpful to the
cause of bringing about reform in Palestinian institutions," he said.
In a separate incursion, Israeli tanks, bulldozers and helicopter
gunships moved into two neighborhoods of Gaza City today. Nine
Palestinians were killed in the assault, including several militants
associated with Hamas and the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade. The Israeli
army said troops destroyed 13 workshops allegedly used to make
weapons, as well as the home of a militant, Mohammed Farhat, who was
suspected of taking part in a March attack that killed five Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   In the Ramallah assault, Israel moved against the Muqata on
Thursday, hours after a suicide bomber killed five civilians on a bus
in Tel Aviv in the latest of many such attacks carried out by
Palestinian militants in the last two years. Another victim of that
attack died later.</TE>
<TE>   The Sharon government initially said that the assault on the
Muqata was intended to isolate Arafat, but it later began demanding
that the Palestinians turn over 19 men, said to be among those
trapped inside the compound, who it said are wanted for
terror-related crimes.</TE>
<TE>   First, the Palestinians complained that they had been given no
list of names. Israeli officials said none was needed. "Everybody
knows who these people are," Sharon spokesman Raanan Gissin said.</TE>
<TE>   Then the number of suspects ballooned to 50, according to a senior
Israeli military officer who is commanding the operation at Arafat's
headquarters. The officer said the number rose after interrogation of
other Palestinians who abandoned the headquarters complex in the
first hours of the siege.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat said he had no intention of turning anyone in. The Israelis
countered by asking for a list of everyone in the compound--a request
the Palestinians dismissed as a fishing expedition.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis have publicly named only four people who are accused
of terrorism and assumed to be in the compound. Chief among them is
Tawfiq Tirawi, the Palestinian head of intelligence in the West Bank,
who, according to the Israel Defense Forces, operated a terrorist
cell of Arafat's Fatah movement in the West Bank and transferred
money and weapons to support terrorist activity.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli radio reported Monday that Israeli officials had rejected
a Palestinian proposal to transfer the wanted men to Palestinian-run
jails in Jericho and the Gaza Strip. Sharon, speaking in Tel Aviv,
said he was determined that the suspects be handed over to Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Some Israelis have questioned why Sharon would punish Arafat for
the suicide bombings without going after the leaders of Hamas, the
militant organization that has claimed responsibility for last week's
attack in Tel Aviv and many others. Hamas' spiritual leader, Sheik
Ahmed Yassin, has recently been seen on television from his base in
the Gaza Strip, commenting on the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's answer: Hamas may be next. "We haven't finished our work
in the Gaza Strip," the prime minister said. "And when the day comes
when we gather our forces, we will work to strike Hamas and to
deprive it of its capabilities."</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear whether the attack today in Gaza was part of this
strategy. The Israeli army said its troops pulled back this morning
after accomplishing their goals.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has also been criticized for raising Arafat's profile and
causing Palestinians to rally around him.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of letting Arafat naturally lose his place in
history--something which he has done pretty well on his own--we, over
the recent months, have turned him into a martyr, reuniting the
Palestinian people around him," said Industry and Trade Minister
Dalia Itzik. "I don't see the logic in this."</TE>
<TE>   In another incident Monday, one Israeli was killed and three
wounded when a Palestinian gunman opened fire on Jews visiting the
Cave of the Patriarchs, which Jews and Muslims revere as the burial
site of Abraham, Sarah and other biblical figures.</TE>

<HD>100 Still Missing in Russian Avalanche</HD>

<DL>VLADIKAVKAZ, Russia</DL>
<LD>One man reported missing after a devastating avalanche in southern
Russia was found unharmed Monday, but more than 100 people remained
lost and authorities feared that the number could rise.</LD>
<LD>   Two bodies were recovered Monday in the immediate vicinity of the
avalanche, bringing the number of those found to eight, a duty
officer at the headquarters for the rescue effort said. Emergency
officials have said they feared that as many as 150 people were
killed in Friday's avalanche.</LD>
<LD>   "I haven't lost hope, but when I saw from a helicopter what had
happened, the conclusions are not comforting," said Lev Dzugayev, the
top aide to the president of North Ossetia, a small republic in the
mountains near the Georgian border where the disaster occurred.</LD>
<TE>   The avalanche happened when a chunk of glacier about 500 feet high
broke off from beneath a mountain peak and roared down two gorges at
more than 62 mph, uprooting trees and accumulating mud and rocks as
it went.</TE>
<TE>   According to a list compiled from relatives, 113 people were still
missing Monday, said Alan Doyev, a press spokesman for the Interior
Ministry of North Ossetia. The list could grow, Doyev said, as
information comes in on shepherds and watchmen at remote tourist
camps high in the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   One watchman was found unharmed near the mineral lode where he
works, said Boris Dzgoyev, head of North Ossetia's Emergency
Situations Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, rescue workers trudged up steep banks of grime, past
tree trunks ripped out of the ground by the force of the avalanche,
and hacked away at truck-sized lumps of ice with hand tools.</TE>
<TE>   An official said the fallen ice was melting. In the flooded
village of Gornaya Saniba, only the rooftops and chimneys of houses
were visible.</TE>
<TE>   A team of experts was in the region to try to discover the cause
of the disaster, which an Interior Ministry spokesman said might be
connected to global warming.</TE>

<LD>Fearing new attacks, Pakistani police removed signs identifying
churches set up in private homes and fortified other Christian sites
with sandbag bunkers.</LD>
<LD>   The measures came after police found weapons, explosives and maps
of two churches and a Christian school--all in the southern city of
Karachi--during the arrest of two suspected Islamic militants,
Interior Ministry officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Some Christian officials suggested that the removal of the signs
was really designed to lower the visibility of non-Muslims. "The
authorities just want to hide the worship places of Christians," said
Shahbaz Bhatti of the All-Pakistan Minorities Alliance.</LD>

<LD>Mexico's Foreign Ministry said Ricardo Pascoe would step down as
ambassador to Cuba on Monday after he was recalled to face a probe
over alleged corruption.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this month, the ministry said an audit of the Havana
embassy found $87,000 worth of fraud that stemmed from skimming cash
meant for social functions, authorizing duplicate services and paying
for "irregular services." It said Pascoe was responsible for the
money.</LD>

<LD>U.S. forces conducting searches in eastern Afghanistan found grenades
and automatic rifles hidden by women, including some weapons
concealed under body-shrouding burkas, said Lt. Col. Carla Sylvester,
a military spokeswoman.</LD>
<LD>   The searches near the towns of Khowst and Deh Rawood turned up
AK-47s, a grenade launcher, grenades, ammunition, computers,
passports and propaganda related to Osama bin Laden, she said.</LD>
<LD>   Many Afghans have complained that U.S. troops' insistence on
searching women is humiliating and unnecessary. Sylvester said that
when Afghan women are searched, it is always by female soldiers or by
Afghans.</LD>

<DH>Germany: Reelected chancellor tempers rhetoric against an
attack on Iraq and removes an official who offended Bush.</DH>

<AU>JEFFREY FLEISHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Fresh from the narrowest election victory in Germany's postwar
history, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder moved Monday to start repairing
relations with the U.S. by accepting the resignation of his justice
minister, who last week was quoted as saying President Bush's talk of
war echoed that of Adolf Hitler.</LD>
<LD>   Schroeder's reelection may have been largely propelled by his
refusal to commit German troops to a U.S.-led war with Iraq.
Washington was outraged at defiance from one of its closest allies.
The atmosphere was further spoiled when Justice Minister Herta
Daeubler-Gmelin was quoted as saying that, like Hitler, Bush is using
war rhetoric to distract voters from domestic economic issues.</LD>
<LD>   Schroeder's decision to accept Daeubler-Gmelin's resignation was
his first move after Sunday's election to soothe tensions. Although
Schroeder reiterated that German troops would not participate in
ousting Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, his tone was less
confrontational.</LD>
<TE>   Some government officials and political analysts predict that
Germany might end up indirectly providing support for a war in Iraq
by accepting expanded peacekeeping responsibilities in the Balkans
and Afghanistan. This would free American and other Western forces
for duties in the Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   "We have nothing to change from what we said before the election,"
Schroeder said Monday. "Between friends there can be factual
differences, but they should not be personalized, particularly
between close allies."</TE>
<TE>   The chancellor's softer language followed weeks in which
U.S.-German relations were at their lowest level in decades. U.S.
National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice said recently that the
atmosphere between the countries had been "poisoned." Secretary of
Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld signaled Monday that he had no interest in
meeting with his German counterpart, Peter Struck, at a North
Atlantic Treaty Organization gathering in Poland.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials' reactions to Schroeder's victory indicated that
animosities remained sharp.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no comment on the German election's outcome, but I would
have to say that the way it was conducted was notably unhelpful and,
as the White House has indicated, has had the effect of poisoning the
relationship," Rumsfeld told reporters after meeting with Polish
President Aleksander Kwasniewski.</TE>
<TE>   A senior White House official traveling with Bush in New Jersey on
Monday indicated that the president did not call Schroeder to
congratulate the chancellor on his reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Karsten Voigt, an analyst of U.S.-German relations for the German
Foreign Ministry, said he couldn't tell yet how relations between the
two allies might be improved. "But Herta Daeubler-Gmelin not joining
the new government is one symbol" that things could start getting
better, he said. Daeubler-Gmelin said she was misquoted.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder, whose coalition won a slim majority in Parliament,
understands the reluctance of Germans to send troops into battle.
This pacifism, an element of foreign policy since the end of World
War II, is becoming increasingly difficult to adhere to as Germany
takes a bigger role in international affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts believe that Schroeder's defiance of the U.S. over
Iraq has also hurt the nation among its European partners.</TE>
<TE>   "Germany is isolated in Europe now," said Carlo Masala, a
political scientist at the University of Cologne. "This is a real
danger for Schroeder. I think we will see a major shift in his
rhetoric and actions.... I think Germany will also lose certain
access to Washington. Even France is seen as more of an ally than
Germany these days. This damage will last a while, maybe throughout
the rest of Bush's presidency."</TE>
<TE>   Many Germans believe that the U.S. is strong-arming the rest of
the world into moving toward an invasion of Iraq. Schroeder and most
of the German electorate view this as a misguided use of force that
could ignite the Middle East and muddy the war on terrorism. Germans,
like most Europeans, would find a conflict with Iraq a bit more
palatable if it was conducted under a U.N. mandate.</TE>
<TE>   "It will make things easier if we have a U.N. resolution," Voigt
said. "Germany, of course, would never send troops, but maybe it
would participate in some way.... It's more about how Germany
positions itself. We have to make it clear that the problem is Saddam
Hussein and we just disagree on the method."</TE>
<TE>   Even some of Schroeder's Social Democratic supporters are troubled
that the shrill tenor of the debate over Iraq has aroused a once
silent anti-Americanism and may have significantly altered the
U.S.-German friendship.</TE>
<TE>   "The big mistake was with Daeubler-Gmelin's comment on Bush and
Hitler," said Steffen Reiche, a Social Democrat and government
minister in the state of Brandenburg. "Maybe the U.S.-German
relationship has been damaged. But maybe we can repair it. We are
friends of the Americans. We know what the Americans did for us."</TE>
<TE>   Some political analysts say Joschka Fischer, Germany's foreign
minister and a leader of the Greens party--Schroeder's coalition
partner--could help bridge the gap.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer is dynamic and well-liked. At great political risk, he and
Schroeder dispatched German troops to Kosovo in 1999 and Afghanistan
last year. He has mostly stayed out of the fray between Schroeder and
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Fischer kept a low profile on the Iraq issue," said Masala. "If
there is a person who has the ability to cool things down, it's
Fischer, not Schroeder."</TE>

<HD>GM Rolls Out Joint Venture With Russia</HD>
<DH>Manufacturing: Factory to produce low-cost SUV opens two
months after Ford starts up plant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Look under the hood of a Russian-made car, and increasingly you'll
find American technology. General Motors Corp. on Monday became the
second U.S. car maker in two months to launch production in Russia
after a big investment in the country's automotive industry.</LD>
<LD>   GM Chairman John F. Smith Jr. was on hand in the southern city of
Togliatti to inaugurate the $340-million GM-Avtovaz joint venture to
produce a new sport utility vehicle known as the Chevrolet Niva.</LD>
<LD>   The $8,000 cost of the least expensive model is expected to be
lower than that of comparable four-wheel-drive vehicles. That,
together with the Chevy name, fueled optimism at the joint venture
that the Chevy Niva will be a success among buyers looking for a
tough car to negotiate Russia's rough, pothole-ridden roads.</LD>
<TE>   GM and Avtovaz built a factory from scratch capable of producing
75,000 Nivas a year by 2005. At first, it is to serve only the
Russian market, but plans call for the vehicle to be sold in Europe,
the Middle East, Asia and Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   GM put in 41.5% of the joint venture, or about $141 million. The
Russian partner put in another 41.5%, while 17% is held by the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</TE>
<TE>   The Nivas now rolling off the assembly line follow Ford Motor
Co.'s opening near St. Petersburg in July of its own fully owned auto
plant, which is making Ford Focus sedans and hatchbacks to be sold in
Russia for about $11,000.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said at the ceremony that the GM investment "reflects the
importance we place on being present in the Russian market--utilizing
local expertise and resources to tap the vast potential of this
important growth market."</TE>
<TE>   Management of the joint venture said it will help create 3,200
jobs in the Samara region of Russia--at the new plant, in contracted
services and among suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   Yevgeny Gavrilenkov, chief economist of the investment bankers
Troika Dialog, said the venture represents one of the largest foreign
investments so far in Russia's manufacturing sector and is important
because it might pave the way for others from the West.</TE>
<TE>   "This deal is very good for Avtovaz because it will provide a
badly needed push and incentive to improve the general quality level
of its production. Any contacts with foreign producers, as well as
competition with them, are very helpful for Russian auto producers,"
Gavrilenkov said.</TE>
<TE>   The recent injection of Western car-making technology, he said, is
the first in the country since the Italian auto maker Fiat helped
modernize the Soviet industry in the late 1960s and early 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   But Gavrilenkov said the deal could be seen as somewhat risky for
GM because Avtovaz "is not, by far, the most transparent company in
Russia." He noted that the company, which also makes the popular,
low-priced Zhiguli sedan, has been dogged by rumors and allegations
of corruption for a long time.</TE>
<TE>   Togliatti has been the scene of numerous mob-related killings,
including the slaying this year of a journalist investigating
corruption in the municipal government.</TE>

<HD>Kashmir Braces for Vote as Rebels Combat Soldiers</HD>
<DH>India: An election site is one of several battlegrounds on
eve of polling's second round.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SRINAGAR, India</DL>
<LD>Separatists launched grenade attacks on polling stations and fought
gun battles with soldiers Monday as the Indian-held part of Kashmir
geared up for another round of elections. Ten people were killed and
29 wounded.</LD>
<LD>   The violence came as tens of thousands of Indian soldiers built
sandbag bunkers at polling booths for a second bout of voting today
in India's portion of the Himalayan region, which is also claimed by
Pakistan.</LD>
<LD>   At least one police officer was killed when guerrillas attacked a
college in Srinagar. The campus was to be used as a distribution and
collection point for elections officials and security forces today.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, an Indian soldier and four rebels were killed during a
fierce gunfight near the highway connecting Srinagar and Jammu, the
summer and winter capitals of Jammu and Kashmir state, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, two guerrillas were killed in a gun battle in Rafiabad,
about 40 miles north of Srinagar, while a soldier and a civilian died
in a land mine explosion in Udhampur district. Police blamed the
blast on Islamic militants, who have been waging a 12-year insurgency
against Indian rule.</TE>
<TE>   The separatists have called for a boycott of the elections and
have threatened to kill candidates and voters. India is hoping the
vote, which is being staggered to help security forces, will
strengthen its rule and weaken the separatists.</TE>
<TE>   Voters in Jammu and Srinagar go to the polls today. At least
27,000 soldiers have been deployed to protect them in Srinagar alone.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 political activists and candidates, including a
state minister, have been killed in election-related violence this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the violence, election officials pressed ahead Monday with
last-minute checks of registration lists and security coordination.</TE>
<TE>   "We have tried our best. The rest is up to God," election officer
Gulam Jeelani Khan said.</TE>
<TE>   Turnout was unexpectedly high in the state's first round of
elections, held Sept. 16. The federal elections commission said 47.2%
of 800,000 registered voters in the affected areas cast their
ballots.</TE>

<HD>Marines to Start War Games Near Iraq-Kuwait Frontier</HD>
<DH>Military: In Pentagon's latest show of muscle in region,
1,000 troops are landing in gulf today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ABOARD THE USS MOUNT VERNON</DL>
<LD>A thousand combat Marines are going ashore in Kuwait today for a
long-planned desert warfare exercise that has taken on added
significance because of the standoff between the U.S. and Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The troops, from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit at Camp
Pendleton, will train with Kuwaiti soldiers in the flat, sandy
wasteland near the border with Iraq. The outskirts of Baghdad are
only about 300 miles away.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to move forward with the exercise is the Pentagon's
latest show of military muscle in the region. In recent weeks, the
U.S. military has been building on already significant levels of
troops and equipment it has positioned in the countries and seas
around Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   The permanent U.S. military presence in the region is in stark
contrast to its relative absence 12 years ago in the months leading
up to Operation Desert Storm. At that time--shortly after the end of
the Cold War--far more of the Pentagon's resources were still
deployed in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   But for much of the last decade, the Pentagon has based more than
20,000 American military personnel within close striking distance of
Iraq, along with heavy equipment for at least four armored brigades
and Patriot antimissile batteries to protect them.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, senior defense officials say elite special operations
troops this month began training alongside CIA units that could be
used in covert counter-terrorism operations within Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy has accelerated training and maintenance schedules for
many of its ships, including three aircraft carrier battle groups
based on the West Coast, so they could be ordered to steam toward the
Persian Gulf on short notice, a senior Navy official said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Troops in Kuwait</TE>
<TE>   Several thousand heavily armed Army soldiers also are moving into
Kuwait as part of regularly scheduled exercises or troop
replacements, while about 600 military planners from the U.S. Central
Command, based in Tampa, Fla., are now training in Qatar.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon says the planners have deployed to the Persian Gulf
to test the command's ability to set up a headquarters in a crisis.
But senior Pentagon officials say the planners could remain in Qatar
to establish a new forward headquarters in the region at Al Udeid Air
Base outside Doha, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force is also taking steps to prepare for a war,
augmenting the more than 200 warplanes already based in the region to
enforce the "no-fly" zones over southern and northern Iraq. The
Pentagon disclosed recently that it had asked Britain for permission
to base B-2 stealth bombers at its air base on the island of Diego
Garcia in the Indian Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials also say they have switched strategies to defend
pilots enforcing the no-fly zones. Instead of going after guns and
radar that could be used to target U.S. or British pilots, they are
aiming at command and communications links, a strategy that might be
more damaging to Iraq's ability to fight off an invasion.</TE>
<TE>   Senior officials say the arrival of fresh units in the region is
not in itself unusual. The exercises have been in the works for
years. But the officials acknowledge that by ordering other units to
stay put rather than rotate out, the military could easily enhance
the sizable U.S. force that has remained in place since the 1991 war
with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Along with this buildup, the latest air, land and sea exercise,
called Eager Mace, shows how U.S. military planning has changed.</TE>
<TE>   Marines now routinely train in Kuwait, learning to cope with the
region's blistering heat, the sometimes disorienting lack of
geographic landmarks, and the powdery, blowing sand that can foul
engines and bog down infantry troops. If the Marines are ordered to
be part of a strike against Iraq, the territory will be familiar.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here to demonstrate our readiness to go wherever we're
needed to go," said Capt. Seth Folsom, commander of a motorized
infantry unit.</TE>
<TE>   The 1,000 Marines from the warships Mount Vernon and Denver will
conduct day and night exercises, including firing live rounds from
weaponry ranging from M-16 rifles to howitzers.</TE>
<TE>   At the Marines' desert training facility at Twentynine Palms in
California, use of live rounds is restricted for environmental and
safety reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Training in Kuwait will emphasize use of night-vision equipment
and thermal-imaging technology meant to give Marines a tactical
advantage. Training with the Kuwaitis might give Marines tips on how
to beat the desert heat.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been in the desert a lot longer than we have," said Cpl.
Leif Paul. "I'm sure they have their own ways of desert survival."</TE>
<TE>   The Marines will train close to the Army facility in Kuwait, known
as Camp Doha, which now houses several thousand soldiers, heavy
equipment for a brigade, a Patriot antimissile system and several
dozen aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The Army plans its own exercise later this year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trained for Speed</TE>
<TE>   The Marines would add speed to any force sent into Iraq. Folsom,
for example, does not allow his Marines to sleep in tents, lest time
be lost disassembling them if an order to move is issued.</TE>
<TE>   "I want my Marines sleeping under the stars," said Folsom. "We
train to be the kind of unit that can move at a moment's notice."</TE>
<TE>   Despite conventional military doctrine that regards expeditionary
units as effective only a few hundred miles from their supply ships,
the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit, also from Camp Pendleton,
functioned effectively deep inside Afghanistan in November and
December.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech at Camp Pendleton in late August, Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld appeared to indicate that Marines will play a key
role if there is an attack on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   James Mattis, who led Marines in Afghanistan, has been promoted to
major general. Michael Hagee, who oversaw all expeditionary forces
from Camp Pendleton, has been promoted to general and nominated by
Rumsfeld to be commandant of the Marine Corps.</TE>
<TE>   Mattis went to Afghanistan after leading Marines in an exercise in
Egypt that, like Eager Mace, had been scheduled long in advance.</TE>
<TE>   The 1,000 Marines participating in Eager Mace are less than half
of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit's strength.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 1,200 Marines are aboard the Belleau Wood. The three
ships, all based in San Diego, constitute an amphibious ready group.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Corps declined to pinpoint the Belleau Wood's location,
saying only that it is in the gulf region.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Complications Over Iraq</TE>
<TE>   Although the Kuwaiti government welcomes the training exercise as
a way to continue the modernization of its military, the tension
between the U.S. and Iraq has caused some diplomatic complications.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Kuwait's official news agency quoted the foreign
minister as saying that his country would abide by any United Nations
resolution against Iraq but that it opposes unilateral action by the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   The comments came just a day after Army Gen. Tommy Franks, the
head of Central Command, visited Camp Doha and told reporters that
U.S. forces are prepared if President Bush gives the order to attack
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Marines boarded the Mount Vernon and Denver in Bahrain on Monday
morning after a three-day liberty in the capital, Manama, home to the
U.S. 5th Fleet. The journey to Kuwait City was scheduled to take
about 24 hours.</TE>

<HD>North Korea Taps a Chinese Capitalist</HD>
<DH>Economics: Tycoon will run nonsocialist region as
experiment in insular Communist nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>PYONGYANG, North Korea</DL>
<LD>North Korea has selected a Chinese tycoon to run its new experiment
in capitalism--a walled-off region designed to draw foreign
investment to the insular Communist nation.</LD>
<LD>   Yang Bin, 39, an orchid exporter and property developer named by
Forbes magazine as China's second-richest person, said Monday that
the 50-square-mile zone near the country's northwestern coast would
be free of the staunch ideology that has been North Korea's hallmark
for half a century.</LD>
<LD>   "The special zone is totally capitalist. It is separated from the
socialism," said Yang, speaking in Mandarin at a news conference in
Pyongyang, North Korea's capital.</LD>
<TE>   He said his appointment as chief executive of the Sinuiju Special
Administrative Region by North Korean leaders "shows their
willingness to be involved in the international community and
international politics."</TE>
<TE>   The presidium of North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly issued a
decree Sept. 12 setting up the region.</TE>
<TE>   The presidium pledged to keep its legal system unchanged for 50
years and allow its administration to issue passports and appoint the
chief prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   Sinuiju is the nation's main gateway to China--North Korea's last
major ally and trade partner. It has often been cited as a candidate
for a free-trade zone.</TE>
<TE>   Yang said the government intends to remove the zone's 200,000
residents and replace them over the next few years with 500,000 new
inhabitants with proven technical and administrative skills--North
Koreans from elsewhere as well as foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   He also said North Korea was committed to not interfering in
Sinuiju, which will use Chinese yuan or U.S. dollars as currency and
Korean, Chinese and English as official languages.</TE>
<TE>   He said a wall will separate the region from the rest of the
country. A major port also will be constructed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yang also said Pyongyang wants to recruit a legislative council of
15 people, half from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Europe--and the U.S.,
even though President Bush has dubbed North Korea part of an "axis of
evil."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MANILA</DL>
<LD>A Philippine governor said Monday that he has sent settlers and
officials to an island guarded by Philippine troops in the South
China Sea's disputed Spratlys archipelago to boost his country's
territorial claim to the area.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Joel Reyes of Palawan said about 90 Filipinos left the
province Sunday aboard a navy ship for Pag-asa island to try to build
a community there.</LD>
<LD>   His move could provoke protests from China and other countries
claiming some or of the Spratlys, a potentially oil-rich group of
islands, reefs and islets many fear could be a source of major
conflict.</LD>
<TE>   Reyes said he was aware of possible protests but would let defense
and foreign affairs officials deal with that. His constituents have
the right to start a life and exploit the resources there, he said.</TE>
<TE>   TV showed settlers boarding a navy ship for the 2 1/2-day sea
voyage carrying bamboo cages of chickens and pigs. One man struggled
to pull a goat aboard.</TE>
<TE>   Pag-asa has been occupied for years by Philippine troops and their
dependents. The island is so remote that soldiers posted there on
three-month shifts are given a "loneliness allowance."</TE>
<TE>   Philippine troops occupy eight islets in the Spratlys, which are
also claimed by Brunei, China, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam Some
claimants are discussing a code of conduct to prevent violence from
erupting in the region.</TE>

<HD>Cuba Trade Show Whets Appetites of U.S. Firms</HD>
<DH>Business: Mammoth food, agriculture event is called
symbolic of desire for better ties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Forty-three years after they fled the onslaught of revolution, U.S.
companies are streaming back to Cuba this week, to the consternation
of key people in the State Department.</LD>
<LD>   The occasion is a mammoth food and agricultural trade show, the
biggest U.S.-Cuban economic event since the 1950s. It is attracting
nearly 300 U.S. firms and tens of thousands of people, as well as two
buffalo calves from North Dakota and the Dancing Raisins from
California.</LD>
<LD>   To supporters of U.S.-Cuba trade, the five-day gathering that
starts Thursday is a symbol of the growing desire for economic
connections that have been thwarted by the 4-decade-old trade
embargo. More pragmatically, it will decide how Cuba parcels out tens
of millions of dollars in contracts--and with whom the Cubans will
build long-term trade relationships.</LD>
<TE>   The event comes at a time when Congress, under pressure from a
growing bloc of farm state lawmakers, liberals and others, weighs
dumping long-standing restrictions on travel to the island country.</TE>
<TE>   Under a 2-year-old liberalization of the trade embargo, Cuba is
allowed to buy U.S. food products if it pays cash. But the cash-only
restriction sharply limits deal-making. Businesses would like to sell
food on credit terms, as they do to most countries, and be free to
sell a full range of other products as well.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going down there to hold an olive branch to the Cuban
people, and offer to deal with them just as we do with everybody
else," said Mike Mauricio, owner of Florida Produce of Hillsborough
County, a wholesaler and broker.</TE>
<TE>   Yet traditional Cuban American groups and their allies in the Bush
administration see the show far differently, and their criticism has
complicated the deal-making even before the doors open.</TE>
<TE>   They fear that U.S. trade will give the regime badly needed cash
to sustain itself, and they portray the trade show as a plot hatched
by Cuban President Fidel Castro and U.S. agribusiness to put more
pressure on Congress to abandon the embargo.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a pyramid scheme of monumental proportions," said Joe
Garcia, executive director of the Miami-based Cuban American National
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has licensed the event, signaling that it
meets the requirements of U.S. law for such a gathering of Americans
in Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the top State Department official for Latin American affairs,
Assistant Secretary Otto J. Reich, has made clear his disapproval. He
set off a small flap by cautioning Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura and
others who plan to attend the show "not to participate in sexual
tourism, which is one of the main industries in Cuba." He said
high-profile visitors are "used as props" by the Castro government.</TE>
<TE>   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose prospects in the November election
ride partly on support from the Cuban American community, has urged
Ventura to stay home.</TE>
<TE>   Yet such pressures have done little to discourage businesses or
the many state officials who want to help build their local export
industries.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 285 companies from 33 states are showing products at the
huge white Pabexpo convention center in the Havana suburbs. These
include such big names as Archer Daniels Midland, which is the chief
sponsor of the event, as well as Cargill, ConAgra Foods, Hormel
Foods, Perdue Farms and Tyson Foods. Exhibition space in three big
halls has been sold out for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans have shipped in small herds of livestock, and
California is sending its Dancing Raisin mascots in hopes of opening
deals for the state's products.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. businesses hope their appearance can revive Cuban demand for
long-standing brands that Cubans knew before the revolution, such as
Aunt Jemima pancakes, Kellogg's cereals, Uncle Ben's rice and even
Spam, which is well liked in Cuba, industry officials say.</TE>
<TE>   When Congress passed the 2000 law authorizing cash food sales,
Castro at first signaled that he didn't intend to take advantage of
the opportunity. But he changed his mind, and has made purchase after
purchase.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Cuba ranked last among the 228 countries and territories
that import U.S. food and agricultural products. But in 2001, it
jumped to 144th, and this year it's expected $135 million in
purchases will make it 52nd, according to the U.S.-Cuba Trade and
Economic Council.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. agribusiness has tried to build political support for an end
to the embargo by spreading the contracts among as many states as
possible--just as defense contractors spread subcontracts around the
country to build broad political support for multibillion-dollar
procurement projects.</TE>
<TE>   That was the brainchild of Archer Daniels Midland, an agribusiness
giant with $20 billion in annual revenue and extensive U.S. political
influence.</TE>
<TE>   The top beneficiary of open trade would probably be Florida
because of its proximity and historical ties to Cuba, even though the
state is home to the staunchly anti-Castro Cuban Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Florida is sending 31 companies to the exhibition, more than any
other state.</TE>
<TE>   Mauricio, the Cuban American owner of Florida Produce, says this
reflects the fact that there's more than one point of view in the
Cuban American community about the embargo.</TE>
<TE>   "Economic embargoes do no good," he said. "They hurt the common
people."</TE>
<TE>   Some other businesses worry that the politics surrounding the
event could lead to criticism, and won't even disclose their names.
Some advocates of the event have sought to minimize the politics.</TE>
<TE>   "The exhibitors have specifically asked that anyone with a
political agenda stay home and stay out," said John Kavulich of the
U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it will be difficult to keep politics out of it, especially
because Castro himself promises to tour the exhibitions.</TE>
<TE>   Castro has been trying to build support for an end to the embargo
since 2000 by lobbying a succession of U.S. public officials,
including Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Sen. Maria Cantwell
(D-Wash.) and North Dakota Gov. John Hoeven, a Republican.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-Castro activists contend that the Cuban leader has funneled
his scarce cash to U.S. food contracts, with the goal of sharpening
the American appetite for a new market of 11 million people. They say
this has meant that Castro has been unable to pay debts to countries
that have long been food suppliers, such as Canada and European and
Latin American nations.</TE>
<TE>   They contend that if U.S. businesses trade on credit, Cuba will
default and U.S. taxpayers will have to make good on what is owed to
American companies.</TE>
<TE>   And they argue that the Cuban market will never really be an
important source of sales for U.S. business--or at least, not until
it has a free-market system.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Hays, a former U.S. diplomat who is executive vice
president of the fiercely pro-embargo Cuban American National
Foundation, says some U.S. businesses appear to have been dazzled by
the "forbidden fruit" of trade with Cuba and the opportunity to get a
close look at the Communist government.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems there's been a frenzy of 'Let's all go to Disneyland'
... to look at the last Communist dinosaur in its lair," Hays said.</TE>
<TE>   But Brian Alexander, policy director of the pro-trade Cuba Policy
Foundation, suggested that the real dinosaur is U.S. policy toward
Cuba. He said the unexpectedly strong interest in the show is a
demonstration that U.S. businesses have taken the initiative in
building ties to Cuba, even as the politicians have continued to
squabble.</TE>
<TE>   "Business has moved ahead of policy," he said. "It's time for
policy to catch up."</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>PRETORIA, South Africa</DL>
<LD>Two South African men appeared in court amid heavy security Monday to
face charges in connection with an alleged plot by white extremists
to overthrow South Africa's black-led government.</LD>
<LD>   Dirk Hanekom and Henk van Zyl were arrested Friday after several
weeks on the run. They join 10 other white men accused of planning to
attack army and police installations. A hearing was set for Oct. 2.
Police arrested Hanekom, 46, and Van Zyl, 37, during a raid on a farm
in Free State province. They were still searching for another
suspect. The 10 additional suspects include three former members of
the military. Four are out on bail; six are in custody.</LD>
<LD>   According to court documents, the alleged conspirators hoped to
recruit 3,700 people to seize army and police installations. Police
have also found arms caches they believe are connected to the case.</LD>
<TE>   Fringe right-wing groups are not considered a serious threat to
the African National Congress-led government. But analysts believe
they are still capable of causing damage.</TE>
<TE>   Mainstream Afrikaner leaders have condemned the alleged plotters
and say right-wing groups are taking advantage of Afrikaner concerns
about affirmative action, language preservation and crime.</TE>
<TE>   "For Afrikaners to position themselves as the permanent enemy of
the government will not solve their problems," Pieter Mulder, leader
of the mainstream Afrikaans Freedom Front, wrote in City Press, a

<HD>Energy Dealings Ruled Illegal</HD>
<DH>Regulation: El Paso Corp. created an artificial natural gas
shortage in California, a judge says. Finding could bolster case for
refunds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR and NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's biggest natural gas pipeline company illegally
manipulated the California market during the energy crisis, a federal
regulatory judge said Monday in a ruling that could bolster
wide-ranging claims for refunds.</LD>
<LD>   El Paso Corp. used a variety of strategies in 2000-01 to withhold
an average of at least 345 million cubic feet of natural gas a day
from California customers, creating an artificial shortage that drove
up prices, concluded Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr. of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission. Among the maneuvers, he said: El Paso failed
to use 21% of the capacity of its pipeline to the state.</LD>
<LD>   "El Paso pipeline did in fact withhold substantial capacity that
it could have made available to its California delivery points--a
clear exercise of market power," Wagner wrote in a 23-page opinion.</LD>
<TE>   In a preliminary ruling last year, the judge had found
insufficient evidence of manipulation, but he said new evidence
changed his mind. In addition to operating at less than capacity, he
said, El Paso did not use all available shipment routes into
California and scheduled nonessential maintenance operations that
sidelined some of its facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a major victory for California consumers," said Harvey
Morris, the lead California Public Utilities Commission lawyer on the
case. "It took us a long time, a lot of hearings, a lot of legal
briefs, but today we were vindicated."</TE>
<TE>   El Paso Corp. issued a statement decrying Wagner's decision as "an
unsupported attack on the prudence of a pipeline's operating
decisions." It said it would appeal to FERC's governing board.</TE>
<TE>   If the judge's ruling is upheld by the board, Morris said, it
could order the return of ill-gotten profit to customers, including
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. The board
had previously ordered limited refunds for California consumers but
none approaching the potential size of refunds in the El Paso case.</TE>
<TE>   State officials estimate that El Paso Corp. made as much as $900
million on its disputed California transactions. FERC could also
impose fines on El Paso, but those would go to the federal treasury,
not to California.</TE>
<TE>   The judge's finding is the latest addition to a growing body of
evidence suggesting that California's 2000-01 energy crisis was the
result of manipulative business practices and not merely regulatory
blunders and an imbalance of supply and demand.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the state Public Utilities Commission issued a report
saying most blackouts could have been avoided in 2001 had
California's five big private power plant operators produced as much
electricity as they were capable of generating.</TE>
<TE>   This is "one more nail in their coffin," said Richard Katz, an
energy advisor to Gov. Gray Davis, describing the ruling's effect on
the energy industry.</TE>
<TE>   Natural gas is the main fuel used by power plants in California,
and El Paso owns one of the major pipelines into Southern California.
During the energy crisis, the gas price at California's border soared
well above levels in the rest of the country and remained high even
as prices elsewhere fell in response to increased supplies.</TE>
<TE>   The case arose from a controversial gas shipping deal between El
Paso Natural Gas Co., which owns the pipeline, and El Paso Merchant
Energy Group, which sells natural gas. Both are subsidiaries of El
Paso Corp., a Houston-based energy conglomerate. The deal ultimately
boosted gas prices by $3.2 billion from June 2000 to May 31, 2001,
the PUC's Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso's stock plunged $4.61, or nearly 36%, after Monday's
ruling, closing at a 52-week low of $7.51 and becoming the most
active stock on the New York Stock Exchange. Investors' concerns also
spread to other energy marketers, sending their share prices lower.</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. put El Paso's debt on its credit watch
list. The Wall Street credit-rating service said that El Paso has
enough cash to pay its bills but that potential fines by FERC could
change that.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's opinion represented a sharp change of direction for
Wagner, FERC's senior judge. The case has continued for nearly 18
months, producing more than 7,700 transcribed pages of highly
technical testimony and more than 730 exhibits.</TE>
<TE>   In a preliminary ruling last year, Wagner found that the El Paso
subsidiaries had engaged in collusion and acquired a market position
that would allow them to manipulate the California market.</TE>
<TE>   But Wagner also concluded that there was insufficient evidence to
show that the companies followed through by taking advantage of their
customers, which included the state's largest utilities.</TE>
<TE>   After his initial ruling, the FERC board directed Wagner to go
back and review the operations of the pipeline. Wagner conducted
extensive new hearings last spring on the pipeline operation,
amassing 2,181 pages of testimony and 219 exhibits that formed the
groundwork for the ruling issued Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The deal between the El Paso pipeline and the same company's
marketing unit put as much as 17% of California's daily gas
consumption in the hands of one corporate entity. When the contract
expired May 31, 2001, the price markup between production fields in
Texas and the California border was $6.32 per million British thermal
units, according to trade publication Natural Gas Week. A week later,
after about 30 competitors had divided up the pipeline capacity, the
markup had plunged to less than 25 cents.</TE>
<TE>   The judge's ruling now goes to the full FERC board, which can
adopt or change it. Wagner recommended that the board institute a
penalty proceeding to punish what he termed "the unlawful exercise of
market power." As natural monopolies, pipeline systems operate under
federal rules intended to prohibit preferential treatment of any
shipper.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso Chief Executive William A. Wise said he expected the
company to prevail. A decision by the FERC board can be appealed in
federal courts, but U.S. judges have traditionally been reluctant to
overturn the independent panel's determinations.</TE>
<TE>   "We are disappointed that today's ... decision does not recognize
the substantial record [of] evidence supporting El Paso Natural Gas'
position that the pipeline was operated properly," Wise said. "We are
confident in the strength of our position and believe that we will
ultimately obtain a favorable ruling."</TE>
<TE>   El Paso has argued that its accusers imputed sinister motives to
legitimate business decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said she would ask for a Senate
Energy Committee hearing into the new evidence cited by Wagner.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe any refunds should go to Californians, who were the
most victimized by the scheme," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Christy Dennis, a spokeswoman for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric of San
Francisco, which joined the PUC's complaint against El Paso, said the
utility's attorneys expected a decision from FERC early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Lipson, a lawyer for Rosemead-based Edison, said he expected
the board to uphold Wagner's finding that the pipeline operator's
conduct was anti-competitive. Edison, which did much of the research
to support the PUC's complaint, will argue that the board should go
further than the judge and conclude that the deal between the two
subsidiaries also constituted misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really an extremely clear finding that El Paso Natural
Gas exercised market power," Lipson said.</TE>
<TE>   During the energy shortages in the winter of 2000-01, California
officials and consumer advocates charged that the crisis was
manufactured by energy companies taking advantage of the state's
deregulated market.</TE>
<TE>   The companies vehemently denied any market manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   But the charges gained new credence in May, when FERC released
Enron Corp. memos detailing an array of trading ploys to create
artificial shortages.</TE>
<TE>   After those revelations, several other companies acknowledged that
they engaged in sham trades to improve revenues, and FERC widened its
investigation into market manipulation.</TE>

<LD>Re "In Santa Cruz, an Official Handout of Medicinal Pot," Sept. 18:
After being diagnosed with a rare lymphoma last December, I began
chemotherapy in January and experienced severe nausea. My doctor
recommended that I use marijuana and promptly wrote me a
recommendation. Smoking marijuana has allowed me to maintain my
weight and appetite and has made the majority of the chemotherapy
side effects tolerable. Unfortunately, it is much easier for me to
pick up some quite addictive morphine or Marinol, which doesn't help
me, at a pharmacy than it is for me to get some marijuana.</LD>
<LD>   There are currently no cannabis buyers' clubs in Los Angeles to
provide cancer patients like me with a necessary and useful medicine.
I applaud Mayor Christopher Krohn and the Santa Cruz City Council
members for taking a stand to alleviate suffering among the
critically and terminally ill. Mayor James Hahn, would you please
step up to the plate and go to bat for the sick people of Los
Angeles?</LD>

<TE>   Re "Parents Warned on Pot's Toll," Sept. 18: The core message of
drug czar John Walters is certainly worth heeding, but he risks
losing credibility by deliberately misrepresenting government data.
According to the drug czar, more teens are in treatment for marijuana
than alcohol and all illegal drugs combined. Record numbers of
Americans arrested for marijuana possession have been forced into
treatment by the criminal justice system. The resulting distortion of
treatment statistics is then used by the drug czar to make the claim
that marijuana is "addictive."</TE>
<TE>   There is a big difference between voluntary treatment and
government coercion. Zero-tolerance drug laws do not distinguish
between occasional use and chronic abuse. The coercion of Americans
who prefer marijuana to martinis into taxpayer-funded treatment
centers says a lot about government priorities but absolutely nothing
about the relative harms of marijuana.</TE>

<HD>Paid Leave Bill Puts a Few Families First</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis' reasoning for signing the outrageous paid family
leave bill (Sept. 23) is that he believes in putting families first.
OK, fine. But what about the issues that matter the most to the most
families? What about the tax burden that takes an unbearable bite out
of household income? What about the families whose children suffer in
public schools so that the teachers union and the administration
don't lose power or have to admit failure? What about the families
whose breadwinner may lose his job when his employer cannot afford to
support another employee's paid leave?</LD>
<LD>   May I suggest a clarification of Davis' rhetoric: "I believe in
putting a few families first at the expense of many others for cheap
political gain and the appearance of taking action."</LD>
<LD>   Brian Dean</LD>
<TE>   Van Nuys</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First we had unpaid family leave. Now we have family leave paid
for by an employee-supported fund. Soon we will find out that
whatever the employee paid, the fund is not enough to pay for the
actual cost. We will then have to deny or decrease the benefit to
some members or raise the cost. No way! We will "invite" the employer
to participate in this matter. Maybe we can "volunteer" the employer
to pay for the entire cost and get it over with. Employers love their
employees, don't they?</TE>
<TE>   Members of the fund will take advantage of it because they paid
for the "benefit." Let's see, if I am going to have a baby ... I will
join the fund--at $70 a year, for a benefit of $728 a week for six
weeks, which comes to $4,368. Not a bad deal. Can anyone imagine that
I will not take advantage if I paid for the benefit? Bonding with my
baby or not, it is good to have some paid time off. I will take
advantage of the fund, too, when my spouse gets sick, when my parent
gets sick and when my grandparent gets sick--I paid for it.</TE>
<TE>   When I have enough kids, I may just quit the fund. No, come to
think of it, I'd better stay in the fund. My spouse, kids, parents
and grandparents can take turns getting "sick" each year. I can get
paid to take care of them, at least once a year, every year. Of
course, they could have an early recovery, but who is telling? I am
getting six weeks off, paid.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, my employer has nobody to do my job.</TE>

<HD>A Few 'Squeaky Wheels' on Our Shared Trails</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thanks for the thoughtful Sept. 21 editorial on sharing trails with
bicycles. I'd be careful about overestimating the level of user
conflict, though. I've been hiking and riding the trails of the Santa
Monica Mountains for 20 years. Most of the people on the trails get
along just fine. There's an abundance of research that says that
perceptions of user conflict are exaggerated by the frequent,
multiple complaints of a small number of people. On the bike issue,
I've seen this time and time again.</LD>
<LD>   Building a trail community presents the same challenge as building
a community in the city. How do we discover our commonalities while
respecting and managing our differences? We shouldn't let strident,
anti-bicycle extremists occupy more than their tiny place at the
table. Shared trails benefit the most people, are most
environmentally friendly, are most cost-effective and function as a
shared community resource. Reasonable people can work this through.</LD>

<LD>I object strenuously to Thomas Lash equating the U.S. holding Al
Qaeda terrorists at Guantanamo Bay to Nazi concentration camps
(letters, Sept. 21). If Lash cannot tell the difference between
people who took up arms and attacked the U.S. and innocent people
whose only crime was being Jewish, then I guess there really isn't
anything to discuss. I'll consider taking his comments seriously when
we indiscriminately start marching these villains off to gas
chambers.</LD>

<LD>Re "Schroeder Hangs On in Germany," Sept. 23: President Bush proves
he can win elections--in Germany he pulled a rabbit out of the hat
for the party opposing his Iraqi adventure. How did he manage that?
By scaring people about his threats of unilateral military action.
Now, why would Germans be especially sensitive about replacing
diplomacy with war? Maybe they learned through bitter historical
experience that a strong nation's unilateral military imposition of
its dominance reaps only the whole world's enmity.</LD>

<TE>   Even Bush's most outspoken critics can agree that he is not Adolf
Hitler. So what is the harm in comparing their policies? The remark
allegedly made by German Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin was
neither slanderous nor necessarily untrue. At most she suggested that
we keep an eye on the president's tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Was Daeubler-Gmelin so far off? After all, our country does keep
voting for increased socialism and denial of individual rights. And
as Hitler needed a scapegoat, so we now have the terrorists and
Saddam Hussein. The framework is forming; the next move is up to us.</TE>

a week I was overjoyed at hearing the news that U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Saddam Hussein reached an agreement
that would give U.N. weapons inspectors unconditional access. We now
learn from Iraq that the agreement was not unconditional at all. That
being the case, why was Annan not forthcoming in pointing out that
what Iraq and the news media had reported was not accurate? Annan has
lost credibility. The Bush administration was correct in its
assessment of Iraq's skewed definition of "unconditional." As a
lifetime Democrat, I am thankful that George W. Bush is in the White
House. He has my wholehearted support.</LD>

<TE>   No matter what else is accomplished, if this administration's
plans to attack Iraq go forward, the gates of hell will be opened
wide and we will all suffer, for many generations. Cooler heads must
prevail.</TE>

<TE>   Instead of talking about attacking Iraq and making more problems
by going to war with Iraq, why not let the U.N. inspection teams go
back into Iraq? Just warn Hussein that if he refuses to let the
inspectors inspect certain sites (i.e., the palaces) then the
inspectors will use a satellite cell phone to report it, and the U.S.
Air Force will bomb any site that the inspectors aren't allowed to go
into within a few hours. That should put the pressure on Hussein to
let the inspectors go where they need to go, without any limits.</TE>

<TE>   We may be justified in doubting the wisdom and intelligence behind
the current administration's war plans. But as November approaches it
is obvious that Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney do know one thing
about war: how to create an effective diversion. Too bad they're
using it on their own country.</TE>

<TE>   I am frankly scared and puzzled by the Bush administration's new
foreign policy plan ("Bush Describes Tough Foreign Policy Vision,"
Sept 21). Leaving aside the Orwellian implications of a policy like
"preemptive self-defense," can we reasonably expect that if the
United States establishes this precedent it won't catch on? What
happens when China decides to get preemptive with Taiwan, or India
with Pakistan? Am I supposed to feel safer now?</TE>
<TE>   We need a foreign policy that creates lasting security, not one
that sets destabilizing precedents.</TE>

<TE>   After reading "Bush Puts Democrats on the Spot With Resolution on
Iraq War" (Sept. 20) and "We Need Answers, Mr. Bush" (editorial,
Sept. 20), about Bush's request for a resolution on Iraq, I have come
to one conclusion: Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer plus the
editors of The Times are cowards. It is because of their attitudes
that 9/11 occurred. They do not want the United States to do anything
until another catastrophe occurs.</TE>

<HD>Bill OKd to Cut Cost of Contact Lenses</HD>
<DH>Legislation: The law allows consumers to get prescriptions
and shop for the best price. The governor also approves creation of
governing body for water agency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis signed a popular bill Monday aimed at reducing the
cost of contact lenses by enabling about 4 million consumers to
comparison-shop among the neighborhood pharmacy, Internet, mail-order
houses and discount retailers.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, which cleared both houses of the Legislature with only
two no votes, will require that consumers be given a copy of their
lens prescription by optometrists and ophthalmologists after an
examination and fitting.</LD>
<LD>   With the prescription, they then can search for the best prices,
promoting competition among sellers and driving down prices, Davis
said. Prices can range from a few dollars for common disposable
lenses to $150 or more for specialty lenses for consumers with health
problems.</LD>
<TE>   The bill, AB 2020 by Assemblyman Lou Correa (D-Anaheim), was
supported by the Center for Public Interest Law at San Diego, other
consumer advocates and the California Optometric Assn. Edward
Hernandez, the association's president, said that more than two dozen
states have enacted similar laws and that national legislation is
pending in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike eyeglasses, copies of prescriptions for contact lenses are
not provided to patients in California. State Consumer Affairs
Director Kathleen Hamilton termed release of the prescription "the
ticket that enables consumers to shop wherever they want."</TE>
<TE>   Davis also signed one of the most important water bills of the
year, SB 1653 by Sen. Jim Costa (D-Fresno). The bill creates a formal
governing body for CalFed, a 7-year-old consortium of federal and
state agencies working to protect the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta as
both a home for threatened fish and a major water source for Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   For three years, lawmakers struggled to design a governing body
for CalFed. The venture, with a 30-year plan, has spent about $1.5
billion of state funds.</TE>
<TE>   The bill creates a California Bay-Delta Authority with
representatives of six state agencies, six federal agencies and seven
public members from various regions of the state.</TE>
<TE>   Congress must enact a law allowing the federal agencies to
participate in the new CalFed authority by 2006 or the state law will
expire.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also signed a bill by Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier) that
will expand a program offering discounted automobile insurance to
low-income drivers. The bill changes the income threshold for
eligibility so that tens of thousands more poor people will qualify.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, SB 1427, which was sponsored by the Foundation for
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, will reduce the cost of the policy to
$347 a year from $450 in Los Angeles and to $314 from $410 in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   In other action Monday, Davis vetoed two bills:</TE>
<TE>   * Veterans--AB 748 by Assemblyman Ed Chavez (D-La Puente) would
have ordered the independent Bureau of State Audits to examine the
effectiveness and finances of the troubled Cal-Vet farm and home loan
program for veterans. Davis objected to requiring the Department of
Veterans Affairs to pay for the bureau's investigation and, instead,
said he will order the department's inspector general to do the
audit.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico--AB 552 by Assemblyman Marco Firebaugh (D-Los Angeles)
would have created a committee to advise on state participation in
Mexican projects aimed at reducing migration to California. Davis
said immigration was an important question in California, but said
the issue of development in foreign countries, even neighboring
Mexico, "is a federal, not state, responsibility."</TE>

<HD>Bratton Exhibits Results --and a Taste for Limelight</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Finalist for chief has strong qualifications. But his
independence and hunger for publicity hurt him when he led the New
York department.</DH>
<SE>Last of three candidate profiles</SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The day after former New York Police Commissioner William Bratton
announced that he wanted to be chief of the Los Angeles Police
Department, he sent Los Angeles city leaders a copy of his
autobiography and a packet of press clippings as thick as the
Westside phonebook.</LD>
<LD>   The stack included a profile from the New Yorker declaring him the
"CEO Cop," and a New York Times editorial lauding Bratton as an
energetic leader who made a difference.</LD>
<LD>   Through the strength of his resume--and his own forceful public
relations campaign--Bratton was determined to make the cut for the
LAPD job. As a result, few at Los Angeles City Hall expressed
surprise last week when the Police Commission named Bratton one of
three finalists for the job, along with Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez
and John Timoney, former commissioner of the Philadelphia Police
Department and a onetime deputy to Bratton in New York.</LD>
<TE>   During his NYPD tenure from 1994 through 1996, Bratton's
management reorganizations and crime-fighting tactics helped force a
national reexamination of the role of police in combating crime.</TE>
<TE>   But Bratton, 54, also is a man who keeps his own clippings. His
determination to tout his accomplishments was deeply resented by his
boss, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Eventually, the mayor had enough and
forced the commissioner through a public ethics examination that
eventually persuaded Bratton to resign.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Bratton brings the same blend of self-promotion and
accomplishment to the final round of the debate over who is best
suited to run the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm extremely aware of what the problems are in the LAPD,"
Bratton said in an interview. "I can go in there very quickly and
turn it around. I really do believe I'm the right person at the right
time for the LAPD and for Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton is a veteran of three major police agencies, having led
the New York City Transit Police and the Boston Police Department
before taking over the NYPD in 1994. But it is his two years at the
helm of the NYPD that form the basis of his candidacy today.</TE>
<TE>   While Bratton served as commissioner of the NYPD, crime in New
York City declined so sharply that the trend helped refocus the study
of crime and punishment. To this day, experts argue over what was
responsible, but the numbers were stark and the effect on life in New
York palpable.</TE>
<TE>   Starting just before Bratton took over and accelerating during his
tenure, crimes of all sorts fell. Serious felonies--murder, rape,
robbery and the like--dropped 33%. The murder rate was cut in half.
Other cities, including Los Angeles, saw declines as well, but none
on the order of New York's.</TE>
<TE>   Up to that point, many academic experts on crime tended to
attribute to police little influence on criminal behavior. They
preferred instead to examine factors such as economic conditions,
demographics, drug use and incarceration rates. After New York's
experience, many had difficulty excluding policing strategies as at
least one significant contributor.</TE>
<TE>   For Bratton, there were other benefits. He was, for instance,
featured on the cover of Time magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a strategic thinker with a proven track record," said
longtime New York City journalist Richard Esposito. "If he gets the
job, he will be very, very good for Los Angeles ... But you have to
realize that publicity is Bill Bratton's Viagra."</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani strongly urged Bratton to take a lower profile. Civil
rights advocates complained that the NYPD had become too aggressive.
Even some law enforcement experts who were convinced that police
deserved some credit for the radical reduction in dangerous activity
warned that Bratton tended to claim too much credit--that there were
larger national forces at work beyond the New York experience. Others
gave the department credit for knocking down crime rates, but warned
that the progress had come with other social costs.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Bratton is a showboat," said Stephen Yagman, a lawyer who
frequently has sued the LAPD and who lived in New York when Bratton
was police commissioner. "And there is no question in my mind that
the crackdown on crime was based on a racial profiling component.
They were targeting minorities in poor communities." Twenty-seven
months after pinning on the NYPD badge, Bratton was out the door. He
immediately went to work as a consultant, earning more than a
half-million dollars a year, traveling the globe, giving advice to
police agencies on how to cut crime.</TE>
<TE>   One of those agencies was the LAPD, where Bratton served as part
of the monitoring team overseeing the department's compliance with a
consent decree under the supervision of a federal judge. When it
became clear that Mayor James K. Hahn was inclined to deny LAPD Chief
Bernard C. Parks a second five-year term, Bratton dropped his
position on that team in favor of seeking to become the department's
next chief.</TE>
<TE>   Never lacking in confidence, Bratton had barely submitted his
application before he and his wife, Court TV anchor Rikki Klieman,
began searching for a house--in Brentwood. (Klieman is Bratton's
fourth wife.)</TE>
<TE>   "I've been successful everywhere I've worked in policing," Bratton
said. "I've traveled all over the world. But I realize, as a
consultant, you can only cajole. You cannot create change."</TE>
<TE>   City officials have greeted Bratton's candidacy with mixed views.
While pleased that the post has attracted such an undeniably national
figure as Bratton, some of Hahn's aides are concerned about the
former commissioner's track record in New York. The mayor's advisors
say Hahn might accept Bratton's penchant for publicity, as long as he
can reform the department and make Los Angeles the safest big city in
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Jim Hahn has made it clear that he wants a chief who is going to
be a partner and who is going to understand that he works for the
mayor," said a longtime Los Angeles political consultant, Rick
Taylor. "The stronger you are as an independent law enforcement
leader, the less likely you are to get the job."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, who is scheduled to meet with Hahn today, has pledged to
be part of a team, with the mayor and his staff. He insists that he
knows that Hahn is the boss--and goes so far as to say that he agrees
with Hahn about everything.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't a thing the mayor has said that I haven't agreed
with," Bratton said. "I'm a team player, and I always have been."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Boston, and set
out early to become a cop. He volunteered to serve as a military
officer in Vietnam, and when he returned from the war in 1970, he
joined the Boston Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   As a young officer there, he won a medal of valor for an incident
that highlighted his developing gift for gab: He persuaded a bank
robber to surrender a hostage being held at gunpoint. Bratton worked
his way up in Boston, and in 1990 he was offered the job as head of
the transit police in New York City. Those were troubled times in New
York, a city haunted by the case of a young woman jogger attacked and
left for dead in Central Park by a gang of men.</TE>
<TE>   "Their 'wilding' attacks came to epitomize how unsafe New York had
become," Bratton said.</TE>
<TE>   In charge of policing New York's vast subway system--where crimes
from cheating the token system to attacking riders were frighteningly
common--Bratton equipped his officers with better gear and directed
them to ignore nothing. He would go out with them on patrol, even in
the middle of the night, and he launched a campaign to focus on
low-level offenses. Token-jumpers, he argued, were committing a small
offense, but they established a tone of lawlessness for the subway
system and went on to commit bigger crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Stop the small offenses, he said, and bigger crimes will decline
as well. Within months, those efforts appeared to pay off, as
assaults dropped nearly to nothing on the New York subway.</TE>
<TE>   His success was noticed in New York and in his hometown of Boston,
where he was offered the job as head of Boston's police department.
Bratton accepted the Boston offer and left New York.</TE>
<TE>   He was back in his hometown only a few months before Giuliani
called, asking him to return back to New York as head of the NYPD.</TE>
<TE>   From Day 1, Bratton framed his job in military terms. In a
swearing-in speech that consciously borrowed the wartime rhetoric of
Winston Churchill, he vowed: "We will fight for every house in the
city. We will fight for every street. We will fight for every
borough. And we will win."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Bratton wrote in his book:</TE>
<TE>   "The turnaround had begun. Like Babe Ruth pointing his bat to the
bleacher indicating where his next home run would land, I was
confidently predicting the future."</TE>
<TE>   The rhetoric may have played well with New Yorkers, but it
concerned Giuliani and his aides, who were worried that Bratton, from
the outset, was claiming too high a profile.</TE>
<TE>   They were also concerned about Bratton's frequent appearances on
the evening news, whether he was publicly dressing down officers
accused of corruption or explaining the logic behind COMPSTAT, the
new, computerized crime-fighting system that he helped devise, which
made local police commanders accountable for identifying and reducing
crime in their precincts.</TE>
<TE>   Using computerized maps to pinpoint crimes by type, hour and
frequency of occurrence, Bratton and his staff were able to identify
patterns and direct police efforts. Bratton would also meet weekly
with area captains to review crime statistics and devise strategies
to combat hot spots. Those meetings, to which reporters occasionally
were invited, came to symbolize the NYPD's new determination and
accountability.</TE>
<TE>   As Bratton trumpeted his efforts, he ran afoul of a mayor whose
reputation also depended on credit for fighting crime. Giuliani, a
former federal prosecutor elected in part on a platform to combat New
York street crime, generally forbade his department heads to speak to
the media unless it had been cleared through the mayor's press
office.</TE>
<TE>   There was a steady stream of directives from Giuliani's office to
Bratton, requesting that he tone down or eliminate his extended
meetings with reporters. But the warnings were rarely heeded. The
situation worsened in January 1996, when he--not Giuliani--made the
cover of Time magazine for a story on New York's "miracle" reduction
in crime.</TE>
<TE>   Making matters worse, Bratton offered to revive an old tradition
of having police parades in the city. The date he floated for a
possible event happened to be his birthday, and the mayor's office
killed the plan, saying it would be too costly.</TE>
<TE>   With tensions already high, Giuliani then raised public concerns
when Random House announced that it was giving the police chief a
$300,000 advance to write "Turnaround."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor was not happy with this news, especially because Bratton
had not cleared the book deal with him beforehand. Throwing down the
gauntlet, he asked the city's corporation counsel to investigate
whether the book deal represented a conflict of interest. By this
time, Bratton's term as police commissioner was up for mayoral
renewal, and Giuliani said he would not even consider the matter
until the investigation was concluded. Bratton, reading the writing
on the wall, resigned his post.</TE>
<TE>   The two men never buried the hatchet. Giuliani almost never
comments on his former police commissioner, but aides have privately
questioned Bratton's behavior in office.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is that Bill Bratton couldn't live within any
limits," said a source familiar with the personalities and inner
workings of the Giuliani administration. "He had to have everything
his way. He loved media attention."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Bratton openly criticized the NYPD and Giuliani's
leadership when tensions between police and minorities erupted after
Bratton had left. In 1999, when four officers shot and killed Amadou
Diallo, an unarmed West African street peddler, Bratton said New York
police needed to improve their relations with various minority
communities.</TE>
<TE>   He did continue to praise Giuliani for spearheading the city's
crusade against crime, saying in a 2000 interview: "The mayor
deserves credit, because if the crime rate had gone up, he'd be
taking the heat."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Bratton also compared Giuliani with Richard Nixon and added of
the New York mayor: "The problem with his personality is excess. He
kicks you while you're down, and it's worked by and large, because
he's intimidated the hell out of this town."</TE>
<TE>   In interviews now, Bratton says he'd like to put his differences
with Giuliani behind him and move West.</TE>
<TE>   After more than a year of working with the independent monitoring
team tracking the LAPD's compliance with its consent decree, Bratton
knows whom to call. He has spent weeks networking behind the scenes
with Los Angeles leaders and law enforcement experts.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton believes the LAPD is in the same state in which he found
the NYPD in 1994: Officers, fearful of controversy, are trying to
find ways to stay out of trouble instead of policing the city;
Bratton says they need leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm somebody who likes dealing with crisis," he said. "I'm like a
player who likes four or five batting machines pitching balls at me
at the same time."</TE>

<LD>The White House on Monday took issue with California's new law
supporting stem cell research, even as administrators of a
$24.6-million state fund said they would begin soliciting proposals
from 10,500 scientists for new stem cell experiments.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation Sunday that says the state, as
a broad matter of policy, encourages research using stem cells,
including those from human embryos. While embryos are usually donated
by patients at fertility clinics, the legislation also supports
cloning as a way to create human embryos for stem cell research.</LD>
<LD>   Reacting Monday to the California law, White House spokesman Ari
Fleischer initially said President Bush saw the measure as a matter
of states' rights.</LD>
<TE>   "As a governor, he did not appreciate the federal government
stepping in, telling states what to do," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he amended his comments: "The president believes that all
policies, state or federal, need to respect the culture of life. He
differs with Gov. Davis on this."</TE>
<TE>   Public support for research using stem cells has pitted many
scientists against antiabortion groups and some religious
denominations.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists say stem cells can illuminate the basic workings of
cellular life. Many hope they also can be fashioned into cures for
disease.</TE>
<TE>   Antiabortion groups and the Roman Catholic Church, however, are
pushing Congress to bar the research because of the use of cells from
embryos.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has limited federal funding for stem cell research to only a
narrow range of experiments using groups of stem cells, known as cell
lines, that already exist.</TE>
<TE>   Several states, including Iowa, Michigan and South Dakota, have
passed legislation to ban embryo research or cloning within their
borders. California is the first to pass a law supporting stem cell
research, said Alissa Johnson of the National Conference of State
Legislatures.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation makes only relatively minor changes to state law.
It was already legal to isolate and study embryonic stem cells,
though federal funding was limited. It also was legal to create
cloned human embryos for research, though not with taxpayer money and
not to create a child.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say the law is intended to give a morale boost to stem
cell scientists, some of whom had abandoned the field for fear of
building their careers on research that soon would be barred or
curtailed by the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   Now, state officials say the state is on record as being "open for
business" for stem cell scientists.</TE>
<TE>   An administrator for a University of California program said she
was moving quickly to solicit proposals for state-funded experiments.
"We are sending out a mailing this week," said Susanne Huttner,
associate vice provost for research at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Huttner administers the UC Discovery Grant program, which gives
out $24.6 million annually to UC scientists. She said the fund had
supported stem cell research in the past but had gotten no new
applications in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "We stopped getting proposals when the political debate started to
peak in Washington," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The law adds requirements for work with human embryos:</TE>
<TE>   * Scientific and ethical review boards must approve any stem cell
experiments done by private companies. Most companies use such boards
voluntarily. The boards already are required of any scientist using
federal money.</TE>
<TE>   * Fertility doctors are now required to discuss with their
patients the options of discarding extra embryos, donating them to
another couple or offering them to researchers. They also may be
frozen for future attempts at pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, of the state legislatures group, said California was
"unique" in requiring doctors to discuss donation for research.</TE>
<TE>   * No one may buy or sell embryos or fetal material for research
purposes, though scientists may pay "reasonable" processing or
transportation costs.</TE>
<TE>   A federal ban on cloning or embryonic stem cell research would
trump the new state law, though advocates of the measure would likely
take the issue to court.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, Davis signed into law a bill that makes it illegal to
use cloning to produce a child, extending a ban due to expire Jan. 1.</TE>

<HD>Robert L. Forward, 70; Physicist Wrote 11 Science Fiction
Novels</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert L. Forward, the physicist who studied the matter-antimatter
propulsion system visualized in "Star Trek" and added imagination to
solid science to write 11 science fiction novels, has died. He was
70.</LD>
<LD>   Forward died Saturday in Seattle, his son-in-law, Ben Mattlin of
Los Angeles, said.</LD>
<LD>   Forward had lived in Washington state since 1994, when he
co-founded Tethers Unlimited, creator of space tethers used by NASA
and the Air Force.</LD>
<TE>   Forward held bachelor's and doctoral degrees in gravitational
physics from the University of Maryland and a master's from UCLA. He
worked for more than 30 years at Hughes Aircraft Co. research
laboratory in Malibu and held 20 patents.</TE>
<TE>   The author of 157 scientific papers, Forward was nearing 50 when
he published his first novel, "Dragon's Egg," in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he'd advised so many other science fiction writers on the
technical details of space flight and other futuristic esoterica,"
Mattlin said, "that he decided to give it a try himself."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Forward's science nor his fiction was simple.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to find things that other people think are impossible and
see if there isn't some way I can find to make them come true," he
said in an article in The Times in 1987, when he was still with
Hughes. "Twenty years ago I set myself to find, one, a way to go to
the stars; two, a way to control gravity, specifically to make an
anti-gravity machine; and three, find a time warp or time machine."</TE>
<TE>   Known from his 20s for his shock of white hair, white bow ties,
gray suits and brightly colored vests, Forward earned his first
patent for the invention he built for his doctoral thesis in 1965.
That was the world's first antenna that could detect gravitational
radiation--or what we know as gravity. The plans and prototype are in
the Smithsonian Institution.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now," he said in 1987, "I'm working on antimatter
propulsion [used by the starship Enterprise in "Star Trek" sagas]. In
fact, we have shown it is not only probably physically feasible, but
it is something we can do in the next 30 years."</TE>
<TE>   At one meeting of the American Astronautical Society, he outlined
27 theoretical propulsion systems, each more efficient than current
chemical rockets and each supported by a scientific study.</TE>
<TE>   Forward was also interested in "solar sailing," involving light
craft equipped with thin sails 600 miles wide and powered by "wind"
created by photons from the sun or by laser energy focused by a lens
also 600 miles wide, as another means of traveling into deep space.</TE>
<TE>   The physicist in recent years operated Forward Unlimited, a
consulting company "specializing in exotic physics and advanced space
propulsion."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his scientific articles, Forward wrote or co-wrote
books of science fact, including "Future Magic" and, with Joel Davis,
"Mirror Matter: Pioneering Antimatter Physics," both published in
1988.</TE>
<TE>   With his science fiction--and there were a dozen or so published
short stories as well as the 11 novels--Forward also chose the
challenging route. Rather than merely conjuring a futuristic Earth,
he invented the stars or planets to which his propulsion systems
could transport man, and then created societies and intelligent life
forms in those imaginary worlds. He would spend a year with his
calculator designing his fictional site and its inhabitants before
beginning to write.</TE>
<TE>   "I write science articles and science fiction stories as
accurately as I can so that the reader will learn some science while
enjoying a story," he once told the anthology Contemporary Authors.
"However, I follow the rule: 'Don't let the facts stand in the way of
a good story.' "</TE>
<TE>   "Dragon's Egg," the first novel, and its sequel "Starquake," were
set on a neutron star where the force of gravity is 67 billion times
stronger than on Earth. Forward peoples the star with beings called
"cheela" whose lifespan is about 45 minutes and whose evolution is
equally rapid.</TE>
<TE>   For "The Flight of the Dragonfly," retitled "Rocheworld," and its
four sequels, Forward created twin planets, one wet and one dry,
bound gravitationally like bar-bells with no connecting bar. He
populated them with amoeba-like creatures called "flouwen" who had
brains but no other physical organs and spent their time in abstract
mathematical speculation, surfing the wild waves of their odd
world--and in sex.</TE>
<TE>   In his last novel, "Saturn Rukh" in 1997, Forward set his story in
the Saturn atmosphere and made his aliens "rukhs," or giant
two-headed flying creatures named for the "rocs" encountered by
Sinbad the Sailor in "The Thousand and One Nights."</TE>
<TE>   Sci-fi fans quickly made Forward a cult favorite. Critics,
however, offered mixed reviews, always praising the science and the
imagined aliens in his novels, but often calling the plots thin and
the humans shallow or even "humdrum."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Geneva, N.Y., Forward served in the Air Force in the
mid-1950s, rising to the rank of captain.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Martha Dodson Forward, and
daughter, Julie Forward Fuller, both of whom helped write some of his
novels; and three other children--Robert of Chatsworth, Mary Lois
Mattlin of Los Angeles and Eve Forward-Rollins of Mill Creek, Wash.;
and seven grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>State, Nonprofit Group Will Pay to Settle Class Funding
Dispute</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Department of Education and a Santa Ana nonprofit
group have agreed to pay the federal government more than $3 million
to settle one of several legal disputes over funding of English
classes for immigrants.</LD>
<LD>   The amount is only a fraction of an estimated $15 million that
federal officials say is unaccounted for from a 1990s statewide adult
education program. Federal officials say some of the money supposedly
was spent on classes that never took place.</LD>
<LD>   The state education agency, which administered the federally
funded project, said late last week it agreed to pay the U.S.
Department of Education $2.5 million. The state department was sued
in 1997 for allegedly overlooking questionable accounting practices
by several community organizations that were paid to conduct English
as a Second Language and citizenship classes for adult immigrants.
The state agency admitted no wrongdoing.</LD>
<TE>   In a separate settlement, Citizens in Action Community
Development, a Santa Ana nonprofit organization, agreed to pay nearly
$640,000 to the federal government, the group's attorney said Monday.
Federal prosecutors say they traced illegally obtained grant proceeds
to Citizens in Action, which received assets from another nonprofit
group, Los Angeles-based Hermandad Mexicana Nacional Legal Center.</TE>
<TE>   The legal center was among 10 community organizations accused in
1998 of misusing federal education grants. Federal prosecutors
accused Hermandad of spending money on real estate, among other
improper purposes. The state education department ceased funding the
groups that year and has since been trying to recover the money.</TE>
<TE>   In the only criminal charges to stem from the disputes, a federal
grand jury indicted Hermandad Mexicana National Legal Center, the Los
Angeles group, in July 2001.</TE>

<HD>Study Finds Housing Prices Thwart Latino Immigrants</HD>
<DH>Finances: Pepperdine researchers say chance for
homeownership grows distant--not just for the newly arrived, but for
their children as well.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSE CARDENAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The barriers faced by Latinos--who represent a plurality of the
state's new households--highlight the dilemma faced by all
Californians hoping to buy homes, according to new research to be
released today.</LD>
<LD>   But the study by Pepperdine University also warns of a particular
problem for Latinos: A wildly expensive market lacking in inventory
represents the first time that a largely immigrant but upwardly
mobile group could be widely prevented from reaching the American
dream that, in general, other immigrant groups have achieved.</LD>
<LD>   "What you don't want to see in California is a creation of a large
middle class that feels that not only will they not be able to buy a
home, but their children won't be able to buy a home," said co-author
Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow at the Davenport Institute for Public
Policy at Pepperdine University.</LD>
<TE>   While other private and government studies have documented the
housing crisis, Pepperdine's study--"Rewarding Ambition: Latinos,
Housing and the Future of California"--aimed to find out what the
state's "rising new majority" was experiencing, said Thomas Tseng, a
research fellow at the Davenport Institute.</TE>
<TE>   "In the future, the Latino population will become the mainstream,
and we realized that housing would be one of the primary issues that
they would have to deal with," Tseng said.</TE>
<TE>   The study included culling information from databanks and
interviewing 504 Spanish-surnamed renters and recent home buyers from
throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   Among the highlights of the study, researchers found that Latinos,
about a third of the population, buy more than 20% of all homes in
California. While nearly two-thirds of U.S.-born Latinos are
homeowners, less than a third of Latino immigrants are. Those who are
homeowners, native and immigrant, are largely recent purchasers.</TE>
<TE>   The rise of prices making it difficult to buy homes in California
coincides with an influx of immigrants in the last two decades,
according to the authors. In California, Latino immigrants are by and
large renters, and their desire to own is driven primarily by their
plans to form or grow their families.</TE>
<TE>   But most prospective home buyers--lacking the generational
resources that many longer-established Americans have--are looking
for affordable homes below $150,000 with a down payment of less than
$10,000. Despite the obstacles, 70% of those interviewed reported
being optimistic about their chances of buying a home within five
years.</TE>
<TE>   The study aims to help change government policies to allow greater
numbers of new housing units to be built--which the authors say would
bring home prices down.</TE>
<TE>   It particularly aims to catch the attention of Latino legislators
caught between the housing shortage that affects the Latino community
and groups that favor limited development or oppose it altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "This issue of housing crisis and shortage has been discussed
quite a bit already, [but] in many ways it has fallen on deaf ears,"
Tseng said.</TE>
<TE>   "It has not created ways in which to solve the impediments of
housing in California for developers."</TE>

<LD>A 24-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of killing her
3-year-old daughter Monday and stabbing her 5-year-old daughter.</LD>
<LD>   Keri Cervantes was taken into custody at her home in Sky Valley,
an unincorporated community southeast of Desert Hot Springs.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives were interviewing Cervantes late Monday but had not
determined a motive for the attack nor the circumstances, said
Riverside County Sheriff's Deputy John Kaiser.</LD>
<TE>   The initial call was listed by a dispatcher as "shots fired,"
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   But at the home in the 23000 block of Rudder Row, deputies found
the 5-year-old stabbed several times. She was flown by helicopter to
Riverside County Regional Medical Center, where she was in serious
but stable condition.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies also found the body of the 3-year-old, Kaiser said.
Investigators declined to say how she had died.</TE>
<TE>   Cervantes was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted
murder. No one else was home, authorities said, and Cervantes'
marital status was unclear.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a motive or anything," Kaiser said. "This
investigation is going to be continuing for awhile."</TE>

<HD>Attorney General to Probe Decision on Water Quality</HD>
<DH>Environment: Inland Empire regulators are accused of
letting two alleged polluters off the hook in secret meeting. Plume
affects wells in the Rialto area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer will look into claims that Inland
Empire officials improperly deliberated in secret before tearing up
an order to clean up a large pollution plume that has infiltrated a
series of water wells, a state senator said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Nell Soto (D-Pomona) asked for an investigation last week
into the pollution in and around the San Bernardino County city of
Rialto. She said she was heartened Monday by a conversation with the
attorney general.</LD>
<LD>   "He said he'd be happy to do it," Soto said. "I just want
something done. I'm just so tired of people not thinking that this is
serious. Here are these people at risk, and people don't care--or
they are acting like they don't care."</LD>
<TE>   Lockyer's spokeswoman, Sandra Michioku, said the attorney general
was preparing a response to Soto's request "as quickly as possible,"
but said it was not clear how long that would take.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control
Board, the state agency responsible for protecting water quality in
the region, rescinded an order demanding a cleanup by two companies
that once ran manufacturing operations in Rialto.</TE>
<TE>   The decision angered critics, many of whom say the official
response to the plume has been lackadaisical and irresponsible.</TE>
<TE>   Members of a task force of government officials believe the
contamination dates to a series of Cold War-era manufacturing
operations in Rialto and surrounding communities. Some of those
companies manufactured rockets, missiles and flares using
perchlorate--a chemical known to cause a number of ailments,
including thyroid problems and cancer.</TE>
<TE>   So far, 17 wells in San Bernardino County have been shut down
because of perchlorate pollution. In one well, perchlorate was found
at levels more than 200 times the state's danger threshold.</TE>
<TE>   In communities surrounding the plume, including Rialto and Colton,
municipal officials have said they fear the state will impose a
building moratorium if there isn't enough clean water left to support
new development.</TE>
<TE>   The task force has pinned much of the blame for the contamination
on two companies, both of which say they are not at fault. The
companies went before the Water Quality Control Board earlier this
month to contest orders that they clean up the site. After the board
adjourned into closed session, it announced that the cleanup order
was being thrown out.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, board members said they wanted to launch a broader
investigation by sending letters to as many as 20 companies that
might have had a hand in the contamination.</TE>
<TE>   The board says it had the legal right to deliberate in secret, in
part because of the potential threat of litigation over its decision.
It concedes that the public did not receive proper notice in advance
that there would be a closed-door meeting, but the board says that
was due only to a typographical error on an agenda.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the outcry over the board's decision, it will meet
again to deliberate the pollution investigation publicly in late
October, Assistant Executive Officer Kurt Berchtold said Monday.</TE>

protesters who gathered Monday at the state Capitol in Sacramento.
Activists condemned the Drug Enforcement Administration's recent
raids on sites where medical marijuana is grown. Agency officials say
the actions are justified because federal law overrules California's
Proposition 215, which made the drug legal if recommended by a
doctor.</CP>

<HD>Ex-Ventura Gang Member Released as D.A. Rejects 3rd Trial
in Fatal Beating</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After two mistrials and two years behind bars, a former Ventura gang
member accused of participating in a deadly 1999 assault was ordered
released from jail Monday as prosecutors decided not to retry the
case.</LD>
<LD>   Ramiro Salgado, 23, stood in a Ventura County courtroom, his arms
clasped behind his back, and smiled as prosecutors asked a judge to
dismiss murder and related gang charges.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Vincent J. O'Neill Jr. granted the request
and ordered Salgado freed by the end of the day.</LD>
<TE>   Salgado was the fifth and final defendant to stand trial for
murder in the death of 18-year-old William Zara. The other four were
convicted</TE>
<TE>   Zara, a theater stagehand, was outside his apartment the night of
Sept. 25, 1999, when members of a Ventura gang accused Zara's
neighbors of reporting their loud party to police.</TE>
<TE>   When Zara tried to defend his neighbors, he was beaten with a
baseball bat and a shovel, and kicked and stabbed in the chest. He
died of his wounds.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, O'Neill declared a mistrial after jurors deadlocked on
whether Salgado was guilty of second-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   After five days of deliberation, the panel was divided 10 to 2 in
favor of acquittal.</TE>
<TE>   In May, O'Neill declared a mistrial after jurors split 9 to 3 in
favor of acquittal.</TE>
<TE>   In both cases, jurors said, the dispute centered on Salgado's
statement to police about his participation in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   During an August 2000 recorded interview with investigators,
Salgado admitted kicking and stomping Zara as the teen tried to
shield himself from the angry mob. After last week's mistrial, three
jurors said the panel could not agree on whether Salgado was telling
the truth or telling investigators what he thought they wanted to
hear.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge on Monday sentenced a 27-year-old man to 33 years to life in
state prison for raping a woman whom he had threatened with a samurai
sword.</LD>
<LD>   Wilbert Ward McCoy of Los Angeles was convicted last November of
nine felony counts including rape, forcible oral copulation and
sexual penetration by a foreign object. His fingerprints were found
on the sword.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Michael Johnson pronounced sentence.</LD>
<TE>   The Dec. 13, 2000, attack occurred in an underground parking lot
in Koreatown.</TE>
<TE>   The victim, who was 18 at the time, said she had been grabbed from
behind and had never seen her assailant's face.</TE>
<TE>   McCoy's DNA linked him to the attack.</TE>
<TE>   McCoy, a pre-med junior at USC at the time, said he had been in
his apartment studying for finals. He said that his backpack, found
near the crime scene, had been stolen a month before.</TE>

<LD>Yosemite National Park's top administrator will soon be leaving his
job, a congressional aide said.</LD>
<LD>   A Yosemite spokesman said Monday that no decision has been
announced about Supt. Dave Mihalic. But an aide to Rep. George P.
Radanovich (R-Mariposa), whose district includes the park, said parks
officials in Washington, D.C., told the congressman that Mihalic was
going to be transferred.</LD>
<LD>   During three years on the job, Mihalic drew praise for pushing
through an ambitious planning blueprint for the valley floor, but he
was later criticized because several projects were slow to get off
the ground.</LD>
<TE>   His replacement is expected to be Mike Tollefson, a former chief
at Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park.</TE>

<HD>Caltrans Reinstates Ban on Signs, Flags Hung on Overpasses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reversing its position again, the state Department of Transportation
announced Monday that safety concerns have forced the agency to
remove all banners and signs--including American flags--posted on
freeway property.</LD>
<LD>   The decision comes only a week after Caltrans announced in court
papers that it would allow securely fastened banners and flags to
remain on freeway overpasses and bridges. But that position was a
reversal of a previous Caltrans announcement that freeway displays,
including flags, would be removed.</LD>
<LD>   Caltrans' flip-flop has angered free-speech advocates who accuse
the agency of ignoring a January court order that requires a
consistent policy regarding signs, banners and flags on freeway
property. Caltrans is appealing that order.</LD>
<TE>   Caltrans' policy on freeway displays came under scrutiny last year
when two Santa Cruz women sued the agency, accusing it of removing
banners with unpopular messages while allowing American flags to
remain. The judge hearing the lawsuit ordered Caltrans to either
remove all freeway signs, banners and flags or allow all such
displays to remain, regardless of the message.</TE>
<TE>   In its immediate response, Caltrans ordered the removal of all
freeway displays, including U.S. flags hung after last year's
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But earlier this month, Caltrans reversed its position, announcing
in court papers that it would allow all banners, signs and flags on
freeway property so long as they were securely fastened. Caltrans
officials said it reversed itself partly in response to complaints
from people who wanted to hang U.S. flags to express their
patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   But since the new policy was announced, Caltrans officials said
people throughout the state have flocked to bridges and overpasses to
hang signs, banners and flags. Officials say they worry those people
could be injured while hanging the displays.</TE>
<TE>   "The state freeway system cannot be a place for people to
congregate and post signs and banners," Caltrans spokesman Dennis
Trujillo said. He added that some freeway signs have also become
distractions to motorists.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for the women who filed suit against Caltrans said he
believes the agency reversed itself because many of the banners and
signs posted in recent days express unpopular messages that question
U.S. foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   "We are deeply disturbed by their actions," said Nathan Benjamin,
an attorney for Amy Courtney and Cassandra Brown. "The ultimate
effect is to chill the right to free speech."</TE>
<TE>   Trujillo rejects that charge, saying the agency's primary concern
is safety.</TE>
<TE>   Courtney and Brown filed the lawsuit last year after their banner
questioning U.S. bombing missions in Afghanistan was removed from a
freeway overpass in Scotts Valley. On the same overpass, a large U.S.
flag and a banner that expressed support for the New York victims of
the terrorist strikes were not removed.</TE>

<HD>Plea Bargain Riles Scorned Public Defenders</HD>
<DH>Justice: State attorneys group to seek a tougher sentence
for a lawyer who allegedly used a stolen identity to chastise her
colleagues in an online chat room.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Criminal defense lawyers make their living in part by pleading for
forgiveness on behalf of their clients. But in the case of Ana Maria
Patino, members of the California Public Defender Assn. are crying
out for blood.</LD>
<LD>   Patino is a Santa Ana attorney who used the organization's closed
Internet chat room to attack other members with a stream of angry
missives, association officials say.</LD>
<LD>   After being booted out of the group last year, Patino reemerged
surreptitiously, using the online identity of a young law school
graduate, prosecutors said. This prompted an investigation by the FBI
and local police that resulted in charges of identity theft and
forgery.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors, however, have agreed to dismiss the charges if Patino
apologizes, performs community service and pays $1,500 in fines.</TE>
<TE>   The deal has members of the association crying foul, saying that
Patino victimized them and avoided jail time by hiring a
well-connected defense lawyer. They say prosecutors are letting her
off too easily. They also complain that as the "victims" of the
crime, they were never consulted about the plea deal.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm astounded. Clearly the D.A. doesn't care about identity
theft," said association board member Don Landis, who is an Orange
County deputy public defender. "They're really interested in victims'
issues when they want to be tough on some indigent client who
pocketed something at Mervyn's, but when it comes to dealing with an
Orange County lawyer, it's a different matter. It's hypocritical."</TE>
<TE>   Members of the group--which is open to all defense attorneys--plan
to take the unusual step of asking a judge next month to scuttle the
plea bargain and demand stiffer punishment for Patino.</TE>
<TE>   Patino, a defense lawyer who specializes in appeals cases
involving immigration law, was the chat room's most active
participant.</TE>
<TE>   Firing off 10 to 15 critical messages a day on a variety of
criminal-defense topics, Patino would sometimes sign her electronic
missives as "Xena" or "Lady Anne."</TE>
<TE>   Chat-room users say many lawyers felt the heat of Patino's flames,
but the 54-year-old attorney allegedly crossed the line when she
picked fights with the leader of the Orange County Bar Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't know why you would think anyone would care what
you think," Patino wrote to then-Orange County Bar President Jennifer
Keller.</TE>
<TE>   "You never have ceased to amaze me in your pretentious sense of
power which you choose to gloat over people."</TE>
<TE>   Patino also took aim at association director Michael Cantrall,
cursing him and vowing to "bring you down and everyone else
associated with you."</TE>
<TE>   The defenders group responded by stripping Patino of her chat-room
privileges and terminating her membership in the association.</TE>
<TE>   But in June of last year, just weeks after she was bounced from
the chat room, Patino reemerged under a false identity, the
association said. Using the name and a bar license number of a
28-year-old law school graduate, Patino reportedly resumed her
electronic chats as Lianna Figueroa.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged ruse worked for several months, association officials
said, until Patino began to complain to the site's Webmaster about
service. The Webmaster reportedly recognized Patino's confrontational
style and telephoned the real Lianna Figueroa to ask whether she was
dissatisfied with the Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no clue what they were talking about," Figueroa said. "I
just finished law school. I never applied to them for an account."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities eventually charged Patino with identity theft, forgery
and fraud. Patino hired powerhouse Orange County defense lawyer Alan
Stokke, who discussed a plea deal with prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan Riezman said Stokke's political
connections played no role in the deal. "This is an appropriate
agreement based on the totality of the circumstances, and the
non-seriousness of the crime," Riezman said. "The victim suffered no
financial loss nor any loss of reputation."</TE>
<TE>   Riezman noted the matter would also be investigated by the State
Bar of California.</TE>
<TE>   Patino insists that she has done nothing wrong and is being
persecuted by the association. "I am innocent," Patino said. "I do
not know anything about Lianna Figueroa. I don't know her and I don't
know anything about an apology."</TE>
<TE>   She insists that the public defenders are out to get her. As an
appeals lawyer, she said, she regularly exposes the sloppy work of
public defenders.</TE>
<TE>   "Their motivation is to get back at me," Patino said. "I make them
look bad. They're motivated by envy."</TE>
<TE>   Figueroa, the lawyer whose identity Patino allegedly used, said
she has been troubled by the experience. She said prosecutors should
hold Patino to a higher standard because she is a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea what this person was telling people under my name,
and I'm worried people will think it's me who said it," Figueroa
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody seems to care. I went to the police and they said, 'Big
whoop, nobody lost any money.' I want somebody to take this
seriously."</TE>

<HD>John Baptist Wu, 77; Cardinal of Hong Kong</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cardinal John Baptist Wu, who led Hong Kong's Roman Catholic Church
through the sensitive transition from British to Chinese rule, died
Monday in Hong Kong of complications from bone marrow cancer. He was
77.</LD>
<LD>   Hong Kong's political leader, Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, said
Monday that he was deeply grieved by Wu's death and expressed his
condolences to the church.</LD>
<LD>   "He had worked tirelessly to serve the Catholic community and made
great contributions to the well-being of Hong Kong people," Tung said
in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   Born in 1925 on the mainland, Wu was ordained in 1952, named a
bishop in 1975 and appointed Hong Kong's first cardinal in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Wu led a thanksgiving service attended by more than
1,000 people to mark the Vatican's canonization of 120 missionaries
killed in China. Mainland officials said the canonization was an open
insult.</TE>
<TE>   Wu and Bishop Joseph Zen, the church's No. 2 leader in Hong Kong,
have spoken in defense of the spiritual group Falun Gong, which is
banned on the mainland but remains legal in Hong Kong. The church has
also urged the local government to grant residency rights to
mainland-born children of legal residents who were ordered to be
deported in a key court ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Pope John Paul II expressed his heartfelt condolences in a message
to the Hong Kong diocese.</TE>
<TE>   "I am certain that his memory will live on in the community he so
faithfully served, inspiring all to ever greater generosity in
Christian living," the message said.</TE>
<TE>   Wu was the third cardinal to die this month, leaving 115 cardinals
younger than 80, who are eligible to vote for a pope.</TE>
<TE>   Wu is to be succeeded by Zen, a vocal critic of Beijing who has
been barred from visiting mainland China since 1998, two years after
he was made a bishop.</TE>
<TE>   There are 347,000 Roman Catholics in Hong Kong. Under Wu's
leadership, the church occasionally ventured into sensitive political
territory, drawing on civil liberties guaranteed to Hong Kong when
the British colony reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.</TE>

<HD>Gore Assails Bush's Stance on Iraq, Questions Motive for
War</HD>
<DH>Politics: In fiery speech in San Francisco, he says a
unilateral attack would hinder the struggle against terrorism and
estrange key U.S. allies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Former Vice President Al Gore delivered a searing indictment Monday
of President Bush's foreign policy and the march toward war with
Iraq, saying it has undermined the fight against terrorism and could
make the world a more dangerous place.</LD>
<LD>   Using unusually harsh language and a sometimes mocking tone, Gore
suggested Bush was exploiting tensions with Iraq for political gain
and to distract, as Gore put it, from the administration's failure to
capture and punish those responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "I do not believe that we should allow ourselves to be distracted
from this urgent task simply because it is proving to be more
difficult and lengthy than was predicted," Gore said in a critique
that set him apart from the rest of the prospective Democratic
presidential field. "Great nations persevere and then prevail. They
do not jump from one unfinished task to another."</LD>
<TE>   Further, Gore asserted that Bush's "go-it-alone, cowboy-type
approach to international affairs" risked further antagonism overseas
and that some of the steps taken in the name of security at
home--including the detention of suspects without legal
representation--were "beyond the pale and un-American."</TE>
<TE>   "We can effectively defend ourselves abroad and at home without
dimming our core principles," Gore said. "Indeed, I believe that our
success in defending ourselves depends precisely on not giving up
what we stand for."</TE>
<TE>   Gore's remarks in a 7 1/2-page speech to the Commonwealth Club in
San Francisco were a dramatic departure from the low-profile, almost
reclusive stance he has adopted since Bush captured the White House
after the disputed 2000 election. Over the last few weeks, he was the
only one of the major Democratic presidential prospects to keep his
own counsel on the U.S. confrontation with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   When he finally spoke up, the severity of his tone and the
prominence of his platform--a speech aired to a national radio
audience--served only to intensify speculation on whether he will try
another run for office in 2004. Gore teased the audience by saying he
would make his decision by year's end based on "all kinds of
sophisticated" calculations, "often referred to by the scientific
label 'gut feeling.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Commonwealth Club, a Bay Area civic affairs organization,
presented a traditionally nonpartisan forum. But the political
overtones--and lingering Democratic resentment over the 2000
campaign--suffused the gilded hotel ballroom.</TE>
<TE>   As the former vice president stepped to the microphone, a group in
the fourth row took up an a cappella version of "Hail to the
Chief"--Gore smiled--and his 45-minute speech was repeatedly
interrupted by cheers and applause. One woman wore a T-shirt with the
2000 "Bush-Cheney" logo rendered to read "Bush Cheated." Another
waved a sign saying "Al Gore is my president."</TE>
<TE>   Asked the inevitable question at the close of his remarks, Gore
said he would make a decision in December on whether to seek the
Democratic nomination to challenge Bush in 2004. Still, the day's
events had the look and feel of the campaign high season, enhanced by
a rapid response from the Republican National Committee in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't surprise me that Al Gore doesn't recognize leadership
when he sees it," said Mindy Tucker, a GOP spokeswoman. "He is
somebody who, on important issues like foreign policy, in the past
has made decisions based on political goals rather than what's best
for America."</TE>
<TE>   Reading his speech like a prosecutor's brief, his voice rising,
Gore urged Congress to reject the expansive authority and quick
approval Bush has sought in dealing with Iraq, saying the president
"should be urged to take the time to assemble the broadest possible
international support" before he pursues any military action.</TE>
<TE>   And Gore challenged the strategic doctrine Bush laid out last
week, saying the asserted right to unilateral action against
suspected terrorists and rogue nations could encourage other nations
"to exert the same right."</TE>
<TE>   "Then the rule of law would quickly be replaced by the reign of
fear," Gore said.</TE>
<TE>   While striking in its evident disdain for the president, Gore's
speech was also notable for separating him from many fellow
Democrats, including his 2000 running mate, Connecticut Sen. Joseph
I. Lieberman.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman and several party peers also considering a race against
Bush have voiced varying degrees of support for the president's Iraq
policy, or at least seem likely to come around to the
administration's position. An exception is Vermont Gov. Howard Dean,
but his skepticism has been muffled compared with the full-throated
attack that Gore leveled on Monday. Afterward, leading Democrats
declined to comment on Gore's speech.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, spokesman Scott McClellan alluded to those
differences. "The president has united the nation and the nation has
rallied behind his call for action," McClellan said. "He will
continue to lead and unite America, even if splits begin to emerge in
the Democratic Party and its candidates." In 1991, then-U.S. Sen.
Gore was one of just 10 Democrats to support Bush's father, then
president, and vote for military action against Saddam Hussein after
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The vote was one of the reasons Bill
Clinton chose Gore as his running mate in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Gore said Monday he continues to view Hussein as a menace to his
Persian Gulf neighbors, but does not view the Iraqi president as an
imminent threat to the United States. For that reason, Gore said, he
opposed a unilateral attack, which could estrange America's allies
and undermine their support for the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "In the case of Iraq, it would be more difficult for the United
States to succeed alone, but still possible," Gore said. By contrast,
he went on, the war on terrorism requires "broad and continuous
international cooperation" that could be "severely damaged by
unilateral action against Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Gore's dissent represented a political gamble of sorts, coming at
a time when polls show strong public support for ousting Hussein. But
his remarks should dispel the criticism of fellow Democrats who say
he has been too deferential toward Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Gore could tap a vein of underlying anxiety that has
developed around the administration's assertively independent foreign
policy.</TE>
<TE>   "Most Americans like the United Nations," said Benjamin Page, a
Northwestern University expert on public opinion and foreign policy.
"A lot of Americans are bothered about the notion of going it alone."</TE>
<TE>   In perhaps his most incendiary remarks, Gore suggested that Bush
was coaxing the American people toward war with Iraq to compensate
for the country's failings in "the war against Osama bin Laden."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we should allow anything to diminish our focus on
the necessity for avenging the 3,000 Americans who were murdered" on
Sept. 11, 2001, and "dismantling the network of terrorists that we
know were responsible for it," Gore said. "The fact that we don't
know where they are should not cause us to focus instead on some
other enemy whose location may be easier to identify."</TE>
<TE>   By shifting the focus to Iraq--before even stabilizing the
situation in Afghanistan--Gore asserted that Bush has drained
international goodwill and filled the world with fear "not primarily
about what the terrorist networks are gonna do, [but] what about what
we're gonna do."</TE>
<TE>   "Squandering all that goodwill and replacing it with anxiety in a
year's time is similar to what was done by turning a $100-billion
surplus into a $200-billion deficit," Gore added, a jibe that drew a
roar from the heavily partisan crowd of several hundred.</TE>
<TE>   Gore suggested Bush has politicized the conflict with Iraq to
boost Republican prospects in the Nov. 5 election and to "please the
portion of his base that occupies the far right."</TE>
<TE>   "The president is on the campaign trail two or three days a week,
often publicly taunting Democrats with the political consequences of
a 'no' vote" in Congress, Gore said. "The Republican National
Committee is running pre-packaged advertising based on the same.</TE>
<TE>   "Vice President [Dick] Cheney, meanwhile, has indignantly
described suggestions of [political motivation] as reprehensible. And
then the following week [he] took his discussion of the war to the
Rush Limbaugh show." (Cheney's appearance, scheduled to observe the
anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, was in fact canceled.)</TE>
<TE>   Gore compared Bush with his father, noting that the senior Bush
had waited until after the midterm elections of 1990 to schedule a
congressional vote on the Persian Gulf War. But Gore also criticized
the elder Bush, saying he "felt betrayed by the first Bush
administration's hasty departure from the battlefield" in 1991, which
kept Hussein in power after the war.</TE>

<DH>U.S. seeks to prosecute two of its pilots in bombing that
killed four Canadians in Afghan war. At home, there's a sense they're
'fall guys.'</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two pilots were alone in the dark battling fatigue, battling
fear, scouting an enemy that seemed to mass and melt away in the
shadows of the hostile land beneath.</LD>
<LD>   Wedged into the cockpits of their F-16s, they raced through a
moonless midnight, a routine overnight patrol southwest of Kandahar.
They swallowed "Go Pills," stimulants prescribed by the Air Force to
keep them alert. On they flew, on and on, for hours, on and on,
alone.</LD>
<LD>   Then, from below: A flash.</LD>
<TE>   The arc of tracer fire. Balls of flame that looked to be coming
right at them.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Harry Schmidt called mission controllers cruising the region
in a radar plane to report surface-to-air fire. He asked permission
to strafe the ground with his cannon. "Stand by," the controller told
him. "Hold fire."</TE>
<TE>   Flash. Flash. Schmidt reduced speed and swept lower. He squinted
through his night-vision goggles.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got some men on a road and it looks like a piece of
artillery firing at us," he reported, according to transcripts
released by an inquiry board. "I am rolling in, in self-defense."</TE>
<TE>   He readied his 500-pound laser-guided bomb. "Bombs away," he
announced, and dropped it, right on target. At that very moment, a
ground commander radioed the radar plane: "Kandahar has
friendlies.... Get [the F-16s] out of there."</TE>
<TE>   As he pulled up and soared away, Schmidt radioed the pilot in the
other fighter jet: "I hope that was the right thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   The bomb Schmidt dropped killed four Canadian soldiers and wounded
eight as they engaged in live-fire training on Afghanistan's Tarnak
Farms range on April 18. A military inquiry has recommended charging
Schmidt with involuntary manslaughter, aggravated assault and
dereliction of duty. If convicted, he could face up to 64 years in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot in the companion F-16, Maj. William Umbach, has been
accused of the same criminal offenses.</TE>
<TE>   Though he did not drop the bomb, Umbach was serving as flight
commander, in charge of the mission. He too could face 64 years.</TE>
<TE>   It is the first time the U.S. military has recommended criminal
charges for wartime "friendly fire." In taking that step, authorities
said the pilots acted recklessly and violated rules governing use of
force in Operation Enduring Freedom. Critics, however, have suggested
the Air Force caved to political and diplomatic pressure from
incensed Canadians.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to prosecute has roiled the pilots' hometowns of
Sherman and Petersburg--small rural communities in central Illinois
decked out in American flags. In more than two dozen interviews there
last week, the outrage was unanimous.</TE>
<TE>   "They should leave those pilots alone," said Angela Marvel, 36,
indignant as she shopped for children's clothes. "It was an accident.
Accidents happen all the time."</TE>
<TE>   "They're over there flying for our country. They're fighting our
war.... And now, they're the fall guys," said John Russo, 71,
commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars post in nearby Springfield.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're traveling 6 miles per minute in a fighter and you
look down and see firing, you don't have a lot of time to make the
right decision," said state Rep. Raymond Poe, a Republican. "Everyone
around here feels, if we were up there, we probably would have done
the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt and Umbach served with the Illinois Air National Guard's
183rd Fighter Wing, based in Springfield.</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt, 37, a celebrated Top Gun pilot, was a full-time
guardsman, the pride of his squadron. In fact, the Springfield
fighter wing had courted him for months, eager to land a pilot
described by both his peers and his superiors as "well above
average."</TE>
<TE>   A former instructor at the Navy Fighter Weapons School, he had
more than 3,200 hours of military flying time.</TE>
<TE>   Umbach, 43, a commercial airline pilot, was a traditional
part-time guardsman, training on weekends. Logging 3,000 hours of
military flying time over two decades, he had earned a rating as one
of the Air Force's most experienced pilots. Shaken by the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, he volunteered for deployment overseas and had
been flying sorties nearly every other day for a month before the
bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Holding court over a 7-Up at the Springfield VFW, Army veteran
Jerry Helfrich called the pilots' prosecution "a travesty."</TE>
<TE>   Through thick cigarette smoke, his buddies grunted assent. After
all, they pointed out, friendly fire has torn up battlefields in
every major conflict--and it has always been considered a tragedy,
not a crime.</TE>
<TE>   Confederate Gen. Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson was fatally wounded by
one of his own men during the Civil War. U.S. bombers in World War II
accidentally killed the American general in charge of Army ground
forces--and 110 of his soldiers--as they prepared for the D-Day
invasion.</TE>
<TE>   In the Persian Gulf War a decade ago, 35 of 146 Americans who
died--nearly 25%--were killed by friendly fire. During the campaign
in Afghanistan, U.S. airstrikes mistakenly have killed more than
1,000 civilians, including dozens at a July wedding in a remote
village. And four months before the Canadian deaths at Tarnak Farms,
a B-52 dropped a bomb directly on U.S. forces near Kandahar, killing
three Green Berets and at least two dozen Afghan allies.</TE>
<TE>   "War is ugly. War is nasty. War is cruel. These things happen,"
said Russo, an Army veteran who said he was strafed accidentally by
the U.S. Marines during the Korean War.</TE>
<TE>   He has started a legal defense fund for the pilots. Illinois Gov.
George Ryan, also a veteran, has urged folks to contribute.</TE>
<TE>   "If Maj. Schmidt felt he was in imminent danger, then that's what
he thought," Russo said. "I'm not going to pass judgment on him. And
no one else should either."</TE>
<TE>   After exhaustive investigations, American and Canadian panels
determined that multiple errors contributed to the tragedy, from a
breakdown in flight discipline to poor mission planning to "peer
pressure" on Schmidt to "build credibility for [his] squadron" and
prove his skill in combat after weeks of flying uneventful sorties
over Iraq and Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition Board of Inquiry, the joint U.S.-Canadian panel that
backed criminal charges against the pilots, found that Schmidt
"misperceived the caliber, trajectory and distance traveled of the
munitions"--which were not, in fact, aimed skyward at the F-16, but
were rather fired along the ground in a drill that posed no threat to
the planes.</TE>
<TE>   When Schmidt first spotted the flares, the proper course of action
would have been to accelerate, climb and leave the area, the board
concluded. Instead, Schmidt slowed down, descended to well within
range of any surface-to-air projectiles, and circled around his
perceived enemy.</TE>
<TE>   That was a direct violation of standing rules of engagement, which
stated that "aircraft should NOT deliberately descend into [the range
of anti-aircraft artillery] to engage and destroy."</TE>
<TE>   Rather than waiting for controllers to check whether friendly
forces were in the area--a process that involved querying commanders
on the ground--Schmidt invoked self-defense almost immediately. Less
than two minutes elapsed between his first report of anti-aircraft
fire and his "bombs away" call.</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt later told his superiors he felt an imminent threat; he
believed the unidentified figures on the ground were targeting
Umbach's plane. Yet the board found no evidence that he had alerted
Umbach to the presumed danger. Umbach himself apparently did not
think he was in peril. He took no evasive action and did not request
permission to use his weapons.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Canadian transcripts show that minutes after the bomb
drop, Umbach radioed controllers in the distant radar plane with a
question they could not possibly answer: "Can you confirm that they
were shooting at us?"</TE>
<TE>   Two minutes later, Schmidt reassured him: "They were definitely
shooting at you."</TE>
<TE>   "It sure seemed that they were tracking [the planes] around,"
Umbach replied.</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt then tried to explain what he had seen through his
night-vision goggles that provoked such a swift and lethal response.
"I had a group of guys on a road around a gun," he said, "and it did
not look organized like it would be [if it were] our guys."</TE>
<TE>   The joint U.S.-Canadian inquiry concluded that even if those "guys
on a road" had been the enemy, dropping a 500-pound bomb would have
been an inappropriate response for such a small target.</TE>
<TE>   The board faulted Umbach, a veteran with 20 years of military
experience, for failing to halt or delay the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   After the first sighting of flashes from the ground, he did radio
a warning to Schmidt: "Let's just make sure that it's not
friendlies." But he did not query mission controllers about allied
forces in the area, did not direct Schmidt to withdraw to a safe
altitude and did not even confirm that he and Schmidt were looking at
the same target.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, they weren't. Discussing the location of the
presumed enemy on the radio moments after the bombing, Umbach said:
"It seems like it was right on a bridge. That's kind of where I was
at."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, not quite," Schmidt replied. And then, after a pause: "I
hope that was the right thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   "Me too," Umbach answered.</TE>
<TE>   The inquiry board concluded "by clear and convincing evidence,"
that it was not right, that the pilots "acted with reckless disregard
for the foreseeable consequences of [their] actions." Air Force brass
have not elaborated, letting the lengthy report speak for itself.</TE>
<TE>   The officers have not responded publicly since the charges were
filed against them Sept. 13. Their attorneys, however, maintain that
the men honestly--and reasonably--believed they were under attack.</TE>
<TE>   The pilots "were required to make split-second, life-or-death
decisions without benefit of detached and calm reflection," said
Schmidt's attorney, Charles Gittins.</TE>
<TE>   Without disputing the facts laid out in the board's report, the
lawyers insist that the pilots acted appropriately in self-defense.
And they argue that personnel involved in planning, coordinating and
controlling the mission bear significant responsibility for what
happened.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the joint U.S.-Canadian board found that multiple mistakes
were made outside the F-16 cockpits.</TE>
<TE>   The fighter squadron Schmidt and Umbach were assigned to in
Afghanistan did not have a consistent policy for briefing pilots on
what they might encounter. Pilots did not get up-to-date maps showing
airspace restrictions or military activity on the ground and had
"insufficient information to execute their assigned mission," the
board found.</TE>
<TE>   In a fatal breakdown of communication, controllers in the radar
plane apparently did not know that the Canadians would be training
near Kandahar that evening, even though the Canadians had filed
appropriate information a week in advance. The pilots also had no
information about the nighttime exercise.</TE>
<TE>   And Col. David Nichols, the pilots' commander, "bred a climate of
mistrust" within his squadron that led his men to doubt the mission
controllers assigned to approve their use of force, the board found.</TE>
<TE>   Though the U.S. military inquiry concluded that there were
failures at many levels before and during the disastrous mission,
only the pilots were recommended for court-martial. The panel
stipulated non-judicial punishment for Nichols; his case is pending.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Schmidt and Umbach have been ordered to report to
Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana for an Article 32 hearing,
similar to a civilian grand jury proceeding. At the hearing, which
could open as early as next month, military authorities will present
the case against the officers; their lawyers will offer their
defense.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Gen. Bruce Carlson, commander of the 8th Air Force, will then
decide whether there is enough evidence to court-martial the pilots
on the most serious charges. He could also dismiss the case
altogether or press ahead with lesser charges that would bring short
jail sentences, fines or bad-conduct discharges for the pilots.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Charges of Scapegoating</TE>
<TE>   In central Illinois, in conversation after conversation, one word
ricochets with bitter force:</TE>
<TE>   Scapegoat.</TE>
<TE>   "[These] are two of the finest pilots and Americans I've come
across in my 12-plus years of service," said Staff Sgt. William
Kaltenbach, an F-16 crew chief who serves with Schmidt and Umbach.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unfortunate," he said, that the tragedy has largely been
blamed on the pilots alone "when a mission is planned, coordinated
and executed by so many more."</TE>
<TE>   Among civilians and soldiers alike, there is widespread grumbling
that the pilots were singled out to appease the Canadian government.
There are angry whispers that the Pentagon is going after the little
guys to deflect attention from a major lapse in command-and-control.</TE>
<TE>   The pilots "appear to be at risk of being treated as diplomatic
pawns and scapegoats," Springfield's State Journal-Register said in
an editorial last week. "We are frankly flabbergasted by the severity
of the military's response.... This is not the My Lai massacre--this
is a horrible mistake. Could it have been prevented? Certainly. But
does the sole responsibility rest with these pilots? Absolutely not."</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt's attorney has suggested that the criminal charges may be
motivated by "an inappropriate political agenda." Even some of the
victims' relatives in Canada have expressed concern that the pilots
are being treated too harshly.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not interested in revenge," the father of one of the slain
soldiers told a Canadian newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want [Schmidt] to go to prison," said the grandmother of
another victim.</TE>
<TE>   One expert in international law predicts that Schmidt and Umbach
will not face the maximum penalty and may well avoid a court-martial
altogether. A trial "could give the Pentagon a black eye" because it
would air testimony about other failures in Operation Enduring
Freedom, said Francis A. Boyle, a law professor at the University of
Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, Boyle said, "if it got to a formal court-martial with a jury
of their peers, my guess is they would stand a good chance of
acquittal."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the pilots avoid prison, the criminal accusations have
derailed their careers, burdened them with legal bills--and set a
precedent that deeply troubles many military personnel.</TE>
<TE>   "We must be allowed the freedom to make split-second decisions,
for lives depend on it," said firefighter Kevin Schott, who serves
with the accused pilots in the 183rd Fighter Wing.</TE>
<TE>   "We always hope and pray that the decisions we make are the right
ones," Schott said. "[But] we will never eliminate mistakes. I will
stand proud and tall to salute Maj. Umbach and Maj. Schmidt."</TE>

<HD>Raiders Get New Trial Against NFL</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge Monday awarded the Oakland Raiders a new trial in their
$1.2-billion lawsuit against the National Football League. The ruling
may once again inject the team into calculations involving the future
of professional football in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The Raiders had sued the league, alleging that they "own" the L.A.
market, and Monday's ruling figures to complicate and delay efforts
to persuade another NFL team to move here.</LD>
<LD>   The NFL prevailed after a lengthy trial in the spring of 2001, but
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Richard C. Hubbell ruled that the
Raiders are entitled to a new trial because of juror misconduct
during deliberations.</LD>
<TE>   Two incidents of juror misconduct stood out. One juror, according
to legal papers filed in the case, repeatedly told the others that he
hated the Raiders and owner Al Davis, and would "never find for the
Raiders." Another wrote out on butcher paper "statements of law for
the jury to refer to and use," and taped them to the wall--a
violation of the basic rule that jurors get the law in a case from
the judge only.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a just and correct ruling," Raiders chief executive Amy
Trask said late Monday. "A number of jurors stepped forward and told
our lawyers that, were it not for the misconduct, we would have won
that trial." She paused, then added, "The NFL was celebrating too
soon."</TE>
<TE>   NFL Vice President Joe Browne said, "We're disappointed. But we'll
discuss the decision with the lawyers during the next few days."</TE>
<TE>   The league has the option of appealing Monday's ruling to a state
appeals court in Los Angeles. Allen Ruby, the league's chief trial
attorney, said of Monday's decision, "Everybody's looking at it and
thinking about it."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling was made amid uncertainty about prospects for the
return of the NFL to Los Angeles. In recent months, there have been
developments, but no concrete action, leaving Los Angeles in the same
place the nation's second-largest city has been in since 1995, when
the Raiders and the Los Angeles Rams left town. The Rams relocated in
St. Louis. The ruling could well add years to what has already been a
drawn-out process--particularly if the case does go to trial again,
because it would take months to get to that point and any verdict
would undoubtedly be appealed.</TE>
<TE>   In Monday's order, Hubbell fixed a Dec. 3 hearing to set a new
trial date.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to show up on Dec. 3 to ask for a trial date as soon
as we can go to trial," Raiders attorney Larry Feldman said.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL and, in particular, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue have made
it plain that--given the right financial considerations--the league
would love to return to Los Angeles. The league covets L.A. as a site
for Super Bowls and, besides being the nation's No. 2 TV market, this
is the U.S. corporate home of the Fox TV network, one of the NFL's
television partners.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. almost got an expansion franchise in 1999--a team that would
have played at the Coliseum--but was outbid by Houston billionaire
Bob McNair, who paid a $700-million franchise fee for a team now
called the Houston Texans. The Texans began NFL play this season.</TE>
<TE>   League officials have long maintained that the court case
involving the Raiders played no role in expansion plans.</TE>
<TE>   A number of teams with diminishing local revenue would appear to
be candidates to move to Los Angeles. Among them are the San Diego
Chargers, Indianapolis Colts and Minnesota Vikings.</TE>
<TE>   The primary roadblock, however, is that there's no facility in the
area that would serve the interests of an NFL that has grown reliant
in recent years on stadiums, new or renovated, that include such
revenue producers as luxury boxes and naming-rights fees.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, a group backed by Denver billionaire Philip
Anschutz proposed building a football stadium next to Staples Center.
That group pulled out in June after encountering stepped-up
competition from the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Interests backing the Coliseum have said in recent weeks that they
are intrigued by the redevelopment of Chicago's Soldier Field--a
possible blueprint for renovation of the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Several NFL executives and team owners have said bluntly, however,
that they have no interest in returning to the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the Pasadena City Council approved the hiring of John
Moag, chairman of a Maryland sports investment banking firm, to
assemble a financial plan aimed at promoting the Rose Bowl as a
potential site. Moag helped broker the deal that, in the mid-1990s,
took the Cleveland Browns to Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Superior Court case involving the Raiders centers
on the team's claim that the NFL undermined the Raiders' plans to
play in a proposed new stadium at Hollywood Park and that the
team--which played in L.A. from 1982 to 1994--still "owned" the NFL's
rights to the Los Angeles market.</TE>
<TE>   After an 11-week trial that included frequent references to the
longtime enmity between Raiders owner Davis and the league, a jury on
May 21, 2001, ruled in the NFL's favor. The vote was 9 to 3. One more
vote for the Raiders would have resulted in a hung jury.</TE>
<TE>   The jury vote seemed to kill any hope the Raiders had of returning
here.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling Monday revives that possibility.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling, said one NFL insider, speaking on condition of
anonymity, "adds a complication. But at the end of the day, whoever
it is has to have a place to play that's economically viable. And I'm
not aware of that being the case now."</TE>
<TE>   Davis and the Raiders also have a second $1-billion lawsuit
currently in the courts, a case against the city of Oakland and
Alameda County that claims he was promised capacity crowds that have
not materialized.</TE>
<TE>   A trial date has been pushed back to next year.</TE>
<TE>   A win in the case conceivably could give the Raiders leverage to
get out of their Oakland lease, which runs until 2011.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the ill will between the Raiders and the league dates to
the early 1980s, when the team beat the league in court in an
antitrust case--giving the team legal validation for its move to L.A.
from its original home in Oakland.</TE>

<KH>J.A. Adande</KH>
<HD>Clippers Doing Same Old Dot Con</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>... Normally you don't see the dots at the start of a sentence, but
that's the way things will begin for the Clippers this season.</LD>
<LD>   ... They'll start training camp next week in much the same manner
they started the summer, with the long-term status of the franchise
up in the air, unresolved, to be continued....</LD>
<LD>   Every step forward also brings them a step closer to the abyss. On
Monday the Clippers proceeded with the formality of signing center
Michael Olowokandi to a one-year tender offer of $6.1 million. That
means they missed a chance to sign him to a long-term contract, and
he'll become an unrestricted free agent next year.</LD>
<TE>   Also, a team official added to the growing feeling that Elton
Brand won't sign a contract extension before the Oct. 31 deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very possible that we will put off that issue until next
summer," Clipper Vice President Andy Roeser said.</TE>
<TE>   It's not as if this off-season has been a waste. The Clippers
completed what Roeser called a "massive upgrade" of the point guard
position by trading for Andre Miller and signing Yugoslavian Marko
Jaric, a 2000 draft pick.</TE>
<TE>   But they didn't progress in making the major financial statement
we've been waiting to see, the big put-up that would make everyone
shut up.</TE>
<TE>   They're willing to go with the status quo for another year, with
the understanding that great individual seasons could raise the
asking prices.</TE>
<TE>   And that's what they're risking--individual seasons. With
Olowokandi, Brand, Miller, Lamar Odom, Corey Maggette, Eric
Piatkowski, Quentin Richardson, Keyon Dooling and Sean Rooks eligible
for some type of contract discussions next year, you could be looking
at a different agenda for practically every player stepping on the
court. How would you like to be Alvin Gentry, with some player's
agent calling to complain each time the coach took someone out of the
game?</TE>
<TE>   The safest way to take at least some of the edge off this season
would have been to sign Brand. One source said Brand would have taken
less than max money to stay with the Clippers. If a $70-million offer
could have sealed it, it should already be done.</TE>
<TE>   There's little downside. He's going to average 19 points and 10
rebounds, he's going to stay out of trouble. And by signing him,
Donald Sterling could have pressed the mute button on all of those
who say he'll never commit the serious paper.</TE>
<TE>   Wouldn't a little peace and quiet be worth it?</TE>
<TE>   Instead, we hear a lot of the same noise--including the same
promises from the Clippers, which have yet to come with a
money-backed guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   "We will do what we have to do to keep this nucleus together,"
Roeser said. "Next summer we will reward all our players consistent
to their contributions to our team's success this season."</TE>
<TE>   Technically, the Clippers still have the capability of bringing
everyone on this team back for at least one more season after this
one. That's not the realistic expectation. As one observer said of
Olowokandi's future in L.A.: "This is it and they know it."</TE>
<TE>   Those weren't the terms Olowokandi's agent used.</TE>
<TE>   "It keeps Michael in a situation that we're currently comfortable
with," Bill Duffy said of the one-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   "His objective is to win and to continue to improve. He
understands that and accepts that. In this business, at some point
the team has choices and at later points the player has choices."</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations on a long-term deal weren't acrimonious, but the
sides were far apart.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept making reference to Mike Bibby's contract," said Duffy,
referring to the seven-year, $80.5-million deal Bibby signed with the
Kings. "I don't think they saw Michael at that level."</TE>
<TE>   The Clipper numbers would have topped out at an average salary
$8.5 million (if all incentives were reached) per year, while Duffy
wanted a deal more like $11.5 million per year.</TE>
<TE>   I believe $60 million in guaranteed money would have been more
than fair for a guy who's never played in the All-Star game. But I've
heard the Clippers didn't even get to that number.</TE>
<TE>   If Olowokandi delivers on the promise he showed last season and
starts playing his way out of the Clippers' price range, they can't
get a return on his improved stock because players can't be traded in
the midst of a one-year contract. So they'll either pay up or lose
him as a free agent.</TE>
<TE>   We could have a repeat of that scenario next year with Brand,
Odom, Miller and Maggette, the members of the 1999 draft class.
They'll become restricted free agents after the season, giving the
Clippers the option to match any offer they receive elsewhere, sign
them to a long-term deal or offer them a one-year contract at a 30%
raise.</TE>
<TE>   This was a bad year to be a free agent, because the salary cap
actually dropped, to $40.271 million. It is expected to stay around
the same next year, and the luxury tax threshold--the point at which
teams have to pay a dollar-for-dollar penalty if they exceed
it--should be around $52.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   More teams should have salary cap space available, however, as
some of the big contracts from the free-spending summer of 1996
finally terminate.</TE>
<TE>   Where does that leave the Clippers?</TE>
<TE>   "It's only Chapter 5 of a 10-chapter book," Duffy said. "They've
got to deal with that."</TE>
<TE>   He had a suggestion for how to finish this chapter.</TE>
<TE>   "The periods ... what's it called?"</TE>
<TE>   Ellipsis.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, ellipsis."</TE>

<HD>Wait Till This Year</HD>
<DH>A patient general manager goes a long way for Angels</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He sits in the front row, right behind home plate, for every Cactus
League game at the Angels' spring home in Arizona. He wears a
wide-brim hat to shield himself from the relentless sun.</LD>
<LD>   A few fans might recognize him. Most scurry past, rushing to flag
down the guy selling the cold drinks.</LD>
<LD>   He is the most anonymous general manager in baseball, which is
just the way he likes it.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't get bugged in restaurants," Bill Stoneman says.</TE>
<TE>   And then he laughs, because the Angels' general manager, the
architect of baseball's most remarkable success story this season,
scouts his restaurants as carefully as he does his players.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally," he says, "I don't go to the restaurants where there
are a lot of people anyway. I like little quaint places."</TE>
<TE>   That description would not apply to Yankee Stadium, where the
Angels are likely to open the playoffs next Tuesday, in their first
postseason game in 16 years, as the wild-card entry in an American
League playoff field that includes the Yankees, Oakland Athletics and
Minnesota Twins.</TE>
<TE>   The A's are run by Billy Beane, all but granted an honorary PhD in
a glowing New Yorker magazine profile that compared his insights in
statistical analysis to Warren Buffett's insights in financial
analysis.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees are run by Brian Cashman, either George Steinbrenner's
boy wonder or whipping boy, depending whether the Yankees are on a
two-game winning streak or a two-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins are run by Terry Ryan, a low-profile guy who nonetheless
drew national acclaim for developing a championship team at the same
time his owner would just as soon have folded the team.</TE>
<TE>   But all those teams posted winning records last season. After
finishing 41 games out of first place last year, the Angels will
finish this year with the best record in franchise history. Oakland
Manager Art Howe recently wondered, only half jokingly, if anyone
knew who the Angel general manager was.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the job is to be high-profile," says Stoneman, 58.
"I think the job is to put the best club on the field and let the
fans focus on the club. Nobody buys a ticket to come and see the
general manager."</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia earns raves, and rightfully so. He's
the trendy candidate for the manager-of-the-year award. But seldom do
you hear about Stoneman, the guy who hired him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's done a great job," Beane said. "He probably doesn't get
enough credit. Bill's a background kind of guy."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels almost lost Stoneman before they could hire him. In
1999, after Bill Bavasi resigned, then-president Tony Tavares settled
on Stoneman as his successor. Then Disney Chairman Michael Eisner
ordered another round of interviews. In the 10 days between the time
Tavares thought he had hired Stoneman and the time he actually did,
Stoneman wondered whether he ought to keep his job with the Montreal
Expos and walk away from the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "I almost did," he says. "Somebody back in Montreal said, 'Just
relax.' It was good advice."</TE>
<TE>   That Stoneman would heed a suggestion to be patient is not at all
surprising. He preaches patience, and he practices it.</TE>
<TE>   Not long before he hired Stoneman, in the wake of the Angels'
worst season in 16 years, Tavares had bellowed, "Why not?" to the
question of whether the Angels could trade all 25 players.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman took a deep breath. The Angels' core of position players
was too good to blow up, he decided. The maligned minor league system
assembled by Bavasi was good enough to produce pitchers Jarrod
Washburn, Ramon Ortiz and Scott Schoeneweis, all of whom Stoneman
moved into the starting rotation, rather than sign stopgap veterans.</TE>
<TE>   Fans screamed. Columnists and talk-show hosts screamed. Stoneman
shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   "From a management standpoint, that's an attribute," Tavares said.
"He just kind of chuckles and says, that's their opinion. A lot of
people--including me--don't react the same way."</TE>
<TE>   In an industry that Tavares said is plagued by "a lot of
cronyism," Stoneman did not fill his front office with old Montreal
associates. He solicited recommendations from inside and outside the
Angel organization.</TE>
<TE>   Said Scioscia: "I just knew him as a guy who threw a couple of
no-hitters." (He did, for the Expos, in 1969 and 1972.)</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman retained the top scouts and acquired several little-known
players upon their recommendations--shortstop David Eckstein,
reliever Brendan Donnelly and backup catcher Jose Molina, brother of
starting catcher Bengie Molina.</TE>
<TE>   Says Stoneman, "I didn't even know Bengie Molina had a brother."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Ron Roenicke recommended another reliever, Ben Weber. Second
baseman Adam Kennedy came from St. Louis in the trade for outfielder
Jim Edmonds. Washburn and Ortiz flourished after two years of
on-the-job training, and the minor league system polished John Lackey
to replace the inconsistent Schoeneweis, who prospered after his move
to the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   The core of the offense--outfielders Garret Anderson, Darin Erstad
and Tim Salmon and third baseman Troy Glaus--remained, as did closer
Troy Percival.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman supplemented the talent last winter with pitchers Kevin
Appier and Aaron Sele and designated hitter Brad Fullmer, and players
and coaches believed the Angels finally had a winner.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Angels got off to their worst start, losing 14 of their
first 20 games. Even so, Stoneman remained patient. No firings, no
scapegoats, no getting rid of the manager or the batting coach to "do
something."</TE>
<TE>   "You never see any kind of panic on his face, through the good and
the bad," batting coach Mickey Hatcher said. "If we have to worry
what management is thinking about, it's tough to coach like that....
But he maintained a great attitude, and we all did."</TE>
<TE>   Said Scioscia: "He brings an incredible amount of stability to
what at times is a fragile business."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia is the first Angel manager to survive three full seasons
since Gene Mauch did so from 1985 to '87. The Angels last year
extended Scioscia's contract through 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman's contract expires next year. With Disney trying to sell
the club, Stoneman resisted possible temptation to trade the Angels'
top prospects for proven stars who might enhance the chance to win
this year and thus impress a possible new boss.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to sell out your future to take a run for one
year," he says. "That's a little bit short-sighted. If you live in
fear of losing your job, you're probably not going to do a very good
job."</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman says there have been no talks about a contract extension
and that he is "not even thinking about that."</TE>
<TE>   Angel President Paul Pressler declined to discuss that issue but
said, "The two most important reasons we are where we are are Bill
Stoneman and Mike Scioscia."</TE>
<TE>   If Stoneman were talking about a contract extension, he would no
sooner discuss the details than he would sing karaoke before a
sellout crowd at Edison Field. He is unfailingly pleasant, but ask
him to talk about a trade rumor or his interest in an available free
agent, and his response ranges from reluctance to refusal.</TE>
<TE>   You don't hear much about what Stoneman is up to because he won't
tell. Many major league executives don't mind sharing information on
potential trades and signings with fellow executives and the media,
in part to fuel a fan buzz about the sport.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman calls the content of trade talks "our private corporate
information" and believes rival teams should behave accordingly. Two
years ago, he said, the Yankees did not, during trade talks about
Edmonds.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the conversations I would have would appear in a New York
paper the next day, and I grew tired of it," Stoneman says. "I picked
up the phone and told the Yankees, 'We are not going to talk to you
about Jim Edmonds, because we can't seem to have a private
conversation.' "</TE>
<TE>   In a private conversation with outfielder Tim Salmon last year,
Stoneman outlined his plan to turn the Angels into winners. Salmon,
the Angels' all-time home run leader, had squirmed when Stoneman
traded Edmonds and abandoned pitcher Chuck Finley, the Angels'
all-time victory leader, to free agency.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman offered Salmon a four-year contract extension, and Salmon
wasn't sure whether to sign. Stoneman had come from Montreal, after
all, where the Expos developed talented young players, then dumped
them before they became too expensive. Salmon wondered whether he
would be the lone veteran in a clubhouse full of kids happy just to
be there.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman assured Salmon the budget was bigger in Anaheim than in
Montreal. The Angels would not sign the most expensive free agents,
but they would retain their own players, invest in player development
and international scouting, supplement with free agents when
necessary and promote young players on the basis of talent, not
salary. And they would play for a championship.</TE>
<TE>   "He came across as very straightforward and trusting," Salmon
said.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon signed the extension. The Angels did retain their potential
free agents, with Erstad and Percival following him in signing
extensions. They did supplement their roster, boosting the payroll to
add Appier, Sele and Fullmer. They did develop and promote young
talent, including Lackey and the Venezuelan phenom, reliever
Francisco Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon made his major league debut in 1992. No current major
leaguer has played more games without a playoff appearance--1,383 and
counting, but he can stop counting this week.</TE>
<TE>   Bound for Yankee Stadium, Salmon pauses to tip his cap to
Stoneman.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything he told me," Salmon said, "has happened."</TE>

<DH>Dodgers: Two games back in wild-card race with six to play,
resilient team has back to wall and patchwork rotation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers enter the bell lap of the National League wild-card race
tonight with their rotation in tatters, the San Francisco Giants
still setting the pace and only the winner advancing.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco has a two-game lead as the clubs sprint to the
finish in the final week of the regular season, turning up the heat
on the Dodgers, who have only six games remaining against the
Colorado Rockies and San Diego Padres at Dodger Stadium. They're in a
tough spot and could make excuses with starters Kazuhisa Ishii and
Kevin Brown sidelined and others struggling, but that's not the
Dodgers' style.</LD>
<LD>   The resilient bunch is still in the race despite its pitching
problems and won't change course now.</LD>
<TE>   "Everyone knows what's happened with our pitching, and it would be
really easy to kind of point to that, but no one on this team has
given up and said we can't do it," catcher Paul Lo Duca said. "There
were times it looked like we were going in the wrong direction and
that might be it, but we didn't let that happen.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what, we just keep going, and that's the difference in
this year's team, because of the guys we have here now. You want to
be in a position to make these last games count, and we're still in
that position. Sure, you wish you had all your guys healthy, but
we're focused on what we have to do."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have to keep winning and hope the Giants stumble at
least twice in their final five games against the Padres and Houston
Astros at Pacific Bell Park.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Manager Jim Tracy is relying on Hideo Nomo and Odalis Perez
to hold together a makeshift rotation, hoping to get to the playoffs
and worry later about who would pitch against the East division
champion Atlanta Braves.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to get there first," Tracy said. "If we had all our
horses it would be better than it is right now, there's no doubt
about it, but it is what it is."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants have only five games scheduled this week but would have
to play the Braves in a makeup game Monday at Turner Field if that
game has a bearing on the wild-card race. An Aug. 15 Giant-Brave game
was called because of rain with the score tied, 3-3, in the 10th
inning.</TE>
<TE>   But the Dodgers aren't looking that far ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't look to help from San Diego and Houston, and we sure
can't think about what could happen if everything else goes right for
us," center fielder Marquis Grissom said. "Plain and simple, you have
to keep your focus on your job and what you've got to do here.</TE>
<TE>   "That's natural to want to look and see how [the Giants] are
doing, and to think about how good it could turn out, but that's when
you start making mistakes. None of that will help you on the field,
and that's where we need our total focus right now."</TE>
<TE>   Especially in their situation.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers haven't won a playoff game since 1988, and last
qualified for postseason play in 1996. Manager Dusty Baker has guided
the Giants to two West division titles since 1997, and the club
appears to be hitting its stride, completing a stretch of 40 games in
41 days with a record of 25-14 plus the rainout.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have an older car, it probably takes longer to heat up,"
Baker said of his veteran club. "Brand-new cars just start and take
off. They don't need to warm up."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants are coming off a 5-2 trip, splitting four games with
the Dodgers and sweeping the Milwaukee Brewers. They are 45-31 at
Pacific Bell Park, 12-5 against the Padres and 2-1 against the
Astros. "Everyone was pleased with the trip," left-hander Kirk Rueter
said. "We'll take our chances with five home games left."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants are scheduled to face 15-game winner Wade Miller in the
opener against Houston on Friday, and 19-game winner Roy Oswalt on
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to put our best team out there on the field,
especially if it counts," Astro Manager Jimy Williams said. "That's
the only way to play it in this situation."</TE>
<TE>   Said outfielder Lance Berkman: "We want to go out there and sweep
them. We're not buddy-buddy with the Giants."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers took two of three from the Padres after dropping the
opener. Another loss might have ended the race.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to say that it would have been over, but three or
four games with six to play would have ... you're probably starting
to think about vacation," second baseman Mark Grudzielanek said.
"It's hard when you're a couple of games back, but at least we still
have a shot in this scenario.</TE>
<TE>   "We took care of business to stay in this thing, and now every
game is like the playoffs for us. We can't give up anything now at
home. It's really that clear cut."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are 42-33 at Dodger Stadium and 11-6 against the
Rockies, but the Padres have caused them fits. The West's last-place
club is 8-7 against the Dodgers and would revel in ending their
season during a four-game series starting Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, they'll still be right there, and we can stop them
from going to the playoffs," said San Diego right-hander Adam Eaton,
scheduled to start Saturday. "That's what we've got to do."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers would expect nothing less.</TE>
<TE>   "The Padres always play us tough because of the rivalry, and they
have a much better team than their record," right fielder Shawn Green
said. "It's not going to be easy just because the Rockies and Padres
are sub-.500 teams.</TE>
<TE>   "At the same time, if we deserve to be in the playoffs, we should
be able to beat these teams. No matter how many injuries we have or
whatever, if we don't do that with a chance to make the playoffs, the
Giants deserve to go."</TE>
<TE>   That would be fine with the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as we keep winning," Baker said, "everything will be
fine."</TE>

<HD>Rams' Sputtering Start Continues With Loss</HD>
<DH>Pro football: St. Louis falls to 0-3 as offense struggles
in Tampa Bay's 26-14 win. Faulk is injured.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The St. Louis Rams have fallen, and there's no telling when they'll
get up.</LD>
<LD>   They are battered, embarrassed and--after Tampa Bay's 26-14
victory Monday night--0-3 in a non-strike season for the first time
since 1963.</LD>
<LD>   "You just feel sick," tight end Ernie Conwell said. "You sit here
in disbelief. I think that's the feeling of this team."</LD>
<TE>   Trailing by five with two minutes to play, the Rams had a chance
to reverse their fortunes. But, just as they did in "Monday Night
Football" victories over St. Louis the last two seasons, the
Buccaneers came up with a big play at the end.</TE>
<TE>   This time, linebacker Derrick Brooks logged Tampa Bay's fourth
interception of the game, pulling down a Kurt Warner pass at the Ram
39 and dashing down the sideline for the decisive touchdown. It was
Brooks who made a tide-turning play early in the second quarter, when
he upended running back Marshall Faulk.</TE>
<TE>   Faulk, the league's most valuable player in 2000, was escorted to
the locker room, where he was diagnosed with a strained neck and will
have an MRI exam today.</TE>
<TE>   Faulk was a glassy-eyed spectator in the second half, watching his
once-high-octane offense sputter and wheeze.</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers (2-1) gradually built on their 13-7 halftime lead,
increasing the advantage to 19-7 early in the fourth quarter when
Mike Alstott plunged into the end zone from the two. Cornerback Brian
Kelly set up that touchdown with a 31-yard interception return.</TE>
<TE>   "All week we have been telling each other to keep our eyes on Kurt
Warner," said Kelly, in his fifth NFL season out of USC. "We were
getting good reads on the ball. All game we were getting good jumps
on the ball. For some reason, he's been looking real hard at his
receivers. We just sat in our zone and had to read him."</TE>
<TE>   Warner, who insists he isn't bothered by the injured thumb that
hampered him last season, didn't look himself all night. His normally
sharp passes fluttered and wobbled. Afterward, he offered no excuses,
but something is clearly wrong. On consecutive drives in the third
quarter, the Ram offense generated nine, one and eight yards. This
from a team that averaged 32.6 points a game last season--and now is
averaging 17.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll get out of this hole," Warner said. "It's frustrating that
we haven't gotten out of it yet, and we're making so many mistakes
out there it doesn't even resemble the same team I've seen here for
three years, especially from an offensive standpoint.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to suck it up, we've got to dig down deep, and we've
got to get through this thing."</TE>
<TE>   There was no getting through it Monday, even though the Rams had
considerably more yardage (358 to 252) and far more plays (70 to 49).
This game was dictated by Tampa Bay's defense.</TE>
<TE>   "To be able to get a victory on Monday night in front of your home
crowd this early in the season hopefully will give us some momentum,"
Tampa Bay Coach Jon Gruden said. "It's something we can build on."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Rams are reeling, and not only on offense. Coming
into the game, the Rams had seven pass plays of 20 yards or longer
but had surrendered nine such plays. Almost all of those breakdowns
happened on throws over the middle and frequently involved shoddy
tackling.</TE>
<TE>   That's especially surprising because the Rams returned 10
defensive starters, and are that much more familiar with the system
of second-year defensive coordinator Lovie Smith. A former Buccaneer
linebackers coach, Smith took over a wobbly Ram defense in 2001 and
improved its ranking from 23rd to third.</TE>
<TE>   "At this time last year we were doing some of the same things
wrong, but we found a way to make a couple of plays in the end and
win it," Smith said in the week leading up to Monday's game. "That's
what we haven't done this year."</TE>
<TE>   After Faulk went down, Trung Canidate filled in for him and the
Rams mounted a drive deep into Tampa Bay territory. On
second-and-nine from the 16, Warner, trying to find Torry Holt, fired
a point-blank pass directly into the hands of Simeon Rice. The
defensive lineman returned the interception 30 yards, setting up
Tampa Bay's only touchdown of the half--a nine-yard pass to tight end
Rickey Dudley, who was uncovered in the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   Two huge plays kept that drive going. The first was a diving
fingertip catch on third-and-14 by Keyshawn Johnson, who grabbed the
ball inches from the grass for a 21-yard gain. A couple of plays
later, running back Michael Pittman took a handoff, blasted through a
defender at the line of scrimmage, then, with five Rams holding on,
dragged the human pile 14 yards for a first-and-goal at the nine.
Dudley scored on the next play.</TE>
<TE>   "I just had to make the catch," said Dudley, who played for Gruden
in Oakland and was signed last week after Cleveland cut him.
"Everyone else did the hard work."</TE>
<TE>   For the Rams, the hardest work has just begun.</TE>

<HD>Bruins Try Not to Party On</HD>
<DH>College football: UCLA's team leaders speak out against
players' pattern of Thursday nights out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA's greatest test of time management has nothing to do with the
two-minute drill or draining the clock to protect a lead. Classes
begin this week, and players must juggle football with classes and
social engagements.</LD>
<LD>   And to hear the Bruins tell it, social engagements took
precedence, to the detriment of the team, one night a week the last
several years. The itinerary of many players, in fact, included a
glaring blemish.</LD>
<LD>   Monday through Wednesday: Go to class, go to practice.</LD>
<TE>   Thursday: Go to class, go to practice, go, go, go until the wee
hours at house parties, fraternity parties and Westwood watering
holes.</TE>
<TE>   Friday: Take two aspirin, stumble through the short walk-through
practice then repair to the team hotel and get some sleep before
Saturday's game.</TE>
<TE>   "It happens right when school starts, two years [in a row] since
I've been here," junior receiver Tab Perry said. "Thursday nights,
guys would go out and have a little too much fun. Try to unwind a
little too much before the game. That definitely took a toll."</TE>
<TE>   The first test this season is scheduled only days after the Bruins
failed an on-field test for the first time, a 31-17 loss to Colorado
that dropped them to 2-1 and out of the national rankings.</TE>
<TE>   School starts Thursday. The campus community will be buzzing with
celebrations and carousing. Two blocks away, Westwood bars will be
packed.</TE>
<TE>   But UCLA faces San Diego State in an 11 a.m. eye-opener Saturday.
Early to bed and early to rise would seem to be wise.</TE>
<TE>   "When school starts, everything's hectic," Perry said. "You've got
to try to squeeze everything in, get as much in as you can in as
little time as possible. That wears us down, definitely. I don't
think there's really any way you can prepare for that, except to
[eliminate] the going out on Thursday nights."</TE>
<TE>   Perry's viewpoint has support from several key team leaders.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Cory Paus might have been the first one out and last
one in, but his nocturnal habits changed after he'd spent two stints
in jail during the off-season because of driving-under-the-influence
convictions.</TE>
<TE>   The senior quarterback is well into his fourth month without a
drink. He said he would continue to lead by example, not only on
Thursdays but seven nights a week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always a temptation for guys, especially right when school
starts," Paus said. "There's a lot going on and everybody wants to be
part of it.</TE>
<TE>   "But the seniors on this team have made it clear to the younger
players that it's not something we are going to do this year. We've
seen it before and know it doesn't help us prepare for a game."</TE>
<TE>   The player advisory council Coach Bob Toledo assembled this fall
is taking a strong stance against partying. Tackle Mike Saffer and
linebacker Marcus Reese, both seniors, are among the strongest
voices.</TE>
<TE>   Younger council members, such as sophomore running back Manuel
White and junior receiver Ryan Smith, also have made it clear to the
37 freshmen and redshirt freshmen that temperance on Thursday nights
might lead to greater glory on Saturdays.</TE>
<TE>   "We let the young players know the importance of getting rest so
close to the game," White said. "There are only 12 games in a season,
and you are only sacrificing 12 Thursday nights. Everybody should be
OK with that."</TE>
<TE>   Said Toledo: "It helps when so many of the leaders [don't party].
It's easy to give lip service, but if you don't do it yourself, your
voice has more credibility."</TE>
<TE>   Although the coach put much of the responsibility for policing the
team on the council, a string of late-night fights involving players
has prompted him to mete out his own discipline.</TE>
<TE>   At least four players in the last two years have had fights at
bars or frat parties, and three of those incidents resulted in
criminal charges. Toledo has made several local bars off limits
during the season, among them Madison's Neighborhood Grill, the site
of fights last spring that resulted in criminal charges against
cornerback Ricky Manning and guard Shane Lehmann.</TE>
<TE>   "School is starting and [the players] know my stance on it,"
Toledo said. "They'd better not be caught out there."</TE>
<TE>   Any college student, of course, needs a social life. But playing
football requires accountability.</TE>
<TE>   When and how often is it appropriate for players to go out? Should
players of legal drinking age abstain during the season? What is
considered a reasonable hour to call it a night?</TE>
<TE>   Perry wants his teammates on the same page--with their signatures
at the bottom. "I was trying to push for a team pact, something that
we have to sign," he said. "We already signed a drug-abuse form,
saying we're not allowed to do drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "I was saying we should sign something about Thursday nights, that
we don't go out and party, don't drink, don't do anything. Maybe just
chill, a team get-together or something."</TE>
<TE>   Getting a roster of more than 100 to agree on a Thursday night
activity, however, may not be realistic, especially after the team is
together much of the day. Ultimately, each player must be accountable
for his actions.</TE>
<TE>   "Coaches can't go to clubs and bars [to monitor players]," Paus
said. "For the most part, the older players on this team are going to
make the right decisions. If the younger guys follow the lead, there
shouldn't be problems."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Robyn Norwood contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Family Receives Word From Deported Man</HD>
<DH>Pakistan: California resident was being investigated for
possible links to terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three weeks after he was deported to Pakistan, a longtime California
resident questioned for possible links to terrorism has been heard
from by his family, telling them he is being detained in a military
hospital.</LD>
<LD>   The wife and older brother of Nasir Ali Mubarak, 35, said he
telephoned them from the hospital in an undisclosed Pakistan location
late last week for the first time since he was escorted to Pakistan
by two INS agents. They said Mubarak told them he was being held at
the request of the U.S. government--a claim denied by FBI and INS
officials.</LD>
<LD>   "I am relieved to hear from him. I am relieved to hear he is OK,"
Mubarak's American-born wife, Stephanie, said. "But it worries me
that we are in the same boat ... that he is still in custody."</LD>
<TE>   On Aug. 29, Mubarak, who had not lived in Pakistan since he was 3
years old, was voluntarily deported for violating his student visa.</TE>
<TE>   The action followed numerous interviews with FBI and INS agents
since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks investigating Mubarak's time in
the U.S. and particularly his relationship with convicted terrorist
Abdul Hakim Murad. A Pakistani national, Mubarak arrived in the U.S.
with Murad in 1991, and the two attended several flight schools
together. In 1996, Murad was sentenced to life in prison for plotting
to blow up a dozen jetliners over the Pacific Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Before and after Mubarak's deportation, his family and friends
maintained that he had no ties to terrorism and had had no contact
with Murad for years, and didn't even know about Murad's arrest until
1999.</TE>
<TE>   After Mubarak arrived in Pakistan on Aug. 30, his whereabouts
remained a mystery to family and friends until his telephone calls
beginning late last week. They said he told them he had borrowed a
cell phone from someone in the hospital to make the calls.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak told them he had been hospitalized for recurring injuries
resulting from a botched hernia operation years ago, Stephanie
Mubarak said Monday by phone from Corning, Calif., just outside
Chico, where her husband ran an aircraft painting business.</TE>
<TE>   Before being taken to the hospital last week, according to his
wife, Mubarak said he had been detained at a military facility for
questioning that began as soon as he arrived at the airport in
Islamabad.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me he asked them why he was being held," Stephanie
Mubarak said. "And he said he was told the U.S. government wanted to
detain him because he was under suspicion.... Later, he said he was
told it was the FBI" that requested that action.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak's brother, Shafqat, who also lives in California, said he
was told by Mubarak that the detention was requested by the U.S.
officials who handed him over to Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   An INS spokeswoman declined to comment Monday. But in a Sept. 10
letter to Mubarak's attorneys, a lawyer for the INS said no one from
the agency asked for Mubarak to be detained in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   That letter described Mubarak's arrival with the two INS agents,
where they were approached by plainclothes "persons who our officers
believe were officials of the Pakistani government." Mubarak was
eventually taken away in a jeep and not seen again by the INS
officers, the letter said.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Mason, who heads the FBI's Sacramento office, said Monday
that it was "categorically" untrue that his office asked Pakistani
officials to detain Mubarak. "So if he is being held--and I am sure
he is--it must be over something of interest to the Pakistanis,"
Mason said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Pakistani embassy in Washington, D.C., said he
had no details about the nature of Mubarak's detention.</TE>
<TE>   While acknowledging that U.S. authorities never charged Mubarak
with anything other than an immigration violation, Mason said Monday
that that did not mean there are no suspicions that Mubarak knew more
than he told authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not satisfied that he had nothing to do with terrorism,"
Mason said. "Quite the contrary, all the information I have suggests
... there were sufficient connections that necessitated his removal
from this country."</TE>
<TE>   That notion was rejected by Mubarak's supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "He has been cooperative with the FBI since day one," said his
co-counsel Ilyce Shugall.</TE>
<TE>   "He openly talked to them on Sept. 11. He agreed to a polygraph.
He agreed to further interviews later," the San Francisco attorney
said. "And clearly, after all that, there was not sufficient evidence
to charge him with any crime or they would have done so."</TE>

<HD>Fire Prompts Evacuations in La Verne</HD>
<DH>Emergency: Crews battle 5,000-acre blaze in San Gabriel
Mountains. It comes within quarter-mile of homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly 100 homes in the small community of La Verne were evacuated
Monday night as a 5,000-acre wildfire raged out of control in the San
Gabriel Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   The fire was within a quarter-mile to a half-mile of the homes by
11 p.m., said Bruce Quintelier, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest
Service.</LD>
<LD>   About 1,000 firefighters were battling the blaze in the Angeles
National Forest, but it was only 10% contained, said Linda Steinberg,
also a Forest Service spokesperson.</LD>
<TE>   The blaze, in the East Fork of San Gabriel Canyon about 30 miles
northeast of downtown Los Angeles, created a ceiling of brown smoke
that draped Glendora and other suburbs on the foothills of the
mountains.</TE>
<TE>   The homes that were evacuated are between Wheeler Avenue and Live
Oak Canyon Road, and in another location in the Bluebird Estates near
Glendora.</TE>
<TE>   Voluntary evacuations were suggested at another 400 to 500 homes
north of Golden Hills Road. The Red Cross set up a temporary shelter
at Bonita High School.</TE>
<TE>   There was no estimate for when the blaze might be surrounded,
Steinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are experiencing extreme fire conditions: rugged terrain,
heavy brush, and we're looking at 100-plus temperatures."</TE>
<TE>   So far, no injuries were reported and no structures were lost.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters were protecting 77 cabins and Johnstone Peak, home to
ham radio repeaters, cell phone towers and other transmission
devices, Steinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the fire was under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   California 39 into San Gabriel Canyon remained closed, along with
a few mountain roads.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters were being aided by eight helicopters and nine air
tankers.</TE>
<TE>   The wildfire erupted Sunday evening near Camp Williams and Camp
Follows, two privately owned campgrounds. About 2,000 campers
evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   "A bunch of us got in a circle and held hands and prayed," said
Lynn Piazza, who had to leave Camp Williams on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The fire burned three miles southeast of an area scorched earlier
this month by a 16,000-acre fire.</TE>
<TE>   Another fire was burning over 150 acres in a Santa Clara County
park west of Morgan Hill. Hundreds of firefighters attacked the
flames on the ground while 10 planes and helicopters aided from the
air.</TE>
<TE>   That fire burned in Uvas Canyon County Park, a wooded park of more
than 1,200 acres on the eastern side of the Santa Cruz Mountains,
about 55 miles south of San Francisco. Heavy smoke from the fire was
visible in Santa Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   About 200 firefighters were on the scene along with four
helicopters, six air tankers and one air attack, and the blaze was
moving southeast, a California Department of Forestry spokeswoman
said.</TE>

<HD>100 Homes Evacuated as Mountain Fire Rages</HD>
<DH>Safety: About 1,000 firefighters were battling the blaze,
but it was only 10% contained.</DH>

<LD>Nearly 100 homes in the small community of La Verne were evacuated
Monday night as a 5,000-acre wildfire raged out of control in the San
Gabriel Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   The fire was within a quarter-mile to a half-mile of the homes by
11 p.m., said Bruce Quintelier, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest
Service.</LD>
<LD>   About 1,000 firefighters were battling the blaze in the Angeles
National Forest, but it was only 10% contained, said Linda Steinberg,
also a Forest Service spokesperson.</LD>
<TE>   The blaze, in the East Fork of San Gabriel Canyon about 30 miles
northeast of downtown Los Angeles, created a ceiling of brown smoke
that draped Glendora and other suburbs on the foothills of the
mountains.</TE>
<TE>   The homes that were evacuated are between Wheeler Avenue and Live
Oak Canyon Road, and in another location in the Bluebird Estates near
Glendora.</TE>
<TE>   There was no estimate for when the blaze might be surrounded,
Steinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are experiencing extreme fire conditions: rugged terrain,
heavy brush, and we're looking at 100-plus temperatures."</TE>
<TE>   So far, no injuries were reported and no structures were lost.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters were protecting 77 cabins and Johnstone Peak, home to
ham radio repeaters, cell-phone towers and other transmission
devices, Steinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the fire was under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   California 39 into San Gabriel Canyon remained closed, along with
a few mountain roads.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters were being aided by eight helicopters and nine air
tankers.</TE>
<TE>   The wildfire erupted Sunday evening near Camp Williams and Camp
Follows, two privately owned campgrounds. About 2,000 campers
evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   "A bunch of us got in a circle and held hands and prayed," said
Lynn Piazza, who had to leave Camp Williams on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The fire burned three miles southeast of an area scorched earlier
this month by a 16,000-acre fire.</TE>
<TE>   Another fire was burning over 150 acres in a Santa Clara County
park west of Morgan Hill. Hundreds of firefighters attacked the
flames on the ground while 10 planes and helicopters aided from the
air.</TE>
<TE>   That fire burned in Uvas Canyon County Park, a wooded park of more
than 1,200 acres on the eastern side of the Santa Cruz Mountains,
about 55 miles south of San Francisco. Heavy smoke from the fire was
visible in Santa Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   About 200 firefighters were on the scene along with four
helicopters, six air tankers and one air attack, and the blaze was
moving southeast, a California Department of Forestry spokeswoman
said.</TE>

Mountains northeast of Glendora. Nearly 100 homes in the small
community of La Verne were evacuated Monday night as the fire raged
out of control. Gusting winds, rugged terrain and high temperatures
made the job harder for the more than 1,000 federal and state
personnel deployed. Flames first broke out Sunday evening near Camp
Williams on the east fork of the San Gabriel River. Officials said
the blaze was only 10% contained.</CP>

<DH>Assaults: A suspected anti-gay incident in West Hollywood
in which a man was beaten leads to increased patrols.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sheriff's patrols were more than doubled and rewards increased Monday
after an assault on a man brought to four the number of suspected
hate crimes in West Hollywood since Sept. 2.</LD>
<LD>   The latest victim, a 55-year-old gay man, was in stable condition
at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Sheriff's Capt. Linda Castro said.</LD>
<LD>   The attack Sunday, in the 900 block of Palm Avenue, was near the
site of two attacks early on Sept. 2: against actor Treve Broudy, who
was critically injured, and against two other men. Castro said the
use of similar weapons and similar descriptions of two suspects have
led investigators to think the crimes may be related.</LD>
<TE>   The suspects were described as black and 18 to 25 years old. One
is 5 feet, 5 inches tall, the other 6 feet, 2 inches tall. In the
Sept. 2 attacks, witnesses said, the assailants drove a 1987 or 1988
light brown or faded red, four-door Nissan.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 15, a short distance away, two people were beaten by a
group of more than 15 people to chants of "kill the Jews." Two men
were arrested, and others are being sought; that attack is not
believed related to the anti-gay crimes, Castro said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Sunday morning attack, the victim was described by
authorities as a visitor to West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "The two assailants began yelling anti-gay epithets at the victim
as they hit him numerous times in the head, face and body. The victim
attempted to cover his head to protect himself," according to the
deputies' account.</TE>
<TE>   A passing cab driver intervened, chasing the assailants until they
ran out of sight, Castro said. The taxi driver then took the victim
home. The victim, whom deputies declined to identify at his request,
sought medical treatment 14 hours later, and hospital workers called
police.</TE>
<TE>   Castro said the Sheriff's Department is asking the taxi driver to
come forward and assist in the investigation. She expressed
appreciation for his intervention.</TE>
<TE>   Late-night patrols have been increased from 12 to 30 deputies
around the Sunset Strip, Castro told the West Hollywood City Council
on Monday night. The area of heavily reinforced patrols is bounded by
Doheny Road and La Cienega, Sunset and Santa Monica boulevards. She
said in some cases, empty patrol cars have been parked in strategic
spots.</TE>
<TE>   In an impassioned address to the City Council, a sergeant in the
West Hollywood sheriff's station, Don Mueller, said the station is
devoted to the capture of the attackers.</TE>
<TE>   "The ferocious relationship that used to exist between the
sheriff's station and the gay community is a thing of the past,"
Mueller said. "There are now many gay officers in the station,
including myself, and we are determined to bring these attacks to an
end."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Paul Koretz (D-West Hollywood), who is also a former
mayor of West Hollywood, announced at a news conference Monday that
rewards in the anti-gay attacks are being raised to $85,000. Koretz
said he hopes Gov. Gray Davis will agree to add $50,000 in state
money.</TE>
<TE>   Koretz said he is hopeful that "the suspects bragged about these
atrocities to their friends," and that the reward money will lead
someone to come forward.</TE>
<TE>   The West Hollywood community is "shocked, upset, fearful and
angry," Koretz said. "We need to send a message by catching the
people responsible."</TE>
<TE>   West Hollywood Mayor Sal Guarriello said in a telephone interview,
"This is not the first time we've had hate crimes in West Hollywood."
Guarriello said he is confident the Sheriff's Department will solve
the crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Guarriello said West Hollywood has about 36,000 residents, of whom
he estimated 25% to 28% are gay.</TE>
<TE>   There also was discussion Monday about holding public meetings at
which representatives of the Sheriff's Department, the district
attorney's office and anti-hate organizations might advise residents
how to prevent attacks, or what to do if they happen.</TE>
<TE>   Castro said it is vital to immediately report attacks.
Confidentiality, if requested, will be respected, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The latest victim may have hesitated to come forward because he
was afraid of being identified," Castro said.</TE>
<TE>   Also at the Koretz news conference was Roger Coggan, director of
legal services and public policy for the L.A. Gay &amp; Lesbian Center,
who said crimes can be reported anonymously to a hate crime hotline
the center has established. The toll free number is (800) 373-2227,
Coggan said. The center immediately notifies law enforcement
officials when it is appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information about the incidents can call Mueller or
Det. John Kniest of the West Hollywood Sheriff's Station at (310)
855-8850.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day, state Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica),
reiterated, "I think it's critical for victims and witnesses to
report these incidents as quickly as possible."</TE>
<TE>   "These predatory hatemongers count on silence to protect them,
just as rapists used to, and we must respond as a community," she
said.</TE>

<HD>City's Compassion Faces Challenge</HD>
<DH>Homeless: In Santa Monica, long generous to the needy, a
proposal would restrict charity meal distributions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Has Santa Monica, which has long embraced liberal policies to help
the homeless, come down with a case of compassion fatigue?</LD>
<LD>   Complaints from residents, merchants and tourists have mounted in
recent months about homeless people sleeping in the doorways of
downtown businesses, panhandling aggressively and setting up camp in
prime parkland near the Santa Monica Pier.</LD>
<LD>   Getting much of the blame for what is widely perceived to be an
increase in the homeless population is a plethora of free meals
offered in three parks near the downtown area: Palisades, Memorial
and Reed.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the meals, a city report says, are provided by a patchwork
of as many as 30 groups, many of them faith-based and almost all from
outside the city.</TE>
<TE>   The groups travel from such communities as Manhattan Beach,
South-Central Los Angeles, Calabasas and Oxnard, attracting as many
as 300 people at a meal with fruit, bagels and brown-bag sandwiches.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure from the city's business community to do something,
the Santa Monica City Council plans to vote tonight on two
ordinances.</TE>
<TE>   One would seek to limit free outdoor meals by requiring groups
serving 150 or more meals to adhere to community event laws and
county health standards. Some activists say such a rule would
effectively ban the food giveaways.</TE>
<TE>   The other proposal would make it illegal to sit or lie down in
downtown doorways.</TE>
<TE>   A small army of speakers has signed up to voice opinions on the
subject, and the seven-member council is expected to engage in a long
and lively debate. Activists also plan to hand out free meals at City
Hall at 5:30 p.m., before the council meeting begins, as part of a
"Brown Bag Justice" protest.</TE>
<TE>   Moira LaMountain, a volunteer with several of the food providers,
said she organized the protest because she considers the proposed
laws outrageous.</TE>
<TE>   She said that many low-wage workers also take advantage of the
food programs because they must spend as much as three-quarters of
their income on housing.</TE>
<TE>   "At a time when government resources are stretched to the max, the
Santa Monica City Council is contemplating an action that will
criminalize private charity and compassion," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Council members are sharply divided in their views, and it is
unclear how the vote might go.</TE>
<TE>   "Santa Monica is a compassionate community and has provided a wide
variety of services because of that," said Councilman Richard H.
Bloom, who favors the new ordinances. "When we have [these] feeding
programs, it's counterproductive to our continuum of care."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, he and his supporters reason, homeless people with
full stomachs will be less motivated to seek out programs that could
help them make the transition from the streets to a productive life,
and to get treatment for mental disorders or alcohol or substance
abuse.</TE>
<TE>   For 2002, Santa Monica budgeted about $1.8 million from its
general fund to support 22 social service programs that aid the
homeless.</TE>
<TE>   The city, with a population of about 88,000, estimates its
homeless population on any given day at 1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Opposing the ordinances is Mayor Pro Tem Kevin McKeown.</TE>
<TE>   "In the heat of election year posturing, we mustn't forget our
decisions affect people," McKeown said. "If we ban sleeping in
business doorways, will we move the homeless into residential
neighborhood carports and laundry rooms?"</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas Vrataric, executive director of the CLARE Foundation,
which provides substance abuse treatment in Santa Monica, said
residents and business owners have become frustrated as the homeless
population has grown, even as tax dollars have supported an array of
social services.</TE>
<TE>   Vrataric is also chairman of the Westside Shelter and Hunger
Coalition. "There's an increased sense that the problem is not
getting any better," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many involved in the debate said the increasing homeless problem
in Santa Monica reflects the failures of neighboring communities.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of what we're up against," said Julie Rusk, the city's human
services manager, "is that other communities aren't doing their part
to address homelessness and to provide affordable housing and social
services. A community like ours suffers an impact.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting feedback," she added, "that the impact is too great
right now."</TE>

<HD>Resignation, Suspension in Inglewood</HD>
<DH>Discipline: City attorney quits after state bar court finds
he mishandled a client's funds in a real estate deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN L. MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inglewood's city attorney has resigned after a state bar court found
him guilty of misappropriating a client's funds and suspended him
from practicing law for 18 months.</LD>
<LD>   Charles E. Dickerson III handed in his resignation last week after
the State Bar Court in Los Angeles found he put his client's funds in
his personal account, an "act involving moral turpitude, dishonesty
or corruption."</LD>
<LD>   Dickerson had been hired in October 1990 by relatives of the late
Reese Jordan to sell two houses in Los Angeles. In 1995, the sale of
the house on 66th Street netted approximately $4,000. Another house
on Bonsallo Street netted $54,652, according to the court.</LD>
<TE>   Dickerson told his clients about the $4,000 and said he "would be
holding the money until the estate was closed," the court said. But
he failed to maintain a record of what he did with that check, a
violation of rules of conduct, the court said.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the second house, however, Dickerson put the check
in his personal account without telling the clients, the court said.
During October of that year, he wrote checks totaling more than
$50,000 from that account, the court found. In December, he finally
told the clients that escrow on the house had closed. He eventually
turned over the money, but was accused of failing to keep proper
records and of commingling his money and theirs.</TE>
<TE>   He could not be reached for comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The court granted Dickerson a 30-month stay from the start of his
18-month suspension, noting that he had practiced for 15 years with
an unblemished record. Stronger punishment would have been likely,
the court said, but for mitigating factors such as Dickerson's years
of public service.</TE>
<TE>   Dickerson, who will be 50 next Monday, served as president of the
Los Angeles Board of Public Works in the early '90s and then worked
as a deputy city attorney in Los Angeles under Mayor James K. Hahn,
then city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Known as a gifted singer, he also directed the choir of Holman
United Methodist Church at the services on Sept. 11 at the Cathedral
of Our Lady of Angels.</TE>
<TE>   In Inglewood, Dickerson's suspension came as a shock. Mayor
Roosevelt Dorn said the attorney's resignation was immediately
accepted.</TE>
<TE>   "It means we have an acting city attorney until the council does a
search for a new one," Dorn said. "I'm disappointed because I think
Mr. Dickerson had been here long enough where he learned what
municipal government was all about. He became a more effective lawyer
as time passed. Now we will have to hire another attorney, and
certainly I hope it will be a fine attorney with a vast municipal law
background."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Jerome Horton, a former member of the City Council who
participated in Dickerson's selection, said he was surprised that the
attorney never mentioned the pending court case when he was selected
in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he had personal reasons for not telling us," he said "No
one knew about it."</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Judy Dunlap said she didn't vote for Dickerson for
city attorney because he was not the choice of the city's executive
search team. "He wasn't even one of the finalists," said Dunlap, a
nine-year council veteran. "I wasn't presented with a resume, and I
was concerned about that."</TE>
<TE>   Marilyn Douroux, a longtime resident and critic of the city
administration, said it should have taken more time to investigate
his background. "His appointment was political," she said. "There
were better candidates that they passed over."</TE>
<TE>   In his two years on the job, Dickerson had weathered several
storms in a city that is no stranger to controversy.</TE>
<TE>   He was among the city officials accused by a group of residents of
violating the Ralph M. Brown Act by holding meetings without proper
public notice and at times inconvenient to residents.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, he was involved in the city's response to the
police beating of teenager Donovan Jackson at an Inglewood gas
station. Dickerson provided courts with a list of 170 cases since
1990 in which lawsuits were filed against police officers for civil
rights violations, shootings and alleged use of excessive force. The
city has paid $1.8 million in claims for those cases.</TE>
<TE>   After his 18-month suspension from practice, he will remain on
probation for five years.</TE>

<HD>Davis OKs Paid Family Leave Bill</HD>
<DH>Benefits: Governor wins praise from advocates and strong
criticism from business groups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION and MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marisol Quintero, a bill collector, said paid family leave would have
made life much easier when her baby son was born with a rare disease
and needed her at home.</LD>
<LD>   But Bill Nelson, who employs 65 people at four Northern California
lube shops, said he worries that such a benefit will cost him
business when, for example, an experienced store manager takes six
weeks off to care for a newborn or a sick relative.</LD>
<LD>   As Gov. Gray Davis signed a bill Monday creating the nation's
first comprehensive paid family leave, business leaders counted
flaws. The new law will give up to six weeks of partially paid leave
to an estimated 13 million California workers. Payments will come
from employee contributions and take effect in 2004.</LD>
<TE>   Where employees and labor leaders see a morale-boosting benefit,
small- and medium-size business owners fear losses from unplanned
absenteeism and the skyrocketing cost of temporary replacements.</TE>
<TE>   And many in California's small-business community say some
employees already abuse the federal law granting unpaid leave for
births and family sick care. They argue that even more employees will
be tempted to lie or skirt the rules under California's paid leave
initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have problem with employees having time off for
legitimate illnesses or family reasons, but there are abusers of this
family leave program," said Paul Calvert, western regional vice
president for Inland Paperboard and Packaging, a division of a
Texas-based company that employs 2,000 people in California.</TE>
<TE>   Calvert said employees in one plant already had a name for the
unpaid family leave act adopted under President Clinton. "They call
it the 'Gold Card,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   The 150 employees had taken 311 family leave absences in the last
14 months, Calvert said. About 90% of those absences were without
notice and lasted one day, he said. About 25 of the plant's 150
employees accounted for the most of the absences, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The California Manufacturers and Technology Assn., which opposed
the bill, had argued that without a length of service requirement,
"even a temporary worker would be able to take six weeks off." Small
businesses, those with five to 10 employees, will have the most
trouble covering for missing workers, association officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so easy for someone to say, 'Aunt Mary needs me to go take
care of her,' and the decision whether that person is eligible for
paid leave or not is going to be made" by the Employment Development
Department, said Nelson, owner of the Pennzoil 10-Minute Oil Change
shops.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just going to encourage abuse. Most people won't abuse
it," he said. "But it doesn't take a large population to abuse
something to really run up the cost and cause havoc for employers."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Lucas, who employs 70 people at four outlets of his Southern
California Performance Nursery, aimed his frustration at Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "Small businesses can't take another hit like this," said Lucas.
"We can't afford to have Gray for another four years. The unions are
pushing this down his throat. I wish he'd wake up."</TE>
<TE>   Davis and advocates of the bill said Monday that the new law will
fairly balance the needs of workers and employers.</TE>
<TE>   The policy will pay workers 55% of weekly salaries for time off to
care for sick children, spouses, parents or domestic partners, as
well as for parents of newborn or newly adopted children. The amount
will be capped at $728 a week and is tax-free. Workers will pay up to
$70 a year into the benefit fund.</TE>
<TE>   Davis agreed to the bill after the program was scaled back from
earlier proposals allowing 12 weeks of paid leave and requiring
employer contributions.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want parents in California to have to choose between
being a good parent and a good employee," said Davis during the
bill-signing on the lawn outside UCLA's Children's Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics showing that three of four Californians cannot afford
to lose a paycheck to care for sick family members help persuade
Davis to sign the bill, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Labor leaders and women's advocates, who called the program long
overdue, waited in blistering heat for Davis to appear. It's hot,
someone said, prompting the bill's sponsor, state Sen. Sheila Kuehl
(D-Santa Monica), to jump to the microphone.</TE>
<TE>   "But not as much heat as we took getting this bill through," she
said to applause.</TE>
<TE>   Kuehl and other boosters of the legislation ticked off a long list
of worker benefits that business predicted would ruin the American
economy, including minimum wage laws, workers' compensation and
unions.</TE>
<TE>   Workers rights advocates argue that the new law will make
California more attractive to skilled workers.</TE>
<TE>   They say productivity will go up if workers have a safety net for
family emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP gubernatorial candidate, Bill Simon Jr., agreed with
business leaders in opposing the leave bill signed by Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "I support the concept of paid leave for people, particularly
workers who can't afford to take unpaid leave," the candidate said
during a campaign stop in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   But he added: "I don't think this is the best way to accomplish
some type of paid leave, because, in effect, what this really is, is
a kind of tax on 14 million Californians in the workforce."</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he would support an optional program, allowing workers
who wanted the benefit to pay into the system.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he signed the bill for such workers as Quintero, who
introduced Davis to the crowd. When her son was 2 months old and her
maternity leave was nearly used up, she said she got terrible news.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder that would
require many blood transfusions and constant care.</TE>
<TE>   Going back to work was out of the question, even though she and
her husband needed the income.</TE>
<TE>   In the ensuing weeks, as bills mounted, the Quinteros barely made
ends meet.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried financial aid, but there was really no hope," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Quintero, who sat on a makeshift stage, her daughter in her lap
and son nearby in his father's arms, broke into a smile as the
governor signed the bill.</TE>
<TE>   "Something like this," she said later," would have really made a
difference for us."</TE>

<HD>Simon Calls Davis Labor Policies Bad for Business</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr. accused Gov. Gray
Davis on Monday of creating an anti-business climate in California
that is pushing companies to insolvency and contributing to the
state's unemployment.</LD>
<LD>   On the same day that Davis signed a landmark paid family leave
bill, Simon said he would work to reverse workers' compensation
increases, the eight-hour workday and other labor regulations that he
said are "strangling" businesses and slowing economic growth.</LD>
<LD>   "We know our state is not friendly to job growth," the GOP
candidate told several hundred members of a women's business forum
during a morning address at a Long Beach airport hotel.</LD>
<TE>   Though Simon expressed mixed feelings about the paid family leave
measure--saying that he supports the concept but not the bill--he
fiercely criticized other labor laws signed by the governor.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said Davis' approval in February of legislation that almost
doubled injury and death benefits for workers has burdened businesses
and failed to help employees.</TE>
<TE>   "California's workers' compensation system is broken," he said.
"How else could you describe a system in which employers pay the
highest premiums in the nation, and injured workers get among the
worst benefits?"</TE>
<TE>   Davis' aides disputed Simon's contention.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor has created a positive business environment, meeting
the needs of both business and labor," said a Davis spokesman,
Gabriel Sanchez, adding that California had gained 900,000 jobs in
the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   "We're facing a national recession and, despite all that,
California is still doing better than the national economy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez said the labor laws that Simon wants to roll back "have
benefited millions of Californians."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's address kicked off a week in which he plans to pitch his
message about curtailing business regulations at campaign stops in
the Silicon Valley, Ontario and Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Opportunity, a level playing field, a chance to succeed--that's
what you all want," he said Monday to enthusiastic applause.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want the government giving you a handout, do you? You
just want the government getting out of the way, right?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some political experts warned that although Simon's message about
limiting government rules may resonate with the Republican Party
faithful and business leaders, it may not connect with the broad
swath of voters who have different financial concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "Workers' comp and things of this sort are not at the top of
people's agenda," said Lawrence Giventer, a professor of political
science at Cal State Stanislaus.</TE>
<TE>   "Financially, what people are worried about is maintaining
employment, if they have it, and getting jobs if they don't," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "And those in the middle class are still stewing about their
401(k)s," he added.</TE>
<TE>   After his speech, Simon joined several business owners in a
round-table discussion about state-mandated expenses that they say
are harming their companies.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Anderson, president of a company that makes paper bags for
fast-food restaurants, said a 120% increase in his workers'
compensation premiums this year will force him to lay off 40
employees.</TE>
<TE>   "It breaks my heart. It really does," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they're going to be on the street because of a party that
claims to be for the people," Anderson added.</TE>
<TE>   Maria de Lourdes Sobrino, founder of a dessert company based in
Vernon, said workers' compensation and overtime costs threaten her
ability to make a profit.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to give more benefits to my employees, but I can't,"
Sobrino said.</TE>
<TE>   Cristi Cristich, founder of an electronic component company, said
the overhead in California is so high that when she recently decided
to expand her Anaheim business, she concluded that it would be
cheaper to add a second plant in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   The neighboring state offered her free land, state-reimbursed
training and other perks, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an example of the state and business community working to
create a better environment, and that's what we need back in
California," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said one of his first priorities as governor would be to
balance the budget by scaling back government operations.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to cut government, bottom line," he said.</TE>

<HD>Plea Deal Upsets Scorned Lawyers</HD>
<DH>Justice: They want a tougher sentence for an attorney who
allegedly used a stolen identity to chastise them online.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Criminal defense lawyers make their living in part by pleading for
forgiveness on behalf of their clients. But in the case of Ana Maria
Patino, members of the California Public Defender Assn. are crying
out for blood.</LD>
<LD>   Patino is a Santa Ana attorney who used the organization's closed
Internet chat room to attack other members with a stream of angry
missives, association officials say.</LD>
<LD>   After being booted out of the group last year, Patino reemerged
surreptitiously, using the online identity of a young law school
graduate, prosecutors said.</LD>
<TE>   This prompted an investigation by the FBI and local police that
resulted in charges of identity theft and forgery.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors, however, have agreed to dismiss the charges if Patino
apologizes, performs community service and pays $1,500 in fines.</TE>
<TE>   The deal has members of the association crying foul, saying that
Patino victimized them and avoided jail time by hiring a
well-connected defense lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   They say prosecutors are letting her off too easily.</TE>
<TE>   They also complain that as the "victims" of the crime, they were
never consulted about the plea deal.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm astounded. Clearly the D.A. doesn't care about identity
theft," said association board member Don Landis, who is an Orange
County deputy public defender.</TE>
<TE>   "They're really interested in victims' issues when they want to be
tough on some indigent client who pocketed something at Mervyn's, but
when it comes to dealing with an Orange County lawyer, it's a
different matter. It's hypocritical."</TE>
<TE>   Members of the group--which is open to all defense attorneys--plan
to take the unusual step of asking a judge next month to scuttle the
plea bargain and demand stiffer punishment for Patino.</TE>
<TE>   Patino, a defense lawyer who specializes in appeals cases
involving immigration law, was the chat room's most active
participant.</TE>
<TE>   Firing off 10 to 15 critical messages a day on a variety of
criminal-defense topics, Patino would sometimes sign her electronic
missives as "Xena" or "Lady Anne."</TE>
<TE>   Chat-room users say many lawyers felt the heat of Patino's flames,
but the 54-year-old attorney allegedly crossed the line when she
picked fights with the leader of the Orange County Bar Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't know why you would think anyone would care what
you think," Patino wrote to then-Orange County Bar President Jennifer
Keller.</TE>
<TE>   "You never have ceased to amaze me in your pretentious sense of
power which you choose to gloat over people."</TE>
<TE>   Patino also took aim at association director Michael Cantrall,
cursing him and vowing to "bring you down and everyone else
associated with you."</TE>
<TE>   The defenders group responded by stripping Patino of her chat-room
privileges and terminating her membership in the association.</TE>
<TE>   But in June of last year, just weeks after she was bounced from
the chat room, Patino reemerged under a false identity, the
association said.</TE>
<TE>   Using the name and a bar license number of a 28-year-old law
school graduate, Patino reportedly resumed her electronic chats as
Lianna Figueroa.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged ruse worked for several months, association officials
said, until Patino began to complain to the site's Webmaster about
service.</TE>
<TE>   The Webmaster reportedly recognized Patino's confrontational style
and telephoned the real Lianna Figueroa to ask whether she was
dissatisfied with the Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no clue what they were talking about," Figueroa said.</TE>
<TE>   "I just finished law school. I never applied to them for an
account."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities eventually charged Patino with identity theft, forgery
and fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Patino hired powerhouse Orange County defense lawyer Alan Stokke,
who discussed a plea deal with prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan Riezman said Stokke's political
connections played no role in the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an appropriate agreement based on the totality of the
circumstances, and the non-seriousness of the crime," Riezman said.</TE>
<TE>   "The victim suffered no financial loss nor any loss of
reputation."</TE>
<TE>   Riezman noted the matter would also be investigated by the State
Bar of California.</TE>
<TE>   Patino insists that she has done nothing wrong and is being
persecuted by the association. "I am innocent," Patino said. "I do
not know anything about Lianna Figueroa. I don't know her and I don't
know anything about an apology."</TE>
<TE>   She insists that the public defenders are out to get her. As an
appeals lawyer, she said, she regularly exposes the sloppy work of
public defenders.</TE>
<TE>   "Their motivation is to get back at me," Patino said. "I make them
look bad. They're motivated by envy."</TE>
<TE>   Figueroa, the lawyer whose identity Patino allegedly used, said
she has been troubled by the experience.</TE>
<TE>   She said prosecutors should hold Patino to a higher standard
because she is a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea what this person was telling people under my name,
and I'm worried people will think it's me who said it," Figueroa
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody seems to care. I went to the police and they said, 'Big
whoop, nobody lost any money.' I want somebody to take this
seriously."</TE>
