<LD>As the curtain fell on 2001, celebrity news was churning with a
pre-Sept. 11 ferocity. Winona Ryder was arrested on suspicion of
shoplifting from Saks Fifth Avenue. Mystery shrouded the location of
George Harrison's death. A few months ago, these reports might have
seemed in poor taste. After all, even Liz Smith declared gossip dead.
But human nature abhors a vacuum ... of celebrity news.</LD>
<LD>   And so, as the lights come up on 2002, we review some of the more
talked-about stories of last year:</LD>
<LD>   Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman divorced after 10 years of marriage.
But that was just one of many court cases in which the power couple
starred.</LD>
<TE>   Kidman received some unwelcome attention from aspiring actor
Matthew E. Hooker. In May, she got a three-year restraining order
against Hooker when a Santa Monica judge found "clear and convincing
evidence" that Hooker harassed and "seriously annoyed" the actress.
Hooker claimed he was only trying to woo the actress, offering to
take her out for ice cream and inviting her to the ballet.</TE>
<TE>   Cruise filed a couple of defamation lawsuits--including one
against a magazine publisher who claimed to have a compromising
videotape of the actor. (That suit was dropped after the publisher
backpedaled.)</TE>
<TE>   But the year also featured some bright moments for the two stars.
Cruise took up with Penelope Cruz (Us Weekly reported this week that
wedding bells are nigh), and Kidman told David Letterman after the
break: "Well, I can wear heels now."</TE>
<TE>   Other high-profile splits included Julia Roberts and Benjamin
Bratt, Jennifer Lopez and Sean "P. Diddy" "Puff Daddy" Combs.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Lynn Redgrave battled ex-husband John Clark in Los
Angeles Superior Court over the couple's property. The couple's
32-year marriage collapsed over Thanksgiving dinner in 1998 when
Clark revealed to Redgrave that he was the biological father of a
family friend's child.</TE>
<TE>   But divorce was not the only item on the court calendar.</TE>
<TE>   In January, David Warren "Skippy" Malloy was ordered to stay at
least 100 yards away from David Spade by a Superior Court judge in
Beverly Hills after he attacked the petite actor with a stun gun.</TE>
<TE>   After legal woes involving her children, Paula Poundstone
completed court-ordered alcohol rehab and began her comeback.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood trades had their share of problems, too. Variety
Editor in Chief Peter Bart was briefly suspended from his job after
an unflattering Los Angeles magazine profile.</TE>
<TE>   At the Hollywood Reporter, editor Anita Busch, deputy Beth Laski
and reporter Dave Robb all resigned, they said, to protest the
paper's handling of ethics allegations against its longtime columnist
George Christy. (Christy eventually left the paper.)</TE>
<TE>   During the summer, President Bush's daughters discovered
Hollywood. The 19-year-old Jenna Bush, who was in town for an
internship at Brillstein-Grey, and her twin sister, Barbara, made
their mark on the local celebrity scene with appearances at the sexy
club Deep in Hollywood-- Secret Service agents in tow.</TE>
<TE>   At the intersection of Hollywood and politics: Arnold
Schwarzenegger reportedly courted the Republican candidacy for
governor, but dropped out some time after Premiere magazine published
an unflattering profile. (Oh, those unflattering profiles!)</TE>
<TE>   In November, as Richard Riordan announced his candidacy for the
office, Schwarzenegger offered his support.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone was breaking up or getting sued. Some folks got
married:</TE>
<TE>   Sonny Bono's widow Rep. Mary Bono (R-Palm Springs) married Wyoming
businessman Glenn Baxley in Palm Springs.... Pierce Brosnan and Keely
Shaye Smith wed.... Jennifer Lopez and Cris Judd tied the knot in
September.... Edward Burns and Christy Turlington set a November
wedding date, then postponed it.... TLC's Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes and
former Atlanta Falcon wide receiver Andre Rison reignited their flame
and got engaged this year.</TE>
<TE>   And the best quote of the year? It comes from the guest of honor
at a private gathering last summer in Hancock Park:</TE>
<TE>   "Hi, my name is Al Gore, and I used to be the next president of
the United States."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By Chaim Potok</LD>
<LD>   Alfred A. Knopf</LD>
<LD>   274 pages, $23</LD>
<TE>   Chaim Potok captured international acclaim more than 30 years ago
when his stunning first novel, "The Chosen," made its debut. In the
intervening decades, he's continued to publish stories delving into
the lives of Jews, religious and secular alike, as they make sense of
their existence in this post-Holocaust age. "Old Men at Midnight,"
Potok's most recent work, is comprised of three loosely connected
novellas, all of which share Ilana Davita Chandal (a character from
his 1985 novel "Davita's Harp") as the passive recipient of tales
told by men facing their pasts.</TE>
<TE>   "The Ark Builder" focuses on 16-year-old Noah, a European refugee
in New York during the summer of 1947. Davita, herself only 17, is
hired as the English tutor for the young man. She encourages both
Noah's English and his drawing skills, slowly pulling out stories of
the German army's invasion of Noah's Polish hometown and the
attendant memories that refuse to abate. "Four thousand Jews, and he
is the only survivor," the boy's aunt explains. "My husband and I, we
say to ourselves God saved him for a reason."</TE>
<TE>   Just as Davita is the book's structural nexus, the idea of having
been saved for some unknowable purpose is the leitmotif that plays
throughout the narratives. Leon Shertov in "The War Doctor," for
example, recalls his early years as a religious Jew during the
Russian Civil War and the compassionate doctor who saved his wounded
arm. In exchange for teaching the doctor "to read and speak our
sacred language," Leon is granted travel documents that rescue him
from near-certain death. Leon's having been saved, though, seems more
curse than blessing when he uses his liberation to become a colonel
with the KGB, specializing in interrogation and torture, and later
re-encounters the doctor who'd been so instrumental in his early
life.</TE>
<TE>   Davita, who has meanwhile become a teaching assistant at Columbia
University, asks the now-aged Leon to record his memories because
"the past is erased without stories." With a degree of compliance
that borders on implausible--men seem to spill their otherwise
guarded stories when she asks, an ease that weakens the book's
impact--Leon writes a response to Davita's request, the text of which
makes up the lion's share of that tale.</TE>
<TE>   The final novella, "The Trope Teacher," is narrated by Benjamin
Walter, a 68-year-old celebrated professor of military history who's
attempting to write his memoirs but can't recall the early years.
Benjamin's new neighbor, the same Davita who's now a successful
novelist in her 50s, helps him remember the story of Mr. Zapiski, the
trope teacher of Benjamin's youth, around whom the story coalesces.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Zapiski is the European immigrant who taught Benjamin to chant
scripture in preparation for his bar mitzvah and is the one character
who rejects salvation. As the terror of World War II gains intensity,
he forgoes his safety in the U.S. and voluntarily returns to Europe,
ready to face inevitable death.</TE>
<TE>   Countless years later, as Benjamin reflects with Davita on the
early words of the trope teacher, they shimmer with meaning. "First,
I will teach you the notes and grammar of the notes," Zapiski had
told him. "Then I will teach you the meaning behind the grammar. And
if I see that you have truly mastered that, I will teach you the
magic of this music, things few people know." Finding meaning behind
grammar, truth beneath history, solace amid the pain of remembering
is Potok's aim. But doing so, his stories make clear, is seldom easy.
There is a specific burden carried by those who have been saved, a
responsibility that is neither clear-cut nor easy to administer.
Here, Potok expertly examines the weight of remembrance as a
disquieting inheritance. When Davita helps Benjamin conjure buried
memories, for example, she loses her temper with his desire for
safety in the process. "You want to be sure?" she demands of him. "Go
to your tax collector, get hit by lightning, that's sure.... You want
memory and comfort?"</TE>
<TE>   It is unfortunate that this scene is one of the very few in which
Davita, the listener, is given any life or substance. The rest of the
time, her story is overshadowed by that of the men telling theirs.
The result is to whet without satisfying the reader's interest in
her, a regrettable aspect, since the novellas hold together on their
content alone. The book, though flawed by this structural issue,
continues to build Potok's oeuvre of heartfelt literature of Jewish
assimilation in the aftermath of unfathomable violence. The stories
he tells, like those of his characters, claim our attention.</TE>
<TE>   Memory and comfort, though not necessarily incompatible, Potok
tells us, are often at odds. In piecing together our difficult tales,
memory must come first, like the trope teacher's grammar lesson.
Then, if we're lucky, we'll hear the transcendental music that makes
the memories, like Potok's stories, if not exactly consoling,
life-affirming and essential.</TE>

<HD>Guests Who Wear Out Their Welcome</HD>
<DH>It doesn't take long for visitors to take the 'happy' out
of holidays.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNE MARIE LASKAS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Right about now the temptation is to make the most unimaginative of
New Year's resolutions: no more holiday house guests. Because the
holidays are stressful enough without having people in your house
undergoing apparent orange juice withdrawal.</LD>
<LD>   No problem, you say to your holiday house guest, you have cans of
Minute Maid in the basement freezer. Huh? Your holiday house guest
does not drink orange juice with frozen-can lineage? He offers to go
to the store and get some fresh-squeezed. You give him directions to
the store. Why no, you tell your holiday house guest, you are not
100% certain they carry organic orange juice at that store. But come
to think of it there is a GNC two towns over that may have it, and so
you begin writing those directions, which are complicated, and you
can't remember some of the street names and so you say, "I'll go."</LD>
<LD>   Holiday house guests. For the year 2002 you could issue a ban. You
could say, "No more!" Does it matter that it's family? Does it matter
that most of the people who have come into your home and stayed
overnight are in some way related to you? No, it does not. Because
you can love your brother more than life itself, but that does not
mean you want his hair clogging your drain.</LD>
<TE>   It always starts out well. When holiday house guests arrive, you
almost always get one entirely happy first day. You are so glad to
see these people you rarely get to see. They are so happy to be here,
not to mention to be off the airplane or train or freeway that
brought them to you. You have a nice dinner. You tell stories. You
may even sit around the fireplace and sing holiday songs. You go to
bed thinking this is all such fun.</TE>
<TE>   And then something happens. No known person in the history of
holiday house guests has ever figured out exactly what happens. There
is research to suggest that time itself stops. That a kind of vacuum
takes over, sucking you into a whirlpool of tension and anxiety.
There's a lot that goes into it. There are toothbrushes everywhere,
and odd teeth-cleaning devices. There is more than you want to know
about the bathing habits of your loved ones. There's everyone needing
to check e-mail on your poor computer, which hasn't been acting right
lately, anyway. There are the cans of abandoned Coke everywhere, all
of them three-quarters full of warm, flat Coke.</TE>
<TE>   There's your sister's boyfriend, who has not said a word to
anyone, a grown man sitting for days in the corner playing Ms.
Pac-Man on his PDA. There's the father-in-law who wants to cook chili
but you bought the wrong beans. There's the cousin who brings her
dog. There are the bad combinations, the corporate muckety-muck uncle
unable to tolerate the social worker brother-in-law. And vice versa.
There are the college kids who bring their friends, including that
poor darling who dropped out to have a baby, but she has a new
boyfriend now, thank God, and is it OK if he comes, too?</TE>
<TE>   But you will forget all of this. All of it. When everyone is gone,
you will sleep for many days and many nights,  and there will be only
happiness left in your heart, a feeling of gratitude for family and
peace and togetherness.</TE>
<TE>   So forget that particular New Year's resolution. Instead, take the
palm of your hand, turn it inward, slap yourself on the forehead and
ask yourself: "Why do you think they call it the Holiday Inn?"</TE>

career waiting for you. In fact, almost every subject you learn in
school can be turned into a career working in an ocean environment.</LD>
<TE>   If science and math are your favorite subjects, you could become a
researcher. Researchers travel far and wide to learn more about their
subjects. They study the ingredients of seawater, ocean currents,
marine mammals, sharks and other fish, waves, the effects of
pollution on the marine environment and much more.</TE>
<TE>   If history is your favorite subject, maybe becoming a marine
archeologist or marine historian would suit you. You could work for a
natural history museum and become an expert on how animals and plants
in the ocean have survived millions of years in their watery home. As
a marine archeologist, you could travel all over the world looking
for ancient fossils and bones.</TE>
<TE>   If English is your favorite subject, you might write children's
books or field guides to educate people about the ocean. You could
also do science writing for a leading journal or write documentary
stories for a nature channel.</TE>
<TE>   If art is your favorite subject, maybe a career in underwater
photography, wildlife art, sculpting or filmmaking would interest
you. There are plenty of ways to include the ocean into the art you
create. Remember, art is more than just painting a picture.</TE>
<TE>   To learn more about marine-related careers, check out the links on

<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding "Meditation Camp: 11 Days to an Enlightened You," (Dec.
16): We are all like the person who is looking for his glasses in
every conceivable place he can think of, and then discovers that he's
wearing them. All the searching was not necessary. The moment of
truth came only after he became aware that he was wearing them.</LD>
<LD>   The 11 days of this spiritual camp are a reminder that we are all
searching for something. It might take 11 days to discover that we
can't find what we are looking for because, like the glasses, our
essential self is not missing. Our enlightened nature is right where
it's supposed to be.</LD>
<LD>   Once we see the problem is just that we haven't been able to be
aware of this enlightened nature within us, we  need to bring our
mind back to the present every time it wanders. When we do wander
through the dark forests of our thoughts and worries, we have to come
back to ourselves and understand that there is nothing to fear.</LD>
<TE>   When we finally see we're already complete, we will stop searching
and become more aware when we start to wander from this safe
haven--our enlightened nature.</TE>

<HD>Obsession With Possessions</HD>
<DH>Author Jane Hammerslough says 'dematerializing' doesn't
mean buying less,  but stepping back and recognizing that objects are
just ... objects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNELL GEORGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So the tie "wasn't Barneys."</LD>
<LD>   The sweater "was too suburbs."</LD>
<LD>   The datebook "too last century."</LD>
<TE>   All of it, shucked of its fancy paper and tossed back into the car
trunk, has been booked for a return trip.</TE>
<TE>   "It just wasn't exactly what I wanted.... "</TE>
<TE>   But, asks author Jane Hammerslough, in her tough but witty new
book "Dematerializing: Taming the Power of Possessions" (Perseus
Publishing, 2001), just what is it that we want? And can we get it
through the physical trappings we seek so persistently?</TE>
<TE>   Hammerslough, a journalist--and a recovering materialist--admits
that even after all the deep digging and self-reflection occasioned
by her work on the book, she's backsliding all the time. She says
that she's buffeted, like the rest of us, by all the not-so-hidden
messages swirling through the culture. She, too, is susceptible to
the call to be the Good Mom, the Sexy Partner, the Savvy Working
Woman--each outfitted with top-of-the line, model-of-the moment
accessories to project The Image.</TE>
<TE>   The pressure to buy into a slickly packaged identity is ubiquitous
and obvious. But knowing what's at work, and how the gizmos and
sleight-of-hand are drawing you in, doesn't make resisting any
easier. "I don't know if I necessarily buy less. But I think about it
more," Hammerslough says. And she pays a lot more attention to
behavior that used to be rote. For instance: This particular evening,
just hours away from a soiree, Hammerslough is caught in an
all-too-familiar conundrum: "Now, I'm getting ready for a party ...
standing in front of my closet and I can't help thinking: What am I
trying to project? How accurate is it?" It's learned behavior that's
tough to shake.</TE>
<TE>   Chatting from her Westport, Conn., home between holiday parties
and travel commitments, she says that her research, talking and
writing have kept her focused on the knotty psychology behind our
acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   We think that buying is the problem and vow to shop less. But
buying, she says, certainly isn't a sin unless it is used
persistently to mask perceived flaws or fill empty emotional spaces.
"I don't think it's easy to just stop buying things. It's human [to
acquire things]. But it's when it starts to overwhelm people" that
the problems begin.</TE>
<TE>   In an economic environment that has, in recent years, produced
more bankruptcy cases than college graduates and where storage
facilities rate as one of the fastest growing businesses ("We've
gotta find someplace to stick all that stuff!"), Hammerslough
attempts to make some sense of our competing desires. What is the
shape of our souls undressed, unshod, unlacquered? "There is an awful
lot of tension and stress devoted to stuff," she explains. "We put so
much energy in it. And it can really mess up our lives."</TE>
<TE>   Hammerslough, who has worked as a magazine writer and as columnist
for the New York Post and other newspapers, winds her way through our
psychological junk drawer, full of all of its hand-me-down debris.
Presenting a comprehensive, briskly paced social history of Americans
and their spending practices, she fills out facts and figures with
examples plucked from history, literature and pop culture--from F.
Scott Fitzgerald to "Friends"--illustrating how and why Americans
spend and consume, and how our values have been upended and tipped
askew.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there is a machine at work--with all of its behavioral
studies, subliminal advertising and marketing research--that keeps
the race toward "more" moving forward. "We receive 3,000 marketing
messages every day," Hammerslough says, many of which effectively
undermine our attempts to retreat into a simpler life, often with
products aimed at helping us acquire a simpler life.</TE>
<TE>   Americans gorge themselves on things that they hope will
counteract the onslaught of everything from stress to guilt to
nostalgia. Things may not make us better, but they make us feel
better, safer, more connected to our pasts. Web sites offer to help
you find not just an old book, but "the very book you lost on a bus
in your youth." And "walk-into-the-past stores," where every object
has a story, milk this sentimental snapshot of the past.</TE>
<TE>   Materialism or, as she calls it, "materializing," Hammerslough
explains, has grown from one of the basic devices of myth and
miracles: "Manna appeared in the desert to save the starving. Loaves
and fishes multiplied to feed the hungry.... We've had countless
stories of transformation, where something bad turns good and
something good gets better," she writes. "Our fables illustrate
fulfillment of especially unlikely possibility--capturing the moment
when hope becomes reality. And if magic manifests itself in something
tangible, well then, isn't the object magical too?"</TE>
<TE>   The belongings that clutter up our lives aren't just props, as
Hammerslough suggests, "They're characters."</TE>
<TE>   They're also our ambassadors and emissaries: That
bells-and-whistles SUV, we think, can speak volumes as we roll around
town. That light-catching wristwatch can project ambition we have yet
to articulate. That calfskin and nickel briefcase can be a VIP pass
to the future. Oh, and that retro hammock and Adirondack chair? Those
could be keys to the past that we somehow want to make better.
Possessions come to symbolize dreams, new starts and second chances.</TE>
<TE>   And, Hammerslough suggests, sometimes they replace them. Somehow,
in the midst of all of the hunting and gathering that carries us from
season to season, year after year, many of us lose track of just what
we are really seeking.</TE>
<TE>   Hammerslough had the overwhelming sense that the space between
"having" and "being" was swiftly closing. "I was listening to a woman
say, 'I love my lifestyle, but I hate my life.' I thought, 'Man!
Whoa!' If you looked [at this woman], you were looking at what we
consider the standards: Attractive. Thin. Had great jewelry. A great
car." But no matter what she was projecting in tangibles,
Hammerslough reflects, "it was the despair I was hearing. If you
stripped away everything, what loneliness! It was so sad to me.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had just incredible wealth over the last 10 years.
Unbelievable. And we were lucky," she says. But a pervasive, constant
sense of dissatisfaction despite our material comfort set off all
kinds of alarms for her. "The problem is when you can't see what you
have and you keep looking somewhere on the horizon."</TE>
<TE>   The pursuit of objects imbues them with "the promise of power,"
but "dematerializing," explains Hammerslough, involves stepping and
stripping away, recognizing objects for what they are--objects.</TE>
<TE>   What she began to glean in her research was that there is
something almost cinematic about the ways we tweak and embroider the
narratives of our lives, too often allowing sets to stand in for plot
and character. Stripping away all of the soft focus and backlighting,
she explains how and why we fall under the spell of advertisements
and into lock-step of consumerism--even when we think we're
impervious to it. The "all the management women have this coat" spiel
gets under our skin if we hear it often enough. And, "serving the
high-fiber cereal will make me a good parent"--even if I don't spend
enough time at home--is a message that works on our guilt. The
messages we absorb now suggest not only how we're supposed to look,
but also who we're supposed to be to fit in. "The promise of
belonging," she says, "is potent."</TE>
<TE>   But, asks Hammerslough, does the desire belong shape personality
and behavior more than the personal ethics and rugged individualism
of the past? There are increasing signs that it does, she says. The
act of buying what you hope to become, once it reaches an almost
religious fervor, is like creative visualization gone awry--it's
wishful thinking. And ultimately, Hammerslough says, it erodes our
values and our social and moral standards.</TE>
<TE>   In its habit-forming rush, materialism encroaches on one's more
important values. When objects become answers, they get in the way of
growth. "I think when you focus on the short-term--the next
purchase--it blocks you from developing a real plan," Hammerslough
says. Coming up with a life plan, a real sense of  where you're
going, "takes a lot of time and attention. [Nonstop consuming] is
like playing a video game rather than reading a book. You need
balance. Sometimes you have to sit down and read the book."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, against the stormy backdrop of a skittish economy and
the brave new world of Homeland Security, Hammerslough, just like the
rest of us, has heard the first strains of the a mantra "I want to
live a deeper life."</TE>
<TE>   Just what that means, though, particularly in this moment when the
nation and its priorities are in flux, is tough to discern. The
messages from our elected officials, the president on down, say,
"Buoy the economy! Help America! Shop!" But the message from our
hearts and souls has been to ask: "What is all of this for?"</TE>
<TE>   "I think what we're understanding is that horrible things happened
and there is nothing that can protect you," Hammerslough says. "I
don't want people not to buy things but, rather, to really consider
what you want to buy and what you're bringing to this purchase." Joy,
Hammerslough says, isn't something you can hunt down. It comes from
within. Her suggestions to help readers begin to reorder the chaos,
to "dematerialize" might feel like Sunday homilies or mother's words:
Engage in the process. The idea is to snap a "sense picture" of joy,
of peace of pure happiness that "exists outside the props of
possessions."</TE>
<TE>   "I get sick of these people who are whining about contemporary
culture," Hammerslough says. "The greatest power is to challenge it.
While I might not be able to change the culture," Hammerslough says,
"I can certainly change how I react to it."</TE>

<HD>For 2002, a Word From Palindromists: Yay</HD>
<DH>Backward-and-forward aficionados are excited about the
oh-so reversible year--'a thing of beauty.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RENEE TAWA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You get a bit punchy in Jon Agee's through-the-looking-glass kind of
world. He peruses the New Yorker from back cover to front. He flips
over the cool reversible name, Anuta Catuna. (She won the New York
City Marathon's women's title in 1996.) He throws a party and gets
the band to play songs with melodies and lyrics that read the same,
forward and backward--a play on words known as a palindrome.</LD>
<LD>   Which means that Agee, the author of noted collections of original
palindromes, is celebrating--really seeing the happy backwardness
in--the year 2002. "This year has to be the killer party," says Agee,
who also collects palindromes. (Someone, quick, come up with tunes
besides the Spanish song "Somos o No Somos," which means "We Are or
We Aren't"; the song's melody and lyrics also are reversible.)</LD>
<LD>   If you think Agee is partying, think about that wacky subset, the
"numbers palindromists," who have to be reveling in the thrilling
proximity of 1991 and 2002. The last time two palindromic years
occurred so close together was in 999 and 1001. This is their time to
go crazy on us; the next reversible year isn't until 2112.</LD>
<TE>   In the past few months, the Palindromist magazine (www
.realchange.org/pal) has received hundreds of e-mails, including
submissions and buzz about the upcoming banner year. Its
Portland-based editor, Mark Saltveit, attributes the upswing to the
look of "2002"--so symmetrical, so rounded in a pleasing Rubens-esque
way. "2002 just speaks for itself," says Saltveit, a stand-up
comedian and computer-skills trainer. "It's a thing of beauty. An
aesthetic joy."</TE>
<TE>   The 5-year-old magazine, which has 200 to 500 subscribers around
the world, is published once or twice a year. Saltveit also has
published a 2002 date book that includes his palindromes, as well as
the work of others, such as Leigh Mercer's 1914 classic: "A man, a
plan, a canal--Panama!"</TE>
<TE>   The calendar features trivia--the oldest known palindrome is in
Latin and dates back to 79 AD--and historical tidbits about, say, the
former Yreka Bakery in Yreka, Calif. Notable events in the
palindromic world are pointed out on the appropriate day; the Oct. 8
entry notes the 1991 release date for an EP by the dark Seattle
grunge band, Soundgarden: "Satan, Oscillate My Metallic Sonatas."
Saltveit also spotlights recent favorites such as the one for May 21,
National Waitstaff Day: "Stressed? No Tips? Spit on Desserts,"
written by Tom Comerford.</TE>
<TE>   Silly, yes, Saltveit says. But maybe the coming year's hoopla will
encourage wordplay enthusiasts to create not just funny palindromes
but ones that are more like haikus, thought provoking or imbued with
meaning.</TE>
<TE>   A fan sent this deep palindrome to author Agee: "Do geese see
God?" It's hard to come up with such a sentence, Agee says. "It's
almost like carving out a little jewel." (Tips are available in books
such as Michael Donner's palindrome encyclopedia, published in 1996
by Algonquin Books, with the tricky title: "I Love Me, Vol. I.")</TE>
<TE>   Agee, who lives in New York City, is an acclaimed illustrator and
writer of children's books (" ... unidirectional picture books," he
specifies on one book jacket). His recent offering, "Milo's Hat
Trick" (Hyperion/di Capua), is on The Times' list of Best Books of
2001 for children. "I love words," he says. "The palindrome is the
perfect kind of recreational, mind-bending, visually stimulating
phenomenon for me."</TE>
<TE>   Agee uses illustrations to bring his palindromes to life. In one
cartoon, he shows two nuns in a bar. One nun, who has a golf club,
says to the other, who is about to sip her gin: "Flo, gin is a sin. I
golf."</TE>
<TE>   In talks at schools, Agee shows students samples from his three
illustrated collections of palindromes as a way "to get kids excited
about language.... It's sort of like a magic trick." His collections
include, "So Many Dynamos!" (Farrar Straus &amp; Giroux, 1994), which
sells for, guess what, $13.31.</TE>
<TE>   His book, "Palindromania!" is due in fall 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kicking myself, wishing it came out earlier," Agee says.
"There'll be so many things about palindromes that people will be
sick of them."</TE>
<TE>   (Or maybe they will hold out for the next volume that he is
considering of off-color palindromes: "Sex at Noon Taxes." )</TE>

<HD>Weight-Loss Goals: No More Pie in the Sky</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandy Banks</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With any luck, the last of the sweet potato pie will be gone by
tonight. We will have devoured all of Allie's waffle cookies and
emptied the tin of Christmas fudge. Nothing but crumbs will be left
of the pound cake my mother-in-law sent from Ohio.</LD>
<LD>   Only then can I begin in earnest abiding by my New Year's
resolution to, once again, (drum roll, please) lose a little weight
this year.</LD>
<LD>   I'm not asking to be a size 2 again. I'd be happy to lose the 10
pounds that federal health officials have called on each of us to
drop as a measure of our patriotism. That might not make me look like
Halle Berry, but it would avail me of an entire wardrobe of dresses
and pants that I've had to shove to the back of my closet because I
can't breathe when I fasten them.</LD>
<TE>   It's not that I'm a glutton, but that I eat more than I exercise.
Count me among the two out of three Americans who don't get the
surgeon general-prescribed 30 minutes of daily exercise--enough to
trim 10 pounds a year.</TE>
<TE>   Surgeon General David Satcher says our national tilt toward
obesity is threatening our country's well-being. Six of every 10
Americans are overweight, he says, and most of us are far too
sedentary. But it's hard to muster the energy to exercise when you're
recovering from the stultifying effects of a weeklong holiday food
orgy. And it's harder still to resist the notion that you really
can--as the advertisements claim--lose weight while you sit, watch TV
or sleep.</TE>
<TE>   This is the time of year when we're bombarded with pitches for gym
memberships, diet pills and exercise gear. It's easy to be seduced by
the "new you" they promise, but harder to make that reality. The
problem is you have to make time for the gym, diet pills are apt to
lighten little more than your wallet, and exercise machines can, if
you're not careful, do more harm than good to out-of-shape physiques.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the people they show demonstrating the equipment on TV,"
says Ro DiBrezzo, a professor of exercise science at the University
of Arkansas. "You very seldom see an older adult or someone who's
overweight using the product. That should be red flag No. 1."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, they don't use aerobics teachers and muscle-bound
guys with washboard abs on their commercials because that's how
you'll look when you're done working out, but because those are the
only folks with the strength and coordination to make these
weight-loss contraptions work.</TE>
<TE>   Some of us have to learn that the hard way. There's an entire
cabinet in my garage devoted to exercise gadgets, purchased with the
best of intentions, then cast aside before they whittled away even an
inch from my waist or subtracted a pound from my thighs. Like the
rubber-band gizmo that promised washboard abs in just three minutes a
day. It took me 30 minutes to figure out how to loop Rubber Band A
through Notch C, and the assembly process left me so exhausted I had
no energy left for the exercise routine.</TE>
<TE>   DiBrezzo says we ought to steer clear of those trendy body shapers
and invest instead in tried-and-true exercise machines--stationary
bikes or treadmills. But an unused treadmill is a lot harder than "Ab
Magic" to stash unseen in the back of a cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   And I suspect that the mocking reminder of a stationary bike just
gathering dust would make me feel like such a failure, I'd wind up
eating more to assuage my guilt.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, DiBrezzo says, most of us would be better off joining
a gym and stoking our motivation by exercising with a friend. The
last time I tried that, I wound up putting on five pounds. It was not
the gym that did it, but those post-workout stops at Starbucks, where
we rewarded ourselves for our industry with a couple of venti lattes
... with nonfat milk and just a dab of whipped cream.</TE>
<TE>   In our family, the dawn of a new year has always been associated
with food. As a kid, I spent the holiday at a family buffet at the
home of Aunt Ida and Uncle Butch. He was the head cook at a Catholic
boys' school. She supplied local bakeries with homemade pastries.</TE>
<TE>   Together, they ran a catering business. You can imagine what New
Year's Day dinner was like.</TE>
<TE>   We'd eat ourselves into a stupor, sleep it off on the sofa, then
eat some more. Football, card games, the Rose Parade ... those were
all secondary to main attractions like fried chicken, mashed
potatoes, seven-layer cake and honey-glazed ham.</TE>
<TE>   When we finished, we kids would waddle around, mimicking adults
who, stuffed to the gills, would rub their bellies and dutifully
announce, "Whoo, that was some dinner! Tomorrow, I'm going to have to
start my diet."</TE>
<TE>   Well, tomorrow is here. And I'm keeping this New Year's resolution
simple: Eat less. Walk more. And if all else fails, buy bigger
clothes.</TE>

<HD>Smithsonian Expands Its Vision</HD>
<DH>Exhibition in 2003 will be first step in establishing a
National Center for Photography.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JO ANN LEWIS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Despite the prospect of millions of dollars in budget cuts, the
Smithsonian Institution has great news for photography fans. It has
launched a new initiative which, if it succeeds, will create a
National Center for Photography at the museum complex.</LD>
<LD>   The idea, quietly hatched by Smithsonian photography curator Merry
Foresta, will surface in May 2003: the first general survey of the
Smithsonian's trove of 13 million photographs, at the Arts and
Industries Building.</LD>
<LD>   Foresta is selecting "At First Sight: Photography and the American
Imagination, Treasures of Smithsonian Photography" from 600 separate
photograph collections housed in the Smithsonian's 17 museums. Often
little-known outside their various disciplines--and never before
examined across the board--these images were acquired to serve many
purposes, including art, science, history, anthropology, astronomy,
zoology, medicine and engineering.</LD>
<TE>   There are bridges, railroads, empresses, shahs, nude male models
riding bareback, Amelia Earhart with her airplanes and Jesse James
and his dandified gang posing in derby hats.</TE>
<TE>   The show, if it succeeds, will be the first step toward
establishing the National Center for Photography, a longtime dream of
Foresta's, who was curator of photography at the Smithsonian American
Art Museum before being detailed to this initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "For years, I've felt--along with several other Smithsonian
curators--that something needed to be done to preserve the various
photographic collections in the Smithsonian, and to make them more
accessible," Foresta says. "They've been underutilized because no one
really knew what was there."</TE>
<TE>   The center would serve as both a real and a virtual portal to the
photo collections within the Smithsonian. It will also have an
exhibition space and education center. Exactly where remains to be
seen.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one thing to brag about 13 million photos; it's another
thing to see to their overall care and feeding," Foresta says.</TE>
<TE>   Foresta's office walls are covered with photocopies of the images
she's considering--amazing, curious and wonderful things that give an
idea of the breadth and richness of the Smithsonian's holdings.</TE>
<TE>   From the Air and Space Museum is an 1880s wedding portrait showing
newlyweds in a hot-air balloon. From the Sackler Gallery archive, the
strange image of the last empress dowager of China (1835-1908) with
her 6-inch-long nails.</TE>
<TE>   There are American curiosities, such as the Civil War officer in
full-dress uniform, exposing his abdominal wound for the benefit of
medical science. And there are exotic, haunting images, such as the
Sackler's "Veiled Woman With Pearls," a woman barely visible behind a
gauzy covering, made about 1890 by the superb Persian court
photographer Antoin Sevruguin.</TE>
<TE>   "The Smithsonian was the first American museum to form a
collection devoted to photography," Foresta says. "And the first
keeper of photographs, Thomas Smillie, was a visionary who believed
that photos had to be collected for their own value, as well as for
their function in certain divisions."</TE>
<TE>   In 1912, Smillie contacted Alfred Stieglitz, the great
photographer and avant-garde New York art dealer, and asked him to
assemble a collection representing the best contemporary
photographers. Stieglitz sent important prints by himself, Edward
Steichen, Baron de Meyer, Frederick Evans, Octavius Hill, Clarence
White--27 framed images in all. Total cost, $200.</TE>
<TE>   Smillie also purchased for the Smithsonian the camera equipment of
Samuel Morse, the inventor who introduced photography to America in
1840, a year after its discovery. "It's amazing to know that
photography came to America just two years before the Smithsonian was
founded," Foresta says. "That technology and this institution have
been joined from the start."</TE>
<TE>   The works Smillie collected became part of the National Museum of
American History's department of photo history, perhaps the most
visible part of the Smithsonian's photographic collections until
1983, when Foresta began collecting and exhibiting photographs at the
American Art Museum.</TE>
<TE>   "By the late '70s, the story of photography was increasingly being
told by art museums," Foresta says. "Now all the art museums have
them, and photographs have become objects in themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "What we need to do now is to take photography out of the
preciousness of the art world. Most of these photographs were made
for a utilitarian purpose; it's a recent notion that they're only
art."</TE>
<TE>   What Foresta needs now is someone willing to donate $3 million in
seed money. Without that, she says, the center can't happen.</TE>

<LD>"Hey, I found one!" Izzy squealed, pinching the stem of a four-leaf
clover.</LD>
<LD>   She slid it into her pocket for safekeeping.</LD>
<LD>   "C'mon, Lance, let's go," she said, anxious to show off her rare
prize. But Lance was busy snapping at a swarm of butterflies
fluttering about his head.</LD>
<TE>   "Rro, rro, rro, rro," he yapped, flicking his tail.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly a familiar rattle sent Izzy and Lance flying to the curb.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey y'all," said Vera, with her familiar Southern drawl. The
carrier sorted through a handful of envelopes, then handed Izzy the
day's mail. There was no letter from Grammy.</TE>
<TE>   "Rro, rro, rro, rro," Lance yapped again.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't fergetcha, boy," said Vera, laughing and hopping out of
the jeep. She reached behind the seat for a box of doggie biscuits.</TE>
<TE>   Lance shot his wet nose skyward as she dangled a beefy biscuit
high above his head.</TE>
<TE>   "Here ya go, fella," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything for me, Vera? I mean m'am," said Izzy, remembering her
manners.</TE>
<TE>   Vera leaned into a large plastic bin.</TE>
<TE>   "Here ya go, darlin'," she said, handing Izzy a small brown
package.</TE>
<TE>   Lance sat on his hind legs, begging for seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "Sorry, fella. Only one per customer," she said, patting his head.
"Gotta run." She waved goodbye as the jeep rattled down the country
road.</TE>

<HD>Extra-Large Costume Drama</HD>
<DH>The World Wrestling Federation has four designers who
enhance the tough-guy and -gal images for the bigger-than-life
characters filling the ring.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURIE K. SCHENDEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Can I use your sewing machine?" asked the burly 6-foot-7, 350-pound
Matt Bloom. These are not words wrestling fans would expect to hear
from one known to them as Phat Albert, one of the snarling superstars
of the World Wrestling Federation. Imagine a guy with fingers the
size of kielbasas trying to thread a needle to alter his spandex cap.</LD>
<LD>   "No, I'll do it," costume designer Julie Drozdov replied backstage
at a recent show at the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim. After all, a
girl's got to protect her turf. She sewed the cap.</LD>
<LD>   A grateful Phat Albert is now stage-ready, looking every inch the
tough guy in a muscle shirt, black spandex pants, the cap and
assorted silver studs piercing his nose, one ear and face.</LD>
<TE>   Drozdov, 31, is one of four costume designers who make sure the
big guys--and wrestling gals--get their performance duds right. She
made her first wrestling costume in 1988, the year she graduated from
a Chicago high school. Drozdov was a seamstress bored with making
bridesmaid dresses, who liked watching the WWF on late-night TV.</TE>
<TE>   She noticed two wrestlers in particular, known as the Rockers, who
wore drab leotards. When the federation came to town, she and her
three sisters made new costumes for the pair. "I thought they were
cute, and I wanted to meet them," she explained.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of a security guard, the sisters got their "couture"
to the wrestlers. The Rockers liked the look and hired the girls to
make more. Other wrestlers, tired of sewing their own costumes,
placed orders with the sisters, who were hired by the WWF in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Drozdov and her sister, Terry Anderson, are still at it,
now working with Yolanda Warren and Diane Murell. The four are
constantly coming up with new designs for monthly pay-per-view
events. Each designer is typically responsible for 15 wrestlers,
which means about 180 costumes a year per designer.</TE>
<TE>   For the uninitiated, at least half the drama in pro wrestling is
set outside the ring. The matches are as much about
storytelling--characters and plot lines--as they are about
wrestling--sort of a cross between "The Rocky Horror Picture Show"
and "Days of Our Lives." In fact, you can follow the thrills, spats
and, yes, romances (with WWF Divas), on the wwf.com Web site, where
the action is recapped a la Soap Opera Digest.</TE>
<TE>   Vince McMahon, WWF chief executive officer and a sometime
wrestler, creates a persona for each of the wrestlers. Though some
wrestlers concoct their own looks, the designers create clothes that
help define most of the characters. There's the Rock, the movie-star
hero with his bull logo emblazoned on the behind of his traditional
shorts; rotund Rikishi in his faux Japanese ceremonial garb; and the
Undertaker, who favors bandanas and black leather and arrives in the
arena atop a motorcycle. The Hurricane is a caped crusader; Chris
Jericho favors flashy sequined pants.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest challenge, Drozdov said, is to get the costumes to
fit. "The girls are all built like Barbie dolls, the guys are huge,"
she said. One year, "Chyna kept wanting her leather pants really,
really tight. As soon as she got out to the ring for her match, the
zipper broke," Drozdov recalled. After that, it seemed that in every
pay-per-view show with Chyna, there "was something: Her top would
bust open or the snaps would come undone."</TE>
<TE>   Fabrics with a little give--Ultraleather, spandex and stretch
denim--allow the athletes to leap from the ropes, slam to the mat or
flip through the air in the ring. The designers have more creative
flexibility for scenes taped outside the ring. Rikishi, for example,
wears an elaborate black satin kimono made especially for him, over
the spandex underwear he wears in the ring.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Michaels, a semiretired wrestler, is Drozdov's favorite
wrestler to dress. "I could do anything and he'd wear it," she says.
"I've made things out of plastic, one [costume] was made out of the
fabric they use in screen doors.... Once I shopped at a hardware
store and made a jacket out of hinges."</TE>
<TE>   For designer Warren, one of her toughest assignments is Kurt
Angle, who uses his real-life experience as the 1996 Olympic gold
medal winner in freestyle wrestling for his WWF persona. "How many
ways can you do red, white and blue?" she asked. "Somehow we manage
to make them all different."</TE>
<TE>   Logo designs are almost as important as costumes to some wrestlers
who earn a percentage of sales from merchandise with their logos.
Backstage at the Pond, Triple H happily examined his new silver, red
and black "H" logo, which Drozdov just applied to a jean jacket. The
WWF staff tried to come up with a new logo for him, H explained, but
"they screwed it up. Julie made it look cool."</TE>
<TE>   The most grueling event of the year is WrestleMania, the Super
Bowl of wrestling, coming up in March. Some wrestlers won't know if
they will compete until a couple weeks or even days before the event.
But Drozdov, who is married to former wrestler Darren Drozdov, likes
the pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't consider this a job," she said. "It's like having 40 big
brothers around."</TE>
<TE>   Really big brothers.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ayear ago, health care and education reform topped our traditional
New Year's wish list. Today, the tasks of making Americans smarter
and healthier are still critical, but secondary to keeping them safe
and stabilizing the international order. Here are our hopes and
suggested resolutions for 2002.</LD>
<LD>   A Safer Nation</LD>
<LD>   * We hope U.S. soldiers will be safe and successful in their
continued mission in Afghanistan and wherever else the nation sends
them to fight terrorists. With that in mind, we wish American leaders
wisdom and courage. We hope that Osama bin Laden is found quickly,
dead or alive, and that Mullah Mohammed Omar is forced to answer for
his destructive theology.</LD>
<TE>   * We hope that the success of domestic law enforcement agencies in
protecting the nation from follow-up attacks continues but suggest
that Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft resolve to back away from using the
terrorist threat as a pretext for dangerous moves against civil
rights.</TE>
<TE>   * Congress has authorized more than $3 billion to fight
bioterrorism, and we hope it will not be directed too narrowly at
such necessary but incomplete fixes as smallpox vaccine production.
Health experts also agree that money must go to clinics and hospitals
for equipment and to train staffs to recognize and treat the effects
of biological and chemical weapons.</TE>
<TE>   * We wish the government would stop dawdling on airline security.
Will it take another day like Sept. 11 before lawmakers meet demands
that checked-bag safety measures, new screening technology and
federalized security staffs be put in place nationwide?</TE>
<TE>   A More Stable World</TE>
<TE>   * We wish the interim government well as it rebuilds a shattered
Afghanistan. May music fill the nation's  airwaves and may kites fill
its  sky.</TE>
<TE>   * We hope Pakistan's crackdown on militant groups assuages India,
reducing tensions that have become explosive.</TE>
<TE>   * For Russia, we wish President Vladimir V. Putin would hold more
town hall--type meetings with his fellow citizens. Topping his
resolution list should be: "Jail fewer journalists on trumped-up
charges, and ease the grip on the levers of power."</TE>
<TE>   * In the Middle East, we wish for the political will on both sides
to resume dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   *  We hope China's entry into the World Trade Organization will
make it less likely to persecute its own citizens and more willing to
work with other nations to combat the theft of intellectual property.</TE>
<TE>   * We wish Argentina a democratic, non-demogogic solution to its
current crisis, with increased help from Italy and Spain, whose
immigrants did the most to shape the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Well-Educated Children</TE>
<TE>   * We wish Washington the strength to hold states accountable for
bringing students up to tough testing standards, as prescribed by
last year's landmark education law, a smart compromise pushed by
President Bush and supported by both Democrats and Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   * We hope the $8-billion increase in federal spending on K-12
education is used wisely and wish for even more money to allow
principals in the most challenged schools to hire the best teachers
and reduce class sizes.</TE>
<TE>   * Let California resolve to keep a sharp focus on improving the
quality of teachers and recruiting more of them. Start by expanding
programs such as the state's excellent summer academies for reading
and algebra teachers, making it easier for experienced teachers from
other states to become certified. We hope too for further improvement
of teacher education throughout the California State University
system, which produces most of the state's teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Better Health</TE>
<TE>   * We hope that legislators stop turning a blind eye to mental
health: Congress should pass a bill by Sens. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.)
and Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.) that would prohibit insurers from
discriminating against mental illness--requiring them to offer the
same co-payments and deductibles for schizophrenia as for influenza.</TE>
<TE>   * In Sacramento, we wish Gov. Gray Davis and senators would press
Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) to allow a
vote on "Laura's law," a sensible bill by Assemblywoman Helen Thomson
(D-Davis) that would give mental health professionals the resources
and authority to compel seriously mentally ill people to receive
treatment when they don't realize they need it.</TE>
<TE>   * We hope the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which spent
most of 2001 searching for the right person to run its ailing health
services department, will step out of the way and allow Dr. Thomas L.
Garthwaite to revive the county's system of hospitals and clinics.
The supervisors should finally adopt long-standing recommendations to
create a health care authority to oversee the department and remove
themselves from daily operation.</TE>
<TE>   Stronger Safety Nets</TE>
<TE>   * We hope that Washington, which was right to put time limits on
public assistance, will now relax those deadlines in response to
economic pressures. A booming economy helped thousands--mostly single
mothers--leave welfare, but many of them now face unemployment
because of an economic downturn made worse by the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   * With federal action on an economic stimulus plan stalled, the
California Legislature should make the increase in unemployment
benefits that it passed last year retroactive to Sept. 11, something
the governor backs. The $100 increase, to a maximum of a mere $330 a
week, otherwise kicks in after next Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Better Politics</TE>
<TE>   * When Congress reconvenes, we hope fervently for passage (at long
last) of real campaign finance reform. After numerous sudden deaths,
Congress has never been closer. Supporters of reform are now only
three votes shy of forcing a full floor vote. While the bill would
not close every avenue for moneyed interests, it does regulate the
flow of so-called soft money into campaign coffers. It's time to
tackle this end run around democracy.</TE>
<TE>   * We hope California candidates abide by the spirit as well as the
letter of the state campaign reform law and that rather than delay
and fudge they will immediately post on Web sites, and with the
state, details of their campaign contributions and expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   * We wish the state a crisp, clean, fair 2002 election campaign
(sigh) on real issues, free of political attacks and hit pieces. We
urge candidates to resolve to tell the truth, even if that means
answering a question by saying, "I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   A Better State</TE>
<TE>   * We wish for a serious, straightforward 2002 legislative session.
With the effects of the terrorist attack rippling through an economy
that already was on shaky ground, the state is left with an estimated
$12-billion revenue shortfall. To make hard choices that the
shortfall demands, we need cooperation between Gov. Davis and
Democratic leaders in the Legislature and between Democrats and
Republicans in the Assembly and Senate.</TE>
<TE>   * We hope Davis and Democratic leaders will agree to a compromise
that allows bonds to be issued so the state can recoup billions of
dollars spent for electricity purchase contracts--expenditures that
now deepen the economic crisis.</TE>
<TE>   * We wish Congress and the state Legislature success in
implementing California's plan to live within its annual allotment of
4.4 million acre-feet of Colorado River water over the next 15 years.
That includes getting farmers and cities to see their mutual needs
better.</TE>
<TE>   A Better City</TE>
<TE>   * We hope that Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, already the steady
administrator that voters expected, will also become a strong
advocate with a clear vision for a great city. With the question of
the San Fernando Valley splitting from Los Angeles likely to appear
on a ballot in November, the future of Los Angeles is at stake.</TE>
<TE>   * We hope the Los Angeles City Council will stop bickering and
plotting and make something substantial happen--and we don't mean
sappy proposals to paint the Hollywood sign red, white and blue or to
get rid of term limits after half the council members sworn in last
July were elected because of them.</TE>
<TE>   * We wish Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks and police
union President Mitzi Grasso would wolf down some harmony pills.
Management and labor rarely get along, but battling between Parks and
the Police Protective League impedes necessary reform of the
department.</TE>
<TE>   * Finally, as a new year dawns, we'd love to see a good deal more
humor and an outbreak of self-deprecation among those in public life.
Happy 2002.</TE>

<HD>Burbank's Airport Vote Risks Passenger Safety</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "The 'Air Safety Is No. 2' City," editorial, Dec. 26: The Burbank
City Council did not "deny a request by Southwest Airlines to move a
wall in the old terminal to make room for increased, federally
required baggage searches." By a 3-2 vote, the City Council simply
refused to take up the request as an "urgency item" even though
federal law requires that all checked luggage be inspected by Jan.
18, 2002. Even though the action was a postponement, not a denial,
the council richly deserves criticism for potentially imperiling
airline security and passenger safety. Far from failing to stand up
to "real or imagined irate voters," the three council members voting
down the request for immediate action were blatantly attempting to
provoke a lawsuit by Southwest Airlines.</LD>
<LD>   I am a longtime critic of Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport
expansion and one of those who helped successfully pass Measure A,
which placed conditions on airport growth. I spoke in favor of the
Southwest plans. It was my opinion (and that of Restore Our Airport
Rights supporters) that reconfiguring additional space for security
reasons did not fall within the provisions of the measure. Southwest
Airlines and the airport were responding to a federal mandate to
inspect all checked luggage. They were not expanding the terminal to
add additional flights or passengers.</LD>
<TE>   Measure A was written and scheduled for the ballot long before the
events of Sept. 11. Even so, supporters believe as fervently in the
measure today as we did then. The issue of airport growth is separate
from airline terrorism concerns. Unrestricted growth without
protections against noise, pollution and other negative impacts is
being debated all over the U.S. Three members of the council would
have you believe they are merely appeasing residents on the issue of
growth by thwarting federal mandates on luggage checking. Their
actions speak otherwise. If you read their Request for Declaratory
Judgment you will understand that they are demanding the courts
declare Measure A to be entirely unenforceable.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "More Fitting Name for Swing Voters: Airheads," Dec. 28:</LD>
<LD>   I read John Balzar's columns and enjoy them, but he seems to have
worked himself into a lather this time. Lather takes lots of air. But
I guess I'm one of the airheads. Though I wouldn't qualify based on
his certainty that these airheads don't read. Hmm. I read the L.A.
Times, the Register and Investor's Business Daily every day and the
Washington Post once a week, besides the Atlantic Monthly, Harper's
and the New Yorker. Perhaps I'm overinformed and that is why I don't
join the Republican or the Democratic club of "vote your party
because it must be right." They propose platforms that they promptly
throw away after the election.</LD>
<LD>   No, all politicians aren't the same, but until there is some sort
of campaign reform, you might as well vote the man and hope that you
did the right thing. I've walked blocks, written letters, made
donations and done everything but run for office to try to get some
"good politicians" in office. But like the rest of the airheads, I'll
wait to see what these guys and gals have to say before I'll commit
to a vote. And yes, John, it does become discouraging. I don't
believe in blind allegiance. Every year I get closer and closer to
not voting.</LD>

<LD>Re "Family Torn Asunder in Battle With Government," Dec. 28: Poor Ana
Maria, Violeta and Artemisa Tecla Parra. They became urban terrorists
("revolutionaries") and wound up "missing." What a surprise! My heart
aches for them because, after all, they only joined when "a small
band of leftist revolutionaries turned to kidnapping, robbery and
violence in hopes of overthrowing an entire system of government."</LD>
<LD>   Violeta tried to murder the agent who was arresting her . . . and
then she disappeared. Go figure! Instead of invoking sympathy, your
series of articles regarding the "missing" teaches only that people
suffer the consequences for their choices and their actions.</LD>

<LD>In times like these when evil may live in the house next door, we
need to look to the wisest of our nation in order to keep hope and
courage strong. Mel Brooks has said that the only way to attack
hatred is with ridicule, and I think he is right. Therefore I
recommend some slight changes in how we refer to the following:</LD>
<LD>   Richard Reid--Abdul bin Hotfoot.</LD>
<LD>   Al Qaeda--''The Al Qaeda Network--all the caves, all the time.''</LD>
<TE>   The Taliban--the Turned-Tail-and-Ran.</TE>
<TE>   Osama bin Laden--Osama bin-to-Kmart-looking-for-a-burka-in-tall.</TE>

tacos.</TE>

<HD>Teaching Dissent and Dissenting on Teaching</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Nothing Wrong With Teaching What's Right About U.S." (Opinion, Dec.
30) is a breath of fresh air for our universities, where a majority
of intellectuals have failed to observe our history with balance and
dispassion. They have viewed scholars such as Stephen Ambrose with
contempt because he looks at both the good and bad about America. I
have long noted that our university system acts like a concentration
camp system where only one political worldview is accepted: that
"America's relations with the Third World are essentially wicked and
that our country's domestic history can only be understood as a
continuing battle over race, class and gender."</LD>
<LD>   How many actually teach what America's values are, how they are
represented in our Constitution and how we act upon them? The 1st
Amendment is not extended to those who differ with the worldview and
who think that "there is much good in what we do and stand for." I
hope that balance is returning and scholars will in the future have a
wider and more healthy perspective.</LD>

<TE>   Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman appropriately emphasizes that we
university professors should teach what is right about the U.S. as
well as its failings, and perhaps some academics in their eagerness
to present criticisms have failed to do so. But, as Joel Beinin ("An
Obligation to Question Prevailing Wisdom") points out, the purpose of
higher education is to teach the capacity to think and analyze, to
take a critical stance toward society and the actions of government.
The role of a citizen in a democracy is to question, not simply to
accept what authority presents.</TE>
<TE>   So it seems the obligation of the academy is to examine with a
critical eye the actions of our government in the present crisis. It
is particularly important since, with some notable exceptions, there
has been virtually no questioning of policies by the mainstream
media. There has been no serious discussion of the alternatives to
war, the role the U.S. should have vis-a-vis the United Nations, the
extension of military activities beyond Afghanistan or the serious
repression of dissent and undermining of rights by the
administration. Instead, even to raise such questions is said by the
attorney general to be unpatriotic. On the contrary, it is in accord
with our country's highest ideals to question; this is the way we can
best honor our heritage as Americans.</TE>

<TE>   Hoffman's essay is in fact a confession, long overdue, that fellow
academics have long denigrated and grossly underrated our nation's
goals and performance. Apparently, she has had an awakening since
9/11. It would indeed be an unexpected benefit of our nation's
grievous wounding if the intellectual community could find the
courage to stand up for America. Thank God, some of us in the Great
Unwashed had it right all along.</TE>

<HD>Their 'Person of the Year' Is President Bush</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>America's problem isn't the "enemy," like Osama bin Laden, but
Americans who put partisan politics ahead of their country (letters,
Dec. 28). Because of their hatred for a devoted American, President
Bush, they pretend admiration for New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
use this discussion to slander the president. Bush obviously is
"Person of the Year," rallying a nation and a global community for
freedom, not only a city. Giuliani performed very well and, in
deference to New York, a shared award would have been fair.</LD>
<LD>   Imagine if the American-bashers' choice, Bill Clinton, had been
president on Sept. 11. But we don't have to imagine: For eight years
Clinton slandered America and handled Bin Laden with kid gloves. If
Bush is a "boob," as these "Americans" insist, no newspaper would
print the words that describe Clinton.</LD>

<TE>   Why is it that over 75% of Americans support President Bush in the
war on terrorism, according to several polls, yet over 75% of your
letters are disparaging about Bush? This great difference certainly
indicates a marked liberal bias on the part of the editors of The
Times.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has whipped the Taliban and Al Qaeda in far-off
Afghanistan in about four months, a terrific feat. Bush is "the man."
Giuliani was a high-profile spectator to the Sept. 11 tragedy.
Giuliani may be "Person of the Year" in New York, but my "Person of
the Year" is our commander in chief, President George W. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Charles W. Jenner</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The irony of Time magazine's choice for "Person of the Year" is
that if not for Bin Laden, Giuliani would most likely never have been
considered and President Bush would rank as a maybe. I understand the
emotional reasons for the choice, but it seems to be an example of
the "tail wagging the dog."</TE>

<TE>   We have rained thousands of tons of high-tech ordnance on

in his latest video (Dec. 28). Is this supposed to convince us that
our billions were well spent?</TE>

massacre and concentrate on some more salient issues, namely, Wall
Street's collapse and the state of the American economy?</TE>
<TE>   Now that we've had an opportunity to stimulate the defense
industry, I should think you would like to talk a bit about the
defense industry and its profiteering in this time of conflict.</TE>

credit for the revitalization of our military-industrial complex.</TE>

<HD>Republican Radio Ads Tax Davis' Credibility</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I cannot tell you how amused I am after hearing the new radio
commercials paid for by the California Republican Party that attack
Democratic Gov. Gray Davis (Dec. 28). The commercial attempts to
blame him for squandering a budget surplus, which will result in
higher taxes. I find it ironic for the GOP to take such a stance;
after all, isn't it the party that squandered a huge national budget
surplus with its ill-advised tax relief program?</LD>
<LD>   Furthermore, the commercial conveniently neglects to make any
reference to this year's California energy crisis that was brought
on, in large measure, by the policies of Enron--a major Republican
Party campaign donor that recently declared bankruptcy and will be
the target of numerous congressional hearings. I wonder if those
''compassionate'' little elves in the commercial are still giggling.</LD>

<HD>SEC Plans Fraud Suit Against Aura</HD>
<DH>Securities: Three top executives of the El Segundo firm,
who are among several resigning, also may be charged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission plans to bring a civil fraud
case against Aura Systems Inc. and three top officers, the El
Segundo-based company said in a regulatory filing Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Additionally, Aura's senior management team will resign in
February, taking stock options and one-year consulting contracts in
lieu of severance payments, the company said in the SEC filing.</LD>
<LD>   The planned SEC lawsuit follows a multiyear probe into the
accounting practices of Aura, which has ventured into businesses as
diverse as video game equipment, loudspeakers and fax modems without
making money.</LD>
<TE>   Aura was founded in 1987 by Zvi "Harry" Kurtzman, a former Hughes
Aircraft scientist who said he was going to apply defense technology
to a broad array of civilian products. In fact, Aura made little or
no money and was the subject of lengthy reviews by the SEC. Kurtzman,
Aura's chairman and chief executive, is among those leaving.</TE>
<TE>   The company has lost about $200 million over the last five years.
It sales have plunged from a high of $137 million in 1998 to $2.3
million for its fiscal year ended Feb. 28.</TE>
<TE>   "This separation process will provide the company with the
opportunity to make an orderly transition to a new management team,"
Aura said in its SEC filing. A special committee of the board of
directors will search for new managers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Kurtzman, the officers who agreed to leave include
Gerald Papazian, the firm's president, and Arthur Schwartz, an
executive vice president.</TE>
<TE>   Also resigning, the company said, is Cipora Kurtzman-Lavut, a
senior vice president and sister of Kurtzman. Neal Kaufman, another
senior vice president, and Steven Veen, the chief financial officer,
also will resign, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Aura's offices were closed Monday, and none of the officers could
be reached for comment. An SEC spokesman declined to talk about the
case.</TE>
<TE>   However, Aura said in its filing that Kurtzman, Veen and Papazian
are accused of "violations of the anti-fraud and books and records
provisions of the securities laws."</TE>
<TE>   The executives "have agreed to propose to settle with the SEC
without admitting or denying" any allegations "to avoid potential
lengthy and costly litigation," Aura said. The allegations grew out
of an investigation into the company's financial statements for the
fiscal years 1996 through 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Aura said that the SEC would seek to bar the three executives from
serving as officers and directors of other public companies and that
it wanted to prohibit Veen from practicing accounting before the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Under the separation agreements, the departing officers gave up
rights to multiyear cash severance benefits in exchange for a
one-time grant of stock options exercisable at a price of 55 cents a
share that vest over 18 months from their termination. Aura shares
rose a half cent Monday to close at 44 cents in over-the-counter
trading.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, each of the officers will be paid as consultants to
Aura for one year at 85% of their current compensation. Aura paid
Kurtzman $385,000 in its fiscal year ended Feb. 28.</TE>
<TE>   Aura said it has talked about a settlement of SEC charges against
the company but that "no agreements have yet been reached."</TE>
<TE>   "Although Aura believes that it will reach a settlement in a
manner that will not have a material adverse effect on the company's
business, it cannot predict with certainty when or if such a
settlement will occur or what the actual effects of such a settlement
would be," Aura said.</TE>

<HD>Reprieve for Disney's ABC Family</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge issues a temporary restraining order to stop
satellite-TV provider EchoStar from dropping the channel.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge Monday granted Walt Disney Co. a temporary
restraining order to block satellite-TV provider EchoStar
Communications Corp. from dropping Disney's ABC Family channel.</LD>
<LD>   The decision came as EchoStar, the nation's second-largest
satellite firm, threatened to stop broadcasting the channel at
midnight Monday to its 6.5 million subscribers.</LD>
<LD>   The order grants Disney a reprieve until Jan. 10, when the court
will review Disney's request for an injunction to block EchoStar's
move. The dispute stems from a contract battle over the former Fox
Family channel that analysts say highlights the challenge Disney
faces in seeking rate hikes from cable and satellite-TV operators for
ESPN and other channels.</LD>
<TE>   "We think it's important to keep the channel alive. But it's not
permanent," said Disney President Bob Iger. "We still face a battle
of sorts unless they are interested in sitting down and negotiating."</TE>
<TE>   Disney filed a lawsuit in mid-December seeking to enjoin EchoStar
from dropping the ABC Family Channel, which Disney bought in November
as part of a $5.2-billion deal with News Corp.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar said that a clause in its contract allows it to drop the
channel when there is a major change of ownership. It also cited weak
ratings at ABC Family and the need to make room for additional
channels because of new federal rules that require satellite
providers to carry all local broadcast channels in their markets.</TE>
<TE>   But Disney contends EchoStar was using the threat as a negotiating
ploy to lower fees and had no justification for quitting the 10-year
contract, set to expire in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Gary Feess of the U.S. District Court of Los Angeles said
"the balance of the hardships weighs heavily in [Disney's favor]
because ... of the harm ABC Family is likely to face should
[EchoStar] cease its distribution."</TE>
<TE>   Disney executives had a mixed reaction to the news, noting that
EchoStar was still planning to drop Disney's ESPN Classic channel at
midnight on Monday. EchoStar delivered the sports channel to about 4
million customers, but sources said the satellite company objected to
Disney's proposed rate hikes for ESPN Classic.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's a shame, but there's nothing we can do about it
from a legal standpoint," Iger said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for EchoStar said the company believes it has the
right to drop ABC Family.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar also is trying to win government approval for a takeover
of its larger satellite rival, Hughes Electronics Corp. which owns
DirecTV.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar has claimed in court filings that Disney threatened to
lobby against the deal if EchoStar failed to carry ABC Family.</TE>
<TE>   Iger said Disney has not yet decided whether to fight the merger.
"One can only wonder how [EchoStar] would behave if they get even
larger."</TE>
<TE>   ABC Family shows a mix of children and family shows and some
Christian programming, which dates to when televangelist Pat
Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network owned the channel.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar's action triggered an angry response from Robertson,
whose talk show, "The 700 Club," is still broadcast on ABC Family.</TE>
<TE>   "I know how important the merger with DirecTV is to you,"
Robertson wrote in a letter to EchoStar Chairman Charles Ergen. "Is
beating up on a channel that features religious programs worth the
potential loss of the deal of your lifetime?"</TE>
<TE>   Disney's stock fell 23 cents Monday to close at $20.72 on the New
York Stock Exchange, while shares of EchoStar rose 17 cents to $27.47
on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Game Sales Poised to Hit Record</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Launch of new consoles sends revenues
soaring in 2001. Industry is expected to surpass $10 billion this
year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The launch of new consoles in 2001 positioned the U.S. video game
industry to hit a record $9billion in sales, but game publishers and
analysts expect this year and next to be even better.</LD>
<LD>   As production constraints ease, Nintendo Co.'s GameCube and
Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox machines should be available in greater
numbers, which in turn should fuel the sale of more software. Some
project the U.S. games industry to surpass $10billion in 2002--and
widen its lead over box office receipts.</LD>
<LD>   "2001 is not the year to get excited about," said Bobby Kotick,
chief executive of Activision Inc. in Santa Monica. "The blockbuster
years are going to be 2002 and 2003."</LD>
<TE>   That growth is expected to bolster Southern California's growing
importance in the video game industry, which relies on the region's
entertainment expertise to develop more interesting and lifelike
experiences for more powerful machines.</TE>
<TE>   Already, video game industry revenues surpass movie revenues.
Domestic box office receipts are expected to total $8.4billion in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Although the full year's tally is not yet available, game sales
for the first 11 months were $7.5billion, according to NPD Group
Inc., a market research firm in Port Washington, N.Y. The industry
typically makes 20% or more of its sales in December, which would
bring the total to $9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "December looks like it'll be around $2.3 [billion] and $3
billion," said Miguel Iribarren, analyst with Wedbush Morgan
Securities in Los Angeles. "We've been projecting as far back as May
that sales would be $9.6 billion for 2001, and the industry is doing
better than we expected. So I wouldn't even be surprised to see $10
billion."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, sales of games, consoles and peripherals slipped 4% to
$7.9 billion from $8.2 billion in 1999, primarily because many
consumers either put off buying a new console or couldn't get their
hands on Sony Corp.'s PlayStation 2.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, though, a plentiful supply of PlayStation 2s and strong
sales of the Xbox and GameCube, as well as Nintendo's GameBoy Advance
hand-held console, pushed hardware revenues into record territory
despite a weak economy and reluctant spending by holiday shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think this industry was affected at all by the softness
in the economy," Iribarren said. "The year was driven by hard-core
gamers, and those people show up rain or shine."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, 2001 was a banner year for software, including such
titles as "Metal Gear Solid 2," "Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3," "Star Wars
Rogue Squadron II," and "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."
Sales of "Metal Gear" nearly topped $25 million the day the game was
released.</TE>
<TE>   An expected price war among console manufacturers this year
probably will increase the number of boxes in the hands of consumers
and accelerate demand for games, Kotick said. GameCube is priced at
$199, Xbox and PS2 sell for $299 each. Many in the industry predict
Sony will cut the price of the PS2 by as much as $50 before next
holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll happen" this year, said Brian Farrell, chief executive of
THQ Inc., based in Calabasas. "Then you'll see a tremendous upswing
on the software side."</TE>
<TE>   Such bullish expectations helped drive up share prices for the
major industry players last year amid a deteriorating stock market.</TE>
<TE>   Shares in Activision, the nation's second-largest independent
games publisher, nearly tripled last year. Electronic Arts Inc. in
Redwood City, Calif., the country's biggest publisher, saw shares
rise 54% last year, while THQ's shares more than doubled. Shares of
Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. in New York, which released "Max
Payne" and "Grand Theft Auto 3" this year, jumped 49%. Even Acclaim
Entertainment Inc., maker of "Mortal Kombat," pulled back from the
brink, ending the year at $5.30, up from 44 cents on Jan. 2.</TE>
<TE>   "In the late 1990s, there was the perception that everything of
importance was happening on the Internet," Kotick said. "Companies
that sell products on store shelves was old news. This year, a lot of
institutional investors who were blindsided by the Internet all of a
sudden stepped back and saw that this was an industry that's growing
20% annually and making money. Before, we never got the attention
from the Goldman Sachses and the Merrill Lynches that we do today."</TE>
<TE>   Not all companies rode the industry's wave of prosperity. The 3DO
Co. in Redwood City saw its stock slip 14%, and shares of Interplay
Entertainment Corp. in Irvine plunged 80% as both companies struggled
with mounting expenses and a lack of hit releases. Their predicament
points to the likelihood of continued consolidation in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting more difficult for smaller companies to compete,"
Kotick said. "This business continues to require scale. Projects are
getting riskier and more expensive. You'll start to see folks realize
that they have to consolidate even further."</TE>
<TE>   Although much of the attention was focused on console games in
2001, PC games have also grown, albeit less rapidly. From January to
November, sales of PC games grew 7% from the same period a year ago
to more than $1.1 billion, according to Steve Koenig, an NPD analyst.
Koenig said sales of PC games are likely to be between $1.3 billion
and $1.5 billion in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Next year, Koenig expects the spotlight to once again be on
console games. "Games have come full circle since the days of the
Atari, when they started in the living room," Koenig said. "Then the
PC was born, and consoles became the lower-end gaming platform. For
in-depth graphics, you had to have a PC in the early 1990s. Now at
the dawn of this new decade, the graphics capabilities of consoles
have become identical to if not better than the PC, and you're seeing
games come back to the living room."</TE>

<HD>New Fund Preserves Affordable Housing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Southland nonprofit organization has raised a $15-million
private-investment pool to purchase California rental housing at risk
of being removed from federal subsidy programs.</LD>
<LD>   National Housing Development Corp. officials said they believe
their new fund is the first of its kind in the nation to draw on
private dollars to preserve affordable housing that is increasingly
"flipping" to market rates.</LD>
<LD>   The fund promises investors an 8% annual average return. The group
secured $13.5 million from nine financial institutions, which will
receive federal Community Reinvestment Act credit for the three- to
five-year investments, NHDC spokesman Bernard Sandalow said. The CRA
requires banks to invest in the low-income communities they serve.</LD>
<TE>   NHDC put in $1.5 million of its own money received from federal
grants and has begun searching for multifamily properties to acquire.</TE>
<TE>   Changes in federal law last year made it easier for landlords to
leave the federal Section 8 program, which provides rent subsidies to
low-income tenants. Other units are being lost as landlords decline
to renew their Section 8 contracts in hopes of getting greater profit
with market-rate rentals.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, owners of multifamily affordable housing who financed
their buildings with tax credits increasingly are prepaying their
mortgages, according to low-income housing advocates, which removes
their obligation to maintain affordable rents.</TE>
<TE>   The result has been an exodus from affordable housing programs at
a time when market rents are prohibitive for many low- and
moderate-income families. The crisis is particularly acute in
California, housing advocates say.</TE>
<TE>   Based in Rancho Cucamonga, NHDC was formed three years ago with
the goal of preserving the nation's affordable housing. Many
portfolios of multifamily affordable housing properties are large and
costly to acquire, having been developed by private owners seeking
economies of scale.</TE>
<TE>   That places them out of reach for many small community-based
nonprofits committed to affordable housing. Private-sector interests,
including real estate investment trusts, also are eager to purchase
blocks of properties and convert them to market rates as their
subsidies expire.</TE>
<TE>   NHDC was designed to compete with those private interests by
financing the acquisition of rental homes and reselling them at cost
to local organizations, the group says.</TE>
<TE>   The housing investment fund is known as CalPool. NHDC is searching
for properties to acquire, which it will renovate if needed and
resell to buyers who pledge to maintain the properties' affordability
in perpetuity, NHDC spokesman Bernard Sandalow said.</TE>
<TE>   Sandalow estimated the $15 million could purchase 500 to 1,000
units, although the cost of subsidized rental units varies across the
state, depending on the condition and size of the buildings and
property values in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, 800,000 to 1 million Section 8 units may lose their
affordability due to expiring subsidies, and about 10% of those are
in California, the largest concentration of at-risk units in any
state, Sandalow said.</TE>
<TE>   Low-income rental units built with federal tax credits also are at
risk. More than 5,000 units in California that received federal
housing tax credits from 1987 to 1989 may be at risk of converting to
market rates beginning in early 2002, according to the San
Francisco-based California Housing Partnership Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "At a time when the affordable housing crisis is so severe and
when it is increasingly difficult to build new projects, California
cannot afford to lose existing affordable units," the group said.</TE>
<TE>   NHDC, which closed its investment pool several weeks ago, plans to
launch similar pools in other states, said NHDC Executive Director
Jeffrey S. Burum.</TE>
<TE>   Financial institutions participating in the California pool are
Washington Mutual Community Development Inc., IndyMac Bank, Downey
Savings &amp; Loan Assn., United Commercial Bank, PFF Bank &amp; Trust,
Business Bank of California, Northern Trust Co., General Bank and
Bank of the Orient.</TE>

<HD>Sale of ImClone Cancer Drug Blocked by FDA</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: Agency's rejection of application could
lead to slowdown in biotech mergers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of ImClone Systems Inc. fell nearly 16% Monday after
regulators said they would not accept the biotechnology company's
application to sell its eagerly awaited colon cancer drug, Erbitux.</LD>
<LD>   Although the company's chief executive, Sam Waksal, told investors
he doesn't believe ImClone will need to conduct new trials to get
approval, analysts said the likely delay in launching the drug is a
blow.</LD>
<LD>   The New York City-based company had hoped to launch the drug,
projected to be a blockbuster, as early as next May. That could be
pushed back six months or more, and the drug may not hit the market
until the first quarter of 2003, said Scott Brown of Raymond James &amp;
Associates Inc. in a report.</LD>
<TE>   The rejection of ImClone's application by the Food and Drug
Administration comes three months after Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
agreed to pay $1billion for a 20% stake in ImClone to gain access to
Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA's demands of ImClone could cause a slowdown in the flurry
of biotech mergers and acquisitions of the last few weeks, as
potential acquirers, eager for late-stage compounds to fill their
pipelines, take harder looks at the deals.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone's shares fell $8.79, or 15.9%, to $46.46 on Nasdaq.
Bristol-Myers' shares fell 80 cents, or 1.5%, to $51 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Erbitux is one of the most promising drugs to emerge from the
biotech pipeline, analysts say, and although it may be delayed, few
expect it to be rejected. The drug is one of a new class of drugs
designed to block a protein found on the surfaces of many types of
cancer cells.</TE>
<TE>   "The regulatory delay does not have any effect on the core thesis
that Erbitux is a blockbuster drug," said Jason Kantor, an analyst at
J.P. Morgan who has a "buy" recommendation on ImClone's stock.</TE>

<HD>Web Site Links Users to Training and Jobs</HD>
<DH>Labor: Group helps the unemployed and low-wage workers
interested in metal, food, and apparel industries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles County economic development group has launched a Web
site to link job seekers, educational programs and businesses in the
metalwork, food preparation and apparel industries.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles County Workforce Preparation and Economic
Development Collaborative serves as a matchmaker, connecting the
unemployed and low-wage workers with better training in industries
that are hiring, and helping businesses in those industries to find a
more skilled worker base.</LD>
<LD>   The Web site, maps.laworkforce.org, uses Internet mapping
technology to help users find training in specific areas such as food
sanitation, welding and pattern making within or near their ZIP Code.
It also provides maps pinpointing the location and concentration of
businesses in those three industries.</LD>
<TE>   The collaborative, which is funded by the state, has conducted
research on those industries to help identify the types of skills
that workers lack and the resources to fill those gaps. With limited
training, job seekers can then take a significant step up the wage
ladder, said Linda Wong, who directs the project.</TE>
<TE>   The site is part of a broader initiative launched by the
collaborative to coordinate a tangle of government, nonprofit and
private-sector resources for everything from job training to
assistance with child care and transportation for low-income workers.</TE>
<TE>   That information is all available on the group's main Web site, la
workforce.org. The idea may seem simple, but it represents a radical
effort to improve communication and coordination in a complex and
notoriously fragmented system.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. County's collaborative is made up of the California Workers
Assistance Program AFL-CIO, the Employment Development Department,
the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, the Los Angeles County
Department of Public Social Services, the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp., the county Department of Education, the Los
Angeles/Orange County Community Colleges Consortium and the region's
Workforce Investment Boards</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of good jobs out there. Don't just wring your
hands and say, 'I'm going to become a security guard or a retail
clerk,'" said Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles County

<HD>Tax Selling Sends Dow Tumbling 115 Points</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major stocks indexes tumbled Monday in an apt coda to the market's
worst year in more than a quarter century.</LD>
<LD>   Investors closed the books on a year marked by economic recession,
shrinking interest rates, dwindling corporate profits, Wall Street
job losses and the Sept. 11 attacks that devastated the heart of New
York's financial district.</LD>
<LD>   "The personal tragedy for so many people on Wall Street makes
everyone happy to put the year behind them," said Rick Meckler,
president of investment firm LibertyView. "You combine that with
what's been weak markets, and I don't think there are many portfolio
managers who will miss 2001."</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, a late wave of year-end tax selling pushed the Dow
Jones industrial average down 115.49 points, or 1.1%, to 10,021.50.
The S&amp;P 500 index lost 12.94 points, or 1.1%, to 1,148.08, while the
Nasdaq composite index dropped 36.86 points, or 1.9%, to 1,950.40.</TE>
<TE>   Although the major indexes were down Monday, winners and losers
finished about even on both Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange.
Trading volume was light as many investors took the day off ahead of
the New Year's holiday. Fewer buyers and sellers made stocks more
susceptible to sharp spikes or declines.</TE>
<TE>   The benchmark Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index ended the year with a
loss of 13%, its worst annual performance since 1974, when it dropped
nearly 30%. The Dow lost 7.1% for the year and Nasdaq lost 21.1%.</TE>
<TE>   The last time all three indexes fell for two consecutive years was
in 1973 and 1974. (The Dow fell in 1977-78, but the other indexes
didn't.)</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts are predicting better times this year. "2002 should
be an up year," Ned Riley, chief investment strategist at State
Street Global Advisors, told Bloomberg News. "We will have more
predictable [corporate earnings] forecasts and growing confidence
that we are not going to fall into a deeper recession."</TE>
<TE>   Riley expects 10% gains for the Dow and S&amp;P 500 this year.</TE>
<TE>   Monday was the last day to sell stocks for any write-offs on 2001
tax bills, so analysts weren't surprised at the market's tone. Much
of the selling was focused in the technology sector. Gateway slipped
30 cents to $8.04, while Microsoft fell $1.62 to $66.25. Nine states
on Monday opposed a Microsoft request for more time to produce
evidence in the antitrust case against the company.</TE>
<TE>   Semiconductor stocks were broadly lower, with the SOX chip stock
index falling 3.1%. PMC-Sierra fell $1.52 to $21.26. It declined 73%
in 2001. Broadcom slid $2.13 to $40.87, and was off 52% for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Database software maker Oracle slipped 25 cents to $13.81. Friday,
after regular trading ended, the company said it would cut between
400 and 800 jobs, mainly in its North American consulting and sales
operations. The stock sank 52% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Some retailers also were weak Monday. Gap fell 7 cents to $13.94,
while Wal-Mart Stores dropped 80 cents to $57.55. Gap slumped 45% in
2001; Wal-Mart was up nearly 9% for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Among Dow stocks, investors took profits in some of the year's
better performers, including IBM, which fell $1.94 to $120.96 but was
up 43% for the year, and Johnson &amp; Johnson, which was off 76 cents to
$59.10 but was up 14% for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, analysts said the U.S. market largely shrugged off news
that Argentina's third president in two weeks had resigned. The
country's serious economic problems prompted the first resignation
barely a week ago; since then two other men have accepted and then
stepped down from the post.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina's market, and many other overseas markets, were closed
on New Year's Eve. Britain's market was open, and the FT-SE 100 index
fell 0.5%. The Mexican market lost 1.5%.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and most foreign markets will be closed today for New Year's
Day.</TE>
<TE>   In other market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Some airline stocks got an early boost after America West
Airlines became the first carrier granted loan guarantees under the
government's $15-billion industry bailout package. Delta Air Lines
rose 74 cents to $29.26 and American Airlines parent AMR gained 30
cents to $22.30. America West rose $1.03 to $3.50.</TE>
<TE>   * Biotechnology company ImClone tumbled $8.79 to $46.46 after the
company said it expects the launch of its experimental colon cancer
treatment, Erbitux, to be delayed until at least the third quarter of
2002 after questions were raised by U.S. regulators over the drug's
clinical data. The drug was to be co-marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb
to patients who had failed to respond to previous chemotherapy
treatments. Bristol-Myers fell 80 cents to $51.</TE>
<TE>   * Gold mining stocks, strong performers in 2001 despite only
modest net gains in the metal's price, rose further. Placer Dome rose
25 cents to $10.91; Glamis Gold added 16 cents to $3.61.</TE>
<TE>   Gold futures ended at $278.70 an ounce in New York, up from
$273.60 a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   * Bond yields fell as investors were lured by 10-year Treasury
note yields that are hovering near four-month highs. The yield on the
10-year T-note fell to 5.02% from Friday's close of 5.11%, while the
yield on the two-year T-note slid to 3.05% from 3.16%.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago the 10-year T-note yield was at 5.11% and the two-year
T-note was at 5.10%.</TE>
<TE>   * The dollar ended in New York at 131.62 yen, up from 131.24
Friday. The yen has tumbled in recent weeks as traders bet the
government wants a weaker currency to help boost Japanese exports.
One dollar bought 114.4 yen a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   * About two hours before the close, floor brokers and traders
gathered on the floor of the NYSE to sing "God Bless America." Mayor
Rudy Giuliani, who was in the final day of his second four-year term
as the mayor of New York City, rang the final closing bell of the
year at the world's biggest exchange.</TE>

<HD>Limited Demand Seen for Commercial Space</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB HOWARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's cooling economy will dampen demand for office and
industrial space during 2002, say commercial real estate forecasters,
who are much more guarded in their outlook for the coming year than
they were as 2001 began.</LD>
<LD>   Investors, developers and commercial real estate brokers expect
demand for commercial space to remain flat or decline slowly for at
least the first half of the year, with recovery coming slowly and
gradually--if it comes at all--in the second half.</LD>
<LD>   Layoffs in the first part of the new year will further reduce the
need for office space, industry observers say, while slowing retail
sales will weaken demand for the warehouses that store consumer
goods. This view contrasts sharply from the prospects just two years
ago, when an accelerating economy was boosting demand for commercial
space.</LD>
<TE>   But the outlook for commercial properties in Southern California
is not all gloomy. Forecasters say the size and underlying strength
of the region's economy, continued immigration of people and
businesses, and the completion of the Alameda Corridor rail
transportation project in Los Angeles County bode well for eventual
recovery in the commercial property markets.</TE>
<TE>   For the time being, however, diminished demand means that
conditions favor office and industrial tenants more than at any time
since the mid-1990s. This is prompting many businesses to renegotiate
leases far ahead of their expiration dates in hopes of locking in
favorable rates--which many landlords will do in return for a
tenant's commitment to stay.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the country's largest commercial real estate brokerages,
Grubb &amp; Ellis and CB Richard Ellis, peg the vacancy rate at slightly
more than 15% for the approximately 170 million square feet of office
space in L.A. County and about 11% for the 60 million square feet in
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Office vacancy rates above 10% are considered a sign of
oversupply, but vacancy rates alone aren't the problem. Substantial
amounts of the empty offices in both counties consist of sublease
space offered at reduced rents by shrinking or stagnant companies
that no longer need all the space they leased.</TE>
<TE>   "When companies start hiring again, they're just going to reoccupy
space that's on the market for sublease, so we won't see a big impact
on demand right away," said Stephen L. Bay, an executive managing
director at Insignia/ESG.</TE>
<TE>   Sublease space is less of a factor in the industrial market, "but
there is still a substantial amount of it that we have to burn
through before we will see growth in demand," said Timur Tecimer,
president of Gardena-based Overton Moore Properties, a developer and
manager of industrial projects.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for office space will be flatter and more stable throughout
Southern California in 2002, observers say, in contrast to the
super-heated demand of 2000 and the decline of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But they say supply and demand are not nearly as out of balance as
they were in the recession of the early 1990s, when rents plummeted
and plunged many landlords into foreclosure.</TE>
<TE>   "For a recession, we are probably as close to equilibrium as you
can get," said John Long, founder of El Segundo-based Highridge
Partners, which develops, invests in and finances commercial
properties.</TE>
<TE>   Generalizing about the Southern California office market is
difficult, said Bay of Insignia/ESG, who added that conditions can
vary considerably from one geographic market to another.</TE>
<TE>   Century City remains a strong market where rents have fallen
little, if at all. Demand remains stable in downtown Los Angeles but
is weak in South Orange County, West Los Angeles and the Conejo
Valley, markets that prospered during the dot-com boom.</TE>
<TE>   "If the tech markets turn around, West L.A. and Santa Monica will
pick up again," Bay said, "but until then, we see what happened in
2001 continuing into 2002."</TE>
<TE>   The South Bay will get a boost because of money being spent on
defense, Bay and Long said, citing Northrop Grumman Corp.'s expected
expansion by at least 200,000 square feet to accommodate its portion
of the Lockheed Martin Corp. contract to build the Joint Strike
Fighter aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, most of the activity in the office market in 2002 will be
renewal negotiations by businesses whose leases are expiring, Bay
said, instead of expansions by companies needing more space.</TE>
<TE>   In the industrial markets, sublease space is just one factor that
will curtail demand for commercial buildings in 2002, said Tecimer of
Overton Moore. Others include continued layoffs, a possible
flattening of consumer spending and a continued decline in capital
spending by corporations.</TE>
<TE>   But Tecimer also cited factors working in favor of an eventual
recovery, including low interest rates, the diverse local economy,
the scheduled completion of the Alameda Corridor this year and low
energy prices.</TE>
<TE>   On a long-term basis, he added, demand for industrial facilities
will outstrip the supply of space that can be developed on the
limited amount of land available for building in central and south
Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   In the near term, however, "The first six months of 2002 are going
to be rocky" for landlords who want to lease large industrial
buildings, Tecimer said.</TE>
<TE>   "Throughout the region," says the Grubb &amp; Ellis forecast, "big
industrial product will be a challenge to lease."</TE>
<TE>   Approximately 20 to 25 buildings of 100,000 square feet or larger
are available for lease in the South Bay, Tecimer said, twice as many
as a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   But demand for large industrial buildings to buy--rather than
lease--remains strong among pension funds and other institutional
investors, and Tecimer said small industrial buildings also are
popular.</TE>
<TE>   "With interest rates so low, entrepreneurs want to buy buildings
in the 20,000- to 60,000-square-foot range," he said. "The demand is
considerably deeper there than it is on the leasing side."</TE>
<TE>   Lower interest rates also have created an opportunity for
investors to profit on the purchase of office buildings by borrowing
cheaply, said Long of Highridge Partners, which recently bought a
400,000-square-foot office building in Dublin, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Such purchases differ markedly from the deals Highridge sought in
the last downturn, when the company bought office property at a steep
discount and amassed a portfolio of neighborhood shopping centers
which it later sold at a substantial profit.</TE>
<TE>   This downturn is much milder than the last one, Long said, so
investors "are just not going to see the extraordinary bargains" of
the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   But when the next recovery begins, Long added, real estate markets
won't have to stage nearly as much of a comeback as they did after
the recession of the early 1990s.</TE>

<HD>Retailers Raise Forecasts on Surge in Holiday Sales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>J.C. Penney Co. and Macy's parent Federated Department Stores Inc.
raised their December same-store sales forecasts, encouraged by a
last-minute holiday rush and crowds of post-Christmas bargain
hunters.</LD>
<LD>   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. left their estimates
unchanged, while Kmart Corp. said sales will decline instead of rise
as much as 2%, as previously forecast.</LD>
<LD>   Retailers--who had slashed prices by as much as 75%--expected a
sales surge just before Christmas. On Dec. 19, almost two-thirds of
consumers hadn't finished buying gifts, and 15% hadn't even begun,
according to the International Mass Retail Assn. The 11th-hour sales
pickup won't rescue the industry from its most disappointing holiday
season in at least 16 years, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   Federated said it now forecasts a decline of 9% to 9.5%, compared
with initial expectations for an 11% to 14% drop. The company, which
also owns Bloomingdale's, Rich's, Lazarus and Burdines, is working
against a 1.2% gain last December. Federated shares rose 39 cents to
$40.90 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   J.C. Penney said December sales at department stores open at least
a year will rise 5% from December 2000, better than the previous
forecast of 3% to 4%. J.C. Penney shares rose 5 cents to $26.90 on
the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Federated and other apparel merchants braced for a bleak holiday
because of the recession and shoppers' lukewarm response to winter
fashions, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. expected industry same-store sales
this month to rise 1% from December 2000. For the combined
November-December period, the bank forecast a 1.5% gain, which would
be the smallest holiday increase since at least 1986. Same-store data
are considered key because they exclude sales at stores that opened
or closed in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart, the largest retailer, said it expects sales growth at
the high end of a 4% to 6% range. On the NYSE, shares of Wal-Mart
fell 80 cents to $57.55.</TE>
<TE>   Sears, which said sales are headed for a percentage decline in the
low- to mid-single digits, fell 36 cents to $47.64. Kmart rose 8
cents to $5.46. Both trade on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Most major chains will report December results on Jan. 10.</TE>

<HD>Rise in Sales Tax Generates Little Uproar</HD>
<DH>Commerce: Quarter-cent hike, mandated by law because of
state budget reserve shortfall, takes effect today but is not
expected to harm sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many California retailers are looking at today's quarter-cent sales
tax hike as a New Year's Day headache. But few were anticipating any
dramatic impact on sales, even for big-ticket items.</LD>
<LD>   State law mandates that when the budget reserve dips below a
certain level, the sales tax automatically inches up at the start of
the next year to help make up the shortfall. Conversely, when the
state is flush with cash, as it was in 2000, the sales tax rate drops
by a quarter cent, which it did Jan. 1, 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The statewide base sales tax rate will rise to 7.25% today, but
the levy is higher in many counties because of special assessments
for transit or other local purposes. In Los Angeles County, the rate
rose from 8% to 8.25%, one of the highest in the state. In Orange,
Riverside and San Bernardino counties the new rate is 7.75%, while in
Ventura County--which has no add-ons--the tax is the base rate of
7.25%.</LD>
<TE>   For everyday items, the change will be almost imperceptible to
many consumers: On a $100 purchase in L.A. County, it means paying
$8.25 in taxes instead of $8.</TE>
<TE>   The pennies add up, though, and the state will gain an estimated
$1.1 billion in revenue, assuming spending patterns remain as state
budget analysts predicted last year. The estimates were not revised
to account for the current economic slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   Even with consumers more cost-conscious, retailers were not overly
anxious about the impact of the tax hike.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's going to affect me," said Roger Vernon, owner
of Vernon Jewelers in Calabasas, who's been in the jewelry business
for 24 years. "People who are buying big-ticket items are still going
to buy them. You're talking about $12.50 on a sale of $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're ready to spend $5,000, $12 is not going to affect
them."</TE>
<TE>   Vernon and other jewelers near the Los Angeles County border were
not worried about losing business to Ventura County, where the rate
is a full percentage point lower.</TE>
<TE>   "If somebody complains, I will pay [the difference myself] instead
of losing the sale," said Krikor Sandjian, owner of Design by
Gregory, a jewelry sales and repair shop in Agoura Hills. "We don't
want to lose any business out of this."</TE>
<TE>   When the tax went down by a quarter point Jan. 1, 2001, Sandjian
said most of his customers barely noticed.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't register that much with them," said Sandjian, who
handles mainly repairs and special orders averaging $300.</TE>
<TE>   Retailers anticipated much the same reaction this time.</TE>
<TE>   Auto dealers needn't worry about customers making a run for the
county border to save money, either. State law mandates that for
cars, boats and airplanes, sales tax is charged based on the county
of residence, not on where the item is purchased. The law was passed
precisely to prevent buyers from crossing county lines to save money
on major purchases.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, for the purchase of some business machinery, sales tax
is based on where the item will be used.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Main, senior vice president of the California Chamber of
Commerce, said the sales tax makes the state less competitive than
other states, such as Nevada, which does not charge an equivalent
sales and use tax on new machinery. A number of states--including
Alaska, Oregon, New Hampshire and Delaware--have no state sales tax.</TE>
<TE>   Even though California offers a credit on most of the tax, Main
said the sales tax increase makes it that much more expensive for
companies to expand here.</TE>
<TE>   "That's been a constant concern for California business owners for
the past several years," Main said. "This just makes it worse."</TE>
<TE>   Some business owners may actually see revenue increase as a result
of the change.</TE>
<TE>   Bud Chapman, president of Cash Register Systems in Santa Ana, said
he's anticipating getting several hundred phone calls the next couple
of days as many merchants scramble to get their cash registers
reprogrammed.</TE>
<TE>   Merchants are liable to the state for the higher tax even if their
machines are still programmed for the old rate. Chapman said his
technicians get an earful from business owners annoyed about having
to reprogram their computerized cash registers.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, phone calls are trickling in, about 30 or 40," said
Chapman, who's been in the business for 28 years. "But wait until
[Jan.] 1 or 2. I'll have to pull technicians off of their routes just
to handle the phones."</TE>
<TE>   Chapman said he can either talk the business owner through the
conversion process over the phone for $25 or send someone out for
$50.</TE>
<TE>   But Chapman doesn't see this as a valuable new revenue stream.</TE>
<TE>   "This is more of an annoyance than it is a moneymaker," Chapman
said. "I'd rather just make our [normal] rounds."</TE>

<LD>The cost of funds index for savings institutions in the 11th Federal
Home Loan Bank District fell to 3.368% in November, lowering monthly
payments on adjustable-rate mortgages in California, Arizona and
Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   The index, called COFI, was at 3.628% in October and fell from
5.617% in December last year as the Federal Reserve cut its key
interest rate 11 times to boost the economy.</LD>
<LD>   The November index sets payments on adjustable-rate mortgages
through January. It measures the interest paid by thrifts in the
district on deposits, advances from the home loan bank and so-called
more costly purchases of short-term funds.</LD>
<TE>   The index is used as a base rate for West Coast mortgages and for
bonds backed by those loans. A decrease lowers monthly mortgage
payments for homeowners and reduces the interest income on bonds
backed by mortgages pegged to the index.</TE>

<LD>Two of Great Plains Energy Inc.'s telecommunications units filed for
bankruptcy, the Kansas City-based company said.</LD>

over the last week to $1.096, the Energy Department reported.</LD>
<LD>   The price of regular unleaded gasoline is down 31 cents from a

weeks as fuel demand rose during the holiday driving period.</LD>
<TE>   The national average price for cleaner-burning reformulated
gasoline, sold at about one-third of the stations in cities and
smoggier areas, was up about a penny to $1.097 a gallon.</TE>
<TE>   Though prices on the West Coast declined half a penny, the region

<LD>Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities fell in Monday's
auction.</LD>
<LD>   The Treasury Department sold $14.7 billion in three-month bills at
a discount rate of 1.710%, down from 1.720% last week. An additional
$17.7 billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 1.8%, down
from 1.85%.</LD>
<LD>   Both the three-month and six-month rates were the lowest since
Dec. 10, when the bills sold for 1.675% and 1.765%, respectively.</LD>
<TE>   The new discount rates understate the actual return to
investors--1.740% for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,956.80 and 1.842% for a six-month bill selling for $9,908.50.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year constant-maturity Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, rose to 2.28% last
week from 2.23% the previous week.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Somehow 2001 didn't turn out quite the way Stanley Kubrick and Arthur
C. Clarke had imagined. It was a year when the most talked-about
critic in America was Dave Manning, an imaginary film reviewer
invented by Sony Pictures who gave rave blurbs to a host of duds
released by the studio. It was a year when $2-million-a-picture
actress Winona Ryder got picked up for allegedly shoplifting at Saks
Fifth Avenue and $20-million-a-picture star John Travolta was so cold
that the studio releasing "Swordfish" stuck him in the background of
its ads with the lesser-known supporting players.</LD>
<LD>   It was also a year when starlet Jennifer Lopez insisted that her
dressing rooms be stocked with white muslin and lilies, film crews
had to secure permission to speak to Martin Lawrence on his movie
sets and Ben Stiller took six different credits on his film
"Zoolander." Here's a look back at a few of the year's other strange
moments and dubious achievements:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Eddie Murphy Impersonator of the Year: Just hours after being
convicted of attempted murder this July, Kevin Jerome Pullum escaped
from Los Angeles' Twin Towers jail using a fake identification card
with a picture of Eddie Murphy clipped from a newspaper ad for "Dr.
Doolittle 2."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Do They Make a Thomas Bros. Map for New York?: Introducing
"Serendipity" at its premiere at the Ziegfeld Theater just weeks
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Miramax czar Harvey Weinstein
praised the film as "a movie about New York--and filmed in New York,"
despite the fact that much of the movie was shot in Toronto and one
of its scenes mistakenly located the New York Times building on 42nd
street instead of 43rd street.</TE>
<TE>   P</TE>
<TE>   But Maybe He's Responsible for Tara Reid Dumping Carson Daly: When
the tabloids pointed an accusing finger at George Clooney as the
source of the Julia Roberts-Benjamin Bratt split, Clooney pleaded not
guilty, saying, "I was too busy breaking up Tom and Nicole."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   King for a Day, Take One: "I have a cameo role in the movie
'America's Sweethearts,' opening Friday. That said, it is one of the
funniest comedies to come down the pike in years." Larry King, USA
Today, July 16, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And Now Direct From the Dave Manning School of Mathematics: To
promote the DVD release of "America's Sweethearts," Sony Pictures
took out trade ads proclaiming "$100 Million Box Office Is Sweet!"
even though the film actually only grossed $94 million during its
domestic theatrical run.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We Had an Inkling the Voting Wasn't Unanimous: Although the New
York Film Critics Circle named David Lynch's "Mulholland Dr." as best
film of the year, New York Observer critic Rex Reed called it "the
worst movie I've seen this year, a load of moronic and incoherent
garbage that started out as a rejected TV pilot and predictably ended
up at the New York Film Festival, where pretentious poseurs sit with
their eyes glued to the screen as long as the projector is running.
... Nothing in this interminable swill makes one lick of sense."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Are These Guys Ready for "Celebrity Death Match" or What?: Stung
by director Kevin Smith's charge that the surprise ending of "Planet
of the Apes" was brazenly lifted from one of Smith's "Jay and Silent
Bob" comic books, "Apes" director Tim Burton retorted that "anybody
who knows me knows that I don't read comic books, and I especially
wouldn't read anything that was created by Kevin Smith."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coming Next Summer: Disney's "Darn the Torepedos": In a key scene
in "Pearl Harbor," Alec Baldwin, playing Col. Jimmy Doolittle, tells
his men that if he's shot down during a retaliatory raid on Tokyo, he
plans to "kill as many of those bastards as possible." But in the
version of "Pearl Harbor" Disney released in Japan this year, the
subtitles for the Doolittle remark read: "I myself would choose a
tasty target."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   King for a Day, Take Two: "Put aside that I make a cameo
appearance in the film 'Dave.' Ivan Reitman's latest is one of the
funniest movies to come down the pike in a long time." Larry King,
USA Today, April 26, 1993.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Soon He'll be Saying the Baby Looks an Awful Lot Like George
Clooney: After actress Elizabeth Hurley named Steve Bing as the
father of her child, due in April, the film producer released a
statement disputing her, saying he and Hurley "were not in an
exclusive relationship when she became pregnant."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And Now That You Mentioned It, I'm Not Sure I Directed It Either:
Asked why her movie adaptation of Beverly Donofrio's memoir "Riding
in Cars With Boys" left out so many major parts of the author's life,
director Penny Marshall responded: "What can I say? I didn't write
it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   But That's Not at All Why the Studio Postponed the Movie's Release
for Six Months: Even though "Rollerball" director John McTiernan took
Ain't It Cool News' Harry Knowles to New York in his private jet to
see an early screening of the upcoming MGM action movie, the online
movie critic still panned the film, calling it "amateurish,
nonsensical and a complete embarrassment."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   But, Honey, Don't Throw Away That Costco Card Just Yet: After
being paid $1 million to star in "Legally Blonde," actress Reese
Witherspoon told Time magazine that after the movie opened big, she
told husband Ryan Phillippe, "This might be it. We might finally get
air-conditioning," adding that "there's this whole fallacy that
because you're in the movies, you make a load of money. But you
really don't."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a Matter of Fact, Think of Them as Your Mother-in-Law:
Interviewed by ABC News several weeks after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, actor Richard Gere said he worried about "the terrorists who
are creating such horrible future lives for themselves because of the
negativity of this karma. If you can see the terrorists as a relative
who's dangerously sick and we have to give them medicine, and the
medicine is love and compassion, there's nothing better."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   King for a Day, Take Three : "Even though I appear as myself in
'Crazy People,' you'll have to take my objective view that it's one
of the funniest movies to come down the pike in a long, long time."
Larry King, USA Today, March 19, 1990.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Imagine How Long It Would've Taken Him to Get to the "Pearl
Harbor" Premiere Party: Even though the post-premiere party for "Baby
Boy" was held directly across the street from the theater the film
screened in, it took co-star Snoop Dogg an hour and a half to cross
the street, according to an account of the party in Variety. After
his car failed to start, the hip-hop star and a posse of bodyguards
eventually boarded a tour bus that ferried them across the street to
the after-party.</TE>

<HD>Standout Percussionist Walks a New Beat--L.A.</HD>
<DH>For Pete Escovedo, father of Sheila E. and Peter Michael,
moving from the Bay Area was a family affair. And so is his music.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pete Escovedo didn't waste any time getting down to business Saturday
night. Squeezing a 10-piece ensemble onto the tiny stage at La Ve Lee
in Studio City, he stood behind his timbales and immediately kicked
into high gear with a spirited rendering of "Esta Noche," the tune's
throbbing Latin jazz rhythms driven by the all-Escovedo percussion
section that included son Peter Michael playing drums and daughter
Sheila E. working the congas.</LD>
<LD>   The family-affair aspects of the performance reached into the
packed audience as well, where wife Juanita and daughter Zina
actively cheered the action, shouting support and enthusiasm. Only
son Juan was missing, unavailable for this particular engagement, but
usually a regular member of the fiery Escovedo Latin jazz ensemble.</LD>
<LD>   "This is it," said the great Latin jazz percussionist and
bandleader after the gig. "This is why we made the move from the Bay
Area to Los Angeles--to be closer to our kids. We've always tried to
get together to play as much as possible, but Sheila and Peter
Michael have been living down here for a while. So we figured that,
with three kids, nine grandchildren, three great-grandchildren--and
another one on the way--we really needed to be closer."</LD>
<TE>   It wasn't an easy decision to make, however. Pete and Juanita
Escovedo, married for 45 years, have deep roots in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been there all our lives," he said. "My wife was born
there, and I was brought up close to Oakland. So to get up and move
was an amazing thing for us. We thought about it for quite a while,
and we were a little undecided until I closed my jazz club, Mr. E's.
That was what sealed the deal. 'What do we do now?' I said. And
getting closer to the kids and to the grandkids was the answer."</TE>
<TE>   The "kids," of course, have careers of their own. Sheila E., who
came to fame under Prince's wing, plays regularly at the Conga Room,
where she is a backer. And Peter Michael led the house band for
Martin Short's short-lived talk show.</TE>
<TE>   It's probably not surprising that Escovedo has such an intimate
musical connection to his offspring. Born in Pittsburg in Contra
Costa County in 1935, he had a family band association with his late
brother Coke Escovedo. Surprisingly, however, he did not start out
with the ambition to be a percussionist.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was a kid going to school," he recalled, "my first
instrument was the saxophone, and my main ambition was to become a
jazz musician. I listened at that time to all the guys--Gene Ammons,
Charlie Parker. And that jazz influence just stuck with me."</TE>
<TE>   It stuck with him but became considerably broadened when he hooked
up with a friend from New York City who offered a considerably wider
musical perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "He started telling me about all this Afro-Cuban music, about Tito
Puente, Machito and so forth," said Escovedo. "So I started listening
to them, and then, at a pretty young age, I was fortunate enough to
meet them. I met Tito in 1956 and became friends with him--and Mongo
Santamaria and Willie Bobo and Armando Peraza, who I worked with for
many years. I got to know Cal Tjader, who was active in the Bay Area,
and eventually recorded with him. The point is that people I was
surrounded by in the Latin jazz scene were incredible, overwhelming,
and it was really because of those associations that I realized the
direction I wanted to go."</TE>
<TE>   After working with brother Coke, as well as younger brother Phil,
in the Escovedo Brothers Latin Jazz Sextet--an enormously popular
ensemble around the Bay in the early '60s--Pete and Coke joined
Carlos Santana's band later in the decade. (A younger half-brother,
Alejandro Escovedo, is an Austin-based singer-songwriter.) Touring
with Santana for three years, they performed on the albums
"Moonflower," "Oneness" and "Inner Secrets" (as well as the Santana
hit rendering of Puente's "Oye Como Va").</TE>
<TE>   In the '70s, the two brothers formed the band Azteca, recording a
pair of albums for Columbia (the eponymous first release, followed by
"Pyramid of the Moon"), and created a model that would continue to be
the pattern for Escovedo's later ensembles.</TE>
<TE>   "We were into the rock scene like everybody else was in the '70s,
along with the Latin rock thing," he recalled. "But the guys in the
Azteca band were all jazz musicians--Tom Harrell, Lenny White, a lot
of great players--a Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears kind of thing. And that
sound, with all the horns, stayed with me from then on. People always
told me that if I got a smaller band, I'd work more, but I knew that
if I did I would lose the sound I wanted. And I get such a kick out
of just listening to the horn players. Looking over there and hearing
the brass section take off--it really fires me up."</TE>
<TE>   And it continues to fire up audiences, as evidenced at La Ve Lee.
As the set continued, the rhythmic excitement building, each number
generated more exhortations from the crowd, more interaction between
the musicians and the listeners, many seated at tables placed
directly against the stage area.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously enjoying every minute of it, Escovedo was all smiles.
Tossing drum passages back and forth with daughter Sheila, giving his
powerful horn players--especially saxophonist Justo Almario and
trumpeter Ramon Flores, as well as pianist Joe Rotondi--opportunities
to stretch out, he was the consummate bandleader, fully in charge and
digging every minute of what was happening.</TE>
<TE>   Although he has been in Los Angeles since February, Escovedo spent
most of the summer fulfilling earlier bookings in the Bay Area, with
most of his Southland appearances taking place at outdoor venues
rather than clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "We did the Santa Monica Pier, the Long Beach aquarium, the
Starlight Bowl in Burbank, places like that," he said. "And that was
nice, because I really don't like to do clubs all the time. But when
you play the outdoor gigs it's, you know, one set and you're done and
you're out of there. And at some point there comes a time when you
want to feel the closeness of the people. I like to be able to look
into their eyes, to feel their reaction, to see if they're really
into the music. And that's what happens when you get into it with a
close-knit crowd in a club."</TE>
<TE>   High on the list of plans for Escovedo's Los Angeles future is the
goal of opening his own room--Mr. E's in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "Definitely," he said. "Oh, yeah. That was my plan from way back.
When I opened my clubs in the Bay Area, my thought always was to
create some other jazz rooms--like a Blue Note kind of thing--in
other cities. And I kind of targeted three areas, to keep the one in
the Bay Area, open one in L.A., and hopefully do one in Hawaii. But
now a club in Los Angeles is at the top of the list. And, since we're
living in Valley Glen, I'd like for it to be something on this side
of the hill. I think the Sherman Oaks/Studio City area is ready for a
first-class Latin jazz room."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adjusting to Different Scene in Southland</TE>
<TE>   Escovedo's focus upon the local area near where he has settled is
understandable. Like many who move to Los Angeles from more
centralized cities, he is still adjusting to the wide-open reaches of
the Southland with its diverse but largely separate communities.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Bay Area, everyone is so close-knit and everybody lives so
close together," he said. "There's like a handful of guys that do
almost everything, in and out of different bands, and everybody knows
what everybody's doing. But here, because people tour, they're in the
studio, some people just play clubs, some people just stick with
salsa or something like that, it's a different scene.</TE>
<TE>   "Then there's the fact that everything is so spread out, that
people live so far away from each other. There seem to be a lot of
musicians around the area where I live, and that's good. But in San
Francisco and the Bay Area, everybody's maybe 15, 20 minutes apart.
Here everything is 45 minutes to an hour apart, and that's a big
difference."</TE>
<TE>   But it's an adjustment that Escovedo is making quickly. Now 66, he
confesses to having initially had thoughts of retiring at 65--an idea
that was totally unacceptable to his family.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids won't let me," he said with a laugh. "'You don't want to
retire,' they said, 'You gotta keep playing.' Meanwhile, I'm huffing
and puffing just to keep up with them."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so, but there wasn't any such struggling apparent in a
spectacular Escovedo solo that was one of the highlights of his set
at La Ve Lee. With Sheila E. by his side--urging him deeper into the
rhythm with shouts of "Come on, come on!"--Escovedo displayed the
improvisational imagination that has made him a Latin jazz legend.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, the truth is," he said a bit later, "at this point, I'm not
going to play any faster than I did years ago. But as I look at
everything in my life and how it's going, it really comes down to my
feeling that, as long as you love what you're doing, as long as you
enjoy it, that's what matters.</TE>
<TE>   "So I'm just going to have fun," he concluded, "and continue to do
what I love to do--although I'll be doing it in Los Angeles now. When
the time comes when I can't do it anymore, I'll know that it's time
to stop. But not yet."</TE>

<HD>Wayne Hancock Creates Sounds of the Road</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>

<LD>Touring is a burden for many musicians, but for Wayne Hancock, it's
cause for celebration. "It's the life that I like best ... so give me
my guitar and I'll roam," the hillbilly-swing songwriter sings on
"Man of the Road," one of many songs about highways, driving and
trains that make up most of his most recent CD, "A-Town Blues" (on
Bloodshot Records).</LD>
<LD>   "You can live like a king, man, and stay out here, stay in nice
hotels every night," Hancock says in a phone call from, naturally, a
hotel room. Hancock got used to moving around at an early age, thanks
to his father's frequent job changes. "Since I was a baby, we would
live some place for two or three years, and my dad would get sick of
the people he had to work with or whatever. We'd make these drives
from Texas to Idaho," Hancock recalls.</LD>
<LD>   "After a while when you move so many places, moving becomes an
escape route; it becomes a way out of reality," he adds. Hancock has
embraced the romance of that fantasy just the same, starting with his
1995 debut, "Thunderstorms and Neon Signs," on which he envisions
hopping freight trains, living in hotel rooms and spending nights in
juke joints. The record earned him critical praise and a devoted
following. After a couple of more heavily produced CDs, he's returned
to a less-is-more approach on "A-Town Blues," relying on guitar, bass
and steel guitar.</LD>
<TE>   "I wanted a lot more of the steel guitar and more of that chunk
[bass] sound to get that road jazz sound right," Hancock says. "I
wanted music that would go with my driving." The music is vibrant, as
shimmering steel and chattering electric guitars dance over swinging
bass lines. Hancock sings his heart out on tear-jerkers like "Sands
of Time," frisky shuffles like "Life's Lonesome Road" and his tribute
to 1920s country legend Jimmie Rodgers on "California Blues."</TE>
<TE>   Hancock's musical world seems to begin with Rodgers, peak in the
1940s with Hank Williams' honky-tonk and Bob Wills' western swing,
and end with rockabilly. "My dad was a World War II vet; he was in it
when he was 16 and that was his music. As a kid, that's what I
listened to," says Hancock, 36.</TE>
<TE>   Hancock keeps these old styles fresh with new variations--he
points out that he puts the slapback bass of '50s rockabilly into his
1940s-style tunes--and writing with wry humor and hard-nosed realism.
A recovering alcoholic who's been sober for 10 years, Hancock has
cautionary tales about drinking and driving, including "Double A
Daddy" and the tragic "Miller, Jack and Mad Dog."</TE>
<TE>   "That happens about once a week," Hancock says of the
DUI-equals-DOA tale. "You drink, you drive, you go fast enough, you
can probably spread yourself out pretty far.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to write about reality and maybe put a funny spin on it,"
he says. "I can't sing songs about why you shouldn't drink especially
when I'm playing in a bar."</TE>
<TE>   Hancock's songs also acknowledge the toll his wanderlust takes on
his love life. "In two or three years, they're tired of me being gone
all the time. They want a man who'll be home," he observes. But he
recently rented a two-bedroom house in his sometime home, Austin,
Texas. Spending two weeks out of the month on tour may have kept him
from settling in, but it's a source of amazement to Hancock that he's
put down roots.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any furniture," he says. "I just go in the living
room and say, 'Wow, a house.'"</TE>

<HD>Up to Their Old Tricks? No Way</HD>
<DH>Pop music: Cheap Trick, the veteran band that refuses to
become simply a nostalgia act, is surfacing with new material.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KOT</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five years ago, Rick Nielsen was sitting in his Rockford, Ill.,
living room marveling at Cheap Trick's longevity.</LD>
<LD>   "At our age, our career should have been over a long time ago, and
maybe it was, but nobody bothered to tell us," he was saying from
underneath his ubiquitous baseball cap and shades. "For whatever
reason, though, we still like to try things, still like the hassles
of being a rock band." Nielsen had no idea, but that resolve was
about to be tested in a major way over the next few years, with
everything from bankrupt record labels to damaged vertebrae
bedeviling one of the finest rock bands ever to emerge from the
Midwest. But as the quartet prepared to ring in its 28th year with a
series of concerts--including New Year's Eve at Chicago's Navy Pier
Grand Ballroom--the future once again looks bright, with new music at
long last on the horizon.</LD>
<TE>   But first, there was a litany of disappointments that would have
killed a less resilient band. In 1994, the group released a fine
album, "Woke Up With a Monster," on Warner Bros., only to see the
executives who signed the band, Mo Ostin and Lenny Waronker, booted
in a corporate merger. The most artist-friendly of labels instantly
became a shell of its former self, and Cheap Trick was left homeless.
The band returned with a self-titled studio album in 1996 that was
its strongest since the early '80s, only to see the Red Ant label
declare bankruptcy soon after releasing the disc. "We lost our shirt
on the road promoting a record that wasn't in the stores," is how
drummer Bun E. Carlos sums up the experience.</TE>
<TE>   But Nielsen, Carlos, singer Robin Zander and bassist Tom Petersson
regrouped, pulling their business under the Cheap Trick Unlimited
umbrella, and releasing "Music for Hangovers," a document of the
quartet's legendary four-night stand at Metro in 1998, with liner
notes by Billy Corgan, and the double-CD and DVD "Silver," from their
25th anniversary concert in Rockford in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Cheap Trick's hugely influential studio albums from the
'70s have been reissued, and the band continued to play more than 150
shows a year around the world. The mainstream may have forgotten
about Cheap Trick, but the band remained very much alive on the road,
one of the few classic-rock bands left that had not become simply a
nostalgia act. Cheap Trick continues to go for the throat; no band
makes high-decibel pop packed with Who-like wallop, madcap humor and
subversive wit this consistently.</TE>
<TE>   The grind eventually wore down Carlos, however. Last July, the
drummer took his first summer off since 1976 to have long-overdue
back surgery. "There was a lot of fast songs and certain bass
patterns that I couldn't handle anymore because the nerves in my
bass-drum leg were getting pinched off," he says. Yet the band forged
on, with Nielsen's son Daxx, a drummer in Chicago pop-rockers Harmony
Riley, filling in. Now Carlos is healthy and the band has been
recording new songs for an album due out next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Our last two studio efforts made us kind of gun-shy--we put out
good stuff that nobody heard," Nielsen says. "But we just got the
rights back to 'Woke Up With a Monster' and the Red Ant record, and
we intend to get them back out there, because those records weren't
throwaways. Take a song like 'You Let a Lot of People Down' [from
'Cheap Trick']: It could have been written about lousy ex-managers or
about Robert McNamara--who led a lot of people to their death in
Vietnam. Now hearing the new revelations about the war, with the
release of the LBJ tapes, I think to myself that I wish people
could've heard this song. That's just one. They got away. Now we're
bringing them back."</TE>
<TE>   Carlos is even more encouraged by the songs the band has been
preparing for its new album. Unlike the late '80s, when Cheap Trick
started to spread the songwriting out among outsiders at the behest
of its hit-obsessed record label, the band is once again a
self-contained enterprise, with Nielsen, Zander and Petersson sharing
all the songwriting.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the new songs are even stronger than the ones for the Red
Ant album, because Rick is contributing more this time," Carlos says.
"Since he quit drinking about a year ago, he's been writing a lot
more. The new songs are more adventurous; some we're not sure if
they're 'Cheap Trick songs' or not, but these days we're not feeling
hemmed in anymore." Nielsen says some of the new songs are surfacing
in the set lists, as well as older songs that haven't been performed
in years. Perfection isn't the point when boredom and nostalgia are
the enemies. "If it's a three-minute song," the guitarist says,
"within 2 minutes and 59 seconds I usually get it down."</TE>

<LD>   Mockumentary Targets Microsoft's Bill Gates</LD>
<LD>   A new shock film is set to debut--one in which Microsoft chief
Bill Gates is assassinated in the Rampart district of Los Angeles.
The movie will premiere at the alternative film festival Slamdance in
Park City, Utah, on Jan. 13.</LD>
<TE>   In the mockumentary "Nothing So Strange," the first release from
GMD Studios, Gates is shot dead in Los Angeles on Dec. 2, 1999.
Though an African American is taken into custody and charged with the
crime, skeptical citizens band together to find the truth.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Flemming, coauthor of last year's off-Broadway hit, "Bat
Boy: The Musical," and co-founder of the "alternative, alternative"
Park City Festival Slumdance, is producing and directing the project
which is inspired, he said, by current events.</TE>
<TE>   "I started thinking about the 1963 Kennedy assassination, when no
one suspected the Dallas police," he told The Times. "And about the
1968 assassination of Robert Kennedy, when no one questioned the
LAPD. Because Rampart was already embroiled in scandal, that seemed
like a recipe for serious controversy in any investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Flemming went through a "period of soul-searching," wondering
about targeting Gates--a man who's alive and well.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, he says, he dismissed his reservations, which he felt,
were grounded less in morality than "fear." "This is a scary,
provocative idea," he said, "but that doesn't mean it's wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft is less than pleased about the project, according to BBC
Online: "It's very disappointing that a moviemaker would do something
like this," a company spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Baxter, head of Slamdance, defends his decision to show the
movie--which was made with low-cost digital technology, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Slamdance gets behind the filmmakers, providing a platform for
films that might otherwise not be seen," he said. "We've stood up to
pressure before and won't whimper out when the going gets tough."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Suspected Assassin Cast in Film 'Kandahar'?</TE>
<TE>   "Kandahar," the critically acclaimed film directed by Mohsen
Makhmalbaf, tells the tale of a Canadian-Afghan woman who enters the
Taliban-controlled country to save her suicidal sister. And,
according to Time magazine and the BBC News, there's an equally
gripping story off-camera.</TE>
<TE>   The featured role of the doctor is played by Hassan
Tanti--described on the movie's official Web site as a "Muslim of
African American descent" who traveled from the U.S. in 1979 to fight
alongside Afghans against Russian invaders.</TE>
<TE>   However, according to published reports, he's really David
Belfield, who is under indictment in the U.S. on suspicion of the
murder of a former Iranian diplomat.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980 in Bethesda, Md., Ali Akbar Tabatabai, a rabid critic of
the fundamentalist Ayatollah Khomeini's regime in Iran, was gunned
down outside his home by someone dressed in a letter carrier's
uniform.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very comfortable that the man who appears in this film is
indeed David Belfield," Maryland state attorney for Montgomery County
Doug Gansler told ABC News. "He's an assassin, and he's a terrorist."</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Belfield seemed to admit in an interview with the network
that he was responsible for the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I knew I'd hit him," he said. New York-based Avatar Films,
the movie's domestic distributor, released a statement in which the
director denied knowledge of the actor's past.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always chosen my actors from crowded streets and barren
deserts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I never ask those who act in my films what they have done before,
nor do I follow what they do after I finish shooting my film."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the revelation, it's unlikely that Belfield will be
brought to trial, observers say, because Iran would be reluctant to
hand over someone suspected of committing a killing for the Khomeini
regime.</TE>
<TE>   The film is scheduled to open Jan. 11 in Los Angeles.</TE>

<TE>   Book Burning Sparks Debate in New Mexico</TE>
<TE>   Calling them "a masterpiece of satanic deception, a religious
group burned Harry Potter books Sunday in Alamogordo, N.M.</TE>
<TE>   "These books teach children how they can get into witchcraft and
become a witch, wizard or warlock," said Jack Brock, founder and
pastor of the Christ Community Church.</TE>
<TE>   Across the street was a line of protesters stretched a quarter of
a mile long.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be useless, but we want [the church] to know the community
is not behind them," said Joann Booth, who took her four
grandchildren to the demonstration where one protester dressed as
Adolf Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   A letter to the Alamogordo Daily News inviting the community to
attend the fires sparked debate in the town of 36,000.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, some locals turned out in front of the public library,
holding signs reading "Book burning? Shame on our town."</TE>
<TE>   Not to worry, Brock said. The media attention is actually a
blessing.</TE>
<TE>   "There are those that are doing their best to make us look bad,"
he said. "But, because of this, I've been able to preach the gospel
around the world."</TE>

<TE>   O.J. Finds Hip-Hop Salve for the Soul</TE>
<TE>   O.J. Simpson says hip-hop music helped him deal with life in the
aftermath of his murder trial.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking before an East Hartford, Conn., hip-hop concert he was to
host on Sunday, Simpson said he became a fan after listening to the
music of slain rapper Tupac Shakur.</TE>
<TE>   "He was singing about having these crazy things happening around
him, and I could relate to that," said Simpson, who was acquitted in
a criminal trial in the 1994 deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown
Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson said he was angered by the accusations of lawyers,
so-called experts and the media during the criminal trial.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really bitter. I wanted to scream," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The hip-hop concert was canceled early Monday after only 100
people showed up.</TE>

<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   J.K. Rowling, 36, author of the "Harry Potter" series, married Dr.
Neil Murray, 30, on Wednesday in a private ceremony in Perthshire,
Scotland, her spokesman said Saturday. Her first marriage, to
Portuguese journalist Jorge Arantes, ended in divorce.... A Michigan
judge reduced charges against Marilyn Manson, who is being sued by a
security guard for sexual assault, from felony sexual misconduct--for
which he could have been sent to prison for two years--to misdemeanor
counts of disorderly conduct and assault. Though each of those
carries a fine of $2,000, no jail time is involved.... Native son
Peter Jackson, director of "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of
the Ring," was given the New Zealand Order of Merit on Monday. Fran
Walsh, his partner and co-scriptwriter, was also given the honor....
Neil Simon's "45 Seconds from Broadway," which opened Nov. 11, will
close on Jan. 13 after 73 performances.... Faye Dunaway is set to
produce and star in a movie about the life of opera singer Maria
Callas, the actress announced Saturday at the sixth Capri Festival of
Cinema. Dunaway was there to present the film "Yellow Bird," which
she directed, and to receive a Legend Award. Dunaway, who already
interpreted the opera singer onstage in the play "Master Class," said
she'd like to have Al Pacino play the diva's companion, Aristotle
Onassis.</TE>

<HD>It's Not What It Seems</HD>
<DH>'Orange County' wasn't filmed there, and the famous names
on the credits don't have famous faces, but it does boast an offbeat
script and eclectic cast.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Atop a beautifully generic suburban bluff in the western San Fernando
Valley, director Jake Kasdan is trying to capture Orange County, the
setting--and the title--of his comedy about a high school senior
trying to get into Stanford.</LD>
<LD>   But the sunlight required to shoot a swimming pool scene in the
Southern California dystopia of Mike White's script is fading fast,
and now, even after the 12th take, Kasdan isn't happy. "Tell her,
delicately, to stick to the script," the 26-year-old Kasdan says
after hearing from the script supervisor that actress Schuyler Fisk,
18, is ad-libbing lines.</LD>
<LD>   "I have to [urinate] like a mule!" interrupts actor Jack Black,
31, while wading chest-deep in the shallow end of the pool, clad only
in a pair of worn-looking tighty underwear and a wet, shaggy black
wig. Treading water next to Black is the film's protagonist, played
by Colin Hanks, 23, whose face cocks to the side, registering an
affable concern that reminds one of his actor father, Tom Hanks,
after one of the crew suggests to Black he simply relieve himself in
the pool.</LD>
<TE>   Jointly produced by Paramount and MTV Films and shot, ironically
enough, around Los Angeles County, the movie "Orange County"
represents the highest-profile outing to date for three children of
Hollywood's elite: Joining Hanks are Jake Kasdan, son of director
Lawrence Kasdan, and Fisk, daughter of actress Sissy Spacek and "Days
of Heaven" art director Jack Fisk.</TE>
<TE>   What has brought them together is an offbeat script by Pasadena
native Mike White, 30, writer and star of 2000's indie sensation
"Chuck and Buck," a former writer for the television shows "Dawson's
Creek" and the critically applauded but short-lived "Freaks and
Geeks," on which he met the younger Kasdan. Producer Scott Rudin
decided to move forward with the project "from the momentum of 'Chuck
and Buck,'"according to White, who said he was asked to rewrite the
script to tone down some of its more cynical elements.</TE>
<TE>   "Orange County," which opens Jan. 11, tells the story of Shaun
(Hanks), a senior at the fictional Vista del Mar High School in
Orange County, and his attempts to get into Stanford University, as
much to study under his idol, novelist Marcus Skinner (Kevin Kline),
as to escape what he sees as the callow pop culture, surfer speak and
dysfunctional family life of his birthplace. His girlfriend, played
by Fisk, helps him through a series of wrenching comedic mishaps, as
does his druggie older brother Lance (Black).</TE>
<TE>   Besides Kline, the film includes a bevy of comedy veterans in
supporting roles, including Lily Tomlin as a ditsy college counselor,
Chevy Chase as a high school principal trying to book Britney Spears
as a commencement speaker, John Lithgow and Catherine O'Hara as
Shaun's father and mother, Harold Ramis and Gary Marshall as Stanford
deans and Ben Stiller as a fire inspector. Kasdan said he first read
White's "Orange County" script while directing episodes of "Freaks
and Geeks" and was delighted when Rudin called him to ask if he
wanted to direct it.</TE>
<TE>   "'Freaks and Geeks'" was a painstakingly real treatment of high
school life, so the look was flat," said Kasdan, as he gazed into a
live monitor that showed the California sun glistening brightly and
largely off the water around Hanks, though, in fact, this is an
overcast day. "This ['Orange County'] is a more stylized comedy,
glossier." (The film has been toned down to get a PG-13 rating in
hopes of attracting a younger teenage audience.)</TE>
<TE>   Because Hanks often visited his actress girlfriend Busy Phillips
on the set of "Freaks," the young actor was fresh in his mind, said
Kasdan. Also, they had met once as children. The director had not met
Fisk before, though both she and Hanks were submitted for the movie
by Courtney Kivowitz at Creative Artists Agency, the same firm that
represents Tom Hanks, Sissy Spacek and Lawrence Kasdan.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw a lot, a lot, a lot of people," said the diminutive Kasdan,
as he pulled his "Freaks and Geeks" cap over his eyes. The lucky
genes in the cast of this film happened "by lottery; everyone wanted
to be in this movie, the script is fantastic," said producer Scott
Aversano, 31, of Scott Rudin Productions, one of a handful of
producers who spend each shooting day making sure this young director
is crafting a product the studio will be happy with.</TE>
<TE>   The young Hanks realizes the possible marquee value of his last
name. "It's genetic; I can't do anything about that," said Hanks, who
nevertheless notes, "If I wasn't good, they wouldn't cast me. Who
would cast someone just because of a last name or who they're related
to? That would be stupid."</TE>
<TE>   Though he grew up in Sacramento and now lives in L.A., Hanks spent
his freshman year of college at Chapman University in Orange County.
"When I was there, I wanted to get out," said Hanks. "Looking back,
it was the best place for me, though, because I was not happy. I knew
I must do something to change it. I draw on that for this character."
Hanks said he's not concerned about following in his father's
footsteps.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm concerned about [director] Jake's expectations. I'm concerned
about keeping my job," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At 18, Fisk is the only cast member playing her real age. "I read
it just before Christmas, and so did my agent, manager and mom," said
Fisk, who has her mother's straight red hair and freckles with an
offbeat farm-girl smile. "I've been acting since I was 'teeing,'"said
Fisk, explaining that in her family "teeing" is short for "tiny
totting," meaning that she's been acting since she was a little girl
in plays and movies, though "Orange County" is her biggest role to
date. Fisk's parents and 11-year-old sister, Madison, are daily
visitors to the set, looking on like a proud family at a graduation
ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Fisk is still very much a teenager, going home each night to
e-mail digital photos of the set to her friends back East who went to
college instead of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "Orange County" screenwriter White, 30, is also the offspring of
someone known to consumers of mass media, but from a different corner
of the American cultural pantheon. White is the son of Methodist
evangelical minister Mel White, a former Christian conservative who
used to write speeches and "first person" books for Jerry Falwell,
Billy Graham and Oliver North, among others, before coming out of the
closet and leaving his marriage in 1993 to become a high-profile
advocate for the acceptance of homosexuals in churches.</TE>
<TE>   "I come from a very literary family," said White, who originally
wrote the "Orange County" script three years ago under a contract
with Paramount. White said the story loosely follows his own higher
education exploits. After insisting to his family that he go to
college on the East Coast, because he thought it was more
sophisticated, he landed at Wesleyan University, a prestigious
liberal arts college in Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   "I showed up in the winter time wearing sockless Dockers,"
recalled White. "And everyone was like 'Why would you leave
California to come to this dreary Connecticut town?' I understand
what it's like to be a writer conflicted over where you grew up."</TE>
<TE>   With another of his scripts coming out soon, "The Good Girl," with
Jennifer Aniston, and the pilot for the critically lauded television
show "Pasadena" under his belt, White is riding high these days. He
even has a cameo in "Orange County" as a clueless English teacher. He
prefers writing about teenagers, he explained, because the stories
work from characters' coming of age rather than on plot machinations.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you give the studio the elements they need to pull the
trigger on a movie yet undermine that at the same time?" asked White
rhetorically.</TE>
<TE>   After a rewrite, the script is less a scathing critique and more a
celebration of Southern California, explained White, though he
originally set out to capture "the nightmare that is Orange County"
as opposed to an idealized sunny paradise.</TE>
<TE>   Making issue of the fact that this movie is shooting in Los
Angeles and not Orange County "is splitting hairs," argues White.
"It's not specific to Southern California beach culture. It's about
any place that isn't conducive to high cultural aspirations. This is
a story about someone with literary aspirations trapped in a world
that is not literary ... but is, instead, a world of cheerleaders,
surfers, Britney Spears, Beavis and Butt-head-speak that blankets
this country because of television."</TE>
<TE>   The northern part of Orange County that is in the union shooting
zone doesn't have the look the filmmakers were going for, said line
producer Herb Gains, because it's an older community than south
Orange County. So, for Hanks' character's house, the filmmakers
settled on West Hills, in the San Fernando Valley, to stand in for
the affluent parts of Orange County. Tract homes in a variety of
plans--Cape Cod, Victorian, Santa Fe, Spanish ranch, Tudor--sit
snugly in crevices of the valley hills that have been lopped flat by
developers.</TE>
<TE>   "The Orange County state of mind in this film is blissful
ignorance," said Gains. Caltech is doubling for Stanford, Malibu for
an Orange County beach and a high school in Diamond Bar is the
fictional Vista del Mar High School.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the pool scene, the March wind is blowing on this late
afternoon, and the actors in the water are growing colder. Black's
constant mad gaze is growing madder still with each passing moment.
He is scheduled to begin shooting the Farrelly brothers' movie
"Shallow Hal," with Gwyneth Paltrow, starting the next day, and he
wants to wrap. ("Shallow Hal" ended up being released two months
before "Orange County.")</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Aversano, a former Ivy Leaguer prone to barking out
things like "Something different than that pantaloon statement," when
describing what he wants from this teen comedy, is talking with
someone from Paramount on the phone:</TE>
<TE>   "We had Lily Tomlin in here yesterday," he said. "She was making
my grandmother laugh 20 years ago. It's hard to argue with that kind
of comedy cachet."</TE>
<TE>   Anxious over the then-looming writers' and actors' strike last
spring, Rudin oversaw the shooting of "Orange County" from afar,
while producing four other movies, including "Zoolander" and the
upcoming "The Hours," with Nicole Kidman.</TE>
<TE>   "I can get you there in three hours!" says Black, delivering a
line of dialogue to Hanks as the camera rolls. But Kasdan still feels
the scene is missing something. He's starting to think he may have to
find a way to quickly dry off Hanks and his clothes and hair and ask
him to jump in the pool again.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, a wrinkled, bronze-skinned guy with a pencil-thin blond
mustache, knee-length surf pants and wild eyes approaches Kasdan and
hands him a film canister. He's Uri Furant, a daredevil documentarist
who has three hours of stock surf footage he shot in Hawaii during a
recent tropical storm. The images will be used in "Orange County" for
a pivotal surfing scene early in the movie.</TE>
<TE>   As Kasdan again tries to turn his attention to the pool scenario,
the shrill whine of a tiny engine takes up a little more precious
daylight on the final shooting day the director has with both this
house and actor Black and without rain, which has been a constant
shooting obstacle. In the near distance, a production assistant
chases a mischievous neighborhood kid across a public playground to
ask him for the third time to please stop riding his motor scooter so
close to the set.</TE>
<TE>   Noted a somewhat stressed Kasdan: "There's a logistical pressure
to get it right. [This is] a high-pressure gig."</TE>

<HD>Mandy Patinkin, Toned Down and Affable</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES THEATER WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mandy Patinkin isn't always manic.</LD>
<LD>   He has a reputation for taking his body English over the top in
his solo concerts. But at the first of two performances, on Sunday
and Monday, at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, his gestures didn't
seem as big as they had when I last saw him five years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Only once did I detect a semblance of Richard III-like contortions
in his stance. By contrast, there were a number of moments when he
simply stood still and sang.</LD>
<TE>   These tended to be the highlights of the show--when his compelling
high tones floated through intricate lyrics, more often than not by
Stephen Sondheim, in a blessedly unforced delivery that made every
word and sentiment clear.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, some of these songs were then overly inflated at
their climaxes, not so much by Patinkin's gestures as by his
microphone, which remained about 2 inches from his mouth.</TE>
<TE>   It was one of those microphones, attached to a headset, that
visibly protrudes into view, in the style of rock stars and telephone
receptionists, as opposed to the less apparent head mikes normally
used in musical theater.</TE>
<TE>   The mike's proximity to Patinkin's throat, coupled with the
apparent absence of anyone modulating the sound during the
performance, meant that whenever Patinkin got excited and loud--which
was fairly often, even if his gestures were toned down--the sound
quality disintegrated to a harsh screech. This was at its worst at
the end of his brief re-creation of his role in the U.S. premiere of
"Evita," which was held at the Chandler in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, the Chandler is a big hall, normally used for opera.
Although Patinkin has an alluring voice, with a hefty lower range as
well as his famous upper register, he hasn't been trained to project
for an opera house. So he needs some amplification. But he and sound
designer Otts Munderloh should reconsider what form that
amplification should take.</TE>
<TE>   Patinkin's tour is connected to the release of his album
"Kidults," but he sang only seven of that album's 16 cuts, instead
choosing to bring back some of the material from earlier albums and
concerts. He opened with a Sondheim rarity, "If You Can Find Me, I'm
Here" from "Evening Primrose."</TE>
<TE>   Of the "Kidults" material, some of the novelty numbers work better
in concert than on the recording, for Patinkin adds visual
components--in the form of a hand puppet in his rendition of "Holiday
for Strings" and his own Bert Lahr impression as the Cowardly Lion in
a "Wizard of Oz" number. It also helps to be able to see him act some
of the roles in his smart blending of "Everybody Says Don't" and "The
King's New Clothes."</TE>
<TE>   Presented under Center Theatre Group auspices, he
cross-promoted--inadvertently or not--a couple of CTG's other shows.
He sang "You Are Beautiful" from "Flower Drum Song," which is next
door at the Mark Taper Forum, and he sang excerpts from "Into the
Woods," coming soon to the Ahmanson Theatre two doors away.</TE>
<TE>   He was accompanied, as usual, by Paul Ford at a simple upright
piano. Again, as customary for Patinkin, the stage was bare except
for a couple of bouquets and some lighting fixtures arranged with a
studied casualness. In combination with the microphone, the staging
almost looked like an attempt to suggest a recording session.</TE>
<TE>   However, recording sessions usually don't have audiences, and
Patinkin was keenly aware of the people out there in the dark.</TE>
<TE>   Without singling out individuals, he got the audience to do the
hokey-pokey as he sang the song in Yiddish, and he enlisted the
audience as the chorus when he warned River City of the dangers of
pool, from "The Music Man."</TE>
<TE>   He talked about his wife's Sherman Oaks roots and about the way
his sons inspired his heartfelt rendition of Harry Chapin's "Cat's in
the Cradle."</TE>
<TE>   He told a long story about how he selected his outfit for this
tour--a maroon collarless shirt, black pants, and New Balance
sneakers. The story wasn't quite as funny as it was long. It might
have been funnier with a slide that showed us his first and reputedly
disastrous choice of apparel.</TE>
<TE>   At one point during the Sunday performance a car horn began
blaring--from somewhere in the Music Center garage? It was surprising
to hear such an intrusive sound leak at the Music Center, but
Patinkin handled it with aplomb. He projects such an affable and
temperate personality these days that his signature mannerisms may
soon become simply the subject of parodies past.</TE>

<HD>Dramatic Look at Realities of Childbirth Around the World</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Myth would have it that Baby New Year crawls onto the scene today:
cute, carefree and adorned with a "Happy 2002" banner. And then
there's the reality of childbirth: painful, bloody and often
dangerous.</LD>
<LD>   "World Birth Day" (9 tonight, TLC) takes an unflinching look at
the latter, through the experiences of 11 women in nine countries on
one July day last year.</LD>
<LD>   Although its goals are noble--to celebrate childbirth and to teach
about the varying conditions and cultures in which babies are
born--the documentary provides so much clinical detail that it will
no doubt drive many squeamish viewers away.</LD>
<TE>   That's a shame, because the story behind each birth contains drama
and yields insight into societies ranging from Communist China to
India to Germany. Here is just one tale:</TE>
<TE>   In Nazareth, Ethiopia, the filmmakers follow Gize, a young woman
expecting her first child with her husband, Meles, who is away on
military duty. Most Ethiopian women, narrator Matthew Modine says, go
to the hospital to give birth only if there's a complication, and
such is the case with Gize. She can't push the baby out by herself.</TE>
<TE>   At the hospital, two babies have already died that night, and a
third was stillborn.</TE>
<TE>   Though Gize delivers a healthy boy, she suffers bleeding that
temporarily endangers her life.</TE>
<TE>   When she finally goes home to her mud house, Gize and son will
spend 40 days in bed behind curtains and shuttered windows in
accordance with tradition and a belief that outside air is harmful.</TE>
<TE>   If stories such as this sound fascinating, though, be forewarned.
These two hours will be difficult viewing for anyone who squirms at
the sight of women in states of undress writhing in agony,
injections, blood, close-up shots of vaginal births and C-sections or
a stillborn child.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the fathers themselves found it tough, and the film spares
few opportunities to make fun of them for their squeamishness. It
seems more than a bit unfair, especially after we learn that one San
Francisco couple, both father and mother, dropped out of Lamaze class
because they couldn't take watching the videos.</TE>

<HD>Security Fee for Air Travel to Start Feb. 1</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Air travelers will begin paying a security fee of as much as $10 a
trip in February to help pay for increased baggage and passenger
screening, the Department of Transportation said.</LD>
<LD>   The fee applies to tickets sold on or after Feb. 1 and is $2.50
per flight boarded, with a $5 maximum for one-way travel and $10 for
a round trip. The charges, set in a November law, apply to domestic
and overseas flights originating at U.S. airports.</LD>
<LD>   The DOT said it expects to collect about $900 million this fiscal
year, which runs through September.</LD>
<TE>   The department's new Transportation Security Administration was
required to write rules for collecting the fees, which were set as
part of an air-security bill signed by President Bush on Nov. 19.</TE>
<TE>   The law replaces a system under which airlines arranged and paid
for airport security. The law also requires additional baggage
inspections starting next month and the hiring and training of 28,000
security screeners within a year.</TE>
<TE>   Frequent fliers traveling on free tickets also will have to pay
the fee, the DOT said.</TE>

<HD>Largest Donations Smaller in 2001</HD>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>There must be a recession--even Bill Gates is cutting back.</LD>
<LD>   And he's not alone. The super-rich are becoming much more frugal
with their charitable giving.</LD>
<LD>   The 10 largest single gifts to charity in 2001 totaled $4.6
billion, down nearly 60% from $11.08 billion the previous year.</LD>
<TE>   Gates, the chairman of Microsoft Corp., retained the top spot on
the list of large individual gifts compiled by the Chronicle of
Philanthropy. But last year the world's richest man gave $2 billion
to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation after donating $5 billion in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Last year was "just not as healthy a year, but that isn't
surprising given the state of the economy," said Stacy Palmer, the
Chronicle's editor.</TE>
<TE>   The decline in the size of donations by the wealthy comes as
average Americans opened their wallets with extraordinary generosity
to help Sept. 11 victims.</TE>
<TE>   "The kind of gifts given by the wealthy are dependent on the
economy. It isn't the same as someone giving $20 to $30 for a cause,
but the timing is ironic," Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   The Chronicle compiles its lists from public announcements made
through the year.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Moore, co-founder and chairman emeritus of Intel Corp., and
his wife, Betty, are the only other individuals who also were on the
top-10 list for 2000, and their donation also dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Their $300-million pledge to Caltech for science and education
programs was the third-largest on the 2001 list. In 2000, their
$5-billion pledge to endow the Gordon E. and Betty I. Moore
Foundation shared top honors with Gates' gift.</TE>
<TE>   The second-largest gift last year was a $1.11-billion pledge by
Jim Stowers and his wife, Virginia, to endow the Stowers Institute
for Medical Research.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the top five were Bill Coleman, founder of BEA
Systems in San Jose, and his wife, Claudia, who pledged $250 million
to create a research institute operated by the University of Colorado
system. The couple tied for fourth with Ted Turner, founder of CNN
and Turner Broadcasting System, whose pledge went to establish a
Nuclear Threat Initiative. The fifth-largest donation was an
anonymous pledge of $230 million for unrestricted use at the
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.</TE>

<HD>Mexican Congress Passes New Taxes in Fiscal Reform</HD>
<DH>Latin America: The measures fall far short of president's
plan, which critics say would target the poor unfairly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL ANGEL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Mexico's Congress passed a $7.5-billion package of new taxes Monday,
including new levies on telephone services, soft drinks and
cigarettes, meant to boost government income and ease dependence on
oil exports.</LD>
<LD>   The taxes were drawn up following months of debate by the nation's
main political parties after they rejected key elements of President
Vicente Fox's fiscal reform package presented in April.</LD>
<LD>   New revenues from the tax reforms were estimated at $7.5 billion,
far from the government's original goal of raising $13 billion.</LD>
<TE>   The taxes won broad support in the lower house, the Chamber of
Deputies, despite opposition from industry leaders. The Senate
narrowly approved the tax package in general terms, with 56 votes for
and 55 against, though it still was debating some details.</TE>
<TE>   Tax reform is the last hurdle Mexico faces in convincing Standard
&amp; Poor's Corp. to raise Mexico's credit rating to investment grade, a
move that would lower its borrowing costs substantially.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it was not clear whether the approved reforms--which would
raise much less than the government had initially sought--would
sufficiently strengthen government finances to win that rating
upgrade.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies already had agreed over the weekend to cut private-sector
tax breaks and to create a tax on some stock market transactions.</TE>
<TE>   But the Senate sent that tax back to the lower house seeking some
changes. It was not clear on Monday what final form it would take.</TE>
<TE>   The reform package was radically different from that proposed in
April by Fox's government, which took office 13 months ago. It also
will raise much less money than Fox had requested.</TE>
<TE>   His plan centered on extending the 15% value-added tax to food and
medicines, but it was met with hostility in the opposition-dominated
Congress, with critics saying Mexico's 40 million poor would bear the
brunt of the reform.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's own conservative National Action Party quickly made clear it
would not try to force the VAT measure through, and opposition
parties rejected compromise proposals under which a lower VAT rate
would be applied to food and medicines.</TE>
<TE>   The reforms approved Monday were more populist in tone.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Economy Ready  to Rebound, Report Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Big Apple's economy is ready to rise in 2002 following fallout
from the Sept. 11 World Trade Center attacks, according to a survey
of New York City executives released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   There were encouraging signs that New York's economy is poised for
recovery. Although more people probably will lose their jobs in the
coming months, the rate of layoffs has slowed. Tourists who were
scared away by the attacks that killed an estimated 3,000 people have
begun visiting the city once more. And the residential real estate
price skid has ebbed, the report said.</LD>
<LD>   The National Assn. of Purchasing Management-New York said its
business conditions index rose to 252.3 in December from November's
246.2, snapping its streak of five monthly declines.</LD>
<TE>   The index regained nearly one-third of its October-November loss,
leaving the index 9.8% below its all-time high of 279.8 in November
2000.</TE>
<TE>   All four components of the index jumped sharply in December, each
ending the year above 50, suggesting the New York City economy may be
poised to grow in the new year after contracting in the second half
of 2001.  All four components had been below 50 in November. A number
above 50 shows expansion, below 50 shows contraction.</TE>

<HD>Taiwan Enters WTO After Long Quest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taiwan formally joins the World Trade Organization today after a
decade-long bid to enter the global trading club, raising hopes for
better ties with its giant neighbor China.</LD>
<LD>   Although Taiwan, the world's 14th-largest trading economy, has
fought for admission since 1990, it will bring mixed blessings to the
island of 23 million people.</LD>
<LD>   WTO membership will mean mostly cheaper prices for consumers, but
it is certain to hurt agriculture and labor-intensive industries and
cause already record-high unemployment levels to rise even further.</LD>
<TE>   Taiwan's "Asian Tiger" economy is set to post its first full-year
contraction this year, and competition from powerful multinational
firms will bring tough challenges to local companies.</TE>
<TE>   But Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang said any initial shock would
be a price worth paying.</TE>
<TE>   "Under pressure from mainland China, we are unable to join the
political United Nations," Yen told a forum on Taiwan's WTO
accession. "Joining the economic United Nations, the WTO, is
definitely positive for raising our international status."</TE>
<TE>   Officials have held out hopes that the dual entry of Taiwan and
China to the world trade body would usher in a year of reconciliation
and help ease bitter political differences.</TE>

<HD>Treasury Admits Auction Error</HD>
<DH>Securities: The department says because of a clerical
mishap, $4.35 billion more in short-term bills were sold than
reported.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As clerical errors go, it may go down as one of the biggest in the
annals of government bookkeeping: the U.S. Treasury said it sold
$4.35 billion more in short-term bills Monday than it originally had
thought.</LD>
<LD>   The Treasury Department's Bureau of Public Debt said it made a
rare "clerical error" in its usually routine auctions of short-term
Treasury bills--it understated bids for its 13-week and 26-week
securities by $1.70 billion and $2.65 billion, respectively.</LD>
<LD>   That meant that instead of selling $28 billion in Treasury bills,
as originally believed, Treasury actually sold $32.35 billion.
Investors had offered a total of $63.25 billion for the bills.</LD>
<TE>   Treasury gave no further comment on the problem, describing it
only as a clerical error. Treasury said the rates at which the bills
were sold--the component most closely watched by Wall Street debt
traders--were not affected by the mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Though $4.35 billion is hardly spare change, the fact the error
was not uncovered until later in the day underscores the sheer size
of the U.S. Treasury market.</TE>
<TE>   The Monday afternoon auctions of three- and six-month bills are
often eagerly awaited by Wall Street to help give direction in
trading of U.S. debt securities. Investors submit bids to the
Treasury, usually through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, by 1
p.m. Eastern time. Treasury then accepts or rejects the individual
bids, depending upon whether they fall above or below the rate needed
to sell a predetermined amount of securities.</TE>
<TE>   On a slow day, a weak auction can further deflate the market,
while on a busy day the auctions may go largely unnoticed. Because of
their importance to the financial markets, auction results have in
the past been amended only on an extremely rare basis.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the bill auction took place in the morning, due to the
U.S. bond market's early close for the New Year holiday. Also, in
recent months, the Treasury has tried to speed up the results
process, narrowing the gap between when the bids are tabulated and
when the results are released. It is unknown, however, if either of
those factors played a part in Monday's mistake in reporting some
bids.</TE>
<TE>   Interest rates on short-term bills fell in Monday's auction.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury Department sold $14.7 billion in three-month bills at
a discount rate of 1.710%, down from 1.720% last week. An additional
$17.7 billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 1.800%, down
from 1.850%.</TE>
<TE>   Both the three-month and six-month rates were the lowest since
Dec. 10, when the bills sold for 1.675% and 1.765%, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   The new discount rates understate the actual return to
investors--1.740% for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,956.80 and 1.842% for a six-month bill selling for $9,908.50.</TE>

<HD>Apartment Market to Soften</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Apartment markets will "soften moderately" in Los Angeles and Orange
counties during 2002, continuing trends that began in 2001, according
to a new forecast.</LD>
<LD>   In Los Angeles County, rent growth will slow to 3%, compared with
5% in 2001, said the report by Marcus &amp; Millichap. The county's
vacancy rate is expected to increase to 4.3% by the end of the year,
up from 4%.</LD>
<LD>   "Many landlords, especially in Central L.A. and the South Bay, are
finding themselves in the peculiar position of having to evict
tenants who are no longer able to pay their rent," the forecast said.
Many travel and hospitality industry workers who lost their jobs
after Sept. 11 no longer can afford their apartments.</LD>
<TE>   In Orange County, vacancies are projected to peak at 4.5% by
mid-year, up from 4% in 2001, and begin recovering in the second
half. Rents are expected to grow by 2%.</TE>
<TE>   Both Marcus &amp; Millichap and Los Angeles-based PCS Development see
good long-term prospects for the Southern California apartment market
despite the current softening.</TE>
<TE>   "The inherent imbalance between supply and demand will remain,"
said the PCS outlook, which noted that the company is proceeding with
construction of 148 units in Thousand Oaks, 221 units in Long Beach
and 35 units in Beverly Hills.</TE>

<DH>Stocks: U.S. Steel returns as a stand-alone company as
several firms, after mergers and spinoffs, unveil new identities.</DH>

<LD>Mergers, spinoffs and name changes as the new year arrives--including
the return of U.S. Steel as a separate company--again will affect
stock listings.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Steel, one of America's economic stalwarts in the mid-20th
century, will come back as a stand-alone entity as a result of a
tax-free spinoff from USX Corp.</LD>
<LD>   USX, which comprised Pittsburgh-based USX-U.S. Steel Group and
USX-Marathon Group of Houston, will change its name to Marathon Oil
Corp.</LD>
<TE>   The New York Stock Exchange tickers will remain X and MRO,
respectively, and they will appear in Associated Press composite
stock tables as USSteel and Marathon.</TE>
<TE>   Other changes include:</TE>
<TE>   * Shamrock Logistics LP, (ticker symbol: UDL) a San Antonio-based
transporter of refined products, will change its name to Valero LP

<TE>   Citigroup Takes Crown</TE>
<TE>   in Wall St. Underwriting</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup Inc. became Wall Street's largest underwriter of stocks
and bonds in 2001, ending Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s 11-year run at the
top, Thomson Financial Securities Data said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit arranged $486.9 billion of
securities sales, capturing 12% of a $4.08 trillion market. Merrill
Lynch placed second, with $432.7 billion of sales and a 10.6% market
share.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon, which will adopt the Citigroup name next quarter, has won
more underwriting assignments by bundling them with less profitable
services such as credit lines, analysts said. Citigroup was formed in
1998 when bank holding company Citicorp merged with insurance giant
Travelers Group to give consumers a one-stop "supermarket" for a
variety of financial services.</TE>
<TE>   Credit Suisse First Boston, a unit of Credit Suisse Group, was
third with $346.9 billion of sales.</TE>
<TE>   The investment banks set records despite seeing business grind to
a halt for much of September, following the attacks of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Though underwriting of new stock issues declined, Wall Street did
huge business in 2001 helping companies borrow via bond offerings.
Many companies issued new bonds at lower yields, to refinance older,
higher-cost debt.</TE>
<TE>   Issuance of investment-grade and convertible debt soared to $638.5
billion and $103.4 billion, respectively. Both were records.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MENLO PARK</DL>
<LD>Jean-Louis Gassee, a former Apple executive, is leaving Be Inc. as it
winds down operations, the company announced Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Gassee, president and chief executive of Be, founded the small
company in 1990 after more than nine years at Apple Computer. Be made
an operating system for Internet appliances and PCs.</LD>
<LD>   Palm Inc. announced in August that it was buying the Menlo
Park-based company's technology assets for $11 million. Since those
assets were transferred, Be has been dissolving the remainder of the
business.</LD>
<TE>   Be's board of directors appointed Dan Johnston, Be's general
counsel, to serve as president as the dissolution is completed.</TE>
<TE>   While at Apple, Gassee started the company's French subsidiary,
Apple's largest business unit outside of the United States. He also
served in management at Hewlett-Packard and Data General, and is a
director for 3Com, Electronics for Imaging and Logitech.</TE>

<HD>EMachines Founder Buys Shares</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James S. Granelli</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A founding director of EMachines Inc. said Monday that he has
acquired all the remaining shares of the Irvine low-cost personal
computer maker at $1.06 a share in a $159-million cash buyout.</LD>
<LD>   The director, Lap Shun "John" Hui of Garden Grove, used one of his
companies, EM Holdings Inc., to complete the transaction. Hui had
owned nearly 1.3% of EMachines. The purchase price values EMachines,
the nation's third-largest vendor of desktop PCs in stores, at about
$161 million.</LD>
<LD>   EMachines has lost $295 million since early 1998, but executives
have said they expect a revamped company to break even or post a
slight profit for the final three months of the year.</LD>
<TE>   EM Holdings released its news after the market closed. EMachines
hit a 52-week high of $1.05 a share during trading and closed at
$1.04, up 4 cents a share in over-the-counter trading. The company's
stock began falling from its March 2000 initial public offering price
of $9 a share and never recovered.</TE>

<HD>Realty Pros to Watch in 2002</HD>
<DH>Though many will focus on filling vacant space, several
innovative developers will pursue intriguing local redevelopment
projects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the midst of an economic decline that dawned with the tech wreck
and was exacerbated by the fallout of Sept. 11, local property
professionals face slowed demand for offices, stores and warehouses.
The focus for many this year will be to fill vacant space and find
tenants for new developments nearing completion.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, several innovative real estate developers will pursue
some of the most intriguing redevelopment projects the Los Angeles
area has seen. A common theme among these: high-density
revitalization of urban sites through "mixed" uses rarely seen here.</LD>
<LD>   Some key factors make such new uses desirable and financially
viable even in the face of a national recession. Among them: Southern
California's continuing population explosion; high home prices and
apartment rents; and congested freeways and thoroughfares.</LD>
<TE>   As the year turns, realty pros also have their collective eye on
some pending high-profile property transactions that should indicate
how the investment community views the local market's near- and
longer-term prospects.</TE>
<TE>   The following are some local commercial real estate figures
expected to make headlines in the months ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Maguire, principal, Maguire Partners, Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Background: One of the region's most prolific and visible
commercial developers, Maguire has been angling to raise capital by
selling a stake in his extensive portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   Why watchable: New Year's apparently passed without a deal, but
one may be coming soon. His reinvestment of the proceeds probably
will make news as well, with some of it presumably helping finance
construction at the Playa Vista planned community near Marina del
Rey.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Provencio, vice president, AEW Capital Management, Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Background: Oversees clients' regional property holdings for
Boston-based investment advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Why watchable: He's the seller's local point man managing the
bidding among numerous high-powered candidates trying to buy a
portfolio of Warner Center high-rise office towers and an adjacent
business park. The price is expected to far exceed $400 million,
making it one of the biggest Southland real estate deals slated for a
2002 close.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Bohlinger, senior vice president, CB Richard Ellis, Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Background: Veteran investment broker heads a team working to sell
downtown L.A. landmark Arco Plaza for owner Shuwa Investments.</TE>
<TE>   Why watchable: While Shuwa's Tom Kibler and brokers at Cushman &amp;
Wakefield continue seeking tenants for Arco Plaza's empty offices,
Bohlinger and company will be working with prospective buyers for the
twin towers.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Silk and Jay Borzi, senior managing directors, Secured
Capital Corp., Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Background: Investment brokers have handled several of the West
Coast's largest commercial property sales in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Why watchable: The assignments seem to keep rolling in, including
large malls, industrial portfolios and high-profile office properties
such as Warner Center, where the brokers work for Provencio.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Stelzl, principal, Colony Capital, Century City.</TE>
<TE>   Background: Identifies and evaluates potential investments for a
firm whose various opportunity funds have acquired and managed
several billion dollars' worth of real estate assets.</TE>
<TE>   Why watchable: Colony is working on its fifth mega-fund, and
Stelzl's team is said to be bidding on the Warner Center portfolio.
The group may not end up with Warner Center--but Stelzl's
participation seems to portend other large local deals.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Tanner, senior vice president, Los Angeles Arena Land Co., Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Background: Development executive with extensive public-private
partnership experience is now the point man on plans for the proposed
$1-billion mixed-use project adjacent to Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Why watchable: Anyone who followed the approval and construction
process at Staples realizes Tanner and company's every move will be
heavily scrutinized--especially when that elusive convention hotel
comes up.</TE>
<TE>   Avi Shemesh, Shaul Kuba and Richard Ressler, principals, CIM
Group, Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   Background: Innovative urban real estate investment and
development group's many successes have continued to attract
capital--and other intriguing projects.</TE>
<TE>   Why watchable: The renovation and reuse specialists' latest
endeavor is the former Southern California Gas Co. headquarters
property just south of downtown L.A.'s high-rise core. CIM's plans
include commercial space, residential lofts and even a supermarket.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Soboroff, president, Playa Vista, Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Background: After his failed bid to replace friend Richard Riordan
as L.A.'s mayor, the retail-chain realty representative and shopping
center owner took over the reins as development point man at the
Westside's huge and controversial planned community.</TE>
<TE>   Why watchable: If it's yet another challenge Soboroff seeks, he's
certainly found it in Playa Vista, which faces many detractors and
slowing commercial tenant demand. No one said the initial Staples
Center development agreement would be easy either, but Soboroff's
energy helped usher it through.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Snyder, principal, J.H. Snyder Co., Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Background: Veteran builder remains one of the most active
income-property developers in town.</TE>
<TE>   Why watchable: Snyder and his partners already had several
innovative mixed-use projects in the works before assuming oversight
of the long-planned $218-million NoHo Commons redevelopment in North
Hollywood, slated to feature apartments, offices and shops.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Siffin, principal, Maefield Development Corp., West
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Background: Transplanted Midwesterner and his partners are nearing
completion of the initial retail phase of a big mixed-use development
billed as a "gateway" to the Sunset Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Why watchable: His ambitious Sunset Millennium is one of the
region's highest-profile redevelopment projects. But as the
hospitality business reels, he's looking to substitute apartments for
Millennium's planned hotel. That shift alone is bound to generate
more headlines.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Samuels, senior vice president, LCOR Public/Private Inc.,
Century City.</TE>
<TE>   Background: National director of retail development with one of
the country's best-known public-private development specialists.</TE>
<TE>   Why watchable: The region hasn't seen a lot of retail developments
that stack giant stores such as Home Depot and Costco on top of one
another--especially in neighborhoods in need of economic
revitalization. But that's just what Samuels' group plans to build,
along with other shops, restaurants and 1,500 parking spaces on the
old Sears site at Pico and Venice boulevards.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Caruso, chief executive, Caruso Affiliated Holdings, Santa
Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Background: Retail specialist has tackled increasingly large and
challenging projects, such as the Grove at Farmers Market in the
Fairfax district of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Why watchable: Caruso has drawn kudos for most of his popular
open-air shopping centers, but the neighborhood jury is still out in
Fairfax. Now he's hooking up with apartment developer Legacy Partners
Residential to create a $100-million mixed-use project in Glendale.
The L.A. Police Commission president also is helping create the
master plan for one of Playa Vista's main districts.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Ricci, senior vice president, Thomas Properties Group, Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Background: Oversees business development and development services
for the active property developer, investor and operator.</TE>
<TE>   Why watchable: He's point man for a Thomas-led group pursuing
approvals to convert 46 vacant El Segundo acres into a major
mixed-use project. Though immediate construction is unlikely in the
current climate, the development could become a linchpin of the
city's ongoing expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Furniss, senior vice president, Lowe Enterprises Commercial
Group, Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Background: Key development executive managing Bob Lowe's
extensive real estate empire.</TE>
<TE>   Why watchable: Oversees a $200-million mix of redevelopment
activities totaling 1.8 million square feet slated for Hawthorne's
104-acre former Northrop Grumman Corp. campus, now dubbed the
Exchange. An AT&amp;T Corp. data center and shopping center anchored by a
home improvement store already are booked.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Ezralow, chief executive, Ezralow Co., Calabasas.</TE>
<TE>   Background: Has taken the successful family real estate firm to
the next level with numerous income-property development projects.</TE>
<TE>   Why watchable: Among various ongoing local ventures is the
mixed-use redevelopment of the 100-acre former NASA campus in Downey
into retail and technology-related uses.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Niemann, senior vice president, Trammell Crow Co., Century
City.</TE>
<TE>   Background: Among other projects, overseeing the planned
redevelopment of Century City's ABC Entertainment Center complex on
behalf of the property's institutional owners.</TE>
<TE>   Why watchable: It's hard to find a higher-profile redevelopment
project than demolishing the ABC Entertainment Center (including the
Shubert Theater) and adjacent plaza in favor of a $280-million plan
featuring a "mid-rise" office building and park. Approvals will
consume the coming months. After that comes the search for tenants.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell Hugh Greenup, executive vice president of development,
Kilroy Realty Corp., Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Background: Oversees development for one of Southern California's
most active office and industrial builders.</TE>
<TE>   Why watchable: With tech still struggling, Greenup is in the hot
seat as Kilroy continues to seek tenants for the Westside Media
Center along the Olympic Corridor--and now for a major office
renovation project nearing completion in El Segundo.</TE>
<TE>   M. David Paul and Jeffrey Worthe, principals, M. David Paul &amp;
Associates, Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Background: Opportunistic office developer had been faring well
with its multiphase project near the Burbank airport and also took
over a long-stalled development in the heart of the city's Media
District. Why watchable: A year ago it looked as if the firm's Media
District office project was bound to become a barometer of near-term
tenant demand in the Tri-Cities. That hasn't changed--and the market
continues to anticipate the first big tenancy announcement.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas Colonna and William Lindsay, partners, Pacific Coast
Capital Partners, El Segundo.</TE>
<TE>   Background: Former real estate banker and lawyer hooked up with
other veterans to form firm teaming capital resources with promising
projects.</TE>
<TE>   Why watchable: They've helped South Bay stalwart Overton Moore
Properties successfully develop and sell a major industrial park and
shopping center, and they now have office projects in the works.</TE>

Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Background: Leasing broker oversees tenant deals at the Warner
Center district's signature 2.3-million-square-foot assemblage of
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Why watchable: The 315,000 square feet HealthNet is vacating at
one of the Warner Center Plaza high-rises Hudson handles is one of
the L.A. area's biggest "holes" of existing high-quality office
space.</TE>

<DH>Ski Demski, Flag-Man Extraordinaire, Has a Special Reason Why
Today's Fiesta Bowl Is Meaningful</DH>

<LD>"O\o7 ld Glory."</LD>
<LD>   May she always fly high and free\f7</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   So reads the inscription at the base of the 132-foot pole in the front
yard of the Southland's star spangled manor.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas "Ski" Demski lives here. He does flags.</TE>
<TE>   Painted on his car, painted on the side of this converted Long Beach
duplex, flying so largely atop that pole that he had to fight city
fathers to keep it there.</TE>
<TE>   "Something about the flapping being in violation of the noise
ordinance," he says. "But you can't silence Old Glory."</TE>
<TE>   Nor its owner, a 72-year-old rascal best described as Old Glorious.</TE>
<TE>   In the cackling home he shares with two dozen birds, Demski has flags
on his walls, and over his floors, his light switches and his heart.
Literally.</TE>
<TE>   There are flags covering his entire torso, tattooed forever on the
chest of the free and the back of the brave.</TE>
<TE>   Right next to the tattooed phone numbers of his doctors.</TE>
<TE>   One of them solemnly met Demski in an examining room last summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Ski, I've got bad news for you."</TE>
<TE>   "What is it, doc?"</TE>
<TE>   "You've got my wrong number."</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to flags, Demski wears them, bares them, dares them.</TE>
<TE>   But mostly, he shares them.</TE>
<TE>   With folks like us, in places we can understand.</TE>
<TE>   Demski is the guy who rents the giant flags to the giant sports
events.</TE>
<TE>   The compelling flag that nearly covered the Dodger Stadium field in
their first home game after the Sept. 11 tragedy? That odd-looking fellow
marching alongside it was Demski.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for the use of Old Glory, he wanted to appear Half Monty,
topless, with his flag tattoos in full view. The Dodgers said no. He
brought the flag anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the sacrifices you make," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That flapping, emotion-building flag that sprawled across the Rose
Bowl field in UCLA's first football game after the tragedy? Demski again.</TE>
<TE>   He has supplied the flags for everything from Army-Navy football games
to the Super Bowl. Since the World Trade Center tragedies, he has been
working since the dawn's early light, filling flag orders from a nation
that finally shares his national pride.</TE>
<TE>   His latest triumph will appear today, during the pregame show at the
Fiesta Bowl, when 300 band members will unfurl a flag the size of the Sun
Devil Stadium football field.</TE>
<TE>   If recent flag ceremonies are any indication, some will have tears,
others will have goose bumps.</TE>
<TE>   Ski Demski will have a little of both.</TE>
<TE>   Because he is dying.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about your star-spangled ironies.</TE>
<TE>   Just as the rest of the country is catching up to the fervor of one of
its leading 72-year-old patriots, the flag man is out of breath.</TE>
<TE>   It's his heart. He's already had one multiple bypass operation and the
arteries are clogged again and nothing more can be done.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer he passed out twice at home and nearly died.</TE>
<TE>   This winter, for the first time in several years, Demski couldn't play
Santa Claus for the local kids.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in 15 years, he did not accompany his flag to the
Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "All I do is lay around and sleep," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm fighting to keep him from giving up," said best friend Jim
Alexander.</TE>
<TE>   Demski hopes they broadcast his Fiesta pregame event on television,
hopes there are enough people there to spread his flag across the field
and give it the respect it deserves.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of a life that Sept. 11 has transformed from eccentric to
compelling, Demski fittingly said it's not about him.</TE>
<TE>   It's about the flags.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just waiting to roll over and die," he said quietly in an
interview Sunday in his cluttered home. "But my flags, I have made sure
that they will always fly."</TE>
<TE>   Like any man whose collection includes the world's largest flag--it
cost $80,000, weighs 3,000 pounds, and covers nearly three football
fields--Ski Demski can dazzle you with numbers.</TE>
<TE>   But none are more compelling than this:</TE>
<TE>   In 21 years owning and displaying flags in all parts of the country,
none have been vandalized.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing stolen, nothing burned, nothing clipped, nothing tagged.</TE>
<TE>   On a street filled with barred windows, his giant flagpole stands
unmarked, while a painted flag and surrounding eagle remain untouched.</TE>
<TE>   "The flag, I guess, is one thing everyone understands," Demski said.</TE>
<TE>   Driving up the freeway 21 years ago, disabled from his construction
job because of a back injury, Demski understood.</TE>
<TE>   He saw a giant flag flapping from a pole in front of a car dealership.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, that really looks good," he recalled. "I thought, why not
try that?"</TE>
<TE>   Unmarried, with no children and no job, perhaps Demski saw the flag as
one part of the American dream that he could own.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing as he was never in the military--he worked in the Pennsylvania
coal mines, he said--maybe he felt he had some catching up to do.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the reason, and Demski isn't exactly sure himself, he drove
home and erected the flag pole. And began buying flags. And soon he
became one of the few people in the country to buy and rent the big ones.</TE>
<TE>   He made his money printing bumper stickers. But he made his impact
with stars and stripes.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone like me was really drawn to him," said Alexander, a retired
Coast Guard commander who helps run the Super Flags company. "He really
loves his country."</TE>
<TE>   Demski's company draped flags on the Washington Monument, Hoover Dam,
in county fairs and veterans events everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   After 15 years and one heart operation, he had become so associated
with flags, he didn't blink at a tattoo artist's idea during a talk show.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy saw my bypass scar and said, 'You know, that would make a
great natural flag pole,"' Demski said. "So I got my first tattoo."</TE>
<TE>   Five years later, he is covered with them, highlighted by a flag
outline of the United States on his back.</TE>
<TE>   Some found him weird. President Bush's people found him charming. Last
winter, Demski and Alexander and their flag became the only
sole-California entries in the inaugural parade.</TE>
<TE>   None of which prepared him for the outpouring of emotion--and
business--after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody told me it was like everyone was just realizing what I've
always known," Demski said. "It was really something."</TE>
<TE>   It was also really expensive. Their http://superflag.com web site was
overloaded, so it cost them to expand it. While they never made any money
on the flag rentals, the increase in travel costs caused them to lose
money.</TE>
<TE>   The bills have mounted about the same time Demski's ability to travel
has stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "He stuck his neck out as far as he could," said Alexander.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been quite depressed," said Demski.</TE>
<TE>   His last big trip was to New York, where he managed to reach Ground
Zero and fly one of his flags from a crane.</TE>
<TE>   He cradled his WTC identification card in his hand like a jewel. He
sighed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is so hard," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It's gotten so bad, he's even put the world's largest flag up for
sale, $100,000, because Demski is worried that it's not being shown
enough.</TE>
<TE>   "These flags deserve more than I've been able to give them," he said,
shaking his head.</TE>
<TE>   He misses the eyes of those holding the giant flag for the first time
... and the squeals of those who get briefly caught underneath it.</TE>
<TE>   He already missed one trademark moment, at Phoenix's Bank One Ballpark
during the recent Insight.Com Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before the game, Alexander had rounded up only 36 fireman for
a unfurling job that required 150 people. He asked the fireman to go into
the stands for help.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the flag had been carried from the mobile home to the end
zone, there were 200 people waiting to grab and flap.</TE>
<TE>   "The best thing about all this is, it brings people together," Demski
said.</TE>
<TE>   And ultimately leaves them alone. Demski spent Thanksgiving by
himself, in bed. Same for Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing I can do right now," he said, looking at bottles of
unopened pills on his aging desk. "Everything is coming down at once."</TE>
<TE>   Old Glorious has already planned his wake and funeral. A couple of
years ago, he even held a dress rehearsal with friends.</TE>
<TE>   A hypnotist calmed him enough so he could lay for an hour in a
plexiglass, mirrored casket in his garage while his friends ate corned
beef sandwiches.</TE>
<TE>   The casket is plexiglass and mirrored, of course, so everyone could
see the tattoos on both sides of his torso.</TE>
<TE>   The plan is for a cremation, with the casket to be brought out on the
anniversary of his death and donated as a coffee table for the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   His ashes? What do you think?</TE>
<TE>   He has ordered them placed into the golden eagle at the top of his
flag pole, above the ashes of a friend whose remains are already stashed
inside the pole.</TE>
<TE>   "A good place, don't you think?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   May he always fly high and free.</TE>

<HD>A Good Make-Up Call for Irish</HD>
<DH>Saving Face Might Be White's Saving Grace</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Notre Dame took a bold, historic and progressive step Monday when
it hired Tyrone Willingham as football coach, but we're going to hold off
on nominating the school for a Nobel Prize.</LD>
<LD>   The Irish should be commended for making Willingham the first minority
head coach in the history of Notre Dame athletics, but let's not forget,
this is the same guy who could have been hired three weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   Did Willingham improve that much as a coach in the time Athletic
Director Kevin White first took a pass on him?</LD>
<TE>   Actually, no. In his last act as head farmer on the Farm, Willingham's
Stanford Cardinal laid an egg in the Seattle Bowl, losing to Georgia Tech
on Dec. 27.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinal looked totally uninspired, and emotional lapses are
usually blamed on the coach.</TE>
<TE>   What took place between the time White received permission to speak to
Willingham, but never did, and Monday's news that Willingham would lead
Notre Dame football was not an epiphany of civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, it was a case of the worm turning.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks ago, White's cursory pursuit of Willingham smacked of
political appeasement and looked like a smokescreen. He jetted to
California in early December after receiving permission to speak to
Willingham about the job. Instead, he secretly sounded out other
left-coast candidates, Jon Gruden of the Oakland Raiders and Steve
Mariucci of the San Francisco 49ers.</TE>
<TE>   When neither man could be pried from his post, White made a beeline
for Atlanta and hired Georgia Tech's George O'Leary.</TE>
<TE>   African American leaders in the business of tracking minority hires
were not especially amused that Willingham might have been used as a red
herring in this coaching search.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt that it was kind of a slap in the face," Floyd Keith,
executive director of the Black Coaches Assn., said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   As we know, though, the O'Leary hire blew up in Notre Dame's face on
Dec. 15 when it was learned the new coach had falsified biographical
information.</TE>
<TE>   O'Leary resigned five days after accepting the job.</TE>
<TE>   The whole sordid mess checked in at 10 out of 10 on the Notre Dame
humiliation meter and White suddenly was in a desperate situation of
having to save face for himself and the university. Everyone knew White
needed to hit a home run on his second chance ... or else.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, what about Ty Willingham?</TE>
<TE>   Not only did the Stanford coach have an impeccable reputation--a must
in the aftermath of the O'Leary fiasco--but making Willingham the first
black coach in Notre Dame history would make White's second-chance hire
unassailable.</TE>
<TE>   Keith says he doesn't much care about the motivations or machinations
behind Willingham's hiring, only that Notre Dame got it right in the end.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a greater power in all of this than anything else,"
Keith said. "I think Tyrone was supposed to be at Notre Dame. What
transpired before, I really don't know. I'm going to give Notre Dame
credit, and I'm going to give the selection team credit and I'm going to
give Kevin White credit for making the hard choice."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, whatever the means or motivation, Notre Dame got it right.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish got a quality coach who comes complete with all the dull
attributes that might have soured the school on Willingham in the first
place.</TE>
<TE>   If you're of the opinion the Notre Dame coach needs to have a little
Blarney in him, a la Lou Holtz, then Willingham is not your man. Although
fronting a public relations giant is part of being the coach, Willingham
is probably not going to work the student body into a frenzy during the
Friday night pep rallies at the Joyce Center.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham is a serious, cerebral type. He is meticulous and
fastidious. He speaks in calculated clips. You picture him stepping up to
the rostrum at his first Notre Dame pep rally, opening his day organizer,
and diagraming for students the intricacies of the "cover 2" defense.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Holtz, Willingham is not going to drip like hot wax his love
for the Notre Dame, or sandbag his opponents, or affectionately refer to
an annual service academy opponent as "the University of Navy."</TE>
<TE>   At face value, Willingham's seven-year record of 44-36-1 at Stanford
is worse, by percentage points, than the five-year record that led to Bob
Davie's dismissal.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Stanford and Notre Dame are completely different football
animals. What Willingham accomplished amid relative indifference in Palo
Alto is not to be dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   He was twice named Pac-10 coach of the year, in 1995 and 1999, and led
the Cardinal this year to a record of 9-3, only the eighth time in school
history a Stanford squad has won at least nine games.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, with less talent, he defeated Notre Dame two out of the
last three years. No one would deny that Notre Dame, year in and year
out, recruits higher quality athletes than Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   As Keith said, "It'll be nice to see what he'll be able to do with a
Mercedes."</TE>
<TE>   On the flip side, not only will Willingham have to endure the scrutiny
all Notre Dame coaches deal with, he also will be under additional
pressure in his position of being the most high-profile minority coach in
sports.</TE>
<TE>   His success or failure may dictate how many other minorities land
Division I coaching jobs.</TE>
<TE>   As it stands, only four of the nation's 117 Division I football
coaches are black.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still less than 4%, so whom are we kidding," Keith says of the
minuscule progress made on this front. "But in a positive vein, with this
being the type of job that's considered one of the most prestigious jobs
in the country, it serves notice to those involved making those decision
that we need to examine the capabilities of those individuals that are
qualified. What I'm saying, in the bigger picture, is that there are
other Tyrone Willinghams out there."</TE>
<TE>   Keith hopes Willingham will kick-start a sport that has been
dramatically derelict in putting minority candidates in top-level
coaching positions.</TE>
<TE>   The Southeastern Conference, for example, has never had a minority
head football coach.</TE>
<TE>   "Take note, SEC," Keith said, "that Notre Dame made this decision."</TE>
<TE>   Keith thinks Willingham will answer the challenges, on the field and
off, but no one is saying this is going to be easy.</TE>
<TE>   In Monday's on-line edition of the South Bend Tribune, there was,
coincidentally juxtaposed, a picture of Willingham opposite a story about
the Ku Klux Klan's increased presence in Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   A farm in Osceola, not far from the Notre Dame campus, has in the last
year become the home of Richard Loy, the Klan's grand dragon in Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, before Christmas, the Klan held a party that included a
cross burning on the farm.</TE>
<TE>   It is encouraging to report that South Bend Tribune columnist Nancy J.
Sulok's story about the Klan's presence tells of how many in the
community are rising up to fight the organization's infiltration.</TE>
<TE>   The point only underscores that Willingham-to-Notre Dame is more than
the story of a coach and a university coming to contractual terms.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham's hiring changes the complexion of college football.</TE>
<TE>   Doors for black college basketball coaches were kicked open, thanks to
the successes of George Raveling, John Chaney and John Thompson.
Willingham has a chance to do the same in college football.</TE>
<TE>   "One of these days the phone calls won't have to be about us saying,
'Hey, a minority got hired here,"' Keith said.</TE>
<TE>   "We can just say a quality candidate got hired."</TE>

<DH>College football: Nebraska's 'Blackshirt' defenders want to put
Colorado loss in past with a Rose Bowl victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dion Booker will never forget the day he became ordained.</LD>
<LD>   It was during a Nebraska practice in 1999. Coaches stopped drills and
players formed a circle around Booker, a sophomore safety.</LD>
<LD>   In a rite that is almost as old as corn, a coach tossed Booker a black
practice jersey, symbolic of his being named to the first defensive unit.</LD>
<TE>   "You get to take off your yellow shirt you had on before," Booker
recalled this week. "The rest of the day you're on Cloud Nine."</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Slechta, a senior defensive tackle, received his "Blackshirt"
before the 2000 season, during a defensive meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Slechta still gets chills recalling when the coach said: \o7 you're a
Blackshirt, here's your jersey.\f7</TE>
<TE>   "It stays with you where ever you go," Slechta said. "You'll always be
a Blackshirt."</TE>
<TE>   Only when you consider this context can you understand the depths of
Nebraska's 62-36 loss to Colorado on Nov. 23. It was more than a loss;
it's the reason Cornhusker defenders see Thursday's national title game
against Miami in the Rose Bowl as the ultimate chance at redemption.</TE>
<TE>   To Blackshirts past and present, the Colorado loss was an
abomination--the equivalent of a football court marshal. The 62 points
were the most allowed by a Nebraska defense. As much as the final score
was an affront, so was the manner in which Colorado imposed its will, the
Buffalo offensive line forging massive gaps in the Nebraska defense.</TE>
<TE>   "One of our biggest defensive goals is to have 10 or less breakdowns
during a game," defensive end Chris Kelsay said. "There'd be times in the
Colorado game where we'd have two or three breakdowns on a single play."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado amassed 582 total yards, 380 on the ground. Buffalo tailback
Chris Brown, a reserve, gained 198 yards in 24 carries and scored on runs
of 12, one, 36, one, 13 and eight yards.</TE>
<TE>   The Colorado offense gained an average of 8.6 yards per play.</TE>
<TE>   "It was depressing, a horrible feeling," Nebraska cornerback Keyou
Craver said. "To see a team run up and down the field on the Blackshirts
like that.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a bad, bitter taste that we have in our mouth right now,
and what better way to get it out than to beat the No. 1 team in the
land."</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the Colorado defeat had all but wrecked Nebraska's
national title hopes. Traditionally, a wipeout loss that late in the
season would have doomed the Cornhuskers, yet an extraordinary string of
upsets allowed Nebraska to rise in the bowl championship series standings
and claim the national title game berth by five one-hundredths of a point
over Colorado in the final BCS standings.</TE>
<TE>   This bit of serendipity has given the Blackshirts a chance to redeem
their name on a national stage.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think most people on this team can really get over the
Colorado loss until after this game," Craver said.</TE>
<TE>   Becoming a starter on the Nebraska defense is more than a promotion;
it's an initiation into a fraternal order.</TE>
<TE>   The tradition of the Blackshirts began innocently enough and, somewhat
ironically, was hatched by two Notre Dame graduates, George Kelly and
Mike Corgan.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1960s, Kelly and Corgan were assistant coaches on
Nebraska coach Bob Devaney's staff. One day, Corgan and Kelly went to a
local sporting goods store to purchase practice jerseys for the defense.</TE>
<TE>   The shop owner said he could unload some black jerseys real cheap.
Kelly and Corgan figured black would be a nice contrast color and bought
the jerseys.</TE>
<TE>   And so a tradition began.</TE>
<TE>   "They deemed the first team would be the 'Blackshirts,"' George
Darlington, a Nebraska assistant coach for 29 years, said. "The second
unit was the 'Goldshirts' and the 'Green Weenies' were the third team,
they wore green shirts."</TE>
<TE>   Darlington said the Blackshirts started taking on mythical status in
Nebraska lore during the school's national championship seasons of 1970
and 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Seven defensive players off the 1971 team were named to the Big Eight
Conference's first team, while four earned consensus All-American honors
in their careers.</TE>
<TE>   Those national title squads boasted two Outland Trophy winners in Rich
Glover and Larry Jacobson.</TE>
<TE>   "They were a dominant defensive football team," Darlington said. "They
played in the 'Game of the Century' against Oklahoma and that's where the
Blackshirts really took off from the standpoint that this is a group of
men that are very special."</TE>
<TE>   Darlington said the team is very selective in awarding the special
jerseys. He said most years there are only 13 or 14 handed out.</TE>
<TE>   "On the very rare occasion that one is ever taken away, it's a very
traumatic thing," he said. "Because that means you've not played well or
not given very good effort. You would lose your Blackshirt if you really
screwed up as far as effort and performance."</TE>
<TE>   While there are only 11 starters on defense, the team uses some
discretion in awarding Blackshirts because some reserves end up playing
as much or more as some starters.</TE>
<TE>   In another tradition, all senior defensive players receive Blackshirts
on the first day of practice at the site of Nebraska's bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   This year, six Nebraska reserves received their shirts in Los Angeles
before the team began preparations for the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, this year's Blackshirts are aware they have sullied their jerseys
and know that beating Miami is the only way to win back honor.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a fraternity," Kelsay said. "It is an elite group of guys who
have been the very best defensive players who've come to Nebraska. You
earn your Blackshirt, it isn't given to you, and it's something that's
with you the rest of your life."</TE>
<TE>   And that's why "62" is the loneliest number.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the most points put up against any Nebraska defense," Kelsay
said. "To be a part of that is disappointing and embarrassing to some
extent. We have guys all over the nation watching every game we play. We
let them down, we let ourselves down, it's a huge disappointment."</TE>
<TE>   Kelsay said returning to Lincoln after the Colorado game was the low
point of his career. Not only did he have to sit through a film session
of the debacle, Kelsay quickly found out he was no longer a big man on
campus.</TE>
<TE>   People looked at him differently.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of the biggest things I noticed right away," he said. "You
see your friends, and you have to show your face in class after being on
top all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Kelsay said there is really nothing the Blackshirts can do except take
the loss like men.</TE>
<TE>   At Sunday's media day, Nebraska defenders faced wave after wave of
questions about the Colorado defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of overwhelming to be bombarded with questions about
Colorado," he said, "but that's the price you pay when you get beat like
that."</TE>
<TE>   Darlington says the breakdowns on defense against Colorado were
complete.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just about everything," he said. "We were dominated at the
line of scrimmage. We overran things tremendously. We could say we had a
great scheme and our players just stunk. At the same time, we can't say
that the players didn't get hammered pretty good, too."</TE>
<TE>   Darlington says the approach for Miami has been to "shore up and get
quality reps against things that can hurt us in the running game."</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska players can't imagine getting hammered again the way they did
in Boulder.</TE>
<TE>   The memory haunts and inspires them.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we've got a lot to prove to the nation," Kelsay said.
"We've got to show them the type of team we really have. \o7 This\f7  is
the real Nebraska team. \o7 These\f7  are the real Blackshirts. That's
our big motivation."</TE>

<HD>A Good Make-Up Call for Irish</HD>
<DH>College football: Moving to repair damage caused by O'Leary fiasco,
Notre Dame hires a respected coach with a clean resume--Stanford's
Willingham.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tyrone Willingham, stoic, erudite and--most relevantly--above
reproach, was hired as Notre Dame football coach Monday, little more than
two weeks after George O'Leary resigned in the wake of revelations that
he fabricated biographical information about his playing and academic
careers.</LD>
<LD>   Willingham, the coach at Stanford the last seven years, becomes the
first African American to coach any sport at Notre Dame. He directed the
Cardinal to a surprising 9-3 record this season, finishing his tenure
with a 24-14 loss to Georgia Tech in the Seattle Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Willingham agreed to a six-year deal worth between $2 million and $3
million a year, according to his agent, Ray Anderson. John Heisler, a
Notre Dame associate athletic director, confirmed the length of the
contract but indicated it is less lucrative. Willingham will be
introduced today at a news conference in South Bend, Ind.</LD>
<TE>   Bob Davie was fired Dec. 2 as coach of the Fighting Irish after
posting a 5-6 record this season, his fifth. Willingham was among
contenders for the job at that time, but Notre Dame officials did not
interview him and instead moved quickly to hire O'Leary, the coach at
Georgia Tech.</TE>
<TE>   Within days it was revealed that O'Leary's resume had two major
discrepancies, one listing him as a three-time letter winner at New
Hampshire, the other claiming he had obtained a master's degree from New
York University. Neither was true.</TE>
<TE>   When O'Leary resigned only five days after taking the job, many of the
same marquee names came up that had circulated after Davie's firing,
including Jon Gruden of the Oakland Raiders and Steve Mariucci of the San
Francisco 49ers. In addition, Rick Neuheisel of Washington and former
Irish Coach Lou Holtz, now at South Carolina, were mentioned.</TE>
<TE>   Athletic Director Kevin White took heat from critics who said he hired
O'Leary too hastily, and Notre Dame President Rev. Edward A. Malloy, who
has urged the school to diversify, might have had a hand in the selection
of Willingham.</TE>
<TE>   "This opens up a lot of doors for a lot of people," said Floyd Keith,
executive director of the Black Coaches Assn. "We have minority
candidates out there that just haven't been considered before. There are
other Tyrone Willinghams out there."</TE>
<TE>   The new coach has developed a reputation as a meticulous, disciplined
and driven individual. Although his record of 44-36-1 at Stanford is
similar to Davie's 35-25 mark at Notre Dame, and he won only one of four
bowl games, Willingham is admired for his integrity and leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "It is critical that I set the tone for how the entire program should
flow by the example I provide," he said before the 2001 season. "With
this style of leadership comes a level of expectation where the
underachiever becomes the achiever and the achiever reaches his true
greatness."</TE>
<TE>   Before Stanford defeated Notre Dame, 17-13, on Nov. 24--the Cardinal's
second victory over the Irish in three years--Willingham talked about the
two schools.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good to look at records and standards, but it's more important
to remember the process of producing a consistent winner, and that starts
early on each week before the games are played," he said. "Both of our
schools have high expectations, and we're trying to live up to ours all
week, not just on Saturdays."</TE>
<TE>   Willingham, who turned 48 on Sunday, should immediately help Notre
Dame's recruiting, which is at a crisis point. Several Irish assistants
were pulled off recruiting trips when O'Leary was hired and the
uncertainty created by his resignation caused more disarray.</TE>
<TE>   But Willingham is familiar with recruiting obstacles. Admissions
policies at Stanford are even more stringent than at Notre Dame and the
recruiting pool is smaller.</TE>
<TE>   Not only might a greater number of elite African American players warm
to South Bend now, so might skill-position players who believed the Notre
Dame offense was too conservative under Davie.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Chris Olsen of New Jersey made an early commitment to the
Fighting Irish but took other visits in the last month. Trent Edwards, an
uncommitted quarterback from Los Gatos, favored Stanford and admires
Willingham. Signing day is Feb. 3 and a dead period for recruiting ends
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Current Notre Dame players are expected to welcome the new coach,
whose hiring brings an end to the uncertainty caused by the embarrassing
O'Leary fiasco.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to respect him and welcome him just like they did when I
came in," cornerback Vontez Duff said. "With all the things that have
gone on the past few weeks, I think they've looked him over pretty close
and I think he'll be a good choice."</TE>
<TE>   Willingham, a native of Jacksonville, N.C., was a walk-on quarterback
at Michigan State in 1973, choosing the school partly because he looked
up to former Spartan Jimmy Raye, also a black quarterback from North
Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just one of those things that hang in your subconscious, that
you don't know why they're there, but at some point it ties in,"
Willingham told The Times' Robyn Norwood in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame no doubt double-checked Willingham's resume. He earned a
scholarship as a Michigan State sophomore, won three letters in football
and baseball and was named the football team's most inspirational player
in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [Michigan State] is well-documented for providing opportunity
for African American players and coaches before it was popular around the
country," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After stints as an assistant at Michigan State, Stanford and with the
Minnesota Vikings, Willingham became head coach of the Cardinal and in
1999 became the first black coach to lead a team to the Rose Bowl.</TE>

<LD>Today we try again. Today we get a new opportunity to get it right,
to regroup, to rebuild, while remembering a promise that went so wrong
365 days ago.</LD>
<LD>   Happy New Year?</LD>
<LD>   During a fretful 12 months in which two of the biggest sports stories
involved the Notre Dame football coach lying on his resume and a star
Little League pitcher lying about his age, the first untruth of 2001 was
uttered, by millions, just as soon as the clock struck midnight on 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Sports are supposed to be our playthings, our diversions, our respite
from the everyday madness of real life. But in 2001, a year marred by
national tragedy, terrorism and war, there was no escape from the
sadness, not when the nightly sports news was leading off with coverage
of another memorial service, or the filing of another wrongful death
lawsuit, or the discovery of another piece of evidence in the latest
athletic scandal.</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR opened its Winston Cup season Feb. 28 with what looked to be a
made-for-TV feel-good story: Michael Waltrip, winless in 462 career
starts, finally reaching the victory stand at the Daytona 500.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes of Waltrip crossing the finish line, however, his
triumph had become an afterthought. On the final lap, seconds away from a
third-place finish, Dale Earnhardt, the folk hero of American stock car
racing, was killed when his famous No. 3 car crashed into the wall
between turns 3 and 4.</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota Vikings, who finished one step short of Super Bowl V,
reassembled in August to begin preparations for clearing the final
hurdle. On a brutally hot day at the team's training camp in Mankato,
Minn., Korey Stringer, the Vikings' Pro Bowl offensive tackle, staggered
off the practice field, suffering from heatstroke, and died in a nearby
hospital hours later.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, Rashidi Wheeler, starting safety at Northwestern
University, collapsed during workouts and died. For the next month, the
sports page seemed to have mutated into the obituary page, with one
report of a football player's death following another. By the end of the
year, at least 17 football players in 2001 had died suddenly, including
17-year-old Matt Colby of Costa Mesa High.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Oklahoma State's basketball program lost two players and
six staff members in a plane crash.</TE>
<TE>   In September, the University of Wyoming lost eight cross-country
runners in an automobile accident.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, the drum banged slowly as some of the brightest
personalities to enliven the sporting landscape faded from view--and can
you think of a more entertaining talk-show format than Dick Schaap
tossing up questions for a panel of Al McGuire, John McKay, Bill Rigney,
Willie Stargell and George Young?</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 11 attacks, sports was shuttered for a week--no
baseball, no NFL, and, after no small amount of public prodding, no
college football. The game postponements were unprecedented, as was the
brief moment of introspection and self-analysis the industry afforded
itself between pregame shows.</TE>
<TE>   What does the outcome of a baseball game mean when bodies are being
pulled from the rubble of what used to be the World Trade Center? How
important are halftime scores while a nation grieves? With the Pentagon a
terrorist target, shouldn't the hackneyed war metaphors--running backs as
"weapons," fastballs as "ammunition"--be shelved, now and forever? Why do
we call $250-million, .318-hitting shortstops "heroes" when New York
firefighters are risking their lives trying to save others minutes before
a tower collapses?</TE>
<TE>   These were questions worth asking, even if the answers were
obvious--and soon ignored, once the games returned and routine was
restored and football fans in Cleveland were back to pelting officials
with beer bottles because a crucial call had just knocked their team out
of playoff contention.</TE>
<TE>   (Worth noting, and remembering: ESPN's best week of journalism in 2001
occurred during the week after the attacks, when the network sidelined
its customary cast of Amateur Night at the Improv acts and turned
"SportsCenter" over to Bob Ley. Giving us the necessary news and
thoughtful analysis, Ley demonstrated how high the show can aspire when
the on-air talent does more than audition next week's smirk-along-with-us
catchphrases.)</TE>
<TE>   At their best, sports should both amaze and amuse, leaving us shaking
our heads and smiling at what we've just seen. But in 2001, several of
the headline-making athletes gave us only half the equation, the feat
without the fun.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco Giant outfielder Barry Bonds broke Mark McGwire's
supposedly unbreakable single-season home run record, finishing with an
unthinkable 73. But has there ever been a more joyless pursuit of a major
record? In 1998, when McGwire and Sammy Sosa resuscitated baseball with
their hugs-and-homers chase of Roger Maris, sportswriters nodded along
with a nation transfixed by at-bat updates and mused, "Think it would be
like this if Bonds was going for the record?"</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, we had our answer. After a decade spent alienating
himself from teammates, media and fans, Bonds went after the most
hallowed mark in sports, owned by the popular McGwire, and once he
reached 65, found himself greeted by boos on the road and opposing
pitchers wanting to avoid the issue entirely.</TE>
<TE>   Intentionally walked and ignored until the season's last week, Bonds
eclipsed the record in San Francisco, against the Dodgers, hitting Nos.
71 and 72 in a game that lasted so long, the ceremony to commemorate the
record began after midnight. Bonds seemed so stunned at the response from
the home fans--they actually stayed, they actually cheered--that he broke
down and cried.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, despite his phenomenal statistical totals (137 runs batted in,
.515 on-base percentage, .863 slugging percentage), Bonds was an unwanted
man in the free-agent market. Partly because of his age, 38, but partly
because of his baggage, Bonds received no multiyear offers to his liking
and wound up agreeing to arbitration, and one more season, with the
Giants.</TE>
<TE>   The 2001 Super Bowl was won by a worst-case scenario in shoulder pads,
the Baltimore Ravens, who, in fairness, should be commended for combining
all that ails professional football today into one tidy package.</TE>
<TE>   A run-for-the-money relocation case from Cleveland, the Ravens played
the most cynical brand of football in memory, reining in their limited
quarterback in a no-risk offense that played for defensive field position
and waited for turnovers. They were arrogant and obnoxious, led by a
coach, Brian Billick, who figured Lombardi would have gone 8-8 with the
same group, and a linebacker, Ray Lewis, who had begun 2000 as a
double-murder suspect and freed himself to play by pleading to a lesser
charge.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jordan returned after a three-year retirement from basketball,
and immediately wondered what happened to the love. Reaction to his
comeback ranged from indifference (it's a Shaq-Kobe world now) to disdain
(he's spoiling his perfect ending!) to ridicule (Err Jordan). Even close
friends such as Charles Barkley wondered what Jordan was thinking and
feared for his safety.</TE>
<TE>   For two months, he looked pretty much like what you'd expect from a
rusty 38-year-old superstar playing for a bad team--more jumpers than
glides to the hoop, a decent performance followed by an awful one. Then,
just before year's end, Jordan decided it was high time to remind his
jaded audience of what the original equipment used to manage and scored
51 and 45 points in consecutive games during 2001's final week.</TE>
<TE>   How old is too old? In the case of the Little League World Series, the
answer is 14, which was the actual age of Bronx pitcher Danny Almonte
when he competed for the Rolando Paulino All-Stars.</TE>
<TE>   This, then, was the reason Almonte blew fastballs past 11-and
12-year-old hitters like some economy-sized Randy Johnson. Throughout the
World Series, there was media speculation that Almonte might be overage,
but ABC's coverage team gave the controversy passing notice, preferring
to hype the "Baby Bombers" and the "Baby Unit" and wonder what Almonte
was going to say at his Cooperstown induction speech.</TE>
<TE>   News of the scandal broke after the Series, when reporters tracked
down the boy's Dominican Republic birth certificate, revealing his true
age. All of Almonte's accomplishments--including a perfect game--were
stricken from the Little League record book, he and his father were
banned from Little League activities and his league was suspended from
future World Series competition.</TE>
<TE>   Deception was in vogue in 2001, and it had nothing to do with the
hidden-ball trick. Butch Davis lied to University of Miami players and
boosters, insisting he wasn't going anywhere while secretly finishing
negotiations to coach the Cleveland Browns. Notre Dame fired Bob Davie
after a 5-6 season, then hired Georgia Tech's George O'Leary, who held
the job for five days before being forced to resign when it was learned
he padded his resume with false athletic and educational histories.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers deked the country into thinking they were feuding and
vulnerable and there for the taking when they were merely pacing
themselves for a 15-1 playoff run and their second consecutive NBA
championship. Chick Hearn fooled us into thinking he would work forever,
then gave us a serious scare by undergoing heart surgery in December,
ending the greatest run in Los Angeles sports history--3,338 consecutive
games behind the microphone.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere locally, the nightly highlight shows delivered a mixed bag.
USC reached the Elite Eight and UCLA the Sweet 16 in men's college
basketball, followed a few months later by the Sparks winning the WNBA
title, prompting some declarations of "World Capital of Basketball" that
conveniently ignored the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   Then came football season, which saw UCLA threaten for two months for
a national championship, then finish 7-4 after two-thirds of its starting
backfield got caught in traffic--running back DeShaun Foster suspended
for driving a 2002 Ford Expedition that wasn't his, quarterback Cory Paus
benched for not disclosing two alcohol-related driving convictions to his
coaches. USC's major achievement was its victory over the mid-swoon
Bruins, which produced a trip to the Las Vegas Bowl, where the Trojans
netted one rushing yard and lost to Utah, 10-6.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings had a surprising run to the second round of the NHL
playoffs, upsetting Detroit in the first round and taking eventual
Stanley Cup winner Colorado seven games. But the Angels and the Ducks
were off the radar screen, as usual, and the Dodgers completed their 13th
consecutive season without a playoff victory, finishing third in the NL
West during a season distinguished by General Manager Kevin Malone
getting fired shortly after challenging a fan in San Diego to a fight.</TE>
<TE>   Worth cheering in 2001 were:</TE>
<TE>   * Cyclist Lance Armstrong, who extended his cancer-surviving Tour de
France championship streak to three.</TE>
<TE>   * Tiger Woods, who won the Masters to become the first golfer in the
modern era to hold all four major championships simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   * Jennifer Capriati, who won the Australian and French opens after
seemingly squandering her career before her 20s.</TE>
<TE>   * Venus Williams, who repeated as women's Wimbledon and U.S. Open
champion, defeating her sister Serena for the latter in an all-family
final in New York.</TE>
<TE>   * Goran Ivanisevic, who became the first wild-card entrant to win the
Wimbledon men's title.</TE>
<TE>   * Ray Bourque, who ended a 22-year quest and finally won the Stanley
Cup in his last NHL game.</TE>
<TE>   * Alan Webb, who broke Jim Ryun's 36-year-old high school record in
the mile by running 3:53.43.</TE>
<TE>   Today we try again, hoping for a new year better than what has just
passed. Initial signs, however, are ominous.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl, which usually is played today, won't kick off until
Thursday night, two days after the final parade float has been docked,
because the game is allegedly being played for the national championship,
even though one of the participants, Nebraska, did not win its conference
and lost its last game, 62-36.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball, coming off an exciting World Series that saw the 4-year-old
Arizona Diamondbacks upset the New York Yankees in seven games, is
talking contraction or work stoppage or both.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers just lost Chan Ho Park to the Texas Rangers, the Angels
are still owned by Disney and UCLA continues to lose to basketball teams
it ought to run off the court by halftime.</TE>
<TE>   But Hearn is due back at the announcer's table sometime this month,
Notre Dame hired a football coach with a nonfiction resume and there are
no XFL games on the calendar.</TE>
<TE>   It's still early, but there is reason for optimism.</TE>

<HD>Corn-Fed Remark Gives Nebraskan a Bad Taste</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It seems there was a misunderstanding when I wrote recently, "I
know the women in Nebraska are corn-fed and a little more substantial
than ourstarlets ... "</LD>
<LD>   I'm kicking myself now, of course, because when you're busy writing a
column, you make a number of changes until you finally send it in to be
printed, and originally I had written that line to read: "I know the
women in Nebraska are corn-fed and little more substantial--OK, a ton
more substantial--than our starlets ... "</LD>
<LD>   I chose to be concise, and now some people think I wasn't as
flattering as I could have been, when you can see I had every intention
of nearly going overboard to give the women of Nebraska their due for
being more well-rounded than our starlets.</LD>
<TE>   Tracey Kenny apparently mistook my compliment for some kind of
derogatory comment, which goes to show you she must not read Page 2 very
often. Kenny, who uses the e-mail moniker bighuskerfan, and I have no
doubt about that, wrote to say, "Comments like this are really out of
line. Take potshots at the BCS, but leave comparisons like this one out
of your column."</TE>
<TE>   Now I'd like to stop right here, and make a New Year's resolution to
take better direction from e-mailers this year--not starting my column
every day until I've been told what I should write about and what I
should leave out. This will render sports editor Bill Dwyre useless, of
course, so Happy New Year, indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Under Dwyre's guidance, I've only made people mad.</TE>
<TE>   "What you have written demeans women," wrote bighuskerfan, "and
suggests all Los Angeles women are starlets, which they are not, or all
women in Nebraska are huge, which they are not. I know women from
Nebraska that are model beautiful and women in Los Angeles that have lots
to lose. What does that have to do with the national championship game?"</TE>
<TE>   I'm afraid this has everything to do with the national championship
game.</TE>
<TE>   There are going to be more than 92,000 fans in the Rose Bowl on
Thursday--with half of those people sitting on benches built with the
expectation that each one of them will have a rump no wider than 17
inches--and with as many as 35 people to a row, if the rump runneth over,
you're going to have fans on the end of each row falling into the aisles.
If some Cornhusker decides to stretch in the third quarter, we're looking
at a major pileup.</TE>
<TE>   Considering the average rump of a Nebraskan, well, wouldn't it be a
fun Southwest Airlines ride to Omaha in the middle seat between two
Cornhusker fans. USA Today reported Monday that the Cornhuskers are
squeezing out Miami supporters--claiming 50,000 Nebraska fans may be
sitting in the Rose Bowl at game time.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine the chaos after the national anthem when a whole row of
25-inchers try to sit down at the same time. Once seated, and someone
gets up for a restroom break, we're talking about a real Nebraska land
grab here.</TE>
<TE>   Some of this, of course, hits close to home. We have one of those
curving couches that takes up two walls so that my wife has some place to
sit. It also doubles nicely as a bed when you make the mistake of asking
your wife if you can measure her rump to help out the column. I told her
there might be some starlets out there a little more cooperative, and you
know where she told me to go--Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   Now frankly, I hadn't given any thought to this until bighuskerfan
misinterpreted my remarks about the substantial women of Nebraska, but if
she really means what I think she means, it does raise the question: Do
50,000 fans from South Beach-Miami need less sitting room than 50,000
corn-fed Nebraskans?</TE>
<TE>   I asked Darryl Dunn, general manager of the Rose Bowl, "What happens
if there's a rump runover?" and he said, "That's when customer service
comes into play."</TE>
<TE>   I think I know their solution, but this could delay the start of the
national championship game and make quite a ruckus if Rose Bowl customer
service has to start rearranging the fans--putting a Miami fan next to
every Nebraska rump.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SAN DIEGO Charger General Manager John Butler told reporters he made
up his mind Sunday night to fire Coach Mike Riley, although everyone in
the NFL knows that Butler had come to that conclusion weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Butler refused to let Riley play rookie Drew Brees down the stretch
because it might have upset Doug Flutie, the Mission Bay Shrimp finishing
the season with nine consecutive losses.</TE>
<TE>   Butler was the GM in Buffalo, and before leaving that team a shambles,
he had been at the center of the Flutie-Rob Johnson controversy.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers still owe Flutie millions in guaranteed money, so Butler
must find a coach willing to pamper Flutie, which bodes well for Jet
defensive coordinator Ted Cottrell, who worked with Butler in Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   Some thought Norv Turner would be the next Charger coach, but Flutie
has been badmouthing him behind the scenes.</TE>
<TE>   Aren't you excited about the Chargers moving to L.A.?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ODDSMAKERS SAY it's 6-4 that Anna Kournikova wins her first official
tennis tournament this year. I intend to keep my eye on her to see if she
can do it.</TE>

<HD>For Collins, It Qualified as Coaching No-Brainer</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU> Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Washington Wizard Coach Doug Collins did not stick, wisely, to his
usual substitution pattern when Michael Jordan scored 24 points in the
first quarter Saturday against Charlotte.</LD>
<LD>   "When he's on a roll like that, you just ride it," Collins said. "You
don't start getting cute, start running plays for other people. That's
when you coach yourself right out of there."</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   More Jordan: Asked if he had seen coming Jordan's 51 points against
the Hornets, Wizard guard Chris Whitney said, "What am I, Miss Cleo? No
one knows how he does it. He just does it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the Rose Bowl game record for touchdowns?
(Hint, it's a tie.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The winner is: Bernie Lincicome of the Rocky Mountain News presents
his "Bernies," revealing what kind of year it was in sports. A sampling:</TE>
<TE>   * "Wanna Bet Who Will Be Missed Least Award--To the departing Cal
Ripken, Tony Gwynn, Mark McGwire and Juan Antonio Samaranch."</TE>
<TE>   * "This Is No Longer a Working Number Award--To the defunct XFL, the
Dennis Miller of football leagues."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Soccer is easier: Bud Geracie in the San Jose Mercury News on the
greatest hits of 2001:</TE>
<TE>   * "Soccer star Rio Ferdinand has a strained knee tendon suffered when
he kept his leg propped up on a coffee table for too long while watching
TV, and I know first hand how painful that can be."</TE>
<TE>   * "This wasn't the first time an Al Davis suit was rejected. Happens
to him all the time in the fashion world."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Selling himself: Chicago Bear quarterback Jim Miller, dismissing
speculation that his team is eyeing Drew Bledsoe as his replacement for
next season: "I laugh. You're getting the same quarterback. You are going
to pay a guy $100 million, and you are going to get the same exact thing
as what me and Shane [Matthews] are.</TE>
<TE>   "He might have a better arm, but other than that, he's not going to
scramble any more. He's not going to do any more."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Take that: Bryon Russell of the Utah Jazz, after scoring a season-high
19 points against the Boston Celtics: "They dare you to shoot the outside
shot. And I'm the wrong person to dare."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1930, USC routed Pittsburgh in the Rose
Bowl game, 47-14.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back again: On this day in 1976, UCLA defeated Ohio State in
the Rose Bowl game, 23-10. The Bruins had lost to the Buckeyes during the
regular season, 41-20.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Sam Cunningham of USC and Eric Ball of UCLA, four each,
in the 1973 and 1986 games against Ohio State and Iowa, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Fight doctor Ferdie Pacheco liked Will Smith and the
fight scenes in "Ali" but says the film contains "a horrible mishmash of
wrong information and wrong dates."</TE>
<TE>   Ali's wives, Sonji and Belinda, showed up at the wrong fights, Pacheco
wrote in the Tampa Tribune, and, "The most amazing omission is
overlooking how Ali conquers his three years in exile."</TE>
<TE>   Shunned by the Muslims, Pacheco says, Ali toured white college
campuses, which gave him the broad base of acceptance that he now has.</TE>

<LD>What: "Lost Treasures of NFL Films--Vol. XVI: Three Cheers for the
Redskins"</LD>
<LD>   Where: ESPN Classic, Wednesday, 6 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Our society is intrigued by people who are different, who tend to be
eccentric and quirky. A goofball, if you will. Maybe that explains the
fascination with George Allen.</LD>
<TE>   Sports Illustrated selected NFL Films' "Winning Is Living, Losing Is
Dying: the George Allen Story" as the best documentary of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Now NFL Films is coming back with another George Allen show, and it's
the early leader as best documentary of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   For the original in 1971, NFL Films followed the Washington Redskins
through their first season with Allen as their coach. They had a 9-4-1
record and made the playoffs for the first time since 1945.</TE>
<TE>   The remake is part of NFL Films' "Lost Treasure" series. Several
Redskin players were interviewed for the documentary.</TE>
<TE>   At the top of the show, host Steve Sabol, NFL Films president,
explains the original. "We went where no media outlet had ever gone
before, deep inside a George Allen team. Allen was a secretive man and
distrustful of the media. We were the only outsiders he felt he could
trust. We were along for the whole ride. He even let us film in his
office, which allowed us to see just what a quirky character he was."</TE>
<TE>   But during the shooting, Allen grew weary of the NFL Films crew and at
one point had them thrown out of a locker room.</TE>
<TE>   There's one scene in particular that shows what Allen was all about.
Receiver Roy Jefferson is stung by a bee in the locker room before a game
and says he is allergic to bee stings and could die. Allen is upset
because he believes Jefferson is thinking only about his own plight and
has become a distraction to the team.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a strange one," he says. "What's he doing, anyway? He's got 50
other guys to think about."</TE>

<HD>Mathis Injures Spine, but Is Out of Hospital</HD>

<LD>New Orleans Saint cornerback Kevin Mathis was released from a
hospital Monday after injuring his spine against the Washington Redskins
on Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   Mathis, who started all but one game for the Saints this season, was
hurt tackling Ki-Jana Carter in the third quarter. Replays showed Mathis'
head snapped back on the play.</LD>
<LD>   "When he was on the field, all of his extremities went numb, but they
came back," Saint Coach Jim Haslett said. "In the hospital overnight, his
legs came back. His arms are still a little weak. He'll be out this
week."</LD>
<TE>   Mathis never lost consciousness, Haslett said.</TE>
<TE>   After being released from the hospital, Mathis returned to Texas,
where his wife is due to have a baby.</TE>

<TE>   An incensed Arizona Coach Dave McGinnis said he called NFL officials
to complain about what he considered two cheap shots by the Carolina
Panthers in the Cardinals' 30-7 road victory on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   McGinnis said that Gene Washington, the league's director of
operations, assured him that Carolina end Brentson Buckner and center
Jeff Mitchell would be punished.</TE>
<TE>   "I was satisfied with the response I got," McGinnis said. "I knew that
they were going to look anyway, but I felt it was my responsibility to my
players to call and voice my opinion about what went on."</TE>
<TE>   Buckner gave quarterback Jake Plummer a forearm to the throat and
Mitchell hit end Fred Wakefield from behind below the knees. Plummer was
not seriously hurt, but Wakefield had to leave with an ankle injury.</TE>

<TE>   The Jacksonville Jaguars will reinstate R. Jay Soward to their roster
this week, but Coach Tom Coughlin said the receiver will neither practice
this week nor play Sunday against Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The Jaguars suspended Soward for violating team rules Dec. 7, two days
before their game against Cincinnati. Coughlin called it an indefinite
suspension, but NFL rules state no player can be suspended for more than
four games at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Since he has been out four games, Soward must return to the roster. It
means the former USC standout will get his game check, but will finish
the season without playing a down for the Jaguars.</TE>

<HD>Riley Swiftly Fired by the Chargers</HD>
<DH>Pro football: A day after season-ending ninth consecutive loss, the
coach courted by USC last off-season is ousted for 'bottom line' after
three ugly seasons in San Diego.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Diego Chargers won five times as many games this season as
they did in 2000, but that wasn't enough to save Coach Mike Riley's job.</LD>
<LD>   Riley, whose team finished with a nine-game losing streak, was fired
Monday after three seasons with the Chargers. The Chargers, a team that
went 1-15 last season, collapsed after a promising 5-2 start.</LD>
<LD>   "It just came down to one bottom line, and that's winning football
games," General Manager John Butler said at a news conference.
"Unfortunately, that didn't take place as much as we hoped this year and
previous years. That's the bottom line."</LD>
<TE>   Riley, 48, could well have become USC's coach a year ago. School
administrators met with him after Oregon State's Dennis Erickson and
Oregon's Mike Belotti had said they weren't interested in the job after
the firing of Paul Hackett. Riley could not guarantee he would take the
job if offered it, so the Trojans moved on to Pete Carroll, and
eventually hired him.</TE>
<TE>   Butler fired Riley only hours after a 25-22 loss to Seattle on Sunday.
It was the season finale for the Chargers, who finish with a bye and are
out of the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   Riley, typically upbeat, was so even in the face of the setback. He
met with reporters and said he'd expressed his gratitude to team
President Dean Spanos for entrusting him with his first NFL job.</TE>
<TE>   "The best thing in a deal like this is to be grateful, and I'm
grateful for this chance," said Riley, hired in January 1999 by
then-General Manager Bobby Beathard. "I appreciate the Spanos family. I
told Dean, I appreciated the opportunity. Not many people get to do
this."</TE>
<TE>   The only coach from Riley's staff who will be retained is offensive
coordinator Norv Turner, the former Washington Redskin coach who has
three years remaining on his contract. Asked if Turner is a candidate to
replace Riley, Butler said, "I haven't even given that any thought,
haven't talked about it, don't have any ideas on any successor right
now."</TE>
<TE>   The early favorite to replace Riley is Ted Cottrell, defensive
coordinator for the New York Jets. Butler is believed to be leaning
toward hiring a defense-minded coach, and Cottrell worked under him with
the Buffalo Bills from 1993-2000, the last three seasons as defensive
coordinator. Jet Coach Herman Edwards said he will allow the Chargers to
interview Cottrell if they ask.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be nice to get the interviews, because every time you do
that, you feel more at ease, and hopefully sooner or later someone says
yes to you and gives you the opportunity," Cottrell said.</TE>
<TE>   Butler has loaded the Charger front office and roster with former
Bills, notably quarterback Doug Flutie and end Marcellus Wiley.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers have fired three coaches--June Jones, Kevin Gilbride and
Riley--since Bobby Ross was forced out after the 1996 season.</TE>
<TE>   Although speculation swirled that Riley was gone, Butler said the
decision to fire him was made Sunday night. He added, however, that Riley
would not have saved his job by beating Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Riley has two years remaining on his contract and will collect $1.5
million. There is speculation he is a candidate for the vacant job at
Indiana University, where he would work under Athletic Director Michael
McNeely, a former Charger vice president and chief operating officer.
Stanford, which lost Coach Tyrone Willingham to Notre Dame, also might be
interested. Riley coached for two seasons at Oregon State before moving
to the Chargers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to jump into anything," he said. "I don't want to assume
anything. I want to coach, obviously, again. I'd like my next job to be
my last one. I would like to go and build something and be able to leave
something there that's good."</TE>

<TE>   Mike Riley was named the 12th head coach in Chargers' history on Jan.
10, 1999. He was head coach at Oregon State from 1997-98, in the Canadian
Football League with Winnipeg from 1987-1990, and in the World League
with San Antonio from 1991-92. At Winnipeg, he had a 40-32 record and won
two Grey Cup championships. Riley was named the CFL's coach of the year
after the 1988 and '90 seasons. He was fired by the Chargers on Monday.

<LD>Forward Darius Miles did not practice Monday because of an
infection. His status was termed questionable by the Clippers for
tonight's game against the Portland Trail Blazers.</LD>
<LD>   Swingman Lamar Odom also did not practice and was scheduled to have an
MRI exam on his sprained right wrist. X-rays taken last week were
negative. He is not expected to play tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Miles had filled in at small forward for Odom, who was sidelined the
last two games.</LD>
<TE>   Guard Eric Piatkowski is expected to start for the first time since
suffering a strained right hip Nov. 30 against the Denver Nuggets. He
seemed surprised when reporters broke the news to him after practice.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just so frustrating sitting on the bench," Piatkowski said. "I
can't stand it. This is my eighth year and I've rarely missed any games.
It was weird. It was a different feeling pulling up to the arena.
Usually, you're fired up. When you're not playing, it feels like
summertime."</TE>
<TE>   Piatkowski sat out 11 of 12 games, but played eight minutes Saturday
against the Boston Celtics. He said he felt out of sync Saturday and
during Sunday's practice, but said Monday he was more comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel funny on the floor right now," he said. "But today I felt
better. It takes time to get into a groove. I need to play some games and
practice some. Usually, everything seems slow on the floor. But right now
it's all happening so fast. I need things to slow down again."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Derrick Coleman of the Philadelphia 76ers was suspended for one
game without pay and fined $7,500 on Monday for throwing a punch at Karl
Malone.</LD>
<LD>   Philadelphia Coach Larry Brown, who complained about the officiating,
also was fined $7,500 by the NBA.</LD>
<LD>   Coleman will miss the 76ers' game Wednesday at Phoenix.</LD>
<TE>   The suspension and fines stemmed from Saturday's game at Utah and were
announced by NBA vice president of operations Stu Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Malone grabbed a rebound near Philadelphia's basket with 6:41
remaining in the third quarter and got tangled with Coleman. Malone threw
an elbow and the two bumped. The play was ruled a double technical until
Coleman punched Malone in the arm. Coleman immediately was whistled for
another technical and thrown out.</TE>

<TE>   Memphis center Bryant Reeves will miss the rest of the season because
of chronic back pain.</TE>
<TE>   Reeves, the franchise's career leader in games played, has
degenerative discs and has not played during the regular season. He
appeared briefly during the exhibition season.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA has awarded Memphis a $4.5-million injury exception, or salary
cap cushion. That means the Grizzlies can sign a player or accept a
package in which salaries do not exceed that amount.</TE>

<HD>Jackson Turns Mysterious</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phil Jackson's New Year's resolution, offered with a puckish grin
Sunday night, is "to surrender."</LD>
<LD>   He almost certainly will receive telephone calls today from Rick
Adelman and Gregg Popovich, each eager to draw the terms.</LD>
<LD>   That's probably not what he meant, but only his Zen master and Tex
Winter know for sure.</LD>
<TE>   But it reminded all that the Laker year would end as it started, en
route to something big, or so they think, and with a championship already
behind them.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers won 70 games and lost 23 in 2001, including 15 of 16 in the
most dominating postseason the league had seen. They concluded the last
regular season 34-16 and began this one 21-6.</TE>
<TE>   In between, they won another NBA title, resolved the feud that picked
at their morale, and Shaquille O'Neal was borne a child that he did not
name "Sha-Kobe," as he had playfully threatened.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant married, made a friend in O'Neal, and found a game he
could love, as could everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers passed through crises of O'Neal and Jackson, of Bryant and
Jackson, of Isaiah Rider and Jackson, and of Rider and Rider.</TE>
<TE>   They went another year without losing three in a row, remarkably. It
was avoided again two nights ago, in the final game of 2001, with a
24-point defeat of the Houston Rockets.</TE>
<TE>   "We ended the year of 2001 on a good note," Rick Fox said, "so that
will start the next year on the right foot for us."</TE>
<TE>   The early part of the year bodes well in terms of personnel, if not
schedule. O'Neal is expected to return from the agony of two sore toes by
Friday, when the Lakers play the Phoenix Suns. Legendary broadcaster
Chick Hearn, recovering from open-heart surgery, could be back a month
later. The team is 2-2 without O'Neal, 3-3 without Hearn, and 1-0 when
Cuttino Mobley bites Bryant near the neck, which he did in Houston 12
days ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers open 2002 on the road, where they'll spend 13 of their next
18 games. They will play nine home games in January and February
combined, which made their 7-5 December fairly regrettable for them,
though hardly disastrous.</TE>
<TE>   On one of those long trips, Jackson will have reached the halfway
point of his five-year contract with owner Jerry Buss. He hasn't
surrendered yet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fox is a man of the big picture, and we're not talking "The
Collectors" here, though he was the biggest thing in that picture.</TE>
<TE>   So when the Lakers beat the Rockets, who had no business being on an
NBA floor Sunday night, it was Fox who pushed the perspective.</TE>
<TE>   After a long, ugly shooting slump, Laker jumpers fell, and Laker
shooters swooned. And while everyone purred over the rhythm of the
offense, the perimeter looked no more open than it had been for the
previous three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We've talked about how you overemphasize the fact that you're in a
shooting slump," said Fox, whose three three-pointers were his first in
five games. "It's like having a sore thumb. The thumb just grows and you
can't take your mind off it. But you just try to relax and you'll
eventually break out of it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In their last 10 games, the Lakers have 90 fewer free-throw attempts
than their opponents. In four games without O'Neal, they have 53 fewer
attempts.... In setting the franchise record with three turnovers against
Houston, the Lakers had one in the first quarter, none in the second or
third, and two in the fourth, when not a single starter played.... Samaki
Walker has 14 blocked shots in his last three games. "We have to have
some type of presence there," he said.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kenyon Martin made a big mistake when he mentioned his back spasms
to Michael Jordan.</LD>
<LD>   On learning this news, Jordan went to work and nearly set an NBA
record. He scored 22 points in a row, part of a 45-point game in the
Washington Wizards' 98-76 victory over the New Jersey Nets on Monday
night in the MCI Center's annual New Year's Eve game.</LD>
<LD>   "Kenyon Martin told me he had a back problem," Jordan said. "I don't
think he wants to tell me that. I just started attacking from that point
on."</LD>
<TE>   Coming off a 51-point game and a six-pointer before that, Jordan made
16 of 32 shots and 12 of 13 free throws with 10 rebounds and seven
assists. He scored the last 10 points of the first half and the first 12
of the third quarter, single-handedly accounting for a 19-3 run that put
Washington ahead 56-45. The Nets never got closer than nine.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael's feeling better," Washington Coach Doug Collins said. "I
guess that's an understatement, huh?"</TE>
<TE>   The 22-point streak was one shy of the league record, set by Jordan
when he had 23 in a row for Chicago against Atlanta on April 16, 1987.
Jordan scored 61 in that game.</TE>
<TE>   The Wizards have won 11 of their last 13 and went 11-4 for the month,
tying the team record for most wins in December. They went 2-13 last
December, the worst in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   "My knees are feeling good," Jordan said. "I'm feeling a lot better.
Once I get in a rhythm, I can get it going, so I think that'll keep all
those old-player conversations down a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miami 89, Indiana 87--Alonzo Mourning made a hook shot with 47.2
seconds left, and Eddie Jones scored 29 points to lead the Heat over the
Pacers at Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Mourning, who finished with 19 points, scored over Jermaine O'Neal to
snap the Heat's six-game losing streak and improve their record to 6-23.</TE>
<TE>   Miami, which trailed by five points with less than five minutes
remaining, used a 15-9 run to clinch its first victory since Dec. 15.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 90, Milwaukee 83--Ron Mercer scored 20 points, and Marcus
Fizer had 17 points and a career-high 14 rebounds at Chicago as the Bulls
improved to 2-0 under Coach Bill Cartwright.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Cassell scored 28 to lead the Bucks, who were without leading
scorers Ray Allen and Glenn Robinson because of injuries.</TE>

<HD>Olympics Could Create Problems for Red Wings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since the start of the season, Detroit has been the class of the
league, having racked up a whopping 61 points. Coaches such as
Minnesota's Jacques Lemaire don't see the star-studded Red Wings losing a
playoff series.</LD>
<LD>   But before the Red Wings start planning to parade the Stanley Cup
around, they'd better remember that they're going to have to do it the
hard way.</LD>
<LD>   Detroit will have a league-high 10 players at next month's Salt Lake
City Olympics and any of those Olympians could be hurt. Even if the Red
Wings come through the Olympics unscathed, their team will be anything
but fresh for the playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   "We've played over 40 games already and we're just starting the new
year," said New York Ranger winger Theo Fleury, who will represent Canada
at Utah. "Because of the Olympics, everything is compact, which makes our
schedule a lot tougher."</TE>
<TE>   Before the 1998 Olympic Games in Nagano, hockey experts were choosing
the Colorado Avalanche as the favorites to win the Cup. But when standout
center Joe Sakic suffered a knee injury playing for Canada in Japan, then
played hurt the rest of the season, Colorado lost its edge and watched
Detroit take home the Cup.</TE>
<TE>   That could happen this season to the Red Wings, whose Olympians are
among the oldest players. By playoff time, six of Detroit's Olympians
will be 36 or older.</TE>
<TE>   Playing in the Western Conference will also work against Detroit.
Olympians who play for NHL teams in the Eastern Conference have easier
travel because of the proximity of the teams. The Red Wings will not
catch that break.</TE>
<TE>   Fleury, who played most of his career with the Calgary Flames, is glad
he's playing with an East Coast team.</TE>
<TE>   "The travel on the East is way better," he said. "It is so much easier
on you. When I played in Calgary, it was unbelievable. We had very few
charter flights [and] a lot of time, we had to fly commercial. It was
tough. It took a lot out of you. It can definitely catch up with you at
playoff time."</TE>
<TE>HOLIDAY JEER</TE>
<TE>   Florida Coach Mike Keenan and Chicago forward Tony Amonte have been
exchanging unpleasantries since Keenan took over the Panthers.</TE>
<TE>   Amonte, who played for Keenan when both were with the Rangers, said
when asked to compare Keenan to Chicago Coach Brian Sutter, "Mike Keenan
couldn't hold this guy's jock strap. Keenan never coached. Keenan never
coached the power play. Keenan never coached penalty killing. He never
had a system. He tried to motivate by intimidation. Brian is the most
prepared coach I've ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   Keenan responded, "First of all, Tony is an excellent player, but some
of his comments are inappropriate for a professional athlete at this
point. He was a young boy when he was traded [by the Rangers to Chicago]
and he's still upset.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, that's part of the game. [The Rangers] won the Stanley Cup [in
1994] probably because of the players we traded him for [Stephane Matteau
and Brian Noonan].</TE>
<TE>   "He'll understand that some day, when he's in that position. We needed
those components that he could bring at that time.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometime you only have one chance in 54 years to win the Cup and
you've got to take advantage of it."</TE>
<TE>LINE SHIFTS</TE>
<TE>   * New York's Eric Lindros will be watched even closer, now that he has
suffered his first head injury of the season. Although Lindros said he
felt only a little off after leaving a game against San Jose in the first
period on Friday, expect the Rangers to be cautious with him for the next
week. New York has six more games to reach 50 for the season and that's
when Lindros is to collect the first $6 million of his
performance-clause-laden contract, provided he's been "concussion free."
The Rangers have not determined Lindros' recent injury to be a
concussion.</TE>
<TE>   * Pittsburgh's Mario Lemieux, who has been sidelined because of a hip
injury, plans to return to the Penguin lineup within the next two weeks
after skating pain-free last week. He rejoined practice Monday, his first
official workout with the team since Nov. 12.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not holding back right now," he told the Pittsburgh Post Gazette.
"I'm skating the way I used to in the past. [It's] just going to take
time. The best way to get back in shape is to play games. The sooner the
better, obviously."</TE>
<TE>   * You have to love Dallas Coach Ken Hitchcock's straightforwardness.
Guess which Dallas Star he was talking about when he recently said, "If
you want to be an elite team and stay there, it's all about the
goaltenders." Yes, it was Dallas goalie Eddie Belfour, whose
goals-against average has gone from 2.34 last season to 2.66 this season.
"If Eddie can play the way he did the last two years, that will give us a
fighting chance," Hitchcock said.</TE>
<TE>   * Despite having the league's second-best record, Chicago still is
looking for some respect. The Blackhawks have given up a ton of goals and
critics have questioned their defense and penalty killing.</TE>
<TE>   "You can read what you want into those figures," said the outspoken
Sutter. "I love to hear people say that we're not good defensively. We're
very good defensively. We're a darn good team, five on five, and our
penalty killing has made very important steps lately."</TE>
<TE>   * The San Jose Sharks must have listened to former King Coach and ESPN
personality Barry Melrose, and got big heads over the Christmas break.
After the Sharks had opened the season with an 18-8-6-3 record, Melrose
said they were the best team in the league. Since then, San Jose has lost
three consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   * Chicago right wing Steve Thomas will be out for at least 12 weeks
after breaking his left ankle for the second time this season, Buffalo
forward Slava Kozlov will miss two months with a torn Achilles' tendon.</TE>
<TE>   * Colorado can only hope that the latest reports out of Sweden
regarding six-time all-star center Peter Forsberg are true. According to
the Denver Post, Forsberg plans to return to the Avalanche after playing
for his country in the Olympics.</TE>

<LD>For the Kings, home is where the heartache is.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Andy Murray's Kings are 7-8-4-1 on the road, which ranks near
the middle of the pack among the NHL's 30 teams, but they are only
7-8-3-1 in Staples Center, which ranks among the league's worst home
records.</LD>
<LD>   Last season, en route to their second consecutive 90-point campaign,
the Kings were 20-12-8-1 in Staples Center, 18-16-5-2 on the road.</LD>
<TE>   "We've been pretty good on the road this year," Murray said Monday.
"It's really our home record that's let us down. If we're sitting here at
home now five or six games above .500, things look a lot different....</TE>
<TE>   "It's one thing to say you play hard and you battle, but we've got to
get points and we haven't been as dominant at home as we should be. I
don't know if there's anything concrete that we could say is a problem.
You can look at reasons and talk about long road trips and coming back
[tired], but that's just sugarcoating it. We just haven't played good."</TE>
<TE>   Only the Mighty Ducks, Columbus Blue Jackets, Florida Panthers and
Atlanta Thrashers have been worse in front of their hometown fans.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Murray said that Ziggy Palffy and Mathieu Schneider could return to
the lineup for Wednesday night's home-stand finale against the Panthers.
Schneider, however, described himself as doubtful after participating in
his first full practice since mid-November. Palffy said that he will
play.... When Randy Robitaille was activated from the injured list
Saturday, Steve Kelly was reassigned to the Kings' American Hockey League
team at Manchester, N.H. Barring other injuries, two more players will be
shipped out once Palffy and Schneider are activated.</TE>

<HD>December Ends on Bitter Note</HD>

<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio
</DL>
<LD>This was how one of the most successful months in Mighty Duck
history ended: Not with a bang, but a whimper.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks, who had 17 points through the first two months, picked up
17 more in December with a 6-5-2-3 record. But they ended the month with
consecutive losses to Chicago and Columbus in games that were scoreless
after two periods.</LD>
<LD>   "The only disappointing thing is this game tonight," Coach Bryan
Murray said after a 3-1 loss to Columbus on Monday. "Where we played so
well so early, we didn't get any reward. If you don't get paid at the end
of the month, you're not as happy."</LD>
<TE>   The Ducks' success in December can be attributed to their goalies,
Jean-Sebastien Giguere and Steve Shields. Giguere gave up only 13 goals
in 10 games during the month, yet had only a 4-4-2 record to show for it.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' woes can be traced to their offense, which has scored more
than two goals only 12 times.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are playing hard," Murray said. "We've looked after the
defense zone pretty well.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the first stages of getting the franchise and the team turned
around a little bit. The next step now is to score some goals and win
some games on a more consistent basis."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Columbus was 3-10-1 in its last 14 games. The Blue Jackets have only
six victories since Nov. 16, but three have come against the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, they play very well against us," Matt Cullen said. "They
come into the game with good thoughts in their heads.</TE>
<TE>   "We come into the game knowing they have had a lot of success against
us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duck defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski sat out a third consecutive game
with a sprained left ankle.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Can't Catch a Break in 3-1 Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio
</DL>
<LD>Jeff Friesen plopped down next to the goal post Monday, like a
bewildered child. Matt Cullen leaned on the crossbar, not believing this
was happening to the Mighty Ducks.</LD>
<LD>   Moments before, the puck danced tantalizingly close to the goal line,
but would not go in. Columbus goalie Ron Tugnutt made one save on a shot,
then caught a break when the rebound went off a skate and hit the post.
No goal.</LD>
<LD>   It was only the second period. There was no score. But the Ducks were
headed south again.</LD>
<TE>   Columbus' 3-1 victory in front of 18,136 at the Nationwide Arena was a
bit repetitive. The Blue Jackets' are 6-0-0-1 in two seasons against the
Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' loss was pretty much a rerun. They got bushels of chances
and no goals, until Oleg Tverdovsky belted home a power-play shot with
1:34 left. Too little, too late.</TE>
<TE>   For the second consecutive game, the Ducks took a scoreless tie into
the third period, then gave up two goals. They lost to Chicago, 2-1,
Sunday. About all that changed Monday was the opponents' uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   Columbus' Ray Whitney scored after the puck ricocheted, then bounced a
couple of times, to break the scoreless tie. Grant Marshall tried to
center a pass, only to have the puck hit Pavel Trnka's skate and go in
the net for a 2-0 lead. The Ducks never recovered.</TE>
<TE>   "Give us one of those," Cullen said. "It's there enough, just give us
a break. One bounce is all we need. That's the frustrating thing, because
we're doing enough things to win."</TE>
<TE>   More than enough.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks had 15 first-period shots, all quality chances. Tugnutt
denied them. He stopped 27 of 28 shots with a handful of brilliant saves.
The Ducks carried that play into the second period. The kind bounce
wasn't there.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like it could have been 3-0 at the end of the first
period," Coach Bryan Murray said. "Ron made a couple really big stops. We
put the puck into him a couple times when he was out of position. That's
the way it's been lately. We make every goaltender the first star of the
game."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks have scored no more than two goals in 30 of 42 games,
leaving their goalies and defense with little margin for error.</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Sebastien Giguere continued his spectacular play in December,
stopping 32 of 34 shots.</TE>
<TE>   "I can certainly never complain about that area," Murray said. "The
disappointing part is they have to pitch a shutout almost for us to win."</TE>
<TE>   If there was one team in the NHL the Ducks figured to be better than
offensively it was Columbus.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jackets had 69 goals before Monday, the fewest in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   Their power play ranked only above that of the Pittsburgh Penguins.
Yet, the Blue Jackets were the ones celebrating goals in the third
period.</TE>
<TE>   First, Brett Harkins corralled a bouncing puck and managed a cross-ice
pass to Whitney, leaving Giguere out of position.</TE>
<TE>   Whitney slipped the shot between the legs of center Marc Chouinard,
who tried to cover the net, for a 1-0 lead 6:11 into the third period.</TE>
<TE>   It ended a streak of 30 consecutive penalties that the Ducks had
killed.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jackets took a 2-0 lead less than two minutes later with the
type of break that has killed the Ducks many times this season.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall was knocked down in the corner and, when he got up, found the
puck at his feet. He centered a pass and got a deflection.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Dineen scored an empty-net goal with 19 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough to keep your head," Cullen said. "It's tough not to say,
'This is one of those nights again.' That's kind of been the story the
last few games."</TE>

<DL>SAN JOSE
</DL>
<LD>The Silicon Valley Classic between Michigan State and Fresno State
on Monday was expected to produce some big numbers starting with the
score.</LD>
<LD>   It did, indeed.</LD>
<LD>   Michigan State won, 44-35, before a near-sellout of 30,456 at cozy
Spartan Stadium, home of the San Jose State Spartans.</LD>
<TE>   On this day, the stadium belonged to the Michigan State Spartans,
particularly their offense.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great game with a lot of big plays," Fresno State Coach Pat
Hill said. "Michigan State just had more big plays."</TE>
<TE>   The two teams combined for 753 yards--in the first half. They finished
with a combined 1,146 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Fresno State quarterback David Carr had 531 yards passing and his
favorite receiver, Rodney Wright, caught 13 passes for 299 yards and two
touchdowns. Wright's receiving yards set a school record.</TE>
<TE>   Carr finished his Fresno State career with 70 touchdown passes,
another school record.</TE>
<TE>   The Michigan State quarterback was smokin' too. Sophomore Jeff Smoker
completed 22 of 32 passes for 376 yards and three touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "We made the big plays, and that's what you have to do in a big game,"
Smoker said.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State receiver Charles Rogers caught 10 passes for a
school-record 270 yards and two touchdowns, and was selected the most
valuable player on offense. They selected an MVP on defense too, believe
it or not. It was Michigan State end Nick Myers.</TE>
<TE>   Carr completed 35 of 56 passes, with four going for touchdowns. He had
five touchdown passes in last year's Silicon Valley Classic, which Fresno
lost, 37-34, to Air Force.</TE>
<TE>   He completed passes to nine receivers Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a shame someone had to lose this game," Carr said.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't really decided until Smoker threw a five-yard touchdown pass
to backup tight end Ivory McCoy with 1:59 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State led, 37-21, at halftime, and Fresno State pulled within
37-35 before that touchdown pass to McCoy.</TE>
<TE>   After that, the large red-clad Fresno contingent that made the
three-hour drive to San Jose believed the Bulldogs still had a chance.</TE>
<TE>   But an interception and 23-yard return by freshman cornerback Roderick
Maples sealed it.</TE>
<TE>   Fresno State (11-3) took a short opening kickoff and went 63 yards in
four plays to take a 7-0 lead on a pass play to tight end Stephen Spach
less than a minute into the game.</TE>
<TE>   Fresno State had three false starts in its next possession. The third
one ended a drive at midfield.</TE>
<TE>   The Spartans (7-5) had four big plays in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   The first was a 72-yard touchdown pass play to Rogers one play after
Fresno State missed a field-goal try.</TE>
<TE>   The second came when Carr fumbled on the Bulldog six, the ball was
kicked into the end zone and Michigan State's Monquiz Wedlow fell on it
for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Another came on a fourth and one at the Michigan State 39. Instead of
going up the middle, T.J. Duckett went around the left side to score and
give the Spartans a 24-14 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The other big play was 69-yard touchdown pass to Rogers that made the
score, 37-21, at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State scored only one touchdown in the second half, but that
was all the Spartans needed.</TE>
<TE>   The difference may have been Duckett. He finished with 184 yards and
two touchdowns in 27 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Fresno State's leading rusher was Paris Gaines with 28 yards in 10
carries.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State outgained Fresno State on the ground, 227 yards to 29.</TE>
<TE>   It was Fresno State's third consecutive bowl loss. Besides losing to
Air Force last year, the Bulldogs lost to Utah, 17-16, in the 1999 Las
Vegas Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   But Hill remained upbeat Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I told our players that the game may be a small blemish, but it
doesn't tarnish at all the season they had," Hill said. "This was a
big-time football game, with a big-time atmosphere, with two very good
teams."</TE>

<LD>Washington State's defense shut down Purdue in time for Jason
Gesser to rally the Cougars to a Sun Bowl victory.</LD>
<LD>   Gesser passed for 281 yards and ran for a touchdown Monday to help No.
13 Washington State defeat Purdue, 33-27.</LD>
<LD>   Washington State (10-2) trailed, 20-17, at halftime, but the Cougars
held Purdue scoreless in the second half until the final two minutes.</LD>
<TE>   "Our coaching staff made some great adjustments in the second half
after we struggled early," Cougar Coach Mike Price said. "This is one of
the most satisfying coaching experiences I've ever had. With all the
injuries we've had this year, this win is really sweet."</TE>
<TE>   Purdue (6-6) drew to 33-27 with 1:53 left and recovered the ensuing
onside kick. The Boilermakers drove to the Washington State 22 before
turning the ball over on downs.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Dunning made all four of his field-goal attempts and Nakoa
McElrath caught five passes for 116 yards as the Cougars won their first
bowl game in seven years.</TE>
<TE>   "My timing was off in the first half, but after we went to the shotgun
in the second half, it gave me more of a chance to get my timing down,"
Gesser said. "We knew what we had to do, but they were blitzing us and
took us out of our rhythm."</TE>
<TE>   Purdue freshman Kyle Orton was 38 of 74 for 419 yards passing and two
touchdowns, all Sun Bowl records, but was intercepted four times.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't execute well, and dropped too many balls," Purdue Coach Joe
Tiller said. "When you have a young quarterback and things start to get
out of synch, they tend to stay that way."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor Stubblefield caught nine passes for 196 yards, a Sun Bowl
record, and two touchdowns. John Standeford and Tim Stratton each had 12
receptions, sharing a new Sun Bowl record. Stratton has 212 career
receptions.</TE>
<TE>   Dunning's 15 points and four field goals both tied Sun Bowl records.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars' last bowl victory came in 1994, when they beat Baylor,
10-3, in the Alamo Bowl.</TE>

<LD>Ron Turner is no stick in the mud. He gave his Illinois football
players a day off from practice last week, so they could take a bayou
tour.</LD>
<LD>   "We had no intention of practicing [every day]," said Turner, who has
coached at Illinois since 1997 and whose team will play No. 12 LSU today
in the Sugar Bowl. "They had never seen a swamp or a gator before."</LD>
<LD>   No, but they had seen rock bottom. Who could have guessed the Big Ten
champions would be 10-1 and ranked seventh in the polls? In Turner's
previous four seasons at the school, his teams finished 0-11, 3-8, 8-4
and 5-6, and no better than sixth in conference play.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously, we struggled when I first got there," said Turner, a
younger brother of longtime NFL coach Norv Turner. "I could see progress
being made the first year or two. I felt all along we were headed in the
right direction."</TE>
<TE>   And LSU? That's a bit of a surprise too. The Tigers (9-3), who won the
Southeastern Conference title with a 31-20 victory over then-No. 2
Tennessee, are making their first Sugar Bowl appearance in 14 years.
Their bowl chances looked bleak when they were 2-2, then 4-3, but a
five-game win streak made up for that bumpy start.</TE>
<TE>   "By midseason, everyone was counting us out and saying, 'LSU can't get
it done,"' safety Ryan Clark said. "But we were messing with the lineup
early on, starting new guys every week. Now, we've got a good crew on the
field, and we've gotten better as the season's gone on."</TE>
<TE>   The LSU players to watch are senior quarterback Rohan Davey and junior
Josh Reed, winner of the Fred Biletnikoff Award, given to the nation's
best receiver.</TE>
<TE>   Davey, an oft-injured backup before this season, has thrown for more
than 300 yards six times in his career--five this season--double the
number of any other quarterback in school history. He set school season
records in completions with 217 and yards passing with 3,347.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, any quarterback would love passing to Reed, the first LSU
receiver to be named to the Associated Press All-American team in 62
years. He led the nation in yards receiving with 1,740 and ranked third
in catches per game (7.8).</TE>
<TE>   "I've been coaching for about 26 years, and Josh Reed is probably as
good a receiver [as I've seen]," said Mike Cassity, Illinois' defensive
coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Reserves have also come through for LSU. Backup quarterback Mike Mauck
filled in for an injured Davey in the SEC championship game and rushed
for two touchdowns. Also in that game, Domanick Davis replaced
all-conference tailback LaBrandon Toefield--who'd suffered a
season-ending knee injury in the first half--and rushed for 78 yards and
the final touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the Illini are loaded with offensive talent. Their
seven-game winning streak is second this season to Miami's 11, and they
have averaged 32.4 points a game. Big-play receivers Brandon Lloyd and
Walter Young should put a vulnerable Tiger secondary to the test.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois quarterback Kurt Kittner has thrown for 2,994 yards and 23
touchdowns this season. He led the Big Ten in passing offense and ranked
second in total offense.</TE>
<TE>   Four times this season, Kittner helped his team overcome
fourth-quarter deficits, quite in contrast to last season, when Illinois
blew four fourth-quarter leads.</TE>
<TE>   "This team came in with an attitude that it was not going to be
denied," Turner said. "When we fell behind in the fourth quarter of
games, there wasn't any panic."</TE>

<HD>Louisville Shuts Down BYU</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Louisville Cardinals thought they would have to use offense to
defeat Brigham Young. The defense made that plan unnecessary.</LD>
<LD>   Dave Ragone threw for 228 yards and three touchdowns, and the defense
came up with five sacks and three interceptions as No. 23 Louisville beat
No. 19 Brigham Young, 28-10, Monday in the Liberty Bowl at Memphis, Tenn.</LD>
<LD>   Ragone described the defensive play as unbelievable.</LD>
<TE>   "They shut down one of the best offenses I've ever seen," he said of
the Cougars, who have the nation's top unit.</TE>
<TE>   For BYU (12-2), the loss marked yet another disappointing end to a
season that held the promise of being an undefeated one only a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars lost their third consecutive bowl game and 10th in their
last 14 despite an offense that averaged 542.8 yards and set a school
record by averaging 46.7 points. But All-American running back Luke
Staley, the nation's leading scorer, was out because of ankle surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Louisville kept the Cougars from finding a rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   The defense held BYU quarterback Brandon Doman to 18-of-37 passing for
192 yards. The defense repeatedly gave the Louisville offense a short
field, and three of the Cardinal touchdown drives were 54 yards or
shorter.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Bobby Leffew and his teammates hoped they could keep
the Cougars to 25 points. They wound up limiting BYU to its lowest point
total of the season and a season-low 276 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Ragone, Conference USA's offensive player of the year, tossed
touchdown passes of one, 34 and 27 yards. He was 19 of 28, and Deion
Branch had six catches for 88 yards and a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Clemson 49, Louisiana Tech 24--Woodrow Dantzler tied a school record
with four touchdown passes and Tiger Coach Tommy Bowden got his first
postseason victory in the Humanitarian Bowl at Boise, Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   With snow falling from kickoff into the third quarter, Dantzler
completed 15 of 23 passes for 218 yards. He ran 15 times for 57 yards
before leaving with the Tigers (7-5) leading, 42-10, after the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs (7-5), champions of the Western Athletic Conference in
their first season in the league, tackled poorly in the cold weather and
quarterback Luke McCown's two third-quarter interceptions led to two
Clemson touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina 16, Auburn 10--The Tar Heels (8-5) dominated on
defense, and Ronald Curry provided just enough offense to defeat the
Tigers (7-5) in the Peach Bowl in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Curry scrambled for a 62-yard touchdown and the Tar Heels kept Auburn
out of the end zone for nearly 59 minutes, holding on for a victory that
capped a successful first year for Coach John Bunting.</TE>

<HD>It's Rocky Mountain High for Barnett</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.
</DL>
<LD>Gary Barnett wasn't a candidate for the Notre Dame coaching job. He
is not being courted to replace Mike Riley as the San Diego Charger
coach. Barnett isn't the hot, young, quick-fix, charismatic,
get-him-on-the-phone-now prospect on the speed dial of every college
athletic director who even mused about hiring a coach.</LD>
<LD>   Barnett is 55. His reputation was smudged a bit when he bailed out of
Northwestern only three years into a 12-year contract and only days after
e-mailing his players that he would \o7 not \f7 be taking the Colorado
job two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   But then Gary Kubiak changed his mind after accepting the Colorado
job. And, honestly, Barnett said, Colorado was the job of his dreams. It
wasn't the Notre Dame job that had been dangled before him. It wasn't the
Texas job that he had practically been forced to interview for. It wasn't
any of the NFL jobs, the ones where general managers had just about
kidnapped him so they could talk to him.</LD>
<TE>   Colorado was where Barnett's heart was. It was where he had been a
happy assistant to Bill McCartney. It had mountains and it had his soul.
And if you don't believe him, if you were a Northwestern player who felt
betrayed or a Northwestern president who felt used, then Barnett will
politely say that he prefers to remember all the good things about being
at Northwestern and will point to all the people who do understand that
in this world, in this profession, as a coach, it is wise to always try
and better your position.</TE>
<TE>   As Colorado is poised to play Oregon today in the Fiesta Bowl, Barnett
has bettered his position. The 10-2 Buffaloes have a small chance of
claiming a share of a national championship. Barnett has moved the
Buffaloes smartly away from the misery of a 3-8 season a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   He ignored the mutterings of Colorado faithful as they wondered
whether it had been worth stealing Barnett from Northwestern. Barnett
stayed quiet when his team lost its opener to Fresno State. It was a
loss, having come immediately after the 3-8 disaster, that seemed to
signal a continuing downward spiral. If not a moment of triumph, at least
it wasn't evidence of disintegration. Fresno State, we discovered, wasn't
so bad. Neither were the Buffaloes.</TE>
<TE>   "People were writing us off and writing off Coach Barnett," senior
guard Andre Gurode, a co-captain, said. "I know there were doubters after
Fresno State. But I think it's a credit to Coach Barnett that the team
didn't doubt. There was nobody on this team who didn't understand where
we were heading."</TE>
<TE>   What Barnett brought to Colorado, Gurode said, was a sense of purpose,
discipline, hard-headedness and toughness.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett had replaced another defector, Rick Neuheisel. Neuheisel had
been stolen from Colorado by Washington. Neuheisel had taken his players
on camping trips and inner-tubing expeditions. Neuheisel had played
guitar and sung songs to his players.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Barnett was a lot different," Gurode said. "He expected us to
sit up straight in meetings. Coach Neuheisel was more like one of the
guys. Coach Barnett, he didn't seem like the kind of man you approached
real easily. But he understands what it takes to make a good football
team. I think everybody here knew how hard it had been for him to do what
he did at Northwestern. I think we all figured if he could win at
Northwestern, he could win here."</TE>
<TE>   What Barnett had done at Northwestern is legend, the taking of the
Wildcats to a place of fairy-tale dreams, the Rose Bowl game. It had been
said that men would land on the moon before Northwestern would go to the
Rose Bowl. And they did. So it was said that men would walk on Mars
before Northwestern would go to the Rose Bowl. But they didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Of course the man who engineered this miracle would be a popular
choice for other jobs. If it seemed wrong, somehow, for Barnett to have
been interviewing for other jobs every day--and that is how it seemed to
the people at Northwestern--Barnett stands by his behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't go after any of those jobs," Barnett said. "I was contacted.
And I listened. I always said I would listen to chances to better myself
and my family.</TE>
<TE>   "When I left Northwestern there was kind of a generational split. The
older players, the upperclassmen, understood what I was doing. The
younger ones didn't at the time."</TE>
<TE>   The toughness Barnett showed his players, he shows everyone. Practices
are closed to the media. Barnett has a legendary hatred of the Internet
and all the gossip it encourages. According to the Denver Post, Barnett
publicly challenged two alums, accusing them of disseminating untrue
rumors in a Colorado chat room during a weekly fan luncheon. The Colorado
sports information director had his pay withheld for a month for speaking
to the media about a dispute between the running backs coach and a
tailback.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett's methods work. That is indisputable. If Nebraska beats Miami
in the Rose Bowl on Thursday, it is possible that Colorado, should it
beat Oregon, could own part of a national championship. Barnett has
consistently, quietly but emphatically kept pointing to Colorado's
26-point victory over Nebraska last month.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got up this morning," Barnett said, "the importance of what
will happen in the next 36 hours really struck me. I've got butterflies
and I usually don't get butterflies until two hours before kickoff."</TE>
<TE>   The enormousness of being so close to a national title, even a little
piece of one, has made Barnett nervous. This is a change. Barnett admits
it. Even when Barnett brought Northwestern to its magical Rose Bowl, he
acted as if it were no big deal. As if it were expected. Just like all
those phone calls from all those athletic directors. No big deal. Things
truly are different.</TE>

<HD>They're Feeling a Sense of Entitlement</HD>
<DH>Fiesta Bowl: Left out of BCS equation, Colorado or Oregon could
claim piece of national championship with a win today and a Miami loss
Thursday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.
</DL>
<LD>In this winter of discontent, it seems only fitting the two teams
snubbed by the bowl championship series get to play for their own version
of the national title.</LD>
<LD>   Call it the People's Choice Awards of college football. Or the team
that would be king.</LD>
<LD>   Oregon and Colorado meet in the Fiesta Bowl today ranked second and
third in the polls, knowing they have a chance to throw a wrench into the
complicated BCS machinery that sent fourth-ranked Nebraska to the title
game at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   They know that if the Cornhuskers upset No. 1 Miami on Thursday,
thereby taking the BCS title, the winner of today's game might be voted
champion in the Associated Press poll. And that would be "awesome," in
the words of Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti, who has made no secret of his
feelings.</TE>
<TE>   Only a couple of weeks ago, Bellotti was calling the BCS a "travesty"
and "a bad disease, like cancer." He has cooled a bit since then, but his
feelings have not changed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not something you overcome," he said, adding, "we're excited
about the opportunity of a possible split national championship."</TE>
<TE>   Though not quite as angry, Colorado Coach Gary Barnett has been no
less direct.</TE>
<TE>   "This feels like a national championship game," he said Monday.
"Everything about it feels that way."</TE>
<TE>   The Buffaloes (10-2) had a rough start this fall, stumbling in their
opener against Fresno State and subsequently losing to Texas.</TE>
<TE>   They reached this game by doing what teams are supposed to do,
improving each week, peaking at the end of the regular season. That
included a 62-36 stomping of Nebraska on national television and a
revenge victory over Texas in the Big 12 championship game.</TE>
<TE>   The impressive finish pushed them up the AP and USA Today/ESPN polls,
but left them 0.05 points behind Nebraska in the jumble of polls,
computer rankings and other calculations that constitute the BCS
rankings.</TE>
<TE>   "We beat Nebraska," strong safety Michael Lewis said. "I'll leave it
at that."</TE>
<TE>   Oregon (10-1) staked its claim by winning the Pacific 10, arguably the
toughest conference in the nation. Yet the quality that distinguished the
Ducks this season--quarterback Joey Harrington's late-game heroics--also
was their Achilles' heel. They barely escaped against Wisconsin (5-7),
USC (6-6), UCLA (7-4) and Oregon State (5-6). At midseason, the Ducks
squandered a big lead and lost to Stanford on two blocked punts in the
fourth quarter. And in the BCS ratings--which factor in margin of
victory--they did not have enough to recover.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a matchup of teams feeling jilted. Also a game that
promises to be highly entertaining.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon has surrounded Harrington, who finished fourth in the Heisman
Trophy balloting, with a strong supporting cast. Tailbacks Onterrio Smith
and Maurice Morris combined for nearly 2,000 yards rushing this season.
Keenan Howry was among the top receivers in the conference.</TE>
<TE>   All of that added up to 430 yards and 34 points a game, making Oregon
one of the most prolific teams in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "Their offense is tough to prepare for," Colorado linebacker Sean
Tufts said. "They don't have any weak spots, so you have to concentrate
on everything."</TE>
<TE>   The Buffaloes have been almost as explosive, averaging 33 points, but
their attack is predicated on one of the best lines in the nation and a
committee of tailbacks featuring Chris Brown, Bobby Purify and Cortlen
Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Expect Oregon to overplay the run. Then the onus would fall upon
senior quarterback Bobby Pesavento, who replaced an injured Craig Ochs
midway through the season and has held onto the job by completing 61% of
his passes for 1,234 yards with eight touchdowns. His main target has
been Daniel Graham, the team's leading receiver and winner of the John
Mackey Award as the nation's best tight end.</TE>
<TE>   There are other subplots here in the desert.</TE>
<TE>   There is the hint of a rivalry, the Buffaloes having won easily when
these teams met in the 1996 Cotton Bowl and 1998 Aloha Bowl. Some Oregon
players recall watching the '96 game when former Colorado coach Rick
Neuheisel called a fake punt with 1:11 left and a big lead.</TE>
<TE>   There have also been allegations that a number of unnamed Colorado
players participated in the sexual assault of a woman at an off-campus
party last month.</TE>
<TE>   But all this has taken a backseat to debates and grumbling over the
national championship picture.</TE>
<TE>   If Miami wins, finishing as the only undefeated team in major college
football, everyone falls into line. If not, the USA Today/ESPN poll,
voted on by coaches, is contractually obligated to skip over this game
and crown Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   The AP media poll, however, can go whichever way it chooses.</TE>
<TE>   "We think we have the strongest case to be playing in the Rose Bowl
but the computers didn't see it that way," Harrington said. "Now, we have
a chance here."</TE>

<DH>Unlike Many University Heads, Miami's Shalala Considers Big-Time
Athletics a Necessity, Not a Necessary Evil</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI
</DL>
<LD>The office of the president of the University of Miami is on the
second floor of an aging and colorless campus building best described as
institutional. Decorative touches are the sole responsibility of the
occupant.</LD>
<LD>   Donna Shalala, the current occupant, invites you into her office. She
shows you a seat, but first she shows you a football, autographed by the
members of the 1994 Rose Bowl championship team from Wisconsin, a
cherished symbol of the athletic program she revitalized there. She
displays an autographed baseball, courtesy of Miami's latest College
World Series champions. She excuses herself for a moment, rummages
through her closet and returns with a souvenir of the Sydney Olympics, an
autographed picture of the U.S. women's soccer team.</LD>
<LD>   "I was trying to figure out a place to put this," she says.</LD>
<TE>   She led the American delegation to Sydney, and joyfully so, as one of
her final duties during eight years as President Clinton's secretary of
health and human services. She leads the Miami delegation to the Rose
Bowl out of passion, not obligation.</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes' first fan emphasizes that she presides over a young
and ambitious research university of 14,000 students, over a law school
and a medical school--much more than an athletic department. Along an
office wall smothered with plaques, she points to citations from cell
biologists and political scientists, not just athletic boosters.</TE>
<TE>   But, whereas many university presidents and chancellors treat big-time
college sports with resigned indifference or muffled hostility, Shalala
considers athletics an integral part of campus culture and a vital link
to the surrounding community. Sports link her to her roots, as a college
tennis player and daughter of a nationally ranked tennis player.</TE>
<TE>   As the president of Hunter College in New York, two decades ago, she
stuffed herself into the mascot costume and performed--as the Hunter
Hawk--at a basketball game. When Miami hired her last spring, she slapped
a Hurricane bumper sticker on her Volkswagen beetle. On a flight with the
football team, she couldn't stop chuckling when several players declared
her pant legs were too long, then rolled them up.</TE>
<TE>   "She's got to be one of the coolest ladies I've ever seen in my life,"
Miami center Brett Romberg said.</TE>
<TE>   For the typical college president, game day is another work day: Shake
hands with prominent boosters, feed them, thank them for their fat checks
and encourage them to write more. Shalala, 60, does that too, but she
also ventures outside the VIP box to sit in the stands with students in
the first quarter, then with alumni in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   During the Hurricanes' last home game, she did an ABC interview with
Lynn Swann, permitted an ESPN reporter to accompany her as she sat in the
student section and hung out along the Miami sideline with baseball
superstar and local celebrity Alex Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a bunch of boosters moaning and groaning that we've got
a president that doesn't like sports," she says.</TE>
<TE>   If the boosters love you, the professors might not: The higher the
profile of the athletic department, the greater the risk of resentment in
the laboratories, libraries and lecture halls.</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, as the newly appointed chancellor at Wisconsin, Shalala
inherited a football team that was losing games and fans, and an athletic
department that was losing money. She vowed to stop all that losing, and
she did, but that vow did not endear her to all the professors on campus.</TE>
<TE>   Would more money for sports mean less money for books? Would the
university sell out its sterling academic reputation for a winning
football team? So what if the Badgers had not played in the Rose Bowl
since 1963?</TE>
<TE>   "There were faculty members who took a perverse sort of pride in
that," said Jim Hoyt, a journalism professor at Wisconsin and the faculty
representative to the NCAA during Shalala's tenure there. "The assumption
was that there was an inverse relationship between the quality of the
university and the quality of the athletic program.</TE>
<TE>   "She came in and, virtually from Day 1, her message was: We expect
excellence from all areas of campus; we expect the medical school to be
No. 1, why shouldn't we expect the same from our athletic department?</TE>
<TE>   "That defused a lot of the grumbling, because it's a difficult message
to argue against."</TE>
<TE>   To Shalala, sports could link the university to its community, to its
alumni, to the citizens of its state. She fondly recalls meeting
Wisconsin farmers who never set foot in Madison, never sent their
children to the university and still stopped in their fields to tune in
to Badger games.</TE>
<TE>   "Sports means something," she says. "It's about recreation, but it's
also about pride. It's about Monday morning around the water cooler."</TE>
<TE>   Even for the distinguished scholars, many of whom continued to use
their season tickets--she checked--as they protested the newfound
emphasis on sports.</TE>
<TE>   When Wisconsin hired Stu Jackson to coach its men's basketball team,
Shalala called the chairman of the psychiatry department. Jackson's wife
was a psychiatrist; did the department have any job openings? The
chairman's response, according to Shalala: Can I upgrade my basketball
seats?</TE>
<TE>   Still, in an era of million-dollar contracts for top college coaches
and billion-dollar contracts to televise the NCAA men's basketball
tournament, even supportive faculty members wonder whether the money and
temptations of big-time sports virtually guarantee the trouble that
stains the image of a university. Last June, the Knight Foundation
reported that more than half of Division I schools had been cited for
"major violations" of NCAA rules within the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't lump every program together," Shalala says. "There are a
lot of programs that have serious fundamental problems and need to be
restructured, and I think you always have to be vigilant.</TE>
<TE>   "But some of the rules of the NCAA go against common sense. It kills
me sometimes that, when there are a bunch of student-athletes sitting
there waiting for the bus, and I could give them a ride, I can't. It's
raining, and I can't give them a ride. I can't even reach out and hand
them an umbrella, probably, because that would be a gift."</TE>
<TE>   The violations have been much more severe at Wisconsin in the eight
years since Shalala left to join Clinton's cabinet, and at Miami. The men
she selected to reverse the Badgers' fortunes, Athletic Director Pat
Richter and football Coach Barry Alvarez, were reprimanded last year in
the wake of school and NCAA investigations that revealed the football and
basketball programs had provided improper housing assistance for recruits
and that hundreds of athletes on a variety of Wisconsin teams had
received thousands of dollars' worth of impermissible discounts from a
shoe store. The NCAA put Wisconsin on five years' probation.</TE>
<TE>   And there was truth in advertising when the old Notre Dame-Miami
football games were billed as "Catholics vs. Convicts." In 1995, the NCAA
stripped the Hurricanes of 24 football scholarships over two years as
partial punishment for a catalog of misdeeds that included financial-aid
fraud, hushed-up positive drug tests and payments to players as rewards
for big hits in big games. In 1994, the final season under Coach Dennis
Erickson, the Hurricanes had more players arrested, 12, than victories,
10.</TE>
<TE>   In the cases of both schools, the NCAA sanctions cited a lack of
institutional control, perhaps the most damning phrase in college sports.
In plain English, it means no one on campus is properly supervising the
athletic department.</TE>
<TE>   The violations at Wisconsin occurred after Shalala had departed, and
the violations at Miami occurred before she arrived, so she cannot
address what happened in either case, or why. But she warns that any
president or chancellor who ignores the athletic department does so at
his or her peril.</TE>
<TE>   The person running the university need not be a sports fan, she says,
but big-time sports carry supervisory responsibility too important to be
delegated.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying Miami won't have a problem in the future," she says.
"I've run a very good institution that had problems in the future. But I
do believe the president herself has to pay attention."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reform at Miami predates Shalala, with the credit shared among
Athletic Director Paul Dee, former coach Butch Davis (who replaced
Erickson) and current Coach Larry Coker, promoted from offensive
coordinator when Davis left for the NFL's Cleveland Browns. The arrest
rate is down; the graduation rate is up.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first heard about going to college as a football player, on
scholarship, I was totally thinking about getting money, getting cars,
pretty much the way this school used to operate," Romberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "I come here, and you have to have this, you have to be attentive, you
have to do everything they say. I was expecting guys to just show up for
class whenever they wanted, but you're penalized for everything wrong.
It's not a prison--actually, it really is, but it's a healthy prison
system. It's only going to benefit you."</TE>
<TE>   Rare is the Miami football recruit who does not consider himself a
lock to play in the NFL. Over the last 15 years, no school has had more
players selected in the first round of the NFL draft.</TE>
<TE>   But miss two classes without an excuse, and Coker will see you at 6
a.m., for a meeting and an extra workout.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm old enough and smart enough to know that all these guys aren't
going to make $47 million in the National Football League, like Edgerrin
James," Coker said. "I see too many of them that come back and say,
'Well, Coach, if only I had gone to class.... '</TE>
<TE>   "I hope all of them make it [in the NFL], but most of our players
don't. Some that do, they make it for two or three years, and then they
have to go out and get a job. We're going to do everything we can to make
sure they don't leave here without at least a great opportunity to get an
education."</TE>
<TE>   Shalala delivers that message herself, and often. She encourages
coaches hosting recruits on a campus visit to drop by her office, so she
can talk with the prospective Hurricanes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, Shalala spoke to numerous campus
and community gatherings. One of the first audiences she addressed: The
football team, at practice.</TE>
<TE>   She pulled aside one Muslim member of the team for a private chat in
Farsi, a language she'd spoken as a Peace Corps volunteer in Iran during
the Kennedy administration. Then she gathered all the players.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them that I thought the terrorists wanted to stop them from
doing everything," she says. "They wanted to stop us from going to
school. They wanted to stop us from playing football. They wanted to
destroy our culture and entertainment. And that was the reason why we
were going to continue to do what we were doing. We weren't going to let
them stop us."</TE>
<TE>   And then she talked to them about one of her favorite subjects, the
Rose Bowl. This was September, two games into the Hurricanes' season.
Coker, the typical coach, repeatedly warns his players not to look beyond
the next game. Yet here came Shalala, the big boss, telling stories about
the promised land of Pasadena. "She talks about the Rose Bowl a lot,"
cornerback Phillip Buchanon said. "She says she hasn't lost a game in the
Rose Bowl."</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin won three Rose Bowls within seven years, all under Richter
and Alvarez. Shalala had left for Washington by then, but in spirit she
had never left Madison. Her office in Miami is crowded with all kinds of
memorabilia, sporting and otherwise. But rest assured she can find room,
somewhere, for another Rose Bowl championship football.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>1. Do The Right Thing</LD>
<LD>   The events of Sept. 11 didn't render sports meaningless, but they did
force our pastimes to reevaluate their place in the big picture. There's
a time to entertain and distract, but there's also a time to step aside
and reflect. Surprisingly, our sports leaders got it right, starting with
baseball Commissioner Bud Selig's decision to immediately postpone games
after Sept. 11, followed by the NFL, which was the sign some straggling
college football conferences needed to see before agreeing to do the
same.</LD>
<LD>   2. The November Classic</LD>
<TE>   New York needed this World Series, with the Yankees in it, refusing to
fold, pulling off incredible, can-you-top-this comebacks in Games 4 and
5. Arizona won it, with Randy Johnson starting Game 6 and finishing Game
7 to complete a memorable triumph over the odds, Mariano Rivera and Fox's
virtual-ad campaigning for "Ally McBeal" and "The Tick."</TE>
<TE>   3. Slam I Am?</TE>
<TE>   What are we supposed to call Tiger Woods winning the Masters for his
fourth consecutive major? A Grand Slam, even if he didn't do it in the
same calendar year? A Sorta Slam? A Tiger Slam? How about this: Pretty
impressive.</TE>
<TE>   4. 71 ... 72 ... 73</TE>
<TE>   Even if you didn't want Barry Bonds to break the record--some might
nominate this for the Worst of 2001 list--73 home runs are 73 home runs.
You didn't have to cuddle him, but you did have to watch.</TE>
<TE>   5. Third de Lance</TE>
<TE>   Lance Armstrong wins his third consecutive Tour de France. It has
become old hat, and that might be his most impressive achievement yet.</TE>
<TE>   6. Cruising Suzuki</TE>
<TE>   He's too old and too seasoned to have been considered a rookie, but
Ichiro Suzuki was the people's choice for American League most valuable
player after batting .350 and leading the superstar-shy Seattle Mariners
to a record 116 regular-season victories.</TE>
<TE>   7. They Got Game</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers nearly swept the field en route to a 15-1 postseason and a
second consecutive NBA championship. The Sparks, led by the charismatic
all-purpose play of Lisa Leslie, won their first WNBA championship. What
next, the Clippers in the playoffs?</TE>
<TE>   8. And So Do They</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Capriati and Venus Williams divided the four women's Grand
Slam titles neatly. Capriati won the first two, the Australian and the
French, about five years after everyone presumed her career was done.
Williams took care of Wimbledon and kept the U.S. Open trophy in the
family, defeating little sister Serena in a historic final.</TE>
<TE>   9. Dale Jr. Wins at Daytona</TE>
<TE>   Four months after his father was killed on the same track, Dale
Earnhardt Jr. returned to Daytona and won the Pepsi 400.</TE>
<TE>   10. Three Jobs Well Done</TE>
<TE>   Ray Bourque went out with the Stanley Cup, finally, after 22 years of
searching the wilderness. Cal Ripken and Tony Gwynn went out together, on
non-contenders in their final season, but with a sense of style Bonds
would do well to examine.</TE>

<HD>And Worst ...</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>1. Too Little Too Late</LD>
<LD>   It took the death of a stock car racing icon, Dale Earnhardt, to scare
NASCAR drivers into wearing the protective head-and-neck restraint
device. It took the deaths of Korey Stringer, Rashidi Wheeler and more
than a dozen other football players for the sport to reexamine the use of
supplements and training camp procedures. Valuable lessons, but at far
too steep a cost.</LD>
<LD>   2. Contract This</LD>
<TE>   Days after the best World Series, and World Series ratings, in years,
Bud Selig wrings his hands and tells the nation baseball is in such dire
shape, two franchises, most likely the Minnesota Twins and the Montreal
Expos, will have to be cut before next season. A master stroke of timing
by Selig, who had America rooting for Jesse Ventura by the time the two
of them sparred before Congress, which is something when you consider ...</TE>
<TE>   3. The ExFL</TE>
<TE>   Here is where Ventura and Vince McMahon and NBC embarrassed themselves
in Saturday prime time for three obnoxious, toxic months before folding
the thing in May. On the bright side, very few people paid attention.</TE>
<TE>   4. Man Among Boys</TE>
<TE>   Bronx youngster Danny Almonte dominated the Little League World Series
like no one before him. Later it was revealed he was, in fact, an
oldster--14, too old to be eligible by two years. If the speed gun
numbers didn't tip off officials, why didn't they just look at the kid's
license?</TE>
<TE>   5. Creative Writing Irish</TE>
<TE>   George O'Leary sounded like just the man to lead Notre Dame football
back to national prominence. Then someone took another look at his
resume, did some digging and, five days later, O'Leary was forced to
resign in disgrace. The Bob Davie era never looked so good.</TE>
<TE>   6. But Colorado Scored 62</TE>
<TE>   Computers make our lives better and simpler, we are told every day.
Then the BCS put Nebraska, a 62-36 loser to Colorado in its last
regular-season game, into the national championship game against Miami.</TE>
<TE>   7. Mean Machine</TE>
<TE>   Five years after abandoning Cleveland, the Baltimore Ravens won the
Super Bowl with a surliness and a lack of grace that made the XFL look
tame by comparison. The new league never had a chance. Maybe that was
NFL's master plan all along.</TE>
<TE>   8. Or, Maybe Not   One controversial call late in a game in December
goes against the home team and Cleveland Browns Stadium goes to the
Dawgs. Which was worse: Brown fans littering the field with hundreds of
beer bottles? Or Brown owner Al Lerner and General Manager Carmen Policy
shrugging off the incident, saying fans will be fans.</TE>
<TE>   9. Parity Out of Control</TE>
<TE>   With one more loss apiece this week, the Detroit Lions and Carolina
Panthers will both finish 1-15 in the same season, a first in NFL
history.</TE>
<TE>   10. UCLLLLA</TE>
<TE>   The tease was on again, for the second time in four seasons. Then came
the DeShaun Foster debacle, followed by the Cory Paus debacle, and Bruins
plummet--from Rose Bowl to BCS bowl to no bowl at all.</TE>

<HD>This Shula Didn't Fall Far From Family Tree</HD>

<LD>Shulas are as beloved in Florida as Kennedys are in Massachusetts
and Bushes are in Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Credit the family's patriarch, Don Shula, who coached the Miami
Dolphins for 26 seasons, won two Super Bowls and whose 1972 team finished
17-0. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1997 as the
winningest coach.</LD>
<LD>   So imagine the scrutiny his grandson, Dan, endured this season playing
quarterback for St. Thomas Aquinas High at Fort Lauderdale, Fla.</LD>
<TE>   Forget whether he was a good passer. His last name raised expectations
to the stratosphere.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something you have to learn to deal with," Dan said. "I think I
have."</TE>
<TE>   Dan, a left-hander, has a 4.65 grade-point average and passed for a
school-record 316 yards in the state championship game, which his team
lost, 28-20.</TE>
<TE>   He'll share quarterback duties with the highly recruited Gavin Dickey
of Tallahassee Lincoln in the CaliFlorida Bowl on Wednesday at 2:30 p.m.
at El Camino College.</TE>
<TE>   Dan's father, David, coach of the Cincinnati Bengals from 1992 to '96,
has flown in for the game. His uncle, Mike, quarterback coach of the
Miami Dolphins, will watch on television.</TE>
<TE>   But no one's feeling more excited than grandfather Don.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very proud of him," Don said. "He's handled everything very
mature-like. He's done so well. It was a great year watching high school
football. I think I've enjoyed watching my grandkids more than anything.
You could see [Dan] growing in confidence through the year."</TE>
<TE>   Dave Wilson, coach of the Florida team, said he asked Dan about Shula
family gatherings around the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you all talk about anything but football?" he asked Dan.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, we talk about what we're going to eat," Dan said.</TE>
<TE>   From watching video of opposing teams at home with his father, to
calling his uncle for quarterback questions, Dan has plenty of experts
ready to offer help.</TE>
<TE>   He has been exposed to behind-the-scenes experiences most teenagers
can only dream about. He remembers attending Bengal practices and games,
hanging out in the locker room, seeing how players interacted and
learning the secret to football success.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot of hard work," he said. "You can't just go out there and
run up and down the field."</TE>
<TE>   Shulas don't only learn from Shulas.</TE>
<TE>   Former Dolphin quarterback Bob Griese provided Dan with invaluable
insight two years ago as they watched a game between the Denver Broncos
and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</TE>
<TE>   Griese asked how Dan's high school season was going.</TE>
<TE>   "I have seven touchdown passes and three interceptions, but the three
interceptions weren't my fault because the receivers dropped the ball,"
Dan said.</TE>
<TE>   "How many of the touchdowns were the receivers' fault?" Griese said.
"How many times did you have a five-yard pass and the receiver took it 70
yards for a touchdown?"</TE>
<TE>   Dan felt embarrassed.</TE>
<TE>   "To this day, I think about it," Dan said. "It really made me think
more about my teammates. All I do is throw the ball. They make the
plays."</TE>
<TE>   Dan, who passed for 1,893 yards and 16 touchdowns last season for his
14-1 team, has college visits set up for Dartmouth and Harvard.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to use my head and football instincts because I'm not going to
beat anybody with my physical skills," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He understands why so many people admire his grandfather as a coach,
but that's not how he views him.</TE>
<TE>   "I [think] of him as a grandfather," he said. "He showed me there's
another side of football. He loved it, but he's having fun being retired.</TE>
<TE>   "He's shown me a lot about respecting people and being honest, good
moral qualities everyone needs."</TE>
<TE>   Football has given the Shulas much joy, but also moments of despair.</TE>
<TE>   Dan said his father's firing as Bengal coach was "probably one of the
worst experiences of my life." Dan was 13 and trying to understand the
highs and lows of the coaching profession.</TE>
<TE>   "With all the losing seasons, I knew it wasn't all his fault," he
said. "The initial shock was hard to deal with."</TE>
<TE>   The family returned to Florida. David became president of Shula
Steakhouses. The only coaching he does these days is for his youngest
son's youth soccer team.</TE>
<TE>   "My family is great," Dan said. "My dad's around a lot more and
there's not as much pressure on him. He enjoys being around his three
sons."</TE>
<TE>   And what has Dan learned from being a Shula?</TE>
<TE>   "There's good times and bad times," he said. "Don't get too high
during the good times, don't get too low during the bad times.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandfather had an undefeated season. You look at other stuff
that's happened in my life and realize there's bad things as well. You
have to fight through both."</TE>

<LD>The Arrowhead Pond is a fine venue for Southern Section boys'
basketball championships--if you like an arena so quiet that you can hear
the ball leaving the referee's fingertips during tip-off.</LD>
<LD>   The Pond works well--if you desire an outside shooting display so
horrid that it's as if players are trying to put the ball through the
opening of a Coke can hoisted 10 feet above the hardwood.</LD>
<LD>   The Pond is OK--if your first priority is decent parking.</LD>
<TE>   Make no mistake, most players relish the rare opportunity to compete
in a professional arena. But they've also had to endure small crowds that
only echo inside a cavernous arena that seats about 19,000 for
basketball. Two years ago, only 14,115 attended six championship games,
an average of 2,352. The marquee Division I-A championship between Santa
Ana Mater Dei and Simi Valley drew an estimated 7,500.</TE>
<TE>   Players have also had to contend with a backdrop that has been known
to significantly lower shooting percentages and humble even the best
marksmen.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2000 Division II-AA championship, Brea Olinda, a team that
relied on its perimeter game to reach the final, made one of 15
three-point shots and 10 of 43 field-goal attempts.</TE>
<TE>   With the section's five-year contract with the Pond set to expire
after the 2002-2003 school year, now might be an appropriate time to
evaluate other venues for the future.</TE>
<TE>   The best alternative appears to be the Anaheim Convention Center,
which seats 7,700, has a decent shooting backdrop and generates a
high-energy atmosphere when filled near capacity.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it. I think it's probably one of the most underused arenas in
America," said Villa Park Coach Kevin Reynolds, whose teams have played
at the Pond and the Convention Center. "I think 6,000 people in [the
Convention Center] would pack the place and it looks awesome with a great
atmosphere as opposed to 6,000 people at the Pond, where it doesn't look
like there's anybody there."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Castillo, the section's assistant commissioner who oversees boys'
basketball, said the Convention Center has been mentioned as a possible
venue for championships. But so far there has not been much of a push to
move into a new arena.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't looked too hard into Anaheim at this point because of our
contract with the Pond," Castillo said. "We need venues that will seat
between 10,000-13,000. Last year, we had an exceptional crowd and no
place else would have held us."</TE>
<TE>   Combined attendance for the morning and evening sessions last season
was 21,131, shy of the all-time mark of 25,739 set in 1994 but a drastic
improvement over the 2000 attendance figure. It's important to remember,
though, that last season's attendance was spread over seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Danley, the director of athletics for the Anaheim Union High
School District, said the Convention Center would be an ideal venue for
the championships but acknowledged that the ball is in the court of
section officials.</TE>
<TE>   "The Anaheim Convention Center is one of the best-kept secrets as far
as an outstanding arena for sporting events in the entire state of
California," Danley said. "This would undoubtedly be a great place not
only to hold Southern Section finals but regionals for the state
playoffs."</TE>

<TE>   Back on track: A week ago, Mater Dei was standing on shaky legs. The
Monarchs were riding the first three-game losing streak of Coach Gary
McKnight's 20-year tenure and faced the grim prospect of facing Corona
Centennial in the championship game of the Orange tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The way Mater Dei was playing, there were no assurances it would even
make it that far. And if the Monarchs did, they would have to contend
with a Centennial team that had already handed them a two-point loss.</TE>
<TE>   But after blowout victories over Anaheim, Foothill and Orange, Mater
Dei socked it to Centennial on Saturday with an 84-67 triumph that left
little doubt as to which was the better team. Guard Wesley Washington
scored 21 points for the Monarchs, who used an 8-0 third-quarter run to
break open a tight game.</TE>
<TE>   "We did a lot better job of executing our offense [than in the
previous meeting]," McKnight said. "We did a real good job of ball
movement, making the extra pass, and that made all the difference for
us."</TE>
<TE>   McKnight attributed part of his team's success to a consistent
starting lineup comprising Mike Gerrity, Trevante Nelson, Mike
Strawberry, Harrison Schaen and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Schaen, whose effectiveness had been limited earlier in the season
because of lingering foot problems, is starting to become the post player
he will need to be if the Monarchs are to win their fourth consecutive
Southern Section title.</TE>
<TE>   But Mater Dei (11-4), No. 9 in The Times' rankings, can't afford to
look that far ahead. The Monarchs play No. 13 Villa Park on Friday and
Mouth of Wilson (Va.) Oak Hill Academy, the top-ranked team in the
nation, on Feb. 2. Mater Dei's Serra League schedule includes a combined
four games against No. 3 Santa Margarita and No. 21 Bellflower St. John
Bosco.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got some tough teams ahead of us," McKnight said. "We're going
to have to step up."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Making the grade: Palm Desert guard Josh Zazulia not only can make the
three-pointer but probably could calculate the trajectory of each shot
before it sailed through the net.</TE>
<TE>   Zazulia, who has a 4.5 grade-point average and scored 1,240 on the
SAT, is part of a starting lineup that averages a 4.1 GPA.</TE>
<TE>   The Aztecs' top 10 players average a 3.9 GPA, and three guards scored
at least 1,300 on the SAT.</TE>
<TE>   "We play student-athletes who understand the game," said Coach Don
Brady, whose players are also heavily involved in volunteer work and
regularly speak to elementary and middle school students about good
choices.</TE>

<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>Looking back over the 10 years since the demise of the Soviet
Union, many Russians are apt to say it was a disappointing decade--their
hopes for democracy were dashed by criminals and gangsters, and hopes for
prosperity ended in lawlessness, poverty and despair.</LD>
<LD>   But that would not be the view of Alexander Maryagin, a walking symbol
of how this land has changed.</LD>
<LD>   On Dec. 31, 1991, the day the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
faded into history, Maryagin was a 21-year-old, wandering the grim
streets of Moscow, a place of empty store shelves and long vodka lines.
Back then, he would sometimes hawk calculators on the freezing pavement
outside a railway station.</LD>
<TE>   "At that time, I couldn't even imagine that I would ever own a car,
let alone drive it myself," Maryagin said recently, seated in a chic cafe
as though he owned the place. (He does, in fact, own part of it.) "It was
like thinking about flying to the moon."</TE>
<TE>   Maryagin did not have success handed to him. Instead, he lived the
American dream--in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   He started with nothing, toiled 24 hours a day, seven days a week. He
made countless shopping trips to Turkey to buy cheap goods to sell in
Russian markets. He paid bribes when he had to. He plowed his earnings
back into his business and seldom had time to look at his calendar or his
watch.</TE>
<TE>   Today he owns shares of two cafes and a shopping center and is looking
into acquiring cinemas. He has an apartment and a 4-acre estate, and when
he wants to drive someplace, he can choose from his Dodge Durango, his
Jeep Grand Cherokee or his Lincoln Town Car.</TE>
<TE>   "And I created all this from scratch with my own hands in my own city
in my own country," the 31-year-old says in a voice that expresses more
marvel than boast.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me that Moscow today is entering a stage which can be
described as la dolce vita compared to the gray and cold Soviet times,
which seem like hundreds of years ago."</TE>
<TE>   The revolution that has taken place in Russia, the largest and most
populous part of the former Soviet Union, has been chaotic, drawn out and
marked by false starts and retreats. Even today, few could argue that it
is finished.</TE>
<TE>   But on the whole, most analysts and observers believe that Russia is
well on its way to becoming what many Russians and almost everyone in the
West would have wished for: a country of free markets, democratically
elected government and private property operating under the rule of law.</TE>
<TE>   President Vladimir V. Putin heralded that assessment Monday night in
his annual New Year's address to the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "The year 2001 differed significantly from those that preceded it,"
Putin said. "We managed not only to maintain the growth in our economy,
but also to improve people's lives, at least to a small degree."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, each item on Russia's list of achievements can be debated:
How free are the markets when bureaucrats and gangsters can demand bribes
and protection money? How democratic are the elections when small parties
have been limited and local governors use "administrative means" to shape
voting results? Is private property really private when there is scant
respect for ownership by courts beholden to those in power?</TE>
<TE>   Yet there is a sense that these phenomena are on the decline and that
the country is slowly becoming more orderly. Surveys indicate that the
10th anniversary of the end of the U.S.S.R. finds the Russian people more
optimistic than they have ever been in the post-Soviet era.</TE>
<TE>   "Today a majority of people are inclined to believe that the worst
times are already over," said Vyacheslav A. Nikonov, president of the
Politika Foundation, a Moscow think tank. "People are looking to the
future with a greater optimism, though they regard the last decade as an
epoch of huge failures."</TE>
<TE>   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader who started the reforms in the
1980s and sealed the end of the union with his resignation Dec. 25, 1991,
said the process of building Russia is ongoing.</TE>
<TE>   "But it is already a serious, accomplished fact," Gorbachev said in an
interview with The Times earlier this year. "People who have tasted
independence and freedom will never part with it. And thank God for
that!"</TE>
<TE>   Such an optimistic, albeit cautious, outlook might come as a surprise
to Western pundits who sometimes used to argue over "Who lost Russia?"</TE>
<TE>   In the waning days of the Clinton administration, it had become a
truism on the talk show circuit that the United States had made big
mistakes in its policy toward Russia: It was said to have been
inattentive, or too wanton with aid, or else had an overly personalized
attachment to ex-President Boris N. Yeltsin.</TE>
<TE>   As Yeltsin's health and grip on power waned, the Russian currency
collapsed and a generation of kleptocrats and robber barons fought in the
courts and the streets over national assets. Vast, nuclear-armed Russia
was widely thought to be in danger of disintegrating into anarchy or
giving rise to a new authoritarian dictatorship.</TE>
<TE>Common Wisdom Was Frequently Wrong</TE>
<TE>   "Never have so many people been so wrong about such an important issue
in U.S. foreign policy," wrote Michael McFaul, a senior associate at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</TE>
<TE>   In his recent book, "Russia's Unfinished Revolution, Political Change
From Gorbachev to Putin," McFaul describes Russia as being on a positive
trajectory toward democracy and free markets. In earlier writings, he
dismissed the notion that Russia could be lost by the West, assessing
U.S. influence on Russia's internal politics as at best marginal.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, when we can finally make the determination if
Russia has been won or lost, it will be Russians who should be blamed or
praised, not Americans," McFaul said.</TE>
<TE>   Nikonov, of the Politika Foundation, agreed: "I always believed that a
couple of our own idiots can do more harm inside the country than any
Western aid or advice."</TE>
<TE>   But he and other Russians believe that some of the Western economic
advice their country received just after the dissolution of the Soviet
Union only worsened the country's plight.</TE>
<TE>   "They came in here with recipes [that] in principle can be implemented
only in countries with a developed market economy," Nikonov said. "They
suggested Russia live by the laws of a normal market system when even the
legal basis for a free market was not yet constructed, and when no one in
the country had a clue what a market was all about."</TE>
<TE>   Anders Aslund, another Carnegie Endowment associate who has studied
Russia's transformation, rejects arguments that the West harmed Russia by
pushing it to reform too quickly. He also labels as mythology the
official statistics indicating that Russian economic output plunged 44%
between 1989 and 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Aslund, whose book "Building Capitalism: The Transformation of the
Former Soviet Bloc" came out last year, says Soviet economic statistics
were padded to make the economy look far better than it actually was. And
much post-Soviet economic activity has been off the books to avoid
taxes--making output look worse than it actually is. The result, as he
sees it, is a wash.</TE>
<TE>   "Thus, the Russian economy hasn't collapsed. Rather, it is more
accurate to say that, until 1998, the economy stagnated because of
sluggish and incomplete reforms. Russia's level of economic development
remains where it was during the Soviet era, roughly on par with Brazil,"
Aslund wrote in Foreign Policy magazine last summer.</TE>
<TE>   In the last three years, the Russian economy has begun to grow
dramatically, which analysts say is a result of higher oil prices, less
dependence on foreign-made goods and a firmer commitment to reforms by
the central government. In 2001, Putin pushed through legislation that
finally permitted private ownership of land, and a simple flat tax of 13%
on personal income, which has led to higher tax collections.</TE>
<TE>   All along, Aslund said, the problem was not that Russia's reforms were
too radical, but rather that they were too weak.</TE>
<TE>   There was "too little shock and too much corrupt state therapy in the
form of subsidies to the country's elite," Aslund said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, for every winner like Maryagin, there are many who feel
worse off. There are millions of people struggling to survive on a
rudimentary wage or pension, eating state-subsidized dairy products and
bread and the occasional home-grown vegetable.</TE>
<TE>   They are unable to travel or buy new clothes, and they lack the means
to cope with sudden emergencies without borrowing from family or
neighbors, says Yelena Bashkirova, who tracks living trends as director
general of the Russian Public Opinion and Market Research Service.</TE>
<TE>   The entire Soviet-era society was relatively poor, with few
differences in income, she says. Today, she estimates, about 10% of
Russians could be called rich, 30% make up a newly emerging middle class,
and 60% are poor, based on their consumption habits.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the large number of poor, she pointed out that only about
one-quarter to one-third of the public is dissatisfied enough to support
the Communist Party. Two-thirds or more supports Putin.</TE>
<TE>   Bashkirova sees public opinion moving in the direction of democracy.</TE>
<TE>   "We can feel a tendency already, though probably a small one. . . .
Because this is now our life. Because no one can believe now, can't even
think, that we would not have free elections. . . . This is very
important."</TE>
<TE>Paying a Price for Democratic Society</TE>
<TE>   What has changed in the last 10 years, Bashkirova said, is a falling
away of illusions that the transition would be easy.</TE>
<TE>   Russians "now understand that they should pay the price for being a
democratic society, that they should now rely more on themselves rather
than on the state."</TE>
<TE>   Nikonov pointed out the contradiction that still persists in the minds
of many Russians.</TE>
<TE>   "When you poll people with a question whether they regard the breakup
of the Soviet Union as a tragedy or a mistake, naturally a majority will
say yes. If you ask people whether they consider the reforms of Gorbachev
and Yeltsin as wrong, a majority will say yes," he said. "But if you ask
people whether they want to go back, a majority will say no!"</TE>
<TE>   Maryagin reckons that more than 30 families now earn middle-class
incomes of at least $500 a month as a result of the business he started.
He is proud of what Russians have achieved.</TE>
<TE>   He once considered emigrating, but is glad he did not. "My country is
where I live now. And I hope my partners and I have somehow contributed
to changing it for the better," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I like what is happening now," he said. "I like it that laws are
beginning to be obeyed. Life is becoming predictable, normal and
comfortable--for the first time in many, many years."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FRANKFURT, Germany
</DL>
<LD>More than 300 million Europeans adopted the euro as their common
currency today, finally fulfilling calls for greater unity and
integration by putting their money where their mouths are.</LD>
<LD>   The long-awaited E-day arrived with much fanfare and
self-congratulation, although it was hard to tell how much of the
celebration was over the shiny new coins and colorful bank notes and how
much was due to the traditional New Year's fireworks and revelry in the
12 participating nations.</LD>
<LD>   Outside the European Central Bank here, the birthplace of the euro,
pyrotechnics, ear-splitting explosions and a pall of smoke greeted 2002
and the advent of the world's second-largest monetary system after that
of the U.S. From Helsinki in Finland to the Canary Islands, concerts
heralded the euro and sound-and-light shows illuminated giant replicas of
the coins and bills. The Pont Neuf in Paris, the oldest bridge in the
City of Light, was illuminated with the euro's predominant color, blue,
and adorned with national flags along its dozen arches.</LD>
<TE>   While many Europeans continued to bemoan the loss of their trusted
national currencies--especially in Germany, where the sturdy mark has
been a symbol of stability for half a century--the euro enjoyed a modest
rise in popularity amid the final countdown.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a bit tragic," said Manfred Obels, a salesman waiting his turn
to collect euros shortly after midnight at a Dresdner Bank cash machine.
"We'll miss our marks, although I guess this is for the good of Europe."</TE>
<TE>   Euros have been edging their way into continental consciousness for
three years now, as exchange rates among the states were fixed with the
Jan. 1, 1999, launch of the "virtual currency." The European Central Bank
has controlled interest rates throughout the euro-zone since then, bank
balances have been appearing in both currencies, and billions in
euro-denominated stocks and bonds have been traded during the changeover.</TE>
<TE>   But actually getting the money into their hands was a signal event for
Europeans and the world's largest exchange of currency. Revelers lined up
at automated teller machines at the stroke of midnight to get their first
infusions of the 14 billion bills that had been withheld from the public
to prevent counterfeiting and confusion. It took at least 10 minutes for
most of the ATMs to load their new programs, but customers were getting
their money in time to pay in euros for the last rounds of champagne and
mulled wine.</TE>
<TE>   The first of 52 billion coins minted for the cause began reaching
euro-zone residents two weeks ago, when banks sold "starter kits" to get
consumers used to the look and feel of the new money. More than 450
million of the eight-coin packs were sold for the equivalent of about $10
each--twice as many as euro planners had calculated and a sign that
citizens were warming to the new money.</TE>
<TE>   While economists and political leaders have been trumpeting the common
currency as the crowning event in the creation of a powerful new economic
bloc, the citizens of the larger euro countries have been decidedly less
enthusiastic. The latest polls in Germany, the most populous and powerful
of the euro states, have shown two out of three respondents still opposed
to giving up their marks. In France, 55% of citizens are mourning the
loss of the franc. Even in Greece, one of the countries expected to
benefit most from the euro, half those surveyed Friday by the Greek
Federation of Retailers said they were not yet ready for the euro.</TE>
<TE>   Sharing a monetary instrument is expected to deepen the integration of
European Union member states that began 50 years ago with the first,
six-nation bloc coordinating coal and steel trading. Not only will
euro-zone residents enjoy the convenience of using the same money
wherever they travel within the region, but the Stability and Growth Pact
aims to ease coordination among the countries' economies and to curb debt
and inflation.</TE>
<TE>   European economic stewards are hoping the euro will enjoy a resurgence
now that it is a physical part of daily life. The currency has lost more
than 20% of its value vis-a-vis the dollar since its introduction three
years ago, falling from $1.17 to about 88 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Hailing "this little bit of united Europe we now hold in our hands,"
EU Executive Commission President Romano Prodi said the 660 billion euros
created--$580 billion worth--give Europeans a new identity and more clout
in global financial affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "To have the same currency is not just an economic decision, it's a
political decision," Prodi said. "You have to harmonize many behaviors,
organize decision-making processes in case of a crisis in one of the
countries or erratic shocks."</TE>
<TE>   Prodi and others reminded Europeans of the debt of gratitude they owe
the euro's early proponents, notably former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
and the late French President Francois Mitterrand.</TE>
<TE>   "Our money will be a true catalyst for integration," European Central
Bank President Wim Duisenberg told journalists.</TE>
<TE>   The euro's reach actually extends far beyond the member
states--Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland,
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Three other EU
nations--Britain, Sweden and Denmark--have opted out of currency union
for the time being, but much of their business will be transacted in
euros and they are expected to eventually join. The Yugoslav republic of
Montenegro and Kosovo, a province of its fellow republic, Serbia--where
marks were legal tender--will now use the euro, as will colonies and
territories of EU states ranging from French Guyana to the Indian Ocean
island of Reunion. Andorra, San Marino, Monaco and Vatican City, as EU
stepchildren, will also be euro states.</TE>
<TE>   Preparations for swapping out the national currencies intensified in
recent weeks, with vendors of soft drinks, snacks, transport and parking
tickets racing to retool their dispensers to take the new coins and
bills.</TE>
<TE>   European Central Bank planners estimated that 70% of the euro-zone's
170,000 ATMs were ready with euro cash by midnight Monday. Coca-Cola
alone had to adjust 288,000 vending machines, and Germany's 830,000
cigarette dispensers were all ready to accept both marks and euros.</TE>
<TE>   The changeover has cost banks and businesses billions, but the euro
has also been a boon for many. Charities and aid organizations like the
Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders, Oxfam and land-mind awareness groups
set up collection boxes at airports and train stations to gather small
coins from consumers who didn't want to bother to trade them.
Manufacturers of cash-register tills and wallets designed to accommodate
the euro also cashed in. The Irish Independent reported that bus
passengers outside Dublin could get free rides if they didn't have the
exact change on E-day, since drivers had warned that their new cash
dispensers didn't have enough slots for the coins.</TE>
<TE>   Both euros and the national currencies will be accepted during a
two-month transition period, but European Central Bank analysts expect
95% of transactions to be conducted in euros by mid-January.</TE>
<TE>   In some countries like Portugal where ATM withdrawals are without
commission, consumers tend to take out only small amounts of cash on a
daily basis so are unlikely to have huge amounts of escudos they need to
get rid of. Credit card use is also expected to rise, even among
cash-oriented Germans, as a way of avoiding confusion until consumers are
more comfortable with the euro.</TE>
<TE>   One of the more enthusiastic euro-zone members, Finland, opened its
central bank at midnight to allow its citizens a chance to change their
markkaa for euros in person. Most euro countries simply left consumers to
deal with ATMs or wait until businesses reopen Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In Italy, where waiting until the last minute to deal with change is a
matter of proud tradition, small-business owners conceded without chagrin
that they weren't ready.</TE>
<TE>   "If I don't have change in euros, I will give the change in lire. I
cannot have huge amounts of money in my shop," said produce vendor Gianna
Ballerina, who had yet to collect euros from the bank Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Only about 4% of the country's 30,000 ATMs were loaded with euros on
time, and most of them had been taken out of service throughout the
weekend to get them ready.</TE>
<TE>   Some euro nations braced for the change by stepping up defenses. In
Spain, national police spokesman Jose Maria Seara said the number of
officers on the streets was boosted by 12% for the changeover out of
concern that the mix of drinking and unfamiliar transactions would lead
to some heated misunderstandings.</TE>
<TE>   "After celebrating and then getting their change, some people are sure
to argue and even fight over being cheated," Seara said. "They'll wind up
in the police station."</TE>

their TVs for 13 hours Wednesday and Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Nakamura ran with all his might on the second and longest leg of the
brutal, 130-mile Hakone Ekiden relay a few years ago. But his bum knee
kicked in, and for miles seemingly all of Japan watched as Nakamura--then
an Olympic marathon contender--hobbled and grimaced but refused to throw
in the towel.</LD>
<LD>   His coach finally took matters into his own hands, giving Nakamura the
feared tap on the shoulder, meaning "You're out." Nakamura covered his
eyes with his hand, grabbed on to his coach's car for support, and wept.</LD>
<TE>   His entire squad was disqualified, but his teammates ran their paces
anyway, forced to wear a yellow sash--a sash of dishonor.</TE>
<TE>   The annual Hakone Ekiden is to New Year's in Japan what the Rose Bowl
is to the United States, and then some. Maybe with the NCAA Final Four
thrown in.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen 10-member, all-male squads from Japan's universities compete.
Schools go so far as to recruit athletes from Africa, who stand out among
the otherwise homogenous Japanese runners.</TE>
<TE>   It is a grueling competition, with runners frequently collapsing from
dehydration; no water was allowed until recently, and even now it is
permitted only once each relay leg, at the 10-kilometer mark, roughly the
halfway point. (In a marathon, it is furnished every five kilometers,
about three miles.)</TE>
<TE>   "It's only 20 kilometers. They don't need water," says legendary
marathoner and ekiden racer Toshihiko Seko, who won the Boston Marathon
twice and now coaches a corporate team for other ekidens.</TE>
<TE>   Millions line the asphalt route from downtown Tokyo to the resort town
of Hakone, while millions more watch from home during the O-Shogatsu (New
Year's) holidays that virtually shut down Japan for the week.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that the Japanese are getting drunk on sake while the kids
are out there killing themselves adds to the drama," says Robert Whiting,
an expert on Japanese sports. "Leave it to the Japanese to think of
something more difficult than a marathon."</TE>
<TE>   Some call the race a metaphor for the samurai spirit. "It symbolizes
life itself," says Kenji Asai, 58, a company worker. "Even if you alone
win your leg [of the race], it's not that meaningful. You have to work as
a team and trust each other. You have to pass something [the tasuki, or
team sash] to the others to get to the goal."</TE>
<TE>   Adds his wife, Yoko, 55, a homemaker whose heart aches for runners who
struggle: "It's so profound. I see the greatness of human strength and
will through ekiden."</TE>
<TE>   But the race also shows a dark side of Japan's vaunted teamwork.</TE>
<TE>   While there are no superheroes in the ekiden--even a superhuman
performance by a runner won't guarantee a win--anyone who lets the team
down shoulders an overwhelming sense of personal responsibility. Athletes
who get sick or injured and can't complete their legs often find that the
race haunts them forever, ruining their running careers and even their
lives.</TE>
<TE>   Historical failures are dredged up annually on television programs and
in magazines previewing the race.</TE>
<TE>   Takashi Sugisaki was anchor of the 1974 team when he stumbled about a
mile before the end, picked himself up, then fainted from exhaustion not
far from the finish line. "Because of me, the sash of Aoyama Gakuin
University was dishonored," he recalled in the 1994 book "Enjoy Hakone
Ekiden 10 Times More." "It's been more than 20 years, but I'm still
struggling with that 150 meters."</TE>
<TE>   Nakamura, who got the tap on the shoulder in 1996, considered suicide.
"I was so sad, had so many regrets and was in shock because I'd done
something from which I could never redeem myself," he recalled in a
telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   The first ekiden, in 1917, was 304 miles long and lasted three days.
Runners stopped at 23 eki, or postal stations, along major roads to
commemorate the 50th anniversary of the transfer of power from the
ancient capital of Kyoto to Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   Ekidens are now run in places around the world, with races tailored
for high schoolers, girls, professional squads sponsored by corporations
and others--and with courses that are usually far shorter.</TE>
<TE>   But the Hakone Ekiden, which dates to 1924, seems to border on the
sadistic. Each squad member runs close to a half-marathon. (Five racers
run each day, and the entire thing is televised live.) To train, teams
run up and down mountains in Nagano, site of the 1998 Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   One leg of the Hakone course is virtually entirely uphill, a slow
climb up a mountain that makes the Boston Marathon's Heartbreak Hill look
like an anthill. The next leg, coming down, is brutal on the knees.</TE>
<TE>   Runners sometimes battle snow and ice, heavy winds and freezing
rain--that's part of the poetry, apparently.</TE>
<TE>   "The true pleasure is found after going through agony," the late
Shoichiro Takenaka, recalling at age 80 his ekiden races in the 1930s,
said in a television documentary. "There's no play without struggle and
agony."</TE>
<TE>   The runners get sick, dehydrate, collapse, swoon, and still they don't
give up, for there are no substitutions allowed once the race starts.
They press as hard as they can to deliver the tasuki even one second
faster to their teammate. If any runner falls more than 10 minutes behind
the leader, the entire team forfeits. And any team that is disqualified
forfeits its automatic berth in the following year's race.</TE>
<TE>   "Because my school has a long tradition, and so many fans and
graduates are supporting us, I feel the great importance of the tasuki,"
said runner Makoto Yabana of Waseda University, which lost its seeding
last year and is ranked 10th this year. "So I must not stop--even if I
die."</TE>
<TE>   The ekiden requires more complex strategies than Western relays, in
which the strongest runner usually runs the last leg. The second leg in
the ekiden, about 14 miles, is the longest, so it is usually given to the
top runner. For other legs, coaches must consider criteria such as who
runs best uphill and who performs best in the morning cold and afternoon
warmth.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., sports have long been played for enjoyment and to release
tension, motives that are secondary in Japan to doryoku, or effort--which
is an end in itself, says Whiting, who lives in Japan and wrote "You
Gotta Have Wa," a book about Japanese baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "Japanese grafted the philosophy of martial arts, based on zen-samurai
thought, onto imported foreign sports--a philosophy stressing endless
training, dedication, development of spirit, obedience and
self-sacrifice," Whiting says. "The idea was to teach the all-important
lesson that nothing comes easy in life."</TE>
<TE>   Hence, Japan's "Thousand Fungo Drill" for baseball fielding and
throwing practice. Instead of letting players quit when they tire, that's
the time Japanese coaches really turn up the heat, continuing the drill
until the athletes literally drop from exhaustion.</TE>
<TE>   Naohiko Arai, producer of the ekiden television program for the NTV
network, argues that enjoyment is becoming more important in Japan. "Now
most runners respond like an American--'I'm doing this for my own sake.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Seko, the marathoner and ekiden coach, says, "Of course I love
running, but there'd be a problem in Japan if I said it was all about me,
me, me."</TE>
<TE>   Pressure to win is intertwined with national identity. When marathoner
Kokichi Tsuburaya won a bronze medal in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, he
apologized. Four years later, after suffering an injury while training
for the next games--and finding his former fiancee, whom his coach had
refused to let him marry for fear of disrupting his concentration, wed to
someone else--he killed himself, leaving behind a note again apologizing
for letting his country down.</TE>
<TE>   Apologies, and tears, abound in Japan for anything less than a
gold-medal performance. "How disappointing," said Olympic swimmer Yasuko
Tajima upon earning the silver in the 400-meter individual medley at the
Sydney Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Seko, who previously coached Waseda's ekiden team, says the pressure
becomes particularly fierce as an athlete gets more prominent.</TE>
<TE>   Runners feel they owe something to their schools. Pressure ratchets up
all the more as fans wave school flags and cheer the runners on.
"Gambare!"--fight harder--they scream. In some years, the coaches have
run alongside their charges, singing the school song, bringing tears to
the eyes of both runner and coach.</TE>
<TE>   But coaches must also be mindful that the Hakone Ekiden can ruin a
good runner, Seko says.</TE>
<TE>   In his first year as a coach at Waseda, Seko put Seiji Kushibe in the
race the day after he'd gotten food poisoning from sashimi donated by an
alumnus.</TE>
<TE>   There was great pressure for him to run: Kushibe's time was five
minutes faster than the substitute's, and he seemed fine the morning of
the race. But as he ran, he began to swoon, became delusional and could
barely keep himself upright as he handed over the tasuki in dead last
place.</TE>
<TE>   In later years, Kushibe worked hard and ran tremendously well in
practice sessions--but he faltered in marathons and ekidens, developing
blisters or becoming dehydrated, Seko says.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten years later, he's still dragging that feeling around," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Takashi Ito, who last year couldn't complete his leg of the race
because of a fever, says frankly that he's "still sort of depressed. I
just can't forget it."</TE>
<TE>   Ito, now with Japan's Self-Defense Forces, blames himself. "There was
criticism of the coach to let me run," he says stoically. "Yes, Japanese
do try to internalize the blame, but overall in my case, I still think
it's my fault. . . . I had a mission to pursue and I couldn't pursue it.
It's nobody else's fault but mine. It's also my fault that I had a fever
the previous night."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Seko agrees that, indeed, athletes are to blame if they get
sick.</TE>
<TE>   "If they catch a cold, it's because they should have been careful. I
tell them every day, don't eat sashimi or drink cold milk in the morning.
Go to bed early."</TE>
<TE>   He also tells them to avoid crowded places, which is akin to telling a
driver in Los Angeles to avoid the freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Yuji Nakamura's televised breakdown came during his junior year at
Yamanashi Gakuin University. He rarely left his dorm room for four months
afterward and barely uttered a word to anyone. Moreover, his knee injury
had ruined his chances to compete as an Olympic marathoner.</TE>
<TE>   Then, after watching his kohai, a younger student whom he had
mentored, compete in a race, Nakamura began to feel miserable being on
the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   In June 1996, he was invited by a corporate team to do high-altitude
training in Boulder, Colo., and he got back into a rigorous training
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   As New Year's and the Hakone Ekiden drew closer that year, however,
his nerves became tighter. With two weeks to go, chronic diarrhea kicked
in. He couldn't sleep, could barely eat. The night before the race, he
was so exhausted that he slept as if he were in a coma.</TE>
<TE>   On race day, Nakamura awoke refreshed. His coach jogged with him to
see how he was holding up. "He didn't say anything, and I didn't say
anything," Nakamura recalls. "Everything was communicated without words."</TE>
<TE>   When he got the Persian-blue tasuki after the first leg, his team was
far behind. Somehow, he managed to summon his energy and focus as never
before. He fell into a trance so deep, he didn't notice his parents or
all the supporters on the sidelines cheering him on. All he could see was
an image of himself running a step at a time. One by one, he overtook all
eight runners ahead of him; when he handed over the tasuki, his team was
in first place. An enormous wave of relief washed over him.</TE>
<TE>   The team's lead waxed and waned over the next several legs, and his
team ultimately placed second.</TE>
<TE>   The comeback didn't alleviate Nakamura's misgivings over his failure a
year earlier. But his spirits were bolstered when he received a homemade
video of a fourth-grade class acting out his trials in the earlier race
and his triumphant return.</TE>
<TE>   Now, after running on a corporate team for five years, the tall and
willowy Nakamura, 31, is back on his family's farm in southern Japan,
growing melons and rice. He still runs in shorter local races.</TE>
<TE>   If he had it all to do again, would he run that dismal year? He says
it made him stronger. "Such huge pressure is one of the attractions. Many
students want to break through the pressure and achieve."</TE>
<TE>   And if he ever has a son, "I'd wish for him to run Hakone too."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Navy Keeping an Eye on Possible Escape Route</HD>
<DH>Manhunt: Ships, planes monitor Arabian Sea for signs of Al Qaeda
leaders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ABOARD A NAVY SURVEILLANCE PLANE OVER THE ARABIAN SEA
</DL>
<LD>While American soldiers search for Osama bin Laden and others in
the caves and mountains of Afghanistan, the U.S. Navy is scouring the
vast stretches of the Arabian Sea in a manhunt of immense scope and
intensity.</LD>
<LD>   P-3C Orion surveillance planes linked to a regional operations center
and U.S. and allied ships are guarding against an attempt by Al Qaeda and
Taliban leaders to escape by boat to Yemen, Somalia or some other
country.</LD>
<LD>   The patch on the flight suit of Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Adam
Stewart tells the story.</LD>
<TE>   "9/11. Terror Cannot Hide. Tracking America's Most Wanted. Operation
Enduring Freedom 2001," the patch reads. It is done up like the logo of
the popular "America's Most Wanted" TV show, complete with a menacing
eagle in the background.</TE>
<TE>   "We're tightening the noose," said Cmdr. Doug Yancey, 48, of
Lancaster, Calif., commanding officer of the "Skinny Dragons" Navy
squadron from Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. "We know the terrorists are trying to
rally around their leaders and find a new place to spread their
terrorism. If we can catch them, maybe we can prevent another" incident
like the assaults on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   It is a daunting task. Visibility is good on most days, but the
Arabian Sea is one of the most heavily traveled merchant marine lanes in
the world.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. intelligence network provides a constantly updated list of
ships the Taliban and Al Qaeda could possibly use to make their escape
via Pakistan into the open sea.</TE>
<TE>   It has become a kind of cat-and-mouse game, with many ships changing
their appearance regularly for reasons that are unclear, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "Some are getting very tricky," said Lt. Cmdr. Brett Bonifay, 35, of
Norman, Okla. "They repaint their hulls, they paint over their numbers,
they change things on their deck to look different. Sometimes we look
closer and see the paint on the numbers is still running."</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,000 "bridge-to-bridge" radio contacts have been made since
November between foreign ships at sea and a network of U.S. planes and
ships. The foreign ships are asked a series of questions about their
cargo, route, destination, home port and other matters the U.S. can check
against its intelligence files. Sometimes the same ship is quizzed
multiple times.</TE>
<TE>   Five ships have been boarded and searched by heavily armed U.S.
sailors equipped with a rogues' gallery of mug shots, including that of
Bin Laden. There have been no incidents but also no arrests.</TE>
<TE>   As the Orion 012, one of 10 Orions in the region, spent Monday on an
eight-hour mission to check out dozens of ships below, the mood was
mostly upbeat. "I can feel it. He's out there," said Lt. Kelly Hinderer,
30, of Jackson, Mich. "It's only a matter of time."</TE>
<TE>   Timing has favored the Orion. Just weeks before Sept. 11, the planes
underwent an extensive upgrade to increase the range and clarity of their
surveillance cameras and the ability of their computers to transmit
real-time photos to onshore analysts.</TE>
<TE>   The P-3C Orion--a variant of the plane that gained international
attention after it collided with a Chinese fighter jet on April 1--is one
of the older planes in the U.S. military, with many of the craft dating
from the 1970s. This makes them older than some of the crew members, such
as Stewart, 22, of Phoenix, an electronics technician.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not going to get past us," Stewart said. "We're looking at
everything from the littlest boat to the biggest."</TE>
<TE>   Whether Bin Laden and his top Al Qaeda cronies are dead, hunkered down
or seeking to flee is the big mystery of the Afghan campaign. One theory
taken seriously by U.S. military planners is that the head of the
terrorist network has always counted on an escape by sea.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda is known to have a small flotilla. It has airplanes too, but
with the U.S. military superiority in the skies, an escape by air would
seem foolhardy.</TE>
<TE>   Miles of porous coastline and the prospect of supporters in nearby
countries make a sea escape seem plausible, analysts believe. For that
reason, the U.S. put together what it calls the "leadership interdiction
operation" in early November.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the searching techniques used by the Orion squadron were honed
during anti-drug surveillance off the West Coast of the U.S. "We like to
put away bad guys," said Bonifay, officer in charge of one of three
detachments in the squadron.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the Orion 012's crew of nine men and two women was given a
section of the sea spreading 120 miles by 60 miles; other Orions were
responsible for other sections. Patrolling continues day and night; night
patrols are aided by new infrared technology.</TE>
<TE>   When the plane spots a possible "high-interest target," images are
flashed back to the operations center and then to U.S. ships in the area.
On Monday, the plane was working with ships attached to the John C.
Stennis carrier battle group.</TE>
<TE>   Like any manhunt, the secret lies in endurance. "We checked out a lot
[of targets], but nothing panned out," said Hinderer, the plane's senior
navigator. "It can get frustrating."</TE>
<TE>   The Orions, once used primarily to hunt Soviet submarines during the
Cold War, have been retrofitted for other missions. The planes, built by
Lockheed-Martin, can carry a variety of weapons, including missiles, to
provide cover for ground troops, though the craft is not being used in
this capacity in the current mission.</TE>
<TE>   It cheers the crew members of the Orions that Bin Laden's agony may be
increased by the possibility of being spotted from the air.</TE>
<TE>   "I noticed that our friend Bin Laden doesn't look so good anymore,"
said Petty Officer 2nd Class Ron Williams, 37, of Baton Rouge, La., a
flight engineer. "He used to look chubby and healthy. Now he looks drawn
and stressed out. I like to think we're contributing to that."</TE>

<HD>A Guarded New York Welcomes New Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Under the watchful eyes of 7,000 police, some carrying radiation
detection devices, more than half a million people crowded into Times
Square on Monday night for an emotional New Year's Eve celebration
dominated by remembrance of the World Trade Center attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Long before the fabled ball dropped at midnight, bells began ringing
at 6 p.m. from churches, synagogues, mosques and homes throughout the
city to commemorate those who died Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   As the clock inched toward midnight, the faces of firefighters lost in
the attack were flashed on a Jumbotron screen above the packed streets, a
moment that silenced many in the normally festive, horn-blowing crowd.</LD>
<TE>   "I came to pay my respects to all of these people who died, and also
to look ahead to the future," Queens resident Joe Esposito said. "But I
should also say: I came here to party."</TE>
<TE>   While the crowd was smaller than the 700,000 who showed up in Times
Square for New Year's Eve in 1999, Monday's noisy throng spilled out of
special enclosures set up by police on the streets and overflowed onto
the sidewalks, creating pedestrian gridlock. On a numbingly cold and
windy night, people came from all over the world to ring in the new
year--and to show solidarity with the people of New York City--at the
country's noisiest party.</TE>
<TE>   "We worry about terrorism, but it is important to be here, to show we
care," said Sojin Ahn, a Korean American college student from San
Francisco who had just flown in with two friends. "This is the place to
be, and to be hopeful. I can't wait for 2002 to arrive."</TE>
<TE>   It also was a night to say goodbye: Shortly after midnight, departing
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani swore in his successor, Michael Bloomberg, and
began his new life as a private citizen. The crowd cheered his image as
it flashed on a giant screen, then faded from view.</TE>
<TE>   Few in the crowd seemed to mind the bomb-sniffing dogs and the long
lines at checkpoints to enter the Times Square area. All through the
night, police helicopters swooped over the crowded scene and NYPD
sharpshooters quietly patrolled rooftops. Special squads were poised to
detect any chemical or biological warfare attack, and the radiation
devices held by police officers were intended to detect possible
explosions of crude nuclear bombs.</TE>
<TE>   There were no disruptions, and city officials encouraged people to
have a good time. Yet the signs of heightened security were everywhere.
Police banned backpacks and searched party goers with hand-held wands.
The 38-block Times Square area was under heavy guard; hours before crowds
arrived police sealed manhole covers and removed garbage bins to guard
against explosives.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I have all this anti-terrorism stuff at the back of my mind,"
said Rose Masterson, who drove to New York from Connecticut with friends.
"But I wasn't going to let that stop me. You have to be able to live your
life. That's what tonight is about."</TE>
<TE>   There were more comfortable places to be in New York on an evening
when the windchill plunged temperatures into the low teens. But few
places were as festive or as hopeful.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why they came, people offered snapshots of New York's mood at
the end of a somber, traumatic year. Some said they had come expressly to
send the terrorists a message: "What I'd like to say to Osama bin Laden
is, 'In your face!' " said Kevin Buckley, a Bronx construction worker.
"You don't get away with that kind of destruction in my city. He doesn't
scare me, not at all."</TE>
<TE>   Others seemed introspective, hoping to honor the dead. As she posed
for a picture with a member of the New York Fire Department, Ruth
Petrovia said she couldn't ever forget the rescue workers who gave their
lives trying to save others. When the bells started ringing at 6 p.m. and
loudspeakers throughout Times Square boomed Aaron Copland's "Fanfare for
the Common Man," Petrovia said, "I had to wipe tears from my eyes. . . .
It's been such a sad year here."</TE>
<TE>   But most seemed to feel that coming to a boisterous public party on
the coldest night of the year was a sign that they were getting on with
their lives. John Brownlee, his face swathed in a New York Yankees ski
cap, stamped his feet to stay warm and joined his friends in an impromptu
dance to welcome in the new year. A blast of wind sent them scurrying for
cover in a storefront.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can't get excited on a night like this in Times Square, you
never will," he said. "I look at a place like this, and it's just one big
party. This is what we all need now."</TE>
<TE>   All around him, the huge neon signs advertising soft drinks, cars and
rock stars were interspersed with newer signs, many installed since Sept.
11. "United We Stand" and "God Bless America" shone brightly along with
photographs of rescue workers who died at the World Trade Center. Unlike
previous years, when most people in the crowd blew horns and wore
oversize goggles saluting the new year, many waved U.S. flags and wore
patriotic regalia.</TE>
<TE>   "My buddies and me spend every New Year's together, but this one was
special," said Matt Bochus, from Alabama, rubbing his hands together to
keep warm. "We took a ride down to ground zero [the site of the World

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Although the 2002 midterm congressional elections are still 10
months away, a combination of factors--from President Bush's soaring
popularity to candidate recruitment--are boosting Republican chances of
not only holding control of the House but also retaking the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Historically, the party in control of the White House tends to lose
seats in Congress two years after a president is elected.</LD>
<LD>   But this year's races now appear to be a tossup in the latest surveys,
Democratic and Republican strategists say.</LD>
<TE>   With control of both the House and Senate at stake, both parties are
preparing to pour massive funds into a few dozen contests and dispense
legislative favors to help shaky incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   The tight campaign also will ripple through the congressional agenda,
as lawmakers weigh competing pressures: whether to raise money and score
political points, or cut bipartisan deals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a year that can obviously go either way, depending
on the issues and where the country is in November," said Sen. Patty
Murray (D-Wash.), head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Several recent developments have favored Republicans as the party
seeks to win back what it briefly held at the outset of 2001: full
control of both the executive and legislative branches of government.</TE>
<TE>   In the House, the once-a-decade redrawing of 435 district lines to
account for population changes in the 2000 census now appears to have
favored incumbents to an unusual degree. Analysts say the GOP could pick
up one or two seats through the process. Those trends would likely
bolster the slim 222-211 House Republican majority.</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, an even slimmer 50-49-1 Democratic majority suffered a
string of year-end legislative embarrassments. Moreover, party insiders
say, Republicans were able to recruit polished candidates to challenge
vulnerable Democratic incumbents and compete for three open seats.</TE>
<TE>   Looming above both contests is President Bush, who has robust public
approval since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks made him a wartime
president.</TE>
<TE>   While those approval ratings are likely to fall at some point, the
doubts about the legitimacy and stature of the Republican president have
evaporated. So has the momentum Democrats gained after retaking the
Senate in June through a historic partisan defection, when James M.
Jeffords of Vermont left the Republican Party to become an independent.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush people are right now breathing a sigh of relief," said
Stuart Rothenberg, an independent Washington political analyst. "Compared
to six months earlier, they've got to be happy."</TE>
<TE>   A CNN/Gallup/USA Today poll tracking the 2002 congressional races
shows a Republican resurgence. In June, Democrats held a 50%-43% edge
among adults surveyed nationwide on their preferences for local
candidates. By December, the GOP had pulled slightly ahead, 46%-44%.</TE>
<TE>   Such generic polls are an imperfect gauge of the political dynamics in
Congress. The race for the Senate is really about 34 statewide contests.
And the race for the House amounts to 435 local matchups across the
country. Only a fraction in either case will be truly competitive.</TE>
<TE>   Any number of variables could yet swing back toward the Democrats
before next November--especially if the economy remains stagnant and
voters blame the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Cook, another independent Washington political analyst, said
the swirl of factors influencing the 2002 midterm elections is as
complicated as any he has ever seen: a broad but not necessarily deep
recession; a national groundswell of support for an unprecedented
anti-terrorism campaign; and the aftermath of the extraordinary dead-heat
election of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "You have currents on the surface, and then you have undercurrents,
and you don't know which ones are going to be dominant, which ones are
going to last and which aren't," Cook said. He believes Democrats have
lost a tactical edge since Sept. 11 but says the House and Senate races
are tossups.</TE>
<TE>   One current flowing against Republicans is history.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge now facing Bush is that no president has ever wrested
the Senate from an opposing party at the midterm since direct senatorial
elections began in 1914. In 22 midterm tests since then, the presidential
party gained ground in the Senate only four times--most recently in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   The trend is even more pronounced in the House. Since the Civil War,
the presidential party has lost seats in every midterm election except
1934 and 1998. The last Republican president to enjoy a GOP House
majority, Dwight D. Eisenhower, lost it for good two years into his first
term. The same befell President Clinton when the Democrats lost the House
in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   In 2002, much will depend on the size and shape of the House
battleground. For months, the two parties have skirmished over how states
will remap congressional districts. So far, the result is mainly a draw.</TE>
<TE>   In California, for example, redistricting is expected to help
Democrats add a seat. In Texas, Republicans are projected to gain two.</TE>
<TE>   In some states the fight has turned nasty. Democrats controlling the
redistricting process in Georgia redrew the lines to squeeze out two
Republicans and add as many as four seats favoring their party. Veteran
GOP Reps. Bob Barr and John Linder, for example, were pushed into the
same district.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans returned the favor in Michigan. There, Rep. David E.
Bonior--who for the last decade had been his party's whip--chose to run
for governor rather than face off against fellow Democrat Rep. Sander M.
Levin in a new district they now share. The new GOP-drawn map is
projected to help Republicans claim two new seats and strip Democrats of
three.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, most states are playing it safe. Incumbents of both parties
are getting help from the new maps. And that plays into Republican hands
if, as analysts suspect, only 50 or so races turn out to be in play and
maybe half of those become truly competitive. In previous decades,
reapportionment caused much more upheaval.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the gains Democrats need to make Rep. Richard A. Gephardt
of Missouri the next House speaker--at least six seats--could become
harder to achieve.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're the majority, that's where you want to be, having as few
contests as you can," said Rep. Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, who as
chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee is a top
party strategist.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats say they are poised to capitalize on Republican weaknesses
exposed in close House votes. Among them: an October vote for a GOP
economic stimulus plan loaded with corporate tax cuts; a November vote
opposing a plan to federalize airport security personnel; and a December
vote to grant Bush new power to negotiate international trade accords.</TE>
<TE>   One Republican, Rep. Robert "Robin" Hayes of North Carolina, who
represents a textile region vulnerable to competition from imports, was
tearful Dec. 6 as he switched his vote at the last minute to give Bush
the trade victory.</TE>
<TE>   "The House Republican leadership has done no favors for vulnerable
Republicans," said Jenny Backus, spokeswoman for the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, "and they've turned a deaf ear to
concerns of constituents in their districts."</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, a swing of just one seat to Republicans would strip
Democrats of the majority. On the surface, the numbers would favor the
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty of the 34 seats at stake are now held by the GOP. And while
Democratic incumbents are staying put, three Republicans are
retiring--Sens. Phil Gramm of Texas, Jesse Helms of North Carolina and
Strom Thurmond of South Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   But those three states are strongly pro-Bush, and analysts say only
about a half-dozen races are true tossups: Democratic seats in Minnesota,
South Dakota and Missouri, and Republican seats in Arkansas, New
Hampshire and perhaps Colorado. The GOP also has fielded a strong class
of candidates, headlined by Elizabeth Hanford Dole in North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   A key battleground is South Dakota, the home state of Senate Majority
Leader Tom Daschle. There, Democrats are defending Sen. Tim Johnson from
a GOP challenger recruited by the White House, Rep. John R. Thune. Bush
won the state in a landslide.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Daschle sought to aid Johnson and other Midwestern
Democrats with a bill to raise farm subsidies, but Republicans kept it
from coming to a vote. That followed other Democratic setbacks on
economic stimulus and homeland security legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "We like the way we're positioned," said Mitch Bainwol, executive
director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. "The hill was
steeper a year ago."</TE>

<HD>Another Losing Year for the Stock Market</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Back-to-back annual losses test investors' faith in
long-term returns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A strong rally since the terrorist attacks couldn't save the U.S.
stock market from recording its second consecutive losing year in 2001, a
historical rarity that last occurred more than a quarter century ago.</LD>
<LD>   The market's back-to-back losses in 2000 and 2001, reflecting first
the bursting of the technology bubble and then the economy's slide into
recession, may further challenge many investors' beliefs about the
long-term appeal of stocks, experts say.</LD>
<LD>   The blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 13% last year after
sliding 10% in 2000. Monday was the year's last trading day, a session
that saw the market close mixed.</LD>
<TE>   The last time the S&amp;P index and other key indexes fell for two
consecutive calendar years was 1973-74, during the first major
energy-price shock and the Watergate political scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in true Wall Street fashion, both optimists and pessimists have
seized upon the 2000-01 back-to-back losses to make their respective
cases about the market's potential performance in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   The bullish case is that a third straight year of decline would be
unprecedented since World War II and therefore highly unlikely, assuming
the economy recovers as most analysts expect sometime this year.</TE>
<TE>   The bearish case is that, despite the market's slide since 1999, many
stocks still trade at historically expensive levels relative to
companies' underlying earnings potential.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the market's doubters say, the decline hasn't yet
wrung out enough of the exuberance that powered the market to record
highs in the late '90s. By some historical measures, critics say, such
high-profile technology stocks as Cisco Systems and Yahoo are still very
expensive relative to the companies' earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, although two consecutive yearly losses are rare, Wall Street
rode a record winning streak between 1995 and 1999: The S&amp;P 500 index,
considered the benchmark performance measure for big-name stocks,
produced annual returns of more than 20% in each of those years, counting
price gain as well as dividends.</TE>
<TE>   That spectacular run boosted many investors' expectations for stock
returns over the long term, even though Wall Street pros continually
cautioned that the market's average annual gain since the mid-1920s was
about 11%, and that the late 1990s were more likely to be an anomaly than
the start of a new era of much higher returns.</TE>
<TE>   But by early 2000, investor optimism had reached frenzied levels amid
the technology stock mania. Individual investors poured record sums into
stock mutual funds in the first quarter of 2000, betting that the bull
market would roar ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the market overall peaked in March 2000. From its record high
that month, the S&amp;P 500 is down 25%. The tech-dominated Nasdaq composite
index has fared far worse: After losing 39.3% in 2000 and 21.1% last
year, Nasdaq is off 61% from its peak--despite a powerful rebound since
Sept. 21.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many small investors believe the market is capable of resuming
blistering gains over the long haul.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a November survey sponsored by mutual fund giant Vanguard
Group asked 500 participants in 401(k) retirement savings plans about
their market return assumptions. The survey found that respondents expect
the stock market to produce annual returns of about 7% over the next year
or two. But the median expectation for long-term annualized returns was
15%.</TE>
<TE>   Those high expectations raise the risk that more investors could
become disheartened by another extended slide in stocks or by returns
that are a shadow of what the market produced in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "As investors look to the future, they'll want to be very careful
about assuming that companies can resume anything like the kind of growth
rates common in the late 1990s," said Greg Smith, market strategist at
Prudential Financial in New York, in a recent report to clients.</TE>
<TE>   He and others say the corporate profit boom of that period was fueled
by a rare confluence of events, including falling interest rates, the
"peace dividend" from the end of the Cold War and the collapse of energy
prices.</TE>
<TE>   The stock market's performance isn't an abstract issue for many
Americans: If the market falls for a third year in 2002 or fails to rally
significantly in the next few years, it could change the financial
outlook for many people, given the trillions of dollars invested in
stocks in retirement plans and peoples' assumptions about how their
wealth will grow.</TE>
<TE>   A weak market also could become its own worst enemy, encouraging
investors to shift money to other assets, such as real estate. That's
what happened in the late 1970s: Though the S&amp;P index surged in 1975,
blue-chip stocks' performance in the late 1970s was relatively dismal,
and many people turned away from stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Karen Huber and Nathan Rosenberg, married Orange County
professionals, personify investors' mixed views of stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Huber, a clinical psychologist, won't invest new money in the market
now; Rosenberg won't invest anywhere else. Although they share a
household, they manage their funds separately.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg, a management consultant, had been out of stocks for more
than a year but invested all of his savings in the market Sept. 7--just a
few days before the terrorist attacks. Despite taking an immediate hit,
his portfolio has surged, and he's now "solidly up," he said. He
continues to pour more money in the market, believing that the economy is
on the mend.</TE>
<TE>   "My sense is that the economy is going to come back fairly strongly,"
he said. "I just funded my [retirement plan] today. Next week, that will
all go into stocks."</TE>
<TE>   Huber, meanwhile, said she isn't selling stocks, but she isn't buying,
either. She's investing money she recently inherited in real estate
rather than equity mutual funds.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want my money to be in something that I understand and that
I've seen work for me," Huber said.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street's bulls say the stock market's surge since Sept. 21 isn't
a fluke and is foretelling an economic recovery in 2002 that should
revive corporate profits and continue to drive share prices higher.</TE>
<TE>   After diving the week trading reopened after the attacks, the S&amp;P 500
has risen nearly 19%. The Nasdaq index has surged 37%.</TE>
<TE>   "Based upon the assumption that the U.S. will continue to be
successful in the war on terrorism, we believe the economy could begin a
significant expansion in 2002," said William D. Witter, manager of the
Enterprise Small Company Growth stock fund in New York.</TE>
<TE>   A key element of the bullish case is that the Federal Reserve is
expected to support stocks' advance by keeping short-term interest rates
at their current 40-year lows well into 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "With a tentative economy and inflation heading lower, the Fed would
have no reason to tighten credit" in the near future, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
economist Bruce Steinberg said recently.</TE>
<TE>   With money market mutual fund accounts bearing annualized yields of
less than 2%, investors will be inclined to turn to stocks as long as
they believe the economy will be growing again, many pros say.</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's, in its Outlook investment letter, told clients
recently to expect a double-digit gain in the S&amp;P 500 this year and
advised them to boost stocks to 65% of their total portfolio, up from a
previous guideline of 60%.</TE>
<TE>   But the certainty with which the majority of analysts now forecast an
economic upturn in 2002 worries some Wall Street veterans.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost nobody saw the recession coming [a year ago], but multitudes
believe they see it going," noted Grant's Interest Rate Observer in its
latest issue.</TE>
<TE>   And even with an economic rebound, the key question for many investors
is whether stock prices already reflect any corporate earnings recovery.</TE>
<TE>   The average blue-chip stock still is priced at more than 20 times
estimated 2002 earnings per share. That is far above the historical
average of about 13.5 times earnings.</TE>
<TE>   If corporate earnings turn out to be far better than expected in 2002,
stocks' price-to-earnings ratios aren't as high as they appear. But the
other way for those ratios to come down would be for stock prices to fall
further.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many market bulls say that, for a number of reasons, stocks
deserve to sell for above-average prices relative to earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "It is extremely naive to compare the P/E of stocks today to the
average of the recent past," said Edward Kerschner, investment strategist
at UBS Warburg in New York. Because interest rates and inflation are far
below historical norms, stocks should sell for more, he contends.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of a 2002 decline, investors could see the S&amp;P 500 index rise
as much as 37% this year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some small investors are holding back from that kind of optimism.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Frazier, a manufacturer's representative, said he has been
selectively buying--and selling--stocks recently but has pared back his
investing overall.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the market is going to be weird for a while, so I'm not as
active as I was," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Pollock, a professor of communications at the University of La
Verne, said his retirement savings got savaged in the market rout, which
made him more conservative. Still, he is keeping about half his total
portfolio in stocks.</TE>
<TE>   "I try not to let my short-term panic get in the way of my long-term
objectives," he said. "Long term, I'm optimistic. But, during the short
term, things are pretty uncertain."</TE>

<HD>Accord Near in Buenos Aires</HD>
<DH>S. America: Party leaders work to rescue Argentina from political
and economic turmoil. Senator emerges as the front-runner to assume
presidency for two years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<AU>VANESSA PETIT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>Leaders of several of Argentina's most important political parties
were close to an agreement Monday to form a "government of national
salvation" that would place a powerful senator in charge of this troubled
country for the next two years.</LD>
<LD>   A day after Argentina's third president in less than two weeks
resigned, Eduardo Duhalde, a senator from Buenos Aires province, was
emerging as the consensus candidate to become the leader of a nation
ravaged by political upheaval, economic collapse and violent street
protests.</LD>
<LD>   Duhalde was the Peronist party candidate who lost in the 1999
elections to Fernando de la Rua, the Radical Party leader who resigned
Dec. 20 after weeks of rioting and demonstrations by Argentines angered
by his economic policies, which included budget cuts and strict banking
restrictions.</LD>
<TE>   "Today, the most logical thing to do is to choose an experienced man,"
said Carlos Ruckauf, the governor of Buenos Aires province, referring to
Duhalde. The two men have long been intense rivals within the Peronist
party, which is the largest in both houses of Congress and the ruling
party in most of Argentina's provinces.</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear late Monday whether Duhalde would accept the offer.
An extraordinary session of Congress is scheduled for today to elect a
new president to fill the vacancy left by Adolfo Rodriguez Saa, who
stepped down Sunday after holding the post for less than a week.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday afternoon, as most Argentines prepared for New Year's Eve
parties, several leading Peronist politicians were gathered in Duhalde's
home in Lomas de Zamora, a Buenos Aires suburb.</TE>
<TE>   The negotiations came amid a climate of extraordinary social tension
and uncertainty across this nation of 37 million people. Squads of
federal and local police were posted at key points in the center of this
capital city, the scene of recent street battles.</TE>
<TE>   For the New Year's holiday, the government allowed a one-time
withdrawal of $500 from each banking account, and Argentines formed long
lines at banks. Many were concerned that their deposits might soon be
frozen or that Argentina's currency, the peso, might suddenly be
devalued. Already, the peso is considered worthless in Chile and other
neighboring countries, where most businesses and exchange houses refuse
to accept it.</TE>
<TE>   "The system is collapsing," said Analia Castilla, 24, as she waited in
line at a Buenos Aires bank. Last Friday, she had waited seven hours in
an unsuccessful attempt to collect her paycheck. (Many salaries here are
deposited directly into bank accounts.)</TE>
<TE>   "Today I came to see what would happen," Castilla said. "I need my
money."</TE>
<TE>   It remained unclear Monday whether a new government--whoever leads
it--would continue the dramatic economic measures announced last week by
Rodriguez. The interim president had promised that he would not devalue
the national currency, the peso, and said the government would issue a
new currency, the argentino, to pay government salaries, pensions and
other government outlays.</TE>
<TE>   If Duhalde were to assume the presidency, it would be thanks to a
compromise between the Peronists and their chief rivals, the Radical
Party and the center-left Frepaso.</TE>
<TE>   After De la Rua's fall, the Peronists had wanted to appoint an interim
president until March, when elections would be held to choose a new
leader to complete De la Rua's term. But members of the Radical Party and
Frepaso said the nation's unstable social climate made fair elections
impossible.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be better to have elections, but Argentina wouldn't make it
to election day," said Anibal Ibarra, the mayor of Buenos Aires and
leader of Frepaso. "Even if it's only once, all the [political] factions
should unite behind" the plan of a coalition government.</TE>
<TE>   Federico Sotrani, a congressional deputy representing the Radical
Party, said his party would support a Duhalde presidency but was still
debating whether it would join a government of national unity.</TE>
<TE>   The political negotiations Monday night followed weeks of social chaos
and political vacuums. Since De la Rua announced a series of banking
restrictions in early December--including a $250 weekly limit on
withdrawals--Cabinet ministers have resigned in the wee hours of the
morning, while looters have sacked hundreds of grocery stores and other
businesses. Thousands of middle-class Argentines have taken to street
corners to beat pots and pans.</TE>
<TE>   From his ranch in Crawford, Texas, President Bush expressed concern
over the country's instability.</TE>
<TE>   "Once they elect a president, we'll work with him," Bush said. "But
the future president has got to deal with the economic crisis at hand.
And once they come up with a plan that will sustain economic growth, then
we're willing to work with them."</TE>
<TE>   Argentina's latest head of state was Eduardo Camano, the president of
the lower house of Congress. He took the oath of office Monday to serve
for just a few hours before today's congressional session to choose the
interim leader.</TE>
<TE>   When interim president Rodriguez resigned, Camano had been third in
line for the presidency: The office of vice president is vacant, and the
head of the Senate, Ramon Puerta, quit his post rather than assume the
presidency late Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Puerta had held the presidency for less than 48 hours after De la Rua
resigned and before Rodriguez was named interim leader.</TE>
<TE>   Camano had words of praise for the man who may, or may not, become
Argentina's newest president today.</TE>
<TE>   "Duhalde has strong support among important sectors of Peronism and
the rest of the political spectrum," Camano said. "I would feel good if
he came to be the candidate."</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde is a controversial figure who rose through the ranks of the
Peronists after being elected mayor of Lomas de Zamora in 1983. From 1989
to 1991, he was vice president to Carlos Menem, the charismatic president
who later spent several months under house arrest on arms trafficking
charges.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde was also governor of Buenos Aires province, infamous here for
police and judicial corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Not all members of the Peronists, officially known as the Justicialist
Party, said they were prepared to accept a Duhalde presidency until 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a great deal of respect for Mr. Duhalde, but I think that we
are making a grave mistake," said Jose Manuel De la Sota, the Peronist
governor of Cordoba province. "The best way to have a government of
national salvation is for each Argentine to choose a path with his vote.
We can't have four or five politicians choosing for us."</TE>
<TE>   In his resignation speech Sunday, Rodriguez singled out De la Sota for
criticism, saying the governor was placing his own political ambitions
before those of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   But De la Sota was only one of several Peronist leaders vying to
become Argentina's next president in the wake of the collapse of De la
Rua's government. And other Peronist governors were insisting, like him,
that Argentina needed to go ahead with elections in March.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Denies Report That Raid Killed Villagers</HD>
<DH>War: Afghans tell BBC that 100 civilians died in bombing, but
Pentagon says airstrike hit Taliban compound. American forces take
custody of more prisoners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>American forces were accused Monday of bombing Afghan civilians by
mistake, and defense officials emphatically denied the claim.</LD>
<LD>   The strike early Saturday about five to 10 miles northwest of Gardiz,
the capital of Paktia province, destroyed a Taliban compound, but not
before two surface-to-air missiles were fired from the site at U.S.
warplanes, said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Matthew Klee, a spokesman for the U.S.
Central Command in Tampa, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   "This was not a village. It was a known Taliban and Al Qaeda
leadership compound," Klee said of the strike, in which one B-52 and two
B-1B bombers dropped precision-guided munitions.</LD>
<TE>   "We looked at this location for an extended period of time. It wasn't
like it was something that just popped up on the horizon that we shot
at."</TE>
<TE>   But residents of the village of Qalaye Niazi, just outside Gardiz,
were quoted in British Broadcasting Corp. reports as saying that more
than 100 residents were killed and many homes destroyed in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   There was no confirmation of the village bombing report. Klee said one
of the U.S. bombs triggered a series of secondary explosions, apparently
confirming the suspicion of military intelligence analysts that
explosives and munitions were stored at the site.</TE>
<TE>   The surface-to-air missiles fired in the direction of U.S. warplanes
during the strike originated from within the compound, Klee said. He said
neither missile came close to hitting its mark.</TE>
<TE>   "All the bombs struck the intended target," Klee said. "We struck what
we targeted and nothing else."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the number of suspected Taliban or Al Qaeda prisoners in
U.S. custody continued to mount. U.S. forces took custody of 30 more
Monday, said Maj. Cynthia Colin, a Pentagon spokeswoman; 25 were taken to
a detention site in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan. A total of 180
prisoners are now in U.S. custody.</TE>
<TE>   The prisoners handed over were among the estimated 3,000 suspected
Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters being held by anti-Taliban Afghan forces.
U.S. military interrogators have been working to identify the prisoners.
Those shifted to U.S. custody represent an apparently elite group of
mostly Arabs.</TE>
<TE>   In Crawford, Texas, President Bush commented on the war effort.</TE>
<TE>   "The definition of success is making sure the Taliban is out of
existence, helping rebuild Afghanistan and disrupting this international
terrorist network. I think we're doing a darn good job of it too."</TE>
<TE>   Bush said there was no new information on the whereabouts of Osama Bin
Laden, whom the United States blames for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
or Mullah Mohammed Omar, who headed the Taliban regime that harbored Bin
Laden and ruled much of Afghanistan from 1996 until it crumbled during
the last two months under a U.S. military onslaught.</TE>
<TE>   "He's running, and any time you get a person running, it means you're
going to get him pretty soon," Bush said of Bin Laden. "I'm patient and
so is our military."</TE>
<TE>   Defense officials denied an Associated Press report Monday that
helicopters carrying U.S. Marines in full combat gear were headed
northwest from Kandahar to support an operation aimed at capturing or
killing Omar.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no Marines going anywhere today from Kandahar or anywhere
else," said Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Klee said a helicopter carrying a rapid-reaction force did leave the
Kandahar base about 10:30 p.m. Monday to rescue a team of U.S. commandos
that came under fire near Jalalabad in northeastern Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   That is about the same time that Marines cited in the AP report
reportedly left Kandahar, and that could have led to confusion by
observers, Klee said.</TE>
<TE>   One member of the commando team was shot in the leg in the incident
near Jalalabad, Klee said. He said the commandos were driving in a
nonmilitary car in an area that has been plagued by bandits and highway
robbers in recent weeks. It was unclear who fired the shots, Klee said.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the reinforcements arrived, Klee said, the shooters had
fled. He said the wounded commando was taken to a medical facility.</TE>
<TE>   The accusations by Afghan villagers and the denial from the Pentagon
mirror a similar episode about a week ago, also in southeastern
Afghanistan, in which the U.S. was accused of bombing a convoy containing
tribal elders on their way to the ceremony installing the new interim
government led by Hamid Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   About 65 people were killed in that attack, and Karzai told tribal
elders that he would ask the Americans to cut back their raids in the
region. The Pentagon has insisted that the convoy was a legitimate target
containing senior Taliban leaders. But Quigley, the Pentagon spokesman,
acknowledged Friday that other people who were not associated with the
Taliban might have been in the convoy as well.</TE>
<TE>   Other Afghan government ministers have said that the United States
should stop its bombing altogether. Karzai, however, has refrained from
such broad declarations, perhaps signaling his recognition that the
ongoing hunt for Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders means select targets in
Afghanistan will still come under attack.</TE>
<TE>   In Kandahar, Marines continued preparations to hand over the air base
there to soldiers from the Army's 101st Airborne Division, paving the way
for a long-term U.S. military presence in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The Army troops from Ft. Campbell, Ky., will take over operations at
the makeshift base at the Kandahar airport, where more than 1,000 Marines
have been preparing runways for humanitarian flights, building facilities
to hold hundreds of detainees and searching for remaining Taliban
fighters holed up near Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines being replaced are part of two expeditionary units based
on amphibious assault ships now in the northern Arabian Sea off the coast
of Pakistan. They are trained and equipped for short, 30-day missions,
whereas the 101st, one of the Army's lightest, quickest forces, is
typically used for longer-term missions.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines will not necessarily leave the region soon and may be
assigned to other missions in the war against terrorism, said Lt. Col.
Mike Humm, a Pentagon spokesman.</TE>

<HD>Global Hawk Crashes in Afghanistan in a Setback for High-Tech
Drones</HD>
<DH>Intelligence: Loss points up reliance on complex but relatively
untested craft that are sensitive to weather and other factors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>An unmanned U.S. spy aircraft has crashed in Afghanistan, U.S.
military officials said Monday, in a reminder that one of the most
important new technologies in the war against terrorism is fragile and
only partially developed.</LD>
<LD>   The RQ-4A Global Hawk that crashed during a routine flight Sunday was
rushed into the theater in November to help U.S. forces track enemy
fighters. Pentagon officials say the Global Hawk and the older,
lower-flying RQ-1 Predator drone will be central to their effort to track
down Islamic militants in South Asia and around the world.</LD>
<LD>   But the crash, which occurred for reasons that were still unclear
Monday, means U.S. forces have already lost one of two Global Hawks they
had in the theater. Several Predators have also crashed in surveillance
missions in Afghanistan and Iraq since the war began, analysts say.</LD>
<TE>   The losses come at a time when Pentagon officials have already
expressed concern that their worldwide anti-terror campaign will be
crimped by the limited availability of the surveillance aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. military officials at Central Command in Tampa, Fla., which is
overseeing the war, said the Global Hawk crashed about midday Sunday as
it was returning from a routine patrol in or around Afghanistan. They
said the crash was not the result of enemy fire, but declined to provide
other details.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a long history of crashes and high costs, unmanned
reconnaissance planes have become an increasingly attractive technology
to the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   At a time of growing emphasis on battlefield intelligence gathering
and precision bombing, these remotely controlled craft offer commanders
detailed, real-time images from flights that last dozens of hours or even
days.</TE>
<TE>   The Predator, which can stay aloft for nearly 24 hours, carries radar
that functions through cloud cover along with infrared sensors that can
generate images in low light. Predator video cameras have transmitted
live feeds to AC-130 gunship crews, enabling them to find and destroy
targets on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   The Predators, which fly up to 140 mph at altitudes up to about 25,000
feet, have also been modified to carry Hellfire heat-seeking missiles.</TE>
<TE>   The 44-foot-long Global Hawk flies far higher, for a wider view of the
landscape. It can reach altitudes above 60,000 feet yet can produce still
images that allow analysts to distinguish one tire track from another.</TE>
<TE>   Its speed of 400 mph and its high altitude put it out of range of
enemy fire.</TE>
<TE>   With these capabilities in mind, President Bush last month cited the
Predator and the Global Hawk as examples of the kind of
"transformational" defense technologies whose development the Pentagon
needs to accelerate.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the planes have weaknesses.</TE>
<TE>   The Predator's relatively slow speed and low altitude make it
vulnerable to enemy fire. At its lower altitudes, it also accumulates ice
on the wings, thus making it unsuitable for use in northern Afghanistan
during the winter.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Thomas P. Christie, director of the Pentagon's office of
operational test and evaluation, issued a report citing several
shortcomings of the Predator. He said the drone had "poor target location
accuracy," broke down too often, had ineffective communications and was
hampered in intelligence gathering even by "relatively benign weather."</TE>
<TE>   "It cannot operate in less than ideal weather," Christie said.</TE>
<TE>   About one-third of the 60 Predators that have been built have crashed,
analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   The Global Hawk also has limits. Although its altitude puts it out of
range of enemy fire, the plane is too high for video cameras to be used.</TE>
<TE>   Though Air Force officials praise the Global Hawk's flight performance
to date, they also acknowledge that the plane's development is at a
relatively early stage. It is manufactured by Northrop Grumman Corp. and
assembled in Palmdale.</TE>
<TE>   In an illustration of the plane's vulnerability to human error, a
Global Hawk prototype crashed at China Lake Naval Weapons Center in May
1999 when it was unintentionally sent an electronic signal to terminate
the flight, illustrating the plane's vulnerability to human error.</TE>
<TE>   John Pike, a defense and intelligence specialist at the research group
http://GlobalSecurity.org, said the Global Hawk, while not known to have
any particular performance problems, also has a relatively short test
flight history.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld offered favorable comments last
month about the Global Hawk's performance in the war. But he noted that
its use in the theater had been limited.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz acknowledged last month
that the Pentagon needs to buy more drones and figure out how best to use
them.</TE>
<TE>   "We're learning we don't have enough of them, and we're still ironing
out the bugs in terms of how to make best use of them," Wolfowitz said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he said, the Defense Department will substantially
boost funding for development of the drones, and he suggested that the
Pentagon had been remiss in not moving more swiftly on the program.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say the shortage of [drones] is a wake-up call," Wolfowitz
said.</TE>

<HD>Hart Office Building Fumigation Completed</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Workers finished fumigating the Hart Senate Office Building and
should know within a week whether they successfully removed deadly
anthrax spores delivered in a tainted letter in mid-October.</LD>
<LD>   Environmental Protection Agency spokeswoman Jennifer Browne said
contractors finished releasing chlorine dioxide gas into the building's
ventilation system around 2:30 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward, crews collected "spore strips" covered with harmless test
bacteria that should "tell us how effective we were in the fumigation
process," Browne said.</LD>
<TE>   The anthrax attacks hit the nation's capital Oct. 15 with the delivery

<HD>Value of Grounded Osprey Aircraft Expected to Warrant Postwar Look</HD>
<DH>Military: Marines say the conflict in Afghanistan points up the
advantages of the controversial V-22, even though it saw no action there.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MANAMA, Bahrain
</DL>
<LD>With the U.S. campaign in Afghanistan winding down, the inevitable
"after-action" analysis is underway in military circles to determine
which weapons and strategies worked and which did not.</LD>
<LD>   But the Marine Corps is also hoping the Afghanistan operation will
help make a case for an aircraft that saw no action there: the
controversial tilt-rotor V-22 Osprey, designed to land and take off like
a helicopter but fly like a fixed-wing airplane.</LD>
<LD>   The Osprey is meant to fly faster, farther, higher and with a heavier
cargo load than older helicopters. Marine officials say those factors
could be crucial in future missions like the one in Afghanistan, in which
thousands of troops and tons of cargo were moved into hostile territory
several hundred miles from support ships.</LD>
<TE>   "The environment in which we're operating in Afghanistan points out
the advantage of an aircraft such as the tilt-rotor V-22," said Maj. Rick
Long, spokesman at Marine Corps headquarters in Quantico, Va. "You have a
country that on its low end is almost a mile high and in the mountains
rises to 18,000 to 19,000 feet. Those are hard altitudes for [existing]
helicopters to operate in."</TE>
<TE>   The Osprey fleet was grounded a year ago after two crashes killed 23
Marines. The program later was snared in scandal when eight officers,
including a two-star general, were accused in the falsification of
maintenance records to keep the program from being canceled. Six were
cleared, including the general.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Corps has stuck stubbornly with the V-22 program.
Commandant Gen. James Jones and his wife took a highly publicized flight
in an Osprey last year to attest to its safety.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 21, the Defense Department announced it will resume test
flights in April to see if the design problems that may have contributed
to the two deadly crashes have been fixed.</TE>
<TE>   Marine Corps officials say that the Osprey is needed to replace the
aging fleet of CH-46 Sea Knight and CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters.
Workhorse designs from the Vietnam era, many of the helicopters have
undergone extensive upgrades, an expensive process to extend their
usefulness.</TE>
<TE>   The Sea Knights and Sea Stallions were successfully used to resupply
Marine outposts at Camp Rhino and the bombed-out Kandahar airport in
southern Afghanistan. But they required a complex system of refueling and
were forced to fly through valleys where Taliban and Al Qaeda soldiers
were known to be equipped with shoulder-launched Stinger missiles. The
Osprey could have flown higher and without refueling, the Marines say.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Ospreys were grounded in December of last year, the Marine
Corps had taken delivery of 20. The initial goal had been for the Corps
to buy 360, the Air Force 50 and the Navy 48 under a $40-billion
acquisition program.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the Osprey program cite safety as their main concern, but
any expensive military acquisition also needs political support. When he
was defense secretary in the first Bush administration, for example, Vice
President Dick Cheney opposed the Osprey because of cost and technology
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   As the Osprey program again becomes a topic of discussion in
Washington, references to Afghanistan are expected to be common.</TE>
<TE>   "That bird was made for the Rhino mission--deep, over-the-horizon kind
of stuff," said one Marine officer in Afghanistan.</TE>

<HD>Bush Assembles Diplomatic Team to Aid Transition</HD>
<DH>Envoys: Zalmay Khalilzad, the highest-ranking Afghan and Muslim in
the U.S. government, is named to lead the effort.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>With the Afghan government now in place, the United States has
lined up its new diplomatic team for Kabul to help oversee the critical
two-year transition period.</LD>
<LD>   It will be headed by Zalmay Khalilzad, the highest-ranking Muslim and
Afghan in the U.S. government, the White House announced Monday.
Khalilzad, who is special assistant to the president and senior director
for Near East affairs on the National Security Council, will be the new
special presidential envoy to Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   The position was created to underscore President Bush's support as
Afghans "seek to consolidate a new order, reconstruct their country and
free it from Al Qaeda and Taliban control," according to a White House
statement.</LD>
<TE>   Khalilzad heads a team that will play an increasingly important role
as the focus of U.S. intervention shifts from the war front to
stabilizing the fragile post-Taliban government and preventing
long-standing political rivalries from disintegrating into civil war. The
posts will be among the most sensitive--and dangerous--in the U.S.
foreign service.</TE>
<TE>   Khalilzad, who was also considered for the job of ambassador to
Afghanistan, played a crucial behind-the-scenes role during talks in Bonn
among disparate Afghan warlords, tribal leaders and ethnic groups as the
United Nations brokered a deal to set up the first post-Taliban
government. He was pivotal in convincing holdouts to sign on to the U.N.
proposals for a staged transition that embraced all aspects of Afghan
society, according to U.S. and U.N. officials.</TE>
<TE>   Khalilzad is expected to play a similar role in the political
transition. He will travel to the region and consult with U.N. officials
as needed. But he will be based in Washington, and the new assignment
will be in addition to his National Security Council duties at the White
House, according to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Finn, the former U.S. ambassador to Tajikistan, is a leading
candidate to be the new ambassador to Afghanistan, according to U.S.
officials. Tajikistan shares a strategic border with Afghanistan, and the
second-largest ethnic group in Afghanistan is Tajik. The leadership of
the Northern Alliance, the opposition force that helped oust the Taliban
and is strongly represented in the new government, is also heavily Tajik.
Finn, a career diplomat, also served in Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever is nominated must be confirmed by the Senate, and that could
take several weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Ryan Crocker, former U.S. ambassador to Syria, Kuwait
and Lebanon, will be assigned to Kabul as charge d'affaires. He may leave
for the Afghan capital as early as this week, according to State
Department sources. Crocker is expected to be in Kabul for two to three
months until the ambassadorial appointment is finalized.</TE>
<TE>   Crocker has long experience in war zones and crises from decades in
the Middle East. He and his wife were in the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in
1983 when it was bombed by Muslim militants. He also served in Baghdad
and is deputy assistant secretary of State for Near East affairs, with
particular focus on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say the appointments signal a strong ongoing commitment to
war-ravaged Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "We intend to remain engaged in Afghanistan. We intend to work with
the interim authority throughout the transition to a broad-based
government," a State Department official said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Troops Usher In New Year in Subdued Wartime Lighting</HD>
<DH>War: At a support base in Afghanistan, personnel focus on tasks at
hand and take little notice as 2002 arrives.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The C-130 transport appeared out of the New Year's Eve darkness so
quickly after its steep descent that it was touching down almost before
anyone realized it had arrived. Its lights off, the plane braked hard on
the pavement, dropped its rear cargo door and expelled a handful of
soldiers seen only by the red and green light of the Cyalume glow sticks
they carried.</LD>
<LD>   The sticks swirled. Giant forklifts sped in. And the craft's massive
belly was emptied and then refilled in precisely 19 minutes, its engines
never stopping their howl. It then lifted back into the night.</LD>
<LD>   "Pretty fast, eh," said Air Force Lt. Mike Johnson. "The longer
they're on the ground, the more vulnerable they are."</LD>
<TE>   It had begun two nights before when antiaircraft fire greeted the
commander of the Air Force's Tanker Airlift Control Element, or TALCE.
Since arriving, troops had hardly had time to notice as one of the most
trying years in modern United States history drew to a close.</TE>
<TE>   An Army demolition expert had lost a foot to unexploded ordnance
nearby, as had a British soldier. Still, the C-130s, C-17s and Chinook
helicopters were coming in fast, landing hard and racing around among
pickup trucks, oversized forklifts, pallets of supplies and sentries
scanning the horizon with night-vision goggles.</TE>
<TE>   There was a burst of activity, and then they were gone, and then there
were more--all of the craft coddled by the TALCE, an expeditionary unit
that can deploy to anywhere in the world within 12 hours and take care of
itself without backup for weeks. TALCE's task is to oversee or, as in
this case, build nearly from scratch, an airport.</TE>
<TE>   They do the weather forecasts, they do the radar, they offload and
upload and guide the aircraft in and out. TALCE members know that the
special operations guys, the Marines at the embassy and the Army's 10th
Mountain Division across the way get more credit. They also know that all
those other units would have a very hard time doing their jobs without
support.</TE>
<TE>   An hour outside Kabul, Bagram has quickly become the port of promise
for a new Afghanistan, the landing zone for everyone from Japanese
politicians coming to meet the interim prime minister to missionaries
bringing Bibles and rice.</TE>
<TE>   On New Year's Eve, however, it was clear that despite the defeat of
the Taliban government and the flight of many of Osama bin Laden's Al
Qaeda fighters, Bagram is still very much a military base in the middle
of a war. Many of those at the base learned that 2002 had arrived when
some Afghans in the hills to the west marked the occasion by firing their
AK-47s into the air, the red tracer bullets arcing with dangerous beauty
through the night.</TE>
<TE>   There were no other fireworks to mark the beginning of 2002. The Army
ordnance disposal folks offered a pre-holiday show last week, however,
when they gathered together a number of unexploded shells and bombs and
blew them up, sending three rockets whistling through the air, along with
an eye-widening rain of shrapnel.</TE>
<TE>   There were no mirror balls or light shows. The few safe paths here,
one of the most heavily mined areas in this heavily mined country, are
marked with Cyalumes, the modern military equivalent of the lantern, but
much dimmer. No white lights are allowed at night, so troops find their
way with the help of the glowing plastic rods and even dimmer red-lensed
flashlights.</TE>
<TE>   So many unexploded mines and cluster bombs, grenades and rockets are
sprinkled throughout the area that residents, wanting to be helpful, have
shown up at Air Force and Army encampments to hand over explosives they
have found. (The Americans are now printing leaflets asking residents to
simply report the devices, not deliver them.) An unexploded hand grenade
was found just yards from the air traffic control tower--a building, like
virtually every other in the area, that has been shelled, shot and
rocketed almost into oblivion during 2 1/2 decades of war.</TE>
<TE>   "Sir, please walk on the hardball," said 19-year-old Pfc. Andrew
Kosterman of Racine, Wis., when a civilian edged close to the edge of the
pavement.</TE>
<TE>   They had New Year's plans, though, these airmen and soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   The base here is dry, no alcohol, but Air Force Capt. Anthony Babcock,
27, of New Orleans was sending a few of his men home. "I'm in the process
of trying to procure some vodka for my troops," he said with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   The Army folks bought a cow and had the local rancher slaughter it.
The Air Force TALCE commander, Lt. Col. Phil Bossert, had his medic go
over to check on the bovine's condition before agreeing to have it
grilled for 12 hours before serving it.</TE>
<TE>   A native New Yorker, Bossert pulled out two photographs as the new
year approached. One was of his two children. The other was of
firefighters raising an American flag atop the rubble of the World Trade
Center.</TE>
<TE>   "To remember why we're here," he said, seemingly referring to both.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Revelers thronged the streets of major world cities early today,
welcoming a new year they hoped will see greater security and an end to
2001's economic woes.</LD>
<LD>   In Australia, an estimated 1 million spectators ignored a shroud of
acrid smoke over Sydney to throng the harbor for a fireworks celebration
billed as one of the world's largest pyrotechnic displays.</LD>
<LD>   The festivities came as authorities continued to battle some of the
most destructive bush fires the country has seen in decades.</LD>
<TE>   In Tokyo, Buddhist priests in black robes rang temple bells and
clasped their hands in prayer at midnight.</TE>
<TE>   In England, the archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, said the
deadly suicide hijackings of Sept. 11 had left people around the world
feeling "weak and pretty powerless." But he also said the "heroic deeds"
of rescuers such as firefighters had shown everyone that "facing death,
many spoke words of love."</TE>
<TE>   London was suffering the same cold winter temperatures as much of

<HD>South Asia's Mood Seems Less Warlike</HD>
<DH>Face-off: As Pakistan takes 20 militants into custody, India
expresses satisfaction. But New Delhi is likely to want more such moves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>After days of saber-rattling and a buildup of Indian and Pakistani
forces in Kashmir, tensions in the disputed Himalayan territory appeared
to slightly ease Monday with Pakistan's arrest of 20 anti-India militants
and its promise to continue the crackdown.</LD>
<LD>   The key figure in custody was Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, whom India has
accused of involvement in a Dec. 13 suicide attack on its Parliament in
New Delhi. He was arrested Sunday at a meeting in Islamabad and charged
with inciting people to violence.</LD>
<LD>   Until last week, Saeed led Lashkar-e-Taiba, one of two major guerrilla
groups fighting India in Kashmir. The other group's leader, Maulana
Masood Azhar of Jaish-e-Mohammed, was arrested last week. Pakistan has
frozen the bank accounts of both organizations. Saeed and Azhar have
denied any involvement in the attack that killed 14 people, including the
five gunmen.</LD>
<TE>   India welcomed the latest development, saying it was "a step in the
right direction." But it probably did not go far enough to completely
satisfy New Delhi, which wants accused terrorists extradited and
guerrilla training camps in Kashmir shut down. New Delhi is said to have
a list of other suspects it wants arrested.</TE>
<TE>Shooting Continues in Contested Region</TE>
<TE>   Although Western diplomats said the arrests and India's positive
response could be the start of a diplomatic breakthrough, firing
continued Monday across the so-called Line of Control that divides
Kashmir. Two Indian soldiers, two Pakistani soldiers and nine
pro-Pakistani militants were reported killed.</TE>
<TE>   The two nuclear-armed nations have hundreds of thousands of troops in
Kashmir, the battlefield for two wars between India and Pakistan since
the end of British rule in 1947. Both sides have said they will not
resort to the use of nuclear weapons, but Pakistani Foreign Minister
Abdus Sattar has said the situation is so tense that he fears some
unintended move by one side or the other could lead the crisis to spin
out of control.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf made a direct appeal to the
Indian people Sunday, saying Pakistan does not want war but would not shy
away from meeting military challenges. He earlier said that if India
proved Pakistani involvement in the Dec. 13 attack, he would take action
against those responsible.</TE>
<TE>   "We are making every effort to avoid war," Aziz Khan, the Pakistani
Foreign Ministry spokesman, told the BBC on Monday. "We don't want war.
We hope good sense will prevail--and that the problems will be settled
through dialogue."</TE>
<TE>   The United States is exerting intense diplomatic pressure on both
sides to avoid bloodshed on the subcontinent, in part because Pakistan
and India are important allies in the war on terrorism. Musharraf and
India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, are scheduled to attend an
Asian summit in Nepal later this week, and Washington hopes the two sides
will use the occasion to open a dialogue, at least on a ministerial
level.</TE>
<TE>Attack Gave It Right to Respond, India Says</TE>
<TE>   India contends that it has a right to respond to the attack on its
Parliament, just as the United States did to the Sept. 11 attacks in New
York and on the Pentagon. In reply to Washington's call for calm,
Vajpayee said, "We have exercised enough restraint." The United States
last week added Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed to its list of
international terrorist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan, which previously supported Afghanistan's Taliban regime,
switched policy after Sept. 11 and joined the coalition against
terrorism, providing the United States with intelligence and military
facilities. Government officials said Monday that the arrests of Saeed
and his supporters were part of Pakistan's ongoing efforts against
terrorism rather than a direct response to India's demands to bring the
Parliament attackers to justice.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush called Vajpayee and Musharraf on Saturday, and the
White House suggested that he had taken a firm approach with the
Pakistani leader while telling the Indian that the United States
empathized with his country after the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "In my conversation with the prime minister, I said I can understand
how he feels. If someone attacked the U.S. Capitol, I'd feel angry too,"
Bush told reporters Monday at his ranch in Crawford, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   However, he said he also told Vajpayee that while he understood the
Indians' anger, "I was hoping that they were not headed for war."</TE>
<TE>   The president specifically mentioned the arrests Monday, on top of
previous arrests of guerrilla figures, and said of Musharraf, "He's
cracking down hard, and I appreciate his efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "Terror is terror," Bush said, "and the fact that the Pakistani
president is after terrorism is a good sign."</TE>

<KH>REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK</KH>
<HD>Meanwhile, Back at the Ranch . . .</HD>
<DH>President: Bush reflects on a year in which much changed. He
concludes that his joy at returning home is a constant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas
</DL>
<LD>His father always grew testy when interviewers tried to delve into
his psyche.</LD>
<LD>   "Don't put me on the couch," the first President Bush would say.</LD>
<LD>   And so it was not peculiar that the second President Bush might get
his back up the other day when a reporter asked whether the events of his
first year in the White House had changed him.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't spend a lot of time looking in the mirror. Except when I comb
my hair," the president said. (Indeed, Bush--clad in a comfortably worn
jacket--didn't appear to have spent hours primping.)</TE>
<TE>   A note of irritation in his words, he offered this hint: "I liked
coming to the ranch before Sept. 11; I like coming to the ranch after
Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, no change.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 346 days of his presidency, Bush has spent all or part of 58
days at the ranch, on nine trips. It is where he came to prepare for his
first major foreign trip, and where he came for rest afterward. He made a
point of bringing Russian President Vladimir V. Putin to the ranch in
November.</TE>
<TE>   He toured the 1,600-acre ranch Friday with Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the
military architect of the war in Afghanistan and a native of Midland,
Texas, a town far to the west where Bush also passed his early years.</TE>
<TE>   And the ranch is where he passed New Year's Eve.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to an early evening tonight," he confided to
reporters Monday. "I guess at the age of 55, it's OK for a guy to go to
bed at about 9 p.m., maybe 10 p.m. So I don't plan anything glamorous for
New Year's Eve."</TE>
<TE>   In a caravan of black Chevrolet Suburbans, the president left the
ranch Monday for lunch at the Coffee Station, the coffee shop and gas
station at the blinking-stoplight intersection that is downtown Crawford.
Perhaps 50 people--among them a visitor from Max, N.D., and a young girl
on horseback--gathered across the street in front of the grain elevator.
They drew a presidential wave, but no handshakes.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the president said to reporters, "2002 . . . is going to be a
great year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a great year because people are going to be able to
find work again. It's going to be a great year because our military is
going to do the job the Americans expect."</TE>
<TE>   But mostly, he said, his forecast was sunny because "Americans have
taken a look inward, reassessed their values, have realized that some of
the basics in life are that which is most important--love of faith, love
of family.</TE>
<TE>   "So I'm really looking forward to 2002. I'm also looking forward to my
cheeseburger."</TE>
<TE>   Any resolutions for the new year?</TE>
<TE>   "Eat fewer cheeseburgers," the president promised.</TE>
<TE>   When the president arrived in Texas on the day after Christmas, he was
accompanied by his wife, Laura; his mother-in-law, Jenna Welch; his
springer spaniel, Spot, straining at the leash; his Scottish terrier,
Barney, tucked as usual under a presidential arm; and the family cat,
India, in a plastic carrying case.</TE>
<TE>   Friends from Lubbock and Austin were expected for the abbreviated New
Year's Eve celebration, the president said Monday. Twin daughters Barbara
and Jenna had spent Christmas with the family at Camp David, Md., but did
not continue on to the isolated ranch, White House aides said.</TE>
<TE>   The days are a melange of rest and work, both physical and official.</TE>
<TE>   "I was up this morning at 5 a.m., spent a little quality time with the
first lady. And I just finished my book, 'Theodore Rex' by Edmund Morris,
which is a fabulous book on Teddy Roosevelt," Bush said last week.</TE>
<TE>   Monday, he said he spent three hours "in the canyons cleaning
underbrush."</TE>
<TE>   The president has planted about 35 trees on Prairie Chapel Ranch,
about a 10-minute drive from town. The most recent was a live oak, a
Christmas present from White House staff members, which he placed at the
side of his house. With a 10-inch diameter, it is more than a sapling.</TE>
<TE>   "Tree plant, very good," he proclaimed.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the cutting.</TE>
<TE>   "We're making great progress in one of our . . . bottom areas that was
heretofore relatively inaccessible," he said. "It's a beautiful place.
It's a bodark grove. Bodark tree is a native tree, real hardwood that
grows these giant green, kind of apple-looking things," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So he plants and cuts, plants and cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike another ranching president, Ronald Reagan, Bush shows no
particular affinity for horses. He drives himself about the property--the
only place he gets behind the wheel--in a white extended-cab pickup. On
Friday, a convoy of Secret Service vehicles trailed behind.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey vultures circled overhead, and the ever-present Spot bounded
out of the truck.</TE>
<TE>   At the Reagan ranch, the wildlife could be troublesome; rattlesnakes
slithered nearby while the president rode the hills northwest of Santa
Barbara. In Crawford, it was Spot who made White House aides visibly
anxious.</TE>
<TE>   He drew up almost directly behind the president, who was speaking on
live television about the war in Afghanistan, and relieved himself. Much
to the relief of the staffers, the television camera was focused on the
president's face.</TE>
<TE>   This much has changed in the pattern here:</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the first year of presidential visits, work is
omnipresent.</TE>
<TE>   There were morning videoconferences with the National Security
Council; a telephone call from the Russian president to exchange holiday
greetings; discussion about the forthcoming State of the Union address;
and consideration of circumventing a balky Senate and appointing several
controversial nominees to government jobs while the Congress is in
recess.</TE>
<TE>   But what about life in Crawford, the crossroads hamlet of 705 the
president now calls home?</TE>
<TE>   The barbershop offering $2 shaves is still open--at odd hours. The
yellow Formica kitchen table with the chrome legs, an artifact of
American design for sale last summer in a secondhand shop, is still for
sale. It is still missing a leaf.</TE>
<TE>   And rundown houses still greet the occasional traffic arriving on Farm
Road 185, offering a hint of the Dust Bowl, circa 1935.</TE>
<TE>   So it was before Sept. 11. So it is today.</TE>

<HD>Rehnquist Urges Action on Judicial Picks</HD>
<DH>Courts: The chief justice said Senate Democrats should schedule
votes soon on nominees for federal vacancies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Four years ago, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist chided the
Senate Republicans for stalling on President Clinton's nominees to the
federal courts.</LD>
<LD>   "The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular
nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry, it should vote him up
or vote him down," the chief justice said then in his year-end report on
the federal judiciary.</LD>
<LD>   Rehnquist repeated the admonition in a report issued today, but this
time it was directed at Senate Democrats.</LD>
<TE>   "When I spoke to this issue [as 1997 ended], there were 82 judicial
vacancies," Rehnquist said. "When the Senate adjourned on [this] Dec. 20,
there were 94 vacancies."</TE>
<TE>   The three-tiered federal court system is supposed to have 862 judges.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush nominated 80 judges during his first year in office,
but only 28 won Senate confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   "The Senate ought to act with reasonable promptness and to vote each
nominee up or down," Rehnquist said.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, then the ranking
Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, applauded Rehnquist's message and
said he hoped it "will help shame" the Republicans into "clearing the
backlog early next year."</TE>
<TE>   Now chairman of the committee, Leahy issued a more equivocal statement
pledging to "seek consensus and to move forward to fill remaining
vacancies."</TE>
<TE>   Like Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), his predecessor as chairman, Leahy
has brought up before the committee only those proposed judges who have
support from key senators from both parties.</TE>
<TE>   Quick action was possible in these cases, Leahy said, "because the
Senate believed these nominees for lifetime appointments would put
justice and the law ahead of rigid ideology."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the Democrats have refused to schedule hearings on several of
Bush's most prominent nominees to the U.S. Court of Appeals. They include
Washington attorney John G. Roberts, a former clerk to Rehnquist, and
attorney Miguel Estrada, who once clerked at the Supreme Court for
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   University of Utah law professor Michael McConnell and Los Angeles
Superior Court Judge Carolyn Kuhl, all of whom were nominated in the
first half of last year, also have no hearing scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Leahy pointed out that his committee had approved more
judges in his six months of Democratic control than were approved during
the first year of the presidencies of Clinton and the senior George Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The chief justice mentioned no names in his report, but urged the
Senate to schedule "up or down votes" on all the nominees within a
reasonable period.</TE>
<TE>   Besides confirming more judges to fill vacancies, Rehnquist also asked
Congress to authorize more judges in California.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. 9th Circuit of Appeals, which reviews federal cases from the
Western states, has seen its cases rise by 95% since the mid-1980s, he
said. The circuit needs five additional judges, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The trial courts in San Diego are swamped by drug and immigration
cases, Rehnquist said.</TE>
<TE>   "The judges there have the highest number of filings per judge of any
federal district court in the nation," he said, and called upon Congress
to authorize eight more judges for California's southernmost district.</TE>

<LD>Queen Elizabeth II offered to give up the royal yacht Britannia 30
years ago to help the British government during economic difficulties,
according to official papers released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Files given to the Public Record Office show the offer was turned down
by Harold Wilson's Labor government in the late 1960s. It was then kept
secret for fear of a public backlash at a time of deeply unpopular public
spending cuts.</LD>
<LD>   "The queen hopes that you and the secretary of state for defense may
feel free to consider the future of the royal yacht in connection with
any discussions which you may be undertaking about the armed services,"
Elizabeth's private secretary, Sir Michael Adeane, wrote in 1968.</LD>

<LD>   Sydney had been ringed by bush fires to its north, south and west for
more than a week, but today's outbreak in Pennant Hills in the city's
bushy northern area was the first to penetrate the suburbs.</LD>
<LD>   A fire service spokesman said the blaze was less than 12 miles from
the city center.</LD>

<DH>Latin America: Families line up at morgue as death toll nears 300.</DH>

<DL>LIMA, Peru
</DL>
<LD>Police combed through downtown Lima for fireworks Monday, lugging
away crate after crate of Roman candles, bottle rockets and firecrackers
in hopes of averting a disaster like the inferno that killed nearly 300
people over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The seizures followed what one official said was the deadliest fire in
Peru's history, which occurred Saturday night in an area of historic
downtown Lima filled with holiday shoppers.</LD>
<LD>   Lima Fire Chief Tulio Nicolini said the blaze began after sparks from
a firecracker, lighted apparently as a demonstration, ignited others on
some of the dozens of fireworks stands nearby.</LD>
<TE>   The ensuing blaze devoured four blocks of decrepit apartment buildings
and shopping galleries in a matter of minutes, leaving dozens of people,
including small children, charred beyond recognition.</TE>
<TE>   About 40 tons of fireworks had been stashed in the congested
neighborhood, said Gabriela Adrianzen of the mayor's office.</TE>
<TE>   As rescue workers continued to search for victims, Atty. Gen. Nelly
Calderon said the death toll had reached 290 by Monday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said they will confiscate tons of fireworks nationwide,
possibly a difficult task in a country where firecrackers have been
central to public celebrations for hundreds of years.</TE>
<TE>   Vendors complained that they were being deprived of a major source of
income. Peru imported an estimated 940 tons of fireworks just for this
holiday season, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of teary-eyed relatives and friends gathered outside the Lima
morgue Monday, clutching photographs of people they believed had perished
in the fire. The mourners were waiting to identify relatives, many after
spending the night outside.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials said that some bodies would never be recovered
and that others were so charred that those seeking missing loved ones
were not being allowed to view them.</TE>

vote.</LD>
<LD>   The seven opposition parties accuse the governing Movement for

manipulating the vote count. Voting was Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Results from 139 of 150 voting constituencies showed Levy Mwanawasa,
the MMD's presidential candidate, leading his nearest rival, Anderson
Mazoka, by more than 31,000 votes. Final results are expected today.</LD>

<HD>Moose Relocation Debated in Wake of Deadly Crash</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>Dangling a moose from a helicopter might seem a drastic form of
animal control, but Utah wildlife officials say it's the fastest and
easiest way to evict the potentially dangerous animals from populated
areas.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike deer and other large animals that also walk along busy roads
and into neighborhoods during snowy winters, moose can be picked up and
moved because they are hardy and handle the relocation well.</LD>
<LD>   Last week one of the airlifts turned deadly. Three men were killed
after their helicopter clipped a power line and crashed into a frozen
reservoir. The state Division of Wildlife Resources is debating whether
to continue to use helicopters to move moose.</LD>
<TE>   Division spokesman Mark Hadley said the relocation effort became a
priority after seven moose were hit and killed by drivers on Interstate
80 in Parleys Canyon during the last month.</TE>
<TE>   "Heavy snowfall has been driving moose down close to I-80. It's always
a danger to hit any big game animal, but especially moose because of
their size," Hadley said.</TE>
<TE>   During the Winter Olympics in February, electronic signs along the
highway will alert drivers if animals are seen near the road. State
officials also are considering putting up more warning signs and giving
written warnings to Olympic visitors as they pick up rental cars.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike deer and elk, moose appear not to suffer any damage from
tranquilizers or being hoisted by helicopter. During an airlift the moose
are netted, then blindfolded, tied up and lifted by helicopter to
corrals. From there they are trucked to other areas.</TE>

<LD>Jesse Jackson said he will meet with Harvard University's president
to discuss the school's diversity policy after reports that high-profile
black professors may leave over a dispute with the administration.</LD>
<LD>   The Boston Globe reported Dec. 22 that the rift began when Harvard
President Lawrence Summers would not make a strong statement in support
of affirmative action at a meeting with members of the Afro-American
studies department.</LD>
<LD>   Summers said he supports diversity and meant no offense. "It's a very
unfortunate misunderstanding if my views have been perceived in other
ways," he said.</LD>

<LD>A new security fence, video cameras and motion detectors are taking
the place of federal police guarding the headgates of the Klamath
Reclamation Project irrigation system in Klamath Falls.</LD>
<LD>   The $90,000 security system was completed around the U.S. Bureau of
Reclamation structure that became the center of protests last summer over
restricting irrigation water to farms to conserve water for threatened
and endangered fish, spokesman Dave Jones said.</LD>
<LD>   The security system went up after protesters met with authorities the
day after the Sept. 11 attacks and said they would pull out to allow the
federal government to concentrate on fighting terrorism.</LD>

<HD>Jamaica's Murder Toll Rises 27%</HD>
<DH>Violence: Three deaths over the weekend bring total for the year to
1,131 on the island of 2.6 million people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>KINGSTON, Jamaica
</DL>
<LD>Weekend killings in Jamaica brought the Caribbean island's murder
toll to 1,131 for the year, an increase of more than 27% over last year,
according to a newspaper report Monday.</LD>
<LD>   During the weekend, a soldier was shot dead by gunmen, a woman was
fatally stabbed and her husband charged with her murder, and a laborer
was stabbed to death during an argument at a wedding reception, the
Jamaica Gleaner reported.</LD>
<LD>   Police could not be reached for comment Monday, when many offices
closed early for New Year's Eve.</LD>
<TE>   The newspaper said the latest killings brought Jamaica's murder total
to 1,131 during 2001, up from 887 last year. The dead included 15 members
of the Jamaica Constabulary Force and two soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   The island has one of the worst per capita murder rates in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the violence, especially in the impoverished urban areas of
the capital, has been blamed on armed gangs loyal to Jamaica's two major
political parties, the ruling People's National Party and the opposition
Jamaica Labor Party.</TE>
<TE>   Such violence has been common in the months leading up to national
elections in the past. Jamaica's next elections are due before the end of
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Jamaica's police and army have been on high alert since early July,
when 25 people died in politically charged gun battles between security
forces and residents in West Kingston.</TE>
<TE>   The soldier killed during the weekend, Oneil Henry, 24, was among a
group of people playing cards and dominoes in Kingston when a group of
heavily armed men approached and opened fire. Henry was shot and killed
and a 14-year-old girl was grazed by a bullet in the attack, which police
said may have been linked to a gang feud.</TE>
<TE>   A 25-year-old woman, Estriana Edward-Simmons, was stabbed to death
during a domestic dispute at her home Saturday night, and her husband,
George Simmons, was arrested on a murder charge, the newspaper said.</TE>
<TE>   The other weekend murder victim, Derrick Bailey, was stabbed to death
during a knife fight with another guest at a wedding reception early
Sunday, the newspaper said.</TE>

<HD>First Sale: A Kilo of Litchi Nuts</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. DENIS, Reunion
</DL>
<LD>The euro became legal tender with the arrival of midnight Monday on
the French island Reunion in the Indian Ocean. The mayor made the first
purchase, buying some litchi nuts.</LD>
<LD>   Reunion, an overseas department of France, welcomed the new year--and
thus the euro--three hours before the French mainland and two hours
before Greece and Finland led the 12 euro-zone countries into monetary
union.</LD>
<LD>   Euros were transported to the island, to the east of Madagascar and
5,800 miles from Paris, by boat and plane, to be ready for circulation
today.</LD>
<TE>   The moment was celebrated by the mayor of Reunion's main town, St.
Denis, on the island's northern coast.</TE>
<TE>   "I hereby give you my first coin," Rene-Paul Victoria said as he made
his first purchase with the new currency, buying a kilo, or 2.2 pounds,
of litchis for 76 euro cents at a fruit stand.</TE>
<TE>   French Finance Minister Laurent Fabius, speaking to residents of
Reunion in a television broadcast, forecast a smooth transition.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe everything has been very well prepared," Fabius said, "and
the changeover is being carried out in good humor."</TE>
<TE>   In the town of St. Gilles-les-Bains, a restaurant owner was still
waiting for his first customer to produce a crisp new euro bill.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, it's only been credit cards," said Jean-Pierre Plantey, owner
of the Saint-Gilles restaurant. "The second I get my first payment in
euros--no matter what the amount--I'm hanging up the bill on my bar."</TE>

<HD>Defense Lawyers Say Sept. 11 Exploited in Terror Trial</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>AMMAN, Jordan
</DL>
<LD>Jordanian lawyers defending a California-born man charged with
plotting attacks on U.S. targets on orders of Osama bin Laden accused
prosecutors Monday of exploiting the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Raed Hijazi was charged last year along with 27 other suspected
followers of Bin Laden of planning to attack Western and Israeli tourists
in Jordan during millennium celebrations.</LD>
<LD>   He was convicted in absentia and given the death sentence, which was
commuted to life imprisonment.</LD>
<TE>   Jordanian law requires that suspects convicted in absentia be retried
if caught. Syria extradited Hijazi to Jordan and his retrial began in
May. He denies the charges.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Hani Abdul Qader said prosecutors had harnessed the
publicity surrounding Bin Laden's Al Qaeda network to help secure a
conviction.</TE>
<TE>   He said the prosecution had charged Hijazi with membership in the
outlawed group even though that charge had been dropped in his previous
conviction.</TE>

<HD>Gulf Arabs Urge Iraq to Allow U.N. Review</HD>
<DH>Middle East: Weapon inspections would aid in easing tensions in the
region and could help end economic sanctions, state leaders say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MUSCAT, Oman
</DL>
<LD>Gulf Arab states urged neighboring Iraq on Monday to allow U.N.
weapon inspectors back into the country or risk more tension in the
Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   The leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council also called on Iraq to
show goodwill toward its neighbors and respect the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Kuwait, which Baghdad invaded in 1990 before
being driven out seven months later by a U.S.-led multinational force.</LD>
<LD>   The GCC alliance groups oil-rich Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab
Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.</LD>
<TE>   "The council calls on both Iraq and the secretary-general of the
United Nations to resume negotiations to renew cooperation based on
foundations whereby the Security Council can lift economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq and end the suffering of the brotherly Iraqi people,"
said a communique at the end of a GCC summit in Oman.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations says sanctions, imposed on Iraq for its invasion of
Kuwait, cannot be lifted unless Baghdad allows international weapon
inspectors back into the country to check for weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope Iraq's obstinacy toward some Security Council resolutions
will not lead to more tension in the region," GCC Secretary-General Jamil
Hejailan said at the summit.</TE>
<TE>   He also criticized Baghdad for continuing antagonism toward its
pro-Western neighbors Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   The leaders called on Iraq to cooperate over the issue of Kuwaitis and
other nationals missing since the 1990-91 Gulf War and to return Kuwait
state property.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has warned Iraqi President Saddam Hussein he will "find
out" the consequences if he does not readmit the arms inspectors,
triggering speculation that Iraq might be the next target of the U.S.-led
anti-terrorism war.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq, which is on a U.S. list of states sponsoring terrorism, has
denied any link to Saudi-born militant Osama bin Laden, whom Washington
accuses of planning the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Hejailan said Saturday that the GCC would oppose any attack against
any Arab country.</TE>

<HD>Palestinian State a Must, Arafat Says</HD>
<DH>Mideast: International and regional security rest on independence,
the leader says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>GAZA CITY
</DL>
<LD>Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat said on Monday, 37
years after his Fatah movement launched a war on Israel, that a state for
his people is fundamental to regional and international stability.</LD>
<LD>   Arafat's speech came against the backdrop of a 15-month-old uprising
against Israeli occupation that has cost more than 1,000 lives, most of
them Palestinian.</LD>
<LD>   "The Palestinian state, with holy Jerusalem as its capital, is not
only a condition for peace but a fundamental basis for international and
regional security and stability," Arafat said in the speech, which was
broadcast on Palestinian media.</LD>
<TE>   He said that a Palestinian state should be established on land
captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War and that Palestinians are
more determined than ever to achieve it.</TE>
<TE>   "Some in Israel still do not want to see this fact, and they see in
the tank, the chopper and the bulldozer the only ways to deal with the
Palestinian people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's killing of six Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on Sunday drew
threats of revenge from militants who have defied Arafat's Dec. 16 call
to halt attacks on Israelis, but the Palestinian leader said peace is the
best choice.</TE>
<TE>   "The Palestinian people who chose peace as a strategic choice stand
today on solid ground; they will not be weakened and will not be
humiliated, and their rights will not be wasted as long as we have blood
pulsing through our veins," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's Fatah movement launched its first armed attack against an
Israeli target on Jan. 1, 1965.</TE>
<TE>   In the name of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Arafat signed a
peace treaty with Israel in 1993. But the treaty has so far given
Palestinians control only of parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and
not a full state.</TE>
<TE>   "We will pursue the firm hope in our hearts of raising a Palestinian
flag over the walls, the churches and mosques of Jerusalem, capital of
our independent Palestine," Arafat said.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of people demonstrated to support Arafat in Gaza and in the
West Bank city of Ramallah, where he has his headquarters and where has
been blocked in by Israel, which says he must hand over militants who
killed an Israeli Cabinet minister.</TE>

<DL>KIGALI, Rwanda
</DL>
<LD>Hoping symbols can help heal, Rwanda unveiled a new flag, national
anthem and coat of arms Monday at a gathering of national reconciliation
7 1/2 years after more than 800,000 people died in ethnic massacres.</LD>
<LD>   A trumpet played as two army captains lowered the old red, green and
yellow flag for the last time at a ceremony at Kigali's Amahoro Stadium,
where thousands of minority Tutsis sought refuge in 1994 from Hutu
attackers.</LD>
<LD>   The new flag has a gold sun with 24 rays on a field of green, yellow
and blue. President Paul Kagame said the colors stand for prosperity,
wealth, peace and happiness.</LD>
<TE>   The new anthem, chosen in an international competition, praises the
natural beauty of Rwanda, a country of rolling green hills and dormant
and semi-dormant volcanoes. It refers to the country's 8.3 million people
simply as Rwandans. It was composed by a group of jailed Hutus awaiting
trial on charges of genocide. The warden said he submitted the song to
encourage reconciliation.</TE>

<HD>Ebola Death Toll Hits 22 as 2 More Die of Virus</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LIBREVILLE, Gabon
</DL>
<LD>Two more people have died from Ebola in Africa, bringing to 22 the
death toll from an outbreak of the virus in Gabon and the neighboring
Republic of Congo, the World Health Organization said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "Thirty confirmed cases . . . including 22 deaths have been reported.
An additional five cases are under investigation in Gabon," the WHO said
in a statement.</LD>
<LD>   The organization said last week that 20 people had died from the
disease, which is spread by contact with bodily fluids. There is no
vaccine and no known cure.</LD>
<TE>   The outbreak was first reported in early December in northern Gabon.
The WHO said 18 of the confirmed cases were in Gabon and 12 were in the
Republic of Congo. A total of 182 other people thought to have had direct
contact with the blood or other bodily fluids of those infected were also
being followed up, the agency said.</TE>
<TE>   Early diagnosis of Ebola is difficult because victims suffer symptoms
similar to those of the flu. The virus becomes apparent only in the last
stages, when it eats through the victim's veins and arteries, causing
massive internal bleeding.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Russian software programmer, freed in November after escaping
prosecution under controversial U.S. copyright laws, returned home
and praised those who campaigned for his release.</LD>
<LD>   Dmitry Sklyarov, 27, told NTV television at a Moscow airport that
his release had defied the odds of trying to defeat the U.S.
authorities in legal proceedings.</LD>
<LD>   Sklyarov, the first person to be charged with violating the 1998
Digital Millennium Copyright Act, was accused of selling and
conspiring to sell technology designed to circumvent copyright
protections in a computer program. His arrest followed a presentation
in Las Vegas in July about software he had developed to allow
computer users to copy digital books.</LD>
<TE>   Sklyarov was freed as part of a "diversion agreement" under which
he admitted facts but no illegal activity. His company, ElcomSoft of
Moscow, still faces charges and a potential fine of $2.25 million.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine states seeking stricter antitrust penalties against Microsoft
Corp. asked a federal judge to reject the software maker's proposal
to delay hearings in the case until July or August.</LD>
<LD>   The states' attorneys general said in court papers that a new
remedies phase of the 3those-year-old case should be held in March as
U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly has ordered.</LD>
<LD>   "That Microsoft stands to benefit from delay is obvious," the
attorneys general said.</LD>
<TE>   The states are seeking restrictions on Microsoft's business
practices that go beyond a proposed settlement signed by the Bush
administration and nine other states.</TE>
<TE>   "Microsoft can hardly be accused of delay," said company spokesman
Jim Desler. "Any delay is really the fault of these non-settling
states" that have "launched an entirely new case."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft shares fell $1.62 to close at $66.25 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>PeopleSoft Inc. may reacquire Momentum Business Applications Inc. to
avoid paying software royalties and ease investor concerns that the
companies' relationship obscures PeopleSoft's expenses.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Financial Officer Kevin Parker said PeopleSoft, of
Pleasanton, Calif., will decide soon whether to exercise an option to
buy Momentum. PeopleSoft spun off Momentum, also of Pleasanton, in
1999 to boost profit by shifting some software development costs, an
accounting arrangement that rule makers have since banned.</LD>
<LD>   PeopleSoft shares lost $2 to close at $40.20, and Momentum fell 10
cents to $19.90, both on Nasdaq.</LD>

months, from November of last year through July 2001," said John
Challenger, chief executive of the Chicago-based firm.</LD>
<TE>   Still, Internet job cuts for all of 2001 were 100,925, more than

charge added to monthly bills of its customers, up from 9.9%, to fund
the $5.5-billion account that ensures that low-income and rural
consumers get phone service, said spokeswoman Claudia Jones.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Communications Commission says carriers such as AT&amp;T,
WorldCom Inc. and Sprint Corp. should deposit 6.81% of third-quarter
revenue into the subsidy system. AT&amp;T said that beginning today, it
must assess a higher fee on its customers to compensate for a decline
in sales.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of AT&amp;T fell 4 cents to close at $18.14 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Revelry With Dose of Security</HD>
<DH>Celebration: Extra measures are taken in stride at Disney theme
parks, and Fullerton has its annual First Night party.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tens of thousands of New Year's Eve celebrants packed Disneyland on
Monday night, unfazed by heightened security that included front-gate
purse searchers and uniformed police officers scattered throughout the
Anaheim resort area.</LD>
<LD>   A few miles away, many more welcomed 2002 at First Night Fullerton, a
family-oriented street fair.</LD>
<LD>   At the inaugural New Year's Eve festivities for Disney's California
Adventure, some guests partook of beer or a bit of bubbly.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't want to see any stumbling drunks running around Disneyland,
but as long as people keep their cool, it's fine," said Nick Fernando,
21, of Torrance, as he sipped an $8 glass of champagne at the Golden Vine
Winery in California Adventure.</TE>
<TE>   Deron McCoy, 29, of Hermosa Beach said he and his friends had visited
the theme park so they could have a couple of beers with dinner. "We got
some tickets at the 11th hour," he said. "We decided to come to
Disneyland because everything in the L.A. area was pretty calm. We
thought this would be something different."</TE>
<TE>   It did seem festive as park officials handed out party hats and
noisemakers that sounded like quacking ducks. Countdowns to midnight were
planned at several locations in both Disney parks.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Nachum, spokeswoman for Disneyland Resort, said New Year's
Eve "is the busiest time of year for us. It's a well-known fact."</TE>
<TE>   Though Disney does not release attendance figures, one supervisor said
projections were the same as for 2000: about 65,000 at the Magic Kingdom,
with 15,000 more arriving after midnight from Disney's California
Adventure. The holiday is Disneyland's latest night of the year. It
closes at 3 a.m., and California Adventure closes at 1 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody was turned away from either park this year, officials said.
Ticket sales were halted three times between Christmas and New Year's in
2000, because of heavy crowds, but that did not happen in 2001, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   All three of the resort's hotels were sold out for the night, however,
and other large hotels in Anaheim reported the same situation, including
the 1,572-room Anaheim Hilton and Towers and the 489-room Sheraton
Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it would be quieter, to tell you the truth," said Al Lutz,
editor of the MousePlanet.com Web site, which is devoted to unofficial
Disney news and advice. Disney parks in Florida seem to have been hurt
more by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "For some reason, we've been really unaffected out here. I think
they've been doing great. Disneyland, in particular, has been well
exceeding its numbers," Lutz said.</TE>
<TE>   Disney officials said security has been heightened since the terrorist
attacks and guests are being asked to open their purses and backpacks for
searches. "It doesn't bother me," Erica Sotelo, 20, of Los Angeles. "It's
for safety. It takes up a little time, makes the lines longer, but that's
it. I love Disneyland."</TE>
<TE>   The only other reminders of the tragedy were U.S. flag decorations and
the red, white and blue merchandise that has popped up at stores
throughout the resort area.</TE>
<TE>   Crowds were heavy Monday, with 90-minute waits for popular Disneyland
attractions such as the Indiana Jones Adventure and Space Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   Both Disney parks had plenty of holiday trimmings: Christmas lights
and decorations, the fireworks and snow show, special entertainment at
California Adventure, and rides such as the Haunted Mansion and It's a
Small World made over for the season.</TE>
<TE>   Even Disneyland's trademark "Happiest Place on Earth" motto was
altered ever so slightly on concession area napkins and cups to read "The
Merriest Place on Earth."</TE>
<TE>   That was fine with John Talwar, 17, of Sierra Madre, who said he had
not come looking for Mickey Mouse anyway. "I'm just checking out the
ladies," said Talwar, adding that he and his friends were supposed to
meet some girls at Legoland in north San Diego County. "I'm pretty sure
they're going to be there," he said. "I hope. Knock on wood."</TE>
<TE>   In Fullerton, meanwhile, families gathered for the 11th year to
celebrate New Year's Eve. Most of the entertainment at the late-night,
non-alcoholic event was aimed at the young and featured acrobats, stilt
walkers, magicians, a sorcerer, pony rides and plenty of equipment for
climbing and bouncing. And nobody passed judgment on the quality of the
karaoke singing.</TE>
<TE>   Curt and Nancy Regitz of Fullerton said they have always partied with
adults on New Year's Eves past. This year, however, they wanted to be
with their 4-year-old twins, Jack and Bailey. "This is our first time at
First Night Fullerton, but it's been great," Nancy Regitz said.</TE>
<TE>   The couple had talked friends Steve and Joy Wright into bringing their
three children as well. "This is really what Fullerton is all about:
family," Steve Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   Would the whole group make it until midnight? "We hope not," Nancy
Regitz said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the Sunny Hills High School girls water polo team
would not even think of shutting down before welcoming the new year. They
flitted through the crowd selling light-up rings ($3 each) to raise money
for team events. "We always make a lot of money," said Eleanor Deleon,
16.</TE>
<TE>   Others also were out working for a cause. Fullerton First Christian
Church sold chili and hot dogs to raise money for its weekly Wednesday
dinner for about 100 homeless people. "The crowd isn't quite as great as
last year, when we sold out," said Leslie Beck, one of the church
workers. "But it's colder this year, and it's still early."</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton Mayor Don Bankhead said the annual event should have special
meaning this year because of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "First Night embodies the energy and positive spirit that make
Fullerton strong," he said. "It demonstrates the resilience, unity and
creativity of Americans."</TE>

<HD>Violence on Rise at Central O.C. Cyber Cafes</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police say weekend slaying at PC Cafe in Garden Grove is the
latest in a string of assaults at teen hangouts.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police are stepping up patrols and seeking new laws aimed at
halting a string of violent incidents at late-night cyber cafes in
central Orange County, including the death early Monday of 20-year-old
man attacked while waiting to play a video game.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of cyber cafes have sprung up in Garden Grove and surrounding
cities, bustling through the night with teens who come to access the
Internet and play the latest video games. But the late-night venues have
increasingly drawn gang members and others looking for trouble,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Garden Grove and Santa Ana have been the hardest hit, reporting more
than a dozen assaults, stabbings and robberies in recent months at the
cafes. This weekend's attack marked the first slaying, and Garden Grove
authorities said they will ask the City Council to pass ordinances more
strictly regulating the cafes and limiting the hours teens can patronize
them.</LD>
<TE>   "It's always alarming when you have this type of increase in
violence," Garden Grove Police Sgt. Mike Handfield said. "We've tried to
be active but there's only so much you can do."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's attack, police said, occurred shortly after Phuong Huu Ly and
a friend arrived at PC Cafe about 8:35 p.m., intending to spend the
evening playing video games for $2 an hour. As they entered, the pair
spotted two boys about 16 years old watching them from inside, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   The cafe, which stays open until 4 a.m., was full, so Ly and his
friend smoked a cigarette outside as they waited for a computer to become
available. A few minutes later, the two teenage boys from inside
confronted them, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the boys pulled a large screwdriver he had tucked into his
waistband and stabbed Ly in the head, police said. The assailants ran,
yelling gang monikers as they jumped into a light green Honda Accord and
sped east on Garden Grove Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Ly, of Santa Ana, was pronounced dead 7 1/2 hours later at UC Irvine
Medical Center in Orange. Police identified him as a "gang associate,"
and said they suspect the slaying was motivated by a gang rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   Though Garden Grove police have not kept statistics on the trend,
officials said they have noticed a steady rise in violence at the city's
19 cyber cafes. Gang detectives, in particular, have spent extra time
scouting out the venues in search of troublemakers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to get up to speed," Handfield said. "We didn't
anticipate this many problems."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's killing follows recent violent episodes at the same cafe,
which has seen more problems than most, Handfield said. In November, a
dispute between two game players quickly turned into a melee, as four
teenagers wielded baseball bats in the middle of the cafe. Two people
were seriously injured.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks earlier, another gang-related brawl at the cafe ended in a
stabbing that police are treating as attempted murder.</TE>
<TE>   Monday afternoon, the only violence at PC Cafe was on computer screens
as dozens of teenage boys fought each other in a popular computer game
that pits heavily armed terrorists against even more heavily armed
police.</TE>
<TE>   As the sound of shots and explosions rang out around him, Fernando
Padilla Jr., 18, took a short break from his game to say the cafe has
been unfairly maligned by police.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a gang hangout," said Padilla, who plays for three hours
daily. "There are 5-year-old kids who come in and they've got skill."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Woo, co-owner of PC Cafe, also defended the operation. He
pointed to a list of rules he said are strictly enforced. Computer users
are forbidden from cursing, yelling and running.</TE>
<TE>   Mounted surveillance cameras watch inside and behind the cafe, and Woo
said he plans to add another camera this week in front of the store,
where Ly was killed.</TE>
<TE>   But Woo acknowledged that fights do occasionally break out. Some game
players, he said, became carried away with their contests and resort to
real violence. And he expressed frustration at his unsuccessful efforts
to exclude gang members.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing we can do to tell they're gang members," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The burgeoning popularity of cyber cafes like Woo's has fueled a rapid
expansion across the region. But in Garden Grove, at least, city
officials will probably make it harder to operate them, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Plans are underway to require owners to apply for a city permit that
would restrict how late the cafes can stay open, Handfield said. Other
rules, he said, will probably forbid youngsters from frequenting the
venues late at night.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the kids to be able to go in and play the games they want
to," Handfield said. "But when it comes to people being assaulted, we
have to draw the line."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana officials said they are giving more scrutiny to several
cyber cafes on the city's west side, which they believe are becoming
favorite locations for Asian gangs.</TE>
<TE>   "They are hangouts . . . and that's when the problems start," Officer
Mario Corona said.</TE>

<HD>Californians Wake Up to Hundreds of New Laws for 2002</HD>
<DH>Legislation: From sales tax to junk food on campus, most start
today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>The energy crisis caused chaos in the state Capitol last year, and
legislators labored so long to make sure the lights stayed on in
California that there was little time for much else in the way of
lawmaking.</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, Democrats and Republicans in the Assembly and Senate
still managed to send more than 1,100 bills to Gov. Gray Davis during the
year, and 948 were signed into law, only slightly fewer than the year
before. Most of those new laws take effect today.</LD>
<LD>   Some, such as bans on junk-food sales at elementary and middle
schools, increased unemployment benefits, and expanded rights for gay and
lesbian couples who register as domestic partners, will affect hundreds
of thousands of Californians.</LD>
<TE>   Others, such as permission to register Harley-Davidson motorcycles
with replacement engine cases, are somewhat more esoteric, but no less
meaningful to those they will affect.</TE>
<TE>   One change many Californians will quickly notice in the new year--a
quarter-cent increase in sales taxes--was not the result of a new law at
all, but an old law coming home to roost.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to a formula fashioned in 1991 under former Gov. Pete Wilson,
the tax was supposed to go down if the state amassed a certain level of
surplus revenue. That happened a few years ago, and the tax was
automatically lowered. But the formula also called for the tax to go back
up when the surplus levels no longer existed. That happened last year,
when the state economy started to soften, thus triggering the tax hike.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, now a political minority in Sacramento, made great noise
about the silent tax increase, accusing Davis of spending too much. But
the majority Democrats approved a state budget that took the additional
tax money--estimated at more than $1 billion a year--into account.</TE>
<TE>   Another change that will be immediately apparent is an increase in the
state's minimum wage, which goes up 50 cents today to $6.75 an hour. The
state's Industrial Welfare Commission, which sets the wage, agreed in
2000 to raise it $1, spreading the boost over two years.</TE>
<TE>   Education is always a hot issue in Sacramento, and 2001 was no
exception. Among the numerous bills on school testing and finance,
however, it was the junk-food bill by state Sen. Martha Escutia
(D-Whittier) that generated some of the most spirited debate. The
measure, SB 19, mandates that foods sold at elementary and middle schools
must meet certain nutritional requirements. It also boosts the state
reimbursement for school lunch programs.</TE>
<TE>   Escutia met with strong opposition from soft-drink companies and other
junk-food makers when she argued that California schoolchildren were
bombarded with unhealthful food, and some Republicans openly called the
legislation hypocritical, noting that lawmakers commonly eat junk food on
the floor of the Legislature. But the measure passed in a compromise vote
after Escutia watered down its scope to exclude the ultimate junk-food
consumers, high schoolers.</TE>
<TE>   The domestic partner law, by Assemblywoman Carole Migden,
significantly expands a landmark law the San Francisco Democrat sponsored
in 1999 that allows gays and lesbians to register as partners with the
state.</TE>
<TE>   The new law, AB 25, gives gays and lesbians who register as partners
expanded rights, including being able to adopt a partner's child,
receiving the same status as a spouse in a statutory will, and using
employee sick leave to take care of a partner or partner's child. The
rights will benefit not only gays and lesbians, but also unmarried
seniors, many of whom have registered as partners.</TE>
<TE>   Many Republicans vehemently opposed expanding domestic partner rights,
arguing that it ran counter to the successful 2000 ballot measure
establishing that marriage in California is between a man and a woman.
But Democrats called that argument misleading, noting that domestic
partnerships are not marriage unions, and approved the measure on a
party-line vote.</TE>
<TE>   The unemployment benefits bill takes effect at a time when a greater
number of Californians are without jobs because of the weakened economy
and the fallout from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. It increases weekly
unemployment payments from $230 to $450 over the next four years. The
measure, SB 40 by Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar), provides the first
increase in unemployment benefits in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   There are other important laws that take effect today. And, as always,
there are some quirky changes to the statutes that initially may leave
many scratching their heads.</TE>
<TE>   The Harley-Davidson bill, for example--SB 1173, by state Sen. Maurice
Johannessen (R-Redding)--was sponsored by the California Motorcycle
Dealers Assn. It requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to register
Harleys with replacement engine cases. An old law barred the DMV from
doing so because Harley-Davidsons formerly had their identification
numbers on the engine cases instead of the frames, and registering bikes
with replacement engines made it hard for authorities to track ones that
were stolen. Harley-Davidson has fixed the problem.</TE>

<HD>Facing a Year of Choices in State Politics</HD>
<DH>Elections: Voters' anxieties over war and recession could affect
the outcome of dozens of races, led by the contest for governor.</DH>

<BD>TIMES POLITICAL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Facing war and recession, California enters this election year a
bundle of contradictions: anxious yet optimistic, eager for stability and
yet open to change.</LD>
<LD>   Voters will make dozens of choices, for governor, the Legislature,
Congress and seven statewide offices. Yet many of the races will be
devoid of true competition, thanks to the political line-drawing of
incumbent lawmakers.</LD>
<LD>   Candidates and issue advocates will spend tens of millions of dollars
on radio and TV advertising. And yet if recent patterns hold, roughly
half of the state's registered voters will sit the election out.</LD>
<TE>   But if there is one thing that can be said with near certainty, it is
that something will happen in 2002 to alter today's political
expectations--and probably something else will happen to scramble them
again.</TE>
<TE>   "We've already had one unprecedented development in the energy
crisis," said Gale Kaufman, a Democratic strategist in Sacramento. "Then
we had Sept. 11, with absolutely no precedent for that. So we're really
heading into territory no one's ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   At the top of the ticket, Democratic Gov. Gray Davis is seeking a
second four-year term with a rich endowment but considerable doubts about
his leadership skills. He may find solace in the facts that no California
governor has been denied a second term in 60 years and no incumbent has
lost since 1966.</TE>
<TE>   Three Republicans, buoyed by Davis' sagging poll numbers, are vying in
the March 5 primary for the right to face the incumbent in November.</TE>
<TE>   Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan is the front-runner against
businessman Bill Simon Jr. and Secretary of State Bill Jones. But few are
ready to declare the Republican race over, given Riordan's penchant for
gaffes and his refusal to cater to the party's conservative wing.</TE>
<TE>   "The race is Riordan's to lose," said Ken Khachigian, a veteran GOP
strategist who is sitting out the party fight. "And he could lose it."</TE>
<TE>   The March primary will also bring yet another change in the way
Californians cast their ballots.</TE>
<TE>   Gone is the "blanket primary" of 2000, in which any registered voter
could cast a ballot for any party, regardless of affiliation. Instead,
the state will conduct its first-ever "semi-open" primary, allowing
roughly 2.2 million decline-to-state voters to participate by requesting
a partisan ballot.</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats, Republicans and others registered with a political
party will not be allowed to vote in any other party's primary.</TE>
<TE>   As far as the initiative process, the March ballot will be fairly tame
by recent California standards. The six measures to be decided involve
issues such as legislative term limits, the state gas tax and
environmental protection--serious matters, but hardly as polarizing as
initiatives during the 1990s that touched on issues such as race and
immigration.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got some pretty tough public policy questions," Democratic
strategist Bill Carrick said. "But nothing that's going to alter the
overall voter turnout in some disproportionate way."</TE>
<TE>Mood Is Different From 4 Years Ago</TE>
<TE>   The mood in California is far different from four years ago, when
times were prosperous and Davis won a landslide victory by promising to
improve the state's schools and otherwise keep things on an even keel.</TE>
<TE>   The state survived last year's electricity crisis without the
apocalypse many forecast--but not before it battered Davis' reputation
and tore a multibillion-dollar hole in the state budget, forcing painful
choices on the governor. "Tough decisions will have to be made," said
Paul Maslin, Davis' pollster, alluding to inevitable budget cutbacks in
this election year.</TE>
<TE>   The state's budget shortfall has been compounded by the recession, the
first in a decade, which has hit Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay
Area particularly hard. At the same time, the travel tremors afflicting
many after Sept. 11 have battered the state's vital tourism industry,
compounding the economic woes.</TE>
<TE>   Strangely enough, however, polls suggest Californians are relatively
upbeat despite their anxieties over the economy and the prospect of
further terrorist attacks. And whatever their concerns, most aren't
taking it out on their elected leaders, the way they have previously in
unsettled times.</TE>
<TE>   Some voter sentiments seem flatly contradictory. More than
half--56%--of those surveyed last month by the Public Policy Institute of
California said they expected the state to face bad times financially in
the next year. And yet 58% said they believed the state was heading in
the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Cain, director of Berkeley's Institute of Governmental Studies,
sees two competing forces at work.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got the war on terrorism plus the suspension of normal
politics, which pushes up people's estimation of institutions and
incumbents," Cain said. "At the same time, you've got economic conditions
which generally lead to public dissatisfaction and a desire for change.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is, how rapidly does our concern about terror
deteriorate and how much longer does our concern about the economy
persist?"</TE>
<TE>   Already there are signs that terrorism is receding as an issue; in the
Public Policy Institute's survey, Californians ranked the economy,
electricity and education as their foremost concerns, with security and
related issues in fourth place.</TE>
<TE>   And there are indications that the worst of the recession may have
passed, although perception tends to lag behind reality, often to the
detriment of incumbents. The economy was well into recovery, for
instance, in 1992 when President George Bush fell victim to the last
downturn and was defeated by Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, partisans on both sides predict a hard-fought and
nasty gubernatorial contest, reflecting how little things have changed
politically since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "If you thought you couldn't attack, if you thought you can't be
negative, every election since Sept. 11 has shown you can," said
Democratic strategist Kaufman, alluding to bitter fall contests in
Virginia, New Jersey and New York City.</TE>
<TE>   But the governor's race may prove an exception in a campaign year that
offers plenty of contests but little true competition.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans had to scramble to put up candidates for the seven
statewide offices on the ballot this year, four of them open seats:
controller, secretary of state, insurance commissioner and superintendent
of public instruction. The three Democratic incumbents, Lt. Gov. Cruz
Bustamante, Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer and Treasurer Phil Angelides, are all
strong favorites for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Voters will also fill four places on the State Board of Equalization,
the tax oversight agency, including vacancies in Northern and Central
California.</TE>
<TE>   The state's 52 House members are up for reelection, although few face
serious competition thanks to the incumbent-protection plan that passed
the Legislature as part of the once-a-decade reapportionment process.</TE>
<TE>   The most vulnerable incumbent is the scandal-scarred Gary Condit, who
faces a stiff primary challenge in the Central Valley from Assemblyman
Dennis Cardoza of Merced, a fellow Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   Two incumbents have drawn potentially serious challenges: Republican
Rep. John Doolittle of Roseville is facing Auburn physician Bill Kirby,
who contends Doolittle is too conservative for the heavily rural
district. In the wine country, Santa Rosa Mayor Mike Martini is
challenging Democratic Rep. Lynn Woolsey, claiming she is too liberal.</TE>
<TE>   Two new House seats have been carved out as a result of population
shifts: one in the Central Valley and the other in southeast Los Angeles
County. A Republican is expected to pick up the Central Valley seat and a
Democrat the one in Southern California, the latter created in part by
carving up the district of retiring Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach). That
would mean a net Democratic gain of one seat, giving them 33 House seats
from California to the Republicans' 20.</TE>
<TE>A Dearth of Competition</TE>
<TE>   There is a similar dearth of competition in most legislative contests,
with just a handful of serious contests around the state among the 80
Assembly and 20 state Senate seats on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "The politicians have basically figured out a way to abolish
elections," said Allan Hoffenblum, publisher of the Target Book, a
handicappers guide to state elections. "Through the adroit use of the
gerrymander, we have politicians picking the people [they choose to
represent] rather than the people picking the politicians."</TE>

<HD>Kwanzaa Fast Focuses on Food Bank</HD>
<DH>Religion: Minister faces criticism for his effort to draw attention
to pantry for people with HIV and AIDS.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA RICHARDSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On his sixth day without food, the Rev. M. Andrew Robinson-Gaither,
already a slim man, is noticeably leaner. Leaner, but not at all hungry,
he said. Since Kwanzaa began the day after Christmas, he had led his
South-Central Los Angeles church on a seven-day fast to focus attention
on the dwindling resources of the church's food pantry for people with
HIV and AIDS.</LD>
<LD>   In black church circles it is a touchy project, this linking of
Christianity with Kwanzaa and Kwanzaa with AIDS. Not only is
Robinson-Gaither mixing the religious with the cultural, but he persists
in talking about HIV and AIDS and encouraging the church community to
embrace homosexual and bisexual people. This is a taboo in many black
churches, which are more likely to urge people to change their sexuality.</LD>
<LD>   "For a black minister in a mainstream denomination to do something
like this is extremely meaningful," said Jeffrey King, founder and chief
executive of In the Meantime, a Silver Lake-based support group for black
men of all sexual orientations. "Can the AIDS crisis [among blacks] be
effectively addressed? I think so. Can it be addressed without the help
of the black church? I don't think so."</LD>
<TE>   Many of Faith United Methodist Church's 250 members have fasted for
half days or for one or two days at a time, donating the food they did
not use to the church's pantry. Only Robinson-Gaither has fasted
completely, sipping just water and juice. Small bags of dried and canned
food from his congregation sit on his office floor, symbols of missed
lunches and dinners.</TE>
<TE>   The pantry, run from the church basement, is the only such pantry in
South-Central. The pantry receives no government funding, and although
donations have been dwindling, need has been steadily growing. In the
last 18 months, the pantry's clients have grown from 250 to about 430
families.</TE>
<TE>   Some older members and those on medication said they accompanied their
pastor in prayer, tried to eat less and sent over the food they skipped.
They know that their church, with its bold red ribbon hanging on the
front, is the subject of whispers around town, but they say they do not
care.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had people say to me that our church is supportive of AIDS, that
it is promoting AIDS," said Mollie Bell, a church member and longtime
community activist. "Well we're supportive of giving people knowledge
about AIDS. I'm just now finding out how it's affecting black
heterosexual women, and that's because a lot of our men are going to jail
and they have sex in jail but don't think they're gay. Then they're
coming home to heterosexual women and giving them AIDS."</TE>
<TE>   According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
the rate of infection among African American men who have sex with men is
30%. In Los Angeles, the rate is 25% for that group and 15% for Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, 20% of HIV-positive African American men said
they had had sex with women in the last six months, according to a recent
county study. That is double the proportion of HIV-positive white men who
reported sex with women, and five times the proportion of infected Latino
men.</TE>
<TE>   In the pretty little church on 108th Street off Western Avenue,
members routinely meld politics, protest and Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   Faith United is where the men dubbed "The L.A.-4" met to plan their
legal defense after the 1992 riots. It was a first stop for former Black
Panther Party leader Elmer "Geronimo" Pratt after a court ordered his
release from prison, and where Robinson-Gaither eulogized former Black
Panther Eldridge Cleaver. The church works on behalf of Mumia Abu Jamal,
the death row inmate in Pennsylvania convicted of murdering a police
officer, and it belongs to a national anti-police-brutality coalition.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say that the church has really grown spiritually since pastor
came 15 years ago," said Elizabeth Bazley. "This fast is just another way
that he really practices what he preaches."</TE>
<TE>   His politics, however, are also personal.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a brother struggling with HIV. He's got a wife and three
kids," Robinson-Gaither said. "I have two cousins who moved away from the
family and died alone, rather than say they had AIDS."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson-Gaither is not the only mainstream black minister in Los
Angeles whose church has a strong AIDS ministry. Many area churches
invest substantially in support groups, counseling and health programs.
Robinson-Gaither points to the Rev. Cecil "Chip" Murray at First African
Methodist Episcopal church as a leader in the cause. Murray's church has
a $6 million program to provide 38 housing units for people with AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   To fight AIDS effectively, Robinson-Gaither said, AIDS activists and
the black church must change.</TE>
<TE>   "The activist community--I'm going to get in trouble for this--insists
on giving a message that is too gay," ignoring the many cases of AIDS
spread by bisexuals who don't see themselves as gay. And the church "will
have to stop criticizing and condemning and singling out homosexuality."
The church is less likely to unilaterally condemn "men and women who have
illegitimate babies. . . . Why do we do it to same-gender-loving people?"</TE>
<TE>   Many in the black religious community who dismiss Robinson-Gaither say
they rely on the Bible.</TE>
<TE>   "Jesus did not hand out condoms," says the Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson,
who runs the Los Angeles-based conservative Brotherhood Organization of a
New Destiny. It is not only immoral but pointless for ministers not to
condemn homosexuality, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to overcome sin, not mask an inner death," Peterson said.
"They're dying spiritually, and all you're doing is preserving the
physical just a little longer." It is a stern but sound theology, he
said. It is the life of the soul that matters, not the body. "If it takes
people dying to change their ways, then let them die."</TE>
<TE>   In some quarters, however, Robinson-Gaither has strong support.</TE>
<TE>   Maulana Karenga, the creator of Kwanzaa and professor of black studies
at Cal State Long Beach, said the pastor should be praised.</TE>
<TE>   "What Gaither is doing goes back to the best of ancient African and
modern African tradition," Karenga said. "We teach that the moral quality
of any society or community is measured by how they treat the most
vulnerable among them."</TE>
<TE>   Another kindred spirit is Archbishop George Stallings, who broke with
the Roman Catholic Church in 1989 and founded the African American
Catholic Congregation.</TE>
<TE>   "Pastor Andrew will take on seemingly impossible or unpopular causes
and he's always out front," Stallings said.</TE>
<TE>   Stallings did not cross the clerical line by affirming homosexuality,
but he said neither is it the role of the church to condemn it. "The
church should invite everyone in and then allow God's grace to work its
will."</TE>

<HD>Aid Stations Aim to Help Illegal Crossers Avoid Perishing in Cold</HD>
<DH>Border: Volunteers stash emergency items at mountain sites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN ELLINGWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DESCANSO, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>Deep in a canyon in eastern San Diego County, the banner is an
incongruous blue smudge against a rugged landscape of scrub oak and
car-sized boulders.</LD>
<LD>   The flag marks an emergency cold-weather kit, one of a series of aid
stations that volunteers have begun installing in the mountains to help
illegal border crossers who venture into terrain that can be as deadly as
it is beautiful.</LD>
<LD>   The aid stations consist of plastic storage bins crammed with
blankets, sleeping bags, jackets, sweatshirts, food and bottled water.
Marked by flags and blinking red bicycle lights atop eight-foot poles,
the stations are the latest effort to prevent fatalities among migrants
sneaking through Southern California's back country.</LD>
<TE>   In summer, most deaths occur in the Imperial County desert, but winter
shifts the danger to San Diego's mountain country for illegal immigrants
returning from holiday visits in Mexico. Seventy-two migrants have died
here since 1996, most of them victims of freezing temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   "We know it's not going to solve everything, but if we can save one
life, it's worth it," said Enrique Morones, a former San Diego Padres
executive who is directing the winter effort.</TE>
<TE>   Morones said he got the idea for the cold-weather kits after joining
volunteers in placing water stations along commonly traveled routes in
Imperial County for the last two years. The leader of that effort, John
Hunter, is helping on the cold-weather project.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, Morones and Hunter hiked into Horsethief
Canyon, about 15 miles north of the border in the Cleveland National
Forest, to resupply bins they had set out two weeks earlier. At each,
they added donated blankets, sweatshirts and trail-mix bars, though there
was little sign that the aid bins had yet been used.</TE>
<TE>   Not far away, eight migrants perished and more than 50 others had to
be rescued in 1999 after they were caught in a freak April snowstorm that
sent temperatures plummeting. Like many others crossing unlawfully, the
victims were woefully unprepared for the cold. Some wore sneakers and
T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, three others died during a winter storm in a neighboring
section of the national forest.</TE>
<TE>   "They may be hiking out there in the hills for two or three days and
then they get caught in these storm events," said Nelson Dean, district
ranger for the Descanso area. "They get wet in the lower elevations and
then climb up and get into the colder and snowy conditions. Then they get
into trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Dean said the illegal crossers often hesitate to summon help. "We've
found people that literally died along highways that are well-traveled,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The number of deaths here jumped as the mountains became a popular
smuggling route in response to the U.S. government campaign to reinforce
the border near San Diego beginning in 1994. The fatalities, and a sharp
rise in the number of forest fires, prompted authorities to form a border
council made up of local, state and federal agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Border Patrol launched special snow-rescue squads, and upon
word of bad weather, teams of forest rangers now patrol back roads in
search of imperiled migrants.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say those efforts are paying off. Last winter, there were no
reported hypothermia deaths in the national forest, which covers 302,000
acres in San Diego County. At least 180 people were rescued, most of them
in the mountains, according to the Border Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   The Border Patrol knows about the new winter stations but is staying
neutral.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd rather the migrants not cross in that area at all," said Raleigh
Leonard, an agency spokesman in San Diego. "It's a huge humanitarian
effort, but we don't want to give these migrants a false sense of
security."</TE>
<TE>   Morones and Hunter hope to install 20 to 25 stations by the end of
February. They are awaiting federal permission before putting any more on
national forest land. The volunteers also have approached the Kumeyaay
tribe in hopes of placing some kits on reservation land nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Morones concedes that migrants in danger may never spot the stations
amid the vast and rugged landscape. He acknowledges, too, that only
changes in immigration policy will likely alter the deadly phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   "In the meantime," he said during the canyon hike, "we've got to be
doing something."</TE>

<HD>Subpoenaed Inmates Use System for Reprisals</HD>
<DH>Prison: Mexican Mafia leaders take advantage of less-strict county
jails. A crackdown is underway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For years, the Mexican Mafia leaders in a Northern California state
prison who have been called as witnesses in Los Angeles criminal trials
have enjoyed a side benefit.</LD>
<LD>   They are temporarily held in county jails, where they have recruited
new members and carried out violent reprisals against enemies, state and
county officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The practice has come under scrutiny after the recent attempted
murders of Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies in downtown Los Angeles
and the North County jail in Castaic. The attacks, carried out with
homemade shanks, were apparently in response to a crackdown on a visiting
Mafia delegation.</LD>
<TE>   "It could happen to any county jail in the state and it has," said Lt.
Pat Hunter, the head of the North County jail. "We're going to do what we
need to do to keep staff and inmates safe."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the Mexican Mafia's leadership is imprisoned at Pelican Bay
State Prison's 1,150-inmate security housing unit in Crescent City, near
the Oregon border. Their only contact with the outside world is through
the mail and during visiting hours--both of which are monitored by
corrections officers.</TE>
<TE>   When called to testify, they are housed in the local county jail
system. In Los Angeles, they have been generally separated from the
general population, but they haven't always been subjected to the same
kinds of restrictions imposed at Pelican Bay, said Capt. Richard Adams,
who runs the county's Men's Central Jail.</TE>
<TE>   Some inmates, he said, have been allowed to make phone calls, while
others have fraternized with their Southern California associates.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the county jail system has tightened its policies,
Adams said. "Whatever privileges they do not get in state prison, they
will not get when they come here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Two months ago, half a dozen Mexican Mafia leaders were subpoenaed as
character witnesses in Los Angeles area trials. After catching wind of
the visit, sheriff's deputies severely restricted the movements of the
leaders, and split them among the Men's Central Jail, the Castaic lockup
and a nearby state prison.</TE>
<TE>   As payback for the surprise crackdown, Mafia-affiliated gang members
ambushed three sheriff's deputies on the morning of Nov. 28 with homemade
shanks at the Inmate Reception Center downtown, deputies said.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks later, on Dec. 10, an inmate slashed Deputy Chris Varela's
neck with a razor blade in the North County jail.</TE>
<TE>   The three deputies downtown suffered minor injuries, as did Varela,
who was protected from more serious harm by his plastic collar stay,
Hunter said. All have returned to work.</TE>
<TE>   Varela's attacker, 27-year-old Antonio Haro, and three of the downtown
assailants were charged with attempted murder of a peace officer,
sheriff's officials said. The other five inmates downtown were charged
with conspiracy to commit murder on a peace officer, said Capt. Richard
Barrantes of the Inmate Reception Center.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter said the fear of future reprisals remains his top concern at
the 3,500-inmate North County jail, 37 miles north of downtown Los
Angeles. Two less serious assaults on deputies have occurred in the last
two weeks, said North County jail Det. (cq) Dennis Salazar, who said they
were probably Mafia-related. Like most prison gangs, the Mexican
Mafia--also known as "La Eme" for the Spanish letter "M"--relies on
street gang members to carry out its illegal activities. It's also a
classic extortion racket that taxes drug proceeds in exchange for
protection in prison, said Special Agent Devan Hawkes, a Mexican Mafia
expert with the California Department of Corrections.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Superior Court officials would not comment on the use of
subpoenas.</TE>
<TE>   And though some law enforcement officials suspect certain defense
attorneys know what they're doing when they call these gang witnesses,
they seem resigned to the fact that the courts can't do much.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Sheriff's Chief Taylor K. Moorehead and other law
enforcement officials say there's little they can do to stop prison gang
members from moving about the state through what they allege is an abuse
of the subpoena power.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. John Portillo noted that defense attorneys have
broad discretion when it comes to issuing subpoenas.</TE>
<TE>   "A witness just has to be called on a relevant issue," he said. "And
the competency of the character witness to testify isn't determined until
he's called into court."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Potter, a Pasadena-based attorney who has represented a number of
alleged Mexican Mafia members, said good defense attorneys don't let
their clients abuse the subpoena power. Potter said he sends
investigators to all potential witnesses in prison to determine if they
will be a legitimate help to the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a travel agent--I'm a defense lawyer," Potter said. "My only
interest is in who [potential witnesses] can assist me in defending the
client from the charges on the table."</TE>
<TE>   Moorehead said a number of county corrections departments have gotten
wise to the scheme. "What [gang members] are now finding," Moorehead
said, "is an inhospitable system."</TE>

<HD>Checking for a Ticket to Ride</HD>
<DH>* LAPD's Fare Evasion Task Force is cracking down on criminals
using the Metro Red Line subway in Hollywood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Checking for small, yellow tickets, two police officers walked
through the subway train as it pushed out of Hollywood. Everyone obliged.
Then the officers stopped beside a bone-thin man wearing a black
skullcap. He extended empty hands. No ticket.</LD>
<LD>   When the train stopped, the Los Angeles Police Department officers
escorted the man onto a subway platform. He didn't have identification.
The officers grew suspicious. He nervously gave his name. He admitted
being in a gang--and had a tattoo on his chest to prove it--but said that
he'd never been convicted of a crime.</LD>
<LD>   Jackpot, thought Officer Joel Miller, part of an LAPD sweep to keep
criminals from using the Metro Rail subway to do their dirty work. "He's
lying."</LD>
<TE>   Miller used psychology, telling the man that he could be arrested and
that if his fingerprints showed he was lying--about his name or
record--big-time trouble could be coming.</TE>
<TE>   The man 'fessed up, gave another name and his gang alias--Thug. He
admitted that he is an ex-con. Miller gave Thug a lecture on telling the
truth--and a $250 ticket. "Thanks, officer," the man replied.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Miller explained what he saw as the effectiveness of the
encounter. "That guy goes back, tells his fellow gang members we're out
here--a point gets driven home," said Miller, an ex-Marine with a slight
Mississippi drawl. "Don't try to use the subway for any kind of
wrongdoing."</TE>
<TE>   Worried that criminals are using the subway to target Hollywood--an
area spending hundreds of millions to boost tourism--the LAPD last spring
launched a series of aggressive sweeps through the area's underground.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed the Fare Evasion Task Force, the sweeps saturate Red Line
subway stations with officers on the lookout for scofflaws, often using
the failure to have a ticket as a pretext for running identification and
criminal background checks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's simple," said Deputy Chief Dave Kalish, who compares the sweeps
with successful similar efforts in several East Coast cities. "We're
using the fare laws to crack down on criminality, much as in New York.
Criminals aren't paying their fares, that's just common sense. This is a
good way to find them."</TE>
<TE>   Although the American Civil Liberties Union thinks
otherwise--questioning whether police are overstepping their bounds--in
Hollywood you'd be hard-pressed to find skeptics. Most business owners
and residents say only good can come of the police taking proactive
measures to stop crime.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of creating a task force began when police noticed an uptick
in crime after the June 2000 opening of two Metropolitan Transportation
Authority subway stops on Hollywood Boulevard--one near the corner of
Vine Street, the other at Highland Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   The stop at the Hollywood and Highland intersection is an urban
planner's dream--and a huge concern for police.</TE>
<TE>   Riders spill out at the entrance of what city officials hope will be
the engine driving an economic make-over: the massive Hollywood &amp;
Highland shopping center and entertainment complex. Opened in November at
a cost of $615 million, the sprawl of high-end shops and restaurants
wraps around the 3,600-seat Ford Theater, the new home of the Academy
Awards. "That's the city's new Crystal Palace," Hollywood Division Capt.
Michael Downing said. "We'll do whatever we can to protect it."</TE>
<TE>   Compared with much of the city, Hollywood's crime rate is low, and the
MTA's subway system is regarded as one of the nation's safest.</TE>
<TE>   But in the months before the opening of Hollywood &amp; Highland, as
police surveyed statistics near the mall, an upward trend made them
nervous.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout 2001, the number of serious crimes--mainly robberies and
assaults--rose steadily. Four such crimes occurred in the area in the
first quarter of the year, 10 in the second quarter, followed by 16 from
July through September. Adding to their worry, police knew that overall
serious crime throughout Hollywood was up slightly compared with the
previous year.</TE>
<TE>   The capper came when Downing's officers began telling him that the Red
Line seemed to be carrying a significant number of known criminals,
ex-cons and parole violators into Hollywood, a surge that police admit is
difficult to quantify but that they are certain of nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   One officer said he can usually spot an ex-con by tattoos, physical
bearing or the way they look police in the eye. "With no fear. They
bird-dog you. We were getting a lot of guys like that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So last spring, the Hollywood Division and the LAPD's transit police
began running their task force, staging patrols about once a month.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent night, about three dozen officers met inside the Hollywood
Division station for roll call before beginning another sweep. A few were
in street clothes, dressed in jeans and baseball caps, members of the
undercover unit.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to keep making our presence felt," Downing said.</TE>
<TE>   He outlined goals for the evening: Roam the subway, run background
checks on those without tickets and identification, keep any kind of
criminal element riding the Red Line on its toes.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight, we're all over the place," Officer Miller said as he rode an
escalator into the subway at Western Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   While some officers, such as Miller and partner Eric Yerkey, took to
the trains, others waited on the mezzanine levels and near ticket booths.</TE>
<TE>   Miller and Yerkey are transit officers whose job is patrolling the
subway, cruising the platforms and scouring the labyrinth-like system of
tunnels.</TE>
<TE>   As they rode the subway in the Hollywood area, most trains were about
half full. It was just before Christmas, and many riders were on their
way to shop. Considering that the MTA runs its subway system on an honor
system--there are no turnstiles to check fares as in San Francisco or New
York--an astonishing number of people had their tickets.</TE>
<TE>   One who didn't was Thug. Another was a man whom Miller and Yerkey
stopped as he left Hollywood. After running a background check, the
officers found that he was wanted for a robbery in New York. When they
arrested the man, they found that he was hiding crack cocaine in his
underwear.</TE>
<TE>   By night's end, the task force was proclaimed successful by Officer
Michael Shea, responsible for coordinating the sweep. Fifty-two people
were ticketed for minor infractions. Three riders were arrested for
outstanding warrants. The man caught with crack was the only felony
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   The presence of officers clearly pleased most riders, scores of whom
smiled at the police and offered up their tickets without prompting.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just nice to see them down here. They are friendly and know
about the system if you have questions," said Hilda Ramirez, a young
mother.</TE>
<TE>   Yet not everyone is equally enamored. The ACLU expressed reservations
about the sweeps. ACLU lawyer Dan Tokaji said he thinks that in most
instances police don't have the right to run background checks on fare
evaders because they don't have probable cause.</TE>
<TE>   "When they go beyond just checking for tickets," Tokaji said, "they
clearly run into very serious constitutional problems."</TE>
<TE>   Emboldened by a business community clamoring for safe streets, and by
recent projections showing crime around the subways has dropped slightly,
the LAPD has no plans to stop.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a right to ask for tickets; we do it to everyone, and we
don't see any part of the process as a problem," Downing said, adding
that the background checks are the same as when police pull a driver over
for a traffic violation. "The most important thing, we feel this is going
to work."</TE>

<HD>Local Accident Spawns Tougher State Drunk-Driving Law</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the holiday season winds down today, law enforcement officials
are preparing for new state laws that aim to decrease the numbers of
drunk-driving deaths in 2002.</LD>
<LD>   "We're cracking down and we have zero tolerance for people driving
impaired on our roads," Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa
Barbara) said at a news conference Monday at Ventura's California Highway
Patrol headquarters. "We take these problems very seriously."</LD>
<LD>   One law taking effect this year, sponsored by Jackson, was inspired by
a Ventura County case. Under the law, drunk-driving convictions in which
someone is killed or seriously injured will permanently remain on the
driver's record. Previously, if no drunk-driving offense was committed in
10 years, a driver's record could be wiped clean.</LD>
<TE>   Known as "Joshua's Law," it stems from the case of Diane Mannes, who
killed three young men in 1989 while driving drunk on the Ventura
Freeway. One of those killed was 19-year-old Joshua Oxenreider.</TE>
<TE>   Mannes was arrested again in 2000 after officers found her driving
with a .28 blood-alcohol level--more than three times the legal limit.
But prosecutors had to treat her as a first-time offender with lesser
charges because the vehicular manslaughter conviction was more than a
decade old. She was sentenced to six months in jail last February.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Oxenreider, Joshua's mother and the state chairwoman for Mothers
Against Drunk Driving, and Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury
pushed for the new penalties. Oxenreider said she hopes the new
legislation will prevent repeat drunk-driving offenses.</TE>
<TE>   "At least Joshua's death isn't in vain, because his name is in the
laws of California," said Oxenreider, a Camarillo resident.</TE>
<TE>   CHP officers in Ventura County made 1,530 drunk-driving arrests in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   And drunk drivers were involved in 253 accidents investigated by the
CHP, including crashes that injured 154 people and killed eight.</TE>
<TE>   Another law taking effect today requires that all children 6 years old
and younger or weighing less than 60 pounds be strapped into child-safety
seats, Jackson said. Previously, the cutoff for safety seats was 4 years
old or 40 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   The change stems from studies that have shown a disproportionate
number of children ages 4 to 7 are injured or killed in car accidents.
More than 47% of the children in those studies were not restrained in car
booster seats, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.</TE>
<TE>   The new law will require more than 1.1 million children in the state
to be more safely secured in vehicles, Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is critical, and we're going to save a number of lives with it,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   CHP Capt. Scott MacGregor said the law is also indirectly linked to
the agency's goal of reducing the number of fatalities, particularly
among children, in drunk-driving accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Parents may need to purchase a new booster seat to comply with the
regulations. Fines are $250 for the first offense and $675 for the
second, MacGregor said.</TE>

<HD>County Bank Robberies Up During 2001</HD>
<DH>Crime: The 'Both Hands Bandit,' blamed for eight heists, helped
push the total to 29 last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSE CARDENAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County's busiest bank robber of 2001 is called the "Both
Hands Bandit" by the FBI because he gingerly displays his holdup notes to
tellers with both hands, one at each corner.</LD>
<LD>   Since August, he has been responsible for eight bank robberies in
Ventura County, according to police.</LD>
<LD>   And thanks to him, local bank robberies increased to 29, topping the
previous year's total by seven, according to FBI Special Agent Brent
Robbins.</LD>
<TE>   "He's slick," said Robbins, "but we're working on him."</TE>
<TE>   In security-camera images, the man appears to be as young as in his
40s or as old as in his 60s. He is described as white, with a pale
complexion, 5-feet-10 to 6 feet tall, with graying blond hair and blue
eyes. He wears prescription glasses.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Ventura County robberies, the Both Hands Bandit is
blamed for a Santa Barbara bank holdup last month.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say they're confident the Both Hands Bandit--a man brazen
enough to rob the same bank and even the same teller twice--will soon be
caught.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say this will be the last Christmas he should enjoy in
freedom-land," Robbins said.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 26, the man robbed the Goleta National Bank on South Victoria
Avenue in Ventura. Three days later, he returned, presenting a holdup
note to the same teller.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi, it's me again," he told her. "I'm back."</TE>
<TE>   Police have solved nine of the county's bank robberies this year. Last
year, they solved 14.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the whimsical names applied by the FBI to bank robbers with
distinctive traits, the incidents can terrify employees and customers.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, three masked men dressed in black barged into a Bank of
America branch in Thousand Oaks, screaming for everyone inside to get
down. Two of the men leaped over the counter while the third kept watch
over the customers. At least one of the men brandished a gun.</TE>
<TE>   The robbers may have been members of a Los Angeles street gang, which
is believed to have hit the same branch twice the previous year,
according to police.</TE>
<TE>   Banks in Thousand Oaks were robbed five times in 2001, down from nine
times in 2000. Close to Los Angeles and just off the Ventura Freeway, the
city has been a frequent target for bank robbers in the past. City
officials have credited the recent decrease to a task force set up in
March 2000, after banks in the Conejo Valley were hit seven times in less
than a month.</TE>
<TE>   This year, more bank robberies occurred in Ventura than any other area
city. Five of Ventura's eight bank robberies are alleged by federal
authorities to be the work of the Both Hands Bandit.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the county, Camarillo and Oxnard each had four bank
robberies. Port Hueneme had three. Simi Valley and Westlake had two each,
and Ojai had one.</TE>
<TE>   The total pales next to the</TE>
<TE>   county's record high in 1992. That year, there were 97 bank robberies,
or an average of about one every three days. In 1999--the safest year for
the county's banks--the average was just one robbery a month.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have made seven arrests related to this year's heists.</TE>
<TE>   One of the suspects arrested was Jeremy Lopez, 32. Authorities believe
he was the "To Go Bandit," a robber who motioned tellers to deposit the
money in a paper bag. Lopez, who allegedly held up a Bank of America
branch in Simi Valley on Feb. 15, was arrested in Burbank after a robbery
there, according to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Police also arrested Keith Armstrong, 40, and Star Premmer, 19, after
the Feb. 20 holdup of a Washington Mutual branch in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong and Premmer, both of Los Angeles, were apprehended after a
car chase that shut down the Ventura Freeway. Two other suspects in a
separate car got away.</TE>
<TE>   In the March 21 robbery of a Washington Mutual branch in Camarillo,
authorities arrested Gordon Myers, 36, of Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, a Bank of America in Ventura was robbed, and
authorities determined that Alfonso Delgado, 25, of Ventura, was
responsible. Delgado, a suspect in the killing of a grocery clerk during
the robbery of a Ventura Avenue market, was killed a few weeks later
during a standoff with police.</TE>
<TE>   A Western Financial branch in Thousand Oaks was robbed April 19, and
authorities charged William Phillips, 53, of Los Angeles. They believe
Phillips is a robber known as "Mumbles" for the quiet way he spoke to
bank tellers. Phillips was arrested in Los Angeles for his alleged
involvement in a string of robberies there.</TE>
<TE>   In June, police also arrested James Beltran, 33. They allege that he
robbed Bank of America branches in Ventura and Port Hueneme and a Cal Fed
branch in Port Hueneme--all within a few days.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, police arrested Camarillo brothers Peter and Anthony
Hislar, 21 and 20, respectively, after the Sept. 25 robbery of a Bank of
America branch.</TE>

<HD>66 California Restaurant Is 86'd From Ventura Building</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: The popular gathering spot for musicians and music
lovers is closing.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The 66 California closed early this morning after 15 years in
business, striking a sad chord for jazz lovers who gathered regularly at
the downtown Ventura restaurant and nightclub.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we're going to be sadly deprived of jazz in this area," said
Bob Agnew, a Port Hueneme resident who writes columns for the monthly
L.A. Jazz Scene newspaper and is a regular patron of the club. "I hung
out there because I met so many great musicians from all over."</LD>
<LD>   Club owner Frank Parong said property owner Gil Levy, a former Ventura
resident who now lives in Las Vegas, notified him Dec. 10 that Levy was
selling the building and needed Parong to leave within 30 days. Parong
scrambled to come up with the $900,000 asking price, but couldn't.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm just kind of numb," Parong said Monday as he prepared for the
club's last New Year's Eve party.</TE>
<TE>   Agnew said there's a restaurant in Oak Park that also offers jazz
regularly, but there isn't anything else in Ventura County comparable to
the Ventura club. It attracted musicians from Los Angeles and beyond.
Featured performers included the Ink Spots and the late saxophonist
Harold Land.</TE>
<TE>   As word spread over the weekend that the new year would mark the
nightclub's end, fans flocked for their final fix of jazz at 66
California. Like every other night, there was no cover for the New Year's
Eve finale, when the Kelly Joe Jones blues band performed.</TE>
<TE>   "We did blues last night and the place was just packed," Parong said
Monday afternoon. "Maybe it was just a last hurrah, but it was a very
nice feeling."</TE>
<TE>   The closure also leaves a void for musicians, said bassist Henry
Franklin, whose trio was the first act to perform at the restaurant when
it started offering music eight years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It kind of hurts to see another jazz club go down, especially because
of all the love and the effort Frank put into it," Franklin said.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin, who lives in Perris, near Riverside, drove 140 miles each
way to play every weekend for five years because he liked the club,
Parong and the customers.</TE>
<TE>   "The audience was so attentive it was unbelievable," Franklin said.
"You could almost hear a pin drop because everybody was listening."</TE>
<TE>   It was memories of fun nights at an old jazz club called Charlie's, on
the Ventura Promenade, that prompted Parong to begin booking musicians at
his restaurant. The Banana Boat Cantina was the most recent club in
Charlie's old building, and now it has also closed.</TE>
<TE>   Parong said he sees more jazz in Ventura's future.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's only a temporary situation, and I think that Ventura
will bounce back with another jazz club or someone will do something
similar," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Parong, 46, doesn't know what he'll do now, although he would like to
stay in the business. An electrician before he opened 66 California,
Parong said he would have made more money and had more free time if he
stayed with that career. But despite the struggles he enjoyed running a
restaurant more than fixing wires.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved the restaurant business, the people and being able to create
what I created for so long," Parong said. "It was fun."</TE>

<HD>War Gets in Way of Recruiting</HD>
<DH>Education: Overseas conflicts are very much on the minds of
applicants to military academies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Being a cadet at a U.S. service academy has its perks: a free
college education, a monthly stipend and a crisp uniform for mom to
admire on trips home. But that package comes with a price--five years of
military service beyond college--that might not seem so alluring these
days.</LD>
<LD>   "War is not necessarily a good advertisement" for the military
academies, said Aaron Barreda, 24, who graduated from the U.S. Military
Academy at West Point, N.Y., and is now a lieutenant in the Army.</LD>
<LD>   Barreda, other service academy graduates and current cadets gathered
last week at the office of Rep. Howard Berman (D-Mission Hills) to
promote the schools to prospective applicants. Members of Congress are
among those who nominate candidates for admission to the nation's five
service academies: West Point, the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., the
Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo., the Coast Guard Academy in
New London, Conn., and the Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, N.Y.</LD>
<TE>   "In past years we've talked about it being a dangerous world, but this
year we know how dangerous a world it is," Berman told the handful of
students seeking his support for their applications. "This is a really
important thing that you're doing, and you're going to be the leaders by
virtue of your academy service."</TE>
<TE>   America's war in Afghanistan and the possibility that the conflict
might spread elsewhere are on the minds of high school seniors going
through the academies' lengthy application process.</TE>
<TE>   "The Air Force Academy is the best way for me to do what I want to
do," said Chris Culberson of North Hollywood, who wants to be an
astronaut. "It's still worth it in light of the recent events."</TE>
<TE>   Chris' father, who considered joining the Air Force until the Vietnam
War broke out, feels better about his son's choice knowing that today's
military jets fly higher, faster and can hit their targets from farther
away.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not as apprehensive . . . as we would be if he were a soldier
on the ground," Harvey Culberson said.</TE>
<TE>   Enrolling at an academy insulates cadets from active service for the
four years they are studying.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like being in a closed environment," said Lord Cole, who
just finished his first semester and first football season at the Naval
Academy.</TE>
<TE>   His classmate, George O'Garro, who is playing basketball for Navy,
said the possibility of being deployed to a war zone after graduation
rarely crosses his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I'm not going anywhere for a couple of years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Upon graduation, though, academy cadets become commissioned officers
and face five years of active duty. Applicants sometimes discount that,
Barreda said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nine years of a career--it's a long time in any occupation," he said.</TE>

<HD>Joint Funeral Set for 2 Teens</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joint viewings and funeral services have been planned for two
Westlake High School students who were killed last week when their car
spun out of control and slammed into a brick wall.</LD>
<LD>   There will be open casket viewings from 1 to 5 p.m. today for Kenneth
Marshall Glass and Jordan Alexander Bass at Pierce Bros. Valley Oaks
Mortuary in Westlake Village.</LD>
<LD>   A double funeral for the two 16-year-olds will take place at 11 a.m.
Wednesday at Calvary Community Church in Westlake Village.</LD>
<TE>   The public is invited to both services, and several hundred high
school students are expected to attend.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tightknit community, and we are all grieving," funeral
director Victoria Burke said.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth and Jordan, both of Westlake Village, died at the scene of the
crash, which occurred about 1 a.m. Friday on Westlake Boulevard near
Hillcrest Drive.</TE>
<TE>   The cause remains under investigation, but excessive speed was a
factor, Ventura County sheriff's authorities have said.</TE>
<TE>   Two passengers in the station wagon driven by Kenneth survived.</TE>
<TE>   Joshua Kuai, 16, of Westlake Village was in good condition Monday at
UCLA Medical Center. Jenae Chu, 16, of Thousand Oaks was being treated
for fractures at a Woodland Hills hospital. Her condition was not
available.</TE>
<TE>   "The families decided to have joint funerals because the boys shared
so many of the same friends," Burke said.</TE>
<TE>   Burke said the families opted to open the services to the public as a
way to advocate safe driving.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth was a member of the Westlake High School varsity basketball
team, and Jordan was an avid golfer who hoped to play competitively at
UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have said Jordan was wearing a seat belt, but they are
unsure whether Kenneth or the other passengers were.</TE>

<HD>Pedestrian Fatalities Rising in the Valley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The weekend death of a 19-year-old man hit by a Metro Rapid bus is
the latest in a trend of rising pedestrian fatalities in the San Fernando
Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities say they do not know why Myron Wise ran in front of a bus,
against a red light, Thursday night as it cruised through a Woodland
Hills intersection. The Van Nuys man became the 38th Valley pedestrian
casualty in 2001 when he died Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   In four years, pedestrian casualties have been steadily decreasing in
other parts of Los Angeles, but in the Valley the death toll has more
than doubled from 17 in 1998 to 38 in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Much of that increase, officials say, can be blamed on pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   "People are jaywalking like crazy," said Capt. Greg Meyer of the Los
Angeles Police Department's Valley Traffic Division. "It's completely out
of control."</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Valley pedestrians were at fault in one of every four
traffic fatalities, police said. But those on foot are now at fault about
half the time--either by jaywalking or crossing on a red light.</TE>
<TE>   Wise ran into the path of the westbound bus about 10:20 p.m. Thursday
as he was crossing Ventura Boulevard near Canoga Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Ubaldo, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, said he could not comment on the incident because it is under
investigation. The bus driver, 39-year-old Mandep Sagoo, has been
employed by the agency for nine years and is currently on medical leave,
Ubaldo said.</TE>
<TE>   Agency officials could not provide bus death and injury statistics,
citing the New Year's holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Wise's family nor Sagoo could be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Officials recently launched an information and enforcement campaign to
urge greater pedestrian safety and caution.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley Traffic Division has been setting up more frequent
operations to catch drivers who violate pedestrian rights. Officers are
cracking down on jaywalkers and those who cross against a red light. At
least one community group, the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., is planning
an awareness program to help reduce pedestrian accidents.</TE>
<TE>   "People need to take responsibility for their actions," Meyer said.
"These are completely preventable tragedies."</TE>

<LD>Orange County motorists can now pay traffic fines online with a
credit card, thanks to a new service officials hope will help eliminate
the long lines of people every morning at Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   Motorists already pay fines by mail or telephone as well as in person,
said Alan Slater, Superior Court's chief executive officer. "This
[online] service is an added convenience," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County is the first county in the state to use a recently
developed program by ACS State and Local Solutions Inc. for public
agencies called Governlink III. The public can log on to the court's Web
site--http://www.occourts.org--and follow the instructions to pay fines.
There's a $4 fee.</LD>
<TE>   This is the latest online service announced by the county, which has
been rapidly improving access to everything from reserving a book at a
county library to paying property taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "For some years now, we've been trying to streamline access and create
a paperless process for the public with transactions," said Leo Crawford,
the county's chief information officer.</TE>
<TE>   The county's Web site (http://www.oc.ca.gov) has recently been revised
to make it more user-friendly, Crawford said. More services are available
through the site, such as viewing pictures of animals available for
adoption at the county animal shelter, scheduling an appointment with a
building inspector and applying for a county job.</TE>
<TE>   The clerk-recorder's office was the pioneer agency; it began
providing, for a fee, online birth, death and marriage records more than
two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The program to pay traffic fines was developed by technicians at ACS.
Mike Sinkinson, ACS' program director in Orange County, said the firm has
other projects involving Web applications and high-tech services. It has
enabled residents in San Diego and San Bernardino counties to make
property-tax payments online through Governlink, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time a county is offering to [let violators] pay
traffic fines with Governlink," Sinkinson said. "We have another system
used in major cities for paying parking tickets."</TE>
<TE>   The company has been providing online-transaction programs for about
five years and has developed a relationship with banks, Sinkinson said.
"The encryption we use is extremely secure," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When the firm bought Lockheed Martin IMS, the company also acquired
Lockheed's $260-million data-processing contract with the county.</TE>
<TE>   The contract, approved a year ago, runs through 2010.</TE>

<HD>New Year's Eve With a Ring to It</HD>
<DH>Marriage: At the Old Orange County Courthouse, Dec. 31 is 2nd only
to Valentine's Day in the number of ceremonies performed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Hall has always been a spontaneous guy. He joined the Navy on
the spur of the moment when he was 18. On Monday, 20 years later, he got
married.</LD>
<LD>   His bride learned of the plan three days ago.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought it was great, really romantic," said Andrea Trujillo, who
became Andrea Trujillo-Hall after a ceremony at the Old Orange County
Courthouse. "And I thought because it's New Year's Eve, he would never
have an excuse to forget his anniversary."</LD>
<TE>   Some people get married for love. People who get married on New Year's
Eve have additional reasons: to make a last-minute change in tax status,
perhaps, or to ring in the new year in a special way.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, New Year's Eve is the second-busiest day for marriages at the
Orange County courthouse--after Valentine's Day. Seven couples were
waiting in line when the doors opened at 8 a.m. Monday. By 4:30 p.m.,
when the doors closed, about 150 were expected to have tied the knot,
more than twice the number for an average winter day.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a popular date," said Angie Ozuna, supervisor of the county's
marriage license department. "We try to make it as special as possible."</TE>
<TE>   A courthouse wedding is a straightforward deal. You fill out some
forms and take a number. You wait. When your number is called, you sit
before one of nine deputy commissioners of marriage, who processes the
paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   "Do I have to stand?" asked No. 68, Cliff Vonting, when asked to
verify that his form was filled out accurately.</TE>
<TE>   A sign on the desk in front of him read: "Congratulations. Capture
This Special Moment." It's $6 for one Polaroid instant picture, $10 for
two.</TE>
<TE>   Vonting, 41, and his bride, 25-year-old Danielle Islas, brought a
camera. But for $28, the Garden Grove couple opted for a ceremony with
their mothers and young son in a room the size of a large walk-in closet.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to start the new year right and have that celebration of
life," Vonting said. "The 31st . . . I just like the idea of this being
the 31st."</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to have a more formal wedding," Islas added. "I want to
have a big wedding. Something more traditional. Something you dream of."</TE>
<TE>   Planning the dream wedding takes time and money. The courthouse
wedding, which ends with the couple being handed a gift packet containing
coupons, a bag of coffee and some napkins, requires neither.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Russo and David Monroe of Huntington Beach already have that
stuff. The 35-year-olds have been together for nine years and have a son,
born in February.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's just say we're procrastinators," Monroe said of his courthouse
marriage. "It's kind of cheesy; I'd be the first one to admit that."</TE>
<TE>   For Christmas, Monroe surprised Russo with a ring. On Monday, the
bride wore a flower-print skirt and lavender velour jacket. The groom
wore jeans.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the season; love is in the air," Russo said. "Everybody's happy.
And in January, we do our taxes."</TE>
<TE>   The couple's large, extended family is spread out across the nation.
There will be a big, traditional wedding sometime in 2002. Monroe will
dress up. Their parents will never know about the small wedding in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Hall and Trujillo decided on doing both at once: the quickie
courthouse marriage that over the course of a weekend also became a
family affair.</TE>
<TE>   For an extra $100, they reserved the historic second-floor courtroom
in the old stone building. On Saturday, Hall bought the rings. On Sunday,
he was fitted for a suit. The couple were still calling some of their two
dozen guests Monday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Said Hall's sister, Margaret Dowling: "When he told me last week that
he was planning this, I asked him, 'Are you sure she's going to show up?'
"</TE>
<TE>   She did. And after a ceremony they did not write themselves--"I didn't
have time; I figured I'd let them take care of that," Hall said--they
became man and wife.</TE>
<TE>   It took all of five minutes. Joining the Navy probably took longer.</TE>

<HD>Newport Coast Becomes Part of Newport Beach</HD>
<DH>Annexation: Starting today, the city will provide residents of the
gated community with fire, police and trash services, but concerns remain
on other issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 7,000 residents of Newport Coast, who dwell in expensive, gated
neighborhoods with breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean, become
citizens of Newport Beach today.</LD>
<LD>   "It brings us very close to completing the city," Newport Beach City
Councilman Gary B. Adams said. "This is a win-win for both the city and
the coast."</LD>
<LD>   Under the annexation plan, Newport Beach firefighters will move into
the Newport Coast station today and Newport Beach will take over law
enforcement from the Orange County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<TE>   City employees also will begin picking up trash and keeping medians
and parkways looking lush and green.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the city will pay off about $18 million of a county
assessment, saving the average Newport Coast homeowner $240 a year.</TE>
<TE>   For the first few years after annexation, providing these services to
Newport Coast will cost the city money. But with a projected population
of 12,000 residents by 2010, tax revenue from the coast soon will cover
the cost of those services.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some residents worry that Newport Coast, where homes sell for
millions of dollars, may be stuck with the short end of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "We're paying a lot of taxes up here, and we want to make sure we get
these moneys back," said Philip Greer, who led an unsuccessful petition
drive to block the annexation. "Are they going to be fair and bring this
area into the political mainstream?"</TE>
<TE>   Greer said he remains concerned that Newport Beach officials will fail
to respect his community's uniqueness, which he said centers on tightknit
families and good schools. He also charged that the annexation process
did not involve residents as much as he would have liked.</TE>
<TE>   Many residents are wondering, for example, what will happen to the
community's private parks, which until now have been maintained by dues
from homeowners associations. Will they become public?</TE>
<TE>   And what will officials do about planes buzzing overhead? Newport
Beach has lobbied heavily for an airport to be built at the El Toro
Marine base, in part because residents of Newport Beach's Back Bay loathe
the constant sound of jets from John Wayne Airport. But an airport at El
Toro could send planes over Newport Coast.</TE>
<TE>   City officials counter that Newport Coast residents will get better
fire and police protection as well as city services such as a community
center.</TE>
<TE>   "When the folks up there learn the details, I think they'll be
comfortable about it," Adams said.</TE>
<TE>   Even Greer admits to coming around a bit in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the city has made some positive moves to be more inclusive,"
he said. "I'm willing to give it a chance."</TE>

<HD>Malibu Pier Project Gets County Aid</HD>
<DH>Landmark: A donation of $3 million toward restoration will come
with strings attached.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to avoid the sea of controversy swirling around repairs to
the Malibu Pier, Los Angeles County officials have gingerly agreed to
donate $3 million to help the state finish renovations.</LD>
<LD>   Local leaders have attached some mooring-like strings to their gift,
however.</LD>
<LD>   Officials are mindful of the nasty feud between contractors over
repairs to the pier, damaged by a 1995 storm. So the county is requiring
state guarantees that fixes to the 95-year-old landmark are properly done
and that a permanent maintenance plan is created.</LD>
<TE>   State parks administrators say they will agree to the county's terms.</TE>
<TE>   The contribution, announced Monday by County Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky, whose district includes Malibu, will come from the
Proposition A "Save Neighborhood Parks" bond issue approved by county
voters in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   The state's Department of Parks and Recreation owns the pier and is in
the middle of a repair project that is expected to cost more than $5
million, including the county funds. The pier, with tower-like twin
clapboard buildings at the end and Alice's Restaurant at the front, was
declared unsafe and closed after being battered by a 1995 storm.</TE>
<TE>   Officials debated whether to tear down the 780-foot structure before
deciding in 1999 to repair it. But the two partners who worked on the
first portions of the job soon had a falling-out.</TE>
<TE>   The duo argued over specifications, selection of subcontractors, and
the quality of materials and workmanship before builder Bruce Darian
began secretly taping conversations with partner Ron Federico.</TE>
<TE>   Darian obtained a restraining order against Federico after going to
court with recordings that allegedly contained a warning from his partner
that "you're going to end up on the ocean floor with cement boots on."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Darian was arrested and jailed 30 hours for vandalism after
Federico complained that he had spray-painted Xs on replacement pier
pilings that Darian alleged were substandard.</TE>
<TE>   Federico, a Lakeview Terrace contractor, has denied threatening
Darian. But Darian, of Hermosa Beach, has filed a federal complaint
alleging conspiracy, racketeering and "retaliation against a
whistle-blower" against his former partner and others--including the
state parks agency.</TE>
<TE>   County officials indicated they were prepared in 2000 to give the
state the $2.9-million allocation, which will be accompanied by a
$700,000 Proposition A disbursement through the city of Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   But "certain provisions" have changed since then and "it is prudent
for the county to require the state to perform certain obligations that
are beyond the standard terms of a Proposition A grant," according to
Stan Wisniewski, director of the county's Department of Beaches and
Harbors.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the repair and maintenance requirements, the county will
require that the state spend its own money first on the pier project
before dipping into the Proposition A funds. The state also must provide
free space for county lifeguards on the pier.</TE>
<TE>   Hayden Sohm, Malibu area superintendent for the state Department of
Parks and Recreation, said he understands the county's concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a concern in terms of confidence. We brought in our
architects and planners and made clear they understand our vision and
where we're going," he said Monday.</TE>

<HD>Longtime L.A. Jewish Leader Is Dismissed</HD>
<DH>Dispute: David Lehrer was with the Anti-Defamation League for 27
years. Community expresses anger.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES RELIGION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Lehrer, the Los Angeles regional director of the
Anti-Defamation League, has been abruptly dismissed from his post after
27 years with the nation's premier Jewish civil rights organization.</LD>
<LD>   The dismissal, delivered Dec. 21 in New York by the league's national
director, Abraham Foxman, drew immediate statements of shock, sadness and
outrage Monday from Jewish community members in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   It was not clear why Lehrer was dismissed, and he said he was
"stunned" by the news. The ADL's New York offices were closed Monday, but
the organization released a statement last week to the Jewish Journal
saying that Lehrer would be leaving the league in connection with
"undertaking steps to strengthen our leadership and development efforts"
in the Los Angeles regional office.</LD>
<TE>   "I am blown away," said Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky,
who called for a review of the league's personnel decisions. "David
Lehrer's outstanding reputation and his summary dismissal without warning
do not compute. A lot of us are resentful because this decision was made
by someone in New York without apparent consultation with the lay board
of directors locally."</TE>
<TE>   Jewish community members said Foxman and Lehrer had long had personal
and political differences. In part, they said, the tension between the
two reflected a struggle between Los Angeles and New York, American
Jewry's historical center, over which would set the community's national
direction.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, some of Lehrer's differences with national leaders
surfaced in his relations with Muslims. Lehrer was one of the first area
Jewish leaders to step forward and forge a code of ethics with Muslim
leaders to civilize debate between the two sides in 1998. He also was
known to differ with the national league's opposition to Los Angeles
Muslim leader Salam Al-Marayati's appointment to a national
counterterrorism commission. (Al-Marayati's nomination was subsequently
withdrawn after Jewish opposition.)</TE>
<TE>   "Probably he is paying the price for the more balanced view he took
toward Muslims," said Aslam Abdullah, vice president of the Muslim Public
Affairs Council.</TE>
<TE>   In his wide-ranging human relations work, Lehrer forged broad ties
with politicians, the media, law enforcement and ethnic communities. He
helped initiate programs to bring non-Jewish students of color to Israel,
educate 100,000 Southern California teachers about stereotyping and
bigotry, and develop business ties between Latinos and Jews.</TE>
<TE>   "Every ethnic group has the tendency to be insular, but David has,
more than anyone else, sensed what L.A. is all about and begun programs
to get the Jewish community out there in the larger world," said Faith
Cookler, an Anti-Defamation League past president and national
commissioner. Cookler said the league's local board of directors planned
to meet on the issue Wednesday and would release a statement then.</TE>
<TE>   Lehrer also helped write the state's first statute against hate crimes
and made the league the premier information center on extremist
organizations, ranging from white supremacists to the Jewish Defense
League. Recently, on the day that JDL chief Irv Rubin was arrested on
charges of conspiring to blow up a mosque, the Anti-Defamation League
disseminated a 25-page report documenting the group's long history of
violence.</TE>
<TE>   During his tenure, Lehrer helped expand the league's Western
operations, with satellite offices in Santa Barbara, the San Fernando
Valley and Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "David Lehrer will be extraordinarily difficult to replace because of
all the people, both Jewish and non-Jewish, who respect him," said Rabbi
Lawrence Goldmark, executive director of the Pacific Assn. of Reform
Rabbis.</TE>

<HD>Deputy Is Attacked by Suspected Hair Bandit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man who appears to be the person police have dubbed the "hair
bandit" attempted to run down a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy with
his car Monday morning, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The confrontation began at about 8:30 a.m. when the deputy saw a man
holding a woman in a chokehold at a pay phone near Whittier Boulevard and
Leonard Street in East Los Angeles. Relying on a tip, police later
identified the man as Michael Howard, 46, of Norwalk.</LD>
<LD>   The deputy chased Howard in his patrol car and Howard climbed into a
1991 gray Buick Riviera parked in a nearby alley. When the deputy
approached the car on foot, the man pressed the accelerator and attempted
to hit the deputy, Lt. Larry Lincoln said.</LD>
<TE>   The deputy, who jumped out of the way, fired three to four rounds as
the man drove off. Investigators said they could not confirm whether the
suspect was wounded and would not release the deputy's name. The woman
was not injured.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said there is a possibility that Howard is the hair bandit,
who has struck repeatedly over the last few weeks in Long Beach and
nearby cities. There were large chunks of brown hair and a pair of
scissors left at the scene of the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "Our detectives are working with the sheriffs and sharing
information," said Long Beach Police Sgt. Steve Filippini.</TE>
<TE>   The hair bandit has been described as white, 5-foot-10 to 6-foot-3,
with a heavy build, sandy blond or light brown hair, and a small mustache
and goatee. The man does not take any money, but grabs women by their
hair from behind and uses a knife or scissors to cut large portions of
their hair.</TE>
<TE>   Howard matches some of the physical descriptions.</TE>

said Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Brian Jordan.</LD>

<HD>Cyber Cafe Slaying May Lead to New Regulations</HD>
<DH>Violence: Police say the Orange County assault is just the latest
in a string of problems at the spots frequented by teens and some gang
members.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Police are stepping up patrols and seeking new laws aimed at
halting a string of violent incidents at late-night cyber cafes in
central Orange County, including the death early Monday of a 20-year-old
man attacked while waiting to play a video game.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of cyber cafes have opened in Garden Grove and surrounding
cities, bustling through the night with teenagers who come to access the
Internet and play the latest video games. But the late-night venues have
increasingly drawn gang members and other teens looking for trouble,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Garden Grove and Santa Ana have been the hardest hit, reporting more
than a dozen assaults, stabbings and robberies in recent months at the
cafes. This weekend's attack marked the first slaying, and Garden Grove
authorities said they will ask the City Council to pass ordinances more
strictly regulating the cafes and limiting the hours when teens can
patronize them.</LD>
<TE>   "It's always alarming when you have this type of increase in
violence," Garden Grove Police Sgt. Mike Handfield said. "We've tried to
be active, but there's only so much you can do."</TE>
<TE>   Phuong Huu Ly and a friend arrived at PC Cafe around 8:35 p.m. Sunday,
intending to spend the evening playing video games for $2 an hour, police
said. As they entered, they spotted two boys around 16 years old watching
them from inside, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The cafe, which stays open until 4 a.m., was full, so Ly and his
friend smoked a cigarette outside as they waited for a computer to become
available. A few minutes later, the two teenage boys from inside
confronted them, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the boys pulled a large screwdriver he had tucked into his
waistband and stabbed Ly in the head, police said. The assailants ran,
yelling gang names as they jumped into a light green Honda Accord and
sped east on Garden Grove Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Ly, of Santa Ana, was pronounced dead 7 1/2 hours later at UC Irvine
Medical Center. Police identified him as a "gang associate," and said
they suspect the slaying was motivated by gang rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   Though Garden Grove police have not kept statistics, officials said
they have noticed a steady rise in violence at the city's 19 cyber cafes.
Gang detectives, in particular, have spent extra time scouting out the
cafes in search of troublemakers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to get up to speed," Handfield said. "We didn't
anticipate this many problems."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's assault follows recent episodes at the same cafe, which has
seen more problems than most, Handfield said. In November, a dispute
between two game-players quickly turned into a melee, as four teenagers
wielded baseball bats in the middle of the cafe. Two people were
seriously injured.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks earlier, a gang-related brawl at the cafe ended in a
stabbing that police are treating as an attempted murder case.</TE>
<TE>   Monday afternoon, the only violence at PC Cafe was on computer screens
as dozens of teenage boys fought one another in a popular computer game
that pits heavily armed terrorists against even more heavily armed
police.</TE>
<TE>   As the sound of shots and explosions rang out around him, Fernando
Padilla Jr., 18, took a short break from his game to say the cafe has
been unfairly maligned.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a gang hangout," said Padilla, who plays for three hours
daily. "There are 5-year-old kids who come in and they've got skill."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Woo, a part-owner of PC Cafe, also defended it. He pointed to a
list of rules he said are strictly enforced. Computer users are forbidden
from cursing, yelling and running.</TE>
<TE>   Mounted surveillance cameras watch inside and behind the cafe, and Woo
said he plans to add another camera this week outside the store's front,
where Ly was killed.</TE>
<TE>   But Woo acknowledged that fights occasionally break out. Some
game-players, he said, get carried away and resort to real violence. And
he expressed frustration at his unsuccessful efforts to exclude gang
members.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing we can do to tell they're gang members," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The burgeoning popularity of cyber cafes like Woo's has fueled a rapid
expansion across the region. But in Garden Grove, at least, city
officials will likely make it harder to operate them, officials said.</TE>

<HD>A Merry New Year at Magic Kingdom</HD>
<DH>Party: Thousands of celebrants unfazed by tighter security ring in
2002 at Disneyland and, for the first time, California Adventure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tens of thousands of New Year's Eve celebrants packed Disneyland on
Monday night, unfazed by heightened security that included front-gate
purse searchers and uniformed police officers scattered throughout the
Anaheim resort area.</LD>
<LD>   At the inaugural New Year's Eve festivities for Disney's California
Adventure, some guests had a beer or a bit of bubbly.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't want to see any stumbling drunks running around Disneyland,
but as long as people keep their cool, it's fine," Nick Fernando, 21, of
Torrance said as he sipped an $8 glass of champagne at the Golden Vine
Winery in California Adventure.</LD>
<TE>   Deron McCoy, 29, of Hermosa Beach said he and his friends had visited
the theme park so they could have a couple of beers with dinner. "We got
some tickets at the 11th hour," he said. "We decided to come to
Disneyland because everything in the L.A. area was pretty calm. We
thought this would be something different."</TE>
<TE>   It did seem festive as park officials handed out party hats and
noisemakers that sounded like quacking ducks. Countdowns to midnight were
planned at several locations in both Disney parks.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Nachum, a spokeswoman for Disneyland Resort, said New Year's
Eve "is the busiest time of year for us. It's a well-known fact."</TE>
<TE>   Though Disney does not release attendance figures, one supervisor said
projections were the same as for 2000: about 65,000 at the Magic Kingdom,
with 15,000 more arriving after midnight from California Adventure. The
holiday is Disneyland's latest night of the year, closing at 3 a.m., with
California Adventure closing at 1 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody was turned away from either park this year, officials said.
Ticket sales were halted three times between Christmas and New Year's in
2000 because of heavy crowds, but that did not happen in 2001, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   All three of the resort's hotels were sold out for the night, however,
and other large hotels in Anaheim also were full, including the
1,572-room Anaheim Hilton and Towers and the 489-room Sheraton Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it would be quieter, to tell you the truth," said Al Lutz,
editor of the Web site MousePlanet.com, which is devoted to unofficial
Disney news and advice. He said Disney parks in Florida seem to have been
hurt more by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "For some reason, we've been really unaffected out here," Lutz said.
"I think they've been doing great. Disneyland, in particular, has been
well exceeding its numbers."</TE>
<TE>   Disney officials said security has been heightened since the terrorist
attacks, and guests are being asked to open their purses and backpacks
for searches. "It doesn't bother me," said Erica Sotelo, 20, of Los
Angeles. "It's for safety. It takes up a little time, makes the lines
longer, but that's it. I love Disneyland."</TE>
<TE>   The only other reminders of the tragedy were American flag decorations
and the red, white and blue merchandise that has popped up at stores
throughout the resort area.</TE>
<TE>   Crowds were heavy Monday, with 90-minute waits for popular Disneyland
attractions such as the Indiana Jones Adventure and Space Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   Both Disney parks had plenty of holiday trimmings: Christmas lights
and decorations, the "Believe . . . In Holiday Magic" fireworks and snow
show, special entertainment at California Adventure, and rides such as
the Haunted Mansion and It's a Small World made over for the season.</TE>
<TE>   Even Disneyland's trademark "Happiest Place on Earth" motto was
altered ever so slightly on concession area napkins and cups to read "The
Merriest Place on Earth."</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in Orange County, Fullerton's historic downtown area held
its 11th annual "First Night Fullerton," an alcohol-free event featuring
live entertainment, children's activities and a fireworks finale.</TE>

<HD>Ventura County Supervisors Face Tough Year</HD>
<DH>Government: Budget and labor woes are among challenges in 2002. Two
seats are up for election.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced with falling revenues, a big hole in the budget and tense
labor negotiations, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors is
confronting a year of tough choices in 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Sticker shock arrives in mid-January, when Gov. Gray Davis is expected
to announce reduced funding for counties to help close an anticipated
$12.4-billion shortfall in the state's 2002-03 budget.</LD>
<LD>   That will set the tone for the next six months as supervisors scramble
to keep local government running on fewer dollars, officials predict.</LD>
<TE>   Budget analysts already are projecting a $20-million shortfall in
county government's $1.1-billion budget for the coming year, a figure
that does not include any further reductions from the state.</TE>
<TE>   Financial pressures will probably force the Board of Supervisors to
trim the county's 7,200-member work force and possibly reduce services to
make ends meet, several supervisors said.</TE>
<TE>   "So much of our budget relies on those pass-through funds from the
state," Supervisor Kathy Long said. "It's going to be a Scrooge of a year
any way you look at it."</TE>
<TE>   Though budget decisions will dominate, board members will face other
thorny issues in 2002. They include:</TE>
<TE>   * Contract negotiations with the union representing sheriff's
deputies. Talks have dragged on for a year, with each side accusing the
other of distorting facts and fanning rancor. With no settlement in
sight, deputies are vowing to ratchet up the pressure on supervisors in
2002.</TE>
<TE>   * Creation of a land preservation district. Sixty-eight percent of
Ventura County voters said they wanted one in 1998. But supervisors are
split on whether they will support the state legislation needed to get
the ball rolling.</TE>
<TE>   * Anti-terrorism preparation. County leaders will continue beefing up
safeguards against terrorist attacks, improving coordination with health
officials, emergency workers and law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   * Review of supplemental environmental studies for the proposed
Ahmanson Ranch development. Stopping the 3,050-home development at the
county's southeastern fringe has become a rallying cry for a vocal group
of opponents in Thousand Oaks and Los Angeles County. The issue will
again be closely watched in the year ahead.</TE>
<TE>   * Mental health housing and services. Supervisors will debate whether
to add a limited amount of affordable housing for mentally ill residents
on county-owned property near Camarillo. Some mental health advocates are
pushing for a more expansive project that includes a variety of nonprofit
housing and services.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the March primary will produce at least one new board member.</TE>
<TE>   Since there are only two candidates in each of the two supervisorial
contests, the primary will decide both seats.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Frank Schillo will depart his Thousand Oaks-based district
in December 2002, setting the stage for what is expected to be a costly
battle to replace him. Two candidates, Thousand Oaks City Councilwoman
Linda Parks and businessman Randy Hoffman, are facing off on the March 5
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Judy Mikels, meanwhile, has one challenger, Moorpark fraud
investigator John Lane.</TE>
<TE>   Though winners won't be seated until January 2003, the election's
outcome will signal which way the board is likely to tilt on everything
from union demands to growth policy.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly everyone at the Hall of Administration agrees that budget
problems will consume much of the supervisors' time in the coming year.</TE>
<TE>   A recession-spawned slowdown in sales taxes and other funding sources
is expected to hit with full force by mid-June, County Executive Officer
Johnny Johnston warned.</TE>
<TE>   That means budget cutters will be looking to squeeze out every dollar
they can, including revenue flowing to the county's public safety
departments, Johnston said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year the board did not exercise its option of cutting the
cost-of-living allowance given to the sheriff, district attorney, public
defender and probation chief. Those departments received a 9% increase in
general fund dollars, Johnston said.</TE>
<TE>   But the new fiscal reality suggests that the board may approve little
more than a standard 3% inflationary adjustment, the county chief said.</TE>
<TE>   That could be a tough wake-up call for law enforcement, which has
become accustomed to hefty voter-approved increases in the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   "This year [Sheriff Bob] Brooks got less money than he said he needed,
about $4.5 million less," Johnston said. "It will be even tougher next
year."</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations with the union representing county sheriff's deputies and
district attorney investigators are also expected to be fraught with
tension.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies are pushing for an enhanced pension benefit that Johnston
says will cost the county's retirement system $100 million. Union leaders
say the real cost is closer to $80 million.</TE>
<TE>   The union accuses Johnston and the supervisors of trying to paint them
as greedy for asking for something that is quickly becoming standard for
law enforcement across California.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute has dragged on for a year and got so heated in late 2001
that deputies threatened to stage an illegal strike.</TE>
<TE>   Though they backed away from that, leaders of the Ventura County
Deputy Sheriffs' Assn. have vowed to pursue legal options to resolve
contract issues.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, association chief Glen Kitzmann has said members will
work tirelessly to elect union-backed candidates in the March primary.
Hoffman and Lane have both been endorsed by the deputies' union.</TE>

<DL>LOS ALTOS HILLS, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>Although it is home to much of Silicon Valley's high-tech ruling
class, this rolling, horse-dotted community on the outskirts of Palo Alto
decided in the mournful aftermath of Sept. 11 that it has a modern-day
communications problem.</LD>
<LD>   When the mayor wanted to notify her community of a town vigil to
answer the president's call for a national day of prayer, she didn't have
a way to get the word out quickly. Civic groups provided e-mail addresses
for more than 1,000 households, but most of the exclusive hamlet's 8,000
people were left out of the loop.</LD>
<LD>   Los Altos Hills has no newspaper to call its own, and no downtown to
speak of either. Many homes are separated by acres of sprawling
countryside and ensconced behind protective gates. The two sheriffs are
on assignment from the county.</LD>
<TE>   Mayor Toni Casey wondered what would happen if one day lives were
threatened. How could the town, with a staff of 21, warn people that they
were in danger?</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the community has tapped its resources, both high-tech and
low, to bring itself up to speed with its Information Age surroundings.
Town officials sent postcards to every household asking for e-mail
addresses and fax and phone numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders say they have lobbied aggressively to encourage local phone
company PacBell to make high-speed Internet access available to all
residents, and hustled to remove red tape. And a small group of ham radio
enthusiasts dusted off the town's abandoned shortwave equipment and
cobbled together a network for future emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   "With the type of creativity and high-tech capabilities we have in Los
Altos Hills, we certainly ought to have this available to our residents,"
Casey said.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor rattles off half a dozen or so of the high-tech chief
executives that she counts among her constituents, including John
Chambers of Cisco Systems Inc. and James C. Morgan of Applied Materials
Inc. Wilfred J. Corrigan, chief executive of LSI Logic Corp., serves on
the town's finance committee.</TE>
<TE>   Responses to the e-mail and phone requests have been short of
overwhelming, City Manager Maureen Cassingham said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like everybody would be sitting in front of their computers
in an emergency, but this is just one more way we can try to stay in
touch," she said. "Almost everything is on the table these days, from a
physical disaster to a terrorist attack."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, as past emergencies have shown, the high-tech communications
network the city is working so hard to build might be better suited to a
chicken pox epidemic than a terrorist attack or a catastrophic
earthquake. Fax machines and computers require electricity and working
telephone systems, which are easily overwhelmed in times of crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to say it's a bad idea" to collect phone numbers and
e-mail addresses, said Los Altos Hills retiree Scott Overstreet, chairman
of the town's emergency communications committee. "But it turns out that
even for a fairly small town, there isn't enough capacity in a typical
switching system to sustain an effort to reach everyone at once. It just
doesn't make too much sense."</TE>
<TE>   That's why Overstreet, a former aerospace electronics engineer, and a
handful of other ham radio buffs have moved to resurrect the town's
shortwave network.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to build a small group of dedicated operators around the
equipment, and then bring in those who are somewhat interested to be
available if something really big should happen," he said. "If we could
expect them to come on the radio in an emergency, we might have an eyes
and ears system throughout the town."</TE>
<TE>   Although enthusiasm for ham radio has dampened somewhat in the wake of
the Internet and other new communications tools, it remains a popular
passion among tech types of a certain age in Silicon Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "We probably have a larger percentage of ham radio licenses in our
town than most around here," said Overstreet, a resident since 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Los Altos Hills is not alone in tapping old technology to prepare for
new dangers. Lots of ham radio operators returned to their transmitters
in the wake of Sept. 11, said Bill Walters of San Jose, president of the
Santa Clara Valley Repeaters Society, an amateur radio club with about 50
members.</TE>
<TE>   Walters also recalled the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, when tens of
thousands of residents were without power for days. Walters, a programmer
at IBM, was one of hundreds of employees who loaded their radio gear into
rented trucks and drove door to door through the Santa Cruz mountains,
checking on their co-workers and delivering relief supplies from the
company.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent they have e-mail and cell phones, people will use them
to communicate," Walters said. "If they're not available, people will use
what they have, and sometimes what they have is amateur radio."</TE>

<HD>Monterey Bay to Get Visitor Center</HD>
<DH>Funding: Bill signed by Bush provides money for a facility to serve
the marine sanctuary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONTEREY, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>With thick kelp forests and exotic wildlife, Monterey Bay has been
described more than once as an underwater Yosemite. Now, the ocean
expanse will get one of the true trappings of a national park, a visitor
center.</LD>
<LD>   Fulfilling a decade-long dream of former Congressman Leon Panetta and
other bay supporters, the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary won
preliminary funding from Congress in December.</LD>
<LD>   The funding came Nov. 28, when President Bush signed the Commerce
Department budget bill, which includes $1.25 million for planning and
other work on the project.</LD>
<TE>   Next month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration plans
to award a contract for a feasibility study. Construction could start in
2003.</TE>
<TE>   "This is great," said Panetta, now chairman of the Pew Oceans
Commission, a nonprofit group studying ocean issues nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with the ocean is that we tend to take it for granted. In
Monterey Bay, you've got a canyon that is twice as deep as the Grand
Canyon, for example. So few people really know about the sea life there.
A center like this will give us a chance to see what lies beneath."</TE>
<TE>   As a congressman representing Monterey and Santa Cruz, Panetta blocked
efforts by the Reagan administration to allow oil drilling off Big Sur
and San Mateo County. He wrote the bill that established the sanctuary
along 276 miles of coastline from the Marin Headlands to San Simeon,
banning oil drilling forever in the area. The bill was signed into law in
1992.</TE>
<TE>   During that era, Panetta repeatedly said he hoped the public would
have a place similar to a national park visitor center to learn about the
marine environment, Central Coast history and the extensive underwater
research in Monterey Bay.</TE>
<TE>   A location has not yet been chosen, said William Douros,
superintendent of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary,
headquartered in Monterey.</TE>
<TE>   But Douros said the three leading sites so far are Santa Cruz,
Monterey and Aptos.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll want to describe what a marine sanctuary is, why it is there,
what is out there and what people can do to protect it," Douros said.</TE>
<TE>   Plans call for exhibits on wildlife and history, along with
information on where people can fish, boat and enjoy other activities.</TE>

<LD>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.'s bankruptcy could jeopardize a
class-action suit by 1,200 people who allege they were exposed to
contaminated water at the utility's Kettleman Hills facility.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for both sides are scheduled to appear Thursday in a San
Francisco bankruptcy court to argue over whether the case will be heard
by a state or federal court and whether the bankruptcy will limit a
judgment or settlement.</LD>
<LD>   The suit alleges that the plaintiffs, most of whom had some connection
to the utility's Kettleman Compressor Station in western Kings County,
were exposed to water contaminated with chromium 6 through a well. They
are suing the utility for $500 million.</LD>

<HD>Review Set for Sierra Use Plan</HD>
<DH>Environment: Forestry official's letter keeps alive the debate over
millions of acres of federal forest land.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal forestry official signaled Monday that he is open to
significant reshaping of a plan that slashes timber harvests and
strengthens wildlife protections on national forest land in the Sierra
Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter released by his office, Pacific Southwest Regional
Forester Jack Blackwell said that over the next year, he will undertake a
broad review of the Sierra blueprint to gauge its impact on grazing,
recreation, local communities and wildfire threats.</LD>
<LD>   His statement promises to keep alive a long and contentious debate
over management of 11 1/2 million acres of federal forest up and down the
Sierra Nevada.</LD>
<TE>   Just last week, the Bush administration upheld the much-appealed plan,
adopted in the final days of the Clinton presidency after years of study
and revision.</TE>
<TE>   But in affirming the guidelines, Agriculture Undersecretary Mark Rey
also gave the regional forester room to modify them.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter to Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth and in
accompanying documents, Blackwell said he is assembling a team to review
the plan, "evaluate any needed changes . . . and, if necessary, propose
them."</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists immediately charged that Blackwell is intent on
undermining the new protections, which timber and recreational interests
have criticized as far too restrictive.</TE>
<TE>   "This is clearly catering to the timber industry," said Chad Hanson,
executive direct of the John Muir Project.</TE>
<TE>   Blackwell singled out several areas for reexamination. One is greater
reduction of forest growth that fuels fires. Another is the impact of the
new guidelines on ski areas, cabins and other recreation uses.</TE>
<TE>   He also indicated he will move ahead with a pilot project in part of
the range that is less restrictive than the overall management plan;
attempt to maintain livestock grazing near existing levels; and
reconsider some restrictions dealing with wildlife sites and old-growth
trees.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the Sierra guidelines said they were encouraged by
Blackwell's position, if unsure where it would lead.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a wait-and-see attitude," said Don Amador of the BlueRibbon
Coalition, a recreation group. "But certainly this letter today is a step
in the right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the Regional Council of Rural Counties said they were
heartened by Blackwell's letter.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups that last week praised the Bush administration
for letting the Sierra guidelines stand were uniformly dismayed by
Blackwell's letter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very alarming," said Craig Thomas of the Sierra Nevada Forest
Protection Campaign. "It looks like they want to basically take apart all
this work that has been going on for nine years."</TE>
<TE>   Wilderness Society regional director Jay Watson said the scope of
Blackwell's review "begs the question of whether Jack Blackwell was sent
here to destroy this plan. This seems like a bomb has been dropped on the
framework."</TE>
<TE>   Forest Service spokesman Matt Mathes said Blackwell is trying to
address issues raised in appeals.</TE>
<TE>   "We are sensitive to concerns expressed by members of the public,"
Mathes said. "These are public lands."</TE>

<HD>Clinton McKinnon, 95; Publisher, Congressman</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clinton Dotson McKinnon, a newspaper publisher who served in
Congress half a century ago when he was the last representative for all
of San Diego County, has died. He was 95.</LD>
<LD>   McKinnon, who served from 1948 to 1952 before redistricting gave the
county two seats in Congress, died Saturday in La Jolla of causes
associated with age.</LD>
<LD>   The two-term Democratic congressman ingratiated himself to
constituents by fighting for water rights, not only in San Diego but
throughout the Southwest, and helping to bring Colorado River water to
the county.</LD>
<TE>   He also intervened to help solve a dispute between the federal
government and farmers in the Fallbrook area over water from the Santa
Margarita River. Farmers claimed federal authorities were ruining them by
diverting water needed for irrigation to military facilities at Camp
Pendleton. McKinnon helped speed construction of a dam to ease the
standoff.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1950s, he also moved to increase tariffs on imported
canned tuna from Japan and South America in a futile attempt to preserve
the tuna cannery business in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   In 1952, McKinnon attempted to move up to the U.S. Senate by
challenging incumbent Republican Sen. William Knowland. But the Democrat
was not well-known statewide and got trounced in the landslide for
Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower. "That was not a good year,"
McKinnon quipped years later, "to be a Democrat."</TE>
<TE>   He went back to his regular profession--running small newspapers. Not
that he had left all thoughts of it behind during his four years in
Washington. He once told the National Production Authority, an economic
body, it ought to get "a good newspaper rewrite man" to interpret its
overly complex regulations of small businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "The businessman is having a difficult time making heads or tails of
those orders," McKinnon told the group. He said the regulations should at
least be accompanied by a summary written "by a man who writes what
people can read and understand."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Dallas, McKinnon was raised by his mother, a nurse, after his
father died when he was 12. He grew up to own and run several newspapers
in Texas and California.</TE>
<TE>   After publishing community newspapers in North Hollywood, he settled
in San Diego and on March 17, 1944, became the only person to start a
daily newspaper during World War II. That was the San Diego Journal,
which was later absorbed by the San Diego Union-Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   Hard-working and personable, McKinnon was a hands-on publisher who
knew his staff and their children's names. He employed several future
leaders, including current Union-Tribune associate editor and senior
columnist Neil Morgan and Lionel Van Deerlin, who later served 18 years
in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Van Deerlin told the Union-Tribune that McKinnon waged a difficult
uphill battle against his larger competitors from 1944 until 1948. "He
would offer six silver knives for a six-month subscription to the
Journal," Van Deerlin said, "and the Tribune would counter by offering a
weekend in Catalina."</TE>
<TE>   McKinnon seemingly became a mentor to future politicians--not only Van
Deerlin, but both of his own sons. Mike McKinnon, who now owns two Texas
newspapers and is managing co-owner of KUSI-TV in San Diego and co-owner
of San Diego Home-Garden Magazine, served one term in the Texas Senate.
Clinton Dan McKinnon, a conservative Republican in contrast to his
liberal Democrat dad, ran unsuccessfully for Congress, then was named by
President Ronald Reagan as head of the Civil Aviation Board.</TE>
<TE>   Among other newspapers owned by McKinnon at different times were the
La Jolla Light and the Coronado Journal. He also founded radio station
KCBQ, originally under the call letters KSDJ.</TE>
<TE>   McKinnon is survived by his wife, Lucille; two sons; a daughter,
Connie McKinnon of New York; and seven grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Services are planned for 10 a.m. Wednesday at Pacific Beach
Presbyterian Church, 1675 Garnet Ave. The family has asked that any
memorial donations be sent to the Midway Baptist Church Youth Program.</TE>

<HD>Cassia Eller, 39; Brazilian Rock Singer Known for Brash Style</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cassia Eller, 39, the Brazilian rock singer known for her
provocative behavior on stage, died Saturday in Rio de Janeiro after she
was hospitalized in an "agitated and disoriented" state from what one
hospital spokesman called "intoxication." Eller had said she used
cocaine. An autopsy will be performed.</LD>
<LD>   Eller's fame peaked this year with the sale of about 250,000 copies of
her "MTV Unplugged" album and a performance in January's Rock in Rio
festival. She sang one of her hits, with the typical lyrics, "I just ask
God for a little indecency." She was personally chosen by the Rolling
Stones to open for them in Rio on their Bridges to Babylon tour in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Shunning middle-class Brazilian morals, Eller openly discussed her
13-year relationship with another woman, wore punk haircuts and bared her
breasts during a televised performance.</LD>
<TE>   "There is no such thing as right or wrong," she said in a recent
interview. "You choose what's good for you, and it ends up working out
well."</TE>

<HD>Harshad Mehta, 51; Broker Caught Up in India Market Scandal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harshad Mehta, 51, a stockbroker who led millions of investors into
India's biggest market crash 10 years ago, died Sunday of a heart attack
while in police custody in Bombay.</LD>
<LD>   Known as "Big Bull" on Bombay's Wall Street equivalent, Dalal Street,
Mehta once owned 19 trendy apartments and a fleet of Rolls-Royce
automobiles. But he was charged by a parliamentary committee with
defrauding local and foreign banks in 1992 by illegally using their funds
to drive up stock prices. The benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensex
doubled between January and April of that year, only to lose all its
gains in the next seven months.</LD>
<LD>   At one point, Mehta tried to bring down the Indian government,
accusing then-Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao of accepting a bribe from
him. Mehta was stripped of his broker's license and banned from
securities trading for life.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, police arrested him for illegally selling shares that were
part of the evidence in the 1992 scandal. India's Central Bureau of
Investigation accused Mehta and his two brothers of selling as many as
2.7 million shares of 90 companies that did not belong to them.</TE>

<LD>Billy Wells, 70, star of the 1954 Rose Bowl for Michigan State and
later an NFL player, died Christmas Day at his Altadena home of
undisclosed causes.</LD>
<LD>   Wells, a halfback for Clarence "Biggie" Munn's Michigan State team,
scored two touchdowns--one a 62-yard punt return in the fourth
quarter--in the Spartans' 28-20 victory over UCLA in the Rose Bowl 38
years ago. Michigan State had rallied from a 14-0 deficit before a crowd
of 101,100.</LD>
<LD>   "Biggie Munn was like a father to him," said Wells' longtime friend
Palmer Casey. "After the punt return, as he was running to the bench, he
said, 'That was for you, Biggie.' "</LD>
<TE>   Wells joined the NFL in 1954 and played for Washington, Pittsburgh and
Philadelphia. His last year was in 1960 with the Patriots of the AFL.</TE>
<TE>   In 1961, Wells and Casey founded Billy and His Bachelors, a Dixieland
band. Casey said the band performed at social functions in Southern
California, with Wells singing and playing banjo.</TE>

<HD>William Dougherty, 77; Ex-Marine, Attorney for 'Falcon' in Spy Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HICKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William A. Dougherty, a Villa Park attorney who gained public
attention for his defense of Christopher Boyce, the "Falcon" of the spy
duo immortalized in the book and film "The Falcon and the Snowman," has
died. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   Dougherty, who was known as a lively curmudgeon in Orange County
Republican political circles, died Wednesday at his home in the upscale
community east of Anaheim. He had prostate cancer and fell into a coma on
Christmas Day.</LD>
<LD>   A specialist in federal court cases, Dougherty took on Boyce's defense
in the 1970s. Boyce was one of two young men from well-to-do Palos Verdes
Peninsula families convicted of selling government secrets to the Soviet
Union through its embassy in Mexico City.</LD>
<TE>   Boyce had obtained the information through his high-security job at
TRW, which had numerous top-secret government contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the nicest young men you'd ever meet," Dougherty said of
Boyce, who got the nickname "the Falcon" because of his love of falconry.
Boyce was portrayed in the 1985 motion picture by actor Timothy Hutton.</TE>
<TE>   Dougherty also became known around California in the 1970s for trying
to move the Republican Party in Orange County away from the dominant
conservatism represented by such politicians as former congressmen Robert
K. Dornan and John Schmitz. Though he never was successful in winning
political office himself, Dougherty was considered a leader among the
moderate or liberal wing of the local GOP.</TE>
<TE>   "I always called myself a Dougherty Republican," said local defense
attorney H. Dean Steward, a longtime ally of Dougherty's within the
party. "There weren't that many of us, but we were dedicated to moving
the party back where it should be."</TE>
<TE>   Dougherty angered many fellow Republicans in 1996 when he supported
Democrat Loretta Sanchez after she successfully defeated Dornan. In her
literature, Dougherty called Dornan a "war wimp." It cost Dougherty his
seat on the county's Republican Central Committee, but after he filed a
lawsuit against the party, he eventually was reinstated.</TE>
<TE>   A highly decorated Marine fighter pilot during World War II, the
Korean War and the Vietnam War, Dougherty retired as a reserve colonel in
1976. He founded the November 10th Assn., a local group of ex-Marines
that holds an annual dinner to honor the corps' inception, and was active
in the Marine Foundation, a fund-raising group.</TE>
<TE>   Dougherty also helped out each year with the "Devil Pups," a two-week
training session at Camp Pendleton for high school students interested in
becoming Marines.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the Marine's Marine," said Superior Court Judge William M.
Monroe, a longtime friend who once served under Dougherty's command in
the reserves. "There wasn't anything Bill wouldn't do to promote the
Marine Corps."</TE>
<TE>   In November, Dougherty wore his formal Marine uniform to the annual
November 10th Assn. dinner, joking that he never could have fit into it
had he not lost so much weight in his fight against cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Dougherty received his law degree from Cornell University in New York
in 1955. He served as an assistant U.S. attorney for three years, and
later worked for U.S. Sen. Kenneth Keating of New York.</TE>
<TE>   Dougherty is survived by his wife, Sharlee; two daughters, Robyn and
Shannon; and a son, William.</TE>
<TE>   He requested no funeral service or memorial. The family suggests
donations to the William A. Dougherty Scholarship Fund at Kents Hill
School in Maine. The address is P.O. Box 257, Route 17, Kents Hill, ME
04349-0257.</TE>

<HD>Lawrence Singleton, 74; Rapist Cut Off Teenage Girl's Arms</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Lawrence Singleton, who chopped off a teenage hitchhiker's forearms
in California and was later sent to death row in Florida for killing a
prostitute, has died of cancer behind bars. He was 74.</LD>
<LD>   Singleton died Friday at the North Florida Reception Center in Starke.
He had been on death row since 1998, but no execution date had been set.</LD>
<LD>   In 1978, Singleton raped 15-year-old Mary Vincent, cut off her
forearms and left her naked in a ditch near Modesto to die. In a decision
that caused a furor in California, he was paroled in 1987 after serving
eight years of a 14-year term.</LD>
<TE>   Outraged California communities refused to accept him, and authorities
ended up housing him in a mobile home at San Quentin State Prison until
his parole was up in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Singleton eventually moved to Tampa, where he had spent his childhood.
Residents protested and a car dealer offered him $5,000 to leave the
state. A homemade bomb was detonated near the Singleton home, but nobody
was injured.</TE>
<TE>   A jury in Florida convicted Singleton of murder for stabbing to death
Roxanne Hayes, 31, at his Tampa home in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent testified during Singleton's penalty hearing in Florida,
pointing him out with an artificial limb.</TE>
<TE>   The retired merchant marine seaman denied raping and mutilating
Vincent, but admitted stabbing Hayes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry about the death in this case," he told the judge as he was
sentenced to die. "I'll have to carry it on my conscience the rest of my
life."</TE>
