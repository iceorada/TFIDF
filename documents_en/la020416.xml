<LD>Afghan rugs and velvet-covered couches have transformed the crowded
parking lot behind Sunset Boulevard into a hippie-inspired love den.</LD>
<LD>   It's Fashion Week in Los Angeles, and the guests at tonight's
soiree have dressed accordingly: a slim man in tightfitting
multicolored striped pants, a petite woman nearly consumed by her
white ankle-length fur jacket and others in faux snakeskin, suede and
"deconstructed" garments that have been taken apart and creatively
pieced back together.</LD>
<LD>   Everyone hovers near Lorenzo Hadar and his wife, Sharona, the
evening's hosts. It's Thursday night, and the Los Angeles boutique
owners (known for their nearby stores H. Lorenzo for women and H.
Shoes) are hosting a cocktail party to celebrate their newest store
in the tony Sunset Plaza shopping area: H. Men's.</LD>
<TE>   Guests move between the parking lot and the store, where H. Men's
general manager, Marcus Laxamana, a tall man in white leather, is
giving a tour of the place.</TE>
<TE>   The store, a modestly sized space with extremely high ceilings,
was designed by Italian architect Oliviero Baldini. Everything--the
cash registers, the green velvet chairs, the wooden benches, the
industrial hooks, the stone sculptures--has been shipped from Italy.
In a loft upstairs, shirts and pants hang on industrial hooks
illuminated from above, as in a museum exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   "We showcase our collection as forms of art," says Laxamana,
though unlike a museum, "the whole feeling [here] is not to be
intimidated about picking this up and touching it."</TE>
<TE>   The real attractions are three glass rooms at the rear of the
store disguised by giant pictures of nude men bearing swords and
wearing armored helmets. These are the dressing rooms. When a
customer approaches, the picture slides away, and the glass fogs
instantly. To demonstrate, Laxamana stands inside the room. One
moment he's waving. The next he has disappeared behind steamed glass.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, downstairs, Lorenzo greets guests with a kiss and a
compliment. A man walks by in a burgundy Moroccan outfit (a long
dress-like covering with loose fitting pants) topped by a burgundy
velvet derby. "A lot of skirts in here," Lorenzo quips, toward the
man. The man smiles and moves on.</TE>
<TE>   Lorenzo wears a classic L.A. look--jeans, a black leather shirt
and a beaded necklace and a wrist full of leather bracelets. Lorenzo
is relaxed and friendly. There is no need to pitch.</TE>
<TE>   For 19 years, Hadar has established himself with a celebrity
clientele. He brings select European designs to L.A. and then sells
them to the rich and famous. "I put, I think, more imagination into
[selecting] clothes," he says. "And that's my secret."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile,</TE>
<TE>   to the East ...</TE>
<TE>   As guests balanced glasses of wine and browsed through vintage and
designer clothes behind him, stylist Daniel Caudill (casual, in
T-shirt and Helmut Lang jeans) gave his take on which pages in the
Thomas Guide map book are the most fashionable.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody from the West wants to go East," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With their new store "Eastside," Caudill and fashion designer
Estevan Ramos (in a beige vintage Givenchy suit) are hoping to
capitalize on the area's popularity and to create a Silver Lake
counterpart to Fred Segal.</TE>
<TE>   As invitations for the Thursday night opening, the two had sent
out paper napkins with the time and date scrawled on them. About 50
people took the cue and came to view their collection of vintage and
designer clothes, antiques, bric-a-brac, classic and contemporary art
displayed in a former office space on Santa Monica Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   In the crowd were friends and colleagues, including actress Eliza
Dushku, designers Magda Berliner, Eduardo Lucero, Monah Li and Trina
Turk, photographer Jonathan Skow and stylist Vincent Boucher.</TE>
<TE>   There were no geographic divides as Caudill surveyed the room.
"That's what I like about L.A.," he said. "Everybody's always rooting
for each other."</TE>

that bridge, and I'm not going to get a release until I jump."</TE>

<HD>Media Mogul and a New Sun Rise in N.Y.</HD>
<DH>After months of buzz, a daily broadsheet is launched with
backing from Conrad Black.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAUREN SANDLER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This morning, in the predawn hours, millions of pages were sorted,
tied, trucked and heaved to the pavement beside thousands of
newsstands and apartments buildings in New York City. There was the
usual trio of papers that divide the city demographically: the
tabs--the Daily News and New York Post--that litter the subways by 9,
and the broadsheet New York Times that doormen deposit along rows of
high-rise corridors. But this morning, for the first time in years,
there is a new addition, a second broadsheet, stacked at newsstands
alongside the long-standing rivals. Today, the New York Sun debuts
after months of buzz in media columns in its own city and around the
world, which have speculated not only about the paper itself, but
also about one of its backers, a controversial Canadian media mogul
named Lord Conrad Black.</LD>
<LD>   Some might say the Sun is part debut, part resurrection. The Sun
was New York's first penny paper and published from 1833 through its
demise in 1950. It's mentioned in passing most Decembers, when
nostalgic editors trot out its most famous column--an 1897 letter to
the editor from a girl named Virginia who wanted to know if there was
in fact a Santa Claus.</LD>
<TE>   Today's Sun has many Santas--a board of magnate mega-millionaires
who pay the rent on the lofty modern newsroom a block from where the
Sun originally rose. The old Sun offered a view of City Hall over the
clatter of carts and the bustle of barristers. The new one overlooks
a comestibles establishment called Popeye's Chicken and Biscuits and
a haberdashery shop called Hip-Hip Fashion.</TE>
<TE>   But nostalgia reigns at the Sun, where editor Seth Lipsky hovers
like the kind of wire-rimmed, suited man Dickens would have created
had he written a novel about the news racket. Lipsky, a former Wall
Street Journal star (he launched the Asian edition) and
editor-in-chief of the Jewish daily the Forward, envisions the Sun as
a New York-centric, big-business-wooing outlet for the conservative
sensibilities he has said go unexpressed and unsatisfied in the
city's dominant broadsheet.</TE>
<TE>   The paper's regular roster of contributors is a veritable who's
who of free market-hailing, big government-damning writers, including
Reagan biographer Peggy Noonan and columnist R. Emmett Tyrell Jr.,
one of the founders of the right-wing American Spectator. In what
some would say is ripe irony, their writing will run under the
original Sun motto, "It Shines for All," which spoke to the original
paper's cheerleading for labor unions, immigration and the rights of
its predominantly working-class readership.</TE>
<TE>   Lipsky's views and ambitions are matched by those of the backer he
calls a "classical news baron"--Lord Black, whose involvement has
received more column space in papers around the world than the 20
pages that make up the New York Sun. Black's media empire is the
third-largest worldwide--after Rupert Murdoch's and Gannett's--and
stretches from the American Midwest to Canada, England and Israel.
But with all that international capital, it's his involvement within
the Sun--$2 million bought him a 12% stake--that gives him his first
toehold in the media capital of the world.</TE>
<TE>   It's rare that one rich man's relatively small investment has
attracted such attention. But Black's move is a long-expected one,
gained after years of vain attempts to buy a variety of New York
publications, including the weekly Observer and the Daily News.</TE>
<TE>   And it's Black custom to cultivate gossip and speculation as
readily as he does newspapers. He is famous for buying up entire
regions of dailies--until recently he owned every newspaper in three
Canadian provinces--to fund his empire, and then sinking massive
amounts of his stockholders' money into papers that showcase his own
political views.</TE>
<TE>   This has led many critics to categorize his holdings as either
business projects or money pits stamped with his neoconservative
agenda, which includes his unabashed support of corporate interest
and his vitriolic disdain for government regulation, welfare and what
he has described as the "featherbedding greed" of organized labor.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no path to New York media domination through being one of
the people at the New York Sun," says media critic and Black
biographer Richard Siklos. "But it is an interesting and admirable
addition to the New York media scene. "People are intrigued by the
paper, and by Black, by the idea ideas of a Victorian Fleet Street
press baron type in the era of USA Today and 24-hour news channels."</TE>
<TE>   Black's company has issued a press release "clarifying" that
Black's role in the Sun would be a "passive and minority" one. But
Lipsky says Black will certainly play a role in the development of
the paper, both ideologically and journalistically. Their politics
are aligned, he says--"that's why I wooed him"--and adds that what
"Conrad says is listened to with exceptional attentiveness because he
knows so much about newspapers."</TE>
<TE>   "He looks at a paper as a paper, not as a balance sheet," says
Canadian essayist Robert Fulford, who was the editor of the
now-defunct Toronto-based magazine Saturday Night when Black bought
it in 1987. "He knows how to make good newspapers, and he's very
proud of that."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Black, nor anyone in his inner circle, was willing to be
interviewed for this article. But just about anyone else in Canadian
or New York media criticism has something to say--on or off the
record--about Black.</TE>
<TE>   Black, the 58-year-old son of a Canadian brewer, began his
newspaper career writing editorials for small papers, the likes of
which he quickly began buying up with his family fortune while still
in his 20s. Black parlayed those papers into the media empire he
named Hollinger. Today, it includes the Chicago Sun-Times and a
handful of smaller stateside papers, the Jerusalem Post, London's
Daily Telegraph (the central diamond in his crown), and Canadian
titles that he buys and sells with such alacrity that not even his
own New York-based assistant can tell you within a ballpark figure
how many publications he owns on a given day.</TE>
<TE>   He oversees those properties from his many estates, one of which
he calls Havenwold, where the coat of arms he commissioned hangs
above the entrance.</TE>
<TE>   Fulford recalls experiencing an eerie deja vu upon meeting the man
he calls Citizen Black. "As I was talking to him, he was joking,
facetious, wordy and grand. And I thought I had met him before,
talked to him before. But actually I hadn't--I was thinking of Orson
Welles as Citizen Kane," he says.</TE>
<TE>   It's his Kane-like contrast of puffed-up swagger and cerebral
polish that secures his mystique. He's a man of "extraordinary
substance and historical knowledge," says Lipsky, who notes that
Black traffics in the tweedy sort of intellectualism some people say
was ushered out with the World Wars that so fascinate him. Black has
written a scholarly book about Quebecois politician Maurice
Duplessis, and fluently and frequently drops references to Roosevelt
and King George into quotidian conversation.</TE>
<TE>   But dropping names of dead historical figures has never been
enough for Black--it's his hobnobbing with living ones that has
defined his social persona. For years he's been a fixture on London's
dinner party circuit, where the calligraphied place cards feature
such names as Margaret Thatcher. Fulford recalls listening to Black
list acquaintances Katharine Graham, the Aga Khan, Henry Kissinger
and Thatcher in a single conversation. "I remember he leaned back
satisfied as he dropped each name," Fulford says. "It occurred to me
that I might never witness this feat equaled in my lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   Black has always wanted to be regarded as more than a mere party
presence, not just moving with the movers and shakers but shaking
with them as well. In 1998, he tired of simply owning papers and
decided to invent one to give himself a significant arena for debate
and influence in Canada. He launched what he envisioned to be the
national paper of Canada: The National Post.</TE>
<TE>   His two goals for the venture were to have a successful
neoconservative paper and to unite the Canadian right. In the end,
the Post launched its own political party, the Canadian Alliance,
headed up by the newspaper's top brass, and Black's company
hemorrhaged money until he shocked Canada by selling off his baby
last year, losing $300 million in the process. Naomi Klein, a
left-wing columnist for the Globe and Mail, says the irony of the
Post's failure is that it collapses the market model that defines
Black's politics. "It's funny--he obviously doesn't believe in
capitalism," she says, laughing. "He launches papers to make the case
that the market is the arbiter of all that is good, but his
newspapers lose spectacular amounts of money. He's the perfect
example that his model doesn't work"--at least at his high-profile
properties, excepting the Daily Telegraph.</TE>
<TE>   Black's newspaper model isn't just an economic one, but an
editorial one. David Radler, the president of Hollinger, explained
the company's editorial policy this way to the Canadian magazine
Maclean's: "If editors disagree with us ... then they're no longer in
our employ. The buck stops with ownership." And, oddly for a
newspaperman, Black's disdain for journalists--whom he calls
"swarming, grunting jackals"--knows no bounds. In his autobiography,
Black famously wrote, "One of the greatest myths of the industry: the
journalists are essential to producing a newspaper."</TE>
<TE>   His view clearly does not extend to his wife, Barbara Amiel, a
conservative Briton who is one of the Sun's featured columnists.
Acquaintances and critics of Black alike say their marriage is key to
understanding the man and his newspaper business. Fittingly, says
Fulford, the story goes that Black "acquired" her, like so many of
his papers. Having read her writing, Black decided she was to be his
second wife and proposed to her before they had any relationship.
Today, her columns express their shared ideals in the London
Telegraph, and now the Sun.</TE>
<TE>   While Black's personal politics will certainly find a place in New
York journalism as long as the Sun rises every weekday, its anyone's
guess how long that run might last and what role he'll play in
influencing public life in the city. "This project is designed to
make money--if it doesn't, it's a failure. And it's designed to
affect public life--if it doesn't, it's a failure. It's gotta do both
to succeed," Lipsky said, seated in his office off the newsroom.</TE>
<TE>   But the notion that the paper--and Black along with it--will
succeed financially is laughable to main members of New York's media
elite. At the party Tina Brown threw two weeks ago at her midtown
home to celebrate the launch, tipsy guests were reportedly placing
bets on how long the paper would last--one year or two.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way they'll make any money--all it is for is
politics," said New Yorker editor and opinion writer Hendrik
Hertzberg. "That's the main reason anyone would want to invest in a
venture like this that has no chance of making money--to advance an
ideology," he said. "And because they love publishing. I doubt it
will have much impact on politics, but it will certainly add to the
discussion, and that's always a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what his Rosebud is, but I suspect it's this
desperate need to be seen as successful at this game," said Toronto
Star editor Jim Travers. Whether New York desires a press baron
reminiscent of an era past and another daily broadsheet published
blocks from the ground zero scar that has come to represent the
complexities and chaos of our modern age--that's anyone's guess. But
with all the buzz about this man and his venture, it seems Brown's
guests aren't the only ones placing wagers--and that it's Black who
is perhaps making the greatest gamble of all.</TE>

<LD>VIRGINIA WOOLF</LD>
<LD>   Becoming a Writer</LD>
<LD>   By Katherine Dalsimer</LD>
<TE>   Yale University Press</TE>
<TE>   206 Pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   The writer Virginia Woolf was obsessed by her mother, who died
unexpectedly when Virginia was just 13. This loss, combined with the
subsequent deaths of her half-sister, her father and her brother,
haunted the fledgling writer, who ultimately forged out of these
"sledge-hammer blows," as she called them, the literary art of her
impressive oeuvre. In "Virginia Woolf: Becoming a Writer,"
psychologist Katherine Dalsimer examines the impact that these
calamitous knocks had on Woolf, offering readers a fascinating,
psychoanalytically informed look into how Virginia Woolf became the
particular writer she was.</TE>
<TE>   Dalsimer pieces together a crisp, if pain-filled, portrait of a
young woman trying to make her way in what seemed an increasingly
hostile world, a woman who used literary art as her only shield
against profound loss. Most compelling, she considers a question
Woolf herself weighed and to which neither Woolf nor Dalsimer can
offer a clear-cut answer: Was Virginia Woolf's mental illness "a
terrible, wasteful obstacle to her creativity--or the necessary
condition for it?" (Woolf suffered acutely from manic depression,
ultimately committing suicide in 1941, at the age of 59, by walking
with stones in her pockets into the River Ouse near her Sussex,
England, home.)</TE>
<TE>   In this engaging work of psychobiography, Dalsimer weaves back and
forth among Woolf's early journals, written when she was 15, 17 and
21, interposing those thoughts with Woolf's letters, book reviews and
essays (including "On Being Ill," in which Woolf considers her mental
illness), as well as her novels, principally "To the Lighthouse,"
"The Voyage Out," "Mrs. Dalloway" and "Jacob's Room." Familiarity
with Woolf's books, while helpful, is not necessary to enter this
narrative.</TE>
<TE>   As a teacher and supervisor for psychologists and psychiatrists in
training, Dalsimer has found that close reading of literary texts is
excellent "ear training" for the kind of listening required in
clinical situations. "It opens to the attentive listener a complex
counterpoint between the patient's narrative, both verbal and
nonverbal, and the therapist's own emotional responses." It is also,
one might note, an excellent training for apprentice writers and for
readers who wish to delve deeply into texts. In what could be viewed
as a fine introduction to the art of close reading, Dalsimer takes
readers by the hand and shows us the treasures she finds. In "To the
Lighthouse," for example, there's the similarity between Mrs. Ramsay
and Woolf's idealized mother; the closeness between Lily's
relationship with her painting and Woolf's connection with her
writing; and the bone-gripping experience of loss that caps the
narrative.</TE>
<TE>   "From an early age," Dalsimer explains, "writing was as necessary
to her as the very air she breathed: before finishing one book she
began to envisage the next, to ensure that there would be no time
when she was not working. It was the writing that consoled and
sustained her--as much as it was possible for her to be consoled or
sustained."</TE>
<TE>   Particularly disturbing are Woolf's references, found in many of
her works, to being drowned, blissfully sinking below the surface. As
a 21-year-old, for example, Woolf took a newspaper mention about a
woman who committed suicide by drowning and wrote a provoking, highly
subjective essay taking on the thoughts of the drowned woman. "In
conjuring up the woman's sense of aban- donment," Dalsimer points
out, "... Woolf has lost whatever distance remained between herself
and her subject. She has slipped into the first person and into the
present tense."</TE>
<TE>   Knowing how Woolf's life would end, these references chill.</TE>
<TE>   "What a born melancholiac I am!" Woolf is quoted in a diary entry.
"The only way I keep afloat is by working.... Directly I stop working
I feel that I am sinking down, down. And as usual, I feel that if I
sink further I shall reach the truth."</TE>

<LD>Gregory Westin Wendt, a history writer, and I were talking about
plagiarism. He said, "I don't trust a writer who will steal another
person's work, because the next thing you know, he'll steal my girl."</LD>
<LD>   "It's probably so, but a woman wouldn't steal your girl."</LD>
<LD>   "Yes, but her male researcher might. Don't get me wrong, I can go
either way on plagiarism. My last book, 'Teddy Roosevelt and His
Other Women,' sold 3,000 copies. It was a flop in every respect, and
I was in despair until a writer named Rose Abel Jackson wrote 'Teddy
Roosevelt and the Other Women He Had Known.' Hers was a smash hit,
selling 400,000 copies. Out of curiosity, I bought a copy. The only
thing she changed was the dedication. I dedicated my book to my
daughter, Angel, and she changed the name of the dedication to her
daughter, Agatha.</LD>
<TE>   "There were no footnotes to acknowledge anybody else's work. I
thought about it for a while (for four minutes) and then I decided to
sue."</TE>
<TE>   Gregory then described his visit to the publisher, who when he
discovered Greg was an unsuccessful writer, made him wait three
hours. This is what happened next:</TE>
<TE>   The publisher finally let Gregory in. He said, "I'm sorry, we
don't buy works by writers who look like they have no talent."</TE>
<TE>   Gregory said, "This one is about Teddy Roosevelt and how he was a
Rough Rider in the house as well as on his horse."</TE>
<TE>   The publisher replied, "We've done that. Rose Abel won the
Pulitzer Prize for it, and she is scheduled to be on Larry King's
show next week. Now get out of here."</TE>
<TE>   Greg told him, "I am going to read from her book and then mine."
Before the publisher could stop him, Gregory began to read, "'Teddy
went into the woodshed with his secretary, Candy. He described to her
as they rolled in the hay, how he fell off his horse on San Juan
Hill.'"</TE>
<TE>   The publisher said, "So what? That's beautiful writing."</TE>
<TE>   "I will read from my book," Gregory told him. "'Teddy went into
the stable with his secretary, Candy. He described to her how he fell
off his horse on San Juan Hill.' Do they sound alike to you?"</TE>
<TE>   "Hardly at all," the publisher said.</TE>
<TE>   "Her book is full of similarities to mine. Every page of hers has
four or five paragraphs exactly like mine. I don't like to call
another writer names, but she is a plagiarist."</TE>
<TE>   The publisher was furious. "No one ever calls one of our writers a
plagiarist." He paced up and down the office. "Every day an
extortionist comes in here and threatens me." Then he said, "How much
do you want to remain silent?"</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking of maybe $150,000."</TE>
<TE>   The publisher replied, "That's ridiculous. Whoever heard of a
publisher settling for $150,000 over a few lousy words? I'll give you
a hundred thousand if you sign a confidentiality pact promising never
to talk to anyone about this case forever."</TE>
<TE>   When George finished his story, I asked him, "You took the money?"</TE>
<TE>   "Of course I did. Having someone steal your stuff pays much better
than trying to sell your own book."</TE>
<TE>   "But if you signed a confidentiality agreement, why did you tell
me the whole story?"</TE>
<TE>   "I had to tell someone. And I know you won't put it in the
papers."</TE>

<HD>Designer Dirt Sprouting Brisk Sales</HD>
<DH>Boutique soils, at $4 or so a bag, fuel a growing market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADRIAN HIGGINS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As consumers flock to garden centers this spring, they will find an
enticing array of brightly colored, prominently displayed packages of
... dirt.</LD>
<LD>   Shelling out $4 or so for a bag of soil might seem lunacy, but in
this age of bottled water and boutique coffees, the green industry is
counting on dirt becoming the next product fad. Designer dirt, that
is.</LD>
<LD>   The hunch seems to be paying off: The largest player in this
field, the Scotts Co. of Marysville, Ohio, reports vigorous consumer
response to its national brands of potting mixes, garden soil mixes
and mixes to repair lawns.</LD>
<TE>   Other companies have added to this lucrative market, including
Pursell Industries, which sells the Sta-Green brand; Premier
Horticulture, with Pro-Mix, and Schultz Co., with products bearing
its name.</TE>
<TE>   The transformation from dirt as a commodity to dirt as a premium
branded product has created a virtually new market of about $400
million a year, said Keith Baeder, Scotts' vice president for growing
media.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the fastest-growing category" of consumable lawn and garden
products, he said, which includes fertilizers, grass seed and
pesticides.</TE>
<TE>   Until relatively recently, dirt was sold as an unbranded
loss-leader commodity made regionally. In the 1980s, a company called
Hyponex began buying out local producers and created a national
brand. That company in turn was purchased by Scotts.</TE>
<TE>   Scotts, the biggest supplier of lawn-care products and seed, began
its own brand in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the market growth came after Scotts and Miracle-Gro
merged, and the company launched the Miracle-Gro Potting Soil line in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   The first products in the boutique dirt arena were potting mixes,
used for house plants, plants in pots and containers, hanging
baskets, window boxes and seed-starting trays. Then came boutique
garden soils, used for in-ground plantings of annuals, vegetables,
perennials and other ornamentals.</TE>
<TE>   Baeder said sales of potting mix have grown 13% a year, and the
Miracle-Gro brand now accounts for 35% of a market of about $320
million. The garden soil category, another $80 million trade, is
expanding at 25% a year.</TE>
<TE>   Gardeners can make their own soil concoctions, but the new branded
mixes do serve a need for weekend gardeners who put a premium on time
and who need small quantities.</TE>

<HD>A Book for L.A., 'Fahrenheit' Still Hits Hot Buttons</HD>
<DH>Ray Bradbury's '53 novel is a timely pick for a local
reading campaign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID L. ULIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like many lifelong readers, I view books as a solitary passion, a
pleasure best savored on one's own. I tend to be suspicious of
efforts to make books communal, to expand the relationship beyond the
one to one. In the abstract, I see the value of, say, the now-defunct
Oprah's Book Club, the way it exposed literature to a wide swath of
the culture, but the truth is that, when it comes to reading, I just
want to be left alone.</LD>
<LD>   Yet I can't help but feel a powerful affinity for the One Book,
One City L.A. campaign going on this month under the auspices of the
Central Library and the mayor's office. Partly, I suppose, that's
because it's hard to be cynical about anything that frames Los
Angeles in terms of literature, that pushes reading as an essential
filter for the city to understand itself.</LD>
<LD>   Equally compelling is the selection of Ray Bradbury's 1953 novel
"Fahrenheit 451" as the volume Angelenos are all meant to be reading,
a pick so oddly appropriate, it's hard to believe a politician made
the call. Reportedly chosen by Mayor James K. Hahn, "Fahrenheit 451"
is one of the iconic works of science fiction, a futuristic fable in
which literature is illegal and firemen are called to start fires,
not stop them, torching any building in which books have been found.</LD>
<TE>   "It's so timely, it's eerie," says Louise Steinman, director of
literary programs at the Central Library. "There's an urgency to talk
about censorship and civil liberties, to have a public discourse on
these issues. And this helps create a forum for that to happen in a
natural and comfortable way."</TE>
<TE>   The concern about censorship, of course, is hardly exclusive to
the present; as Leo Braudy, professor of English and cultural studies
at USC, points out, "It's always relevant in the current moment." Yet
in a society that seems hopelessly confused about the balance between
security and freedom, Bradbury's novel makes for an uncanny
cautionary tale. Immersing in its landscape--where war may be
declared at any instant, and people deflect their fear and
disaffection by watching interactive TV dramas or racing through the
streets in jet-propelled cars--is to find yourself in an
extrapolation of the present, with sparks of recognition flying off
nearly every page.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm afraid of children my own age," laments Clarisse, the
17-year-old misfit who helps plant the first seeds of doubt in the
mind of Montag, the novel's fireman protagonist. "They kill each
other. Did it always used to be that way? My uncle says no. Six of my
friends have been shot in the last year alone. Ten of them died in
car wrecks. I'm afraid of them and they don't like me because I'm
afraid."</TE>
<TE>   There's an immediacy here that builds further into the story. "If
you don't want a man unhappy politically," Bradbury writes later in
the novel, "don't give him two sides to a question to worry him; give
him one. Better yet, give him none. Let him forget there is such a
thing as war.... Give the people contests they win by remembering the
words to more popular songs or the names of state capitals or how
much corn Iowa grew last year. Cram them full of noncombustible data,
chock them so damned full of 'facts' they feel stuffed, but
absolutely 'brilliant' with information. Then they'll feel they're
thinking, they'll get a sense of motion without moving. And they'll
be happy, because facts of that sort don't change."</TE>
<TE>   What's interesting about "Fahrenheit 451's" politics is that, when
the book was written, Bradbury was commenting on his times, in which
the dawn of McCarthyism threatened the free flow of ideas. Its
continued relevance may have something to tell us about how little
things have changed. "I was writing about what I was beginning to
notice," Bradbury says. "About how we were encouraging people to be
dumb."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, that will be one of the topics at discussion groups
this week at about 20 library branches and Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf
stores throughout L.A. (For a full schedule, visit the library Web
site at www.lapl.org.)</TE>
<TE>   "For us," explains city librarian Susan Kent, "the focus is the
importance of books and reading, of libraries and the 1st Amendment."
Another reason, though, why "Fahrenheit 451" continues to
resonate--at least for Angelenos--is that it's very much an L.A.
book. Unlike Seattle, which inaugurated the "One Book, One City"
model in 1998 with Russell Banks' "The Sweet Hereafter," or Chicago,
which chose Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird," the idea here is to
read one of our own. Bradbury moved to Southern California as a
teenager and has often invoked the Central Library as his alma mater;
he wrote the original version of "Fahrenheit 451," a novella called
"The Fireman," on a rental typewriter in a library basement at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   His work, Braudy suggests, "has always dealt with individuals and
individual will in the face of an oppressive government trying to
impose its values, which corresponds to the theme of Southern
California individualism."</TE>
<TE>   Not only that, notes Kent, but "he remains in our midst" and is
participating in several of this month's events, including a
discussion at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, where he'll
announce the winners of a student contest on the novel's themes.</TE>
<TE>   "Young people," Kent says, "need the opportunity to meet writers,
to aspire to creativity, and we're hoping to stimulate that
interest." For his part, Bradbury sees the situation in starker
terms: "We need to teach our kids, or our society is dead in the
water."</TE>
<TE>   It's tempting to write off the matter of his accessibility as
overstated; the book is what's important, after all, not the author,
and books are available everywhere. But one of "Fahrenheit 451's"
most chilling messages is that society--its shape, its values--can
slip away from us, and, indeed, the censorship the novel decries
begins not with the government, but with the indifference of the
citizenry.</TE>
<TE>   "We're becoming, in many ways, a nonreading culture," Bradbury
says. "And if you don't read books, if you don't buy them, then you
don't have to burn them. One by one, you eliminate various kinds of
books from your society."</TE>
<TE>   The enemy, in other words, is ignorance, just as it always has
been. For writer and discussion group leader Marjorie Gellhorn
Sa'adah, there's no more powerful example of this than her experience
as a literacy tutor at Camp Scott, a juvenile probation camp for
girls run by L.A. County.</TE>
<TE>   Of her dozen or so high school-age students, most read at a
fourth-grade level or below. Despite a degree of frustration, Sa'adah
sees the One Book, One City program as an opportunity, a chance to
help her students feel connected to something larger, more communal,
than themselves. Though they are having some trouble with the level
of reading, the important thing, Sa'adah says, is for them to be able
to say, "We can do this. We are part of the city too."</TE>
<TE>   Listening to Sa'adah brings to mind the scene in "Fahrenheit 451"
in which Montag explains his own transition, his shift from fireman
to dissident. "We have everything we need to be happy," he reflects,
"but we aren't happy. Something's missing. I looked around. The only
thing I positively knew was gone was the books I'd burned in ten or
twelve years. So I thought books might help."</TE>
<TE>   That's all it takes, one moment of ignition, one flashpoint to
remind us of how much books can mean. "It's important," says
Steinman, "that there be a literary life in the city that extends
beyond writers. It's a good thing whenever people get together and
discuss ideas." Sa'adah agrees. "One girl," she says, "told me, 'I
think it's great he burns the books; I wish he'd burned all the
books.' But she changed her mind once she read it for herself."</TE>

<LD>National Arbor Day</LD>
<LD>   They work 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. They never go inside to
get out of the rain or cold. They don't rest or sleep. They make
their own food from carbon dioxide, water and light energy. They
often live more than 100 years. What are they?</LD>
<LD>   Trees! And April 26 is National Arbor Day, a time to celebrate the
role of trees in our lives. Here are some interesting things trees do
for us.</LD>
<TE>   * Trees take carbon from carbon dioxide, make glucose and then
convert some of it into cellulose and store it in their trunks.</TE>
<TE>   * At the same time trees take the carbon, they release oxygen back
into the air for us to breathe. Some trees can make up to 5 pounds of
pure oxygen a day.</TE>
<TE>   * Trees provide shade, helping to reduce the amount of energy
needed to cool our homes.</TE>
<TE>   * Trees help make the air we breathe better by removing dirt and
other pollutants from the air.</TE>
<TE>   * Trees provide homes and food for birds, insects and wildlife and
make our yards, gardens and homes more beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   * A tree is made up of about 5% leaves, 15% branches, 60% trunk,
15% large transport roots and 5% feeder roots.</TE>
<TE>   The arboretum's Arbor Day Celebration takes place Friday at 11:30
a.m., when three trees will be planted. At 3:30 and 4:30 p.m. there
will be a special tram tour to learn about the many trees at the
arboretum.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday and Sunday, children ages 12 and younger who visit the
arboretum will be given free Italian stone pine seedlings (while
supplies last). For more information on arboretum programs, visit
www.arboretum.org or call (626) 821-3222.</TE>

<HD>Serving as a Model</HD>
<DH>When she's not on a catwalk, Sudanese- born Alek Wek is an
advocate for refugees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE BRATSKEIR</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It is a grim, rainy day at the Chelsea Piers, where the fashion staff
of Allure magazine awaits the arrival of models for a 10-page photo
shoot. Alek (pronounced uh-LEK) Wek blows into the dark studio like a
crackling electrical storm. The 24-year-old model transcends the
stereotype of her trade. Tall, yes. She is 5 feet 11. Beautiful, yes.
But far from the average cover girl.</LD>
<LD>   Dressed in a baseball shirt and a long skirt, the model is clearly
at home in these surroundings. She slips a white lab coat over her
clothes and briefly catches up with another model, Kiara, before
plunking down in the makeup chair. It takes makeup artist Christian
McCullough only a short time to apply Wek's game face--moisturizer
and neon slabs of blue swiped across her eyelids.</LD>
<LD>   Born in southern Sudan and raised as part of the Dinka tribe, Wek
conjures up visions of an ancient African goddess. Yet she is so
streamlined and modern-looking that she could be cast in a movie as a
woman of the future.</LD>
<TE>   She appears to be carved from ebony. "She is," McCullough said,
"one of the blackest girls around." Her body is powerful, graceful,
statuesque and, against the trend, not surgically enhanced. Her hair,
which she said is unruly this day, is just a bit longer than a crew
cut. "I don't look good in hair," she said. With her round, baby face
and her blazing white, slightly gap-toothed smile, she defies
traditional standards of beauty.</TE>
<TE>   Wek is considered to be among the top fashion models in the world,
earning, according to several industry sources, millions of dollars a
year. In 2000 she was named Model of the Decade by the trend-setting
i-D magazine; she was MTV Model of the Year in 1997, and one of
People magazine's "50 Most Beautiful People" in 1999. But ask her to
define herself, and "model" might not be the first word Wek would
use. Daughter, sister, refugee, painter, social activist and designer
seem closer to her core than modeling. And though the glitzy job more
than pays for the pristine, three-story Brooklyn brownstone where she
has lived for two years with Cocoa, a pit bull, and her cats, Onyx
and Seema, there is not an obvious shred of evidence of a model's
lair here. Not an award, magazine cover or photo spread in sight. The
white plaster walls are covered, instead, with huge canvases painted
by Wek. In her upstairs office, one side of the room is a montage of
sketches, bits of materials and drawings of pocketbooks that reflect
her latest project, a handbag line.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in a thin, dark shirt, Diesel jeans and a chunky
turquoise-studded belt, Wek sinks into a cushy dark suede couch (a
gift from Coach, the leather company that included her in its Most
Influential People campaign). She transports herself back to
childhood in Sudan where her earliest memories are happy. Her world
collapsed when the civil war broke out in 1982. Soldiers fired guns
randomly into her house, schools were closed, electricity turned off.
On more than one occasion, her parents gathered their nine children
(Wek is the seventh) to move to another temporary location, literally
running for their lives. "We would just take a necessity--a bowl,
some food, a little bit of clothing. I can remember walking miles and
crossing the river on foot and walking through the bush," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The death of her father because of poor medical care in the
war-torn country was a pivotal point in Wek's life. "We couldn't be
there without him," she said. At 14, she fled. A family friend helped
get Wek and her younger sister on a plane to London, where she went
to stay with an older sister who had established residence several
years before.</TE>
<TE>   "I was terrified and didn't speak a word of English." Wek worked
odd jobs, everything from cleaning to supermarket cashiering to
assisting in a hair salon.</TE>
<TE>   By 18, Wek found her avocation while attending the London
Institute, where she studied painting and design. "I loved to paint,
and that's what satisfied my soul," she said. "It was like everything
is OK. I feel right." A British modeling agency representative
discovered Wek at 19 in a London market. "She asked me if I would
like to be a model. I thought she was joking or making fun of me, the
way people are always asking me why I don't play basketball. I
thought this cannot be for real, but it was."</TE>
<TE>   Her rise to superstardom was meteoric. "She's a supermodel,
although I hate that term," said Maja Edmonston, creative director of
IMG who represents Wek. "She is beyond one of our top 10 models. Her
personality makes her more interesting than anyone else. She defies
the law of modeling, and though she's not conventional, she is great.
She's a top earner who works as much as she wants to." Edmonston also
represents Tyra Banks, Gisele Bundchen and Heidi Klum. Allure
magazine's creative director, Paul Cavaco, concurs. "There is always
an unusual one in fashion. The one that makes a great picture. And
here she is with that shaved head, skinny body and big booty. When
you see that girl smile and look at the photo, it transcends the
page."</TE>
<TE>   He compares Wek to her physical opposite. "They said about Marilyn
[Monroe] that you could feel her flesh on the page. That's the
quality Alek has."</TE>
<TE>   Donna Karan regularly features Wek in her shows because, said
spokeswoman Patty Cohen, "Donna designs for the universality of women
and Alek illustrates that. She's not just a pretty face, but she's
very modern, and everything she wears becomes very memorable."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the fanfare, Wek has chosen not to forget the past. She
serves on the advisory board for the U.S. Committee for Refugees. She
speaks in New York-area schools to bring attention to the famine in
southern Sudan.</TE>
<TE>   In June 1998, Wek returned to Sudan under the USCR's auspices.
"She's been extremely helpful," said Caroline Brennan, a senior
development associate for the organization. "Her experience as a
Sudanese refugee adds a unique perspective. She has definitely had an
impact and been able to put a face on the plight of Sudanese
refugees."</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things this job gave me is the voice to be able to
give back," Wek said. "Not everybody is lucky enough to do this. It's
like there's a fire burning in Sudan, and no one's putting it out.
Innocent people are the ones suffering, and a lot of the world
doesn't know it's happening. If I didn't do this, I would feel
really, really selfish inside. To be able to possibly give another
human being an opportunity, that's priceless."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from this, for the past year, Wek has been working on a line
of handbags and belts that will debut next fall--a result of personal
need. "In this business, you travel so, so much and nothing was
working that well for me," she said. "The bags were falling off my
shoulder, and I didn't want to have to be looking around inside to
find what I needed. I wanted them to be great-looking and efficient.
It also came out of my painting. For years, I would see a shape I
liked and paint it in my idea book. It's something that lets me be
really creative, and it's fun."</TE>
<TE>   The line, Wek1933, is named to honor her father (it's the year of
his birth). An ambitious selection of 23 styles includes minaudieres,
lined with silk-screened patterns based on the lifelines of her
palms. One larger style is inspired by her father's briefcase, while
a group of woven leather shoppers with calfskin trim is based on bags
her mother used to carry in Sudan.</TE>
<TE>   Though the glam life has its appeal for the young woman,
traditional values still seem to guide her. She likes to party but
after 10 p.m. finds herself tuckered out and needing shut-eye. She
eschews the latest "place-to-be-seen" restaurants, preferring local
joints that serve spicy Dominican or Indian food. When she moved into
her brownstone, she couldn't get comfortable until her mother, Akuol,
came to bless the space. "She walked through it all with a gourd from
Sudan, something she made, and sprinkled water, giving each room a
blessing. There were many other spirits here," Wek said.</TE>
<TE>   As for a social life, Wek admits to having her first boyfriend.
"Of course, I've dated, but this is my first real steady
relationship," she said. A fabulous jet-setter beautiful person? "Oh,
no," she said, laughing. "He's a building contractor from the
neighborhood named Debo."</TE>
<TE>   The future looks bright for the young woman. "I think the sky's
the limit for Alek," said her agent, Edmonston. "Whether she goes
into acting, becomes a successful designer or stays modeling, she'll
be working until she's old and gray."</TE>
<TE>   Wek's take on it is simpler. "One of these days I will have a
family, but give me five or six years. For now, I am lucky to have a
career, I love my painting and I'm happy. And success to me is to be
happy."</TE>

<HD>Living Legends of Architecture</HD>
<DH>Case Study alumni reunite to celebrate their contributions
to California's housing history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Half a century ago they were American architecture's young Turks,
apostles of a bold new design style intended to meet Southern
California's climatic and cultural needs. They were brought together
by John Entenza, editor and publisher of the avant-garde monthly
magazine Arts &amp; Architecture, who had a vision: to foster the
creation of modern, easily constructed and affordable housing
prototypes that would address the demands of the postwar building
boom, primarily in the Los Angeles area. And for the 21 years between
1945 and 1966, the architects of the Case Study Houses program worked
to fulfill that iconoclastic ideal.</LD>
<TE>   On Sunday, when five of the program's surviving architects met at
the Museum of Contemporary Art in downtown Los Angeles, it was mainly
to be feted as living legends whose once-radical influence still
persists in contemporary building and design. The occasion was this
month's publication of "Case Study Houses: The Complete Program," a
lavishly produced, handsomely illustrated, 440-page tome that weighs
in at 13 pounds and is priced to move at $150. The book's publisher,
Taschen, which specializes in the arts and pop-culture related
topics, hosted the afternoon event at MOCA's auditorium, followed by
a reception and book-signing.The Case Study project's revolutionary
character lay in the belief that single-family houses, assembled from
standardized components and materials such as steel, glass and
aluminum, could be mass-produced like Oldsmobiles and sold at prices
that middle-class families could afford. The aesthetic called for
flat roofs, open floor plans that minimized internal walls, and the
use of sliding glass doors to encourage a seamless "indoor-outdoor"
lifestyle flow befitting the mild climate. Influenced by an earlier
generation of Modernist architects, such as Rudolf M. Schindler, the
36 Case Study plans expanded Modernism's vocabulary by, in the words
of the book's author, Elizabeth A.T. Smith, maximizing "the use of
technology in their design and construction" and rendering it
visible. In theory, the program added up to a bold assertion of
American liberal democratic values and postwar optimism.</TE>
<TE>   For the architects themselves--Donald C. Hensman, Edward
Killingsworth, Pierre Koenig, Don Robert Knorr and Beverley Thorne,
who were joined by acclaimed architectural photographer Julius
Shulman--Sunday was a rare and timely reunion. (A sixth Case Study
architect, Ralph Rapson, was supposed to attend the event but had to
drop out after breaking his leg, said Smith, who also attended
Sunday's gathering.)</TE>
<TE>   Now all in their 70s and 80s, the architects assembled just a few
weeks after a landmark Modernist home designed by the late Richard
Neutra, in Rancho Mirage near Palm Springs, was torn down. Although
the Maslon House, built in 1963, was not a Case Study house, it
embodied many of the program's most sacrosanct principles:
simplicity, elegance, environmental sensitivity and the innovative
use of modern building materials. Neutra was among several other
architects in the program, a group that included Charles Eames, Craig
Ellwood, A. Quincy Jones and Raphael Soriano.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of the Maslon House was repeatedly referred to on Sunday,
and Shulman included it in a brief slide-show presentation. Though
the structure had been "viciously and vulgarly" destroyed, Shulman
expressed hope that its loss might inspire more awareness of the
Modernist architectural heritage that still remains. "The only way we
can preserve is to create something wonderful out of a disaster, and
I think we can. It's never too late," he said during an hour-long
panel presentation, the afternoon's centerpiece.</TE>
<TE>   The discussion, a harmonious mix of warm reminiscence and
confident predictions about the Case Study program's enduring
significance, was moderated by Smith, chief curator of the Museum of
Contemporary Art in Chicago. As a former MOCA curator, Smith helped
spark the current resurgence of interest in the Case Study project by
curating MOCA's 1989 exhibition "Blueprints for Modern Living:
History and Legacy of the Case Study Houses." Despite the intervening
decades, the men's enthusiasm and pride in their historic labors was
undiminished.</TE>
<TE>   "The effect of the program is worldwide, as well as locally," said
Koenig, who continues to work in Los Angeles and has taught at USC
since 1964. When he began his practice, Koenig told the audience of
about 175 people, "houses had to have shutters and they had to have
shingles and they had to have a picket fence. They don't do it
anymore, and the reason is a lot of dedicated people."</TE>
<TE>   Koenig credited his colleague, Killingsworth, with supporting his
work and Shulman with popularizing it through his photography. In
particular, one of Shulman's pictures of Koenig's Case Study House
No. 22 (1959-60) has become a defining L.A. image, a still from a
virtual movie that invites viewers to project their own desires. Shot
at night, it depicts two well-dressed women sitting and talking in
the cantilevered home's living room, with endless rows of city lights
visible below the promontory and through a glass wall. A serene
vision of modern urban sophistication, it captures the glamorous ease
of upper-middle-class life: You can practically hear the cocktail
glasses clinking and the bossa nova tunes wafting from the hi-fi.</TE>
<TE>   Killingsworth also gave thanks to the Case Study program and
Entenza. Noting that much of his firm's subsequent work was in hotel
design, Killingsworth said, the program "certainly changed everything
for our firm." He also praised Taschen's book, which is chockablock
with sketches, renderings and other documentation, along with text
reproduced from Arts &amp; Architecture. "I told one of the Taschen
people the only thing they did wrong is, they should've had a little
boy go along with it to carry it," Killingsworth said, alluding to
the book's Gutenbergian proportions.</TE>
<TE>   In the book's introduction, Smith emphasizes the individuality of
each of the Case Study houses, despite the program's stated mandate
of creating prototypes. Several panelists concurred that their
designs were driven, not by a manifesto, but by particular design
problems. Koenig, for example, said two homes he designed for the
project, Case Study No. 21 and 22, were tailored for two entirely
different clients, lots and programs, though both featured exposed
steel and glass.</TE>
<TE>   But Koenig asserted the program also was "a social movement" that
helped challenge and remove long-standing restrictive housing
covenants based on racial and religious prejudices.</TE>
<TE>   Knorr said he "never turned down a job," because he always wanted
to solve the specific set of architectural challenges that the
prospective client had presented him. "Some clients are a real pain
in the butt and give you projects you really shouldn't do," he said.
"But I did."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking after the panel presentation, Thorne said that at the
time of the Case Study program "there were only a couple of nuts in
the Bay Area doing steel-frame houses. I wasn't on a mission; I just
solved problems on a hillside and ended up with these guys." Meeting
the other architects, Thorne said, was "a little spooky" because he
felt like "an interloper." "Some of this is as awe-inspiring to me as
they are to the audience," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the architects expressed concern about the fate of the
remaining Case Study homes. Hensman noted there had been a listing in
Sunday's edition of The Times that Case Study House No. 20, a
three-bedroom home in Altadena, designed by his firm of Buff, Straub
&amp; Hensman, has been put on the market at $575,000. He expressed the
hope that it could be restored and saved. Others seconded the need
for more preservation and enlightened patronage. "If there's anyone
in the audience tonight who wants to contribute a million dollars,
there's going to be a lady upstairs," Shulman joked at one point.</TE>
<TE>   There was little need to persuade audience members, many of whom
bought copies of Taschen's book and waited patiently in line for half
an hour to get them signed. "For many of us who knew them when they
were doing this work, it's a great, great experience," said Randell
Makinson, a Pasadena architect and expert on the turn-of-the-century
Arts &amp; Crafts movement master builders Charles and Henry Greene. Amy
Hoffecker, an Echo Park photographer and artist, said it is important
for Angelenos to learn about and value their architectural
inheritance. "You've got to get the word out," she said.</TE>

<HD>Music Taps an Emotional Wellspring</HD>
<DH>Harold Gould headlines an eloquent production of 'Old
Wicked Songs,' about a music teacher and student who learn to unlock
their feelings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP BRANDES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under the guise of a series of music lessons, "Old Wicked Songs" by
Jon Marans is really about the importance of reconnecting to our
emotionally severed lives as the only way to move past trauma and
grief. And with more than enough trauma and grief to go around these
days, Jenny Sullivan's eloquent staging for Ventura's Rubicon Theatre
proves a particularly timely revival.</LD>
<LD>   Modulating with deceptive ease between affable comedy and bitter
cynicism, veteran actor Harold Gould takes masterful command of the
stage as professor Mashkan, the Austrian music teacher whose
mercurial mood swings and mysterious past pose a constant challenge
to Stephen (Joseph Fuqua), a visiting young American pianist.</LD>
<LD>   Pinpoint timing and convincing naturalism in the exchanges between
the performers nails the underlying desperation in both characters.
Stephen, a child prodigy, is on the verge of abandoning his career
after recognizing himself as nothing more than an accomplished
mimic--coasting on technique without passion.</LD>
<TE>   Plunged into the ornate, disquietingly erotic Viennese decor of
Mashkan's studio (a lushly rendered set by Thomas A. Giamario),
Stephen is so dissociated he needs to wear a tie to remind himself
he's alive.</TE>
<TE>   Sugarcoating his penetrating insights into Stephen's emotional
blockage, Gould's Mashkan pries the pupil from sterile, uptight
intellectualism through a mandatory tour of composer Robert
Schumann's "Dichterliebe"--a work Stephen dismisses at first as
indulgent romanticism. Forced to abandon his keyboard and assume the
singing role, Fuqua's Stephen flounders hilariously, bereft of
familiar moorings as he tries to navigate the tone poem's strange
emotional currents.</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with the dangerous, demonic role of art identified by
the German novelist Thomas Mann, the forces unleashed by these
lessons prove equally disruptive for Mashkan. Gould's moving
portrayal shows the erosion of the defenses the professor has
carefully constructed to keep at bay the overwhelming legacy of the
Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   Shrewdly set in 1986, on the eve of Kurt Waldheim's election to
the Austrian presidency despite reports of his past Nazi
affiliations, Marans' two-character drama mirrors an entire society
coming to grips with its troubled past.</TE>
<TE>   The integration of Schumann's song cycle into the evolving action
is one of the production's strengths. Gould performs some of the
keyboard passages himself, with music director David Potter supplying
the tracks for more challenging passages, convincingly delivered
through the onstage piano via Yamaha Disklavier software. As Fuqua's
singing gains in assurance, so does his character's ability to lead a
life of authentic feeling--a bit of stage alchemy whose ultimate
measure of success is whether it engulfs the audience as well. And
thanks to this expertly crafted, schmaltz-free production, it does.</TE>

<HD>Liturgies Shimmer in Dialogos Performance</HD>

<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the warm and welcoming acoustic of the high-vaulted sanctuary of
the Church of the Precious Blood, on Wilshire Boulevard, the seven
female voices of Dialogos gave a stunning United States debut
performance of an unusual program called "Terra Adriatica" Sunday
night.</LD>
<LD>   This agenda included liturgical pieces in Latin and Italian from
the 11th to the 14th centuries and later examples of Croatian chant.
Led by their founder-director and fellow singer, Katarina Livljanic,
the women of Dialogos deliver all this music with fervor, stylistic
subtleties and the projection of specific narrative moods.</LD>
<LD>   Passionate and word-sensitive, these performances reinstated the
details of Christian ritual with spontaneous energy.</LD>
<TE>   Technically, every note fell into its rightful place in a
continuity of meaning rooted in beauty of tone: With nearly
vibratoless sounds, the women produced an authentic vibrancy that can
make ancient music contemporary.</TE>
<TE>   Consisting of two contraltos, three mezzo-sopranos and two
sopranos, the ensemble performs with single-minded word delivery and
perfect intonation.</TE>
<TE>   The singers--representing several different nations but based in
Paris--moved around the performing area, forming various groupings,
and without mugging, their expressions reflected each piece's musical
mood.</TE>
<TE>   At the 8 p.m. performance (there had been one in the afternoon),
most of the lighting was provided by candles. The concert, on the
Chamber Music in Historic Sites series, matched an appropriately
sumptuous setting (the church was built in 1926) with sumptuous
music.</TE>

<HD>NPR Finds New Home for Its West Coast Push</HD>
<DH>Radio* The Culver City facility figures prominently in new
cultural reporting plans announced last week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>National Public Radio will announce today it has settled on a Culver
City location for its new West Coast production center, planned to be
the network's largest facility outside its Washington, D.C.,
headquarters.</LD>
<LD>   When it opens in September, the center will house about 90
employees, including NPR's Los Angeles news bureau, currently based
downtown, as well as "The Tavis Smiley Show," a one-hour magazine
program hosted by Smiley, an L.A.-based author, commentator and
former Black Entertainment Television talk-show host.</LD>
<LD>   Smiley's program, which debuted in January, is NPR's first show to
originate from Los Angeles and is in negotiations to gain an
affiliate locally. It's currently heard on 21 stations in the U.S.,
including New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore.</LD>
<TE>   NPR officials say they want a West Coast presence to help
revitalize and broaden their cultural programming, stories about
emerging trends, the business of entertainment, new media and new
music. They also want to tap into sources and audiences--such as
Asians, Latinos and youth--now underrepresented on the network.</TE>
<TE>   NPR Executive Vice President Ken Stern said the expansion is key
to the network's plan to overhaul its approach to arts, music and
entertainment programming, announced last week, noting that NPR
currently has arts reporters stationed only on the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   "American culture is by no means just New York and Washington.
There are other voices out there," Stern said. "One of the things we
want to accomplish here is to expand our arts coverage so it
encompasses more of the country. And California is very much a
thought leader."</TE>
<TE>   It's also one of NPR's largest audience pools--according to
Arbitron ratings, nearly 3.2 million Californians listen to the
network weekly, about 13% of its nationwide audience.</TE>
<TE>   In its cultural reorganization, NPR said it will revamp shows such
as "Performance Today," heard weekdays at 11 a.m. on KCSN-FM (88.5),
cutting back on commentary and interviews and focusing more on music.</TE>
<TE>   A new midday show in the works for the end of 2002, meanwhile, is
slated to be a newsmagazine with "more of a cultural bent," said NPR
spokeswoman Jenny Lawhorn, featuring arts coverage and originating
from the L.A. production center.</TE>
<TE>   The two buildings, on 1.76 acres in the 9900 block of Jefferson
Boulevard, were formerly the home of an Internet broadcaster and will
need only a few acoustic and technical improvements to be
radio-ready. The facility also is scheduled to serve as the network's
backup operation in case of emergency.</TE>
<TE>   NPR bought the property from Welk Group Inc., the holding company
for the Lawrence Welk family interests. The network funded half of
the $12-million cost to acquire, equip and operate the facility, with
the rest coming in donations.</TE>

<HD>Recalling Maria Felix: Frailty, Thy Name Is Not Woman</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALVADOR CARRASCO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Frailty, thy name is woman!" When Shakespeare wrote those words for
"Hamlet," he could not have imagined there would someday be a woman
such as Maria Felix.</LD>
<LD>   First, full disclosure: Her death doesn't touch me as much as it
moves me to reflection. I never met her, I don't idolize her, and I'd
be lying if I said her films influenced me in terms of becoming a
film director. By the time I was born, Maria Felix--Mexican actress
of mythical proportions, inimitable life force, the yardstick by
which the character of Latin women is often measured--had made 46 out
of the 47 films that made her famous in Mexico and abroad.</LD>
<LD>   She didn't see any films of my generation because in her eyes all
post-golden-age Mexican cinema was worthless: In one of her last
interviews she said, "I don't see any Mexican movies because I don't
feel like seeing bad stuff."</LD>
<TE>   Notwithstanding her contempt for us, there's something about Maria
Felix's image as a celluloid heroine that is forever embedded in
Mexican cinema--past, present and future--and something about her
fastidiously designed image in real life that is part of Mexican
identity.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because my lovely wife, Andrea, is English and I'm
Mexican, we're always finding surreal parallels between our cultures.
The latest has to do with the deaths, barely a week apart, of two
iconic women from our glorious nations: the very Mexican Felix ("The
Diva of Divas," "Maria Bonita," "La Dona") and the very British Queen
Mother ("The Icon of the Century," "The Nation's Favorite
Grandmother," "The Queen Mum").</TE>
<TE>   In the days since Felix's death on April 8, a few lost souls have
been vying for succession to the anachronistic title of "Diva of
Divas," a notion as preposterous as the idea of royalty in a country
like Mexico. What is the purpose of royalty, or of divas for that
matter, as we face the new century?</TE>
<TE>   Does their "highness" help us cope with our lowness? Can we escape
the vicissitudes of reality by attempting to fly with their melted
wings? Felix asserted that being an actress means dreaming your life
away so that others can partake of the illusion. Granted that "La
Dona" was the quintessentially Mexican take on royalty. Was she
completely out of touch with common people, or did she understand
them so profoundly that she sacrificed her own person to create an
everlasting myth? She held that she behaved exactly the same way in
public as when she was alone in the sanctity of her restroom: always
beautiful, invulnerable and dignified.</TE>
<TE>   For the sake of her and our sanity, I want to believe that when
she was truly alone she would remove the other mask, the one that
cannot be covered with makeup, and occasionally shed a tear like
those miraculous Madonnas that can't be held wholly accountable for
all the folly committed in their names.</TE>
<TE>   For a crash course on Maria Felix I'd suggest the
not-so-celebrated 1958 film "La estrella vacia" ("The Empty Star"), a
grueling portrait of a beautiful woman who sacrifices it all in order
to become a movie star. What's fascinating is that it's not one of
those melodramas in which the protagonist is severely and
misogynistically punished for her sins. She actually becomes rich,
famous, independent and powerful. And she chooses to remain empty
inside. Literally.</TE>
<TE>   Due to an abortion, she cannot bear children anymore, but she
takes it stoically, more like Clytemnestra than like the actress Sara
Garcia (Mexico's own favorite grandmother). There's a certain
sincerity and poignancy in this film that stands firm ground against
the lifelong criticism that Felix received for being a diva, yes, but
not a good actress. I was drawn to her precisely because she doesn't
view herself as a victim. On the contrary, she's creating her own
destiny, and if it's hard being a woman, it's even harder to be Maria
Felix. Here's a precursor of the great female roles that we are yet
to see in this un-golden age of ours. Near the end of "La estrella
vacia," there's a scene in which her father reassures her, "But
you're a good person," and she vehemently replies, "Don't say that!"</TE>
<TE>   Which brings me back to the analogies with the Queen Mum, always
full of palatable quotes: "You think I am a nice person. I'm really
not a nice person," the Icon of the Century once told a confidant.</TE>
<TE>   It would seem that the primary raison d'etre of royalty in
general, and of Felix and the Queen Mum in particular, has been to
cultivate legendary images of themselves for the sake of "their"
people. Despite the obvious differences--Felix exuded sex, the Queen
Mum did not--both came from large families, became paradigms of
longevity and ascended from simple origins to considerable wealth.
Both were passionate about breeding horses.</TE>
<TE>   Felix inherited 87 thoroughbreds from one of her five husbands,
the one who called her "Puma," and became, in her own words, the
Queen of European Hippodromes. For the Queen Mother, racing horses
allowed her a much-needed breathing space from the royal family.</TE>
<TE>   Both spent lavishly: Maria Bonita would travel with suitcases
bursting with cash--mind you, she only handled new bills--and she had
the illness of silver, which could only be cured by Dr. Tiffany or
Nurse Buccelati. Once a suitor in the shady form of a rich Mexican
politician sent a planeload of flowers and chocolates to her film
set, and she asked him to return it instead full of maize, rice and
beans to distribute among the local Indians. Though she never handled
bills herself, not even new ones, the Queen Mum incurred a bank
overdraft of more than $6 million. While Maria virtually patented a
style of smoking cigars, the Queen Mum kept in good health with a
little help from gin.</TE>
<TE>   On a darker note, both were indirectly responsible for the demise
of a daughter and a son whom they tragically outlived: the Queen Mum
is famously blamed for ruining Princess Margaret by thwarting her
plans to marry a divorced war hero. Felix's only son, Quique,
professed a kind of iconic, quasi-Oedipal veneration for his mother,
which was most eloquently expressed in his lifelong habit of
collecting memorabilia about his own Queen Mum. Needless to say, he
never married and was the subject of endless rumors about his
sexuality. Surely Felix's heart was torn apart when her boy, her
"only true love," died in 1996 at age 62, yet not a tear was shed in
public. La Dona's worries, her weaknesses, her humanity, were simply
not part of the public persona.</TE>
<TE>   Both ladies were adored by people; both were severely criticized
for indulging in behaviors that scorned those very people who adored
them. And both Her Majesty and "The Mexican" (yet another epithet)
had a silent say in the respective timings of their deaths. The Queen
Mum was determined to witness the new century and died during her
sleep at 101 years of age, and Maria died exactly on her 88th
birthday, also dreaming her life away till the end. No one would be
surprised if La Dona went to sleep that night making a conscious
decision to die and even forewarning God about rules and conditions
to grace him with her presence in paradise.</TE>
<TE>   The most striking thing about Felix's funeral at the French
Pantheon in Mexico City was to see thousands of incredibly humble
people consumed by genuine, collective pain: We've lost her, our
Maria Bonita is gone! Why this reverence for someone who had such a
condescending, if not disdainful, attitude toward common people? Is
it, once again, the psychology of 500 years of colonization? What is
it about La Dona that made people stand in line for countless hours
and behave as if they had lost someone rooted within them or who in
some strange way symbolized them? Well, paradoxically enough, because
she is and she does.</TE>
<TE>   Felix, who was light-skinned and of predominantly Spanish descent,
became famous for playing, among other things, indigenous women and
Mexican revolutionary heroines. One theory for our people's
veneration toward her is the notion that she ennobled the race by
playing these ethnic roles. Now, there's a scary thought.</TE>
<TE>   But even if Felix's wasn't a royal indigenous face, what a
remarkable face it was! Crowned with eyes that could stare you down
but chose not to see many things, her face was a cinematographer's
dream and a painter's obsession, from Gabriel Figueroa's sublimated
lens to Diego Rivera's failed marriage proposal. A face with a
centripetal force that grabs you and won't let go. Spirit giving
voice to matter, character molding flesh and not vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   By today's paradigms of beauty, it was a face more like Angelina
Jolie's, attitudes and all, and less like La Dona's compatriot Salma
Hayek, whom, according to Mexican newspapers, Maria Bonita didn't
like very much. Regardless, Hayek, another icon in her own right,
made a point of attending La Dona's wake at the Palace of Fine Arts.</TE>
<TE>   She wasn't the only one: Fate had it that Maria Felix--who always
had the last word, who never took orders from anyone, who seduced all
her men, who would always be right about everything, and who would be
caught dead before she'd ever have to wait for anyone--had to wait
for her own coffin to be lowered into the crypt because the young pop
star Thalia was approaching.</TE>
<TE>   When she was spotted, mayhem erupted, people turned their backs on
La Dona's coffin and started asking the singer for autographs. The
world belongs to the living. Would La Dona mind? Perhaps. Is this the
passing of the torch? Never. Even Thalia remarked: "There won't be
another diva in the history of this country, not even me."
Unbelievable.</TE>
<TE>   But no less so than the fact that there is an ossuary in Rome, the
Cemetery of the Capuchin Friars, that bears an ancient tombstone with
the following inscription in Latin: "Hic jacet Maria Felix" (Here
lies, happy, Maria). May it be so.</TE>

Conquest," which had a limited release in L.A. and will open

<AU>PATRICK GOLDSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Back in the day (1975), Michael Korda, then editor in chief at Simon
&amp; Schuster, wrote a cheeky self-help book "Power!: How to Get It, How
to Use It," which offered advice on everything from what power color
to wear (blue) to how to avoid unsightly facial tics (apply Xylocaine
anesthetic ointment before an important meeting).</LD>
<LD>   Despite a chorus of derisive reviews, "Power!" became an instant
bestseller and caused an uproar in the publishing world because,
well, it was so vulgar and tasteless. Back then, one didn't boast
about the unbridled pursuit of corner offices or glorify the weaselly
art of brown-nosing one's superiors. As it turned out, Korda wasn't
just a philistine--he was a philistine ahead of his time. Today, no
one bats an eye at the naked quest for power.</LD>
<LD>   Corporate overlords like Jack Welch and Sumner Redstone pen
self-serving memoirs about their ascension to tycoon-hood, while
Barry Diller and Richard Parsons are lionized in the business press
as master synergists and empire builders. The ultimate symbol of our
obsession with these media barons has taken the form of the Power
List. Pioneered by Premiere, which just published its 13th in its May
issue, some version of the Power List is now a staple at such media
outlets as Entertainment Weekly and Vanity Fair.</LD>
<TE>   The Power List's appeal is obvious: It offers us lowly peons a
voyeuristic peek into the lofty aeries of the high-powered kingpins.
We see who's moved up or slipped a notch, what strengths or
weaknesses they have, concluding with a nugget of insider info (known
at Premiere as "Yes, It's True"). Thus we learn that Barry Diller,
ranked No. 3 this year, likes his shirts to match the office orchids.</TE>
<TE>   What depresses me about this is that the media and moviegoers
routinely complain that nobody makes good films anymore, but when it
comes time to put the spotlight on Hollywood insiders, the focus is
always on power, not who has a passion for film. Like so many of the
other titans at the top of the Power List, Rupert Murdoch (No. 4 on
the Premiere list) is a deal maker--he's no more enamored of movies
than whoever's running Kmart these days.</TE>
<TE>   So without further ado, here's my first Anti-Power List, exalting
a few artists and industry-ites who provide the movie business with a
touch of quality and class. (Longevity counts--everyone on this
alphabetical list needed a five-movie resume to qualify--but the only
power that counts here is the commitment to make good movies).</TE>
<TE>   Don Cheadle: Like his elders Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman,
Cheadle lends a bracing whiff of verisimilitude and gravitas to every
moment he's on screen. After burning up the screen as the menacing
Mouse in "Devil in a Blue Dress," Cheadle has been on a roll, whether
playing Sammy Davis Jr. in HBO's "The Rat Pack" or giving a string of
razor-sharp performances in such films as "Boogie Nights,"
"Bullworth" and "Family Man," where he's the hippest guardian angel
you've ever seen. Steven Soderbergh is no dummy--he's had Cheadle on
board for "Out of Sight," "Traffic" and "Ocean's Eleven."</TE>
<TE>   George Clooney: If you forgive Clooney for his Caped Crusader turn
in "Batman &amp; Robin," he's got a schlock-free clean slate of avoiding
cynical payday pictures. He takes risks ("Three Kings" and a live-TV
version of "Fail Safe"), headed up the Coen brothers' sleeper hit "O
Brother, Where Art Thou?" and glided through "Ocean's Eleven" and "A
Perfect Storm." To get a difficult movie made, he's only taking a
relatively modest $500,000 to direct and star in "Confessions of a
Dangerous Mind." More importantly, he's used his star clout to help
organize the "Tribute to Heroes" telethon, boycotted TV tabloids for
broadcasting paparazzi videos, and publicly criticized the Screen
Actors Guild for expelling obscure picket-line-crossing members but
ignoring big-name offenders.</TE>
<TE>   Joel and Ethan Coen: In an era obsessed with franchises, they've
cornered the market on a cerebral-but-cool brand of filmmaking on
display in such films as "Barton Fink," "Fargo" and "O Brother, Where
Art Thou?" They've concocted a uniquely detailed visual style, never
repeat themselves and have a deadpan film lingo all their own. Their
enviable stock company of actors includes John Goodman, John
Turturro, Steve Buscemi, Tony Shalhoub and Frances McDormand, who is
married to Joel and won a best actress Oscar for her role in "Fargo."</TE>
<TE>   Jersey Films: Run by Danny DeVito, Stacey Sher and Michael
Shamberg, this production company has an unparalleled record of
discovering and nurturing fresh film talent, whether it's Quentin
Tarantino ("Pulp Fiction"), Ben Stiller ("Reality Bites"), Cameron
Diaz ("Feeling Minnesota") and Scott Frank ("Get Shorty"), not to
mention collaborating with Soderbergh on intelligent mainstream fare
such as "Out of Sight" and "Erin Brockovich."</TE>
<TE>   Sean Penn: This suffers-no-fools actor is easily the most
uncompromising talent of his generation. After capturing the essence
of teen stonerdom in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," Penn has
consistently sought out acting challenges: In the '80s with "The
Falcon and the Snowman" and "At Close Range"; in the '90s with "Dead
Man Walking" and "Hurlyburly." He tried to give up acting (he's
directed Jack Nicholson in both "The Pledge" and "The Crossing
Guard") but returned as a jazz jerk in Woody Allen's "Sweet and
Lowdown" and with a wrenching turn as a retarded father fighting for
custody of his daughter in "I Am Sam."</TE>
<TE>   Terry Press: Hollywood's best movie marketer, she makes it a point
of personal pride never to use junket blurbs in her ads. In an era in
which studio marketing is more crass than ever, Press and her
DreamWorks team helped build "American Beauty" from a critics'
favorite to an Oscar winner and mold "Shrek" into a mega-hit. Blunt
with filmmakers and journalists alike, she's ingenious enough to
transform "Gladiator" into a modern-day epic, successfully open a dud
like "The Time Machine" and sell a Harrison Ford film ("What Lies
Beneath") without showing his face on the poster.</TE>
<TE>   John Sayles: the model of a fiercely independent filmmaker. Having
started as a novelist and B-movie screenwriter, he's built a
no-compromise career as the rare filmmaker who doesn't just talk
politics, but tests his beliefs in his films. In movies such as
"Return of the Secaucus Seven," "Matewan," "City of Hope" and "Lone
Star," he's explored ethnic conflicts, questioned generational values
and celebrated regional cultures roundly ignored in most Hollywood
films.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Sarandon: In a town where actresses are thrown on the scrap
heap at 40, Sarandon has enjoyed a dazzling career spanning four
decades, earning four Oscar nominations in the 1990s alone, including
a best actress statuette for her role in "Dead Man Walking." Who else
can say they worked with Billy Wilder (in "The Front Page") and
Natalie Portman (in "Anywhere But Here")? Memorable films include
"Pretty Baby," "The Hunger," "Atlantic City," "The Witches of
Eastwick," "Bull Durham" and "Thelma and Louise," not to mention a
side career as a voice actress in "Rugrats in Paris" and "Cats and
Dogs."</TE>
<TE>   James Schamus and Ang Lee: Hollywood's most unique creative team.
Schamus has written all but one of Lee's films while also helping run
Good Machine, the production company behind such indie breakouts as
"Happiness" and "In the Bedroom." After leaving Taiwan, Lee has
carved out an almost blemish-free Hollywood career, moving from
art-house fare such as "Sense and Sensibility" to the spectacular
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." How good are they? Who'd really be
looking forward to "The Incredible Hulk" next year if this team
weren't helping make it?</TE>
<TE>   Working Title Films: Together for a decade, Tim Bevan and Eric
Fellner have turned this British production company into a classy,
commercial powerhouse. "Bridget Jones's Diary" and "Four Weddings and
a Funeral" were both worldwide hits.</TE>
<TE>   The duo also served as producers on "Billy Elliot," "Notting
Hill," "Dead Man Walking" and five Coen brothers movies, including
their biggest success, "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" Up next is "About
a Boy," a Weitz brothers adaptation of the Nick Hornby novel starring
Hugh Grant and Rachel Weisz.That's my list--if you have any other
nominations for the Anti-Power List, send them along.</TE>

<HD>Argentine Legend Sings of Love, Hope</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Argentina's folk legend Mercedes Sosa never directly addressed her
country's convulsive economic crisis during her excellent two-hour
concert at UCLA's Royce Hall on Sunday. But she didn't have to. As
always during Sosa's remarkable 40-year career, her songs spoke for
her heart.</LD>
<LD>   It was impossible not to think of her nation's desperate situation
when she sang the hopeful, determined lyrics of Alberto Cortez's
"Cancion de amor para mi patria," (Love Song for My Homeland), a call
for people to come together, hide their tears and move forward.
("Vamos arriba! Que no se diga que estas llorando.") The stalwart
singer held the long final note, softly and sweetly, then delicately
wiped her eyes with a white handkerchief. If those were tears, they
had not choked her masterful control.</LD>
<LD>   Sosa has said that she regrets the one time she let herself cry on
stage, during a song that evoked the pain of her self-imposed exile
in 1979 during Argentina's murderous military dictatorship. A
performer should be strong and commanding, she says, and she fully
lived up to that standard in Sunday's moving performance, her first
here in six years.</LD>
<TE>   The 66-year-old pioneer of the "new song" movement, which fused
folklore and politics in the 1960s, has battled health problems and
depression recently. But "La Negra," as she's affectionately
nicknamed for her dark, indigenous looks, certainly appeared to be
enjoying herself. She chatted with the capacity audience like a
beloved grandmother, occasionally raising her famously portly frame
to do a few graceful dance steps, waving that white handkerchief
jauntily over her head.</TE>
<TE>   The acoustics of this stately concert hall helped highlight her
magnificent voice, as did her tasteful and tailored four-piece band.</TE>
<TE>   Sosa graciously identified the composers of almost every tune,
from Violeta Parra's tender reflection, "Gracias a la vida," to Fito
Paez's uplifting "Y Dale Alegria."</TE>
<TE>   Her adoring fans clapped and sang along. Though Argentines were
out in force, the singer's playful roll call of Latin nations showed
fans came from virtually every country (including the unmentioned
United States, from a look around the room). The turnout was a
fitting tribute to this humble daughter of the town of Tucuman who
makes us feel her cherished music belongs to us all.</TE>

<HD>This 'Wild Duck's' a Strange Bird</HD>
<DH>Ibsen's classic play manages to overcome some heavy-handed
tinkering by its director and set designer in a revival at A Noise
Within.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Guest director Adrian Giurgea and set designer Danila Korogodsky,
collaborators on Henrik Ibsen's "The Wild Duck" at Glendale's A Noise
Within, are willing to try just about anything in their version of
Ibsen's tragicomedy about what happens to two families when truth
becomes a weapon.</LD>
<LD>   The result is definitely not a tame "Duck"--but in the overeager
hands of Giurgea and Korogodsky, it's sort of a strange duck.
Luckily, the play is strong enough to withstand their good
intentions. This "Wild Duck" succeeds not because of their theatrical
tinkering, but in spite of it.</LD>
<LD>   Posted on the doors outside the theater is a warning: "The Wild
Duck" is two hours and 45 minutes long, including one 15-minute
intermission--a little daunting, no matter how committed one might be
to theater (and Friday's opening night audience was committed indeed;
one brave attendee was overheard to observe: "We've been through
'King Lear' here; we can do anything").</LD>
<TE>   Faced with the challenge of the modern American attention span,
one can hardly blame the creative forces behind the production for
trying to make sure that a long, old play by a dead Norwegian
contains enough innovation to make the journey worthwhile. But
oddball elements of the set, as well as an over-the-top quality to
some performances clearly dictated by the director, argue with the
elegant clarity of the story. This play is good--it's hung around
since 1884. There's no need to try quite this hard.</TE>
<TE>   This is particularly true of certain maddening elements of
Korogodsky's set. The play opens with a party scene at which the
first gossipy details that lead to a long, inevitable journey toward
tragedy begin to be revealed. Problem is, you can't hear them. The
scene is played behind a big, incongruously modern-looking window
wall at the back of the stage. It's not that the actors are not
speaking loudly enough, but there's a tinny distortion of the voices
through the glass. Act 1, Scene 1 of a two-hour-and-45-minute play is
way too early to find yourself saying, "Huh?"</TE>
<TE>   Luckily, the action moves quickly from behind glass to the front
of the stage, which variously serves as a garden or the modest home
of Hjalmar Ekdal (Geoff Elliott) and wife Gina (Julia Coffey), the
hapless couple who suffer most at the hands of moralistic do-gooder
Gregers Werle (Dougald Park). Here, the few simple sticks of
furniture are all that's needed.</TE>
<TE>   But not enough, apparently, for Korogodsky. If you couldn't hear
the actors behind the glass, in front of the glass, Korogodsky seems
hell-bent on making sure you can't see them, either.</TE>
<TE>   A large, black, T-shaped structure--much like empty girders on a
construction site, and as jarringly contemporary as the
window--stands mid-stage. It serves no apparent purpose save to
impair sight lines. The thing doesn't cause a total obstruction of
vision, just intrudes enough to occasionally make you wonder what
you're missing. You need the press notes to know that this steely
contraption "represents the here and now," in contrast to lost
innocence.</TE>
<TE>   This play already has a wounded wild duck flapping around in the
attic; Ibsen's got that symbolism pretty much covered.</TE>
<TE>   Director Giurgea also goes half a step too far. Possibly in an
attempt to make sure the melodrama doesn't overwhelm Ibsen's intended
comedy, Giurgea pushes most of the cast, especially Elliott and
Coffey, into cartoon territory. While an audience must recognize
their absurdity, surely they shouldn't see it--and even seem to
deliberately play to it--themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Giurgea does, however, coax a natural, sweetly somber performance
from Lily Nicksay as 14-year-old Hedvig Ekdal, the innocent whose
very life depends on a secret web of lies. With her hopeful but
worried dark eyes and face pale as the moon, she's a heartbreaking
victim. But Giurgea's choice to add another actress in a wig
portraying a sort of ghostly reflection of the girl on the opposite
side of that irritating window is, once again, more than we needed to
know.</TE>

<LD>   'Billy Elliot' Inspires Young Male Dancers</LD>
<LD>   London's Royal Ballet has succumbed to the "Billy Elliot" effect,
it seems.</LD>
<TE>   For the first time in its 76-year history, the institution has
accepted more boys than girls--a development that officials there
chalk up, in part, to the release of the 2000 film in which the
11-year-old son of a coal miner leaves home to pursue a ballet
career.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the enrollment at both the Royal Ballet's junior and
senior schools will be made up of 14 boys and only 10 girls. Last
year, eight boys and 12 girls joined White Lodge, the junior school
for 11- to 16-year-olds to which the film's hero won acceptance.
"There has been a significant increase in the number of boys who want
full-time training and are willing to take on ballet as a vocation,"
said Gailene Stock, director of the Royal Ballet School. "The film
has certainly had some effect on the younger boys. A number ... have
said that 'Billy Elliot' made them feel more comfortable about
telling people they are ballet dancers."</TE>
<TE>   Architect Sought for  Lincoln Center Design</TE>
<TE>   Aiming to rebuild Manhattan's 40-year-old Avery Fisher Hall as
part of a $1.2-billion redevelopment effort at the Lincoln Center for
the Performing Arts, officials of the Lincoln Center and the New York
Philharmonic Orchestra have invited symphonic-hall design proposals
from a short list of big-name architects.</TE>
<TE>   Though current plans call for a 2,400-seat symphony hall at a cost
of $340 million, much of the redevelopment is still under discussion
as the center's 13 resident cultural organizations continue to raise
funds and skirmish over details.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Lincoln Center leaders invited 11 firms to
submit proposals for a new symphony hall, with interviews to follow
in May and selection in October. Rebecca Robertson, executive
director of the Lincoln Center Constituent Development Project, said
the architects invited to compete included the following: Frank
Gehry; Renzo Piano; Sir Norman Foster; Arata Isozaki; Toyo Ito;
Richard Meier; the firm of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill; Rafael Moneo;
Rem Koolhaas; Jean Nouvel and Christian de Portzamparc.</TE>

<TE>   Sharon Documentary Pulled From Festival</TE>
<TE>   The Toronto Jewish Film Festival has scrapped plans to show "The
Accused," an award-winning documentary on Ariel Sharon, Israel's
controversial prime minister, because of security concerns. The BBC
film, investigating Sharon's involvement in the 1982 Israeli invasion
of Lebanon, was to be screened today.</TE>
<TE>   "This seems to be a more explosive year, security-wise, so we're
just trying to be careful," festival director Helen Zukerman told the
Toronto Star. "We don't want it co-opted by some special-interest
groups that might seize it to make their own political statement."</TE>
<TE>   Zukerman insists that the decision to drop the film was made not
because of external pressure, but because it could divert attention
away from the rest of the offerings. "We don't want the film to
become the festival," she said.</TE>

<TE>   Journalist Sues Disney, New York Post</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment journalist Nikki Finke has filed a $10-million suit
against the New York Post, its parent company News Corp. and the Walt
Disney Co., claiming the studio pressured the newspaper to fire her
in the wake of two Jan. 29 stories she wrote about litigation
surrounding Disney's "Winnie the Pooh" license. She was dismissed
Feb. 19.</TE>
<TE>   Filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Friday, the suit charges
the defendants with breach of contract, slander and libel. The only
reason given for her termination, she said, was a Disney complaint
about her pieces.</TE>
<TE>   Finke maintains that the two media giants collaborated to silence
a truthful report about the studio's destruction of documents and the
economic consequences of losing the license.</TE>
<TE>   "In the annals of journalism, this has to rank as one of the
supreme acts of cowardice by a newspaper owner currying favor with a
major advertiser and business partner," said Finke's attorney, Pierce
O'Donnell. "Nikki Finke is the innocent victim of a colossal abuse of
corporate power."</TE>
<TE>   Disney declined to comment Monday, but a spokesman for the Post
called the lawsuit "ridiculous" and said "the notion that the Post
gave favorable treatment to Disney is laughable."</TE>
<TE>   An Upside to Divorce--L.A. Style</TE>
<TE>   In the "Only in L.A." category: All Southland residents who were
officially divorced in April or May of this year will be admitted
free to Steven Dworman's new independent film "Divorce--The Musical,"
opening Friday at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   People must show certified divorce papers at the box office in
order to take advantage of the offer.</TE>

<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   The cast of "Follies," which comes to the Wadsworth Theatre June
15-23, will include Vikki Carr, Patty Duke, Harry Groener, Carol
Lawrence and Grover Dale....PBS will introduce a new weekly
international documentary series, "Wide Angle," on July 11. The

<HD>Producers Pull Backing From New Star</HD>
<DH>Theater* Before his big opening in 'Producers,' Henry
Goodman has been dropped as Nathan Lane's replacement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK PACHECO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Henry Goodman, the much ballyhooed replacement for Nathan Lane in
Broadway's "The Producers," was himself replaced in the role of Max
Bialystock after Sunday's matinee, two weeks before he was to open
for the critics.</LD>
<LD>   The British actor--along with Steven Weber, who took over for
Matthew Broderick--began performances in the Mel Brooks smash on
March 19. Rumblings surfaced early on that the producers and creative
team were unhappy with Goodman's performance, but the rumors of a
replacement were denied, and a press date of May 1 was set for the
official opening of the new stars.</LD>
<LD>   But Sunday, the producers of "The Producers" decided to cut their
losses by letting Goodman go and giving the role to Brad Oscar, who
received a Tony nomination for his performance as Franz Liebkind, the
Nazi playwright in the musical.</LD>
<TE>   "I have the utmost respect for Henry Goodman," Susan Stroman, the
"Producers" director and choreographer, said in a statement released
Monday morning by the show's publicists. "He is a wonderful actor,
and I would happily work with him again on another project. Henry has
been very well-received by audiences nightly, but the producers have
decided to pursue a different quality for the role."</TE>
<TE>   As Lane's understudy, Oscar performed the role of Max several
times in the past year and has received favorable notice from
occasional reviews. He is currently co-starring with Weber, who
remains with the show.</TE>
<TE>   No one from "The Producers" would officially comment on the
drastic action, but a person close to the production, speaking
anonymously, said of Goodman: "He just wasn't funny. There was no
chemistry between him and Steven." Asked if that problem had not been
apparent in the audition process, the person responded, "Sometimes
auditions can be very different from actually getting up in front of
an audience. It really was a question of a bad fit because Henry
really is very talented."</TE>
<TE>   While virtually unknown in the U.S. (he was part of a replacement
cast in the long-running Broadway play "Art"), the classically
trained Goodman is something of a critics' darling in London for his
award-winning performances in "The Merchant of Venice" and in Stephen
Sondheim's "Assassins." It is not unusual for actors to be fired when
a show is in development or even previews. But it is virtually
unheard of for an actor who is a replacement in a long-running show,
particularly one as well-established as "The Producers," which won a
record 12 Tony Awards last year.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, many insiders see the casting change as a desperate
attempt to protect the show's franchise. Since the departure of Lane
and Broderick, advance ticket sales have fallen off--and the $480 VIP
tickets have gone begging--though the show is still grossing more
than $1 million a week. The official critics' opening remains May 1.</TE>
<TE>   The touring production of "The Producers" is scheduled to come to
Los Angeles' Pantages Theatre in April 2003. No casting has been
announced.</TE>

<HD>'Dead Man' Gets a New Life</HD>
<DH>Opera* A phenomenon in San Francisco, the show reappears in
Orange County in a staging that has been altered to better travel to
other cities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New American operas usually have a hard time making it, but Jake
Heggie's "Dead Man Walking," the story of Sister Helen Prejean and
her ministry to death row inmates and their victims, set box office
records at San Francisco Opera, which commissioned and premiered it
two years ago. It's since taken on its own life.</LD>
<LD>   More than seven companies are lined up to present it, and first on
the list is Opera Pacific, which presents the show beginning tonight.</LD>
<LD>   But fans who arrive at the Orange County Performing Arts Center
prepared to see the Joe Mantello-directed production that entranced
San Francisco, selling a record 1,000 tickets a day at one point, are
going to be surprised.</LD>
<TE>   They will see several stars from the San Francisco cast--Kristin
Jepson (alternating with Theodora Hanslowe) as Prejean, John Packard
as the death row murderer Joseph DeRocher and Frederica von Stade as
his mother--but Opera Pacific and six other "Dead Man Walking" tour
stops will feature a brand-new production of the opera.</TE>
<TE>   "There were so many companies right after the premiere that wanted
to do the piece," Heggie said. Some, including Houston Grand Opera
and Opera Australia, will present the original production.</TE>
<TE>   "But a lot of them have smaller stages and lack the facilities
that the War Memorial Opera House [in San Francisco] has," Heggie
said. "Opera Pacific called them and said, 'What if we work together
and create a production that would be easier to tour and cost less?'
If they hadn't been able to get together, they probably wouldn't have
been able to do this piece."</TE>
<TE>   Opera Pacific took the lead on the new production because it was
first to commit to showing the new opera, even before it premiered.</TE>
<TE>   "None of the artistic directorial team who created the San
Francisco production were available," said Opera Pacific artistic
director John DeMain, so he turned to director Leonard Foglia and
Foglia's longtime set design collaborator, Michael McGarty, who
created the 1996 Tony Award-winning Broadway production of Terrence
McNally's "Master Class."</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't see the San Francisco Opera production and I didn't want
to," Foglia said during a recent break in rehearsals. "I didn't want
to be influenced. I saw the movie, whenever it came out, and didn't
remember much of it. Then after all our decisions were made, I
watched it again. The movie is wildly different. It's real. We
weren't even close. That was good. It's so far from it, anyone who
looks at it will realize it's not a representational thing."</TE>
<TE>   It could not be representational, Foglia felt, because "right off
the bat, there's a 13-minute scene in which [Prejean] is alone in a
car, singing.</TE>
<TE>   "Singing is an elevated form of art. But how do we elevate the
scene? That became the issue in dealing with the entire opera. How to
elevate it and give it size?</TE>
<TE>   "That journey is the core of the opera: her journey to Christ, her
journey to this man, to a calling she never expected that will
ultimately change her life. My challenge was how to convey what's
going on in her mind. The only thing to do was to eliminate any sort
of representational aspect of a car. Once you take it away, you're
free. If I had to see steering wheels on stage, I'd kill myself."</TE>
<TE>   Foglia and McGarty spent several months just listening to the
opera to get the right images. "All of a sudden, you feel you crack
it. You're hit with a shape or an image or, in this case, towers and
bridges, and you live with it for a while and if it still makes sense
a month later, you stick with it."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of the large-scale, tiered set pieces that were moved on
and off the large San Francisco Opera stage, "there are these four
tower units and two bridges on a raked stage," Heggie said. "It's
quite spectacular, brassy in color and very industrial looking. Joe's
set was gray, black and blue. Both directors made definite choices
based on their interpretation of the music and tell the story
clearly."</TE>
<TE>   To accommodate the various theaters this production will go to,
Foglia and his partner had to create a core--the raked deck, the
towers and bridges-- "that does not change. Our little platform stays
consistent. The theater space will change around it.</TE>
<TE>   "In general, I try to come up with something that's a little
abstract, more of a feeling. Walls aren't my favorite things on
stage. If I walk into a theater and see three walls and a sofa facing
out--I want to kill myself. We go to the theater for more than that."</TE>
<TE>   But form follows function, he says. "No matter what I'm
doing--play, musical or film--my job is storytelling, to make sure
the story is told clearly. You're taking people on the journey."</TE>
<TE>   Opera, in his view, adds some constraints. "Dead Man Walking" is
the first one he's directed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's already been decided what the emotional arc of the scene is
by the music," Foglia says. "It's already been decided by the
composer how a line is read, even to the point of whether it's loud
or soft. The line of the music has already dictated the emotion. All
that doesn't exist in a play. You just have words on a page, which
can be played so many ways. I don't have that kind of leeway here.</TE>
<TE>   "So that's the road map. But I didn't feel stifled by that. I just
accepted it. I took the point of inspiration from the music anyway.
I'm actually having a ball."</TE>
<TE>   Heggie is delighted by both productions. "I think Lenny's response
to the score is extraordinary," he said. "Joe Mantello's [original
production] was extraordinary, too, but different. Two very
different, elaborate productions created within a relatively short
period of time. I'm over the moon."</TE>

<LD>Naturalist Alastair Fothergill set up his hammock deep in the jungle,
lay down clumsily and promptly fell to the ground. He had to laugh:
If the local chimpanzees were watching from the trees above, he
imagined they'd be unimpressed by evolution.</LD>
<LD>   Some viewers might have a similar reaction to Animal Planet's
special "Going Ape," tonight at 8, in which Fothergill and his
partner test their survival skills for several days while tracking
and observing a group of chimps in the Thai Forest of West Africa.
The chimps are much more impressive and interesting than the humans,
and while "Going Ape" is engaging and enlightening enough, it might
have worked even better as a plain nature show without its "Survivor"
and "Fear Factor" trappings.</LD>
<LD>   Fothergill, producer of Discovery Channel's "Blue Planet" series,
and conservationist Saba Douglas-Hamilton eat, sleep and live more or
less like the chimps, with few creature comforts beyond mosquito
nets. Food and water are elusive without the skills lost to
evolution. Keeping up with the chimps, who zip through the dense, hot
jungle, also tests their mettle.</LD>
<TE>   The humans complain of hunger, fatigue and dehydration,
fantasizing about devouring a full English breakfast instead of big
ants that sting your tongue if you don't swallow fast enough. The
show plays up the hazards the humans face, but this feels like
unscripted TV-style danger--more discomforting than anything else.
When the pair lose their way at one point, it turns out they have a
savvy local guide at their disposal.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its gimmicks, at its core "Going Ape" tells the story of a
fascinating, smart species, our closest cousin. And when it gets
close enough to the chimps to explore their hunting, grooming and
communication rituals, it tells it well.</TE>

<HD>Quit Stealing From the Small Screen or Pow! Right in the
Kisser</HD>
<DH>Movies* Studios continue to try to improve on television--
even the classics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WERTS</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The movies are messing with TV again. To paraphrase a classic
big-screen mocking of its small sibling, we're mad as blazes and
we're not going to take it anymore!</LD>
<LD>   If it sometimes seems that Paddy Chayefsky's "Network" vision of
an anything-for-ratings medium has come true--think "Celebrity
Boxing"--it's equally clear that television today can more than equal
motion pictures in depth, creativity and original ideas. It wasn't TV
that foisted "Sorority Boys" upon us.</LD>
<LD>   Weird proof of the tube's repute splashed across Newsday's pages
recently in two ways. First came the three-star review of Film
Forum's opening of "Shot in the Heart," dramatizing the last days of
1970s killer Gary Gilmore in "a film that explores an oft-exploited
case with exquisite understanding and care."</LD>
<TE>   Certainly true. But hardly news to viewers of HBO, which produced
the film and premiered it in October. Surely that's mentioned in the
"movie" review. Uh, no. Funny thing: It doesn't come up either in the
previous month's critique of "How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog," a
dark Kenneth Branagh comedy that, reviewers raved, gave him "the
juiciest leading role he's had in a movie outside of his Shakespeare
adaptations." You could have caught it "at select theaters" in
February. Or on TV when it premiered on cable's Starz channel last
fall.</TE>
<TE>   Movie folks love to dis the tube. They belittle it or ignore it.
Then they steal from it. The same week the big screen claimed "Shot
in the Heart" as its own, Newsday reported, "Paramount Pictures wants
to bring back 'The Honeymooners' as a movie--a contemporary movie at
that."</TE>
<TE>   How many ways is this brilliant notion insane? Let us count. Who
can possibly match Jackie Gleason and Audrey Meadows, not to mention
Art Carney? How will they re-create the Kramdens' Bensonhurst walk-up
in all its 1950s black-and-white sparseness? And then there's the
series' touching simplicity of plot and complexity of emotion. But
here's the true terror. Producer David Friendly was quoted as saying,
"You can certainly expect to hear the term 'bang-zoom' a few times,
and using the phrases and gestures and other staples of the show is
critical."</TE>
<TE>   Bang-zoom to you, dude! What makes the movie folks think they can
"improve" on TV? And the best of TV, at that. They can't even get
"Lost in Space" or "Leave It to Beaver" right.</TE>
<TE>   Every now and then, they'll catch a show's essential flavor
without aping its every move, as in "The Fugitive" or our all-time
TV-to-film fave, "The Brady Bunch Movie," which recognized its source
material's absurd charm and reinvented it by sending it up.</TE>
<TE>   That happens so seldom, though. More often we're left with the
kind of mess that Showtime unfortunately aired again recently. "Car
54, Where Are You?" and "The Honeymooners" had a black-and-white
innocence, though "Car 54's" batty Bronx cops were more whimsical.</TE>
<TE>   None of this comes through in the 1991 film "comedy" starring
David Johansen as simple-minded Gunther Toody, with "Scrubs" head
case John C. McGinley miscast as his strait-laced partner, Francis
Muldoon.</TE>
<TE>   In place of TV's picayune perpetrators and silly talking parrots,
the ungainly gargoyle of a movie employs hookers, mobsters and gross
behavior. When Muldoon visits the Toody home for dinner, Johansen is
pawing tacky wife Rosie O'Donnell in the kitchen. "This dress really
gives me the horn," he drools. "How about a quickie?"</TE>
<TE>   How about leaving the tube alone? And giving it credit where
credit is due? TV might do the same for films. Most series based on
movies are messes, too, with "MASH" the exception that proves the
rule. Big screen and small stand tallest when they show respect for
each other's accomplishments. We won't mention "Charlie's Angels" if
they don't.</TE>

<HD>Continental Is First Carrier to Post Loss</HD>
<DH>Airlines: The company loses $166 million in the quarter.
Poor results are expected industrywide, except at Southwest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Continental Airlines said Monday that it lost $166 million in the
first quarter as passenger traffic and revenue stayed well below
year-ago levels, setting the table for an airline industry expected
to report $2 billion in losses this week.</LD>
<LD>   The carriers, having lost a stunning $7 billion last year because
of the recession and the Sept. 11 attacks, are struggling to claw
their way back.</LD>
<LD>   Factors conspiring against a quick recovery include continued
weakness in the economy, fewer leisure and business travelers, higher
fuel prices, increased security and insurance costs, the airlines'
inability to raise fares and, in some cases, rising labor expenses.</LD>
<TE>   It's a "most difficult of economic environments," said
Continental's chief financial officer, Jeff Misner. Plus, the first
quarter is typically weak for carriers because it includes the winter
months when travel tapers off.</TE>
<TE>   Only one major airline, perennial moneymaker Southwest Airlines
Co., will report a profit for the three months ended March 31 because
the discount airline's operating costs remain among the lowest in the
business, predicted analyst Brian Harris of Salomon Smith Barney.
United parent UAL Corp. and Delta Air Lines Inc. are expected to post
some of the industry's biggest losses.</TE>
<TE>   The airlines' results should slowly improve as the year goes on,
assuming the economy continues its recovery and there isn't another
major event that jolts the system. Continental, Southwest, Alaska
Airlines and AirTran are expected to be back in the black when the
current quarter ends, Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   But in a conference call Monday, Continental Chairman Gordon
Bethune said he doesn't "have a lot of hope" the airline will make
money in the second quarter because of rising fuel costs and low
fares. And "in general, we expect airline management to guide
second-quarter estimates downward," said James Higgins, an analyst at
Credit Suisse First Boston.</TE>
<TE>   In the first quarter, Continental had its first profitable
month--March--since Sept. 11, but it still ended with a loss of $166
million, or $2.61 per diluted share, which included an $83-million
pre-tax charge related to the retirement of its DC-10 fleet.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding the charge, Houston-based Continental lost $114 million,
or $1.79 a share, which was considerably better than the $1.97 a
share it was forecast to lose by analysts surveyed by Thomson
Financial/First Call. A year earlier, the nation's fifth-largest
airline earned $9 million, or 16 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Continental's first-quarter revenue tumbled 19% to $1.99 billion
from $2.45 billion, and the airline said revenue per available seat
mile--a key gauge of how much income it's generating per
passenger--fell 9% to 9.64 cents from 10.6 cents.</TE>
<TE>   The airline industry, after slashing its operations by 20% or more
in response to Sept. 11, secured $5billion in federal bailout cash
and then began gradually adding back service.</TE>
<TE>   The industry also kept jetliners relatively full by offering fare
sales. But the cheap seats aren't helping the airlines' bottom lines
much, and carriers still need more passengers paying higher prices.</TE>
<TE>   But the latest effort by Continental and others to raise leisure
fares fell apart Monday as Northwest Airlines Corp. and a few other
carriers refused to match Continental's plan to hike discounted
round-trip tickets by $20. Some industry executives and analysts say
higher prices won't stick until the U.S. economy becomes stronger,
sparking more demand for travel.</TE>
<TE>   The fare hike's demise prompted a sell-off of airline shares
Monday. Continental's shares tumbled $1.19 to $28.82 on the New York
Stock Exchange, and the American Stock Exchange's index of major
airline stocks fell 2.6% to 101.29 points.</TE>

<HD>Justice Dept., Andersen Close to Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Justice Department and accounting firm Andersen hope to announce
a settlement of the company's criminal indictment by Wednesday, but
no deal has been reached, a source familiar with the matter said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The two sides are negotiating an agreement in which the firm would
acknowledge wrongdoing by certain employees in the shredding of
documents related to Enron Corp. Andersen would be put on probation
for as long as three years, during which it would have to implement
companywide reforms and refrain from further infractions.</LD>
<LD>   In exchange, the government would defer prosecution of its
obstruction-of-justice charge, with the charge eventually being
dismissed if Andersen satisfied the conditions of the deal. Andersen
views a dismissal of the charge as key to its survival.</LD>
<TE>   As part of the agreement, Andersen would cooperate in the
government's investigation into possible wrongdoing at Enron that led
to its bankruptcy protection filing.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has sought a settlement since last week, when David B.
Duncan, its top Enron auditor, pleaded guilty to a similar
obstruction-of-justice charge. Duncan's plea weakened Andersen's
possible legal defense in a trial scheduled for May 6, legal experts
have said.</TE>

<HD>Making More Room for Families</HD>
<DH>Housing: Nonprofit developers are building the larger
apartments sought by low-income tenants, but not enough to meet the
demand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Apartment hunters scouring the city can find options ranging from
palatial penthouses to spartan singles. But those searching for a
simple three-bedroom unit will probably end up empty-handed.</LD>
<LD>   The scarcity of larger units is problematic in big urban centers
such as Los Angeles, where large numbers of low-income and immigrant
families squeeze into small one-bedroom and studio units, housing
specialists said.</LD>
<LD>   Nonprofit housing developers have taken on the job of building
large family-style apartments but in numbers that fall far short of
demand.</LD>
<TE>   "[Renters] will take anything they can get," said Alice Salinas,
housing director for Esperanza Community Housing Corp., a nonprofit
developer that owns about 100 three- and four-bedroom apartments
south of downtown Los Angeles. "We build [larger units] because there
is a great need."</TE>
<TE>   Despite strong demand in urban areas, the three-bedroom apartment
remains one of the rarest forms of real estate. Only about 7% of the
nation's nearly 16 million apartments have three or more bedrooms,
according to the National Multi Housing Council.</TE>
<TE>   Private builders steer away from three-bedroom apartments, which
are viewed as more risky and less profitable than smaller units,
investors and developers said. At least 75% of apartment dwellers are
singles or couples, with few demanding anything larger than a
two-bedroom unit.</TE>
<TE>   However, the statistics do not reveal the large number of renters
who need but cannot afford or find a three-bedroom unit and
consequently settle for smaller units, housing specialists said.</TE>
<TE>   Couples with growing incomes and families tend to leave apartments
for single-family houses and condominiums, said David Cardwell, vice
president of finance and technology at the housing council.</TE>
<TE>   "If my income is not suppressed and I have a large family, I'm
going to rent a house."</TE>
<TE>   Private Developers Prefer Smaller Units</TE>
<TE>   The economics of three-bedroom apartments don't make sense for
many private developers. In most cases, a landlord can't charge much
more for a three-bedroom apartment than a two-bedroom unit despite
the additional cost and space requirements. If a landlord can command
$1,500 for a three- bedroom unit, he can easily get $1,700 or more
combined by renting out a two-bedroom and one-bedroom unit in the
same building, according to apartment industry specialists.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't get the rent per square foot [in a three-bedroom
apartment] that you can for the smaller units," said Dean Zander, an
apartment investment broker at Hendricks &amp; Partners.</TE>
<TE>   In dense urban areas, high land costs drive developers to squeeze
more and smaller apartments into a project, said Fred Tuomi, vice
president of Equity Residential Properties Trust, one of the nation's
largest owners of apartment buildings. Less than 5% of the 21,440
apartments Equity Residential owns in California are three-bedroom
units.</TE>
<TE>   "Our bread-and-butter floor plan is the two-bedroom and two-bath
unit because it's easier to rent," Tuomi said. "If you are building
apartment communities in downtown Los Angeles or Hollywood, you are
going to see very few three-bedrooms."</TE>
<TE>   But the economics and rules of thumb that guide private developers
often are at odds with realities facing the large number of
low-income and immigrant families crowded into urban areas.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of new and renovated apartments that have sprung up
across Los Angeles feature units that are too expensive and small for
large low-income families. Instead of moving to a three-bedroom
house, many residents are forced to remain in crowded apartments
because soaring real estate values have put homeownership out of
reach, advocates of affordable housing said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to happen for a lot of people because of the
economic leap people have to make to afford a home in the Los Angeles
area," said Louis Bernardi, executive director of Los Angeles Housing
Partnership, a nonprofit housing developer.</TE>
<TE>   High prices and a housing shortage have resulted in overcrowding
in about 30% of Los Angeles' housing stock, according to a March 2000
report on the city's housing conditions. Overcrowding is generally
defined as an apartment unit or house with more than one occupant for
every room.</TE>
<TE>   With private developers unable to build large apartments
profitably, nonprofits such as Bernardi's are building the majority
of the three-bedroom apartments, industry observers said. In many
cases, government housing subsidies and tax-credit programs encourage
the development of large three- and four-bedroom apartments. Most
limit the number of residents in each apartment to about two people
for each bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way to develop three- and four-bedroom units is with
subsidies," said Alice Salinas, housing director for Esperanza
Community Housing Corp., which owns about 100 such apartment units in
the crowded neighborhood north of USC. "Without them, families will
not get homes."</TE>
<TE>   Fewer Large Rentals Expected in Future</TE>
<TE>   Nonprofits often are swamped with applications when family-style
apartments come on the market. When Bernardi's organization converted
the historic Bryson Apartments on Wilshire Boulevard into affordable
housing two years ago, about 400 families applied for the 24
three-bedroom units.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with cramped one-bedroom apartments and studios, the
subsidized three-bedroom units at the Bryson and other
affordable-housing projects seem huge to many of their residents.</TE>
<TE>   On Estrella Avenue south of downtown Los Angeles, German and
Teresa Cruz and their three children moved into a three-bedroom
apartment owned by Esperanza Community Housing after spending years
in a one-bedroom rental. The family pays a monthly rent of $525, far
below the $800 to $1,200 being charged for three-bedroom units in the
private market, said German Cruz, 36, who works as a property manager
for Esperanza Community Housing.</TE>
<TE>   "We could never have afforded to pay that," Cruz said.</TE>
<TE>   Families such as the Cruzes will face an even tougher time finding
affordable three-bedroom units in the years to come, as the rising
cost and shrinking supply of urban property make it more costly to
expand the number of family-style apartments, observers said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the urban environment , you are going to see less
three-bedrooms," Tuomi at Equity Residential said.</TE>

<HD>Bank of America Profit Rises 17%, Tops Forecast</HD>
<DH>Financial services: Strong first-quarter results expected
for sector, but Citigroup earnings miss estimates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Setting the stage for an expected strong quarter of bank earnings,
Bank of America Corp. on Monday beat analysts' estimates and posted
its best quarterly profit ever, as commercial-loan problems were less
worrisome than feared and consumer business--especially
mortgages--surged.</LD>
<LD>   Citigroup Inc., the largest U.S. financial company, also reported
higher profit but missed analysts' expectations for the first
quarter. That shortfall, along with worries over interest rates, the
robustness of U.S. economic growth and instability in the Mideast and
Latin America, dragged financial services stocks lower Monday amid a
general market retreat.</LD>
<LD>   Banking companies will post a flood of earnings this week, with
Wells Fargo &amp; Co., City National Corp. and the thrift Washington
Mutual Inc. set to report today. Despite the recession, bank profits
have been setting records.</LD>
<TE>   The results reflect a tug-of-war between commercial lending, which
has deteriorated, and consumer business, which has held up overall
despite high bankruptcies and credit-card delinquencies. The Federal
Reserve Board's slashing of interest rates has been a major boon,
allowing banks to cut interest rates on deposits while originating
record numbers of mortgages.</TE>
<TE>   "The consumer has remained very strong, and that has helped the
economy, which helps banks because their earnings are reflections of
the economy," said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Ronald I. Mandle.</TE>
<TE>   At Bank of America, the nation's largest retail bank,
first-quarter revenue rose 2% to $8.69 billion. Profit was $2.18
billion, or $1.38 a share, up 17% from $1.87 billion, or $1.15, a
year earlier. The consensus of analysts had been $1.34 a share,
according to a Thomson Financial/First Call survey. However, bank
officials gave a cautious outlook because of the uncertain nature of
the U.S. economic recovery. B of A shares fell 85 cents to $69.20 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup reported profit of $4.84billion, or 93 cents a share, on
revenue of $22 billion--a profit increase of 37% from $3.86 billion,
or 69 cents a share, on revenue of $21billion a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   But excluding a $1.06-billion gain on the sale of a stake in
Travelers Property Casualty Corp., Citigroup's per-share earnings
were 74 cents instead of the 78 cents analysts had expected, largely
because of a larger-than-expected pretax charge of $816 million for
losses in Argentina. Its shares fell $1.18 to $45.92 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, U.S. commercial banks earned a record $73.4 billion and
shrugged off recession, Argentina's collapse and the Enron Corp.
debacle in the most profitable fourth quarter ever.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing these banks are still producing this high a level of
earnings," said Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. analyst David B. Hilder. He noted
that Bank of America cut expenses more than expected, had lower loan
losses than expected and saw mortgage income rise 59%.</TE>
<TE>   Profits at companies in the Dow Jones banking index are expected
to rise by 9% this quarter and by 26% for the year, according to
earnings tracker First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts believe commercial lending will pick up this year as
businesses rebuild inventory, helping make up for a decline in
mortgage business after a record $2 trillion in originations last
year.</TE>
<TE>   One leading California sector has been banks catering to Asian
customers, such as East West Bancorp Inc. in San Marino, whose report
of record earnings last week boosted its stock from $30.20 a share
last Wednesday to $35.05 on Monday in Nasdaq trading.</TE>
<TE>   Wilshire State Bank in L.A.'s Koreatown on Monday reported a 23%
increase in net income, to $1.9million, or 61 cents a share, sending
its stock up $3.30, or 17%, to $23 on Nasdaq. And Cathay Bancorp Inc.
in L.A.'s Chinatown rose $2.40 to $76.90 on Nasdaq on Monday after
its profit rose 21% to $11.4million, or 63 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, Irvine-based Westcorp, whose subsidiaries include WFS
Financial Inc. and Western Financial Bank, reported first-quarter net
income of $16.9million, or 46 cents, compared with $17.7million, or
55 cents, a year earlier. Westcorp shares fell 74cents to $23 on the
NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Spitzer Ready to Make Deal With Merrill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>New York state Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer said that he is willing to
try to negotiate a settlement with brokerage Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. over
the conduct of the firm's stock analysts in recent years, and that
splitting off research as a separate unit isn't necessarily a
condition for a deal.</LD>
<LD>   Spitzer's office last week filed an affidavit in state court
alleging that Merrill's Internet stock analysts in 2000 and 2001
routinely touted stocks to the public even while privately
disparaging them. The analysts were trying to curry favor with the
firms in the hope of landing lucrative investment-banking business,
the report alleges.</LD>
<LD>   The probe of Merrill is the initial salvo in a broader
investigation of Wall Street practices, Spitzer said. Even so, his
office "would like to resolve the matter through negotiations," said
Juanita Scarlett, a Spitzer spokeswoman.</LD>
<TE>   Spitzer on Monday said he would no longer demand that Merrill
split off investment research as a separate entity. But sources say
Spitzer still wants Merrill to pay a fine and admit wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, are
expected to discuss the case this week, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   A Merrill spokesman declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill shares rose 62 cents to $47.51 on the New York Stock
Exchange on Monday, after tumbling 13% last week.</TE>

<HD>Beacon to Buy Burbank Tower</HD>
<DH>Japanese owners are selling the 32-story high-rise to a
Beacon Capital Partners fund for almost $100 million. Walt Disney Co.
is the main tenant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of Burbank's signature high-rises, the 32-story Tower, is being
sold by its Japanese owners for almost $100 million to a real estate
investment fund managed by Boston-based Beacon Capital Partners.</LD>
<LD>   Beacon is buying the Tower from Tochikogyo USA Inc., an affiliate
of Japanese real estate and construction giant Kumagai Gumi Co.
Escrow is scheduled to close this week. Walt Disney Co. is the main
tenant in the Tower, one of the tallest concrete-framed high-rises in
the West.</LD>
<LD>   A Kumagai Gumi subsidiary developed the building at 3900 W.
Alameda Ave. in 1989 in a venture overseen by local real estate
entrepreneurs Stephen Geiger and Dee Christiansen. Saudi arms dealer
Adnan Khashoggi was the key financial partner in the $85-million
development before the Japanese took over.</LD>
<TE>   The transaction represents the last investment for the Beacon
Capital Strategic Partners I fund, said Jeremy Fletcher, chief
executive of Beacon Capital's Western region. The company's next
fund, Beacon Capital Strategic Partners II, will spend $500 million
or more to buy office properties in select markets, including
California.</TE>
<TE>   "Southern California office markets have actually been holding up
pretty well." Fletcher said. "We've been able to pull the trigger
consistently and still purchase properties for less than replacement
cost."</TE>
<TE>   The Tower's price factors to $215 a square foot. Fletcher
estimated it would cost $275 to $300 a square foot to replicate the
building today. Peter Spies of the Lazard investment banking group
brokered the transaction with Fletcher and Beacon's acquisitions
chief, Wistar Wood. MetLife provided more than $60million in mortgage
financing.</TE>
<TE>   Disney leases 93% of the Tower's 465,000 square feet of office
space in an agreement that runs for six more years and includes
renewal options. The Tower's tenant roster also includes Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter and Charles Schwab &amp; Co. One floor is vacant.</TE>
<TE>   Considering the Media District's popularity with the entertainment
industry and Disney's recent lease renewal, Beacon negotiated "a
great price," said Bill Boyd, a senior vice president at brokerage
Grubb &amp; Ellis Co.</TE>
<TE>   The building's rental income is especially important because
demand for Burbank offices has been sluggish and new competing
developments are nearing completion. For instance, M. David Paul
Development's 425,000-square-foot Pinnacle will open soon across the
Ventura Freeway from the Tower but hasn't formally signed a tenant.
Nor have some other new buildings in Burbank's downtown and airport
districts.</TE>
<TE>   Vacancy in the 4-million-square-foot Burbank office market has
nearly doubled to 13.7% over the last year, and an additional
1.13million square feet of buildings are under construction,
according to Grubb &amp; Ellis. Asking rents at top-quality buildings
average about $31.50 a square foot annually, unchanged from the rate
a year ago.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Immunex Corp. said Genentech Inc. agreed to begin making Enbrel in
2004, helping bolster the supply of Immunex's top-selling treatment
for rheumatoid arthritis.</LD>
<LD>   Manufacturing constraints have limited Enbrel supplies and checked
growth of the drug, which had sales of $762 million last year.
Immunex has a waiting list of about 13,000 patients who want the
drug. It last month notified others already on the drug to expect
delays until June.</LD>
<LD>   Amgen Inc., which is buying Immunex for about $16 billion, has
said it expects to begin producing more Enbrel next year when it
completes a new plant in Rhode Island.</LD>
<TE>   Immunex's agreement with Genentech is intended to ensure adequate
supply of the drug until a second Rhode Island plant begins operating
in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Immunex fell 26 cents to close at $28.92 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>ChevronTexaco CEO Gets Big Boost in Pay</HD>
<DH>Compensation: O'Reilly receives $5.97 million in salary and
bonuses for 2001, more than double what he made in 2000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL LIEDTKE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>ChevronTexaco Corp. more than doubled the paycheck of Chief Executive
David O'Reilly last year, rewarding him with a $3.2-million bonus for
engineering a deal that created the nation's second-largest oil
company and set the stage for 4,500 job cuts.</LD>
<LD>   Besides giving O'Reilly a special bonus for overseeing Chevron's
$39-billion takeover of Texaco, the San Francisco-based company also
paid its chairman and CEO $970,833 in salary and a $1.8-million award
for beating the board's profit goal last year, according to documents
filed Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The $5.97 million in salary and short-term bonuses represented a
hefty raise from the $2.86 million that O'Reilly received in 2000,
his first year as CEO. During 2001, ChevronTexaco said it had
increased O'Reilly's salary 11%, to $1 million from $900,000.</LD>
<TE>   In 2001, ChevronTexaco also paid O'Reilly $1.14 million under a
long-term compensation plan measuring the company's performance
dating back to 1999 and awarded him 150,000 stock options that will
be worth $21.2 million if the company's shares appreciate by 10%
annually during the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   ChevronTexaco handed out a total of $4 million in merger bonuses
to its next four highest-paid executives. Vice Chairman Glenn Tilton
and Vice President John Watson each received $1.5-million merger
bonuses, while Vice Chairman Richard Matzke and Vice President Peter
Robertson each received $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   ChevronTexaco is rewarding its top executives for their work in
the merger amid a cost-cutting spree designed to pare the company's
expenses by $1.8 billion annually. The streamlining will include
4,500 job cuts from a payroll of about 56,000 employees at the time
of the merger's completion.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after O'Reilly took charge in 2000, Chevron launched into
one of the most profitable periods in its history as the company
cashed in on rising oil and gas prices. The run of prosperity ended
in the final quarter of last year when ChevronTexaco posted a
$2.5-billion loss as the company absorbed charges to pay for the
merger and devalued some holdings.</TE>
<TE>   Despite $12.2 billion in operating profit during O'Reilly's first
two years as CEO, ChevronTexaco's stock has remained flat. Chevron
gained $1.20 to close at $85.30 on the New York Stock Exchange. The
shares were worth $86.62 just before O'Reilly became CEO.</TE>

<HD>Cingular, AT&amp;T Wireless in Talks</HD>
<DH>Telecom: A merger would create the nation's largest cell
phone carrier and reshape the industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cingular Wireless and AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc. reportedly are in
merger talks to form what would become the nation's largest
cell-phone carrier and the first deal in a wave of consolidation that
is expected to reshape one of technology's key industries.</LD>
<LD>   Although a deal between the country's No. 2 and No. 3 wireless
service providers does not appear to be imminent, analysts said the
combination is one of several merger scenarios that could develop
this year in wireless.</LD>
<LD>   That's because the rate of growth is slowing markedly, leaving
acquisitions as one of the more viable means for aggressive companies
to get larger and to protect themselves against pricing pressures.</LD>
<TE>   A deal between AT&amp;T Wireless and Cingular would be complex because
Cingular is jointly owned by SBC Communications Inc. and BellSouth
Corp. But the combination would create a national giant, with an
estimated 40 million mobile phone customers in the United States,
dwarfing the 29 million customers at Verizon Wireless, the nation's
largest carrier.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no pretty mergers left in wireless ... but it is a
much-needed thing within the industry," said William Crawford, a
senior analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. "The climate for
wireless carriers is not that good."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Cingular, SBC, BellSouth and AT&amp;T Wireless declined
to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The talks were first reported by Bloomberg News, which said the
smaller AT&amp;T was seeking to acquire Cingular. SBC owns 60% of
Cingular; BellSouth, 40%.</TE>
<TE>   Privately owned Cingular and publicly traded AT&amp;T Wireless make a
good fit because they use the same technologies in their mobile phone
systems, and thus could get better equipment prices and share the
massive cost of network expansions and upgrades, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The deal could especially benefit Cingular, which has been forced
to cut deals with competitors to stitch together nationwide service
coverage for its customers.</TE>
<TE>   The Atlanta-based company has forged partnerships with AT&amp;T
Wireless in some regions and with VoiceStream Wireless in others.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Cingular has had to postpone a planned initial public
offering because of poor market conditions, closing off one potential
source of capital for the company's planned expansions and upgrades.</TE>
<TE>   The entire mobile phone business, once booming with record numbers
of new customers each quarter, has slowed down significantly in the
last six months.</TE>
<TE>   After adding 20 million customers in 2001, the U.S. market is
expected to grow by just 18 million this year and by 15 million
customers in 2003, according to January estimates from Merrill Lynch.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, many industries would love to add customers at that
rate. But for the mobile phone market, the slowdown comes amid
increased competition and expensive network upgrades at all the major
carriers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the stock prices of many of the once-thriving
companies, among them AT&amp;T Wireless, Sprint PCS and Nextel
Communications, have fallen precipitously in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of AT&amp;T Wireless, which have fallen more than 58% in the
last year, rose 7 cents on Monday to close at $8.25, SBC shares
slipped 53 cents to $33.47 and BellSouth fell 8 cents to $32, all on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   'Too Much Competition' Seen in Industry</TE>
<TE>   Shares of other wireless companies not involved in the deal were
mixed. Sprint PCS gained 6 cents to $10.02 on the NYSE and Nextel
rose 9 cents to $4.47 on Nasdaq. But Verizon fell 96 cents to $41.38
on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting to the point where there [may be] too much
competition," said Ray Jodoin, principal wireless analyst at
In-Stat/MDR in Scottsdale, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   "In Phoenix, we now have eight wireless carriers for 3.25 million
people.... That doesn't make sense, and there are no financial
winners."</TE>
<TE>   Another force driving consolidation is the industry's push to
gather enough radio spectrum to accommodate future growth and to
carry airwave-hogging services such as picture messaging and mobile
Internet access.</TE>
<TE>   Some companies maintain they have enough spectrum for several
years, but others are looking to add to their holdings, especially in
densely packed cities such as New York.</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulators cleared the way for such wheeling and dealing
by agreeing to eliminate next year the current limits on how much
spectrum a company can own in each city.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of companies talking to each right now, but
nothing big would happen until in 2003, when the spectrum cap gets
lifted," said Rashad Barajakly of Williams Capital. "Sooner or later,
[consolidation] is going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   To win government approvals for big mergers, carriers will have to
prove that prices will not go up with fewer players in the market.</TE>
<TE>   "If all you're trying to do is get together so that you can
stabilize or increase pricing, forget it," said John Maxwell, an
analyst at Waddell &amp; Reed Financial Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Approval will be easier if the companies can "come up with some
kind of a case that says we need this spectrum to be technologically
competitive," Maxwell said.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T Wireless became a tracking stock of parent AT&amp;T Corp. in
early 2000, and later became an independent company. It is 16% owned
by NTT DoCoMo, the fast-growing wireless unit of Japan's NTT phone
company.</TE>
<TE>   Cingular was created as a joint venture in early 2000, when SBC
and BellSouth agreed to combine their wireless properties--11 brands
in all--including the former Pacific Bell Wireless in California.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said either AT&amp;T Wireless or Cingular also could be
pursuing a deal with VoiceStream Wireless, a growing carrier that is
technologically compatible with both players.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, analysts said another deal could emerge from a group
of carriers that use compatible technologies: Verizon Wireless,
Alltell and Sprint PCS. Nextel, which uses a technology not shared by
other carriers, also could be a target despite potential network
difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking at it realistically, they are all for sale," In-Stat's
Jodoin said.</TE>

<LD>In what is believed to be the largest office lease agreement in
Orange County in two years, the Syndicated Office Systems subsidiary
of Tenet Healthcare Corp. signed a 10-year, $40-million lease for
150,000 square feet at Trammell Crow Co.'s Arena Corporate Center
next to the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim. Syndicated Office will move
its headquarters from Santa Ana in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   The 383,250-square-foot Arena Corporate Center is expected to be
completed in late 2002, said John Harty of Trammell Crow. Trammell
Crow is developing the center on behalf of Riggs Bank as trustee for
the Multi Employer Property Trust and Kennedy Associates Real Estate
Counsel.</LD>
<LD>   Harty represented Arena Corporate Center in lease negotiations,
along with Liz Hurley and Craig De Miranda, also of Trammell Crow.
The tenant was represented by Mark Friend of CB Richard Ellis.</LD>

firm, which ranks as one of the nation's largest general contractors,
with annual revenue exceeding $1.2 billion. The value of the sale was
not revealed. The firm was founded in 1864.</LD>
<LD>   When the deal is completed, the St. Louis-based firm will be

<HD>J.P. Morgan Pressed on Enron Loan Data</HD>
<DH>Probe: Bank is asked for details about transactions that
may have helped hide debt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rep. Henry A. Waxman on Monday asked J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. to
explain its role in a series of loans to Enron Corp. partnerships
that may have helped keep debt off the energy trader's books.</LD>
<LD>   Waxman, a Los Angeles Democrat, asked J.P. Morgan to provide
details about loans between an Enron unit called Sequoia Financial
Assets and several Enron partnerships. Waxman is concerned that the
transactions allowed Sequoia to avoid recording debt.</LD>
<LD>   Waxman is asking whether J.P. Morgan designed the transactions to
help Enron improve the financial picture it presented to Wall Street.</LD>
<TE>   Transactions involving the Sequoia partnership "do not appear to
have served a legitimate economic purpose," Waxman wrote to William
B. Harrison Jr., J.P. Morgan's chief executive. "Rather, on their
face, they appear to have been designed to allow Enron to covertly
borrow hundreds of millions of dollars in undisclosed loans."</TE>
<TE>   Congress is stepping up its investigation into the role investment
banks played in Enron's bankruptcy filing. The House Energy and
Commerce Committee, on which Waxman serves, sent letters last month
to J.P. Morgan and eight other banks requesting information,
including whether Enron pressured them to make investments.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan and the other banks also are facing shareholder
lawsuits that contend that the banks made billions in fees for
helping to set up Enron partnerships that were little more than
"Ponzi schemes" that helped inflate the company's stock price.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan has filed its own lawsuit that seeks to force Enron to
release more than $2.1 billion it is allegedly holding on the bank's
behalf. Waxman indicated that court filings by J.P. Morgan in that
case are raising a new line of inquiry for investigators looking at
five partnerships: Sequoia, Choctaw, Cherokee, Zephyrus and Enron
Finance Partners.</TE>

<HD>GE's Lending Unit to Cut 7,000 Jobs</HD>
<DH>Financing: Move comes as Capital Services group struggles
to grow in face of weak U.S. economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Electric Co.'s huge financing arm said Monday that it is
eliminating 7,000 jobs and otherwise slashing costs by $1 billion
this year, raising more questions about the unit's stalled growth and
the potential effect on GE's overall performance.</LD>
<LD>   The job cuts, which equal 8% of the 90,000-person global work
force of GE Capital Services, were disclosed by the division's chief
financial officer, James Parke, during a meeting with bond analysts
in New York. GE said the cuts were the latest reductions in its
long-term program to lower costs and boost productivity.</LD>
<LD>   But they also come as GE Capital is struggling to grow in the face
of the weak U.S. economy, which has affected most of GE's major
businesses. Indeed, GE last week said its overall first-quarter
revenue was flat compared with a year earlier, which sparked a
sell-off of GE's stock.</LD>
<TE>   GE Capital generates more than 40% of the revenue and profit for
the conglomerate, providing financing for a broad range of
industries, from automobiles to aircraft. It offers credit cards,
makes home mortgages and finances heavy equipment. The unit is based
in Stamford, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   GE Capital is a key reason GE repeatedly enjoyed annual
double-digit growth and its stock was a market bellwether for nearly
two decades. But the stock tumbled $1.70, or 5%, to $31.85 a share
Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. GE--a component of the Dow
Jones industrial average and the stock market's most prized company
with a total market value of $313 billion--has now fallen 19% since
March 1. Less than two years ago, the stock hit $60.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the Enron Corp.and Andersen scandals, the
growth records of GE and GE Capital also are coming under sharp
scrutiny. Although no one has suggested any wrongdoing, skeptics are
wondering aloud how much GE and GE Capital might have relied on legal
accounting moves, acquisitions and other "financial engineering" to
help keep the growth rate intact, and whether GE is carrying too much
debt as a result.</TE>
<TE>   GE, with 330,000 employees overall, also makes appliances,
lighting fixtures, medical equipment, plastics and aircraft engines,
and it owns the NBC television network. Its strongest division at the
moment is its power systems group, which makes turbines for the
energy industry. The company's revenue last year was $126billion.</TE>
<TE>   GE also has come under fire over the level of disclosure of
financial information, and the Fairfield, Conn.-based concern is now
making more data available to the public. "We acknowledge our
responsibility to ensure transparency for our investors," Richard
Wacker, an investor relations vice president at GE, said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   But the added information is spawning added questions. Referring
to GE Capital's job cuts, analyst Robert Friedman of Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. said, "That doesn't sound like a growth operation to me.
You can't cut your way to earnings growth indefinitely."</TE>
<TE>   Friedman, who's frequently bearish toward GE, also said GE
Capital's current struggle could indicate that its sustained growth
in the 1990s reflected the U.S. economy's growth, "as opposed to
business and management acumen" at GE, more than previously thought.</TE>
<TE>   But massive job cuts and efficiency efforts are nothing new at GE,
and in fact were a staple during the long run of Chief Executive John
F. "Jack" Welch Jr. Under new CEO Jeffrey Immelt, this year's
reductions at GE Capital also are part of "ongoing productivity
reductions," in which the company replaces people with computers and
other new technology where possible, and "doesn't represent any shift
or change in direction for us," said GE Capital spokesman John
Oliver.</TE>
<TE>   "We're putting more people in front offices who deal with
customers, and consolidating back offices where you can have
efficiencies through technology," Oliver said.</TE>
<TE>   In this year's first quarter, GE Capital's revenue fell 6% from a
year earlier, to $11.8 billion, but its profit rose 19%, to $1.7
billion--before charges related to a mandatory accounting change and
other one-time items.</TE>
<TE>   GE's overall earnings before the charges rose 17% to $3.5 billion,
but with the charges its profit fell 3%--the first quarterly drop in
net income for GE in seven years.</TE>

<HD>Asia Global Crossing Delays Interest Payment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Asia Global Crossing on Monday delayed for up to 30 days an interest
payment on $408 million of senior notes so it can continue
negotiations with bondholders about restructuring its high-yield
debt.</LD>
<LD>   The Bermuda-based high-speed communications network operator said
it has about $351 million in cash, sufficient to fund its daily
operations and pay the interest due on the 13.375% senior notes due
2010 by the end of the 30-day grace period if no agreement is
reached.</LD>
<LD>   However, the company has been looking to reduce expenses and raise
additional funds since its parent, Global Crossing Ltd., refused a
$400-million loan request under a credit facility last December.</LD>
<TE>   Delaying the interest payment also allows Asia Global Crossing to
continue negotiating with potential equity investors, the company
said.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Global Crossing, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in January, said it's protesting a decision by the Defense
Department to rescind a contract worth as much as $450 million. The
three-year research and engineering agreement, awarded in July,
hadn't been initiated.</TE>
<TE>   After unsuccessful bidders contested the results, the contract was
put out for a second round of bids. WorldCom Inc. said in an April 4
statement it won the contract.</TE>
<TE>   The Defense Information Systems Agency said Global Crossing was
ineligible because of its "financial situation," Global Crossing
spokeswoman Catherine Berthier said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is our contention that we met all of the stated criteria for
demonstrating financial responsibility, and we therefore should have
been considered for the contract," Global Crossing Chief Executive
John Legere said in a statement.</TE>

<HD>Big Investors Target Firms' Accountability</HD>
<DH>Governance: Group led by Vanguard founder plans to push for
changes to protect shareholders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of institutional investors led by Vanguard Group founder Jack
Bogle met Monday in New York to launch a campaign aimed at boosting
corporate managers' accountability to shareholders.</LD>
<LD>   The meeting, partly a response to Enron Corp.'s collapse and the
firestorm it fueled over corporate practices and financial
disclosure, included well-known Legg Mason Inc. money manager Bill
Miller, who along with Bogle has been particularly vocal recently in
pushing company executives to better serve the interests of long-term
investors.</LD>
<LD>   Bogle said he and Miller were joined by eight other institutional
investors for a discussion of such issues as the cost of stock option
grants, accounting standards and the independence of corporate boards
of directors.</LD>
<TE>   Bogle said the group reached "a very good consensus about what the
issues are" and agreed to come up with specific proposals over the
next two months.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting was significant because many mutual fund companies and
other institutional investors have long been reluctant to get
involved in public campaigns on controversial corporate governance
issues.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Bogle declined to name the other eight investment firms
represented at Monday's meeting, saying they prefer, for now, to keep
a low profile.</TE>
<TE>   He called the meeting "a long-overdue first step." Bogle for years
has urged fund managers to use their financial clout to take a more
active role in governance issues. In February he proposed the
creation of an informal committee of buy-and-hold fund managers to
monitor corporate practices and push for change when deemed
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Bogle said that if the group reaches an accord on key issues, it
may announce a set of so-called best practices that company
executives would be encouraged to follow.</TE>
<TE>   The cost to shareholders of hefty executive stock option grants
was a major issue raised at the meeting, according to Bogle and
Miller. Bogle said he would like to see option grants tied to factors
other than share price performance, such as earnings growth relative
to industry competitors, so that managers would concentrate on their
underlying business more than on their stock charts.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, whose Legg Mason Value Trust stock fund holds $11 billion
in assets, said he also would like to see more companies follow the
lead of firms such as Boeing Co. and Winn-Dixie Stores Inc. by
voluntarily reporting the cost of options as an expense on their
income statements. Federal law doesn't require that options be
expensed, though legislation in the U.S. Senate and proposals by
accounting regulators would require expensing those costs.</TE>
<TE>   "It would seem like an easy issue, but unfortunately, there is a
huge and vociferous opposition," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   A concern raised by at least one manager at the meeting, according
to Bogle, was "how the market would react to the earnings hit" that
firms might take if they started expensing options.</TE>
<TE>   Separately on Monday, trustees of the California Public Employees'
Retirement System--one of the most activist of institutional money
managers--debated the issue of stock-option expensing but was unable
to agree whether to support the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of whether the Bogle/Miller group reaches a consensus,
Miller said, he is drafting formal proxy voting standards for the
Legg Mason mutual funds and already is discussing many governance
issues with companies in his portfolios.</TE>

<HD>Hughes' Loss Widens Despite DirectTV Growth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hughes Electronics Corp. reported a wider net loss for the first
quarter Monday, even though it added new U.S. subscribers to its
DirectTV service at a faster clip than expected.</LD>
<LD>   The satellite TV broadcaster, which is a unit of General Motors
Corp., had a net loss of $156.4million for the quarter ended March
31, compared with a loss of $105.3 million, as its costs jumped 22%.
Revenue grew 7.7% to $2.04billion. GM does not provide per share
earnings for Hughes.</LD>
<LD>   Hughes' first-quarter cash flow, or earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization, rose 19% to $134.2 million. The
average cash flow estimate was $116.5 million, with a range of $87.6
million to $132 million, as compiled by research firm Multex.</LD>
<TE>   DirecTV U.S., responsible for nearly $1.5 billion of Hughes sales,
added 342,000 subscribers in the three months ended March 31,
exceeding forecasts of 325,000.</TE>
<TE>   Although the company said customer turnover had improved, the
average revenue generated from each user slipped 3% to $56.70 because
of lower pay-per-view and premium programming purchases. The average
cost to acquire a customer decreased almost 3% during the quarter to
$520, the firm said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of El Segundo-based Hughes fell 57 cents to $15.60 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Intel to Settle Patent Lawsuit</HD>
<DH>Computers: Chip maker will pay $300 million in long-running
dispute over Intergraph's Clipper technology.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Dow Jones/Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Computer chip giant Intel Corp. agreed to pay $300 million to settle
a long-running lawsuit in Alabama over Intergraph Corp.'s patented
Clipper technology, Intergraph said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Intergraph said it reached an agreement with Intel for the Alabama
case after mediation. The lawsuit pending in federal court in
Birmingham, Ala., will be dismissed, and the firms have signed a
cross-license agreement.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, Intergraph agreed to sell certain unrelated patents
to Intel.</LD>
<TE>   The news sent Intergraph shares down $1.88 to $15.02 on Nasdaq.
Intel shares fell 28 cents to $28.11, also on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Intergraph, a Huntsville, Ala., maker of workstation
computers, sued Intel, alleging infringement of its Clipper patents.
In 2001, Intergraph filed another suit in federal court in Marshall,
Texas, alleging Intel infringed two patents related to parallel
instruction computing.</TE>
<TE>   Intergraph has claimed Intel uses the Clipper technology in its
Pentium family of microprocessors that power personal computers, and
sought royalties from the microchip maker.</TE>
<TE>   The companies' litigation in Texas will go to trial this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Intel also said Monday that it will post about half of its
$300-million payment to Intergraph as a charge to first-quarter
earnings.</TE>
<TE>   A Thomson Financial/First Call survey of 23 analysts yielded a
mean earnings estimate of 15 cents a share for the first quarter,
compared with 16 cents Intel earned a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Clara, Calif., chip maker plans to report first-quarter
earnings today.</TE>

<HD>Interactive TV Gets Its Own Emmy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences on Monday announced a new
Emmy for interactive TV programming, signaling that the long-hyped
but little-seen marriage of technology and TV has finally won a
foothold in the industry.</LD>
<LD>   Chances are good, however, that the winning enhancements won't
have been seen by most TV viewers. That's because relatively few
sets, cable converter boxes or satellite receivers in the U.S. are
delivering that kind of interactivity today.</LD>
<LD>   With that in mind, the academy decided not to reserve an Emmy
statuette for interactive programmers. Instead, the winners--if there
are any--will receive an Emmy plaque.</LD>
<TE>   The award will recognize original interactive enhancements that
are "integrally related" to a program. For example, it might be an
overlay on the TV screen that offers background information on the
characters, or a Web site that offers supplemental text, graphics and
video.</TE>
<TE>   John Leverence, the academy's vice president of awards, said
interactive TV is still a work in progress. The award, he said,
should be viewed as "a first step in the direction of full Emmy
recognition, even as the technology is still in its infancy, still
unfulfilled in terms of its promise."</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of the new Emmy, which will be awarded Aug. 21 during
the engineering awards presentation, said they wanted not only to
recognize the creative work being done in interactive TV but also to
encourage more of it.</TE>
<TE>   "The mission of the television academy [includes] recognizing
leadership in the advancement of television arts and sciences," said
Brian Seth Hurst, a consultant active in the campaign for the award.
"The point is to continue to forward the medium."</TE>
<TE>   Interactive TV has been around in one form or another since the
1950s, when a CBS show, "Winky Dink and You," invited kids to help
solve a cartoon character's problems by drawing on their TV screens.
It has come and gone several times since then, with new technologies
being abandoned in the face of high costs and low interest.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last few years, cable and satellite operators have
installed millions of set-top boxes capable of delivering interactive
TV--if they have the right software.</TE>
<TE>   The TV industry has yet to settle on which software to use,
however, chopping the potential audience into smaller pieces.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Bernoff, a principal analyst with Forrester Research, said
the leading interactive TV services today are interactive ads, news
and weather updates, video on demand and personal video recording,
not program-related enhancements.</TE>
<TE>   Although public TV stations and education-oriented cable networks
have been particularly active experimenters, no one has found a
business model yet to support the kind of interactivity the academy
wants to recognize.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers "are interested in that extra information. They've taken
advantage of it, but from the broadcasters' side, how do we make a
dime off of this?" said analyst Mike Paxton of Cahners In-Stat MDR, a
technology research firm.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Shawn Hardin, a governor of the academy's
Interactive Media Peer Group, said interactive programs are "being
distributed pretty much by every major broadcaster."</TE>
<TE>   For example, CBS offers a stylish version of "CSI" with
interactive explanations of the high-tech forensic tools used on the
show, and ABC's Web site for "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" lets
viewers play along with the on-air contestants.</TE>
<TE>   "Every major outlet that we can look at has one- or two-screen
experiences that qualify for this award and in some cases are
extremely compelling," Hardin said.</TE>
<TE>   A one-screen program lets viewers display the interactive features
on their TV sets, typically by shrinking the video to make room for
extra text and graphics. A two-screen program delivers the
interactive features through the Web, so viewers can display them on
computers near their TVs.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts estimate that 30 million to 40 million people watch TV
and surf the Web simultaneously, and close to 10 million homes have
satellite and cable TV set-top boxes that can deliver basic
interactive programming.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 1 million have more advanced set-tops with two-way
connections to the Internet, enabling more sophisticated
interactivity.</TE>

<HD>Dow Retreats on Citigroup Earnings</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Disappointing first-quarter results, on heels of
GE's report, fuel investors' reluctance to commit to stocks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Disappointing earnings from Citigroup set off more selling on Wall
Street on Monday as investors, still unimpressed by first-quarter
reports, shied away from commitments to stocks.</LD>
<LD>   Trading volume was light, a reflection of investors' unwillingness
to participate until corporate forecasts become less murky. Analysts
said that until companies start to express confidence that business
is improving, a rally will be unlikely.</LD>
<LD>   "So far, earnings have not created a catalyst, there's no dramatic
guidance to think the future's going to be better, and then you have
this overhang in the Middle East," said Larry Wachtel, a market
analyst at Prudential Securities. "No one is emboldened to step up to
the plate in an environment like this."</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 97.15 points, or
nearly 1%, at 10,093.67, while the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index fell 8.46 points, or 0.8%, to 1,102.55. It was the lowest close
since Feb. 22 for both indexes. The tech-focused Nasdaq composite
index slipped 2.41 points, or 0.1%, to 1,753.78.</TE>
<TE>   Losers outnumbered winners by 5 to 4 on the New York Stock
Exchange and by 8 to 7 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Investors had hoped that this week's profit reports, which include
some of the country's biggest and most important companies, would
provide momentum for a flagging market. The message Monday was
definitely mixed.</TE>
<TE>   Dow component Citigroup fell $1.18 to $45.92 after reporting
first-quarter results that fell below Wall Street's expectations
because of losses in its Argentine holdings. Fellow Dow member
General Electric, which reported disappointing profit last week, fell
$1.70 to $31.85 on renewed concerns about its earnings prospects.</TE>
<TE>   However, Eli Lilly met analysts' expectations despite reporting
its third consecutive quarterly earnings decline of more than 20%,
and the drug maker's shares gained $1.78 to $75.20.</TE>
<TE>   Among tech stocks, Intel, which is set to release earnings today,
lost 28 cents to $28.11. The chip maker is considered a bellwether
for the sector, and analysts and investors are waiting to hear what
the company has to say about the future.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Intel's loss, the SOX index of semiconductor stocks rose
2%, reflecting gains by Applied Materials, up 84 cents to $51.44.</TE>
<TE>   After the market closed, Texas Instruments reported first-quarter
results slightly above expectations and expressed optimism that its
business was turning around. The stock rose to $33.05 in after-hours
trading after closing at $32.13, up 33 cents, during the regular
session.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the technology sector's slightly better performance
Monday had more to do with lower prices after heavy selling this year
rather than any stronger prospects for the future. Nasdaq is down
10.1% so far this year, compared with a 0.7% gain in the Dow and a 4%
loss in the S&amp;P during the same time.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Oil-related stocks gained as crude prices rose $1.10 to $24.57 a
barrel in New York trading on expectations that Venezuelan President
Hugo Chavez's return to power will prop up prices. Exxon Mobil
advanced 30 cents to $41.60, and ChevronTexaco gained $1.20 to
$85.30. Driller Baker Hughes rose $1.03 to $34.78.</TE>
<TE>   * Airline stocks faltered after Continental Airlines reported a
first-quarter loss and investors braced for red ink from other
carriers. Continental fell $1.19 to $28.82, and the S&amp;P airlines
index lost 3.9%.</TE>

<HD>An Unexpected Source Gives Microsoft a Lift</HD>
<DH>Technology: Key witness called by states in antitrust trial
says he opposes plan to give rivals rights to MSN Explorer Web
browser.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The chief economics witness for the states in the Microsoft antitrust
trial Monday refused to endorse key portions of their plan to punish
the software giant as the states rested their case on a lackluster
note.</LD>
<LD>   Under cross-examination by Microsoft attorney Michael Lacovara, UC
Berkeley economics professor Carl Shapiro said he didn't endorse a
state proposal that would require Microsoft Corp. to give rivals
rights to the MSN Explorer browser used by subscribers of a Microsoft
Web service that competes with America Online.</LD>
<LD>   He said the disclosure "would be an inappropriate taking of
Microsoft's intellectual property."</LD>
<TE>   Shapiro also said a similar state proposal that would require
Microsoft to publicly disclose the software code for Windows,
Internet Explorer and some other products for 10 years risks slowing
innovation and creating incompatible software.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the experience of Netscape, which began disclosing its
source code in 1998, Lacovara got Shapiro to acknowledge that the
states' remedy was potentially harmful to innovation.</TE>
<TE>   "Some reviewers said that [open source] Navigator was the worst
piece of software that year," Lacovara said.</TE>
<TE>   Shapiro, a onetime Justice Department economist, acknowledged
Netscape's experiment "didn't come out very well."</TE>
<TE>   Although Shapiro did embrace some other state sanctions, his
reservations about several of their key proposals represented the
biggest blow yet to the nine states that refused to go along with the
Justice Department's antitrust settlement with Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me he didn't help the states a whole lot," said
Robert H. Lande, a University of Baltimore law professor who listened
in on Shapiro's testimony Monday and has been sympathetic to the
states' case.</TE>
<TE>   The states' setback was tempered somewhat later in the day, when
the Justice Department filed a brief supporting the right of the
holdout states, led by California and Iowa, to continue their case.</TE>
<TE>   In November, the Justice Department joined nine other states in
reaching an out-of-court settlement with Microsoft and ended their
litigation against the software giant.</TE>
<TE>   But the antitrust dispute lives on in an unusual remedies trial
that began March 18 before U.S. District Judge Colleen
Kollar-Kotelly.</TE>
<TE>   The trial was ordered by a federal appeals court that last year
upheld a lower court ruling that Microsoft violated antitrust laws by
using its flagship Windows software--which runs 90% of all personal
computers--to thwart competition from Netscape Navigator, a rival
Internet Web browser.</TE>
<TE>   The trial, which is expected to last for two months, is being held
to determine what additional punishment, if any, Microsoft should
face.</TE>
<TE>   The states argue that the software giant should face tougher
remedies than have been proposed in the Justice Department settlement
accord.</TE>
<TE>   But Microsoft argues that the states suffered no "state-specific"
antitrust injury and that permitting them to proceed with their
remedies claims runs contrary to the notion of the federal government
as the enforcer of U.S. antitrust law.</TE>
<TE>   In its 32-page brief, however, the Justice Department said Judge
Kollar-Kotelly may "properly inquire" into "whether a small group of
states are the parties best situated to obtain relief of such broad
reach and implication."</TE>

<HD>Airline Boosts Order for Boeing's 717 Jets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Midwest Express Airlines Inc. said Monday that it is buying more
Boeing Co. 717 airplanes than originally planned, providing a morale
boost for the Long Beach-based program that was almost shuttered last
year because of a lack of orders.</LD>
<LD>   The Milwaukee-based airline said it placed firm orders for 25
717s, up from 20 under the initial memorandum of understanding signed
in April 2001, raising the overall value of the deal to $940 million
from $750 million.</LD>
<LD>   The order is the largest single deal for Boeing's smallest
jetliner in three years.</LD>
<TE>   For its part, Midwest Express said it asked Boeing to accelerate
delivery of the 717s from one every other month under the original
terms to one every month, mainly so it can retire its aging DC-9
fleet more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Deliveries of the 88-passenger planes will begin in February 2003
and continue into 2005.</TE>
<TE>   The production line for the 717 program, which employs 2,300, got
a reprieve in December after Boeing officials considered shutting
down Southern California's last remaining commercial aircraft
manufacturing facility. Before the Midwest Express order, Boeing had
registered 137 orders for the airplanes and had delivered 96. The 717
program was launched in 1995 by the then-McDonnell Douglas Corp.</TE>

<HD>Monsanto Seeks OK for Bioengineered Canola</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Monsanto Co., the biggest developer of genetically engineered crops,
said Monday it asked the U.S. government to approve a bioengineered
variety of canola that may already have found its way into U.S.
crops.</LD>
<LD>   Genetic material from the unapproved strain, known as GT200,
showed up last year in Monsanto canola seeds in Canada, prompting a
recall. Monsanto said it is seeking U.S. approval so that any U.S.
crops found to contain traces of GT200 still could be sold.</LD>
<LD>   Monsanto has never found GT200 in seeds intended for planting in
the U.S. and doesn't plan commercial sales of it, spokesman Loren
Wassell said. U.S. approval would let Monsanto avoid a recall in case
traces of the variety turn up in U.S. crops, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Monsanto developed GT200 to create a canola variety that would
withstand applications of Monsanto's Roundup, the leading U.S.
weedkiller. The company later developed RT73, which was approved and
is in use, Wassell said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Monsanto has received clearance from the Environmental
Protection Agency for GT200 and is seeking approvals from the Food
and Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't made any comment, one way or the other, which way
we're leaning," USDA spokeswoman Alisa Harrison said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of St. Louis-based Monsanto fell 22 cents to $32.60 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Office Vacancy Rate Continues to Rise in L.A.</HD>
<DH>Market: Weak demand pushes availability up to 16.29% in
first quarter as tenants are reluctant to sign long-term leases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The greater Los Angeles office market continued to weaken during the
first quarter as the vacancy rate rose in nearly all districts and
most tenants remained reluctant to sign long-term leases, brokers
said.</LD>
<LD>   The overall office vacancy rate rose to 16.29%, up from 15.45% at
the end of 2001, said a report by Insignia/ESG, a commercial real
estate brokerage and services firm. The vacancy rate was up
substantially from the first quarter last year, when it stood at
12.65%.</LD>
<LD>   "The [first quarter] activity was horrible," said Bruce Schuman, a
broker at real estate services firm Julien J. Studley Inc.</LD>
<TE>   The average asking monthly rent of $2.28 a square foot remained
unchanged from year-ago levels, according to Insignia/ESG. However,
landlords have been offering a growing number of concessions to
tenants--such as a period of free rent--that can result in
substantial savings from formal asking rents, local brokers said.</TE>
<TE>   Concessions have become more common as landlords face a growing
pool of vacant space and tenants who are subleasing space at bargain
rents.</TE>
<TE>   During the first quarter, the inventory of office space that
became vacant or available for lease rose by about 625,000 square
feet, according to Insigna/ESG.</TE>
<TE>   "On a five-year deal, you might see three to seven months of free
rent," said Nick Christensen, a CB Richard Ellis broker who
specializes in the office market on L.A.'s Westside. "It's indicative
of the climate."</TE>
<TE>   After more than a year of weak demand, many office markets across
the area posted vacancy rates above 20% during the first quarter,
including Westwood, Marina del Rey, Hollywood, the western San
Fernando Valley and the Los Angeles International Airport area,
according to Insignia/ESG.</TE>
<TE>   In the Tri-Cities market, which consists of Burbank, Glendale and
Pasadena, many recently completed or soon-to-be-completed office
buildings stand empty, brokers said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are just not a lot of [tenants] floating around looking for
space," said broker Nico Vilgiate at Insignia/ESG.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the lackluster first quarter, there were some signs that
the market was approaching a bottom. Some brokers reported an
increase in inquiries from prospective tenants as landlords have
increased concessions and the economy shows signs of a turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   There were even some promising signs in the once highflying
Westside office market, which was hit hard by the dot-com bust and
retrenching entertainment and high-technology firms.</TE>
<TE>   During the first quarter, the amount of available and vacant space
grew by more than 57,000 square feet--substantially less than in
previous quarters, when that figure often soared above 500,000 square
feet.</TE>
<TE>   "While available space is increasing ... it looks like the worst
is behind us," said Kevin Morrow, head of research in Los Angeles for
Insignia/ESG.</TE>

<HD>Oil Prices Rise 4% as Venezuelan Regime Is Restored</HD>
<DH>Energy: Investors worry about supplies despite assurances;
still, U.S. motorists pay less at the pump.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oil prices rose 4% on global markets Monday, reflecting nervousness
about Venezuelan supplies after demonstrators and the military put
deposed President Hugo Chavez back in charge of the oil-producing
nation.</LD>
<LD>   Nearest-term future contracts for May delivery of crude rose $1.08
a barrel to $24.55, despite assurances from Petroleos de Venezuela,
or PDVSA, that the nation's production of crude oil would be back to
100% of its normal levels by today.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the average price in the U.S. for a gallon of
self-serve regular gasoline declined for the first time in nine
weeks, the Energy Information Administration reported Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Oil stocks climbed as investors fretted over production levels in
Venezuela, the world's fourth-largest crude exporter. Exxon Mobil
Corp., the world's biggest publicly traded oil company, rose 30 cents
to $41.60 on the New York Stock Exchange, and the Philadelphia oil
services index soared 4%.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's turmoil in Venezuela, which boomeranged from the
overthrow Friday of the populist leader to his restoration to power
early Sunday, has roiled crude oil markets. Chavez's overthrow caused
oil prices to plunge Friday, on traders' assumption that the new
regime would boost output and reverse Chavez's strict adherence to
OPEC quotas.</TE>
<TE>   Labor unrest and deteriorating plants have cost the state-owned
oil giant 1 million barrels of production capacity over the last six
months. Of Venezuela's average shipments of 2.5 million barrels a
day, about half is sold to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   PDVSA workers attended meetings Monday at which the Chavez
government was expected to continue with conciliatory overtures. On
Sunday, Chavez accepted the resignations of the PDVSA president and
the entire board of directors, which he had stacked with his
loyalists in February.</TE>
<TE>   There was no word Monday on replacement of the PDVSA board. Asked
when the oil giant might receive new leadership, a PDVSA spokesman
said, "That's for the president of the republic to say."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, prices changed direction again. "Venezuela is the wild
card," said Peter Zipf of Platts Oilgram News in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Zipf said Chavez has promised to reinstate some fired workers,
which would help improve labor relations.</TE>
<TE>   "Normal production seems to be resuming fairly quickly, and some
big refineries should be back up to full production by Wednesday,"
Zipf said. "It could be fairly routine if the workers return to work
and the government brings PDVSA management and dissidents into the
discussion."</TE>
<TE>   But market doubts are bound to linger about whether Venezuela can
regain its equilibrium over the next several weeks given the
polarization of society and the bitter experience of last week,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the gyrations in crude oil, U.S. gasoline prices are
slipping because inventories are the highest they have been in
months, said Bob Van der Valk, manager of fuel supply and marketing
for Cosby Oil Co., an independent fuel distributor based in Santa Fe
Springs.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. average for self-serve regular gasoline fell nearly a
penny to $1.404 per gallon from $1.413 per gallon a week ago, the EIA
said, based on a weekly survey of 800 service stations. The average
is up about 30 cents since mid-February. A year ago the price was
nearly 17 cents higher.</TE>
<TE>   The California average slipped half a cent to $1.617 per gallon,
and the Los Angeles average was unchanged at $1.581 per gallon, the
EIA said.</TE>
<TE>   Gasoline prices on the spot market in Los Angeles have dropped
more than a dime in the last two weeks, which may translate into a
nickel-a-gallon decrease in local retail prices by the end of the
week, Van der Valk said.</TE>
<TE>   Some market watchers expect the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries to vote for a production increase at its June
meeting, a move economists would welcome because it would keep a
global recovery on track.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with Bloomberg News on Monday, OPEC President
Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria said the oil cartel may consider boosting
production if a recovery raises demand.</TE>
<TE>   If OPEC does boost production, it would be the first such increase
since 2000.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Handspring Inc. reported a fiscal third-quarter loss as revenue fell
by more than half, and pushed back by six months its goal for turning
a profit, amid a bumpy roll-out of its newest phone-based devices and
shrinking demand for its older handheld computers.</LD>
<LD>   The news sent Handspring shares reeling. The stock tumbled 23% in
after-hours trade to $2.83, after having closed up 37 cents at $3.72
on Nasdaq.</LD>
<LD>   Excluding one-time items, Handspring lost $19.2 million, or 14
cents a share. It had a net loss of $27.2 million, or 26 cents, a
year ago.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue for the quarter ended March 30 dropped 52% to $59.7
million.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts on average were expecting a 12-cent loss, with revenue of
about $62 million, according to Multex Global Estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Mountain View, Calif.-based Handspring slashed its outlook for
revenue in the fourth quarter to between $47 million and $57 million,
compared with analysts' outlook of $89 million.</TE>
<TE>   The company now predicts it will reach profitability in the
quarter ending in December, rather than its previous goal of the June
quarter.</TE>

<LD>Exide Technologies Inc., the world's largest automotive battery
maker, said it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, weighed
down by debt incurred from an acquisition spree and a slowing auto
industry.</LD>
<LD>   The Princeton, N.J., company said it had arranged $415 million in
new financing, including $250million in debtor-in-possession
financing from Citicorp USA Inc. and other banks. It also includes
$165 million in financing by Citibank Inc. and other banks for its
units outside the U.S., which are not included in the bankruptcy
filing.</LD>
<LD>   The company, whose battery brands include Champion, Exide and
Orbital, was delisted from the NYSE on Feb. 11.</LD>

<LD>Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc. named a key executive from its
largest shareholder as it tries to counter a wave of bad news that
has cut its stock price in half.</LD>
<LD>   Gemstar, a maker of television program guides, named Jeff Shell
co-president and chief operating officer. Shell previously served as
president and chief executive of News Corp.'s Fox Cable Networks
Group. News Corp. holds a 42.6% stake in Gemstar.</LD>
<LD>   Shell's appointment comes less than a month after Peter Boylan
resigned as Gemstar co-president and the company's stock started its
slide from the low $20s to less than $10. In the first quarter of
2000 the stock peaked at over $90 a share.</LD>

<LD>   Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has taken too long to clean up

<LD>U.S. inventories fell in February for a 13th straight month as sales
declined, suggesting businesses will be slow to add to stockpiles
until a recovery gathers speed.</LD>
<LD>   The 0.1% drop in stocks of unsold goods, reflecting declines at
wholesalers and manufacturers, matched January's decrease, the
Commerce Department said. Business sales fell 0.9% in February, after
a 0.9% January rise.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Corning Inc., the No.1 maker of optical fiber, will cut about 4,000
more jobs and said Chief Executive John Loose will step down after a
little more than a year in the job. Chairman James Houghton will
become CEO.</LD>
<LD>   The company said in a preliminary report that it had a
first-quarter loss of 10 cents a share, smaller than the 17-cent loss
that analysts had forecast, as sales fell to $900 million, below its
estimate of at least $925million. Corning, which eliminated 12,000
positions last year, is cutting more jobs to reduce expenses after
demand for its products fell further.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of the Corning, N.Y.-based company fell 2 cents to $6.83 on
the New York Stock Exchange. They have fallen 71% in the last year.</LD>

<HD>Seven Arrested in Tax Shelter Scheme</HD>
<DH>Scams: The charges include conspiracy to defraud the IRS
and creating trusts to illegally hide income.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seven Californians, including the author of books on tax avoidance,
were arrested Monday on various federal charges related to the
alleged promotion of bogus tax shelters, the Internal Revenue Service
said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Lynne Meredith of Sunset Beach, author of two books that purport
to teach individuals how to legally stop paying income taxes, and six
other individuals who worked as trust salespeople in Meredith's
various enterprises, were indicted on a total of 35 federal charges.</LD>
<LD>   The charges included conspiracy to defraud the IRS and
fraudulently using Social Security numbers and passports.</LD>
<TE>   Meredith and other officials of her companies, We the People and
Sovereignty Pure Trusts, could not be reached for comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment alleges that Meredith earned more than $6.2 million
over a five-year period by holding seminars, selling books and
creating trusts aimed at helping taxpayers illegally hide income from
tax authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The government also alleges that Meredith didn't file tax returns
or pay tax on her own income from 1994 through 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Tax protest groups, such as We the People, take disconnected
pieces of court cases and federal laws to assert one of several
arguments--that the U.S. tax system is voluntary; that income derived
from legal work is not taxable; or that the law authorizing federal
income taxes was never properly ratified and consequently the entire
U.S. tax system is invalid.</TE>
<TE>   None of these arguments have ever been successful in court, said
tax attorney Elliot H. Kajan, partner with Kajan, Mather &amp; Barish in
Beverly Hills, but taxpayers sometimes buy into the argument.</TE>
<TE>   Also arrested Monday were Gayle Bybee of Sunset Beach, Gregory
Paul Karl of Solana Beach, Teresa Manharth Giordano and Willie Watts
of Murrieta, Betty Erickson of Windsor, and Nora Moore of Huntington
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Those arrested were charged with varying counts of conspiracy,
mail fraud and failing to file tax returns.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the number of charges, some of the individuals could
face up to 20 years in prison if convicted, according to the
indictments.</TE>
<TE>   Kajan said the indictments were aimed at sending a message as this
year's tax filing season comes to a close.</TE>
<TE>   "They serve as a lesson and deterrent to people who might be
considering getting into these things," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The IRS is coming out now in an effort to advise the public that
no matter what they thought they could get away with in the past,
they are not going to be able to get away with it in the present and
the future," Kajan said. "It will be a busy time for lawyers and
accountants."</TE>
<TE>   The IRS has taken several recent steps against tax cheating, which
is believed to cost the federal government $70 billion in lost
revenue a year.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the government filed civil suits against tax promoters
in San Diego, Boston and Cincinnati for allegedly selling bogus
trusts to hundreds of taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS also secured deals with credit card companies to get
access to the credit transactions of customers who use offshore
banks--havens for tax scofflaws.</TE>

<HD>Simplification Bill Aimed at Child-Related Tax Breaks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Treasury Department used Monday's tax filing deadline to launch
the first in an expected series of tax simplification proposals--this
one aimed at creating a single definition of a "qualifying child" for
purposes of all the various child-oriented tax breaks.</LD>
<LD>   Next year, there will be more than 52 million taxpayers with
children. They shouldn't have to sift through several definitions to
find out whether they can claim any or each of the tax breaks related
to children, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said.</LD>
<LD>   Among the areas of the tax code that have different definitions of
who qualifies as a child for tax purposes: the child tax credit, the
earned income tax credit, the child-care tax credit, head of
household filing status and dependency exemptions.</LD>
<TE>   Rep. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) plans this week to introduce a tax
simplification measure that will create a single definition of a
child and attack other areas of chronic confusion, such as the
alternative minimum tax and the variety of income levels at which
different tax breaks "phase out."</TE>
<TE>   "Every American knows what a child is, yet the tax code defines
child in six different ways," Portman said. "This is the type of
thing that makes tax forms a nightmare to fill out."</TE>

<HD>Specialty Labs May Lose License</HD>
<DH>Health care: Firm denies problems with quality and
proficiency and says it will appeal revocation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Specialty Laboratories Inc., one of the nation's largest providers of
specialized medical testing, said Monday that the federal government
is seeking to revoke its laboratory license and has ceased payments
under Medicare and Medicaid.</LD>
<LD>   The sanctions, stemming from the Santa Monica-based firm's alleged
use of improperly licensed lab personnel and quality control
problems, sent Specialty's stock plunging nearly 22% to close at an
all-time low of $9 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock, which
traded as high as $47 in June, declined 35% on Thursday after the
company announced an unexpected shortfall in first-quarter earnings.</LD>
<LD>   Permanent revocation of the license, scheduled to take effect
Monday, could jeopardize the company's survival. Specialty said it
will appeal the revocation, which would not take effect until the
appeal is completed.</LD>
<TE>   Some Wall Street analysts said they expected Specialty to survive
and to come into compliance, but added that it is vital for the
company to keep its license.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a risk that they might get shut down," said Tom
Gallucci, an analyst for Merrill Lynch.</TE>
<TE>   "They have to correct this, but the real question is what cost,
and whether customers will defect in the interim," said US
Bancorp/Piper Jaffray analyst Bill Bonello.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, the firm said it "believes that it has at all
times provided the highest quality clinical diagnostic testing
services ... and believes it is now in compliance with all applicable
regulations."</TE>
<TE>   Specialty Labs said the affected Medicare and Medicaid testing
represents less than 6% of its revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The sanctions come at a difficult time for Specialty, which
performs specialized tests for other labs as well as for hospitals
and doctors. The company already was reeling from sudden
consolidations in the medical lab-testing industry that eventually
will take away three of its top customers for lab work.</TE>
<TE>   Quest Diagnostics Inc. has acquired two of those companies and has
a pending acquisition of a major Specialty customer, Tarzana-based
Unilab Corp. The Quest-Unilab deal would remove $800,000 a month in
referral testing from Specialty, and may give Quest the ability to do
its own in-house testing.</TE>
<TE>   Based on state and federal findings, Specialty allowed employees
without proper licenses to perform and supervise highly complex
clinical tests, according to the federal Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services and the California Department of Health Services.
Federal officials also said Specialty had problems with quality
control.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials announced a $3,000 fine for every day of
noncompliance with federal and state regulations concerning the
licensing of Specialty's employees. Specialty said it would appeal
the fine.</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Health Services has imposed a
$224,000 fine on Specialty and will conduct random on-site monitoring
of the company for three years at the company's expense.</TE>
<TE>   In its first-quarter earnings conference last week, the company
had denied any proficiency or test quality issues.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said there are some reasons for optimism if the company
can keep its license.</TE>
<TE>   The company has virtually no debt, $75 million in cash and was
moving to strengthen its role in performing tests for hospitals
instead of labs.</TE>

<DL>OVERLAND PARK, Kan.</DL>
<LD>Sprint Corp., the No. 3 U.S. long-distance firm, on Monday reported a
turnaround profit for the first quarter and said it's making progress
in efforts to boost earnings.</LD>
<LD>   On a consolidated basis, including both its long-distance phone
and wireless communications businesses, Sprint's earnings totaled
$140 million, contrasted with a loss of $76 million a year ago.
Revenue rose 8% to $6.76 billion.</LD>
<LD>   FON Group, Sprint's local and long-distance service, said
operating profit fell 9% to $286 million, or 32 cents a share, 2
cents better than the average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson
Financial/First Call. Sales fell 8% to $4.03 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Long-distance sales have slumped throughout the industry as rates
dropped and AT&amp;T Corp. and WorldCom Inc. launched flat-rate calling
plans.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint said it saw signs that long-distance pricing had begun to
stabilize in the first quarter, but it wanted more time to determine
if the worst was over.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint PCS, the company's wireless unit, reported a loss of $146
million, or 15 cents a share, compared with a loss of $391 million,
or 40 cents, a year earlier as revenue climbed 41% to $2.85 billion.
Analysts had expected a loss of 20 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint's results and outlook sent its shares surging in after-
hours activity. Sprint FON, down 78 cents to $13.47 in regular New
York Stock Exchange trading, rose to $14.10 after hours. Sprint PCS,
up 6 cents to $10.02 in regular trading, jumped to $11.30 after
hours.</TE>

<HD>Chip-Industry Leaders See Orders in Upswing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Novellus Systems Inc. roused the slumbering semiconductor equipment
industry Monday by forecasting hefty order growth and strong profit
for the second quarter, even as it recorded a first-quarter sales
drop of 63%.</LD>
<LD>   The first chip-equipment maker to report its earnings for the
first quarter, San Jose-based Novellus appeared to convince Wall
Street that the industry's 18-month slump has given way to a new
cycle of growth.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Texas Instruments Inc., the world's No. 1 maker of
semiconductors for mobile phones, posted better-than-expected results
for the first quarter and said sales were starting to pick up as
equipment makers restock TI chips after a year of cutting
inventories.</LD>
<TE>   "The customers come back in slow trickles first," said James
Covello, chip equipment analyst at Goldman Sachs. "Right now, it
looks like the floodgates are opening up a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Novellus soared 7% in after-hours trading to $53.85,
from their close of $50.40, up $1.69, on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas-based Texas Instruments reported an operating profit of
$24million, or 1 cent a share, down 92% from $317 million, or 18
cents, a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The first-quarter consensus analyst profit forecast was nil,
according to research firm Thomson Financial/First Call. Revenue
tumbled 28% to $1.83 billion from a year ago but exceeded the $1.8
billion analysts had forecast.</TE>
<TE>   More important, analysts said, was that TI's semiconductor orders
rose 18% in the first quarter from the fourth quarter, with orders
for analog chips up more than 30%. The company predicted that total
revenue would rise 10% in the second quarter from the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Texas Instruments rose 33 cents to $32.13 on the New
York Stock Exchange before the results were released.</TE>
<TE>   Novellus reported first-quarter net orders of $175 million, far
above its earlier projection of $130million to $150 million. The
company predicted further growth in orders in the second quarter, up
43% to $250 million.</TE>
<TE>   Novellus reported a first-quarter loss of $3.3 million, or 2 cents
a share, excluding a one-time net special benefit and a gain on the
sale of an investment, compared with profit of $82.1 million, or
55cents, a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Net sales--which usually reflect orders made several months
before--fell 85% to $170 million.</TE>
<TE>   Orders are the preferred measure of industry growth for many chip
equipment analysts, reflecting more current business conditions than
sales. Accounting rules prevent chip equipment makers from
recognizing revenue until they build the product and the customer
receives and accepts it.</TE>
<TE>   Novellus forecast a second-quarter profit of 6 cents a share,
above analysts' average estimate of a 1-cent loss.</TE>

<HD>Tribune in Tax Dispute Over Times Mirror Deals</HD>
<DH>Media: The IRS says the company owes taxes and penalties of
$880 million because of transactions that preceded purchase.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. MILLER</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Tribune Co. acquired Times Mirror Co. nearly two years ago, it
picked up seven daily newspapers--and maybe a giant tax headache as
well.</LD>
<LD>   The Chicago-based media holding company is locked in a high-stakes
dispute with the Internal Revenue Service over the tax accounting on
a couple of transactions that Times Mirror pulled off in 1998. If the
IRS gets its way, Tribune will have to pay the government $880
million in back taxes, penalties and interest. That's more money than
the company has earned over the last two years.</LD>
<LD>   Times Mirror originally set aside about $180 million as a tax
reserve to cover the disputed deals. But the IRS is demanding the
higher figure. Wall Street, however, appears to have only minor
qualms about the potential exposure for Tribune, which publishes the
Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, nine other daily newspapers and
owns 23 TV stations nationwide.</LD>
<TE>   The prospect of Tribune losing its tax fight "isn't built into my
projections" for Tribune, said Brian Shipman, an analyst with
Robertson Stephens. Shipman figures "the chances are slim" that
Tribune will lose. He added, "If they were ever to have to pay any or
all of that amount, it would be viewed as a one-time occurrence."</TE>
<TE>   It was Times Mirror that aggressively pushed the accounting
envelope. But Tribune inherited the potential tax burden when it
acquired the Los Angeles-based publisher for about $8 billion in
stock and cash in June 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Since the acquisition, the IRS has continued to scrutinize Times
Mirror's deals. A year ago, in its first 10-K report to the
Securities and Exchange Commission since the acquisition, Tribune
disclosed that the two 1998 Times Mirror transactions were "under
review" by the IRS, and that Tribune could face back taxes of up to
$600 million.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2001 10-K report filed last month, however, Tribune
disclosed that the IRS is pressing ahead. After completing its audit,
the IRS last year issued a "notice of proposed adjustment," Tribune
said.</TE>
<TE>   "If the IRS prevails," Tribune reported, the company would owe not
only the $600 million in state and federal taxes due for 1998, but
also $160 million in accrued interest and a penalty of about $120
million.</TE>
<TE>   An IRS spokeswoman, citing agency policy, declined to comment on
the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   A Tribune spokesman, asked when the company thinks the issue will
be resolved and whether the dispute is likely to damage earnings,
said: "Because this is a matter under IRS review, I'm not in a
position to comment beyond what the [10-K] document says."</TE>
<TE>   Tribune's filing says that the company intends to "vigorously
defend" against the IRS case and that the outcome of the dispute is
"unpredictable."</TE>
<TE>   The case hinges on some controversial and dauntingly complex
asset-shifting that Times Mirror carried out in 1998. That year,
Times Mirror transferred its Matthew Bender &amp; Co. legal-publishing
business to European publisher Reed Elsevier.</TE>
<TE>   Times Mirror indirectly received $1.38 billion in cash from Reed
Elsevier. But in its dealings with the IRS, the company insisted that
the deal was a "corporate reorganization," and thus tax-free.</TE>
<TE>   The deal looked like a sale to a number of observers. The
transaction was structured so that Times Mirror was made the
"manager" of a specially created company whose only asset was the
cash paid in by Reed Elsevier. Times Mirror controlled the funds,
spending some of the money to buy back its own shares. Times Mirror,
which was known for aggressive tax policies, liked the structure so
much that it reorganized another subsidiary later in 1998 using the
same procedure.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the tab for the aggressive accounting may be coming due. When
Tribune said the IRS was reviewing the case, the news earned a shrug
from the investing community. But when the latest filing disclosed
that the IRS has made a formal determination against Tribune,
interest in the transaction rose.</TE>
<TE>   While Tribune's potential financial exposure is big, "we recognize
that there is likely to be significant and potentially long-term
litigation" before the case is resolved, said analyst Al Turner of
Fitch Ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Turner marked down by one notch Fitch's rating on
Tribune's senior unsecured debt, subordinated debt and commercial
paper. The tax case "was a factor we noted, but was by no means a
determinative factor," Turner said. The debt markdown "primarily
reflected the lower level of earnings the company expects over 2002"
as a result of industry conditions, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The downgrade also anticipates a possibility that Tribune, known
as a substantial consolidator in the broadcast and publishing
sectors, may opt to stress its balance sheet more by undertaking
further acquisitions during 2002 or 2003.</TE>

<HD>MCI Unveils Unlimited Calling Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLINTON, Miss.</DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc. is delving deeper into the local phone market with a
new initiative that offers unlimited local and long-distance calls
for a flat monthly fee of about $55.</LD>
<LD>   The Neighborhood, announced Monday and offered by WorldCom's
consumer MCI Group, will place the company in direct competition with
local Bell companies such as Verizon Communications Inc. and SBC
Communications Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The plan is available immediately in 32 states and provides
"all-you-can-eat" local and long-distance calling in the United
States--a new offering in the industry, said analyst Pat Comack of
Guzman &amp; Co. in Miami.</LD>
<TE>   But at costs between $49.99 and $59.99 a month, Comack questions
how competitive the Neighborhood will be. He said consumers typically
spend $55 a month for traditional local and long-distance service
already.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom said it expects to offer the service nationwide by early
next year.</TE>
<TE>   Long-distance price competition has battered the MCI side of
WorldCom's business and prompted the company to create an MCI
tracking stock last year.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom Group shares rose 6 cents to $5.07, while MCI Group rose
3 cents to $4.75, both on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>Bulletin: Tiger Woods is human after all.</LD>
<LD>   That may come as a surprise to those who see him methodically
devour golf courses and opponents, appearing impervious to the
pressure of not only competing against the best around today, but
also the best who ever swung a club.</LD>
<LD>   But Woods told Jay Mariotti of the Chicago Sun-Times, you should
have seen him after winning the Masters last year, his fourth
straight victory in a major.</LD>
<TE>   "I wore myself out that week," Woods said. "I got really sick and
I was in bed for three days after the tournament and had a 104
temperature. I put so much into that event, trying to block
everything out, that it finally caught up to me. My body broke down."</TE>
<TE>   Said his coach, Butch Harmon: "The winning of four majors in a
row, the leading up to it, the preparing for it, what you saw the
rest of the year was a kind of emotional letdown."</TE>
<TE>   He wouldn't drive drunk: "What was it?" wrote Nick Canepa in the
San Diego Union Tribune about this year's Masters. "The immense
presence of Woods being tied for the lead after the third round? The
pressure of trying to catch him? The pimento cheese sandwiches they
favor here? What?</TE>
<TE>   "All I know is that the back nine of Augusta National [Sunday] was
like a drunk tank. Tiger was the only one sober. The designated
driver."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Woods once shot a 48 for nine holes. What was so
great about that?</TE>
<TE>   A sure thing: Texas Ranger outfielder Juan Gonzalez, out because
of a torn muscle in his right hand, was put on the disabled list
April 11--for the eighth time in his career. "Damn," wrote Tim Keown
of ESPN.com, "I had April 16 in the office pool."</TE>
<TE>   Shaky start: Making his Masters debut at 22 wasn't easy for
Charles Howell III.</TE>
<TE>   In describing his first day in the tournament to the Boston Globe,
Howell said, "I was really nervous. My calves were shaking, and how
in the heck you get calves to shake is beyond me."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Woods was 3 years old at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Czech it out: This time of year in the NHL, motivation is a given.</TE>
<TE>   But with Roman Cechmanek being named starting goalie for the
Philadelphia Flyers as they open the playoffs against the Ottawa
Senators on Wednesday, his fellow Flyers have come up with a unique
carrot to dangle in front of Cechmanek's masked face.</TE>
<TE>   "We just keep telling him he could be the first Czech goalie to
win a [Stanley] Cup," forward Mark Recchi said. "They can say
whatever they want, that's the one thing that [Dominik] Hasek doesn't
have yet."</TE>
<TE>   Cechmanek was Hasek's backup on the Czech Republic's 1998 gold
medal-winning Olympic team.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: The New York Daily News reports, "The New York Mets,
whose team payroll is more than $100 million a year, are firing two
dozen ladies' room attendants [at Shea Stadium] who earn $12.50 an
hour."</TE>
<TE>   Said attendant Karen Susech: "I love that job. I have customers I
get Christmas cards from."</TE>
<TE>   Fellow worker Adrienne Atkinson pointed out some of the
conveniences fans will be missing.</TE>
<TE>   "We keep up the bathroom--make sure that there's no floods," she
said. "And we make sure no men go in there."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It took a victory over the New York Yankees to convince former
All-Star closer Derek Lowe that he belongs as a starter for the
Boston Red Sox, even though he came within six outs of a no-hitter
two weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   "This is probably the best game I've pitched," Lowe said after a
4-3 victory over the Yankees on Monday at Boston. "It was a test for
me."</LD>
<LD>   Lowe, who began the game 2-5 with a 7.34 earned-run average in his
career against the Yankees, struck out a career-high nine, gave up
one run and two hits and one walk in seven innings.</LD>
<TE>   He improved to 2-1 with a 1.29 ERA in three starts this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox took three of four from the four-time defending AL
champions and finished their series leading the East by half a game
over New York.</TE>
<TE>   Yankee starter Andy Pettitte (1-1) left after three innings
because of a tender left elbow, which has bothered him since the
start of spring training. Pettitte said he felt the pain on a
fastball to Tony Clark in the third inning.</TE>
<TE>   "I finally felt like I was ready to let go. I guess I wasn't,"
Pettitte said. "I let one go, and I'm back to where I was."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Joe Torre said he was "very concerned." Pettitte said he
plans to throw lightly today and doesn't plan on having tests.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 13, Texas 11--Mark McLemore atoned for a ninth-inning
error with a two-run single in the 10th at Arlington, Texas, to
extend the Mariner winning streak to eight.</TE>
<TE>   McLemore's hit against Dan Miceli (0-2) came after the reliever
loaded the bases on two walks and a single.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle, which overcame home runs by Alex Rodriguez and Carl
Everett to sweep the four-game series, has won all eight games on the
road. Last year, the Mariners set an AL record with 59 road
victories.</TE>
<TE>   Texas, which outhit Seattle, 16-15, had tied the score, 11-11, in
the ninth after McLemore dropped Kevin Mench's liner to left for a
two-base error. Mench took third on Hank Blalock's sacrifice and
scored on pinch-hitter Mike Lamb's sacrifice fly.</TE>
<TE>   Former Angel Shigetoshi Hasegawa got his first save.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 13, Baltimore 4--Paul Konerko hit a three-run homer and
matched his career high with five runs batted in at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Garland (1-1) gave up only two infield hits in the first six
innings and didn't look like the pitcher who had an 8.68 ERA in his
previous two starts.</TE>
<TE>   Garland gave up three runs and five hits in seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Johnson (0-3) lost his ninth consecutive decision.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Sele Could Use a Breakthrough</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Aaron Sele is to break out of his early-season funk and become the
dependable starting pitcher the Angels expected when they signed him
to a three-year, $24-million contract during the off-season, tonight
might be a good time for the right-hander to start paying dividends.</LD>
<LD>   Sele faces a Texas lineup batting .251, sixth worst in the
American League. A solid outing is almost a necessity for the pitcher
who got whacked in his first two outings, against powers Cleveland
and Seattle, going 0-2 with a 9.90 earned-run average.</LD>
<LD>   "Aaron had a couple of tough starts," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia
said. "But it's some subtle adjustments that are going to get him
locked in, not any major overhaul. We're confident that it's going to
happen.</LD>
<TE>   "When does it have to happen? Hopefully, it's this start. If not
this start, it's going to be fairly shortly."</TE>
<TE>   Sele, who declined to discuss his start against Texas on Sunday
after the Angels defeated the Oakland Athletics, 4-1, has given up 18
hits in 10 innings while bearing little resemblance to the pitcher
who last season won 15 games with a 3.60 ERA for Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "If you say, 'When's the time for a guy to pick it up?' for me,
it's yesterday," Scioscia said. "You have to come out here with the
feeling that you're going to be able to focus, compete and get it
done."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Momentum  has not been a word bandied about the Angel clubhouse as
the club tied for its worst start in franchise history at 3-8, but
several players indicated that the team's victory over Oakland just
might spark a winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   "We were kind of dead as far as momentum went, and I think [the
victory] is going to help in every aspect of the game," said first
baseman Scott Spiezio, whose run-scoring single in the fourth inning
put the Angels ahead to stay. "It's going to get us some momentum."</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, the victory over Oakland ended a six-game skid
and put the Angels in position to end a nine-game home stand on a
positive note. The Angels' two remaining games at home are against
Texas, the AL West bottom feeder whose only highlight has been
turning the first triple play in the majors this season.</TE>
<TE>   Less than two weeks ago, the Angels defeated the Rangers in the
first two games of a three-game series at Arlington, Texas, before
the third game was rained out. Nonetheless, the Angels are the first
to acknowledge that past success is no guarantee of future results.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, we beat them twice at their park, but that's not by any
means a team you just look beyond," said center fielder Garret
Anderson, who broke out of an 0-for-20 slump by hitting a home run in
each of the Angels' last two games. "They've got some great players."</TE>
<TE>   Texas shortstop Alex Rodriguez hit two home runs Sunday for the
21st multi-homer game of his career, but it wasn't enough and the
Rangers fell to Seattle, 9-7, to extend their losing streak to three
games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel relievers Dennis Cook and Al Levine combined to pitch two
scoreless innings Sunday, easing, for the moment at least, concerns
about the return of closer Troy Percival.</TE>
<TE>   Percival is expected to throw in a simulated game today or
Wednesday as he approaches reactivation sometime this weekend. He was
put on the 15-day disabled list April 6, retroactive to April 3,
because of a strained rib-cage muscle.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said the club is letting Percival's body dictate his
return instead of any preset timetable.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves," Scioscia said.
"We just want to make sure he's healthy before we make any
decisions."</TE>

<HD>Colorado Can't Care Who's Not There</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Avalanche offense hasn't been same without Forsberg
and Hejduk, and team isn't sure when they will return, but confidence
remains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The NHL's regular season is over, and Joe Sakic and his Colorado
Avalanche teammates are primed to defend their Stanley Cup
championship--with or without Peter Forsberg and Milan Hejduk.</LD>
<LD>   "We're ready for another run and can't wait for it to start,"
Sakic said of the Avalanche, which will play the Kings in the first
round, starting Thursday with Game 1 at Pepsi Center in Denver. "This
is when the fun starts. You have to love this time of the year.</LD>
<LD>   "We're really not sure when [Forsberg and Hejduk will return from
injuries]. But even if we don't get them back, we have enough talent
here to win it again."</LD>
<TE>   Forsberg, who did not play during the regular season because of a
sabbatical and subsequent surgery for a torn tendon in his left foot,
has been skating with the Avalanche for the last two weeks and is
believed close to returning to the lineup. But Coach Bob Hartley is
not about to push his Olympian and All-Star center until he's 100%.</TE>
<TE>   "There's absolutely no rush. He's ahead of schedule," Hartley
said. "He's progressing well and we're just waiting for our medical
staff to declare him fit for contact drills.... Once he gets some
contact, we'll be able to move on and get him into the lineup."</TE>
<TE>   Hejduk, a forward who sat out the last 20 games because of an
abdominal strain, also has been skating with his teammates since late
March. Before his injury, Hejduk had 21 goals and 44 points in 62
games.</TE>
<TE>   "Our medical staff has been working very sharply with Milan and
Peter, and whenever they feel that those guys are ready, they'll
play," said Hartley, who has not ruled out using either player
against the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Even without Forsberg and Hejduk, the Avalanche was one of the
league's elite teams, although its offense has only 212 goals, which
ranks 18th in the NHL this season.</TE>
<TE>   With goalie Patrick Roy, defenseman Rob Blake and Sakic leading
the way, Colorado had a memorable season, finishing with 99 points
and winning the Northwest Division title, the team's eighth
consecutive division title, equaling a league record set by the
Montreal Canadiens from 1975-82.</TE>
<TE>   "Injuries have been big on our team, but we've found a way to get
through it and put ourselves into position to get home ice and a
second seed in the playoffs," said Blake, who will be facing his
former King teammates in the playoffs for the second consecutive
year. "The most important thing for us now is the health of Forsberg
or Hejduk. If we get them back, that's close to 60 goals back into
our lineup."</TE>
<TE>   Although Colorado is the defending champion, the Avalanche is not
favored to win the Stanley Cup. That honor belongs to the Detroit Red
Wings, who dominated the regular season with a league-high 116
points.</TE>
<TE>   "It's only right for Detroit to be considered the team to beat,
based on the way the Red Wings played this season," Blake said. "That
really doesn't change anything for us because being the defending
Stanley Cup champion, it doesn't matter who we play. Every team is
geared up to beat us. It's been that way all year."</TE>
<TE>   Roy, who got some valuable rest when he chose not to play for
Canada in the Winter Olympics, is a major reason the Avalanche are
expected to be a force in the playoffs. The all-time leader in
regular-season wins has played on four Stanley Cup championship
teams, and his 137 playoff victories put him in a class by himself.</TE>
<TE>   "The main objective will always be winning the Stanley Cup," he
told the Denver Post at the start of the season. "I've had a chance
to touch it four times, and I hope to touch it a fifth time."</TE>
<TE>   Roy made the difference in Colorado's playoff run last year.</TE>
<TE>   After giving up four goals in a Game 1 loss to the Kings in the
second round, Roy responded by giving up only 28 goals over the next
18 playoff games, three of them shutouts.</TE>
<TE>   "First of all, I've never been a person to take things for
granted," he said. "Secondly, I will play for exactly the same things
I have in past years. You always find some objectives ... to make
things interesting."</TE>
<TE>   Another strength for the Avalanche is depth. Thanks to the growing
maturity of Chris Drury and Steven Reinprecht, and the emergence of
young forwards Alex Tanguay, Radim Vrbata and Martin Skoula, Colorado
was able to keep the season humming without missing a beat.</TE>
<TE>   "At the beginning, it was a little rough because we had a lot of
new faces and we were already coming off a pretty long season," Drury
said. "That slowed us down early in the season. But once everyone got
adjusted to each other, things started to come together.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not too concerned about what other people think. We know
what we have and if people are predicting other teams to win the Cup,
that's fine with us. The only thing that really matters is who is
there at the end and that's where we want to be."</TE>
<TE>   The wild card for Colorado will be Forsberg.</TE>
<TE>   His spleen was removed in an emergency operation during the second
round of the playoffs last season, then he had three foot surgeries
during the off-season. He was expected back for training camp, but
took an unexpected leave of absence to allow his body more time to
heal.</TE>
<TE>   Forsberg returned to Denver in January, hoping to rejoin his
teammates immediately, but a routine physical revealed the torn
tendon in his left foot.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting better and better every day," he said last week. "I
don't think I'm there yet, but I'm certainly going in the right
direction. I'm still ahead of schedule and I'm not going to take any
chances. If I'm not 100%, I'm not going to be out there."</TE>
<TE>   And if Forsberg isn't able to play in the first round, well, that
really is nothing new. "Whoever has a crystal ball and is able to
predict who is going to win the Stanley Cup this season is a very
smart man," Hartley said. "The best situation is to put the puck on
the ice and let the teams decide. It's going to be an unbelievable
and entertaining playoff. That's the way it should always be."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado would not want it any other way.</TE>

<HD>Two-Time NASCAR Champion Baker Dies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Buck Baker, a two-time Winston Cup champion who was included on
NASCAR's 50 greatest drivers list, has died. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Baker died late Sunday night at Carolinas Medical Center. Family
members said he was in the hospital for a procedure involving a
pacemaker that had been implanted earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Baker was a city bus driver in Charlotte when he turned to racing
full-time, competing in NASCAR's inaugural season.</LD>
<TE>   He went on to win 46 Winston Cup races--13th on the all-time
list--and 44 poles. He was the first back-to-back series champion,
winning titles in 1956 and 1957.</TE>
<TE>   "Throughout the entire racing world, I don't know of anybody who
would said he didn't give 110% from the time they dropped the green
flag until the time the race was over," said his son, Buddy Baker,
himself a winner of 19 NASCAR Winston Cup races.</TE>

<HD>Kenyans Are Dominant Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Kenyans are back on top of the Boston Marathon, reclaiming a winning
tradition that's now as much a part of the race as Heartbreak Hill.</LD>
<LD>   Rodgers Rop won the men's event Monday by three seconds over
Christopher Cheboiboch, and Margaret Okayo set a course record for
women in defeating two-time defending champion Catherine Ndereba.</LD>
<LD>   All are from Kenya, whose 10-year winning streak among men was
broken last year by Lee Bong-ju of South Korea, who was fifth Monday
and the first non-Kenyan to cross the finish line.</LD>
<TE>   "The Kenyans are very happy. Last year, I was not happy," Rop
said. "Before running, I said, 'We have to reclaim our title.' It's
become a tradition in Kenya to win Boston, so I had to try my level
best to win."</TE>
<TE>   As he crossed the finish line, Cheboiboch embraced Rop.</TE>
<TE>   Rop finished third in his only other marathon, in New York last
November. Okayo won the women's race there.</TE>
<TE>   Her winning time Monday was 2 hours 20 minutes 43 seconds,
defeating Uta Pippig's course record of 2:21:45 set in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Ndereba finished in 2:21:12. Elfenesh Alemu of Ethiopia was third
in 2:26:01. It was Ndereba's first marathon since she won the Chicago
race last year in a world-best 2:18:47 on a flatter course.</TE>
<TE>   Rop won in 2:09:02. Cheboiboch's time was 2:09:05. They were
followed by Kenyans Fred Kiprop and Mbarak Hussein. Both finished in
2:09:45 with Kiprop getting third.</TE>
<TE>   The winner on the hilly Boston course was almost three minutes
behind the world record of 2:05:38 set on a flatter and faster London
course Sunday by Khalid Khannouchi.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein is the brother of Ibrahim Hussein, who started Kenyan's
dominant decade by winning in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   The top American finisher, Keith Dowling of Reston, Va., finished
15th in 2:13:28. Jill Gaitenby of Northampton, Mass., was the first
U.S. woman across the finish line, finishing 13th in 2:38:55</TE>

<DH>Forward a Perfect Fit for Clippers, but Will They Pay to
Keep Him?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"It doesn't seem like a whole lot gets him down. He never has
anything bad to say. He's always got the right attitude. He dresses
in a nice suit, coming to the arena every night. He does everything
the right way, that as an owner, if you look at someone you want on
your team--this is your star who you're going to pay a lot of money
to--you would want a player to be exactly like him."</LD>
<LD>   Clipper Eric Piatkowski, on teammate Elton Brand</LD>
<LD>   Well, that's the $64,000 question, isn't it?</LD>
<TE>   Except, of course, Clipper owner Donald T. Sterling's tab for
Elton Brand may be more like $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   Brand loves the team and the town--when he played for the Chicago
Bulls, he used to come out every summer--but before he takes
Sterling's $100 million this summer, assuming Donald offers it, Elton
wants to know how the other negotiations are going.</TE>
<TE>   "I do," Brand says. "Of course, you have to be intrigued to see
what they're going to do with Michael Olowokandi, who's been playing
great; Jeff McInnis, who's been playing great."</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Brand, who isn't merely playing well. In five short
months, he has become Mr. Clipper, the greatest of them all.</TE>
<TE>   Not that it has been much of a competition. Danny Manning had two
good seasons on his way out of town, his agent having promised he'd
leave ... five years before, when the Clippers drafted Manning.
Dominique Wilkins was great here ... both months. Ron Harper had his
moments, before tearing up his knee and comparing his tenure to time
in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Cage? Loy Vaught? Benoit Benjamin? Ken Norman? Keith
Closs?</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Lawler?</TE>
<TE>   Well, you get the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if Brand is to remain Mr. Clipper, the Clippers
actually have to keep him, although under ordinary circumstances that
would be a no-brainer, even at the "maxed-out" price of $100 million
for seven seasons.</TE>
<TE>   He's 22, a three-year veteran and newly minted All-Star with
career averages of 18 points and 11 rebounds. He's leading the
Clippers through a dream season. They're on track to improve by 10
wins and these days are selling out regularly.</TE>
<TE>   With this young man, however, that's only the beginning.
Prodigious as his contribution is, it's matched, or dwarfed, by his
human qualities.</TE>
<TE>   This is the world's largest Boy Scout, not only trustworthy,
loyal, helpful and all the rest, but humble in the face of celebrity,
hard-working despite his success.</TE>
<TE>   He does get nights off to go clubbing and he's capable of messing
up, as when he and Corey Maggette played a prank on teammate Obinna
Ekezie that led to Ekezie and Brand duking it out in an elevator at
their Minneapolis hotel, the first major embarrassment Brand got to
go with all his merit badges.</TE>
<TE>   However, for an NBA player, this was such a garden-variety misstep
as to be laughable. Kobe Bryant was having one of those a week for a
while.</TE>
<TE>   The interesting thing was the reaction around the league from
people who knew Brand: disbelief.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not that kind of guy at all," said Bull Coach Bill
Cartwright, an assistant during Brand's two seasons there. "He's one
of the best guys, maybe ever."</TE>
<TE>   Ask Alvin Gentry, the Clippers' coach, who sometimes jokes about
adopting Brand.</TE>
<TE>   "Grant [Hill, whom Gentry coached in Detroit] is probably the
lowest-maintenance superstar I've ever been around in my life,"
Gentry says. "Doesn't want any preferential treatment, doesn't want
anything, just wants to be one of the guys. I think Elton is the same
way....</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know a whole lot about him [before the season] and
obviously, you think, 'Hmmm, why did Chicago ever get rid of this
guy? There's got to be something.'</TE>
<TE>   "So I keep waiting for that one thing. It's been a whole season
and I've yet to see any of that.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we could have gotten a better situation, where we
get a veteran player, we get a great guy, we get a player who plays
hard every night--and he's 22.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't usually exist out there."</TE>
<TE>   Now to see if they can keep it from going back out there.</TE>
<TE>   Peekskill, N.Y.: The Elton Years</TE>
<TE>   "One day I'd like to be as mature as Elton was when he was 14
years old."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Panzanaro, 56,</TE>
<TE>   Brand's coach at Peekskill High</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and Brand is nice to his mother.</TE>
<TE>   Seriously. Brand is tight beyond tight with his mom, Daisy, whom
he moved into a Chicago apartment near his, who now lives minutes
away from his place in a Marina del Rey high-rise.</TE>
<TE>   Daisy goes to most Clipper home games and many on the road. She's
shy and reluctant to do interviews and her protective son asks people
not to approach her.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, this story is about the drive and discipline Daisy
instilled in her son.</TE>
<TE>   Without those qualities, he wouldn't have been lost, but he
wouldn't have been an NBA star, either, only a big guy from
Peekskill, an economically depressed, blue-collar town of about
20,000 in Westchester County, 30 minutes north of Manhattan but a
world away from the bright lights.</TE>
<TE>   Daisy was a single mother, living in public housing. Panzanaro
said there were times when she and Elton were "almost homeless."</TE>
<TE>   Elton didn't understand how bad off they were. It felt like a
normal childhood to him, sort of an urban ... theme park.</TE>
<TE>   "I never really felt I was poor, even though I lived in low-income
housing," he says. "It said, 'Dunbar Heights, Low Income Housing.'</TE>
<TE>   "But I didn't feel I was poor because my mom always did what she
had to do to make sure we had, not everything, but....</TE>
<TE>   "Growing up in an apartment complex, I had 13 male friends, either
two or three years older or younger than me--so I had a great
environment to play basketball or do whatever with. I didn't feel
like I didn't have money until I got to school. When I got to school
I didn't have as many pairs of pants as everybody else and things
like that. Then you started feeling, ohhhhh.... "</TE>
<TE>   Daisy worked with mentally challenged children. Deeply religious,
she raised Elton that way. Once, when Panzanaro called a rare Sunday
practice, Elton told him he had a problem: church. Daisy worked out a
compromise: Elton would attend church, then go for the rest of
practice.</TE>
<TE>   Daisy had a deep belief everything would work out--if you did the
right thing. Elton put it to good use, in school--he was an A
student--and basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "Initially, I didn't think he was good enough as a freshman to
bring him up to the varsity," Panzanaro says. "I was going to let him
play with the JVs. I went down to referee the JV game and he was so
thoroughly dominant. I mean, he won the tap, ran to the block, they
threw him the ball, he turned and jammed it with two hands.</TE>
<TE>   "He ended up with 38 points, some ridiculous number, and I turned
to the JV coach and said, 'That's it. He's gone.'</TE>
<TE>   "Elton was the type of low-profile kid, he just came for the first
three, four weeks and worked so hard. One of my seniors who had been
starting for two years and was a really intense type of selfish kid,
he came to me and said, 'Coach, Elton should be starting over me.'</TE>
<TE>   "So I said, 'Rich, thank you. I appreciate that.' And I started
Elton."</TE>
<TE>   Brand was 6 feet 3 as a freshman, 6-8 as a senior. He looked more
like a defensive tackle than a basketball player. But he put up
numbers, his teams had a special esprit and they won a lot. Far down
the national list at the beginning, or off it, he wound up a
McDonald's All-American.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand ...</TE>
<TE>   "I still had coaches saying to me, 'He's not that good,'"
Panzanaro says. "He's just had 32 points and 18 rebounds against you
... but he didn't do it flashy."</TE>
<TE>   Panzanaro had his own concerns.</TE>
<TE>   When Brand was set to sign with Duke, he remembers his coach
telling him, "Hopefully, they'll get you in at the end of the game so
the hometown fans can see you."</TE>
<TE>   Panzanaro's best previous player had been buried in a big program,
Virginia's, and he regretted not having warned him off. Now Duke's
Mike Krzyzewski was bringing in one of his vintage classes, with two
higher-rated McDonald's All-Americans--Shane Battier and Chris
Burgess.</TE>
<TE>   Panzanaro quizzed all the coaches recruiting Brand. How much would
he play? Who was ahead of him? The session with Coach K was
memorable, if awkward.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was very forthcoming--except Coach Krzyzewski,"
Panzanaro said. "He just said, 'Well, he's a post player.'</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'But where? Four [power forward]? Five [center]? Where?'</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'We don't use fours and fives.'</TE>
<TE>   "So I said, 'Well, you've got a lot of post players. These guys
are there. Where do you see him fitting in?'</TE>
<TE>   "'Well, if he comes and he works hard, he'll play.'</TE>
<TE>   "This was getting nowhere. Finally he says to me, 'Maybe Elton
shouldn't go to Duke.'</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Coach, that's certainly not my intent, but I'm sorry you
feel that way.... I understand Elton has to work hard if he's going
to get playing time, but give me a sense of where he is. I don't want
him to get buried.'</TE>
<TE>   "So I call Elton and we get together and I tell him about the
conversation. And first thing he says to me, 'Coach, if you don't
want me to go there, I won't go there.'</TE>
<TE>   "Now, I would have been hung from the nearest tree in town if that
ever happened. The whole community wanted him to go to Duke. I said,
'No, Elton, that's not what I'm saying to you.' And we named the
names [of Duke's recruits]....</TE>
<TE>   "And he says to me, 'Coach, you know I want to play in the NBA.'</TE>
<TE>   "And I said, 'I know that.'</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Well, if I'm going to play in the NBA, don't I have to
be one of the best players in the country?'</TE>
<TE>   "And I said, 'Yes, you do.'</TE>
<TE>   "And he said, 'Well, then so what if they're all on my team?
Because at least I know what my competition is.'</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Elton, go to Duke.'"</TE>
<TE>   So Brand went to Duke and took it over, just as if it were
Peekskill High.</TE>
<TE>   He was a starter from the first game of his freshman year, when
the Blue Devils made the Final Four, to the last game of his second
and last season, when they lost to Connecticut in the championship
game.</TE>
<TE>   For Brand, that's how it always went, skepticism followed by
success.</TE>
<TE>   "We have at Peekskill, at times, struggled with academic
eligibility," Panzanaro says. "During the year, they have to have a
70 average to play.</TE>
<TE>   "During three of the four years that Elton was there, the team had
a 90% average. We've never had that, before or since."</TE>
<TE>   Some Days the Magic Works....</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't part of the dynasty. I was with the anti-dynasty. We
lost every game, so I was just thinking, like, 'We've got to get some
players or something has to happen because it's not working out for
me. Fifteen wins in an entire season.'</TE>
<TE>   "Coach [Tim] Floyd and I would joke about it because he was
catching more of the flak than I was. The players, of course, we were
all like, 'Wow, what's going on?'"</TE>
<TE>   Brand</TE>
<TE>   Then there were his Chicago years, which everyone, Brand included,
is trying to forget.</TE>
<TE>   It started routinely, with everyone wondering if Brand, who
measured 6-8 at the 1999 pre-draft camp, could play power forward in
the NBA. Fellow draft prospect Richard Hamilton even measured him on
TV at the suggestion of host Roy Firestone.</TE>
<TE>   Said Hamilton, looking at the tape: "Six ... three and a half."</TE>
<TE>   The Bulls took Brand No. 1 and were widely criticized after Steve
Francis, the No. 2 pick, and Lamar Odom, the No. 4, started fast
while Brand was getting shots blocked by the bushel.</TE>
<TE>   "I started my first two games against the Knicks, one of the most
defensively sound teams every year, and against Miami and Alonzo
Mourning," Brand says. "So shots were getting tossed all over the
place....</TE>
<TE>   "I remember Zo. That was like my second game of the season, and it
was just like, 'Welcome to the NBA.' It's like, I'm going by my man
and he's waiting there, like, boing! Get that shot outta there! It
was really a rude awakening."</TE>
<TE>   Awaken he did, though, finishing as co-rookie of the year with
Francis, becoming a 20-10 man, averaging 20 points and 10 rebounds,
then repeating that feat the next season.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Bulls went 17-65 his first season and, perhaps just
to prove things could get worse, 15-67 his second.</TE>
<TE>   Brand was always available and positive, but inside, he was
plotting his escape.</TE>
<TE>   "It was terrible," he says. "It was really bad. I'm the type
person, I could deal with losing, deal with a bad situation, but I
didn't accept it. I was upset after every loss and just had to move
on. There were times I just felt myself ... just accepting losing.
And that wasn't me.</TE>
<TE>   "So that really made me upset. I would brush it off like, 'Ahh, we
lost, OK.' You know what I mean? Because we lost 20 in a row! So, by
the 18th, I'm like, 'Oh, we lost again.' And that wasn't me, so
something had to change."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for Brand, the Bulls had come to the same conclusion
and traded him last summer for the Clippers' No. 2 overall pick, so
they could draft Tyson Chandler.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, Brand didn't know much about the Clippers, except
that they were in Los Angeles and had a colorful past.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard the stories ... guys not wanting to be here. Without a
doubt. Of course, management not paying, things like that."</TE>
<TE>   Nor did they know much about him. Says Piatkowski: "You don't see
him on the highlights every night because people want to see Darius
Miles catching alley-oops and getting dunks and stuff. But when we
played against him in Chicago, he put up big numbers against us and
every time he'd score, you'd be like, ' ... dang it, why does that
guy keep scoring?'"</TE>
<TE>   Then they found out. They also found out he could do it against
the West's huge power forwards.</TE>
<TE>   They found out how much there was to him.</TE>
<TE>   With a roster so young--the average Clipper was 24--they had an
urgent need for veteran leadership.</TE>
<TE>   It couldn't come from a reserve, like Sean Rooks, it had to be
someone who started, a Scottie Pippen or Antonio Davis, but they had
price tags of $10 million-$15 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   And then, along came Brand, who was the answer to their dreams, a
star/professional/role model/homeboy.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing you've got to respect about him more than anything else
is, he practices just about every single day," Piatkowski says. "He's
the first one there. He's the last one to leave. He's always getting
extra shots.</TE>
<TE>   "What I find the most impressive is the consistency, to be able
every single night, to be right around 20 and 10.... And lots of
nights, you don't even really notice it. Some nights, you're like,
'Oh, Elton didn't have a really good game.' You might look at the
stat sheet and he had 18 and 10 that night."</TE>
<TE>   Talk about your great situations.</TE>
<TE>   Half the roster--Brand, Odom, Maggette, Miles, Quentin Richardson
and Keyon Dooling--is between 20 and 22. Brand and Odom were friends
in New York AAU ball. Brand met Richardson in Chicago. Brand and
Maggette were friends at Duke. Maggette and Richardson were friends
from their Chicago prep days. Richardson and Miles, from downstate
Illinois, are all but joined at the hip.</TE>

are rich!</TE>

power forwards in the West, they're the best players in the NBA--Tim
Duncan, Sheed Wallace, Dirk Nowitzki.</TE>

<HD>Gentry: Selfishness Was a One-Game Thing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The way Coach Alvin Gentry sees it, the Clippers had one recent game
when they played as individuals--rather than as a team--and then
returned to their normal style of play.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think you could play 75 games as a team, then play the
last selfishly," he said. "I don't really see that at all. We had the
one game in Utah [April 3], but since then we've gone back to the way
we're capable of playing."</LD>
<LD>   Gentry certainly didn't buy center Michael Olowokandi's argument
after the loss to the Jazz that the Clippers were letting concerns
about contract negotiations turn them into selfish players in a
late-season attempt to pad their statistics. Olowokandi and point
guard Jeff McInnis are eligible to become free agents this summer,
though the Clippers can match any offer to Olowokandi.</LD>
<TE>   "Everybody's value has been set by now," Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' final two games are against Memphis and Golden
State, the two worst teams in the Western Conference. But Gentry
expects nothing but the best from the 13th-place Grizzlies tonight
and the 14th-place Warriors on Wednesday at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   "Memphis is going to want to come here and end the season on a
positive note," he said. "It's the same with Golden State. We were
the same way last year. You want to end on a positive note, so you
have something to build on for next year."</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   vs. Memphis, 7:30, Fox Sports Net</TE>
<TE>   Site--Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KSPN (1110), KTNQ (1020).</TE>
<TE>   Records--Clippers 38-42, Grizzlies 23-57.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Grizzlies--2-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Clippers have lost three games in a row, six of seven
and 11 of their last 15. They are coming off a 101-98 loss Saturday
to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Darius Miles practiced Monday. He had
been sitting out for several weeks because of a sore left knee.
McInnis did not practice because of a bruised left thigh. A victory
tonight would top the Grizzlies' total for last season. It also would
ensure the franchise's best record since it joined the NBA in
1995-96. Pau Gasol has led the Grizzlies in scoring in each of the
three games against the Clippers this season. He is a leading
candidate for rookie of the year. Memphis took a 98-95 victory Sunday
from the Houston Rockets, playing without leading scorers Steve
Francis and Cuttino Mobley.</TE>

<HD>BCS Meetings Get Nowhere</HD>
<DH>College football: Talks among commissioners to continue
today after no revisions reached.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Commissioners of the six major conferences met Monday in Phoenix to
discuss possible changes in the controversial bowl championship
series' formula, which selects the teams for college football's
national championship game.</LD>
<LD>   But after meeting for 4 1/2 hours, officials were unable to reach
any conclusions, said Tom Hansen, commissioner of the Pacific 10
Conference.</LD>
<LD>   "It's too complicated to resolve right now," Hansen said. "We have
a lot of work to do."</LD>
<TE>   Topics being discussed include cutting back or eliminating the
role of computer rankings in determining the top two teams at the end
of the regular season, scrapping the margin-of-victory factor that is
part of the computer rankings, and whether to introduce a human
element, such as an overseeing committee, into the BCS formula.</TE>
<TE>   The commissioners will meet again today to discuss BCS matters,
although Hansen was pessimistic they would reach any conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   "We may get some things resolved [today], we may not," he said.
"More likely we won't."</TE>
<TE>   The 4-year-old BCS is coming off consecutive seasons in which the
formula came under fire for its choice of a No. 2 team. Last season,
Nebraska was picked over Pac-10 champion Oregon, even though the
Cornhuskers did not win the Big 12 Conference title and were routed
by Colorado, 62-36, in their final regular-season game.</TE>
<TE>   Complaints grew louder after No. 1 Miami rolled over Nebraska,
37-14, in the Rose Bowl and Oregon beat Colorado in the Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the BCS was criticized for selecting Florida State
instead of Miami, which had beaten the Seminoles during the regular
season.</TE>
<TE>   The average of eight computer rankings is used as one of five
elements in the BCS formula, which also incorporates coaches' and
media polls, strength of schedule and team records.</TE>
<TE>   There is support for adding a human element to the BCS formula
that would increase accountability. That could result in the
formation of a committee that steps in during controversial
situations, such as last year's selection of Nebraska to play in the
national championship game.</TE>
<TE>   If nothing is resolved today, the commissioners will continue
discussions during meetings June 17-21 in San Francisco.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Elbow Injury Forces Brown to Miss Next Start</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Dodger pitcher Kevin Brown, who re-injured his surgically repaired
right elbow last weekend, will miss at least one start. But team
officials said Monday that the torn scar tissue he suffered was
superficial and not in the immediate area where the surgery was
performed.</LD>
<LD>   Brown was examined by Dodger physicians Frank Jobe and Ralph
Gambardella in Los Angeles and also underwent an MRI test and X-rays.</LD>
<LD>   "When you look along the lines of a [missed] start versus six
weeks and maybe two months and possibly the season, I'd say that's
good news," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said.</LD>
<TE>   Left-hander Omar Daal will start in Brown's place Thursday against
the San Diego Padres at Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the best we could have hoped for," said Dodger trainer
Stan Johnston, who added that Brown would take anti-inflammatory
medication and undergo therapy to reduce swelling.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who underwent surgery to repair a torn muscle last Sept.
27, felt a burning sensation in his elbow on Saturday while
delivering a 2-and-2 fastball to the Padres' Tom Lampkin in the
second inning at Qualcomm Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Johnston said Brown will receive treatment daily in Los Angeles
with physical therapist Pat Screnar and will resume throwing when the
swelling subsides.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said Brown's progress, and the workload of what is currently
a 10-man pitching staff, will be monitored during the three-game
series against Colorado before making any roster moves.</TE>
<TE>   He said it was too soon to consider the possibility of putting
Brown on the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   "It's day to day from now until Thursday," Tracy said. "We're not
going beyond that. We're not going to start speculating into two
starts from now, or two weeks from now."</TE>
<TE>   If Brown is unable to recover quickly and is put on the disabled
list, Daal will stay in the rotation and the Dodgers will recall a
relief pitcher to take Daal's spot.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger General Manager Dan Evans, however, said it was too early
to consider a rotation without Brown for a prolonged period.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to speculate about anything right now," Evans
said. "We have Omar Daal to pitch in that spot on Thursday so we're
covered."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Daal, who demanded a trade in spring training because he was not
named to the rotation, said he would be ready for his first start.</TE>
<TE>   Daal is 1-0 with a 2.16 earned-run average in four appearances
over 81/3 innings. He was available to pitch an inning or two Monday,
but Tracy did not call on him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just going to go out there and do my job," Daal said.
"Whatever happens after that I cannot control. I'm just going to do
my best."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The crowd hushed momentarily when Larry Walker swung at a pitch
from Odalis Perez in the eighth inning and lost his bat, which sailed
through the air about 15 rows into the stands behind the Rockies'
dugout.</TE>
<TE>   No one was hit by the bat.</TE>
<TE>   Perez proceeded to strike out Walker.</TE>

shutout innings against the Rockies in his first start on April 5.
Jennings gave up three runs in six innings against the Dodgers in a

<HD>Rocky Start Helps Perez</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Backed by five-run first inning, Dodger pitcher
throws a five-hitter to stop Colorado, 5-2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Despite statistical proof to the contrary, Odalis Perez did not
believe that Coors Field qualified as a pitcher's nightmare.</LD>
<LD>   So before Perez took the mound here for the first time Monday
night against the Colorado Rockies, he shut out all the talk about
the spacious dimensions and light air.</LD>
<LD>   Then the 23-year-old Dodger left-hander shut down the Rockies with
a masterful five-hitter that gave the Dodgers a 5-2 victory before
29,763.</LD>
<TE>   It was the first career complete game for Perez, who was acquired
in the January trade that sent outfielder Gary Sheffield to the
Atlanta Braves.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe how composed he is for 23 years of age," Dodger
Manager Jim Tracy said. "He is not fazed by much of anything."</TE>
<TE>   Perez (1-1), who also pitched well in his first two starts against
the San Francisco Giants, was handed a 5-0 first-inning lead on a
run-scoring single by Shawn Green, a three-run home run by Eric
Karros and a solo homer by Adrian Beltre.</TE>
<TE>   That was more than enough for Perez, who gave up a solo homer to
Todd Helton in the second inning and a run-scoring double to Benny
Agbayani in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Perez struck out five and walked one in a 128-pitch performance
that produced only the third complete game by a Dodger pitcher at
Coors Field.</TE>
<TE>   Hideo Nomo threw a 9-0 no-hitter on Sept. 17, 1996, and Dave
Mlicki beat the Rockies, 5-0, June 18, 1996.</TE>
<TE>   It also was only the 20th complete game by an opposing pitcher at
a stadium that is celebrating its 10th anniversary this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I was throwing pitches down and in and down and away," said
Perez, who lowered his earned-run average to 2.61 and lowered the
staff ERA to 3.39. "I was throwing my change-up and curveball and
everything was working together.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt fine. I was on top of the count, and when I was down I was
able to come back and throw strikes and make them hit the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Karros hits the ball better at Coors Field than perhaps any other
visiting player. He went into the game with a .362 average, 12
doubles, 18 homers and 50 runs batted in 163 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   He got his first opportunity Monday against Shawn Chacon (1-2)
after Paul Lo Duca reached on a fielder's choice and advanced to
second on a throwing error by shortstop Juan Uribe when Dave Roberts
slid hard into second base breaking up a double play.</TE>
<TE>   Green's single to right scored Lo Duca and Brian Jordan followed
with another single before Karros stepped in and hit a 3-and-2 pitch
beyond the left-field fence for his 19th career homer in the stadium,
the most by any visiting player.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre then hit a 3-and-0 pitch over the left-field fence for his
first home run of the season and a 5-0 lead that was too much for the
Rockies, who are 0-8 against National League West opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "I get to play a lot of games here," said Karros, who also had a
single and raised his season average to .302. "Obviously, this is an
offensive ballpark. You play enough here, I'm sure you're going to
put up some numbers."</TE>
<TE>   Karros noted that Perez could easily be 3-0 if he had been
provided with run support in his first two starts.</TE>
<TE>   Perez gave up three runs in 52/3 innings against the Giants in a
3-0 defeat at Dodger Stadium on April 4. He gave up one run in six
innings but did not figure in the decision in a 2-1 Dodger loss at
Pacific Bell Park on April 10. Perez's performance Monday spared
Tracy from using a bullpen that could be taxed with Omar Daal moving
into the rotation to replace Kevin Brown for at least one start.</TE>
<TE>   After Agbayani's two-out double in the sixth, Perez retired the
last 10 batters in a row. In the eighth, he struck out Uribe and
Larry Walker and got Helton to hit a fly ball to center field. Tracy
had closer Eric Gagne warming up in the ninth in case Perez stumbled.
But Todd Zeile popped out to third base, Agbayani hit a fly ball to
right and Perez struck out pinch-hitter Mark Little for the final
out.</TE>
<TE>   "That was nothing short of a tremendous performance," Tracy said.</TE>

PGA Championship in 2000 and the 2001 Masters--Tiger Woods already
claims a Grand Slam of sorts.</LD>
<LD>   However, there's only one way to silence those who say a true
Grand Slam is accomplished in one calendar year.</LD>
<TE>   "I've done four in a row before, but it would be nice to do four
in a row in the same year," Woods said after his three-stroke victory
Sunday in the Masters. "It would be different than how I did it the
last time."</TE>
<TE>   In more ways than one.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating Woods' chances for a sweep is the fact that he's
never played a professional round over the courses that will be the
sites of the next three majors. That said, there is no question that
when Woods' game is clicking, as it seems to be whenever majors roll
around, he's difficult to beat.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't any course that doesn't set up well for his game when
he's on," said Mike Schultz, the head professional at Hazeltine
National, site of the PGA Championship in August. "I don't see
anything about his game that would put him at any kind of
disadvantage on any course."</TE>
<TE>   The PGA Championship is the last major of the year, so talking
about Hazeltine may be getting a little ahead. For Woods to win a
Grand Slam, he will have to get through the U.S. Open at Bethpage
State Park Black Course in Farmingdale, N.Y., in June and the British
Open at Muirfield in July.</TE>
<TE>   Bethpage Black, which will host a major for the first time, is, at
7,214 yards, the longest course in the history of the U.S. Open. It
features three of the longest par-four holes ever used in the Open,
including the 499-yard 12th and 492-yard 10th, the two longest. The
British Open was last played at Muirfield in 1992 and before that in
1987. The course has been lengthened to 7,034 yards, nearly 100 yards
longer than 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Hazeltine National, in Chaska, Minn., has also been lengthened. It
will play at 7,360 yards, about 215 yards longer than it was when
Payne Stewart won the 1991 U.S. Open there.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, long holes play into Woods' hands. He ranks second on
the PGA Tour in driving distance with a 296.4-yard average. That and
his legendary creativity in making his way around courses should
negate any disadvantage of playing on unfamiliar turf.</TE>
<TE>   "These courses all require careful thought and course management,"
said Geoff Shackleford, a Los Angeles-based golf historian. "That's a
big part of Tiger's game. It's fun for him to go someplace new and
figure out how to play it. He's very comfortable adjusting to a new
course. [Bobby] Jones, [Jack] Nicklaus and [Ben] Hogan were the same
way. They relish that challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Lack of familiarity might hurt Woods most at the British Open.
Muirfield, in Scotland, is known for swirling, changing winds.
Experience at the course is an important factor for club selection in
certain conditions, but even that might not be enough to slow Woods.
"Muirfield will be the toughest for him because it requires that
local knowledge," Shackleford said. "But at the same time, Tiger is
one of the best ball strikers in the world and he's a great wind
player."</TE>
<TE>   Nick Faldo, at the time considered the top ball-striker and course
manager in the world, won the last two British Opens at Muirfield.
Woods is considered the current king of course management.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S. Open at Bethpage Black, Woods will face a par-70
course with only two par fives. That could hurt Woods, who is 61
under on par-five holes this year but only eight under on par fours
and one over on par threes.</TE>
<TE>   Should Woods win the U.S. Open and British Open, Schultz said he
doesn't see anything at his course that would keep Woods from winning
the first golf Grand Slam since Jones won the U.S. Open, the U.S.
Amateur, the British Amateur and the British Open in 1930.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is anything here that will stop Tiger,"
Schultz said. "Hazeltine pretty much plays into the hands of someone
like him. There are a great variety of shots and the par fives are
reachable for long hitters. It would be fun to have him win and I'm
sure if he won the next two we won't have enough tickets for the
demand."</TE>
<TE>   It's as if people love watching Woods as much as he loves playing
in--and winning--majors.</TE>
<TE>   "I thoroughly enjoy playing these majors because it's the
challenge," Woods said. "The golf course will be a lot more
difficult. You know you always have the best players in the world
attending."</TE>
<TE>   Another reason he enjoys majors: He's won six of the last 10.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry Green of UC Irvine has been declared a free agent by the NBA.</LD>
<LD>   The two-time Big West Conference player of the year is not
eligible to be selected in the June draft because he was available in
last year's draft. When the 6-foot-3 guard was not selected, he
petitioned the NCAA to return to Irvine for his senior season.</LD>
<LD>   "My goal has always been able to play in the NBA and being a free
agent probably works to my advantage," Green said in a statement
released by the school. "My agent and I have an opportunity to look
for the best possible situation for my abilities."</LD>
<TE>   Green, who holds seven Irvine career records, participated in the
Portsmouth (Va.) Invitational camp for college seniors earlier this
month and is expected to compete at the Chicago draft camp for
prospects in June.</TE>
<TE>   He led the Anteaters to National Invitation Tournament berths the
last two seasons.</TE>

<LD>   What: NBA 2K2</LD>
<LD>   Publisher: Sega</LD>
<TE>   Developer: Visual Concepts</TE>
<TE>   Platform: XBox and GameCube</TE>
<TE>   Price: $49.95</TE>
<TE>   This game can be summed up in one sentence: This is the finest
basketball video game ever made.</TE>
<TE>   No hoop game has captured the grace and athleticism as well as NBA
2K2. The power of Microsoft's XBox system renders the players with
stunning clarity and detail. Kobe looks and moves like Kobe. Shaq
looks and moves like Shaq. Mark Madsen looks and trips clumsily about
the court like Mark Madsen. The problem with many basketball video
games is that the computer is too easy to beat in one-player mode.
Many games would end with such scores as Lakers 102, 76ers 43. In NBA
2K2, the artificial intelligence of the game is surprisingly tough.</TE>
<TE>   The player's margin of error is extremely small and consistent
good play is required to defeat the computer in a solo game. On
offense, it pays to be creative because the defense in 2K2 adjusts
quickly when it looks as if you've found an easy scoring option.
Pounding the ball inside with Shaq the entire game won't work because
the opponent will start swarming him with defenders. Even if you keep
passing to Shaq, he'll get tired and start missing his shots. To work
the offense effectively, you have to react to what the defense is
giving you and be good enough on the controls to make quick moves.</TE>
<TE>   On defense you have to play tight because the computer is
extremely aggressive. You can assign matchups, call defensive sets.
The game requires concentration on both ends of the court. The XBox
and GameCube version are nearly identical, but the graphics on the
XBox version are superior. Whichever system you own, you will want to
add this game to your library.</TE>
<TE>   The game does have one major flaw. For some strange reason, in NBA
2K2, the Lakers play hard during every regular-season game.</TE>

<HD>Reinprecht Earns His Place</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He is the forgotten man in the trade that sent All-Star defenseman
Rob Blake to the Colorado Avalanche last season and brought Adam
Deadmarsh and Aaron Miller to the Kings.</LD>
<LD>   As a rookie last season, center Steven Reinprecht helped the
Avalanche win the Stanley Cup after the blockbuster February deal,
although he hardly played a key role, contributing five points in 22
playoff games. He tied for fifth among rookies in regular-season
scoring with 36 points in 80 games, among them 29 in 59 games with
the Kings.</LD>
<LD>   This season, with Peter Forsberg out of the lineup, Reinprecht
stepped up. In 67 games, he had 19 goals and 27 assists, tied for
fourth on the team with 46 points.</LD>
<TE>   "We always talk about the Rob Blake deal and what it did for the
L.A. Kings, getting Deadmarsh and Miller, and [the Avalanche] got Rob
Blake," King Coach Andy Murray said. "But the guy that's scored some
of the most unbelievable goals in the NHL this year has been Steven
Reinprecht.</TE>
<TE>   "Steven Reinprecht is a good player. He might have scored the
nicest goal I saw this year in a game at Minnesota, and he got the
tying goal against Dallas the other day.... Steven has really raised
the level of his play."</TE>
<TE>   Reinprecht's goal with 2:59 to play Sunday gave the Avalanche a
2-2 tie with the Dallas Stars, clinching the No. 2 playoff seeding in
the Western Conference and a first-round matchup with L.A.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings announced that the starting times for Games 3 and 4
against the Avalanche on April 22 and 23 have been moved up 30
minutes to 7 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Kings Like Their Chance</HD>
<DH>Hockey: L.A. finished only four points behind Colorado in
the Western Conference, and recent playoff precedent favors
lower-seeded teams.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At first glance, the Kings look like decided underdogs against the
defending Stanley Cup champion Colorado Avalanche in a first-round
playoff series.</LD>
<LD>   They are seeded seventh in the West, the Avalanche second.</LD>
<LD>   But more often than not recently, teams seeded seventh or eighth
have won their opening-round series, eliminating teams seeded first
or second nine times in 16 conference quarterfinals over the last
four seasons. Teams seeded seventh have won six of eight.</LD>
<TE>   One of those lower-seeded winners, of course, was the Kings,
seeded seventh a year ago when they bumped off the heavily favored
Detroit Red Wings.</TE>
<TE>   And this season in the Western Conference, where only the runaway
Red Wings went into the season's final day assured of their playoff
seeding, only five points separated the Avalanche from the
eighth-seeded Vancouver Canucks.</TE>
<TE>   So pardon King Coach Andy Murray for believing that his team
should not be counted out just because it finished four points behind
the Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   "We respect them as the defending Stanley Cup champions," Murray
said Monday, "but it's our feeling that we step on the ice on equal
footing with them."</TE>
<TE>   A bold statement, perhaps, but one that is not without merit.</TE>
<TE>   After upsetting the Red Wings last spring, winning the final four
games of a six-game series, the Kings pushed the Avalanche to Game 7
of the Western Conference semifinals, and this is hardly the same
Avalanche team.</TE>
<TE>   While winning its eighth consecutive division championship, the
Avalanche finished the regular season with 19 fewer points, seven
fewer victories and 12 more losses than last season. Its production
on offense fell by 58 goals, thanks in part to the absence of Peter
Forsberg, who sat out the season because of various injuries, and
high-scoring defenseman Raymond Bourque, who retired.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche was outscored, 14-13, in splitting four games with
the Kings, rarely getting the stellar goaltending it has come to
expect from Patrick Roy, who enjoyed his best season but did not play
well against the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that they're the defending Stanley Cup champions gives
them more credibility than anybody else," Murray said, "but obviously
from second to eighth place [the difference] was five points. How
equal could it get? Never in the history of the game has it been that
equal.</TE>
<TE>   "Until somebody beats Colorado, and I hope that is us, I always
think the defending Stanley Cup champions deserve to be recognized as
probably returning favorites to win the Cup. But having said that, I
think the point totals indicate how close the league is now and if
that's what's happened in the past [with lower-seeded teams winning],
it certainly could happen again because it's never been as tight as
it was this year."</TE>
<TE>   It has been speculated that Forsberg could return for the
playoffs, but Murray doesn't seem at all concerned by the
possibility.</TE>
<TE>   "He hasn't played all year," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to step right into the lineup? We're not going to feel
sorry for him if he's in the lineup....</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what to expect. He could be in there. It doesn't
matter. We're taking the attitude, it's how we need to play that will
be important. We gave them everything they could handle last year
when they had everybody. We don't think it will be any easier for us
this year just because he's not in the lineup, but we also know that
if he is in the lineup it's not going to be any easier for them,
either."</TE>
<TE>   In three seasons under Murray, including last year's playoff
series, the Kings are 10-9 against the Avalanche, 5-1 at Staples
Center.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our personnel matches up pretty good," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   A lot better, it seems, than their playoff seedings would
indicate.</TE>

<HD>Jackson's OK With Shaq's Limitations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal took no medical treatment Monday on his right knee,
slightly strained in Portland on Sunday afternoon, putting him on his
back for several minutes in the fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   So, that leaves the toe and the wrist and, oh, two or three days
in which to heal before the playoffs start this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers will play into spring for as long as O'Neal's toe
holds. And while that might sound like an unsettling notion for a
coach shooting for three-peat No. 3, he claimed it's not.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not thinking of or concerned with Shaq's foot," Phil Jackson
said. "I know what he can do and can't do without it being 100%. If
there's a limitation to his game, we can still win with that
limitation. He's probably 75, 80% of what he can play at. Maybe not
even that. At that level, he becomes more of an offensive force than
defensive rebounder, and that's a problem for us. But, we've adjusted
around it and I think our defense is a little better now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Between the two free throws that would tie the score, 115-115, in
the first overtime on Sunday, Derek Fisher was met with Ruben
Patterson and then Bonzi Wells, both trying to wreck his nerves by
brushing him, impeding him, talking to him as he made his way back to
the line.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher laughed at it then, and made the free throw, but wondered
how those tactics were condoned by the referees.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what they were trying to do," Fisher said of Patterson and
Wells. "It was ridiculous it was allowed to go on that long."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is at best comical, considering how often he dresses the
biggest, baddest matchup issue, maybe ever, but Jackson said this
weekend he has serious concerns about how the Lakers line up,
position by position, with a few of the Western Conference playoff
teams.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't match up well against many teams in this conference,"
Jackson said. "Maybe San Antonio we have enough big guys to go around
and still [Tim] Duncan can be a problem for us. But, we don't match
up well against Portland. We don't match up well against Seattle. We
still have Shaq. That's the one thing we can create shots around and
use effectively, the post passes to Shaquille. But [the Trail
Blazers'] speed, quickness, defensive ability, their shooting,
penetration, post-up players ... those are all tough.''</TE>
<TE>   An hour later, the Lakers were well on their way to losing in
double-overtime to the Trail Blazers, with O'Neal chasing Rasheed
Wallace around 25 feet from the basket.</TE>

<HD>Three-Feat Is in Sight for Lakers</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Shaq, Kobe look like old selves in win over
Seattle that puts L.A. in position to clinch No. 3 seed in West.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They stand less than a week from the playoffs and still have
championship three-peat issues, maybe some major ones.</LD>
<LD>   But, they have Shaquille O'Neal measuring doses of Indocin and
reasonably healthy, and in the second half Monday night they got Kobe
Bryant back, and so their on-and-off vulnerability is off again, at
least for the moment. It gets hard to keep up.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers beat the Seattle SuperSonics, 111-104, at Staples
Center, where O'Neal had 41 points and 11 rebounds in 34 mostly
leisurely minutes and Bryant had 19, 15 in a more Kobe-like third
quarter.</LD>
<TE>   "We had a third quarter that looked like a team I remember, that
played in the playoffs last year," Phil Jackson said of their 33-21
advantage in that period.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers, San Antonio Spurs and Dallas Mavericks each have 24
losses. If the Lakers beat the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday night at
Staples Center in their regular-season finale, they will clinch the
No. 3 seeding in the Western Conference playoffs and open this
weekend at home against the Portland Trail Blazers.</TE>
<TE>   If they lose Wednesday, they could fall to the No. 4 seeding and
play the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round, and quite
possibly lose home-court advantage for the rest of the Western
Conference playoffs. If they beat the Timberwolves, their
second-round opponent would probably be top-seeded Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   However it plays out, they'll bring O'Neal. Depending on his mood
and his toe, it might be enough. He has scored at least 32 points in
four of five games and he has made 67 of his last 94 free throws, and
31 of his last 41, after making nine of 11 Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq," Jackson said, "was incredible."</TE>
<TE>   He should not have had to play the fourth quarter against the
SuperSonics, who are drifting toward the playoffs having lost six of
seven. But, as the Lakers are prone to do, they quit playing defense
with a large, late lead, and so Jackson summoned Bryant and O'Neal
from beneath their shoulder towels to save everyone the
embarrassment. O'Neal sealed it with nine points in five minutes in
the final quarter, and finished with 16 field goals in 21 attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "He's getting ready for the playoffs, I guess," Robert Horry said.
"He knows what time it is."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant played as though distracted for much of Sunday's loss in
Portland, where his jump shot spun sideways and he missed nine of 15
shots. While he appeared to have similar fractured moments in the
first half against the SuperSonics, he made five of 11 shots in the
third quarter, including a three-pointer, his 10th in his last 57
tries.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just out there reading the game, letting my teammates play
a little more," Bryant insisted.</TE>
<TE>   In the second quarter, about halfway through, Seattle center
Jerome James stood in a defensive posture on the right wing, three
feet in front of O'Neal, fairly confident despite the fact O'Neal was
scoring at will against James and his frontcourt brethren.</TE>
<TE>   Confident, because, you know, how bad could it be?</TE>
<TE>   SportsCenter bad, as it turned out.</TE>
<TE>   Will-be-seeing-it-for-years bad.
Grandchildren-bringing-it-up-at-dinner bad. Poster bad.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal rocked forward, juked right and then crossed over left.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible James is still standing out there on the right
wing, in perfect defensive posture, waiting for O'Neal's first move.</TE>
<TE>   The next anyone knew, O'Neal was at the rim, four steps and a
one-handed dunk while the crowd gasped and roared, and his teammates
applauded and laughed as O'Neal galloped back down the floor, arms
and legs rigid.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of things I'm not allowed to do," he said. "Being
too good is a crime sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   He had 24 points by halftime, having made nine of 12 field-goal
attempts (five were dunks) and six of seven free throws.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers arrived into the season's final half-week having lost
three games in six, and having lost in two overtimes the night before
in Portland, where O'Neal played 49 minutes, Bryant played 51 and
Derek Fisher played 45. Those were all season highs for a team that
doesn't do back-to-backs well in the best of circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my guys were bored during the regular season," O'Neal
said.</TE>
<TE>   They were 7-11 on the back end of those series, primarily because
their veteran legs aren't as resilient as they once were. In
deference to that, O'Neal sat with 2:22 left in the first quarter and
did not return until nearly three minutes were gone in the second.
Neither Bryant nor Fisher started the second quarter, one of the few
times recently when O'Neal and Bryant shared the bench with a game in
question.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Adds Galaxy Flavor to Its Cup Mix</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Javier Aguirre, Mexico's World Cup soccer coach, has sprung a couple
of surprises by naming former Galaxy players Jorge Campos and Luis
Hernandez to what is tentatively Mexico's Cup roster.</LD>
<LD>   Aguirre was to have announced the actual roster Monday but instead
named a 23-player squad last week for Wednesday's warmup game against
Bulgaria at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.</LD>
<LD>   Those players, Aguirre said, will make up his World Cup team
unless something goes wrong. He said he might add or subtract players
before the May 21 roster deadline.</LD>
<TE>   Aguirre selected three goalkeepers, among them Campos, six
defenders, nine midfielders and five forwards, one of them Hernandez.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez had a largely unsuccessful two-season stint with the
Galaxy, but has been much happier in an off-the-bench role for Club
America in the Mexican league this season.</TE>
<TE>   He will not be a starter at Korea/Japan '02, where Mexico plays
Croatia, Ecuador and Italy in the first round. The Spain-based duo of
Cuahutemoc Blanco (Valladolid) and Francisco Palencia (Espanyol) are
the more likely starters.</TE>
<TE>   But with Jesus Arellano (Monterrey) suspended from the first two
games because of violent play during qualifying, "El Matador" is a
useful substitute to have on the bench alongside Jared Borguetti
(Santos Laguna).</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Campos is unlikely to displace Oscar Perez (Cruz Azul)
as the starting goalkeeper, but the veteran of the 1994 and 1998
World Cups has played well for UNAM and adds much to the team
chemistry in a backup role along with Oswaldo Sanchez (Guadalajara).</TE>
<TE>   A notable absentee on Aguirrre's roster is veteran defender
Claudio Suarez, who broke a leg in practice the day before Mexico's
1-0 loss to the United States in Denver on April 3.</TE>
<TE>   Suarez, the world's most experienced international player with 170
games for Mexico, will accompany the team to the World Cup, but not
in a playing capacity.</TE>
<TE>   The six defenders Aguirre selected are Manuel Vidrio (Pachuca),
Melvin Brown (Cruz Azul), Francisco Gabriel de Anda (Pachuca), Rafael
Marquez (Monaco, France), Alberto Rodriguez (Pachuca) and Salvador
Carmona (Toluca).</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre has left the door open for such players as defenders
Carlos Morales (Morelia) and Hector Altamirano (Santos Laguna) and
possibly even for forward Antonio De Nigris (Monterrey).</TE>
<TE>   His nine midfielders, however, appear set. They are Rafael Garcia
(Toluca), German Villa (America), Gerardo Torrado (Sevilla, Spain),
Johan Rodriguez (Santos Laguna), Alberto Garcia Aspe (Puebla),
Sigifredo Mercado (Atlas), Braulio Luna (Necaxa), Gabriel Caballero
(Pachuca) and Ramon Morales (Guadalajara).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Italy on Monday became the latest World Cup team to lose a player
to injury when central midfielder Demetrio Albertini was sidelined
for two to three months by an Achilles' tendon injury.</TE>
<TE>   The 30-year-old AC Milan player, a 79-game veteran for Italy, was
injured in Milan's loss to Juventus on Sunday. Albertini was a
starter on the Italian team that reached the quarterfinals of the
France '98 World Cup and the final of the 2000 European Championship.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Arena, the U.S. coach, said in Dublin, Ireland, that he
would name his 23-man World Cup roster and a list of stand-by players
next Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think, to a point, it's pretty clear who is going to be on the
roster but it's not all written in stone," Arena told Reuters. "There
are still a couple of people who are on the fence, but I think we're
80-90% there."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. plays Ireland on Wednesday in its final overseas warmup
before the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Organizers of the 2006 World Cup in Germany announced the 12 host
cities--Berlin, Cologne, Dortmund, Frankfurt, Gelsenkirchen, Hamburg,
Hanover, Kaiserslautern, Leipzig, Munich, Nuremberg and Stuttgart.
Munich is expected to stage the opening game, Berlin the final.</TE>
<TE>   The preliminary draw for qualifying groups will be in Frankfurt on
Dec. 5, 2003, and the final World Cup draw will be in Leipzig two
years later.</TE>
<TE>   Germany will spend $1.5 billion on building stadiums and
renovating older ones.</TE>
<TE>   "It's money well spent," German Interior Minister Otto Schily
said. "There is no better opportunity than this to showcase our
country."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   China's Coach Bora Milutinovic named a provisional 25-man squad
for the team's first-round World Cup games against Costa Rica, Brazil
and Turkey. The only newcomer is defender Gao Yao from Shandong
Luneng.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who has scored 33 goals this
season for Manchester United after having been acquired from PSV
Eindhoven last year for a record $27.3 million, has been chosen
player of the year in a vote by English Premier League players.</TE>

<HD>Mosley, Forrest Set Rematch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pomona's "Sugar" Shane Mosley said Monday he and Vernon Forrest have
agreed to terms for their welterweight championship rematch.</LD>
<LD>   The fight is scheduled for July 20 and probably will be fought at
Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis as part of the Indiana Black
Expo's summer celebration event.</LD>
<LD>   "They're paying a $1-million site fee, and unless a casino in Las
Vegas steps up in the next few days, we'll be fighting at Conseco,"
Mosley said. "Indy really wants us."</LD>
<TE>   Mosley (38-1, 35 knockouts) was knocked down twice and lost his
World Boxing Council welterweight belt by unanimous decision to
Forrest (33-0, 26 KOs) on Jan. 26 in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Mosley said he and his new promoter, Barry Frank of marketing
giant IMG, accepted a deal in which Mosley will receive 47% of the
purse, about $2.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   Forrest will earn an estimated $3.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Forrest, an Atlanta native, dominated Mosley in their first bout.
A second-round head butt drew blood on Mosley's forehead and he was
twice knocked down in the round.</TE>
<TE>   He failed to win consecutive rounds and one judge scored the
fight, 118-108.</TE>
<TE>   Forrest also eliminated Mosley in the 1992 U.S. Olympic boxing
team trials.</TE>
<TE>   Another loss would be devastating to Mosley's career, but he said
he's gladly accepting that as a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to get this fight done and move on down the road," Mosley
said. "I'm very confident. I haven't a worry in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been waiting for this opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Mosley, who gained acclaim as one of the world's best
pound-for-pound fighters after defeating Oscar De La Hoya in June
2000, contends the head butt left him dazed and allowed Forrest, an
8-to-1 underdog, to claim the upset.</TE>
<TE>   "I know in my heart why I lost and I'll show the world why it
happened," Mosley said.</TE>
<TE>   "He [Forrest] is a good fighter. But I believe I'm a super
champion.</TE>
<TE>   "And I know true champions rise to the occasion."</TE>

<HD>Bulls Hand 76ers Costly Loss, 98-96</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second consecutive year, the Chicago Bulls probably cost the
Philadelphia 76ers home-court advantage in the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Jalen Rose scored 32 points, including two free throws with two
seconds remaining, leading the Bulls to a 98-96 victory over the
76ers on Monday night at Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   The 76ers fell half a game behind Orlando for the No. 4 spot in
the Eastern Conference. The Magic holds the tiebreaker--a 3-1 record
against Philadelphia this season--should the teams finish even.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, Philadelphia lost at home to Chicago in its final
regular-season game, and it cost the 76ers home-court edge against
the Lakers in the NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, home court is important in a five-game series, but I'm
not going to make guys play when they are hurt," Coach Larry Brown
said.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia, which clinched a playoff spot Sunday, rested center
Dikembe Mutombo and also was without Allen Iverson (broken left
hand), Aaron McKie (eye) and Derrick Coleman (hyperextended knee).</TE>
<TE>   Eric Snow scored 21 points and little-used Jabari Smith added a
career-high 14 for Philadelphia, which could finish anywhere from
fourth to seventh in the East.</TE>
<TE>   But Snow missed a three-pointer at the buzzer that would have won
it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a letdown," said forward Corie Blount, who missed all seven
of his shots while filling in for Coleman. "But in the Eastern
Conference, it's not that important because everyone is so evenly
matched."</TE>
<TE>   Boston 93, Minnesota 90--Paul Pierce scored 31 points as the
Celtics held on at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics still have a chance to secure home-court advantage
through the second round of the Eastern Conference playoffs. Boston
needs to win its last game at Atlanta, and Detroit must lose its
games against New Jersey and Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   After trailing for most of the game, Minnesota took advantage of
Boston's cold fourth quarter shooting and used a 19-8 run over the
last eight minutes to pull within 91-90.</TE>
<TE>   But Wally Szczerbiak missed both attempts after being fouled by
Rodney Rodgers with 31.2 seconds remaining.</TE>

<LD>Point guard Jason Gardner, the only starter who came back from
Arizona's 2001 national runner-up basketball team, said Monday he
would return for his senior season.</LD>
<LD>   "After doing a lot of research and talking with people that I
trust, I think it's best for me to return for my senior season,"
Gardner said. "Playing in the NBA is still a dream of mine, but I
really enjoy being in college and playing with my teammates."</LD>
<LD>   Gardner averaged 20.4 points, 2.9 rebounds and 4.6 assists as a
junior last season, leading the Wildcats to a 24-10 record and a tie
for second place in the Pacific 10. They lost to Oklahoma in the West
Regional semifinals in the NCAA tournament.</LD>
<TE>   "Jason has done a good job of researching his draft prospects and
we think that he's made a wise decision," Wildcat Coach Lute Olson
said.</TE>

<KH>Lonnie White ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>Theodore Can Take Canadiens Higher</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not many outside the province of Quebec are giving eighth-seeded
Montreal much of a chance to upset top-seeded Boston in the Eastern
Conference, setting the stage for a potential first-round upset in
the Stanley Cup playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Under Coach Robbie Ftorek, who has an 8-15 playoff record, the
Bruins barely hung onto the top record in the east, going 3-5-1-1 in
their last 10 games at the FleetCenter. Despite strong seasons from
former King Glen Murray and Bill Guerin, each of whom finished the
regular season with 41 goals, Boston played like a team trying not to
lose, instead of concentrating on winning down the stretch. Even
Boston fans don't seem sold on the Bruins, who were 22nd in the
league in attendance. Boston averaged 15,404 a game, under the league
average of 16,475.</LD>
<LD>   The Canadiens, meanwhile, were third in attendance at 18,990. And
with the emotional return of captain Saku Koivu, who missed the first
80 games of the season because of cancer, Montreal became the
feel-good team of the league when it held off the high-priced
Washington Capitals and New York Rangers for the last playoff berth
in the East.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Michel Therrien has done a masterful job of turning the
Canadiens into a responsible defensive team, spearheaded by the play
of goaltender Jose Theodore.</TE>
<TE>   Theodore not only played in nearly 70% of the Canadiens' games,
but also led the league in save percentage. Theodore was at his best
when Montreal needed him most. He started all but two games after the
Olympic break and posted a goals-against average of 0.75 over a
late-season 4-0 stretch, helping the Canadiens clinch their first
playoff berth since 1997-98.</TE>
<TE>   "We [had to fight] for a playoff spot all year ... so every night,
I just push myself to be ready," Theodore said of his many starts.
"Knowing [that if] you push yourself hard enough, you can get through
without a problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, it's not easy, with all of the pressure and everything, but
that's what you've been dreaming of since you were a kid."</TE>
<TE>   After getting spotty playing time his first few seasons with the
Canadiens, Theodore got a chance to play every night last season and
made the most of it.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year was a big breakthrough for me," he said. "I played in
59 games [and had a 2.57 save percentage]."</TE>
<TE>   When Jeff Hackett went down because of injury early this season,
Theodore became the Canadiens' rock and he's the reason they will
have a chance to advance to the second round.</TE>
<TE>   Burke Better With Age</TE>
<TE>   Another goaltender who helped his team into the playoffs is
Phoenix's Sean Burke, who has resurrected his career with the Coyotes
after having played for five teams from 1997-2000.</TE>
<TE>   Burke, in his 14th NHL season, had a single-season high 34
victories and ranked third in the league in save percentage. He
credits Phoenix goaltending coach Benoit Allaire for turning his
career around.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got here to Phoenix, [Allaire] took me aside and basically
said that he felt I could be the best goaltender in the league, or at
least one of the best goaltenders, if I was committed to working on
the technical part of my game day in and day out," Burke said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's been a big difference for me. It's just working on
the little things every day. Positioning, being square to the puck,
and just making sure that those things become second nature. After
that, you let your athletic ability kind of take over and you compete
hard, and then you see where the chips fall."</TE>
<TE>   With construction of the Coyotes' new arena finally underway,
Burke likes the franchise's direction. He played for New Jersey when
the Devils began turning things around and finds a lot of
similarities with Phoenix, which will play San Jose in the first
round.</TE>
<TE>   "It's strange, because when the season starts, there's so many
unknowns," Burke said. "I think as a team, from Day 1 of training
camp, we read the things that had us being picked to finish last and
a lot of those other things.... I don't think it sat very well with
most of us."</TE>
<TE>   One of the Coyotes' top offensive players since the Olympic break
has been 5-foot-10, 170-pound center Daniel Briere, who's second on
the team in scoring. "He's a guy that probably had been counted out
by a lot of people at different times because of his size," Burke
said of Briere, who split time in the minors the last four seasons.
"He's kind of come in here this year, and from Day 1, he's been
consistently our best offensive player.... You know it's important
for him to make sure that he's capable of proving to people that he
can get through a full season at his size and be successful."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit's Big Challenge</TE>
<TE>   Thanks partly to Coach Scotty Bowman's decision to rest so many
players after clinching the President's Trophy for the league's best
record, the Detroit Red Wings ended the regular season in a slump,
winning only one of their last 10 games, going winless in their last
seven.</TE>
<TE>   Bowman is now hoping that his team can regain its form against the
Vancouver Canucks, the Red Wings' first-round opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "In the playoffs, you have to play at a higher level than the
regular season," Bowman said. "We know that we can't loaf around."</TE>
<TE>   According to Bowman, two of the driving forces for the Red Wings'
playoff hopes are veterans Dominik Hasek and Luc Robitaille.</TE>
<TE>   "They are both very motivated players right now," Bowman said.
"They know that their chances are lessening each year. A big part of
our confidence is that Luc and Dominik have never won."</TE>
<TE>   But Detroit will be facing one of the league's hottest teams in
the Canucks, who have won 28 of their last 43 games and ended the
regular season on a nine-game unbeaten streak (8-0-1).</TE>
<TE>   "This team is destined for greatness and I hope it's going to come
soon," said Canuck captain Markus Naslund, who finished second in
league scoring with 40 goals and 90 points. "We've shown that when no
one believed in us, we still stuck together and have got the job done
in really some troubled times.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to face a tough opponent but we're coming in with
lots of confidence and we feel good about ourselves."</TE>

<HD>Out of Playoffs Again, Rangers Fire Low</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Rangers' NHL-high payroll no longer includes Coach Ron
Low.</LD>
<LD>   The Rangers fired Low on Monday after two losing seasons and zero
postseason appearances despite base player salaries totaling about
$70 million in 2001-02.</LD>
<LD>   The team went 36-38-4-3 this season and finished 11th in the
Eastern Conference. It was the fifth straight year New York failed to
make the playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think it's just the coach's responsibility in a situation
like this. We all share equally in this," Ranger President and
General Manager Glen Sather said. "But in every situation, someone
ends up taking the blame and it's generally the coach. It's
unfortunate, but it's the way it has to be."</TE>
<TE>   Low's record in New York was 69-81-9-4.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to do something," Sather said. "We wanted to go into next
year with a fresh start and fresh ideas. That's what we're doing."</TE>
<TE>   Ken Hitchcock, who coached Dallas to the 1999 Stanley Cup title,
is a candidate to replace Low, Sather said. The Stars fired Hitchcock
in January.</TE>
<TE>   "I've spoken to Dallas and I've received permission" to talk to
Hitchcock, Sather said.</TE>

<TE>   Phoenix forward Brad May is facing a possible assault charge for
fighting with a nightclub bouncer and two Maricopa County Sheriff's
deputies at Scottsdale, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   The incident occurred Sunday when May argued with the bouncer at
the Cat Eye Lounge and wanted to move to the front of the line,
Sheriff Joe Arpaio said. When two deputies intervened, May punched
one in the face and wrestled with the other, he said. The deputies
handcuffed May to subdue him, Arpaio said. May was not arrested.</TE>
<TE>   An assault charge could be filed this week against May, who
appeared to be drunk during the incident, Arpaio said.</TE>

<TE>   Petr Sykora is questionable for the Devils' playoff opener against
the Carolina Hurricanes on Wednesday night because of a sore right
ankle. Also, veteran right wing Stephane Richer is not going to
accompany the team to Carolina because of a lingering injury to his
left foot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Jose recalled defenseman Steve Bancroft and right wing
Jonathan Cheechoo from Cleveland of the AHL.... Rensselaer
Polytechnic's Marc Cavosie, the Eastern College Athletic Conference
player of the year, signed with Minnesota, giving up his last year of
college eligibility.... Joe Fisher, who played in two games for the
1943 Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings, died Saturday at
Medicine Hat, Canada. He was 85.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sammy Sosa was probably the only person at Olympic Stadium who didn't
see how far his latest homer went.</LD>
<LD>   Sosa and Fred McGriff hit consecutive homer and Kerry Wood pitched
six scoreless innings Monday to lead the Cubs over the Expos, 6-4, at
Montreal.</LD>
<LD>   Sosa hit his sixth homer of the season in the fifth inning off
Carl Pavano (1-2), a drive that struck a cable 120 feet above the
left-field wall.</LD>
<TE>   Sosa's drive rose above the 160-foot-high concrete rim that
surrounds Olympic Stadium before descending and striking midway up
one of two cables from which hang a pair of speakers.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hit it, trying to go out of the ballpark, not trying to
hit a speaker. But what can you do?" Sosa said.</TE>
<TE>   Moises Alou, who missed the first two weeks of the season because
of a strained right calf, was 0 for 4 in his Cub debut.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 4, San Francisco 3--Phil Nevin homered leading off the
bottom of the ninth inning at San Diego, giving the Padres their
sixth win in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco starter Ryan Jensen, who began the game with 132/3
scoreless innings this season, had to leave after spraining his ankle
in the first inning.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds, who left Sunday's game against Milwaukee because of a
strained right hamstring, missed a home run by about 15 feet, hitting
a foul ball into the second deck in right field, and finished one for
three with an intentional walk.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 14, St. Louis 5--Luis Gonzalez drove in four runs, and
Damian Miller hit a three-run homer at Phoenix as the Diamondbacks
won their fifth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks scored six runs in the second and fourth to win
handily in the first meeting between the teams since Arizona's 2-1
victory in Game 5 of the NL division series last October.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 6, Milwaukee 1--Adrian Brown drove in three runs as the
Pirates beat the Brewers before the smallest crowd ever at
Milwaukee's Miller Park.</TE>
<TE>   The game drew 14,090 to the retractable-roof stadium, which opened
last year. The previous low was 23,311 on April 7 for the Brewers'
previous home game, the finale of a three-game series against
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee dropped to 3-10 for the first time since 1972.</TE>

<HD>Piazza, Alfonzo Lift Mets, 7-6</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Catcher hits two home runs, third baseman drives
in winning run in 12-inning win over Braves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The New York Met rally didn't fall short this time.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Piazza homered twice and third baseman Edgardo Alfonzo hit a
game-winning single in the 12th inning as the Mets came back from a
five-run deficit to defeat the Atlanta Braves, 7-6, Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   New York rallied from a 7-0 deficit Saturday against Montreal
before losing, 9-8, in 11 innings. The Mets completed the job this
time.</LD>
<TE>   "It's tough when you get down like that, especially against a team
like Atlanta," Piazza said. "But we've come back before and we
believe we're going to win these games."</TE>
<TE>   One day after Roberto Alomar homered twice with one of Piazza's
bats, the Met slugger did the same. Piazza hit solo shots in the
second and seventh innings, and the Mets scored five runs in the
seventh to tie the score, 6-6.</TE>
<TE>   New York won it in the 12th. Jay Payton, hitless in his first five
at-bats, singled with one out against Chris Hammond (0-1). After a
two-out walk to Piazza, Alfonzo hit a soft single to right-center off
Kevin Gryboski that scored Payton.</TE>
<TE>   "We play some good games against the Braves, it seems," Manager
Bobby Valentine said. "We know we can win ballgames no matter what
the score is."</TE>
<TE>   The Braves intentionally walked Alfonzo in the same situation in
the 10th inning to face Jeromy Burnitz. Hammond struck out Burnitz to
end the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox considered walking Alfonzo again, but
decided against it because Hammond was tiring after throwing 47
pitches.</TE>
<TE>   "He had had enough," Cox said. "He was great. But you can't expect
anymore than he did. I briefly thought about it, but it wasn't the
move."</TE>
<TE>   Gary Sheffield went 0 for 6 for the Braves.</TE>
<TE>   "I just felt like we were going to score in double digits today,"
Sheffield said. "But we didn't capitalize early and they capitalized
late. We're just not hitting on all cylinders."</TE>

<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Facing one of its toughest tests of the season, top-ranked Chatsworth
High (18-0, 4-0) rallied from a two-run deficit to defeat No. 11 Van
Nuys Birmingham, 5-3, Monday in a West Valley League baseball game at
Chatsworth.</LD>
<LD>   Joe Guntz (6-0) raised his career record to 31-0 by scattering
nine hits and outdueling Junior Garcia (6-1), one of two pitchers
over the last two seasons to defeat Chatsworth. Jordan Sisson hit a
two-run home run for the Chancellors.</LD>
<LD>   Birmingham (17-2, 3-1) took a 2-0 lead on Luis Parra's two-run
double in the fourth inning. Chatsworth tied the score in the fourth
on a run-scoring triple by Brett Munster and Ryan Barba's run-scoring
single.</LD>
<TE>   Brian Lee's sacrifice fly in the fifth gave Chatsworth a 3-2 lead.
Sisson's two-run home run in the sixth made it 5-2.</TE>
<TE>   Birmingham had the tying runs on base in the seventh when Guntz
got Raul Campos on a game-ending popout.</TE>

<LD>The high jump facility at Arcadia High, with its relatively small
approach area, isn't one that jumpers rave about.</LD>
<LD>   But it didn't prevent Kaylene Wagner of Goleta Dos Pueblos from
joining the exclusive 6-foot club in winning the Arcadia Invitational
on Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Wagner, who has signed with Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, added two
inches to her previous best when she cleared 6 feet on her first
attempt.</LD>
<TE>   The effort broke the school record of 5-10 1/2 set by Denise
Yamada in 1983, moved Wagner into a three-way tie for first on the
yearly national performer list and into a three-way tie for second on
the all-time Southern Section list.</TE>

<LD>A few years ago Dave Pasant, a retired insurance executive, bid
$6,000 at a charity auction for the opportunity to have his wife take
a ride in the pace car with Paul Newman at the big race in Long
Beach.</LD>
<LD>   "They were supposed to go around the track once," he said. "Five
laps later she still wasn't back."</LD>
<LD>   I've seen a picture of Dave Pasant.</LD>
<TE>   "Our marriage hasn't been the same since," Pasant said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT'S A good thing the guy was laughing, because I'm on my way to
Colorado today to spend time with the Dodgers and Kings, and I'm not
sure I could deal with another loser.</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, the guy's a real winner, bidding $76,000 two
years ago as a charitable donation to take a 10-lap ride in the
Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race. If he was looking for some kind of
death-defying thrill, I'd have let him drive with the wife to the
corner for next to nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Pasant, however, paid an additional $61,000 to ride in the same
race this past weekend, and donated another $65,000 for a spot in
next year's event. I buy 20 boxes of Girl Scout cookies every year
for the charitable write-off, because they also make great dog
biscuits for Ralphie, but I don't think I could come up with $200,000
in donations--even if I had the Salvation Army haul off every pair of
the wife's shoes.</TE>
<TE>   "Toyota has to put a perceived real-world value on the ride every
year, and that's what can be written off," Pasant said. "I think it's
around $23,000 or $24,000, or whatever the cost is for a totaled
car--and that's what they got back from me."</TE>
<TE>   That's right, Pasant spent $61,000 this past weekend for the
privilege of driving a modified Toyota Celica into a wall. "It was
either that, or taking out Dule Hill," said Pasant, and I presumed he
meant some kind of Long Beach landmark.</TE>
<TE>   "No, he plays the aide to the president on West Wing," Pasant
said, and you would think if a guy has to pay $61,000 to join a
celebrity race they would have some celebrities behind the wheel.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you talking about?" Pasant said. "I got the chance to
compete against Patrick Warburton, who was on TV in 'The Tick.' I
loved that show--all six episodes before they took it off the air."</TE>
<TE>   I would imagine it was Pasant's wife, Jill, who pulled a weapon on
Newman and had him driving as far as that pace car would go before
running out of fuel.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "I'M REALLY not that strange," said a 50-year-old Pasant. This was
after he had returned from his morning ukulele session with 75 senior
citizens and after mentioning he had donated $26,000 to charity to
acquire a helmet Mario Andretti wore in 1978. Imagine the
improvements they have made in helmets since then.</TE>
<TE>   "All the money goes to such a great cause--the Children's
Hospitals of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Orange County," he said. "I
joined all the celebrities for a visit to Children's Hospital before
Saturday's race, and we went into this one kid's room and you should
have seen how he lit up when he saw Bill Goldberg."</TE>
<TE>   If Goldberg walked into my house, I'd have had him arrested like
any other ugly stranger caught trespassing. That goes for Houston
Mitchell too, and while I know you've never heard of the guy, take my
word for it, you'd have him arrested too.</TE>
<TE>   "Goldberg's a wrestler," said Pasant in explaining why Goldberg is
ugly. "The kid had a huge WWF poster on his wall, and Bill was just
great with the child. And when he gave him a wrestling action figure,
well, right then and there that moment was worth every penny I've
spent on these races--the look on that kid's face.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it will add three days to that youngster's life," he said
before excusing himself for a moment to regain his composure. "That
guy has incredible appeal, and he was such a sweetheart with the
kids. I wish I could do something more.... "</TE>
<TE>   Winning, of course, is out of the question if you have seen him
drive. But it would be nice if he could use his influence and invite
some celebrities to compete in the Celebrity Race next year.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't mind bumping bumpers with Salma Hayek," he said, and
I'm not sure where the bidding would start, but for a good cause like
that, I'd want to help any way I could. I know there's a penalty for
dipping into your 401K, but it'd be for charity.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FORGET ABOUT the regular season. You put red jerseys on every one
of the Lakers once the playoffs start, and they wouldn't be much
different from Tiger Woods, who saves his best for the majors.</TE>
<TE>   I guess that makes the Trail Blazers kind of the Phil Mickelsons
of the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PLASCHKE WROTE a heartwarming note about Mickelson, who was
talking about "The Rookie," and how he could relate to the movie's
message. And here I've always thought of Mickelson as a "Tin Cup"
kind of guy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT WASN'T that long ago when the Dodgers were relying on F.P.
Santangelo to get them going. The Columbus Clippers released
Santangelo this weekend after he opened the season hitting .067 (one
for 15) in the team's first seven games. Tough to find someone who is
hitting worse than Tim Salmon, but I did.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Jimmy F:</TE>
<TE>   "Please note that in all the releases from the Chargers
organization, including their new business cards, they no longer are
referring to themselves as the San Diego Chargers--only the
'Chargers.' The move to L.A. is imminent."</TE>
<TE>   Probably with Santangelo starting at quarterback ... at least he
would be head-and-shoulders bigger than the guy they've got now.</TE>

<HD>Feeling Hip and Loving It</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A whistle, a blackboard, a returning quarterback--those are precious
gifts for a high school football coach.</LD>
<LD>   Darryl Stroh and Brent Newcomb have changed their perspective. A
new hip has soared to the top of their lists.</LD>
<LD>   Each is feeling revitalized after undergoing hip replacement
surgery. Instead of contemplating retirement, they're making plans to
continue coaching this fall and beyond.</LD>
<TE>   "My wife says I'm kinder, gentler and sexier," said Stroh, 63, who
has been coaching football off and on at Granada Hills High since
1963.</TE>
<TE>   He had double hip replacement surgery on Feb. 27 at Centinela
Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood. It has changed his life. The
daily pain from walking and even sitting is gone.</TE>
<TE>   "The pain was so bad I couldn't sleep at night," he said. "I've
had it for years. I can remember 20 years ago riding in a car and
being uncomfortable. It just got worse and worse. It's been
absolutely wonderful without the pain. It's unbelievable. I can't
believe I was living with that much discomfort and accepting it."</TE>
<TE>   Newcomb, 59, has a similar tale. He has been coaching football at
Antelope Valley High since 1969. His pain got so bad last season that
he refused to make the long walk to the locker room at halftime for
several games.</TE>
<TE>   "I sat on the bench and watched the halftime show," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On March 5, Newcomb had his left hip replaced by Dr. Domenic Sisto
of the Los Angeles Orthopedic Group. The surgery took a little more
than an hour. What a difference it has made.</TE>
<TE>   "The pain is gone," Newcomb said. "You have to be there to know
the feeling. It's almost immediate. They get you up and walk you the
first day."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 76er Coach Larry Brown had hip surgery. So did Duke
Coach Mike Krzyzewski. The surgery can extend careers and take away
years of pain.</TE>
<TE>   North Hollywood High golf Coach Steve Miller had double hip
replacement surgery seven years ago. He's so free from pain that he
plays lunchtime basketball, not to mention lots of golf.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great operation," said Dr. Lawrence Dorr, who performed
Stroh's surgery. "Not only does it achieve the medical goal of
getting rid of pain but allows [the patient] to achieve their social
goal, whether coaching football, dancing, playing golf."</TE>
<TE>   The pain becomes unbearable when cartilage wears down in the hip
joint, usually from degenerative arthritis. The diseased bone is
removed and a titanium ball is inserted in a plastic socket. The cost
for the surgery can be more than $20,000 for double hip replacement.</TE>
<TE>   "Life is too short to go around and feel miserable," Stroh said.
"I almost can't remember when I didn't have some discomfort. You
become very irritable."</TE>
<TE>   So now Stroh's former players understand why he yelled so much.
"Pain in the hip or pain in the butt, I don't know which one I was,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Stroh's current players already notice a difference in his
demeanor.</TE>
<TE>   "He's still passionate about football but seems a lot nicer,"
linebacker Joel Fitzgerald said. "I know he's still in some pain from
the hip surgery and if we get him mad, it will aggravate him more.
But it's good to have him back."</TE>
<TE>   Newcomb is entering his 25th year as head coach. His retirement
plans are on hold.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you get it in your blood, you go as long as you can," he
said. "I'm still having fun on Friday nights."</TE>
<TE>   Stroh will probably retire from teaching when he reaches 65, but
he wants to keep coaching football because his hip pain is gone.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a lovable guy now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And if his players believe that, they'll be running laps from dawn
until dusk when they mess up.</TE>
<TE>   As for Newcomb, he can't get away with claiming pain prevents him
from doing yard work</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I'm going to have to be a normal guy now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Pam, said she doesn't notice much difference.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the sweetest Teddy bear there is," she said. "He doesn't
talk much when he hurts. He just sucks it up."</TE>
<TE>   Stroh and Newcomb are ready to discard their canes and start
getting their teams ready for spring practice.</TE>
<TE>   And, if any metal detectors go off, don't panic. It's only their
new hips, functioning as designed.</TE>

<HD>More Mighty Promises</HD>
<DH>Analysis: Ducks' wait-till-next-year talk will come true
only if scoring and power play are improved in off-season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks are "close" to a Stanley Cup playoff team, as their
management has suggested this season. Their home ice is about 30
miles from Staples Center, where the Kings play.</LD>
<LD>   But as for the Ducks' own postseason hopes, another off-season has
come and the words from past off-seasons still hang in the air.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we're getting there and once we get there, we're going to
be there for a while. I think you'll see next season that we'll be
back, the fans will be back and the team will be strong."</LD>
<TE>   That's what Disney CEO Michael Eisner said two seasons ago in his
last public comment about the team he created.</TE>
<TE>   The fans aren't back. Tickets sold for Duck games dropped for the
fifth consecutive season to a franchise-low 492,088, lowest in the
NHL.</TE>
<TE>   The team is not strong. The Ducks finished 13th in the Western
Conference, 25 points out of a playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   And Eisner has refused all interview requests about a franchise
that has missed the playoffs seven of its nine seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Duck management, though, is already in wait-till-next-season form.
As in Oz, please ignore the 13th-place finish behind the curtain, and
merely listen to the Wizard.</TE>
<TE>   "It never happens this way, but if no team makes any changes
[during the off-season], if there was a rule that no one could make
changes, then I would say, 'Terrific,' because we'd make the playoffs
with this team," General Manager Pierre Gauthier said.</TE>
<TE>   He's right, of course. It never does happen that way, and there is
no such rule.</TE>
<TE>   The reality is that the Ducks were a respectable 15-13-2 in their
last 30 games. But playoff berths are earned over 82 games.</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Sebastien Giguere emerged as a talented young NHL goalie. And
the Ducks still finished 13th.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks allowed a franchise-low 198 goals. And they finished
13th.</TE>
<TE>   Center Matt Cullen and right wing Mike Leclerc made significant
strides. And the Ducks finished 13th.</TE>
<TE>   The penalty-killing unit finished seventh in the NHL. And the
Ducks finished 13th.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Carney gave backbone to a defense that gave up the
eighth-fewest goals in the NHL. German Titov played some quality
hockey. Andy McDonald developed into a legitimate NHL center.</TE>
<TE>   And the Ducks finished 13th.</TE>
<TE>   "We're basically a .500 club the last stretch, the last 30 games,
of the season," Gauthier said. "The team progressed."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it did. The Ducks didn't finish at the bottom of the
conference, as they did last season. But neither did they finish
ahead of Minnesota, a second-year expansion team, for the second
consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   "In this conference, you had to be 10 games over .500 to make the
playoffs," team captain Paul Kariya said.</TE>
<TE>   To close that gap is simple, and it's not: More goals.</TE>
<TE>   Only last-place Columbus scored fewer goals than the Ducks, who
scored two or fewer goals in 58 games.</TE>
<TE>   The Duck power play ranked last in the NHL. They lost 16 one-goal
games when they failed to score on the power play. They had five tie
games in which they didn't score on the power play.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't include two-goal games where, depending how the game
went, if you get a power-play goal it could swing the game around,"
Kariya said. "If you give us even an average power play, then we are
in the playoffs. That is what we have to address in the off-season."</TE>
<TE>   Easier said than done.</TE>
<TE>   Quality goal scorers are not exactly lying around waiting to be
picked up.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks are pinning some hopes on further development of Leclerc
and Cullen, each of whom had his career high in goals, as well as
Jeff Friesen and Steve Rucchin, who had another injury-marred season
and will undergo surgery this week to have pins removed from his left
ankle.</TE>
<TE>   But there seems to be a need for outside help.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say anything about the personnel, what we need and what
we don't need," Coach Bryan Murray said. "I know that if we're going
to make up 25 points [in the standings], we need to score more."</TE>
<TE>   There are potential unrestricted free agents. Among them are
Chicago's Tony Amonte, Boston's Bill Guerin and San Jose's Teemu
Selanne--can you imagine Selanne and Kariya on a line together?</TE>
<TE>   A trade is an option. But any deal could open a larger hole
elsewhere with the depth-challenged Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't have to be one player, it could be more than one
addition," Gauthier said. "We'll look at all areas of player
procurement. When you talk free agency, that's a very risky, very
costly situation. Every year, around the league, it's a box of
surprises.</TE>
<TE>   "You have 30 teams trying to find scoring. We could draft players
who could help immediately. Or it may be some of our European
players."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' best European player is at least two years off. Russian
forward Stanislav Christov must complete another year of military
service--barring some financial arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   This year's draft, Gauthier said, is not very deep. Nor do the
Ducks have a good history of picking players who can help
immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Still, nothing seems so optimistic as a Duck off-season.</TE>
<TE>   "You have 30 teams that want to make the playoffs," Gauthier said.
"That's quite a challenge in our own division. But we feel better now
about our chances than we did the last couple years."</TE>

<HD>Tiger Factor Helps CBS</HD>

<LD>Even though there was little drama, the Tiger Woods factor came into
play with television ratings for Sunday's final round of the Masters.
CBS drew a solid 9.9 national overnight rating and 21 share of the
audience. The Los Angeles numbers were even better--10.1 with a 28
share.</LD>
<LD>   Although the 9.9/21 was down from last year's national overnight
of 12.1/25, the main reason was the coverage was expanded from three
hours to more than five. Sunday marked the first time CBS has covered
all 18 holes. The rating for the final three hours of coverage Sunday
was about the same as last year.</LD>
<LD>   Overnight ratings reflect only those from metered major markets.
Final national ratings will be out later in the week.</LD>
<TE>   The average overnight for the final two rounds was an 8.8/19. The
only times the Masters has drawn a better two-day average also came
in years that Woods won--a 12.8/27 in 1997 and a 10.5/23 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's coverage peaked with a 14.1 between 3 and 3:30 p.m. In
L.A., the peak rating was a 12.9.</TE>

<HD>Israel's Tripwire Is Up North</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>YOSSI KLEIN HALEVI</AU>
<BD>Yossi Klein Halevi is the Israeli correspondent for the
New Republic and a senior writer for the Jerusalem Report.</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin Powell's mission to the Middle East has
already accomplished one essential thing: It has focused world
attention on the fundamentalist Hezbollah's provocations along the
Israel-Lebanon border.</LD>
<LD>   Israel's conflict with the Palestinians creates misery and
disaster for both sides. But the conflict with Hezbollah, which is
armed and controlled by Iran and Syria, could escalate into the next
Middle East war. The real danger to regional stability won't come
from Ramallah but southern Lebanon, which borders Israel's Galilee.</LD>
<LD>   For months, Hezbollah terrorists have fired not only at Israeli
soldiers stationed on Mount Dov or the Shabaa Farms--a forlorn
hilltop without farms that is claimed by both Lebanon and Israel--but
have shot at Israeli aircraft in Israeli airspace, causing shrapnel
to fall over Galilee towns.</LD>
<TE>   When Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon two years ago, the
United Nations marked the border and declared that Israel had
fulfilled its obligations under international law. Yet the U.N. has
almost completely ignored Hezbollah's violation of the border it
established.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Hezbollah's attacks dangerously escalated. Two
terrorists crossed the border and ambushed Israeli cars on a lonely
northern road, killing seven people. The event was reported abroad as
one more terror attack against Israel, lost in the blur of
Palestinian atrocities. Still, this attack was different: For the
first time since Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon, terrorists had
violated the international border to murder civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Israel repeatedly has warned that it will hold Syria responsible
for attacks coming from Lebanon. Syria, after all, unofficially
occupies the country and determines its foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   So far, though, Israel has refrained from striking Syrian
installations, wary of opening a second front while its army fights
an anti-terrorist offensive in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   But Israel won't be able to continue absorbing attacks
indefinitely. Every attack that goes unanswered only reinforces the
disastrous perception in the Arab world of Israeli weakness, created
by Israel's hasty retreat from Lebanon in May 2000.</TE>
<TE>   That retreat, under Hezbollah fire, inspired the Palestinians to
adopt what they called the "Hezbollah option"--the notion that the
best way to secure territory from Israel isn't through negotiation
but violence.</TE>
<TE>   Hezbollah plays a key role in the emerging terrorist axis that
includes Iran, Iraq and the Palestinian Authority. It was Hezbollah
operatives, for example, who helped organize the Iranian-supplied
arms ship, Karine A, which Israel intercepted on its way to Gaza. The
Karine A cargo included several tons of powerful C4 explosives,
enough to equip hundreds of car bombs and suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   If Powell fails to pressure Damascus to rein in Hezbollah, an
Israeli-Syrian confrontation is almost certain.</TE>
<TE>   Many Lebanese, desperate to free their country from the Syrian
occupation, are probably hoping that will happen. And with the
international community apathetic to Lebanon's transformation into a
colony of Damascus, an Israeli strike at Syria could be a free
Lebanon's last hope.</TE>
<TE>   As I write this Monday night, the siren for Memorial Day,
commemorating the 21,000 soldiers who fell in the nation's wars, has
just sounded across Israel. The songs on the radio have turned
elegiac; television programming on this day is devoted exclusively to
the stories of fallen soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   This is a nation that craves peace. Yet the disastrous Oslo
process--which created Yasser Arafat's government and armed his
terrorist militias--taught us that generosity is often perceived in
the Middle East as weakness and rewarded with aggression and
terrorism. And so, as much as Israelis despise war, we're ready to
fight those who want to destroy us.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the Palestinians learned a lesson from Hezbollah
and then launched the intifada. Now it's time for Hezbollah to learn
a lesson from the Palestinians: When you push Israel too hard, you're
likely to suffer the consequences.</TE>

<HD>Create Work Policies Fit for a Mom</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HALPERN</AU>
<BD>Diane Halpern is a professor of psychology and director
of the Berger Institute for Work, Family and Children at Claremont
McKenna College.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can women have it all? The answer depends on the definition of "all."</LD>
<LD>   In her headline-grabbing book, "Creating a Life: Professional
Women and the Quest for Children," economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett
delivers some bad news: Nearly half of professional women are
childless at 40. She tells sad stories about chief executives,
politicians and lawyers who yearn to be mothers but somehow "forgot"
to have children as they climbed the ladders promising success. These
tearful stories lead to the conclusion that women who work hard
establishing careers during the first half of their lives will be
repaid only with childlessness and regrets in the second half.</LD>
<LD>   But Hewlett overlooks the more than half of the women in
high-powered careers who have had children, as well as those who have
decided not to. And although we tend to think that high-level
professionals have unique work- related stresses, low-wage earners
are no less stressed when it comes to making ends meet. They often
work overtime or take on second jobs, endure long commutes on public
transportation and may not have the "luxury" of paying for health
insurance or the household help that's affordable to higher-paid
professionals.</LD>
<TE>   Approximately 70% of mothers with school-age children work for pay
outside the home, with experiences that fly in the face of the
conclusion that it is almost impossible to combine motherhood and
work. Difficult? Definitely. Tiring? Absolutely. But it is the
reality for most women.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line is that biology is an equal-opportunity science.
For all women, biological clocks run in the same time zone as tenure
and other career path clocks. Timeouts for maternity leaves or
child-care duties are needed during the early years of most women's
careers, and women pay dearly. But the reduction in lifetime earnings
for mothers who disrupt their careers for family is reimbursed with a
life with the precious child. Not a bad deal.</TE>
<TE>   So must we leave it at that? Not necessarily. Young men and women
need help with life planning. They need to understand how sharply
women's fertility rates fall after age 35. They need to know that
delayed childbearing is unhealthy for mothers and their children and
that the decision to postpone a family may ultimately be the decision
to not have a family.</TE>
<TE>   The current worker norm is based on a model family that is nearly
extinct: a dedicated company man with a stay-at-home wife to care for
the children or elderly parents while tending to endless appointments
with cable installers, termite inspectors and other service workers.
The new worker norms should allow more options for flexible work
schedules, telecommuting, child-care assistance, quality part-time
careers, job sharing.</TE>
<TE>   It is simply good business to provide work options that reduce
absenteeism and tardiness, increase worker commitment and reduce
employee turnover rates, not to mention reducing the costs to hire
and train new personnel.</TE>
<TE>   We should investigate ways to reduce backlash against
family-friendly work policies so that employers and nonparent
employees understand the strong business case that is supported by
these policies. We also need to end the tendency to attribute to
working mothers all the ailments of society. Fathers, schools,
culture and children themselves also contribute to everyday problems.</TE>
<TE>   Fathers and nonparents as well would benefit from a broader range
of family-friendly policies, which would allow them to meet their
responsibilities and pursue their own interests. We can redesign how
we work so that more women and men can create full lives, which
include careers and kids.</TE>

<HD>A Texas Tale Exposes Drug War Abuses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIANNA HUFFINGTON</AU>
<BD>Arianna Huffington is a syndicated columnist. E-mail:
arianna @ariannaonline.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever heard of Tulia? It's a little town in Texas that was the scene
of one of the most shameful miscarriages of justice in modern
American history--a highly questionable undercover drug sting that in
the summer of 1999 led to the arrest of one in six of the town's
African American population.</LD>
<LD>   And now the dismissal of charges last week against Tonya White,
one of the final two of the original 43 Tulia defendants, has kicked
wide open the door on the dubious nature of the entire Tulia
operation while exposing one of the many shadowy corners of the drug
war: the power and abuses of drug task forces.</LD>
<LD>   White was freed only after her lawyers uncovered a bank deposit
slip that proved she was in Oklahoma City, 300 miles from Tulia, at
the time she was alleged to have sold cocaine to Tom Coleman, the
controversial undercover cop whose uncorroborated testimony was the
sole basis for the Tulia roundup.</LD>
<TE>   Since the bust, Coleman's credibility has come under withering
fire. Branded a "compulsive liar" by former co-workers, Coleman was
arrested for theft in the middle of the Tulia operation but,
amazingly, was still allowed to continue his undercover work. And the
prosecution continued to trust him and rely on his word even after it
was proved that he had perjured himself on the stand.</TE>
<TE>   But this story is about more than one small town and one bad cop.
It's about drug task forces allowed to run wild. There are an
estimated 1,000 of these autonomous special units operating
nationwide. They came into widespread use in the 1980s as a way of
combating the nation's growing drug problem but have morphed into the
rampaging mad dogs of the drug war, operating with little oversight
or accountability.</TE>
<TE>   Reports of their questionable tactics--particularly the use of
unreliable informants and a disturbing focus on poor, black drug
users rather than big-time dealers--are widespread.</TE>
<TE>   And it's taxpayer money that is paying for this wave of abuse,
through a federal grant program that has distributed billions of
dollars to drug task forces. This grant money is tied to the number
of busts a task force makes--the more arrests made, the more money
received. The result is a law enforcement mind-set that elevates raw
numbers over justice.</TE>
<TE>   Combined with draconian asset forfeiture laws, the money-for-
arrest model has turned avaricious cops into drug war entrepreneurs,
all too willing to bend the rules in exchange for more money and
power.</TE>
<TE>   Task force cops have even started talking like businessmen.
Witness this Wall Street-flavored assessment from one Texas task
force's quarterly report: "Highway seizures were off a bit this
quarter, but crack sales are still strong."</TE>
<TE>   The more you look into drug task forces, the more you realize that
the shoddy police work exhibited in Tulia--shady narc, iffy suspect
IDs, a lack of corroborating evidence--is more the norm than an
aberration. But despite the mountain of doubt raised about Coleman,
Tulia prosecutor Terry McEachern continues to stand by his narc,
dismissing Coleman's lies about White as a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   In reality, it's a smoking gun. One that Jeff Blackburn, who
represented White, hopes will ultimately lead to the overturning of
the other Tulia convictions. To that end, he has created the Tulia
Legal Defense Project and is about to mount a campaign to get Texas
Gov. Rick Perry to pardon those convicted in the Tulia sting.</TE>
<TE>   Blackburn's efforts have drawn support from a number of national
organizations, including the National Assn. for the Advancement of
Colored People, the American Bar Assn. and the William Moses Kunstler
Fund for Racial Justice.</TE>
<TE>   Perry should join them and pardon the Tulia defendants. And the
rest of us should take a harder look at the abuses being perpetrated
in the name of the war on drugs.</TE>

<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD>Robert Scheer writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What is the fundamental difference between Slobodan Milosevic and
Ariel Sharon? The former is on trial for war crimes, while the latter
still leads an occupying army.</LD>
<LD>   For those already loosing angry e-mails from their quivers, I ask
you to take a few minutes to consider the comparison before rushing
to defend Sharon's scorched-earth march through the West Bank as a
necessary response to the terrorists that Yasser Arafat either
condones or has been too gutless to stop.</LD>
<LD>   Milosevic, like Sharon, cited the terror tactics of neighboring
peoples--Croatians, Bosnians and ethnic Albanians who stood in the
way of his vision of a secure Yugoslavia--as a rationale for
preemptive use of massive military force against them.</LD>
<TE>   An occupied people can get ugly in their resistance, unless a
near-saint such as Mohandas Gandhi or Nelson Mandela leads the
movement away from mayhem while winning political victories. Arafat
is anything but a saint, and there is much blood on his hands. But it
is always the occupier, with the big guns and control of the real
estate, that holds the real keys to reconciliation.</TE>
<TE>   Rarely does such an occupation end voluntarily; land is exchanged
for peace only when the occupiers feel there is no other choice. Both
the plan laid out by former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell and the recent
Saudi-inspired Arab League peace proposal offered such an option, but
Sharon would not accept it anymore than Milosevic would the
compromises presented to him up to the end of the Yugoslavia wars.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, both have sought to destroy any momentum toward peace by
waging war.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has humiliated President Bush, not only by ignoring his
demand for a withdrawal but by co-opting the president's
war-on-terrorism code phrases as cover for his drive to
prevent--forever, if possible--a Palestinian state. How simple it
would be if only the "axis of evil" targeted civilians, but from
Saddam Hussein to Hamas to Sharon, nobody in the Mideast
conflagration has a monopoly on such cruelty.</TE>
<TE>   By blasting through West Bank towns, possibly burying children in
their wake, the once-proud Israel Defense Forces is heading down
toward the moral level of suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever is ultimately discovered about the carnage committed by
Israel's forces, enough is known to implicate Sharon for a form of
ethnic cleansing--purposefully destroying the Palestinians' ability
to govern themselves. The systematic destruction of the signposts of
nascent Palestinian statehood--statistics bureaus, education
ministries, electricity and water supplies--is aimed at further
uprooting a refugee population.</TE>
<TE>   Despite stereotypes, Serbs did not start out as oppressive
occupiers any more than did Israelis; both their peoples suffered
terribly during World War II and sought peace within secure borders.
However, the historical insecurity of both peoples has led them into
the role of oppressor, feeding a cycle of resistance and repression.</TE>
<TE>   This is the opposite of what the idealistic Zionists who founded
Israel had in mind. They always knew that the ultimate test of the
new state would not be merely its ability to survive but rather its
ability to survive with democratic values intact.</TE>
<TE>   Almost 70% of Israel's officer corps in the 1967 Six-Day War had
been raised in the idealism of the kibbutz movement. They deemed
justice a universal right--even for Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, an Arab world that long refused to accept and guarantee
Israel's right to exist did much to kill that idealism. Yet Israel's
decision to keep the captured territories has ultimately boomeranged,
drastically undermining its democracy and stability.</TE>
<TE>   "If Israel does not find the way to disengage from the
Palestinians, its future might resemble the experience of Belfast or
Bosnia--two communities bleeding each other to death for
generations," said former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak this week
in an op-ed article. "Alternatively, if we do not disengage from the
Palestinians, Israel might drift toward an apartheid state."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, under the heavy hand of Barak's successor Israel
already is an apartheid state. This may be what Sharon and Arafat
prefer to the Camp David compromise, but it represents the deepest
betrayal of the interests of both the Palestinians and Jews.</TE>

<HD>Health Crisis: Now, Action</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The problem of California's 7 million people without health insurance
has been talked to death. In a nutshell: Americans 65 and older
receive health care through the federal Medicare program. Other
government programs including Medicaid--known in California as
Medi-Cal--and Healthy Families cover the very poor and disabled and
some children from working families. Left out are the working poor
themselves. Eight in 10 Californians without insurance have jobs or
come from families with at least one person employed but earn too
little to buy insurance and too much to qualify for government
programs. A new set of possible solutions is on the table and
shouldn't be shelved without action.</LD>
<LD>   A year ago the state health department called for new ideas for
providing health care to the one in four Californians who has no
coverage. Health-care advocacy groups and professors from UCLA, UC
San Diego, UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco proposed remedies. A
series of statewide public hearings on nine proposals ended Friday in
Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   The Health Care Options Project tells us there is a way--there are
at least nine ways--to expand health care coverage. The project
directors will submit their report to the Legislature and the
governor next month.</LD>
<TE>   Our elected officials should resist the easy path of clucking
sympathetically and then leaving the report to gather dust. The
problem can't be fixed all at once, but as the federally assisted
Healthy Families program has shown, fixing it is not impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the proposed reforms would tweak programs already in
place. Proportionally, California is last among the states in the
number of residents with job-based health insurance, and one plan
would increase incentives to small employers to offer health
insurance. Another, already introduced as Assembly Bill 32, by
Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge) and Sen. Liz Figueroa
(D-Fremont), would combine and expand the existing Healthy Families
and the Medi-Cal programs. Three call for major overhauls that would
provide universal coverage under a single-payer system.</TE>
<TE>   Fixing the health care system is going to cost money, but not
fixing it also has costs. Somebody pays when people without insurance
seek help. Hospitals with already strained profit margins are forced
to eat expenses. Emergency rooms shut down, putting insured and
uninsured alike at risk. Costs get passed on through higher insurance
premiums. The risk from infectious diseases rises.</TE>
<TE>   We don't know which proposal or which combination of these would
work best. What we do know is that California can do better than
leaving millions of its working-poor families without health care
coverage.</TE>

<LD>Weeks of escalating mayhem in Israel and the occupied territories
made for overwhelming odds against Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
bringing sudden peace to the region. Yet he has spurred concessions
that we hope will have a subtle cooling effect--which would be a
small but significant success in that roiling inferno.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, unfortunately, has been his
usual recalcitrant self, attacking Israeli "massacres and blood baths
plaguing our people." But he did belatedly condemn "violent
operations that target Israeli civilians," including Friday's
Jerusalem suicide bombing that killed six Israelis and injured scores
more at an outdoor market. That landed him a meeting with Powell, who
had made such a statement a prerequisite.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has defied U.S. demands that
Israel stop its military offensive against cities in the occupied
territories, but Monday he told President Bush he planned to pull
troops and tanks out of Jenin and Nablus in a week or less.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier, Sharon suggested holding a regional peace conference--so
long as Arafat did not attend. That condition is unacceptable to
Palestinians and their Arab allies. There are ways around the
problem, however, such as convening a meeting for lower-level
diplomats.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians say Israeli troops have committed atrocities and
killed hundreds in Jenin. Israelis put the death toll in the dozens
and say the offensive is part of Israel's fight for existence. Both
sides, no doubt, are wielding the powerful weapon of propaganda. But
on that front, Israel has blundered. By aggressively keeping
reporters out of the battle zones, in some cases at gunpoint, it has
assured rising suspicion and the declining sympathy that invariably
accompanies such distrust.</TE>
<TE>   It is clear that Israel's door-to-door searches, bulldozing of
houses and rocket attacks on refugee camps have injured or killed an
unknown number of Palestinian civilians and created many new
Palestinian enemies. Soldiers searching for armed guerrillas
protected by inhabitants of overcrowded cities may be quick on the
trigger, especially when their comrades have been killed by booby
traps, as happened in Jenin last week. But residents say Israeli
soldiers shot unarmed civilians and knocked down houses with owners
inside.</TE>
<TE>   That is not to equate army attacks with terrorism by suicide
bombers. But the distinction will be lost if it turns out that
Israel, which has long prided itself on its defense forces'
professionalism, kills indiscriminately too. Thanks to Sharon's
orders, there were few if any independent witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Visiting Syria and Lebanon Monday, Powell warned that guerrilla
attacks on northern Israel could expand the conflict. Indeed the
stakes are high. Now, if he could get Israel to withdraw from the
occupied cities, it would be a step toward securing the northern
border. Getting the Palestinians to heed Arafat's condemnation of
violence would be a step toward a political solution to the conflict.</TE>

<LD>The economy is barely out of recession and the federal budget is
going into the red. But that isn't stopping President Bush and the
House leadership from pushing the tax cut button. Last year, Congress
approved Bush's $1.3-trillion tax cut, which is scheduled to expire
at the end of 2010. The expiration date was what kept the cuts from
being total budget busters in decades to come and made it possible
for moderate Democrats to join in a yes vote. Now, with Americans
still smarting from the pain of April 15, House Majority Leader J.
Dennis Hastert is set to demand Wednesday that the tax cuts,
including complete elimination of inheritance taxes, become
permanent.</LD>
<LD>   In exchange for big benefits to the richest taxpayers, these
permanent cuts would jeopardize Social Security and Medicare and
radically worsen the federal deficit.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration is greatly expanding government spending
to accommodate the war on terrorism; in March, the House passed a
resolution for a $2.1-trillion budget that would leave a $45-billion
deficit. Making the tax cut permanent would increase projected
deficits by an additional $397 billion from 2003 to 2012, according
to the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.</LD>
<TE>   Far worse would come farther down the road. The tax cut package,
if made permanent, would cost approximately $4 trillion in the decade
after 2012. That is the very moment when baby boomers will begin
retiring and drawing on Social Security and Medicare. In fact, the $4
trillion would entirely fund about 11 years of Social Security
expenses at the current spending rate. Yet these cuts, when in full
effect, would benefit mostly the top 1% of taxpayers, who as a group
would receive twice as much from the cuts as the bottom 60%. The
average yearly cut for the top 1% by 2010 is $53,123; for the bottom
60% it is $347.</TE>
<TE>   This package was bad enough when it was passed originally.
Ideally, it should be revisited by Congress and trimmed back, not
extended. But House Republicans are hoping for ammunition to let them
accuse the Democratic-controlled Senate of blocking tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   To add to the embarrassment of Senate Democrats, the Republicans
are planning to attach to their tax bill the widely popular and
sensible proposal known as the Taxpayer Protection and Accountability
Act. That, you may remember, was the measure voted down last week
after a shameless attempt by House leaders to use it as a vehicle to
weaken campaign reform.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what parliamentary tricks the GOP leaders employ this
time, the tax cut extension is another cynical ploy dressed as
lawmaking. As with the assault on campaign reform, voters will no
doubt see through it and applaud those who block it.</TE>

<LD>Re " 'They Forced Me to Hate,' " April 15: If anyone "made" the
Palestinians hate the Israelis, it was their own leaders, by not
doing right by them and feeding them the hate-filled propaganda for
which the Arab press is infamous.</LD>
<LD>   Your article barely touches on the fact that civilians are
involved because they harbor the terrorists who are murdering
civilians in Israel either voluntarily or by force. The Palestinian
Authority and its various militant factions have no compunction about
forcing civilians to operate as their human shields, as well as hide
armaments in homes, schools, offices and other normally civilian
environments. I suppose Israel should be expected to do what no other
government, including our own, tolerates: doing nothing while its
civilians are being randomly murdered.</LD>

<TE>   After reading the stories of Israeli actions in Jenin and other
areas of Palestine, I am realizing that the lessons of the Nazis were
not lost on the Israeli government. Summary executions, destruction
of your enemy's homes and livelihoods, rounding up all men aged 18 to
45 and blocking outside media and government access to your actions
could be a page out of 1930s Germany. Too bad the Israelis learned
the wrong lessons.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Put Some Bite Into a 'Land for Peace' Deal," Commentary, April
14: Russell Korobkin points out that Israel needs some guarantee of
peace as part of any land-for-peace agreement. He also points out
that the Palestinians cannot provide such a guarantee. He proposes
that in place of a guarantee Israel be allowed to "reoccupy portions
of the territories if the Palestinians fail to provide the peace they
promise." That's exactly what happens now. It isn't working.</TE>
<TE>   To make a land-for-peace deal stick, the entire Arab world must
provide the guarantee. The most civilized way would be an Arab-funded
insurance policy: For every Israeli killed by an Arab terrorist, the
insurance fund will pay the victim's family, say, $25 million--with
lesser amounts going to those injured but not killed. Public payments
by Arabs to Israelis will quickly reduce the sense of pride now felt
by the perpetrators of terrorism. If Saudi Arabia really wants peace,
let it be the first to fund such a land-for-peace insurance plan.</TE>

<TE>   While he made many good points, Korobkin's conclusion was, "To
convince Israel to cede land the Palestinians must guarantee peace."
The Israelis have no land to "cede." They are occupying land captured
in war that doesn't belong to them. Once the Israelis realize their
dreams of conquest and subjugation of the Palestinian people will not
be realized, they will withdraw and we will have peace. I am ever
hopeful this will occur soon.</TE>

<TE>   Does anyone truly believe that Israel will eventually agree to the

would have the right, even the obligation, to create a standing army

helicopter and equipped soldier for equipped soldier. Not in a

<TE>   On Friday morning, while watching the carnage of another suicide
bombing in Jerusalem that killed at least six people and wounded 50,
I read your editorial alleging that legislation I am considering, but
have not yet introduced, is "reckless." This legislation would
declare the Palestinian Liberation Organization a terrorist
organization and sanction it accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the recent attacks have been carried out by groups closely
affiliated with the PLO, such as the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade,
recently designated by the State Department as a foreign terrorist
organization, and the Tanzim. These are parts of Yasser Arafat's own
military apparatus.</TE>
<TE>   On April 10, eight people were killed in a suicide bombing in
Haifa. During the Passover week, 46 Israelis were killed and more
than 120 wounded. And in March alone, 125 Israelis were killed in the
attacks, which culminated in the bombing of the Passover ceremony in
Netanya. In sum, there have been at least 60 suicide bombings in
Israel since the new intifada began in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and I have deliberately held our
legislation in abeyance to give Secretary of State Colin Powell time
to revive the peace process. We hope he is successful. Is that
reckless?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I was relieved after reading both "Cop Will Not Face Charges in
Death" (April 11) and your story last fall, "Slaying by Officer Is
Ruled Justified" (Oct. 23), for many reasons. One of the first things
you learn when you are connected with firearms is that there is no
such thing as an "unloaded" or "fake" gun. There is no way that a cop
can tell the difference in that split second of decision.</LD>
<LD>   More than anything else, every cop dreads that situation, and the
short nanosecond he has to save--or lose--his own life with his own
reaction; or how he would react if the situation ever came up, as it
did with LAPD Officer Tarriel Hopper. So Hopper, a good cop, reacted
the only way a cop can--he saved his own life.</LD>
<LD>   The LAPD's review board and the district attorney's office both
made the right decision. Hopper acted in the proper manner. And what
happened at that fateful Halloween party was tragic.</LD>
<TE>   I knew Hopper as an all-American at Carson High and as a player at
USC. He played for me in the local Shrine game; he made an inspiring
speech for me at a Pop Warner banquet to a roomful of 13-year-olds.
Hopper is a good person and a good cop.</TE>

<TE>   If I were to go out and shoot my neighbor in the leg, I would be
arrested for attempted murder. Here you have a cop who says his life
was in danger from a man who was at a costume party and whose back
was turned away from the officer when he was shot four times. That's
justifiable homicide?</TE>
<TE>   This whole nation is slowly becoming a police state. Even Margaret
Mitchell, a homeless old woman brandishing a screwdriver, is shot and
killed. Another justifiable homicide.</TE>
<TE>   When I was on the force in New York, the first thing you learned
was self-defense using a baton. I knew officers in New York who had
been on the force for 20 years and never drew their weapon--but you'd
better not run from them. Their use of the baton was amazing.</TE>

<HD>Valley: Self-Governance Will Secede or Fail</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the early 20th century, a simple majority of landowners and
developers in the San Fernando Valley voted for annexation to Los
Angeles. Now a majority citywide must approve Valley secession and
the right of Valley residents to form their own city ("Secessionists
Are Next on Mayors Fight Card," April 11).</LD>
<LD>   In the 1950s, part of northern Burbank seceded from Los Angeles
without fanfare or a citywide vote. What changed? Why is the process
so complicated and politicized? What happened to the right of
self-determination?</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If the Valley succeeds in secession, many new top city jobs will
be created. I would volunteer to be mayor, but I suppose that
position has already been spoken for. However, if I could get my
Sherman Oaks to secede from the Valley, maybe I could be mayor of
that heavenly place. But if I lose that election, maybe I could get
my subdivision of Chandler Estates to divorce itself from Sherman
Oaks, and I'd surely be the mayor of that domain. Oh well.</TE>
<TE>   Corporations merge for efficiency, but if divesting makes for
better government, maybe we should divide the whole nation in two at
the Mason-Dixon line--and call them the North and the South.</TE>

<LD>Re "Accusations Fly Over Arctic Refuge Video," April 12: That the
Department of the Interior often functions like a press agent for Big
Oil should surprise no one. Its latest adventure in industry PR is
the distribution of an industry-backed propaganda video trying to
make the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, "America's Serengeti,"
appear lifeless and sterile.</LD>
<LD>   The video portrays the refuge in the dead of winter, when industry
contends that most of the work will be done and when wildlife
activity is less--and less visible. But the fact is that impacts are
year-round, and it is deceitful to pretend otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   The network of roads and pipelines serving the scattered wells and
other related development will have a major impact on this
biologically fecund treasure.</LD>
<TE>   This is something that the U.S. Geological Survey admitted in a
recently released and years-in-the-making study that Interior
Secretary Gale Norton ordered revised in a week. So much for relying
on sound science.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, it must sound good to oil companies in order to be
considered sound by the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   Norton, protege of the notorious former Interior Secretary James
Watt, is making her mentor proud. He could hardly outdo her in fealty
to industrial interests and willingness to mislead the public.</TE>

<LD>Re "U.S. Lawyer Accused of Aiding Imprisoned Cleric in Terror Plot,"
April 10: After reading about attorney Lynne F. Stewart and her
representation of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the convicted terrorist, I
have to ask the burning question: Is this lawyer, by virtue of the
accusations of passing communications to the Islamic Group, a
co-conspirator in terrorism? And if so, should one ask: Where do we
have to draw the line of lawyer-client confidential communication?</LD>
<LD>   The bitter irony to all of this is that she and her client will be
protected by our Constitution and our system of justice. Some other
lawyer will probably get her off.</LD>
<LD>   This is very hard for me to understand, let alone swallow.</LD>

<TE>   Re Stewart: I can't help but think I'm watching history unfold for
future social studies classes. This is a case for the textbooks: the
Justice Department versus the Constitution. Hollywood can't do better
than this.</TE>
<TE>   For all you historians, I think the big picture is even more
interesting.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Magna Carta, the trend has been to govern only with the
consent of the governed. We've seen monarchies evolve into
democracies. Having reached a peak in the cycle, with the African
independence movement, we accept a gradual return to the equivalent
of monarchies. I wish I could come back in a hundred years and
witness the signing of a second Magna Carta.</TE>

Sen. Dianne Feinstein's (D-Calif.) bill is heartening to us who have
Parkinson's disease. Sen. Sam Brownback's (R-Kan.) opposing bill is
delaying (with heart-rending results) the push for the cure. When
science lets genies out of the bottle, a nation of laws has options
on how to control them.</LD>
<LD>   We got it right with chemical weapons and nuclear power plants.
Instead of shutting down chemistry and physics labs, we outlawed
weapons and we regulated power plants more carefully. The FDA
controls the availability of medicines from other countries until it
tests them. It would be nothing new to have similar public oversight
of regenerative medicine. It offers a bright promise for our future.</LD>

<HD>Father's Memorial Vigil Cut Short</HD>
<DH>Camarillo: Man says he'll comply with the county's order to
remove roadside shrine to his teen daughter, who was killed when hit
by a car.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Camarillo man who kept a daily vigil at the Santa Rosa Road site
where his daughter died four months ago was ordered Monday to remove
the growing collection of candles, fading flowers and photographs.</LD>
<LD>   Although he does not agree with the decision delivered by mail
last week and in person Monday, Paul Bonds said he would comply with
the order from Butch Britt, Ventura County's deputy director of
public works.</LD>
<LD>   "I guess they are bigger and stronger than we are," said Bonds,
who has spent nearly every afternoon at the site along the busy
two-lane county road since December. "I'm still grieving, but I'm
grieving for the next child to be killed."</LD>
<TE>   Joined by his 26-year-old son, Paul Jr., and several neighbors,
Bonds spent Monday afternoon loading up the items left in his
daughter's memory by her friends and hauling them to his house a few
blocks away. But a small cross left in the soft dirt will remain.</TE>
<TE>   "The white cross is going to stay," said Bonds, 53. "They are
going to have to take it down and make a statement. If the community
puts it back up, they will put it back up. What can I say?"</TE>
<TE>   The software programmer's 14-year-old daughter, Jennifer, was
killed in December when she was struck by a car while the two jogged
along a section of Santa Rosa Road near their home. The driver was
not at fault in the accident, police said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Bonds was a popular student at Camarillo High School and
a member of the cross-country team. Stunned family members and
friends began the memorial with a few flower displays and some lit
candles.</TE>
<TE>   Four months later, the display has grown to include dozens of
photographs, poems and laminated newspaper clippings. Classmates of
the student athlete are regular visitors to the site, which sits on a
patch of dirt and grass about 16 feet from the busy roadway.</TE>
<TE>   The site has also served as a rallying point for Bonds and others
who say that cars speed down the two-lane county road well above the
posted 55-mph limit.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds is on a panel of Santa Rosa Valley residents studying ways
to improve safety on the road. The panel's recommendations are
expected in six months.</TE>
<TE>   Britt sent a letter to Bonds last week warning him to take the
display down or risk having "the encroachment removed by county
forces." He also could have faced a misdemeanor fine of $1,000 and
six months in jail, a county lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have received complaints that people gathered at the
accident site have come dangerously close to getting hit by cars
themselves, Britt said.</TE>
<TE>   Monday, the nine-year veteran of the county's public works
department said it was the first time in his 35-year career that he
had to send out an order to remove a roadside memorial. "This is a
pretty emotional issue, and I can understand that," Britt said.</TE>
<TE>   Britt remains open to putting up a permanent memorial at the site
that is set back from the road.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds also could buy a permanent sign that would include his
daughter's name, Britt said. Currently, there are two such signs in
the county. One honoring Oxnard Police Officer James O'Brien stands
on Victoria Avenue near where he was shot to death in 1993 after a
pursuit. Another was recently placed on a section of Lewis Road in
Camarillo where 54-year-old Menashi Khazoom was struck and killed as
he pedaled his bicycle in January.</TE>
<TE>   Britt said a decision on the appropriateness of a permanent cross
at the site had not been made but it may be illegal because of the
constitutional separation of church and state.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not in the memorial business, we're in the road business,"
Britt said. "I'm not insensitive, but I have got to enforce whatever
the rules and regulations are."</TE>

<HD>County Budget Plan Includes Service Cuts</HD>
<DH>Finances: Sheriff's and other public safety departments are
targeted as the state's economic slowdown filters down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA and GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After four years of overflowing coffers, Los Angeles County is being
forced to cut services to cope with the state's economic slowdown,
which is hitting even as the federal government phases out a health
waiver that has allowed the county to spend hundreds of millions of
dollars annually beyond what the rules normally allow.</LD>
<LD>   Within moments of its release, the proposed fiscal year 2002-03
budget was being assailed by the Sheriff's Department, which
complained that the plan left it $50 million short of what it needs
to fulfill law enforcement obligations.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff Lee Baca and the county Board of Supervisors have battled
for months about his spending priorities, and sheriff's officials
said Monday that the new budget would force cutbacks.</LD>
<TE>   "As proposed, this budget is a recipe for disaster that
significantly impacts law enforcement," Baca's budget chief, Marvin
J. Dixon, told reporters after the county's budget presentation.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff would have to reduce services in unincorporated areas,
shrink or eliminate jails, and end investigative programs involving
hate crimes and identity theft, among others, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Gloria Molina said that according to the budget
proposal drafted by the county administrative office, the department
actually would receive $12.9 million more from the county next year.
The shortfall would result from costs that are increasing even
faster. Some of those, such as legal liability and increasing
workers' compensation expenses, are at least partly within Baca's
control, she said. Rising costs also include increased deputies'
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got the largest number of people on workmen's comp than any
other area. And look at the settlements that we're paying out,"
Molina said. "We're barely holding the line in almost all of the
departments. I think everybody is not happy with the budget as
proposed."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the $205-million decrease in the county's $16.2-billion
budget would come from service reductions in a number of areas.</TE>
<TE>   Among the proposals: closing a juvenile camp, increasing caseloads
for officers supervising juvenile probationers, ending the work
furlough program for jail inmates and the district attorney's
environmental crimes and sex crimes units, and cutting library hours
or closing branches.</TE>
<TE>   Those effects could be felt by many county residents, but some of
the most affected would be the poor and mentally ill. Cutbacks could
force a rough triage in treatment: Psychotics, for example, would be
served; those suffering from depression might not under a plan under
discussion at the department.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to be facing some pretty difficult choices," County
Administrator David Janssen told the supervisors' staff Monday
morning. To stave off layoffs, the county will eliminate about 500
jobs through attrition and delete nearly 2,000 vacant slots from the
books, he said.</TE>
<TE>   All that assumes the budget outlook holds, however. Some officials
fear that it may worsen between now and July, when the budget takes
effect. The state, Janssen said, could further reduce county funds as
it struggles with its own projected $17.5-billion shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed reductions are in addition to the county health
department's looming $688-million funding shortfall--a result of the
phasing out of a waiver to Medi-Cal rules allowing the county to bill
a higher rate for outpatient services. The waiver ends in three
years.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Probation Department, which received a boost last year
from new state crime-prevention grants, is losing ground. To cover
next year's $10-million shortfall, caseloads for officers supervising
juvenile probationers will rise from 81 to more than 100.</TE>
<TE>   San Dimas' Camp Glenn Rockey, where 120 juvenile delinquents who
committed low-level crimes participate in art programs and community
college classes, would be closed.</TE>
<TE>   Those young offenders would be sent to overcrowded juvenile halls
with more serious offenders, said Chief Probation Officer Richard
Shumsky.</TE>
<TE>   "In years like this, you just have to do the best you can,"
Shumsky said.</TE>
<TE>   But Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said Shumsky and others are playing
politics to try to squeeze more money out of the county.</TE>
<TE>   "We tell them you have to cut and they say, 'OK, we're going to
cut your favorite program,'" Yaroslavsky said. "I can assure you that
the camp is not the only thing the department can put up on the
chopping block."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the issues for the county are severe because of
insufficient tax receipts, reduced state funding, limited spending
flexibility and steadily growing costs.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon, from the Sheriff's Department, complained Monday that the
agency does not have that much fat to cut. It closed a
medium-security jail and emptied the wing of another jail this year
to cut down on staff and reduce what was shaping up as a $40-million
shortfall this year.</TE>
<TE>   That still has left a $25-million overrun on his $1.4-billion
budget this year, leading supervisors to require Baca to submit
monthly expenditure reports.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors in turn complain about pet projects and some
eyebrow-raising purchases, including an airplane.</TE>
<TE>   Also adding to the pain is a $27-million civil rights lawsuit that
Baca settled last year with jail inmates who claimed that they were
detained too long and illegally strip-searched. It will be paid over
three years.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Supervisor Mike Antonovich lamented the proposal's
implications for Baca and his department.</TE>
<TE>   "This budget represents the fleecing of the county's law
enforcement departments," Tony Bell said. But he acknowledged that
changing the proposal will take more than one vote and "it remains to
be seen" whether he has enough support on the board.</TE>

<HD>Striking Bus Drivers Reject Offer</HD>
<DH>Labor: Only two of 415 voting members back new Laidlaw
contract. Benefits are the stumbling block.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Striking school bus drivers on Monday rejected a settlement proposal
that significantly increased their hourly wage but did little to
improve their benefits, union officials said.</LD>
<LD>   That means the 2-week-old walkout, affecting 20,000 Los Angeles
Unified School District students, will continue.</LD>
<LD>   According to Teamsters Union Local 572 head Rick Middleton, only
two of the 415 voting members accepted the offer made late last week
by Laidlaw Education Services, the district's largest transportation
contractor.</LD>
<TE>   Union leaders had recommended against the offer and returned to
talks with Laidlaw on Friday night in hopes of improving it. Those
talks failed Saturday morning, and no future negotiations have been
scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   "The members are as concerned as we are," said Middleton. "But
they're holding tough. They've told me they'll strike as long it
takes, plus one day."</TE>
<TE>   Middleton said union leaders hope to end the deadlock on benefits
by shopping for a less expensive health plan than the one currently
offered to Laidlaw bus drivers. If such a plan is found, Middleton
said, the savings would purchase wider coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Laidlaw Vice President Jim Ferraro said he asked the union to stop
the strike while both sides looked for a better health plan, but the
Teamsters refused.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we're just waiting," Ferraro said. "We're definitely shut
down."</TE>
<TE>   Ferraro would not say how much the strike is costing Laidlaw, but
the L.A. Unified contract is among the company's largest, and Ferraro
did say that executives have begun to discuss cost-cutting measures,
including layoffs, to offset losses.</TE>
<TE>   Since the strike began, the district has put its in-house
transportation supervisors and dispatchers behind the wheels of
district-owned buses on routes usually served by Laidlaw. Students,
however, still are experiencing delays of nearly an hour each way. At
least two schools have shortened their schedules during the strike.</TE>
<TE>   Until this week, field trips and athletic events had been
curtailed. Now, district transportation officials have worked out
several deals with smaller firms to provide 70 new replacement buses
to ferry students to varsity athletic events.</TE>
<TE>   The striking bus drivers have no local fund to help them during
the walkout. This week, the national Teamsters office began to pay
each striker $55 a week.</TE>
<TE>   The Teamsters have been striking for wages comparable to
district-employed school bus drivers. Laidlaw's last offer would have
increased their drivers' hourly wage by an average of 6.3% annually
for three years. They now earn $8 to $15 an hour.</TE>

<HD>Condor Egg Hatches in Wild as Scientists Watch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time in 18 years, a pair of California condors have
laid, brooded and hatched an egg in the wild, thrilling biologists
and wildlife officials who hope similar births will someday lift
North America's largest bird off the endangered species list.</LD>
<LD>   Chubby, bald-headed and covered in fluffy white down, the
tennis-ball-sized chick hatched last week in a high sandstone cave
deep in the Los Padres National Forest north of Fillmore in Ventura
County.</LD>
<LD>   Biologists, who have monitored the egg for almost two months, say
the condor parents are being gentle and feeding the chick every day.
That's significant because condor pairs have been known to tear their
chicks apart in parental spats over who gets to feed the baby.</LD>
<TE>   "We are ecstatic," said Bruce Palmer, California Condor Recovery
program coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "We are
jumping up and down over this whole event. In so many ways it has
validated the work we have done over the years. So far, the pair
seems to be doing the right things."</TE>
<TE>   But there is fear that inexperienced parents or predators such as
golden eagles and ravens will kill the young bird.</TE>
<TE>   Chicks are especially vulnerable in the first few weeks, and it
will take six months before the baby will be fully feathered and
ready to fly.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, wildlife officials are tempering their
excitement with caution.</TE>
<TE>   "I will keep my fingers crossed until it takes its first flight,"
said Michael Barth, a biologist at the Hopper Mountain National
Wildlife Refuge near Fillmore, which supervises condor recovery
efforts in Southern California. "[But] a lot of people doubted
whether the birds could get to this point, and here they are."</TE>
<TE>   Allan Mee, a biologist with the San Diego Zoo, witnessed the
hatching.</TE>
<TE>   Last Wednesday, while observing the egg with binoculars from an
observation post, he saw a sizable hole appear on one side. A crack
appeared shortly after. The male was sitting on the egg at the time.
Then the female returned and began turning the egg over and over.</TE>
<TE>   "The female stood on the shell gently and the chick rolled out,"
Mee said. "She homed in on the chick and they started to brood it. It
was like a new toy for them. The male was very keen to play with the
chick.</TE>
<TE>   "They were both very gentle; there was no aggression there. I was
pretty amazed and relieved that it hatched."</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, scientists began gathering condor eggs from the wild. The
last egg hatched in the wild was in 1984, and the $35-million condor
captive breeding program began the following year.</TE>
<TE>   Facing extinction, condors were taken in from the wild, bred in
captivity and, starting in 1992, released again, along with their
young. Since then, scientists have been waiting for the younger birds
to become sexually mature and begin laying eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Hopes were raised last year when a condor egg was found in rural
Santa Barbara County. Hoping to protect the egg, scientists removed
it and substituted a fake ceramic egg in its place. The real egg was
put back when it was near hatching. But three days after it emerged,
the chick was killed by a female condor for reasons that remain
unclear.</TE>
<TE>   The condor population is slowly recovering, however. There are 63
condors living in the wild in California and Arizona, 18 in field
pens awaiting release and 104 in captivity.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the wild birds, which have 9-foot wingspans and weigh
about 20 pounds, live in sanctuaries in Big Sur, Los Padres National
Forest and the Grand Canyon. The recovery program wants to develop a
population of condors in California and Arizona with 150 birds each,
including 15 breeding pairs, Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   "My job is to get them off the endangered species list," he said.
"And our first goal is to get them down-listed from endangered to
threatened."</TE>
<TE>   Mee has been studying the egg since mid-February. Over the next
two weeks, he said, the chick could die of exposure unless warmed
constantly by the parents.</TE>
<TE>   "It is still very dependent on its parents," he said. "But they
seem to know what to do when it comes to feeding and brooding."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier efforts by Fish and Wildlife Service scientists to remove
the egg and replace it with a phony one failed when the male
aggressively defended his nest. His strong parental instincts buoyed
the confidence of the biologists.</TE>
<TE>   California Condor Recovery Team leader Mike Wallace shot video of
the chick and its parents.</TE>
<TE>   "What I saw was very encouraging," he said. "They nibble the chick
around the face and preen it. They are gentle and cautious.</TE>
<TE>   "But I got a report on Saturday that the calmness was frayed and
they were getting agitated with each other."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace said the entire effort is fraught with unknowns. "We are
guardedly optimistic," he said. "It's a new situation for them and
they don't know how to relate yet."</TE>

<HD>Differing Views of L.A. Crime</HD>
<DH>Chief: Clashing figures cited in reappointment battle
cover different time frames.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUG SMITH and JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks says crime is down on his
watch. Rick J. Caruso, president of the Police Commission, which
voted last week not to reappoint Parks to a second term, says crime
is rising.</LD>
<LD>   Who's right?</LD>
<LD>   Actually, both men are correct, but each is using numbers
selectively to best make his point.</LD>
<TE>   Caruso cites the city's crime rate for the most recent two-year
period covered by FBI statistics. During that time--1999 through
2000--the city's murder rate increased by 26%.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, who is due to appear before the City Council today to
appeal the commission's decision, takes a more long-term approach.
The murder rate in 2000 was 9% lower than when he became chief in
1997.</TE>
<TE>   Even assuming that the crime rate is a good way to measure a
police chief's effectiveness--which some criminologists dismiss--the
verdict of whether the city is safer than when Parks took charge is
much less clear than either claims.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, whose bid for a second term has been opposed by Mayor James
K. Hahn, came into office midway through the largest crime decline in
decades. The violent crime rate bottomed out at about the midpoint of
his five-year term and is now heading back up.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the city's murder and robbery rates are still lower than
when Parks became chief, but not by much.</TE>
<TE>   Parks invited the scrutiny of crime rates as a measure of his
success or failure almost immediately after being appointed by former
Mayor Richard J. Riordan in August 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Vowing to make Los Angeles "the safest big city" in the nation, he
told reporters that "if [crime] decreases, it is a positive for ...
L.A. If it increases, the chief of police hasn't done his job."</TE>
<TE>   In announcing the commission's 4-1 vote against Parks last week,
Caruso cited comparative crime statistics among the reasons the chief
did not deserve reappointment. "Violent crime has continued to rise,
while according to FBI statistics, cities such as New York and
Chicago are experiencing a drop in violent crime," Caruso said.
"[Since] 1999, violent crime is up and continues to rise, a trend
this commission cannot nor should ignore."</TE>
<TE>   Caruso is correct that the murder rate has risen slightly in Los
Angeles in each of the three years since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   And FBI statistics show that the rate has fallen in New York and
Chicago in recent years, although in New York it went up slightly in
1999 and then down again in 2000 and the first six months of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But looking at America's five largest urban centers over the last
six years for which the FBI has full statistics, the trend in Los
Angeles is similar to the other major cities.</TE>
<TE>   New York experienced the most persistent drop in violent crime
from 1995 through 2000. Murders dropped almost in half--from 16 per
100,000 people to 9--and robberies from 810 to 420.</TE>
<TE>   In Chicago, murders fell from 30 to 22 per 100,000 over the same
period, and robberies from 1,094 to 679. Violent crime was also
trending down in Houston and Philadelphia, though more modestly.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, murders declined from 25 per 100,000 people to 15
and robberies from 841 to 418.</TE>
<TE>   There were strong signs in all five cities that the downward trend
for violent crime was leveling off in 1999 and 2000. But, while the
crime rates for murder and robbery continued to edge slightly
downward in New York, Chicago and Houston, they moved upward in
L.A--from 12 murders per 100,000 in 1999 to 15 in 2000 and from 395
robberies to 418. For 2001, the murder rate in Los Angeles was up
again slightly after a decline during the first six months, according
to LAPD statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Yet at the same time, L.A. had the lowest robbery rate of the five
big cities and a lower murder rate than Chicago or Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   All five cities looked positively safe compared with Detroit, the
nation's 11th-largest city, which had a murder rate of more than 40
per 100,000 in all six years.</TE>
<TE>   None of these statistics is necessarily relevant to how well a
chief does his job, some criminologists say. To them, the puzzle is
why crime rose so dramatically in cities across the nation during the
1980s and early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, for example, the number of murders in 1990 was
983; but 10 years later, there were 550 murders.</TE>
<TE>   Some suggest that the violent crime spike was an exceptional peak
that is unlikely to repeat itself. Possible explanations include the
crack cocaine epidemic and a jump in gun use by juveniles.</TE>
<TE>   Many experts agree with Parks' view that at least one factor
driving the city's crime numbers up recently is that the rate
declined so much by the late 1990s that the only direction left to go
was up.</TE>
<TE>   "It can't go down forever," said John E. Eck, associate professor
of criminal justice at the University of Cincinnati, who has studied
the impact of policing on crime. "It has to bounce back up."</TE>
<TE>   Eck urged caution about drawing any conclusions on recent trends.
Despite the debate in Los Angeles over who is to blame for crime,
"one can easily see what's happening in Los Angeles now as just the
natural course of events," he said. Adults returning to the streets
from prison are probably another factor, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Eck said Parks and Caruso are on shaky ground when they try to
link crime trends to policing. Studies seeking to demonstrate that
link show mixed results, he said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, there is little evidence to show that increases in
the size of police forces during the 1990s had an impact on crime
rates, he said.</TE>
<TE>   One reason may be that crime--especially drug crime accompanied by
violence--tends to be highly concentrated geographically. Therefore,
increasing the number of police officers across an entire city
results in only a limited number of new officers present in any
single neighborhood.</TE>

<HD>Deacon Pleads No Contest to Abuse</HD>
<DH>Crime: Catholic layman, who worked at South El Monte
church, admits felony sex charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON and BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Catholic deacon who worked at a South El Monte church faces more
than four years in prison after pleading no contest to felony charges
of providing pornographic material to young boys and sexual battery
on one of them, officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The sentencing of Deacon Arturo Ahumada, a layman who served on
the staff at Epiphany Catholic Church, was postponed Monday until May
14. He pleaded no contest on March 4 to charges that he showed a
pornographic videotape to two boys he met through the parish and
molested one of them at his home.</LD>
<LD>   Ahumada's sex abuse case is the fourth involving the Los Angeles
Archdiocese in the last five years, according to Cardinal Roger M.
Mahony. He said seven other cases involving abusive priests occurred
before 1997. The names of all accused priests have been given to
authorities, Mahony said.</LD>
<TE>   Ahumada used his position with the church "to befriend these boys
and manipulate them," said Det. Albert Maldonado of the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department Family Crimes Unit.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Ahumada, 45, invited two boys, ages 15 and
16, to his South El Monte home several times for dinner between March
1 and March 31 last year. He showed them a pornographic videotape,
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Habib A. Balian. Ahumada also molested one of
the boys, Balian said.</TE>
<TE>   "He acted as a kind of father figure and close friend to these
boys," Maldonado said. "They'd go over to his home together and
separately."</TE>
<TE>   Maldonado said one of boys decided "he had enough" and told a
South El Monte high school guidance counselor. That counselor,
Maldonado said, reported the alleged sexual abuse to the Sheriff's
Department. Sheriff's detectives arrested Ahumada in July.</TE>
<TE>   The deacon entered an open plea, meaning that he made no plea
bargain with prosecutors. He will be sentenced by Pomona Court
Commissioner Wade Olson on two felony counts of providing illicit
materials to minors and one count of misdemeanor sexual battery on a
boy.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese officials said Ahumada will no longer serve the
ministry.</TE>
<TE>   "There is the legal process that the person is going through,"
said Tod Tamberg, an archdiocese spokesman. "But we also have a
higher standard ourselves because of our responsibility to protect
children, and so he will not return to ministry."</TE>
<TE>   There are three other investigations involving the L.A.
Archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Father David Granadino is under investigation by the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department for allegedly abusing boys at St. Francis
of Rome Catholic Church in Azusa. Sheriff's officials said the
investigation should be completed by week's end. Nearly 100 altar
servers, students and others have been interviewed by authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony has removed Granadino from his post, pending the outcome of
the criminal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In another case, Mahony said a priest was reported to the Bell
Gardens Police Department in 1997 or 1998 based on allegations by a
parent that her son had been abused. The mother and her son have
since left the state and have not been located, Mahony said.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal forced the accused priest to leave the ministry in
1998. Mahony said that, as far as he knows, the priest has also left
Southern California. He would not name the man.</TE>
<TE>   A third priest was removed from the ministry by Mahony in 1997
because of sexual misconduct. The priest came to the attention of
authorities when a therapist reported that he had allegedly pinched a
girl on the buttocks. Mahony said that no criminal charge was filed,
but that additional information led him to fire the priest for his
affairs with women.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony sent a letter recently to Los Angeles County Dist. Atty.
Steve Cooley and to Los Angeles Police Department detectives
revealing the Bell Gardens case, as well as the pinching allegation.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said he wants to turn over all abuse information to Los
Angeles authorities. "We've given them carte blanche," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said he will err on the side of caution in ridding the
church of alleged abusers.</TE>
<TE>   "We have evolved toward what I would call a very, very strict
zero-tolerance today," Mahony said in an interview last week. "We've
learned a lot, unfortunately."</TE>

<HD>State Sues 2 Power Firms</HD>
<DH>Courts: Federal antitrust violations, price gouging
alleged. Attorney general urges the sale of some Reliant, Mirant
plants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer sued two electricity companies
Monday, alleging that they exert illegal control of California's
electricity market and should be forced to sell power plants.</LD>
<LD>   Lockyer sued Reliant Energy of Houston and Mirant Corp. of Atlanta
in federal court in San Francisco. He accuses the companies of
violating federal antitrust laws, stifling competition and illegally
driving up prices.</LD>
<LD>   The suits "are aimed at restoring real competition by requiring
these energy companies to sell off some of their power plants," said
Lockyer.</LD>
<TE>   His lawsuits are the latest of several legal attacks on energy
companies that profited during California's 2000-01 electricity
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer has also accused Reliant, Mirant and other power plant
owners and marketers of violating state business practice laws.</TE>
<TE>   Company Calls Suits 'Election-Year Ploy'</TE>
<TE>   Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley called the lawsuits baseless
and "an election-year ploy that will discourage the development of
new supplies of electricity."</TE>
<TE>   Reliant and Mirant bought power plants in California at the
invitation of state regulators trying to break up the electricity
service monopolies of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric. The utilities were forced to auction plants under
California's ill-fated and largely defunct deregulation scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Mirant's corporate predecessor, Southern Energy, bought three Bay
Area power plants from PG&amp;E for $801 million in 1999. Reliant bought
five plants--in Daggett, Etiwanda, Goleta, South Oxnard and West
Oxnard--from Edison for $277 million in 1998. According to Lockyer,
Mirant controls roughly 44% of the Northern California power market,
while Reliant controls 28% of the market in the south.</TE>
<TE>   "We're damned if we do, damned if we don't," said Mirant spokesman
Patrick Dorinson.</TE>
<TE>   "The state wanted energy companies to invest in the state. We
invested ... and our thanks for that is multiple lawsuits and
accusations."</TE>

<HD>Port Hueneme Woman Found Slashed to Death in Bed; Husband
Arrested</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 41-year-old Port Hueneme man was in custody Monday on suspicion of
killing his wife, after she was found slashed in the couple's bed
over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Alberto Mora Solis was set to be arraigned today. He was booked at
Ventura County Jail on suspicion of murder after relatives called
police to the couple's Bard Road home near Parkview Elementary School
about 4:30 p.m. Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Inside, police found the bloody body of 51-year-old Olga Solis.</LD>
<TE>   Alberto Solis was at home when police arrived, said Port Hueneme
Det. Ken Dobbe. The detective said the husband made "incriminating
statements" when questioned by relatives and police, but Dobbe would
not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives told police the Solises had a history of marital
problems, Dobbe said.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County coroner's officials said Olga Solis died from a cut
to the neck. Dobbe said she appeared to have been cut with a knife
and another instrument.</TE>
<TE>   Police said a relative who lives in a structure behind the Solises
grew suspicious Sunday afternoon when he saw the husband with cuts on
his neck and wrists. That relative contacted other family members,
who went to police.</TE>
<TE>   The couple had no children, Dobbe said. Police said neither
husband nor wife appeared to have a criminal record, and they found
no history of domestic-violence calls to the house.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Alberto Solis is a construction worker out on
disability from a back injury.</TE>
<TE>   Olga Solis was a nine-year employee of Moorpark-based Kavlico
Corp., working on an assembly line making automotive sensors.</TE>
<TE>   Luz Tamayo and Loni Howell, co-workers of Olga Solis who sometimes
car-pooled with her, described her as a kind, quiet woman who rarely
spoke of her home life but was often in a hurry to get home in time
to have dinner on the table for her husband.</TE>
<TE>   She had been working extra hours since her husband's injury, they
said. "Poor Olga," Howell said. "She's been on overtime since before
Christmas trying to make ends meet."</TE>

<HD>IRS Arrests Tax Foe in $6-Million Fraud Case</HD>
<DH>Crime: Lynne Meredith of Sunset Beach and six associates
allegedly sold bogus trusts as shelters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lynne Meredith, an antitax activist who speaks frequently at seminars
across the country, once boasted that she has never paid income taxes
and hasn't received so much as a letter or phone call from the
Internal Revenue Service.</LD>
<LD>   All that changed Monday, however, when federal authorities chose
the tax-filing deadline to arrest Meredith and six colleagues on
charges that they bilked victims out of more than $6 million in a
worldwide tax fraud scam.</LD>
<LD>   Meredith, a 52-year-old Sunset Beach resident, was also charged
with failure to file income tax forms and of persuading followers to
file fraudulent returns and make bogus complaints to the IRS.</LD>
<TE>   A 35-count grand jury indictment said Meredith and the others sold
bogus "pure trusts"--which Meredith said would prevent holders from
ever having to pay income taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The trusts were sold through Meredith's We the People
organization, which is also known as Free the People, Sovereignty
Pure Trusts and Liberty International. Authorities alleged that
Meredith and others charged as much as $500 apiece and established
the trusts using false IDs and bogus Social Security numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "Meredith misled numerous people into believing that the tax
shelters she was selling would legally keep them from having to pay
income taxes," said Michael S. Kochmanski, special agent in charge
with the IRS criminal investigations office in Los Angeles. "Instead,
many of these people now find themselves owing back taxes, penalties
and interest."</TE>
<TE>   Meredith could not be reached for comment Monday, and an employee
at her office declined to comment. Some of her followers, however,
immediately criticized the U.S. attorney's office for filing charges
and said Meredith has done nothing illegal.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a decade, Meredith has traveled the nation giving
seminars on how to avoid paying income taxes. The others charged with
one count of conspiracy and 11 counts of mail fraud were trust
salespersons employed by Meredith. They were Gayle Bisbee, 54, of
Sunset Beach; Gregory Paul Karl, 52, of Solana Beach; Teresa Manharth
Giordano, 39, of Murrieta; Willie Watts, 43, of Murrieta; Betty
Erickson, 57, of Windsor; and Nadia Moore, 53, of Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Alicia Villarreal said Meredith's arrest on
April 15 was an unintended irony. Villarreal said authorities had
planned to arrest her Friday but postponed that action so Meredith
could attend funeral services for her mother over the weekend.</TE>

<HD>Man Surrenders in Fund Fraud</HD>
<DH>Crime: An L.A. Times temporary worker is set to be
arraigned today in connection with the theft of $64, 236 from the
paper's 9/11 relief effort.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Los Angeles Times employee surrendered to Los Angeles police
Monday in connection with the theft of $64,236 from the newspaper's
Sept. 11 Disaster Relief Fund.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Childress, 35, a temporary employee hired to process mail
and donations to the fund, is scheduled for arraignment today on two
counts of theft and three counts of grand theft.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors said the thefts were uncovered after several donors
complained about grammatical and spelling errors in the thank-you
notes they received from The Times.</LD>
<TE>   "If this guy had used spell check, he might have gotten away with
it," said Jane Robison, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Times Publisher and President John P. Puerner announced last month
that The Times would make corporate contributions to cover money lost
in the thefts. The relief effort by the McCormick Tribune Foundation
collected a total of $2.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Robison alleged that Childress copied credit card information from
dozens of donors and then charged the cardholders for deposits he
made between September and March to a bank account he had set up. The
account used the same initials as the relief fund.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Det. Edgar White said Childress was identified because he
used his own name to open the bank account and provided the bank with
correct personal information, including his birth date and Social
Security number.</TE>
<TE>   White said that after he identified Childress as the suspect,
White paged him.</TE>
<TE>   "He called me back," White said. "We talked.... He surrendered
Monday morning at Parker Center."</TE>
<TE>   Childress, who faces up to four years in prison, is being held in
lieu of $124,000 bail pending today's court appearance.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Police Department on Monday called for the public's
help in solving the slaying of an 18-year-old honor student and
varsity basketball player at Verdugo Hills High School who was found
dead in a closet.</LD>
<LD>   Linda Au was found Sunday morning in her mother's home in the 3200
block of Baldwin Street in Lincoln Heights. Police said she had been
beaten and possibly strangled, but an autopsy would be necessary to
determine the cause of death.</LD>
<LD>   Police ask anyone with information to call a toll-free number,
(877) 529-3855. Investigating officers are Dets. Joe Preciado and Tom
Herman of the Hollenbeck station.</LD>
<TE>   Monica Carazo, a Los Angeles Unified School District spokeswoman,
said that Au was well-liked at her high school and had never been in
trouble. Extra counselors were sent to the school to comfort
students.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors heard screams from the house about 12:30 a.m. Sunday.
Before police arrived, however, Au's mother found her body underneath
a pile of clothes in a bedroom closet.</TE>
<TE>   No suspects have been identified, said police spokesman Don Cox.</TE>

<HD>Davis Discloses Taxes, Takes Slap at Simon</HD>
<DH>Politics: Documents show governor and his wife paid
$54,000. He attacks challenger for not revealing returns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis released his tax returns Monday, showing that he and
his wife paid more than $54,000 in taxes last year, and he criticized
his Republican challenger, Bill Simon Jr., for refusing to release
his tax returns.</LD>
<LD>   Simon spokesman James Fisfis would not comment on whether Simon
paid state or federal income taxes in 2001. He said the Republican
candidate, who is a multimillionaire, "has no plans to release his
returns at this time."</LD>
<LD>   Later in the day, Simon campaign manager Sal Russo said Simon's
returns are complicated and that he has filed for an extension. Over
the years, Russo said, the candidate has paid substantial income
taxes.</LD>
<TE>   Saying that Simon absolutely should release his tax returns, Davis
added: "Part of running for governor is making available your tax
return so people can see you're paying your fair share."</TE>
<TE>   No law requires candidates to release their tax returns. However,
the practice is becoming increasingly common, especially for career
politicians like Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Using Monday's tax filing deadline as an opportunity to contrast
his modest holdings with those of his wealthy challenger, Davis
released a return showing that he had income of $200,351, including
$37,500 that Sharon Davis earned as a consultant.</TE>
<TE>   She is on the board of directors of Golden State Food, a company
owned by billionaire and Davis patron Ron Burkle.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and his wife reported paying $44,177 in federal income
taxes, and $12,442 in state taxes. They overpaid their state taxes by
$367, and were entitled to a refund of $948 from Uncle Sam.</TE>
<TE>   The governor reported donating $2,475 worth of clothing and home
furnishings to benefit various charitable thrift shops, and $4,290 in
cash donations. Their biggest deduction, $11,558, was interest paid
on their condominium in West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Fisfis said Simon has complied with state law by publicly filing
with the Fair Political Practices Commission a statement of economic
interests outlining his holdings.</TE>

<HD>Mayor, Others Discuss LAPD After Parks</HD>
<DH>Police: Hahn wants someone less 'politically influential'
than in the past. Chief makes his case to City Council today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD and TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even as Police Chief Bernard C. Parks mounts a last-ditch effort to
hold onto his job--with an appearance today before the Los Angeles
City Council--Mayor James K. Hahn and some members of the council are
looking past that appearance and sketching out what kind of
replacement they hope to hire.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn, who has called Parks stubborn and inflexible, says he thinks
the next chief should hold less political sway than the men who
historically have run the Los Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   "We have got to the point in Los Angeles where we've basically
created this colossal figure of the chief of police who towers over
appointed civilian oversight, who towers over political figures,"
Hahn said in a radio interview last week.</LD>
<TE>   The next chief, Hahn added in another interview, will be one "who
understands that civilians run the Police Department."</TE>
<TE>   If Parks fails in his bid with the City Council, Hahn would select
the next chief from recommendations made to him by the Police
Commission. The mayor's nominee would be subject to confirmation by
the council.</TE>
<TE>   Council members were making arrangements Monday for what many
expect to be a contentious session. The City Council is expected to
allow Parks to make a presentation at 10 a.m. on his accomplishments
as police chief during the last 4 1/2 years. The lawmakers will then
decide Wednesday whether to overturn the Police Commission's decision
to deny Parks a second five-year term.</TE>
<TE>   Under the city charter, the City Council has until Friday to
overturn the Police Commission. But so far, only three of the 15
council members have expressed interest in getting involved in the
debate. That number has held constant since last week's Police
Commission vote not to reappoint Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Show of Support</TE>
<TE>   for Chief Expected</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, city officials expect hundreds of people to show up
at City Hall to voice their support for Parks. Members of the public
will not be allowed to address the lawmakers until after Parks
finishes his presentation, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' supporters--City Council members Nate Holden, Mark
Ridley-Thomas and Jan Perry--say they are hopeful that their
colleagues will be open-minded.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they will be fair," Holden said. "We are just trying to
follow through with the administrative procedure so no one can say
later on that he was denied his due process."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Parks retained two attorneys to defend his record
against the criticisms of some police commissioners that he had not
been honest with them during his evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the chief's interest in coming to the council is rooted
in his deep sense that he has been treated very, very poorly,"
Ridley-Thomas said. "His desire to make a statement before the
council is an expression of his hope that there is enough goodwill to
give him a fair shake."</TE>
<TE>   But if the council declines to overturn the commission, the matter
returns to the police panel, which can begin laying out the timetable
of a search process for Parks' replacement as early as next week. The
commission has the duty of narrowing a list of candidates to three
and forwarding those names to the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, who had no formal role in the reappointment evaluation of
Parks, said he plans to be an active participant in that process.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make sure when they give me that list of three
candidates that we've done the best job in searching to find the best
possible person, so I will be actively involved to make sure that the
outreach is there, that we're leaving no stone unturned," he said in
an interview.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said he does not have a short list at this point, and
has encouraged the commission to look for candidates both inside the
department and around the country. Police Commission President Rick
J. Caruso has said he hopes a strong candidate can be found from
within the ranks of the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Other city leaders Monday urged a broad canvass for potential
candidates. "It is critical to have someone who is committed to
reforming the Police Department, which still has a long way to go,"
City Councilman Eric Garcetti said. "We also need someone who is
representative of the city. I hope we will have qualified applicants
that include African Americans, Latinos, women, gays and lesbians."</TE>
<TE>   All the chiefs of the LAPD have been men, and all but the last two
have been white.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Hahn insists political pressure will not guide his
decision.</TE>
<TE>   "There'll be a clamor, I'm sure, from a lot of different groups
who are saying, 'It's our turn,'" he said. "But this decision
shouldn't be one based on political correctness or expediency. We
ought to try to find the best person."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he wants the next chief to be "inspirational," someone
who is a good listener and a leader who can both delegate well and
hold his subordinates accountable.</TE>
<TE>   "The police chief of Los Angeles is a national figure, right off
the bat," Hahn said. "So you're going to be a very important
individual when you assume that post. But I think what's happened in
the past is that, I think, police chiefs have been far more
politically influential I think than their job required."</TE>

<HD>Hahn Seeks Anti-Blight Funding</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn on Monday unveiled another piece of
his proposed city budget for next year, saying he wants to maintain
full funding for two existing initiatives designed to reduce blight
in neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn said he has set aside $3.6 million to pay for the
neighborhood prosecutors program and an expansion of the citywide
nuisance abatement program. The abatement program was started in the
city attorney's office while Hahn was city attorney.</LD>
<LD>   Rocky Delgadillo, the current city attorney, began the
neighborhood prosecutors program this year. Under it, prosecutors are
assigned to each LAPD division to target recurring problems such as
vandalism, drug use and other criminal behavior.</LD>
<TE>   "Neighborhood prosecutors are going to provide those additional
eyes and ears, and more important, the follow-through that is often
missing in government," the mayor said during a news conference
Monday in Watts.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's complete 2002-03 proposed city budget will be released
Friday. The City Council can review and modify the document.</TE>

<HD>Jewish Center Breaks Away in Bid to Survive</HD>
<DH>Community: After parent group decides to close Granada
Hills facility, its board votes to become independent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rather than close its doors, a Granada Hills Jewish community center
has decided to break away from its parent organization and
reestablish itself independently.</LD>
<LD>   The financially ailing Jewish Community Centers of Greater Los
Angeles, which oversees seven facilities citywide, plans to close the
North Valley Jewish Community Center on June 30 and sell its
property.</LD>
<LD>   Determined to keep a center operating, however, a 12-member North
Valley JCC committee was formed to discuss building a new center or
buying the existing property and running it as an independent
corporation.</LD>
<TE>   On Sunday, the community center's advisory board voted unanimously
to form a nonprofit organization, the North Valley Jewish Community
Center Inc.</TE>
<TE>   ''What we're hoping to be able to do is maintain a presence in the
north Valley,'' said Elaine Fox, acting president of the board.</TE>
<TE>   In late November, the Jewish Community Centers of Greater Los
Angeles said it owed between $1 million and $2 million to its main
funding source, the Jewish Federation of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   To deal with the financial crisis, the organization announced it
would close five centers, said David Novak, the agency's spokesman.
Since then, a sixth center, in the West Valley, was directed to make
cuts in staff and programs.</TE>
<TE>   Through grass-roots fund-raising efforts, two centers, one in the
Van Nuys/Sherman Oaks area, the other in West Los Angeles, are on
track to continue some programs next year.</TE>
<TE>   The JCC of Greater L.A. has discussed continuing operations at the
Silver Lake and West Valley centers, according to an April 5 letter
it sent to the Jewish Federation.</TE>
<TE>   That left the Bay Cities center in Santa Monica and the North
Valley center in Granada Hills to find means to purchase their
properties, Novak said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite efforts to partner with local temples or other Jewish
groups, the Bay Cities center will close in June, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Goodstein, a member of the North Valley center's advisory
board, said she doesn't hold any ill will toward the JCC of Greater
L.A. for selling off the properties.</TE>
<TE>   ''I think that if the JCC of Los Angeles could help everybody,
they would. They are just doing what makes good business sense for
them--and this was their decision,'' Goodstein said.</TE>
<TE>   ''We respect it, [but] we're just thinking of all the people in
the north Valley that want or need a place to be.''</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson is working to find backers
to contribute toward the purchase of the North Valley center at 16601
Rinaldi St., Goodstein said. So far, she said, fund-raising pledges
total $63,000.</TE>
<TE>   The amount needed will be determined by a real estate appraisal,
which is underway, Goodstein said</TE>
<TE>   The center's advisory board also instituted a new $100 annual
membership fee--down from the previous yearly fee of $250.</TE>
<TE>   All new and existing programs will be offered on a fee basis, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the first time the center has been forced to fight for
its survival, Goodstein said. Board members kept the center open in
1999 after alleged racist Buford Furrow shot three children and two
adults at the center before killing postal worker Joseph Ileto, she
pointed out.</TE>
<TE>   ''We won't let anybody shut us down,'' Goodstein said. ''We will
survive. Whatever it takes, we will weather through any storm thrown
our way.''</TE>

<HD>L.A. Unified, Federal Agency Quarrel Over Mid-Wilshire Land</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District and the Social Security
Administration are fighting over a small piece of land in the
mid-Wilshire area, with each side arguing that it desperately needs
the property to serve the community's needs.</LD>
<LD>   L.A. Unified wants the land for a school, and is pushing the
federal agency to give up a lease for a new building that the
landlord is putting on the site at Wilshire Boulevard and Wilton
Place.</LD>
<LD>   School district officials said they have been planning for nearly
three years to buy the property and build a primary center for 500
students in kindergarten through second grade, but had been unaware
of the federal agency's plans for the site.</LD>
<TE>   The district conducted environmental reviews of the site and
finished architectural renderings for the school, which officials
said is sorely needed in one of the city's most densely populated
areas.</TE>
<TE>   Without the site, a new primary center will be delayed by up to
seven years and the district will lose $10 million in state funding,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The district might have to acquire residential or commercial
property through eminent domain, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "These federal officials just do not understand the priorities of
the local community," said school board President Caprice Young.</TE>
<TE>   But Social Security officials said they can't break the 15-year
lease that the General Services Administration signed on their behalf
in September. The federal officials defended the importance of their
own work, saying they must move from their current site a few blocks
away because their caseloads--and staff--are expanding.</TE>
<TE>   The Social Security Administration office sends 32,000 checks each
month to recipients of federal aid in the mid-Wilshire corridor, west
of downtown. Recipients include the elderly, disabled and survivors
entitled to death benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "LAUSD has tried to make us look like the big bad wolf here," said
Sheila Leiter, director of the agency's Los Angeles metropolitan
area.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody adores children, but when they grow up and they've been
kicked around by life, no one adores them."</TE>

<HD>Lights Turn Off Fans of Park</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Activists fear Little League plan would pave
the way for further development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSE CARDENAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The battles over development in and around Elysian Park--a hilly area
near downtown Los Angeles with breathtaking views of the city's
sprawling landscape--have spanned years.</LD>
<LD>   Its fierce guardians have fought back, among other things,
proposals for a professional football stadium, oil drilling and an
expansion of the Los Angeles Police Academy in the pristine, 575-acre
park.</LD>
<LD>   The latest battle is over a proposal from the Northeast Little
League--which serves about 300 children from Lincoln Heights to
Silver Lake--to install lights on two hilltop diamonds just north of
Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to have a little more time for the children to play so
they're not running the streets," said Pete Plasentillo, president of
the league. "We need to give kids this opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks is considering
the proposal, which calls for 10 light poles--two of them 90 feet
tall--to be installed by fall.</TE>
<TE>   The group fighting off development since 1965 has been the
Citizens Committee to Save Elysian Park, which consists of 1,200
dues-paying members.</TE>
<TE>   The organization's steering committee, in an uncharacteristic
action, actually voted 7 to 4 in favor of the lights.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very difficult decision," said Scott Fajack, the
committee's president. "A lot of people weighted it differently than
fighting a football stadium. This was a nonprofit group that does a
good job at the site."</TE>
<TE>   But the minority on the committee remained vocal in their
opposition at a community meeting on the issue held last week by
recreation officials. Among the arguments: The lights could open the
door for other development.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was ill advised for us to take a position when we have
this much dissent," said Sallie Neubauer, past president and current
vice president of the committee.</TE>
<TE>   The committee majority aims "to be more of a friend and less of a
fighter," she said. "Unfortunately, in this business, you really have
to be a fighter--otherwise you lose the park."</TE>
<TE>   The first battle over Northeast Little League came in 1997 when
the Citizens Committee opposed the league's using the field. But that
year the league moved to the Elysian Park field from an old site in
Lincoln Heights.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Northeast Little League is operated by dozens of parents
who volunteer for everything from coaching to running the concession
stand and trimming the outfield.</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of the league is so great that it has to turn away
boys and girls, said Plasentillo, adding that the league plans to
start a softball program for girls.</TE>
<TE>   That's why league leaders came up with the idea for lights that
could accommodate games until 10 p.m. up to 120 nights a year.</TE>
<TE>   For months, Little League representatives met with the Citizens
Committee to try to address the committee's concerns.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Little League officials modified their plans, such as
agreeing to install black rather than silver poles that glitter in
the sunshine and using special lights that would shine strictly on
the baseball field.</TE>
<TE>   Agreeing to such details raised the estimated cost of the lights
from $125,000 to $250,000--which the Little League is willing to pay
to satisfy the committee's concerns, Plasentillo said.</TE>
<TE>   But the compromises have not pleased all members of the
committee--such as Neubauer, who has been part of the organization
since 1979.</TE>
<TE>   The Citizens Committee was formed almost 40 years ago by
journalist Grace Simons, a tenacious defender of Elysian Park. She
created the group to oppose the city's plan to take 63 parkland acres
for the Los Angeles Convention Center that was eventually built on
Figueroa Street.</TE>
<TE>   "We figured that if we had not stopped that project, by now there
would be no park at all," Neubauer said.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, the Citizens Committee has helped kill such things
as a preliminary idea for a football stadium. In January, the group
lobbied to stop Los Angeles Police Department bike officers from
training on a fire road in the park.</TE>
<TE>   Now those who oppose the lights say the issue is not whether the
Little League program is worthwhile--which most agree it is. Among
the issues, they say, is the impact that the lights would have on the
undeveloped area of the park.</TE>
<TE>   A pristine park, and not light standards, is a better heritage to
leave children, said Peter Shire, an artist and lifelong Echo Park
resident whose mother was one of the founding members of the Citizens
Committee. "The natural land is also part of our children's
heritage."</TE>
<TE>   Others have used the renewed focus on the Little League to suggest
that the whole program should be moved outside the park and that
nighttime is too late for children to be playing anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good to play, but they have the daytime and the weekend to
play," said Ming Siu, a resident of the area. "Why should they go
into the night?"</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Little League officials still need to raise the money
for the lights, Plasentillo said.</TE>
<TE>   One possible source for a good portion of the money is the Little
League's neighbors--the Dodg- ers, which indicated they would be
interested in helping buy the lights if the city approves. The
Recreation and Parks Department will consider all viewpoints, said
Mark Mariscal--who supervises the Elysian Park area. "The lights are
not a done deal," he said.</TE>

<HD>Hearing Underway in Racer's Slaying</HD>
<DH>Courts: Witness says defendant vowed to kill Mickey
Thompson, who was gunned down in 1988, and allegedly boasted that he
was 'too smart' to be caught.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors outlined their case Monday against a businessman accused
of murdering racing legend Mickey Thompson and his wife in 1988,
bringing forward a witness who claims Michael Goodwin vowed to kill
Thompson two months before the slayings.</LD>
<LD>   Thompson, the first American to break the 400-mph land speed mark,
and his wife, Trudy, were fatally shot in the San Gabriel Valley
community of Bradbury by two masked men on bicycles who have never
been identified. Police allege that Goodwin of Dana Point ordered the
hit because of a business dispute with Thompson, his partner.</LD>
<LD>   An Orange County Superior Court judge should decide this week
whether Goodwin should stand trial for the killings. The case is
being prosecuted in Orange County because that's where the plot was
allegedly hatched.</LD>
<TE>   The preliminary hearing got underway Monday in Santa Ana with
testimony from a Goodwin friend. William Wilson, who is retired from
the Pasadena Police Department and general manager of Qualcomm
Stadium in San Diego, invited Goodwin and his then-wife, Diane, to
dinner in January 1988.</TE>
<TE>   According to Wilson, Goodwin said his business wasn't doing well
and that he would "have Thompson taken out." Wilson said he responded
that it was a bad idea and that Goodwin could end up in prison.
Goodwin allegedly responded: "They'll never catch me. I'm too smart
for that."</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, Goodwin allegedly told Wilson: "You know I
would never do that."</TE>
<TE>   Another prosecution witness, Kathryn Weise, said she also heard
Goodwin threaten to kill Thompson during a heated conversation
between the two men.</TE>
<TE>   Weise, who was working for Goodwin at the time, testified that the
defendant told Thompson: "You know, Mickey, I can take you out. I can
have you taken out and have you fixed."</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department detective testified that
Goodwin was identified by two Thompson neighbors who said Goodwin was
with a passenger inside an old station wagon parked in front of their
home about five days before the slayings. When the neighbors
approached the car, they said the driver sped away.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Jeffrey Benice said his client is innocent. He
said there is conflicting evidence about the number of suspects seen
fleeing the Thompson home and whether they were black or white.</TE>
<TE>   "We think there's very legitimate grounds to get this dismissed,"
Benice said.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony will continue today. Benice said he will bring in
Goodwin's ex-wife, Diane Siedel, to dispute the prosecution's
testimony. Siedel has recanted her earlier statement that Goodwin was
involved in the killings.</TE>

<HD>Ethics Panel to Weigh 'Soft Money' Reforms</HD>
<DH>Campaigns: Proposed changes are prompted by increase in
expenditures that circumvent the city's contribution and spending
limits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY L. RABIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Ethics Commission today will consider a sweeping
set of rules aimed at countering an increase in so-called soft money
that some believe is undermining the city's limits on campaign
contributions and spending.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed changes were prompted by concerns that last year's
campaigns in Los Angeles, particularly for mayor and city attorney,
were influenced by substantial spending outside the city's control.</LD>
<LD>   The Ethics Commission, established by Los Angeles voters a dozen
years ago to reduce the influence of special interests at City Hall,
finds itself buffeted by the same kind of forces affecting campaigns
at the state and national level. While the city sets limits on
campaign contributions and spending by candidates who agree to accept
public matching money, it has little control over so-called
independent expenditures, which have become popular tools of special
interest groups.</LD>
<TE>   This noncandidate spending soared to a record of $3.2 million in
city races last year.</TE>
<TE>   Powered by donations from billboard companies, Indian tribes,
labor unions and political parties, the expenditures circumvented the
city's contribution and spending limits. In particular, massive
amounts of money poured into efforts to elect James K. Hahn or
Antonio Villaraigosa as mayor and Rocky Delgadillo as city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Ethics Commission Executive Director LeeAnn Pelham said a 54-page
report to be presented to the commission this morning offers a
blueprint for "significant and meaningful improvements" in the city's
political reform laws.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed changes, which must be approved by the City Council,
would increase the amount of public matching funds a candidate can
receive under certain situations. Currently the city will match
contributions of up to $500 for citywide races and $250 for council
races dollar for dollar for candidates that abide by campaign
spending limits.</TE>
<TE>   That 1-to-1 match would be boosted to a 3-to-1 match for
candidates who abide by spending limits and face any of three
situations. It would apply to those who are:</TE>
<TE>   Running against a wealthy candidate waging a largely self-funded
campaign;</TE>
<TE>   Targeted by advertising bought by independent expenditures;</TE>
<TE>   In a race with a candidate who is supported by independent
expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a $500 contribution from an individual to a candidate
for mayor, city attorney or controller would grow to $2,000 after the
candidate receives $1,500 in public matching money. A City Council
candidate who raises $250 from an individual could get $750 in
matching money.</TE>
<TE>   The approach is designed to encourage fund-raising in smaller
amounts from individuals to offset the impact of big checks from
businesses, political action committees and more affluent donors.</TE>
<TE>   For this approach to work, the Ethics Commission would have to
establish a way to determine which candidate benefits from
independent spending on mailers, advertising and other campaign
activities. The commission also would have to set a threshold of
independent expenditures that would trigger the increased match of
public money.</TE>
<TE>   The commission also will decide whether to require officials who
receive large amounts of free space on billboards not to participate
in decisions affecting the company involved. That proposal is certain
to generate criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Hahn and City Atty. Delgadillo both received hundreds of
thousands of dollars in free billboard space last year. The city
attorney's office, which provides legal advice to the Ethics
Commission, has issued a written opinion saying there are
constitutional problems with requiring an official to recuse himself
or herself from voting on matters affecting a substantial donor.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the commission wants to tighten laws defining
cooperation between political campaigns and those making independent
expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   That question is being considered by the commission in the wake of
an investigation by the district attorney's office into circumstances
surrounding a $100,000 independent expenditure by the Soboba Band of
Mission Indians against former Assembly Speaker Villaraigosa. The
contribution was solicited by a political operative with connections
to the Hahn campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The reform package would also require those making independent
expenditures to report their spending within 24 hours and provide a
text or copy of their mailers or commercials. Such an approach could
put the city on a collision course with the state Fair Political
Practices Commission.</TE>

<LD>Attorneys for former Playboy playmate Anna Nicole Smith asked a
federal judge Monday to add as much as $30 million to a judgment she
won in a dispute over her late husband's estate.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Philip W. Boesch said the money was interest Smith would
have earned on the $88 million she was awarded last month from the
estate of oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall.</LD>
<LD>   But attorneys for Smith's stepson, who has bitterly opposed giving
any money to Smith, said they planned to appeal the initial judgment
and any subsequent rulings.</LD>

<LD>Residents who live within a mile of a Bolsa Chica site contaminated
by a cancer-causing agent will receive notices from the state
Department of Toxic Substances Control this month.</LD>
<LD>   Officials have known for three years about the polychlorinated
biphenyl, or PCB, contamination on 11/2 acres of unincorporated
county land owned by Signal Landmark near the end of Graham Street.</LD>
<LD>   The carcinogen is not carried in the air and is not expected to
leach into the ground water, said Lucy Dunn, executive vice president
of Hearthside Homes, which is trying to develop nearby land. Contact
with the soil could be harmful, but the site has been fenced for more
than a year. The source of the contamination is unknown, though it
could be from past oil operations, illegal dumping or electrical
transformers, officials said.</LD>

<LD>An Irvine title insurance company has admitted it broke state
campaign finance law when it reimbursed employees for the $2,250 they
contributed to two Orange County candidates in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Fidelity National Title Insurance Co. has agreed to pay a $16,000
fine in a settlement with the state Fair Political Practices
Commission.</LD>
<LD>   In an order finalized Friday, the FPPC said, "Making campaign
contributions in other than one's own name is one of the more serious
violations of the [Political Reform] Act."</LD>
<TE>   Five employees of Fidelity donated $250 each to losing Anaheim
mayoral candidate Bob Zemel. Four others donated $250 each to
then-Assemblywoman Marilyn Brewer (R-Newport Beach).</TE>
<TE>   Zemel is vice president for public affairs of Fidelity National
Financial Inc., an affiliate of the title insurance company.</TE>
<TE>   Zemel, who served on the Anaheim City Council from 1994 to 1998,
lost the 1998 mayoral election to Tom Daly, receiving 40% of the
vote.</TE>
<TE>   Brewer, running in her last Assembly race before relinquishing her
seat because of term limits, was reelected with 77% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   According to the FPPC, Brewer carried an Assembly bill in which
Fidelity National had an interest.</TE>
<TE>   The FPPC order did not say whether any company employees had been
disciplined. The company could have been fined as much as $18,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Fidelity National senior vice president who signed the
stipulation declined to comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   He referred calls to the company's director of investor relations,
who could not be reached.</TE>

<LD>Summer is approaching--travel time--so, as a public service, this
column will be passing along vacation items today. First, Alyson Ross
of Alhambra advises that the lined-out sign she spotted south of
Paris does not mean that the French are prohibiting a certain kind of
group activity (see photo). The French? Are you kidding? No, it's
merely a notice to motorists that they are leaving the town of Orgy.</LD>
<LD>   I haven't heard of such a colorful town name since a reader wrote
about the English settlement of Barf.</LD>
<LD>   Barf (cont.): Ron Sinclair of Encino said that he and his wife
were preparing to board a ship in Martinique when they saw a sign
containing a term that sea voyagers don't like to think about (see
photo).</LD>
<TE>   Speaking of sea mishaps: After reading a fishing report, Art
Vinsel of San Pedro reminded anglers that they should always try to
avoid renting sinking boats (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   As for making reservations: With the travel slump, some companies

<TE>   And if you're taking yourself out to the ballgame: I want to warn
you that one of Dodger fans' most popular right-handed throwers is
seeing only limited duty. That's vendor Roger Owens, a 44-year
veteran famed for his behind-the-back tosses of peanut bags. Owens,
59, has been thrown for a bit of a loop himself by a case of vertigo.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting better, but right now I don't have clearance to work
in the stands," said Owens, who is taking medication to combat the
dizziness. Owens, who in years past would gallop up and down the
aisles of the left-field loge section like a billy goat, now works
the flat concourse, or concession, area. It's a tribute to Owens that
his admirers have been coming to him, including his season-peanut
holders.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, he's the only vendor I know of who has season-ticket fans
contract with him before the season to buy $5 bags of goobers for all
81 games. (He has 24 season-peanut seats.)</TE>
<TE>   "The fans have really lifted my spirits," Owens said. "And my arm
still feels good. No peanut elbow."</TE>

<HD>Woman Says Tale of Afghan Orphans False</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Culver City woman who claimed hundreds of Afghan women and children
are on their way to the United States now admits they don't exist.
Speaking through her husband, she apologized for "building up the
hopes in people wanting to adopt Afghan orphans."</LD>
<LD>   Julie Fahrer's descriptions of needy orphans at a meeting last
month spawned federal investigations and prompted scores of Afghan
families across the United States to sign up for foster-care
licenses, even though officials warned it was likely a hoax.</LD>
<LD>   But Monday, her story collapsed as her husband revealed that
Fahrer has a history of mental and emotional illness. Until a few
days ago, Neal Fahrer said he thought the illness had been treated
and believed his wife's statements that it was a "top-secret"
military issue.</LD>
<TE>   But after confronting her and chasing the same dead-end leads as
authorities, he realized it was a fabrication. He has sought a
psychological evaluation for her and will begin apologizing to the
churches, friends and associates to whom she has lied.</TE>
<TE>   "She created the orphans because of her emotional and mental
illness," said Neal Fahrer, who spoke for his wife because he said
she was in "no shape" to talk publicly. "She believed they existed,
but they did not. My conclusion is that she has relapsed into a
stressed emotional state of mind allowing these fantasies to exist
for her."</TE>
<TE>   For weeks, Julie Fahrer claimed the children's and women's arrival
was a high-level government secret. Some people still believe these
assertions, despite Julie Fahrer's admission she made the story up.
The United Nations, Immigration and Naturalization Services, the U.S.
State Department and the Afghan Embassy have denied knowledge of
Fahrer or the orphans. The FBI is continuing its investigation, a
spokeswoman said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very taken aback," said Dr. Shamim Ibrahim, president and
founder of a Muslim social-services agency. She attended Fahrer's
adoption meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody who was there, they all believed. If that is the truth
that she is mentally ill, I need some proof."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Julie Fahrer had created a new persona: that of a
United Nations representative working with refugees through her
organization, International Resources.</TE>
<TE>   She held monthly workshops with actors--some professional, others
aspiring--and, for a $15 application fee, promised to train them to
become "drama therapists" who would provide mock-refugee experiences
to doctors and psychologists on military bases and by traveling
worldwide for the U.N. and helping refugees. None of these promises
is true, Neal Fahrer said.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Fahrer's former pastor, Joan Stock, said she witnessed the
same pattern years ago when Fahrer made up stories to appear a
sympathetic figure. "It's a fantasy; it's also a fabrication," she
said. "She draws attention to herself as a compassionate, loving
person. I think she is that, but she needs to exaggerate to draw
attention to herself."</TE>
<TE>   Neal Fahrer said his wife truly believed her fantasy until finally
acknowledging that nobody would corroborate the story. "I think she
had to believe it to put in all the effort," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan-orphans story is a web of tales that Julie Fahrer went
to lengths to make seem real. On several occasions, she told
officials at University Christian Church--the church she rented space
from--that children would be arriving and asked them to beef up
security on the nights the orphans needed temporary housing. She even
spent nights away from home--purportedly because she was greeting the
children flown from Afghanistan by military transport.</TE>
<TE>   Then last month, she gathered a group of local Afghans and
interested colleagues for a meeting in a Van Nuys church. She told
them that 529 Afghan women and orphans were in the United States or
on their way and 45 of them had already been placed in homes
stretching from Fresno to San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   She passed out handwritten descriptions of several children. They
were realistic, including tragic-sounding psychological and physical
evaluations of children with "frequent crying episodes" or "severe
scars."</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan community immediately began mobilizing. Mohammad Daoud
Abedi, an Afghan American who lives in Calabasas, sent an e-mail
after attending the meeting with Julie Fahrer. The e-mail spread
rapidly through Afghan and Muslim Internet message boards.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of families responded, prompting calls to federal and
local agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Within a couple of weeks, local social-service groups began
holding meetings in San Jose, San Diego, Garden Grove and Grenada
Hills for prospective parents to begin foster-care licensing
procedures.</TE>
<TE>   The entire time, Julie Fahrer delivered no evidence of the
children's existence. No one at the church saw the orphans.</TE>
<TE>   Neal Fahrer described the past couple of weeks as "hell" as he
confronted his wife of 32 years and took a difficult look at the
facts.</TE>
<TE>   He recalled other stories about how she traveled to New York after
Sept. 11 to assist with World Trade Center victims--though she never
offered proof--and he recalled past fantasies, such as a time she
told people she was going blind. He called friends she said would
verify her story, but none could.</TE>
<TE>   "There was [a] realization of these fantasies and all the years
[that] had gone by," he said. "I don't consider myself a victim. I
consider myself a co-dependent.... Psychologically, it will be hard
to get back into the community and face the people we deal with
socially."</TE>
<TE>   He believes his wife committed no crime other than that of
disappointing people. She never took more than token sums of money,
people who worked with her said.</TE>
<TE>   Many believed her story for months or years--and continue to do
so.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she is covering up," Abedi said. "There are people that
don't want the truth to come out, and they might have pressured her
to say this."</TE>
<TE>   Like Abedi, Fahrer's friend Lynn Scardina accepts the explanations
Fahrer has given before--that the military and other agencies are
involved in these projects and that witnesses are backing away to
protect themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "I could have caught her in lies; I never have," Scardina said.
"She is a strong Christian woman. Her heart is always in the right
place.... In my heart of hearts, I think it's [the situation is] much
bigger."</TE>
<TE>   But actor Ty Granderson Jones of Hollywood said Monday he is angry
that he devoted a year of his time to Fahrer, trusted her, invited
her to his wedding and referred dozens of his acting friends to her
training program.</TE>
<TE>   He believes the program is a sham, but does not think Fahrer is
sick.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's their way out of trouble," he said.</TE>

<HD>Costa Mesa Priest Removed for '81 Abuse Allegation</HD>
<DH>Religion: A policeman said he saw Father Jerome Henson
molest a boy, 13, in a Northern California cemetery. The cleric's
superior then transferred him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County priest is on paid leave after being accused of
molesting a youth 21 years ago, allegations that include an account
by a police witness at the time.</LD>
<LD>   The police report on Father Jerome Henson includes comments from
his superior at his former Northern California parish, saying he had
been suspicious of the Roman Catholic priest's relationship with some
boys and would immediately move him to another parish.</LD>
<LD>   Henson, pastor of St. John the Baptist Church in Costa Mesa, is
now one of four Orange County priests to be removed from their
parishes in recent months over allegations of molesting minors.</LD>
<TE>   Diocese of Orange officials say their 4 1/2-month inquiry into the
Henson case has been hampered by their inability to interview the
alleged victim, who is now 34 and serving time at California State
Prison, Solano.</TE>
<TE>   Henson, a priest from the Dominican order, has denied the
allegations. Announcements this year about the accusations in church
bulletins at his last three parishes have sparked no additional
allegations, church officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Diocesan officials in Orange said they were first informed of the
allegations in October, when attorneys for the accuser, a former
altar boy, gave them the 1981 police report along with a letter
outlining other alleged molestations. The Orange Diocese put Henson
on leave in November. Full details of the case didn't emerge until
recently.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1981 report, a police sergeant in the Northern California
community of Benicia said that while driving by a cemetery there, he
saw the boy, then 13, in a compromising position with the priest.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a particularly egregious case because the conduct was
actually observed by the police," said David Drivon, an attorney for
the accuser.</TE>
<TE>   In the report, the Benicia sergeant said the suspect had committed
"lewd acts with a 13-year-old juvenile." He also called the boy an
"apparent willing participant," although that would not absolve the
adult of a crime.</TE>
<TE>   The sergeant, who recognized the boy as a soccer player he coached
and knew Henson as a priest in his parish, later wrote up the report.
The sergeant, now retired, couldn't be reached for comment to explain
why he didn't stop at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   In a follow-up interview at his home five days after the incident,
the boy denied anything improper had happened.</TE>
<TE>   Henson lawyer Gary Moorhead said the priest remembers cleaning up
grave sites with the boy but "adamantly denies that any inappropriate
contact happened."</TE>
<TE>   In the police report, the unnamed cleric who was Henson's superior
at St. Dominic Church in Benicia said he "has suspected [Henson] may
have been too involved with different young boys" and that he would
try to get the priest "transferred out of the community as soon as
possible and also have his assignments changed so that [Henson] will
be working with adults and not with so many boys."</TE>
<TE>   Later in the same afternoon that police first told the superior of
the case, he called police back and said "arrangements were made
today to immediately transfer" Henson to a parish in Reno, the report
stated.</TE>
<TE>   The accuser's attorney said he is in prison for residential
burglary and had served time for manslaughter when, trying to flee
police, he crashed into another car and killed a passenger.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the four priests in Orange County swept into the
nation's mushrooming sex scandal involving Roman Catholic clerics,
the Archdiocese of Los Angeles has dismissed 11 priests and
identified other suspected abusers no longer in the priesthood or
dead.</TE>
<TE>   When the Diocese of Orange hired Henson in 1983, church officials
said there was nothing in the priest's personnel file to indicate a
troubled past.</TE>
<TE>   Diocesan officials also say there have been no allegations against
Henson since he arrived. He worked at St. Angela Merici Church in
Brea and St. Anthony Claret Church in Anaheim before becoming pastor
at St. John the Baptist in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Western Province of Dominicans, Henson's order,
based in the Diocese of Sacramento, could not be reached for comment
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The accuser's attorney said he had considered Henson "a role
model, spiritual advisor and father figure" who took him on outings
and camping trips. In trouble with the law, the boy did community
service projects at the church, where he alleged that Henson first
molested him.</TE>

<HD>Panel OKs Bill to Protect Consumers' Privacy</HD>
<DH>Rights: Other measures seek to force solicitors to get
permission before billing credit cards after 'free' trials end.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A far-ranging measure to protect consumers' financial privacy that is
strongly supported by Gov. Gray Davis--but opposed by consumer
groups, banks and almost everyone in between--passed its first test
Monday in the California Assembly.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile on Monday, California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer and two
lawmakers unveiled legislation to eliminate a telemarketing sales
trick that consumer groups call deceptive.</LD>
<LD>   The measures--by Assembly members Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento)
and Ellen Corbett (D-San Leandro)--would target direct-mail and
telephone solicitors who coax individuals into agreeing to let them
receive a trial offer or information on a service without disclosing
the strings attached.</LD>
<TE>   Because consumers do not expressly provide their credit card
information, they often believe they have not agreed to pay for
anything. But in fact, many of the companies already have access to
consumers' billing information after purchasing it from banks and
others, or teaming up with them--and proceed to charge consumers when
the free part of the offer expires.</TE>
<TE>   "The deception is the person wasn't asked to bill the credit
card," Lockyer said. "They were never told" they would eventually
have to pay.</TE>
<TE>   The larger privacy legislation by Assemblyman Joe Nation (D-San
Rafael) cleared the Assembly Banking and Finance Committee. It
represents a sweeping effort by the Democratic governor to strengthen
privacy laws--a hot issue with voters--this election season. But it
would attempt to do so in far less comprehensive fashion than a
similar measure backed by liberal Democratic legislators.</TE>
<TE>   Nation's bill, AB 1775, would prevent banks and other financial
firms from selling or sharing clients' sensitive information with
third parties or affiliates for use in marketing nonfinancial
products without first gaining the person's approval. Information
considered sensitive includes the client's personal income, Social
Security and driver's license numbers and medical bills.</TE>
<TE>   But the legislation also would allow such firms to continue
selling or sharing less sensitive nonpublic personal information,
including phone numbers, unless consumers chose to opt out of the
arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   That is the current disclosure standard under federal law--and the
preferred method for banks, which believe the onus for privacy should
be placed on the consumer--though the Nation bill would apply it to
more information than federal laws.</TE>
<TE>   To better notify the public of its right to privacy, the measure
would require financial firms to provide all affected clients with
clearly written notices outlining their ability to protect their
information from being shared--a major change from banks' current
disclosure statements, which have been widely criticized as
intentionally incomprehensible.</TE>
<TE>   "If you as a consumer want to restrict all information about you,
including your name, address and phone number, you can do that" under
the legislation, Nation told the committee on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   A stronger measure by state Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough)
that would require banks to obtain written permission from consumers
before selling or trading any financial information failed to win
approval in the Assembly last year.</TE>
<TE>   It fizzled in the final hours of the legislative session largely
due to opposition from Davis and a bloc of moderate Democratic
lawmakers including Nation, but remains alive.</TE>
<TE>   Nation said he has met twice this year with Davis to draft a more
moderate privacy measure, and has come up with a middle-of-the-road
approach that he believes is the best balance between consumer groups
and business interests.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone is going to be happy" with the final
product, Nation said. "No one is going to say, 'Wow, what a great
bill.'"</TE>
<TE>   But the measure is opposed by all consumer groups and all business
interests. It is also opposed by Republicans and liberal Democrats,
and only has the backing of business-friendly Democratic legislators.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's hearing was packed with leading Sacramento lobbyists for
business interests ranging from banks and insurance companies to
credit unions and credit card companies.</TE>
<TE>   "All sides are on the same side," James Clark of the California
Bankers Assn. told the committee Monday. "They're just not happy."</TE>

<HD>Davis May Fail to Meet School Funding Target</HD>
<DH>Education: Governor hints that coming budget might not
attain campus spending levels required under Proposition 98.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN and JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis warned for the first time Monday that he may not be
able to meet the "guaranteed" funding level for schools required by
the voter-approved Proposition 98.</LD>
<LD>   Trying to dampen expectations as he confronts a major budget
deficit in an election year, Davis suggested to a union of
nonteaching school employees that education spending could grow at a
slower rate next year than he previously proposed.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm going to do my level best to meet the Proposition 98
guarantee," Davis told the California School Employees Assn. "I
cannot absolutely commit to you I will do that. That is my goal."</LD>
<TE>   In his January budget proposal, Davis called for $46 billion in
state and local spending on public schools in 2002-03, a $1.2-billion
increase over this year's amount and enough, he said, to meet the
requirement of the complex Proposition 98 formula.</TE>
<TE>   However, the nonpartisan legislative analyst calculated that Davis
underestimated the requirement and would need to boost spending by
$825 million to meet the minimum guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   Now, facing a shortfall most recently estimated at $17.5 billion,
Davis is trying to soften what may be a coming blow.</TE>
<TE>   "When we have good years, we ... do lots of things to reward the
good work you do," Davis told the audience. "And when there are hard
years, we have to do what everyone in the private sector
does--tighten their belt."</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic governor, who repeatedly has said schools are his
highest priority, will release a revised budget proposal in mid-May,
after officials tally income-tax receipts filed by Monday's deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 98, approved by voters in 1988, requires that about
35% of the state's general fund be spent on public schools, from
kindergarten though community college. In his first three years in
office, Davis allocated $2 billion more than the minimum requirement.</TE>
<TE>   Davis did not suggest that he plans to cut school spending.
Rather, the rate of increase might not be as steep as it has been.
Nor did Davis specifically say he would seek to suspend Proposition
98's requirements, a move that would require a two-thirds majority
vote in the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   But the possibility of such a move was enough to put some school
officials and the head of the powerful California Teachers Assn. on
guard.</TE>
<TE>   "Proposition 98 has never been suspended before, even with
Republican governors during really bad economic times," CTA President
Wayne Johnson said. "We certainly want to be reasonable. But
[suspending Proposition 98] would probably cause a great deal of
problems within the California Teachers Assn."</TE>
<TE>   If Davis proposes downward adjustments in school spending, he
likely will face a major fight, with some of his key constituents on
the other side. In the early 1990s, Gov. Pete Wilson became the
target of a major television ad campaign when he suggested cuts in
school spending.</TE>
<TE>   "In addition to the TV ad blitz," recalled Dan Schnur, then
Wilson's spokesman, "the union instructed its members to have second-
and third-grade children write letters to the governor begging him
not to fire their teachers. When the CTA is angry, they are an
awesome political force to behold."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' relations with the 300,000-member teachers' union already
are strained. Johnson last week criticized Davis for opposing a bill
to give teachers collective bargaining rights for decisions over
textbooks and other issues related to curricula. Davis reaffirmed his
opposition to the measure, which faces its first hearing today.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I can figure is that he sees some political
advantage to it," Johnson said. "I only assume that he's thinking
that unions per se aren't popular."</TE>
<TE>   Davis last week signaled in an appearance before the California
Assn. of School Business Officials that there could be some leveling
off in the rate of spending increases for public schools, said Kevin
Gordon, executive director of the organization.</TE>
<TE>   "It was inevitable the question would come up," Gordon said. "How
together can we make sure investments for education are protected ...
without bankrupting the rest of the state? We have to be reasonable."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon said school business officials believe a suspension of
Proposition 98 is preferable to other steps, such as counting some
child-care expenses as part of the schools' pot of money.</TE>
<TE>   However, Los Angeles Unified School District Supt. Roy Romer said
he believes meeting Proposition 98's minimum guarantee is "critical."</TE>
<TE>   "We want to maintain the level of progress that [Davis] wants to
make and we want to make," Romer said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Davis did not elaborate on the education trims he may be
contemplating, he did say he plans to fully cover costs related to
rising enrollment and other cost-of-living adjustments.</TE>

<HD>PUC Unveils Plan for PG&amp;E</HD>
<DH>Bankruptcy: Customers would pay $4.7 billion to help
restore utility's fiscal health. The firm, activists are both
critical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>State regulators unveiled a reorganization plan for Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric Co. on Monday that calls for customers to pay $4.7
billion--or $1.4 billion more than the stockholders would--to restore
the company to financial health.</LD>
<LD>   But the California Public Utilities Commission contends that its
plan filed in federal Bankruptcy Court avoids $13.5 billion in higher
energy and other costs associated with PG&amp;E's own plan.</LD>
<LD>   PG&amp;E issued a statement saying that the PUC plan is unworkable and
tries to illegally suspend stockholder profits for more than two
years, harming company retirees.</LD>
<TE>   PUC officials said they hope their plan passes muster with
Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali and is allowed to compete for the
votes of creditors in June.</TE>
<TE>   Commission General Counsel Gary Cohen said the plan would repay
creditors in full, return PG&amp;E to financial viability by January and
help the state get out of the power-buying business. "There should be
enough room under the current rates for a [rate] decrease in early
2003," he said.</TE>
<TE>   High Rates Would Continue</TE>
<TE>   Although wholesale electricity prices have receded, both plans
maintain the record high customer rates the PUC established a year
ago during the energy crisis. And that has consumer groups furious.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it the responsibility of consumers to restore this company to
creditworthiness?" said Mindy Spatt, spokeswoman for the Utility
Reform Network. "The answer is no."</TE>
<TE>   The PUC plan says PG&amp;E's customers would pay $2.7 billion more
than the cost of providing their power through January. The customers
also would pay $2 billion in interest costs associated with new debt
acquired by PG&amp;E.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E stockholders would contribute $3.35 billion, including $1.6
billion in earnings from the utility and $1.75 billion from the sale
of PG&amp;E stock.</TE>
<TE>   The stock sale, the PUC said, would dilute the ownership stake of
PG&amp;E's parent company in the utility.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E Wants to Shift Assets</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors last April,
saying that it had run up $9 billion in energy-related debts.</TE>
<TE>   The company's reorganization plan would shift transmission and
generation assets to other subsidiaries of its parent, PG&amp;E Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights filed
suit in the state Supreme Court, alleging that the PUC was violating
state law by submitting a reorganization plan that uses ratepayer
money to pay for previous energy purchases.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the Santa Monica-based group condemned the PUC plan as
a $4.7-billion bailout.</TE>

<HD>Experts Agree on Survival Time After Shooting</HD>
<DH>Trial: Defense and prosecution witnesses both say Megan
Barroso could have lived long enough to be raped.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Echoing the opinions of a prosecution witness, a defense expert in
bullet wounds told a judge Monday that slain Moorpark College student
Megan Barroso could have lived for minutes to hours after being shot
in the abdomen last summer.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Martin Fackler, a former military surgeon, testified that
because of decomposition it is difficult to determine how long
Barroso may have survived after being shot with an AK-47 assault
rifle while driving home July 5.</LD>
<LD>   The fatal bullet ripped through the driver-side door and hit the
20-year-old woman in the left side. Three bullet fragments were found
during an autopsy after her body was found in a ravine near Simi
Valley a month after the shooting.</LD>
<TE>   The question of how long Barroso lived after being shot is a key
issue in the case against murder suspect Vincent Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   A 31-year-old Simi Valley handyman, Sanchez could face the death
penalty if prosecutors prove that he killed Barroso during a
kidnapping and rape attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys, who concede that Sanchez shot Barroso, contend
that she probably died before a rape could have occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, pathologist Richard Mason testified that Barroso could
have lived for as little as 15 minutes or as long as two days,
depending on whether the bullet fragments hit her aorta or kidney.</TE>
<TE>   Fackler also said that Barroso could have died within 15 minutes
if bullet fragments hit those areas but could have lived for several
days if they lodged in the bowel.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Mason, Fackler said Barroso could have slipped into
unconsciousness immediately and died sometime after.</TE>
<TE>   On cross-examination, he said Barroso probably would have survived
if she had received immediate medical attention.</TE>
<TE>   In other testimony Monday, a crime scene investigator testified
about knives and ski masks found in the homes of several rape victims
who Sanchez has admitted attacking between 1996 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   And a Simi Valley detective involved in those investigations
testified that police seized videotapes from Sanchez's home that
depict him sexually assaulting two women.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony is scheduled to resume today in Ventura County Superior
Court.</TE>

<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors seeking to have Cary Stayner executed for allegedly
killing three Yosemite tourists won a significant victory Monday when
a judge ruled that Stayner's confessions can be used in his upcoming
trial.</LD>
<LD>   His attorneys argued that the FBI should have stopped questioning
Stayner after he initially declined to talk, and that agents coerced
him into admitting he had killed a Yosemite park guide and the
tourists. They also said Stayner was pressured into talking to
reporter Ted Rowlands and was not properly advised of his right to
remain silent.</LD>
<LD>   However, Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Thomas Hastings
said there was "not a scintilla of evidence" that Stayner
involuntarily confessed.</LD>
<TE>   Jury selection is set to begin June 10, with the trial due to
start in mid-July.</TE>

<HD>Gunman Kills 3 at Health Clinic</HD>
<DH>Violence: Witnesses say X-ray technician turned the gun on
himself after shooting two medical workers and a doctor. A patient
says he was 'acting weird.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON and ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An X-ray technician shot a doctor and two other medical personnel to
death and killed himself Monday afternoon at the clinic where they
all worked in the City of Commerce, sheriff's deputies said.</LD>
<LD>   Patients at the Superior Medical Clinic fled to the street as the
gunfire erupted, taking refuge behind parked cars and in nearby
buildings. They said at least seven shots were fired before the
gunman fell dead.</LD>
<LD>   The doctor, family specialist Lucia Caridad Lorenzo, 43, died of
multiple gunshot wounds about two hours after the attack, said
officials at County-USC Medical Center.</LD>
<TE>   Two other employees, registered nurse Patricia Oglesby, 49, of
Pico Rivera and Roxanne Ruiz, 25, of East Los Angeles, believed to
have been a medical assistant, died at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies did not identify the gunman, other than to say he was 51
years old, but witnesses described him as a usually affable man named
Eddie who had worked at the clinic on Olympic Boulevard for at least
six years.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they had no explanation for the 1:20 p.m. rampage.</TE>
<TE>   Aurora Guerrero, 34, said the X-ray technician, who had treated
her for years, had been scheduled to take pictures of her shoulder
Monday. She said she, her husband and their three young children were
waiting for her appointment when she saw the technician walk by.</TE>
<TE>   "Eddie was acting weird," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Normally gregarious, he was silent and stone-faced, Guerrero said.</TE>
<TE>   She said that instead of his medical uniform, he was dressed in
street clothes. And she found it odd that the trash can he was
carrying to a dumpster was empty, even before he dumped it.</TE>
<TE>   She said that when he returned, she called out to him: "Eddie!
Don't take a break until you do me!"</TE>
<TE>   Uncharacteristically, he didn't respond, Guerrero said. Instead,
he pushed past her and walked down a hall to the reception desk at
the front of the yellow stucco building. Seconds later, she heard
gunshots.</TE>
<TE>   "After the third shot, I ran," Guerrero said.</TE>
<TE>   She said her husband grabbed one of the children, she grabbed the
other two and they all dashed out the rear entrance.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Esparza, 23, who works at a tire repair shop across the
street, said, "People were running out of the place with their kids,
screaming and looking for a place to hide. Some of them got behind
cars."</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero and two of her children ran into a restaurant, where the
three of them barricaded themselves in a small closet.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, Guerrero said, a man seeking refuge pounded on the
locked door.</TE>
<TE>   "Please, just take my baby," the man shouted.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero said she opened the door and squeezed the infant--and its
car seat--into the closet with her and her two children.</TE>
<TE>   Emeria Saldana, 39, who had an appointment at the clinic, said she
arrived just as deputies' patrol cars rolled up to the door.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw blood," she said. "I saw a body in the doorway."</TE>
<TE>   Deputies sealed off a wide area around the clinic. People who
feared that a relative might be among the shooting victims gathered
outside police lines for hours, waiting for information from
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   The clinic has been in the working-class community southeast of
Los Angeles for seven years. Located in a strip mall with a Chinese
food restaurant and a Domino's Pizza, the clinic is a general family
practice with a specialty in prenatal care.</TE>
<TE>   Client Gina Moreno, 36, of Commerce said Lorenzo "was just the
best. She never turned people away because they couldn't pay. She
would say, 'Pay me however you can.'"</TE>
<TE>   Friends said that Oglesby supplemented her nursing work with a job
at a fast-food restaurant to support her four children.</TE>

<HD>City's Hiring of Relative Is Questioned</HD>
<DH>Oxnard: Son-in-law of the chief administrator is awarded a
management job after being rejected as a finalist. Personnel director
was asked to review qualifications.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The son-in-law of Oxnard City Manager Edmund F. Sotelo was hired as a
computer systems manager this month after Sotelo asked the city
personnel director to reconsider the man's qualifications for the
$61,000-a-year post.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas Clock, 36, a former computer network administrator for the
Los Angeles Dodgers, initially failed to make the list of 10
finalists to direct a four-person unit of city computer specialists.
But he was placed in contention after Sotelo asked Human Resources
Director Lino Corona to review Clock's qualifications, Corona said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Corona said Sotelo never directed him to make Clock a
finalist--just to review his resume.</LD>
<TE>   "It was my personal opinion, and I stand by it, that Mr. Clock was
probably as well qualified as many of the people we had already
invited for interviews," Corona said. "I've thought about this and,
you know, I'd do everything exactly the same way."</TE>
<TE>   Sotelo said that he had nothing to do with hiring Clock, and that
no favoritism was shown when Sotelo's assistant city manager made the
hire. Clock reported to work April 2.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked Lino to review the process," Sotelo said. "I wanted just
to make sure the process was fair and equitable. No more, no less."</TE>
<TE>   Sotelo said that Clock was qualified for the management position
and that he had been inappropriately eliminated from consideration.
But Sotelo said he didn't tell Corona to do anything to help Clock.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had said specifically do this, that or the other, that would
have been different," Sotelo said. "I said review the process."</TE>
<TE>   Corona said he then reviewed the qualifications of the other 10
finalists and compared them with Clock's and with the minimum
qualifications required by the city.</TE>
<TE>   Clock had apparently been culled along with 11 other applicants
because he has had only 4 1/2 years of full-time computer experience,
and the minimum required by the city was five years.</TE>
<TE>   But Corona said Clock's work with computers as a Ralphs
supermarket manager should have been counted, as well as his
bachelor's degree in business administration with a computer
specialization.</TE>
<TE>   "When I made that determination, I sat down with the person from
information systems who was involved with the initial screening,"
Corona said. "I had her review the application again, and I asked
her, 'Do you think he is as qualified as some of the people we have
invited?' Her assessment was, 'Yeah, I don't have any problem if we
invite him.'"</TE>
<TE>   At that point, Corona said, he told the reviewer, Tara Willis,
that Clock is Sotelo's son-in law.</TE>
<TE>   Willis, another computer systems administrator, said she initially
thought Clock was too inexperienced, but changed her mind after
reconsidering his experience as a trainer of Ralphs employees on how
to use store computers.</TE>
<TE>   Once his candidacy was revived, Clock was ranked first among the
11 finalists by a panel of three computer experts--two from other
cities and one from the Oxnard Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   A second review panel of city managers, including Willis,
Assistant City Manager Karen Burnham and Deputy City Manager Grace
Magistrale Hoffman, also ranked him first.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman recommended Clock's hiring and Burnham implemented it.</TE>
<TE>   "We were looking for someone with strong administrative skills as
well as technical skills," Willis said.</TE>
<TE>   "And Tom had the most administrative skills," Willis added. "I
think he met the qualifications."</TE>
<TE>   The final panel was not immediately satisfied, however.</TE>
<TE>   And Willis and Burnham said there was some discussion of starting
over in hopes of attracting a stronger field of candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we reached a consensus to reopen it," Willis said, "and
then that was rethought and we decided to go ahead and hire. It
wasn't my decision, so I can't comment on that."</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Gary Gillig said no state laws or city ordinances
prohibit close relatives from working for the same city, as long as
one is not a direct supervisor of the other.</TE>
<TE>   Sotelo is two management levels removed from direct oversight of
Clock.</TE>
<TE>   But a spokesman for the union representing most of Oxnard's
computer division employees criticized Sotelo for intervening.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the hallmarks of government in California has been the
fact that most people are hired based on the merit system, and it
bothers me when people who don't measure up are put on a list for
what appears to be less than merit factors," said Barry Hammitt of
Service Employees International Union.</TE>
<TE>   Hammitt said the key question is whether the other candidates were
treated the same as Clock.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes it pretty hard to look at the credibility of anything
they do at this point," he said. "Everybody who competes for a job
should have an equal opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Clock said his experience with computers
qualifies him for his new job.</TE>
<TE>   He saw the position posted on the Internet, and with a newborn
son, he and wife, Bernadette, thought it was time to move from
Norwalk to the suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was not aware that Sotelo had spoken with Corona about
his application.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he doesn't think he was hired because of favoritism.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a real good authority on that issue right now," he said.
"I just submitted an application and waited to hear."</TE>

<LD>   The track, which was built in the dry lake bed without county,
state or federal permits, probably will be out of business by summer
because of a local water district's pending agreement to store more
water at the lake.</LD>
<LD>   A draft agreement to import as much as 5,000 acre-feet of
"emergency water" for at least two years was completed April 5
between the Serrano Water District and the Metropolitan Water
District.</LD>
<TE>   A final version could be signed by month's end.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Metropolitan Water District agreement is signed, which I'm
pretty sure it will be, they [the track] will be out of business,"
said David Noyes, general manager of the Serrano Water District,
which co-owns the lake with the Irvine Ranch Water District and
currently manages recreational activities there with the Irvine Co.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on how fast water is piped in, the track "could be out
of operation as early as July, or as late as September," Noyes said.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Etter, a co-owner of the off-road motorcycle racetrack, said
that although he had always known there was a risk the course would
be submerged, he still was hoping to stay open, depending on how much
and how fast emergency water was brought in. "The water district's
No. 1 purpose is water," Etter said. "We've recognized since Day One
that we're in a lake bottom. We're aware that the water district is
going to have to bring in more for emergency levels, but I don't
think it's been determined what effect that will have on us."</TE>
<TE>   Noyes said that although he would like to see the track continue,
there was little chance it could stay open once the full emergency
supply is brought in.</TE>
<TE>   He said if there were extremely cool weather this summer, or if a
pipe break or outage somewhere else caused MWD to use the emergency
Irvine Lake water, there is a slim chance the track could be saved.</TE>
<TE>   More likely, piping in so much water will flood the course, which
was bulldozed around willow tree stands in a sandy, dry arm of the
lake off Santiago Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   Track Had Been Billed as Temporary</TE>
<TE>   The track, which opened in September, was billed from the start as
a temporary operation. Winter rains were expected to wash it away,
but one of the driest winters in decades extended the season far
longer than expected. The lake now is less than half full, Noyes
said.</TE>
<TE>   Etter and the other owners would now like to see the course open
on an annual basis during the dry season, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The track, which runs five days a week, draws hundreds of weekend
riders from across the region who have vocally defended its right to
operate.</TE>
<TE>   But it has been criticized by area activists and county planners,
who say it was built and opened without proper county, state and
federal reviews.</TE>
<TE>   Serrano Water district officials and the track operators have
argued they are operating legally under the lakes' 1941 general
recreational permit.</TE>
<TE>   County planning officials briefly shut the site down last fall,
saying grading and environmental permits had not been obtained before
construction. The county issued temporary use permits from November
through February, after a grading and erosion plan was submitted.
Those permits have expired, but the track remained open, awaiting
discussion and a possible vote by the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman said the agency has asked
Saddleback Motors to complete studies this spring on possible
improper loss of the endangered gnatcatcher.</TE>
<TE>   Etter said those studies were being completed. He said that since
the track was completely in the lake bed, there was no habitat for
species that could have been lost.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Co., which originally built Irvine Lake, alternates
management of recreational activities there with the Serrano Water
District, and shares profits. The company plans to build as many as
4,000 homes in the vicinity, but a spokesman declined to say whether
it would like the racetrack to continue long-term.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know if this would be compatible with development plans
or not," said John Christensen. "But that question is probably moot
now given the impending water management situation with Serrano and
MWD."</TE>
<TE>   MWD sells water to smaller districts across Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Noyes said storing more water at the lake would improve water
quality and guarantee a closer emergency supply for Orange County. He
said fishing and boating on the lake will not only continue but
improve.</TE>
<TE>   The Serrano Water District, which serves Villa Park and certain
parts of Orange, already is importing water into the lake because of
the extremely dry winter, at the rate of about a foot a day.</TE>
<TE>   But that is not expected to affect the racetrack.</TE>

<HD>Jobless Benefits Put on Slower Track</HD>
<DH>Legislature: Assembly approves retroactive help for those
who lost work after Sept. 11, but GOP foes stall payments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- Assembly Democrats on Monday voted to provide
unemployment benefits retroactively to Californians thrown out of
work by Sept. 11 terrorist acts, but Republican opponents succeeded
in delaying payments to the jobless for months to come.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, sponsored by Gov. Gray Davis, was returned to the Senate
on a party-line vote for expected routine approval of Assembly
changes, the final stop before it reaches the governor for signature.
The vote was 48 to 12.</LD>
<LD>   But state Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar), author of SB 2, said
the Republican action in the Assembly means that about 1.15 million
eligible workers will not receive payments immediately and, instead,
may have to wait until mid-August.</LD>
<TE>   He said the delay will affect not only Democratic labor union
members but newly graduated college students and such typical
Republican constituents as stock brokerage employees and airline
office workers.</TE>
<TE>   "The largest segment of the unemployed is within the professional
white-collar classes," Alarcon said.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, an election-year priority for Davis, would extend
recently increased unemployment benefits to Californians who lost
their jobs between Sept. 11 and Jan. 7, regardless of whether the
losses related directly or indirectly to the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those were ineligible to receive the $100 weekly increase
in jobless payments that took effect Jan. 7 because their
unemployment occurred in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The bill originally proposed increases for only about 15,000
Californians thrown out of work by the attacks, mostly airline and
tourism industry workers.</TE>
<TE>   Strongly supported by the California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO,
the Alarcon measure was expanded to include every qualified worker
who became unemployed after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very fair bill. It's the least we can do for those
people," Assemblyman Thomas Calderon (D-Montebello) argued during
Assembly debate.</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans lined up in solid opposition, warning that the
state's unemployment insurance trust fund, financed by employer
taxes, is heading for insolvency just to pay the higher benefits
enacted by the Legislature last year.</TE>
<TE>   Passage of the retroactive payments bill would aggravate the
issue, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the space of three months, that trust fund has dropped from
$6.2 billion to $4.2 billion," said Assemblyman Bill Campbell
(R-Villa Park).</TE>
<TE>   As a result, employers soon will have to pay higher rates, which
could cause some to go out of business, he said.</TE>

<HD>Parking Ticket Appeals Office Has Seen It All</HD>
<DH>Most visitors are polite, but some excuses get wild and
tempers flare. Staff is tough, trained not to let emotions rule.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A thick wall of bulletproof glass and a beefy armed security guard
may sound a bit excessive for a nondescript Los Angeles city office
where motorists appeal parking tickets and beseech hearing officers
to release their towed cars.</LD>
<LD>   But the office can bring out the worst in its visitors. Here,
police officers, priests and U.S. Secret Service agents have tried to
use their positions to get out of tickets. Some of those who come to
protest end up begging. Others cry or plead. And some tip over chairs
or slam their fists into the furniture.</LD>
<LD>   So hearing officers have learned to hope for the best, but to be
ready for anything.</LD>
<TE>   Consider the recent hearing for Cleofus Grant, whose Dodge sedan
was recently towed off an East Los Angeles street because of nine
outstanding parking tickets, totaling more than $700 in fines.</TE>
<TE>   He was cool when he sat down in front of hearing officer Sukhbir
Mathew at the parking adjudication office behind Los Angeles City
Hall. Grant argued that most of the tickets were issued before he
bought the car in February.</TE>
<TE>   Mathew, a law school graduate and mother-to-be, responded that
parking enforcement officials had no records that he had registered
the car in his name.</TE>
<TE>   Grant began to seethe. "Why do you have stupid ... people working
for you?" he bellowed.</TE>
<TE>   After Grant showed proof that he bought the car in February,
Mathew agreed to waive the eight tickets issued under the previous
owner. But she said Grant still owed $25 for having an expired
registration and $35 to remove the Denver boot that parking officials
locked to the car's left front wheel.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Grant blew up. He cursed, demanded his paperwork and
stormed out of the office, blasting Mathew with profanity.</TE>
<TE>   Mathew shrugged it off. An occupational hazard.</TE>
<TE>   In the 10 years since the state Legislature transferred parking
citation appeals out of the municipal courts and gave the
responsibility to local city officials, Mathew and her colleagues in
the city's parking adjudication unit have just about seen it all.</TE>
<TE>   Most people who appeal parking tickets are civil and friendly. But
in addition to those who become emotional, there are those who try
all manner of defenses, including poverty.</TE>
<TE>   "This little bit of money means a great deal to me--a parking
meter payment, diapers for my unborn child, a taco with extra
cheese," one West Hollywood woman recently wrote. "Sorry for the
humor," she added. "My life is so pathetic--I need it."</TE>
<TE>   The appeal was rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Given the place that cars hold in the life of Southern California,
parking officers and others understand why drivers go to great
lengths to protect their driving privileges. After all, a car is
about as essential in Southern California as snowshoes are in Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a nasty situation when someone's car is picked up," said Jay
Carsman, the city's parking systems coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   But Los Angeles parking adjudication officers are a tough lot, who
are trained not to let emotions cloud the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be compassionate toward them, but at the same time
you are regulated by the laws of the city," said Mathew, who has
worked as an adjudication officer for nearly five years.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, she and 20 other hearing officers in Los Angeles hear
about 22,000 parking ticket appeals and 3,600 requests to release
vehicles that are towed and impounded.</TE>
<TE>   About 60% of the appeals are rejected, Carsman said. When hearing
officers grant an appeal, it is for a few specific circumstances, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the hearing officers can erase a ticket if a parking
sign is missing or vandalized. Citations also can be removed if a
motorist parked illegally because of a medical emergency or a
mechanical failure.</TE>
<TE>   But even then, the car owners must provide the proof for such
exceptions, either with photographs or the sworn testimony of
witnesses. In parking adjudication hearings, it is guilty until
proven innocent.</TE>
<TE>   For example, hearing officer T. Taylor said a Catholic priest
recently appealed a parking ticket, arguing that he stopped in a
no-parking zone because he had to administer the last rites to a
dying man. The priest, who appeared at the hearing wearing his white
collar and black suit, offered no other proof but his sworn
testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor is still mulling over his ruling, but he said he is leaning
toward rejecting the priest's appeal.</TE>
<TE>   For hearing officers, some appeals can be emotionally draining.</TE>
<TE>   Adjudication officer Jean Tyree, who was a parking enforcement
officer for 20 years, said she received a written appeal of a parking
ticket from a woman who rambled on for five pages about her medical
problems and the untimely death of her sister. "This one wore me
out," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tyree and her colleagues have also heard many excuses that they
have found easy to dismiss.</TE>
<TE>   One woman, for instance, had 40 tickets, mostly for parking in
front of her house on the days the street was swept. She argued that
it was too tiring to get up to move the car.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was the petite motorist who received a parking
citation and argued that the parking sign was too high for her to
read.</TE>
<TE>   Several motorists have argued that they should be permitted to
park in no-parking zones if no other spaces are available or if their
hazard lights are flashing.</TE>
<TE>   Mario Rocha, a disabled senior citizen who has arthritis, recently
appealed a $276 ticket for parking his Dodge van in a bus zone while
picking up his wife at a Los Angeles bus station.</TE>
<TE>   Rocha said the porter at the bus station told him it was OK to
park in the bus zone because there were no parking spaces for the
disabled.</TE>
<TE>   "I swear to God it's true what I'm saying," Rocha told Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor was not swayed. He said a bus station porter cannot
overrule city parking laws.</TE>
<TE>   Rocha then took out a $68 check from the Social Security
Administration. He said it was his only income for the month.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, a law school graduate who plans to take the bar exam in
July, was unmoved. He told Rocha that he would receive his final
ruling in the mail. If Rocha could not afford to pay the ticket,
Taylor said, he would put him on a three-month payment plan.</TE>
<TE>   "If they want to, they can put me in jail for two or three
months," Rocha said. "I still can't pay."</TE>
<TE>   After Rocha left the office, Taylor explained why he resisted just
giving the man a break. Leafing through Rocha's file, Taylor said the
bus station ticket was not Rocha's first.</TE>
<TE>   "He is parking everywhere," Taylor said. "He is parking in the red
zone, in the yellow zone. He is parking everywhere except where he is
supposed to park."</TE>

<HD>Byron White, 84; Ex-Supreme Court Justice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Retired Supreme Court Justice Byron R. White, whose fame as a college
football great and star of the National Football League helped propel
him to a long career on the nation's highest court, died of
complications of pneumonia Monday in Denver at age 84. He was the
last living former Supreme Court justice.</LD>
<LD>   When White stepped down from the court in 1993, he was lauded for
31 years of service as a hard-working, no-nonsense jurist who steered
a middle course and avoided broad pronouncements of law.</LD>
<LD>   Appointed an associate justice in 1962 by President Kennedy, White
supported the Supreme Court's drive to end racial segregation and to
strengthen civil rights. He was not a conventional liberal, however.</LD>
<TE>   Throughout his career, White defied labeling as a jurist--and he
would have had it no other way. A thoroughgoing skeptic, he steered
clear of what he saw as ideologues on the left or the right. He just
decided cases and did so in terse opinions.</TE>
<TE>   "Judges have an exaggerated view of their role," said White, who
usually balked when his colleagues broke new ground.</TE>
<TE>   His strongest opinions, in fact, were issued in dissent. He
disagreed when the court's majority declared that criminal suspects
have a right to remain silent in the Miranda ruling of 1966, and when
it struck down laws restricting abortion in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   He condemned the Roe vs. Wade decision as "an improvident and
extravagant exercise ... of raw judicial power." He never accepted
the right to abortion as a precedent and voted regularly to overrule
it.</TE>
<TE>   His landmark opinions were remarkably few. One exception was the
1986 case of Bowers vs. Hardwick, a ruling that has been widely
condemned by constitutional scholars. Speaking for a 5-4 majority,
White upheld Georgia's law that made homosexual sex a crime. To argue
that the Constitution's right to privacy includes such conduct "is at
best facetious," White wrote.</TE>
<TE>   White was a well-respected figure and powerful influence within
the court.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist called him "a good colleague
and a great friend. He came as close as anyone I have ever known to
meriting Matthew Arnold's description of Sophocles: 'He saw life
steadily and saw it whole.' All of us who served with him will miss
him."</TE>
<TE>   Justice John Paul Stevens met White at Pearl Harbor, where both
were naval officers during World War II. "His friendship is one of
the treasures of this tour of duty," he said. "He was the kind of
person for whom respect, admiration and affection continue to
increase as you learn more about him."</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who ever met Byron White will recall his painfully firm
handshake. You had to squeeze back hard or he would hurt you," said
Justice Antonin Scalia, who joined the court when White was 69. "I
always thought that was an apt symbol for his role on this court....
If there is one adjective that never could, never would, be applied
to Byron White, it is wishy-washy."</TE>
<TE>   "Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends,"
President Bush said in a statement. "Justice White was a
distinguished jurist who served his country with honor and
dedication."</TE>
<TE>   White's resignation in 1993 cleared the way for the first
Democratic appointee to the high court in a quarter-century.
President Clinton chose Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the second woman
appointed to the court, to fill White's seat.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his long tenure on the Supreme Court and the many
controversies he encountered, the justice never quite escaped his
youthful legend as "Whizzer" White, one of the great college players
of the 1930s and one of the first stars of the National Football
League.</TE>
<TE>   Byron Raymond White was born June 8, 1917, near Wellington, Colo.,
a small town at the base of the Rocky Mountains whose principal crop
was sugar beets.</TE>
<TE>   Though his father ran a lumberyard, young Byron--from the time he
began first grade--made extra money by pulling beets, work that he
said built his powerful arms.</TE>
<TE>   He graduated first in his high school class, which earned him a
scholarship to the University of Colorado in Boulder. Football was
just a sidelight, he said, definitely secondary to academics. But in
his senior year, he led Colorado to an undefeated season. A 6-foot-1
halfback, he had the speed to run around defenders but preferred to
run over them.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy had the strongest forearms and chest development I ever
saw. He was hard as iron all over," said Frank Potts, an assistant
coach during White's era. "He could blast tacklers out of the way
with the forearm ... He wasn't dirty, just mean."</TE>
<TE>   As a rusher and punt returner, White averaged 246 yards per game,
a record that lasted for 51 years. He played defense as well.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his football glory, White kept his campus job, doing
kitchen duty at a fraternity house. He made the All-American football
team and led his basketball team to the National Invitation
Tournament in New York, then the equivalent of today's NCAA Final
Four.</TE>
<TE>   In the spring, White wired his parents with the even bigger news
that he had won a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford. But he also was
offered $15,800--then the league's highest salary--to play pro
football for the Pittsburgh Pirates (now the Pittsburgh Steelers).</TE>
<TE>   "How can I refuse an offer like that? It will pay my way through
law school," he said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Torn, he persuaded Oxford to delay his admission until January,
and he used the fall months to lead the NFL in rushing.</TE>
<TE>   During his time in England, he became friends with the son of U.S.
Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy. Byron White and Jack Kennedy were
contemporaries--born just 10 days apart--and traveled together.</TE>
<TE>   They looked to be an odd pair. White was burly and quiet, while
Kennedy was painfully thin and gregarious. White, of course, was
famous back home, while young Kennedy was seen as the playboy son of
a rich American.</TE>
<TE>   They were both skeptics, and White enjoyed Kennedy's sarcastic
sense of humor. Kennedy was "the most fun-producing man I ever met,"
White once recalled.</TE>
<TE>   White spent two terms at Oxford, returning to the United States
because of the threat of war. He spent the next two years at Yale Law
School. To his fellow students, he resembled Superman: On weekdays,
he was Clark Kent, a quiet, studious figure in steel-rimmed glasses.
But on weekends, White put on his football pads and starred for the
Detroit Lions, again leading the NFL in rushing.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, White crossed paths with Kennedy in the South
Pacific when, as a Navy intelligence officer, he was assigned to
write the official report on the sinking of Kennedy's PT 109.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, "Whizzer" White remained a celebrated figure, the
ideal of the scholar-athlete gone to war. He finished his legal
studies at Yale, clerked a year for Chief Justice Fred Vinson at the
Supreme Court and returned to Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Kennedy, who delved into politics and was elected to
Congress in 1946, White did not relish the spotlight. Shy and
reserved, he seemed to resent all the attention given his athletic
exploits. He had a special loathing for the sportswriters who dubbed
him "the Whizzer."</TE>
<TE>   His goals, he told a friend, were "to practice law, raise a family
and to keep my name out of the ... newspapers."</TE>
<TE>   By 1960, he was well on the way to achieving his aims. He had
married Marion Stearns, the daughter of the University of Colorado's
president, and they had two children, Charles and Nancy.</TE>
<TE>   As an attorney, White avoided the courtroom and immersed himself
in bankruptcy and tax cases that required concentration and long
preparation.</TE>
<TE>   He shunned politics, too, until Kennedy, by then a senator, asked
him to head his 1960 presidential campaign in Colorado. And after
Kennedy narrowly won the White House, he recruited his old friend to
run the Justice Department under his brother Robert.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks after the new deputy attorney general moved to
Washington, he went out for a lunch at a coffee shop near the Justice
Department.</TE>
<TE>   "Say, aren't you 'Whizzer' White?" a waitress asked.</TE>
<TE>   White looked up, a bit perturbed, and answered, "I was."</TE>
<TE>   Often in the years afterward, unwary well-wishers who were
introduced to White at receptions made the mistake of mentioning his
football career. Usually he glared, turned and walked away.</TE>
<TE>   But the Kennedys admired White as a model for the new
administration. He was smart and tough, a skeptic but one who was
committed to public service.</TE>
<TE>   In May 1961, the Kennedys sent him to Alabama with a contingent of
600 National Guardsmen to protect the "Freedom Riders," the young
civil-rights activists who were trying to integrate the interstate
bus system over the objection of Alabama's all-white power structure.
As a leader, White was calm, organized and definitely in charge.</TE>
<TE>   The next spring, Supreme Court Justice Charles Whittaker retired,
and the Kennedy brothers immediately focused on White to fill his
seat. They passed over a long list of Harvard academics and other
distinguished lawyers in favor of a rookie Justice Department
official with no judicial experience.</TE>
<TE>   White "was no mere professor or scholar, but had actually seen
life," President Kennedy explained. He has "excelled in everything he
has attempted," the president added.</TE>
<TE>   The new justice was less enthused by the nomination than was the
president.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a reluctant judge," said his biographer, University of
Chicago law professor Dennis J. Hutchison, a former White clerk. "And
many doubt it was the best use of his talents."</TE>
<TE>   A firm leader and a good organizer, White was well-suited to head
the FBI or a similar agency, he said. But "he didn't have much
patience with philosophies and abstractions," Hutchison said. "And he
was not a fluid writer."</TE>
<TE>   But White's nomination was widely praised, and he won a quick,
unanimous Senate confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few sour notes were heard. The New York Times editorialized
that White, then 44, did not have "the scholarly legal distinction"
that might be expected of someone destined for the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "The ideal justice should be ... a person of intellect and
compassion--and because the court must be a teacher--ability to
articulate," the paper said. These were not White's strengths.</TE>
<TE>   The new justice joined the Warren Court in April 1962 as it neared
the height of its liberal and activist period. It struck down
state-sponsored school prayers during his first term; a series of
subsequent rulings strengthened civil liberties and the rights of
criminal defendants.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Justice Earl Warren had a solid liberal majority in Justices
Hugo Black, William J. Brennan, William O. Douglas, and, later,
Justices Arthur Goldberg (Kennedy's second nominee) and Thurgood
Marshall.</TE>
<TE>   But White disagreed with many of the court's criminal law
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "In some unknown number of cases, the court's [Miranda] rule will
return a killer, a rapist or other criminal to the street ... to
repeat his crimes whenever he pleases," White wrote in an oft-quoted
dissent in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   The 1960s were a dark period for White because of the
assassinations of his two closest friends in politics.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 22, 1963, he walked the grounds of Robert Kennedy's
Hickory Hill mansion, his arm over the attorney general's shoulder,
just after receiving the news of the president's assassination in
Dallas. Five years later, Robert Kennedy was shot and killed in Los
Angeles, a loss that seemed to signal an end to a political era.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1970s, the court moved to the right, as four new
appointees of President Nixon took their seats. White found himself
at the center, the court's swing vote.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, he cast a reluctant fifth vote to strike down death
penalty laws as unconstitutional. Unlike the liberals, however, White
did not think that executions were cruel and unusual punishment.
Rather, he worried that the state laws were vague and did not set
clear guidelines on which killers should live and which should die.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later, he joined with a new majority to restore capital
punishment after several states, including California, enacted new
laws.</TE>
<TE>   Within the court, White was said to be a powerful and respected
figure, someone whose views could not be ignored. "If he disagreed
with you, you had to endure the frozen glare," one justice said.</TE>
<TE>   Even in his 70s, White retained powerful forearms and a crushing
grip, which he enjoyed exercising as the justices shook hands at the
beginning of their conferences.</TE>
<TE>   During oral arguments, he was combative. When he asked questions
of a lawyer, he insisted on a direct answer, not an explanation.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, your honor, we contend that ... ," one lawyer began his
reply.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes or no? What's your answer?" White snapped.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the court, White's influence was limited, however, because
his writings were bland and uninformative. His opinions, as more than
one commentator noted, seemed designed to convey as little as
possible.</TE>
<TE>   In his later years, he seemed more at home on the conservative
court led by Chief Justice Rehnquist. But even then, he sharply
dissented when the conservatives cut back on the powers of Congress
and bolstered states' rights. Until the end, he retained the basic
views of an early 1960s Democrat--a strong belief in federal power
and a commitment to civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   Though White left Colorado in 1961 and lived in the Washington
area for 40 years, he never lost touch with his home state.</TE>
<TE>   He returned annually for the judicial conference of the U.S. 10th
Circuit Court of Appeals and, after his retirement, worked part time
as a judge there. In 1994, Congress renamed the federal court
building in Denver in his honor. He returned to Colorado last year.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Marion; a son, Charles; and a
daughter, Nancy White Lippe.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements were pending.</TE>

<HD>Powell Visits Lebanon, Syria to Call for Peace</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Israel has vowed a fight if attacks on north go on.
Pullout is planned for two West Bank cities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DAMASCUS, Syria
</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell traveled to Damascus and Beirut
on Monday for talks aimed at averting a wider Middle East war, and the
United States explored the possibility of holding a conference to forge a
final peace among Israelis, Palestinians and moderate Arabs.</LD>
<LD>   Powell, on a high-stakes mission to defuse 18 days of heightened
hostilities since an Israeli offensive began in the West Bank, appeared
to run into initial setbacks on both fronts.</LD>
<LD>   In a move welcomed by the Bush administration, however, Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon said he plans to pull troops and tanks out of the
West Bank cities of Jenin and Nablus in a week or less.</LD>
<TE>   Sharon told President Bush about his plans when the American leader
called him from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, before a Republican fund-raiser. Bush
regarded Israel's move as positive, White House Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   "You're starting to see the results of the secretary's hard work," he
added.</TE>
<TE>   But Sharon said in an interview with CNN that Israel plans to remain
in the West Bank around the headquarters of Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat in Ramallah and at the Church of the Nativity in
Bethlehem until standoffs over wanted gunmen have been resolved.</TE>
<TE>   In Ramallah on Monday, Israel arrested Marwan Barghouti, the leader of
Arafat's Fatah faction and the man Israel holds responsible for dozens of
attacks. Sharon said Barghouti will be put on trial.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, witnesses in Tulkarm said Israeli tanks swept in from
several directions early today in what an Israeli military source
described as "a limited operation to arrest Palestinian militants," the
Reuters news agency reported.</TE>
<TE>   A delay in full withdrawal of Israeli forces could complicate Powell's
mission, since the U.S. is still searching for the key to breaking the
deadlock. As the secretary is finding at every stop, each issue he
addresses comes back to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Powell spent most of the day Monday calling on the leaders of Syria
and Lebanon to rein in Hezbollah and Palestinian extremists who have
launched almost daily attacks across the Lebanese border into Israel and
the Golan Heights, which was captured by Israel from Syria. The attacks
have coincided with the Israeli army's current operations against the
Palestinians in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has threatened a serious military response if the attacks do
not subside.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a very real danger of the situation along the border
widening the conflict in the region," Powell said in Beirut after talks
with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud. "It is essential for all those
committed to peace to act immediately to stop actions across the border."</TE>
<TE>   The United States asked Lebanon to increase military deployment in
southern areas. "If they could have an increased presence in the south,
that might serve as a deterring effect and give them more indications and
knowledge about what's going on in south Lebanon," Powell told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The secretary then called on Syria, which along with Iran has
significant influence over Hezbollah, to restrain the militia.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said he had "reasonable assurances" that Lebanon and Syria
recognize the potential repercussions from the attacks. And he noted that
Lebanon had arrested 24 Palestinians linked to attacks on civilian areas
in northern Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "Both said that they would do what they could do to restrain activity
of that type," Powell said. However, the secretary also faces strong
public opinion, long-standing government policies in the region and a
well-entrenched militia. At a news conference in Beirut, he acknowledged
that he faced "strong criticism."</TE>
<TE>   Lebanese Foreign Minister Mahmud Hammud charged that Israel is
responsible for the escalation in violence because it "blocked all
efforts seeking peace and rejected international resolutions that demand
its withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories."</TE>
<TE>   Lebanon also has a border dispute with Israel regarding the Golan's
Shabaa Farms, against which many of the Hezbollah attacks have been
launched. Lebanon considers Hezbollah's attacks the final resistance to
Israeli occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Hezbollah pledged to continue its campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "The American administration tries . . . to give the image of a
mediator in search of political solutions, when everyone knows it is a
partner in all the crimes and massacres that the Zionist enemy is
carrying out against the Palestinian people," it said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of Hezbollah supporters protested in the streets of Beirut.
As Powell's armored convoy sped through the Lebanese capital,
demonstrators who were held out of sight by police chanted, "We loathe
America. Powell, get out of here. The Palestinian people are being
exterminated by an American decision. America is the leader of terrorism
in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Syria's official news agency issued a statement blaming Israel for the
violence and saying it would be better to "eradicate the causes rather
than waste time condemning" attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Syrian President Bashar Assad does not have a great deal of
credibility with the Bush administration. During Powell's only other
visit to Syria about 14 months ago, Assad promised to curtail illegal oil
shipments by Iraq. Instead, they have continued, and U.S. officials say
that link now provides Baghdad with its largest source of illegal income.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be watching very closely to see if they're true to their word,"
said a senior State Department official traveling with Powell.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has already warned of the consequences if attacks do not end.</TE>
<TE>   "The leaders of these two countries have not taken our messages
seriously. We have made it clear that the current situation cannot
continue," Sharon told the Israeli parliament Sunday. Israel is still
capable of striking a "heavy blow," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell returned to Israel late Monday to try to bridge the wide gap
between Israel and the Palestinians. The secretary confirmed that the
administration is working on organizing a regional or international
conference of Israel and Arab nations.</TE>
<TE>   "The conference in and of itself isn't a solution, but it's a way to
get the parties together and talking," Powell told reporters en route
back to Israel. "Prime Minister Sharon gave some endorsement to that kind
of idea, and Chairman Arafat did as well."</TE>
<TE>   To get around Sharon's prohibiting Arafat from attending any
conference, Powell is probing the idea of holding a meeting at a lower
level.</TE>
<TE>   "It does not necessarily require his personal presence to get started,
and in fact one model one could consider is a ministerial-level
conference, not necessarily heads of state or government," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is considering venues in Europe, the Middle
East and the United States, and there is no firm list of possible
participants, U.S. officials said. The idea of a conference is just one
of several ideas being studied for seeking agreement on security and
reaching a political settlement.</TE>
<TE>   But both Lebanon and Syria insisted that Arafat should be included in
any conference on the future of a Palestinian state or an Israeli-Arab
peace. And Palestinian officials are already questioning the idea of
excluding him.</TE>
<TE>   Hassan Abdel Rahman, the Palestinian representative in Washington,
said no conference could take place until Israel ends its incursion into
the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Powell will hold more talks with Sharon today and with Arafat on
Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Israel Arrests the Leader of Arafat Faction</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Prime Minister Ariel Sharon lauds the capture of Fatah
chief Marwan Barghouti and vows a trial. Palestinians warn of
repercussions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israeli special forces arrested Marwan Barghouti, the leader of
Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction and the man Israel holds responsible for
dozens of deadly attacks on Israelis, in the West Bank city of Ramallah
on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Barghouti is the highest-ranking official arrested during Israel's
18-day military assault on Palestinian towns and villages. Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon, who has said the campaign is meant to crush Palestinian
militias, praised the arrest and said Barghouti will be put on trial.</LD>
<LD>   But West Bank security chief Jibril Rajoub warned that "killing or
humiliating [Barghouti] will bring catastrophes for Israel and will
expand the circle of violence."</LD>
<TE>   In a separate operation, Israeli troops arrested Jamal Tawil, head of
the military wing of Hamas, the militant Islamic organization, in
Beitunia, near Ramallah. Tawil reportedly was arrested in an apartment
hide-out and was taken to an undisclosed location.</TE>
<TE>   The pudgy, diminutive Barghouti is one of the few Palestinian leaders
who enjoy a mass following among young Palestinians. Long after he became
one of Israel's most wanted men, he remained a familiar figure at the
front of Palestinian funeral marches and public rallies. He traveled with
bodyguards but said he feared neither capture nor assassination by
Israeli forces. He was widely viewed among Palestinians as an
incorruptible figure.</TE>
<TE>   Israel accuses Barghouti, once regarded as a pragmatist who strongly
supported the Oslo peace accords, of leading the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade,
a militia linked to Fatah. Founded by Arafat, Fatah is the most powerful
Palestinian political movement.</TE>
<TE>   Barghouti denies that he is a militia leader but has repeatedly
praised attacks on Israelis, saying they are necessary to compel Israel's
withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the dismantling of
Jewish settlements in those areas.</TE>
<TE>   Right-wing Israeli lawmaker Michael Kleiner called for Barghouti to be
brought speedily to trial before a military court, where, Kleiner said,
he hoped Barghouti would receive the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   But Yossi Beilin, a dovish former justice minister for Israel, said
any prolonged detention of Barghouti, an elected member of the
Palestinian Legislative Council, "might push the conflict into a darker
alley."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian activist and legislator Hussam Khader, a leader of
militants in the West Bank city of Nablus who worked closely with
Barghouti, said his arrest is "a painful blow in the soft belly of the
intifada." Khader warned that putting Barghouti on trial in Israel would
"have dangerous repercussions."</TE>
<TE>   Barghouti, he said, "has a lot of power on the ground and is one of
the best-equipped people to bring back the trust of the Palestinian
people in peace and to bring back Palestinians to the negotiating table
in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Barghouti, 41, has sometimes clashed with Arafat but was also often at
the Palestinian Authority president's side and was sometimes mentioned as
a possible successor.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli security sources said Barghouti was captured in the home of
another Fatah activist, Ziad abu Ain, who was also arrested, along with
Barghouti's nephew and aide, Ahmed Barghouti. Marwan Barghouti reportedly
was taken to Jerusalem, where he was said to be under interrogation by
the General Security Service, or Shin Bet.</TE>
<TE>Implicated in Strikes by Militias</TE>
<TE>   "We said that this operation in the West Bank is to arrest the heads
of the terrorist organizations, to cut off the head of the snake," Raanan
Gissin, Sharon's spokesman, said in a telephone interview. "We are there
to dismantle these terrorist organizations. We have arrested a killer who
sent the Tanzim [militia] to kill Israelis."</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the army chief of staff, said Monday that Israel
has arrested 5,000 Palestinians since its forces swept into every major
Palestinian town except Jericho in an offensive launched March 29 after a
series of deadly suicide bombings inside Israel. Mofaz said 1,200 of
those arrested were militants who had participated in or planned attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Barghouti rose to prominence during the first Palestinian uprising
against Israeli military rule in the 1980s, as a student activist at
Birzeit University. He spent six years in Israeli jails and was
eventually deported. He learned to speak fluent Hebrew during his
incarceration and developed contacts with many Israeli peace activists
and politicians after he returned to the West Bank when Israel recognized
the Palestine Liberation Organization in the 1993 Oslo accords.</TE>
<TE>   For months after the second intifada erupted in September 2000, he was
regularly interviewed by Israeli media, saying he still supported the
establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.</TE>
<TE>Arrest Warrant Follows Attacks on Israelis</TE>
<TE>   Even as Israel's position toward the Palestinians hardened, Barghouti
said he believed that Palestinians were close to achieving their goal of
ending Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   But after Fatah-linked militias began carrying out shooting attacks on
Israeli soldiers and civilians, and later mounted suicide bombings,
Israel issued a warrant for Barghouti's arrest.</TE>
<TE>   He went underground when Israel launched its latest offensive, and the
army had been carrying out an intensive manhunt for him.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Barghouti surrendered without a shot fired. Israeli
security sources said that after tanks surrounded Ain's Ramallah home,
elite units that have often carried out assassinations of wanted
Palestinian militants arrived and called on Barghouti to come out. He
did, telling the soldiers in Hebrew that he wouldn't resist arrest. He
was driven away in an ambulance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good that he was arrested, in view of all that is happening,"
said Alon Liel, former director general of Israel's Foreign Ministry, in
an interview on Israel Radio. "But it's even better that he wasn't
assassinated, because Barghouti is fundamentally a man who believes in a
two-state solution, perhaps even in a fairer way than Arafat."</TE>
<TE>   Barghouti, Liel said, "wasn't able to live with the occupation,
against which he cruelly fought." The Palestinian activist "is one of the
people who, if there ever will be two states, will take care that the
Palestinian state will be friendly toward Israel."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Opens Probes Into HP Conduct in Deal Vote</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>Federal investigators have opened inquiries into reports that
Hewlett-Packard Co. may have improperly pressured Deutsche Bank and
Northern Trust Corp. to vote in favor of the computer maker's $19-billion
acquisition of Compaq Computer Corp., HP said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The probes renewed doubts that the largest technology merger in
history--pending the results of a shareholder vote last month--will be
consummated. Such federal probes are highly unusual in large corporate
mergers.</LD>
<LD>   "If in fact HP top management made a credible threat to Deutsche Bank
to withdraw business unless they voted HP's way, that would be a serious
breach of fiduciary duty," said Reinier Kraakman, professor of law at
Harvard University. "It's akin to stuffing ballot boxes."</LD>
<TE>   Just before the March 19 voting deadline, Palo Alto-based HP announced
a $4-billion line of credit that would be co-arranged by Deutsche Bank.
Then Deutsche Asset Management, the bank's investment unit, switched 17
million votes to favor the merger, according to a lawsuit filed to block
the deal.</TE>
<TE>   HP acknowledged receiving a subpoena April 10 from the U.S. attorney's
office for New York's Southern District demanding information about the
company's interactions with Deutsche Bank, Northern Trust and other
parties. Experts said a subpoena from the U.S. attorney's office points
to a criminal investigation by the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate civil action, the San Francisco office of the Securities
and Exchange Commission requested similar documents regarding Deutsche
Bank but has not alleged any legal violations, HP said.</TE>
<TE>   The company denied any improprieties but declined to comment further.
Representatives of the U.S. attorney and the SEC also declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, HP claimed victory in the merger vote by a razor-thin
margin; final results could be certified as early as this week.</TE>
<TE>   The federal actions may have been prompted by claims by dissident HP
director Walter Hewlett, who filed a lawsuit challenging the legality and
fairness of the merger vote. A representative for Hewlett declined to
comment on the federal investigations. A trial for that suit is to begin
April 23 in Delaware's Court of Chancery.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett, a major shareholder and son of late company co-founder
William Hewlett, claims that HP officers orchestrated improper efforts to
persuade large shareholders to support the merger plan.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations of impropriety gained steam last week when a voicemail
message from HP Chief Executive Carly Fiorina to Chief Financial Officer
Robert Wayman was surreptitiously forwarded to a San Jose Mercury News
reporter.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen a piece of [Northern Trust's] votes move against us, and
we're nervous," Fiorina said in the message. "We may have to do something
extraordinary for [Deutsche Bank and Northern Trust] to bring them over
the line."</TE>
<TE>   HP confirmed the message's authenticity and is investigating how the
company's voicemail system was apparently breached.</TE>
<TE>   Jesse Choper, a law professor at UC Berkeley, cautioned against
reading too much into Fiorina's voice message, noting: "There are all
kinds of lawful 'extraordinary' measures that could be taken."</TE>
<TE>   Other experts on corporate governance said that such investigations
are rare despite frequent allegations of impropriety.</TE>
<TE>   "There are reports of deal making and back scratching in any kind of
close campaign," said Nell Minow, co-founder and editor of the Corporate
Library, a shareholder watchdog group. "There has to be a gun, if not a
smoking gun," to justify an investigation, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Against the backdrop of continuing controversy, "the SEC had to do
something," said Paul McGuckin, research director for Gartner Inc., a
technology market researcher.</TE>
<TE>   "It can't look like it's sitting on its hands in case something ugly
comes out in the trial next week," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the federal investigations probably would focus
primarily on vote-buying issues.</TE>
<TE>   "[If] HP engaged in vote buying and the use of corporate resources to
compel Deutsche Bank to vote its way," said Harvard's Kraakman, "the
outcome would be overturned and require a new election."</TE>
<TE>   In investigations involving friendly takeovers, employees typically
don't cooperate happily. But substantial employee opposition to the
merger could create serious problems for HP, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Discovery and depositions [for the Hewlett suit] will uncover some
ugly things, because there are some disgruntled HP employees who will
want to talk," McGuckin said.</TE>
<TE>   Such investigations often take weeks or months. But in light of the
fast-moving developments in the merger controversy, federal authorities
may try to expedite the process. Experts also said HP's difficulties
reflect a new enforcement posture following the Enron Corp. scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very likely that something that would have been seen as
acceptable 12 months ago will not be seen as acceptable here," said Rob
Enderle, an analyst with Giga Information Group.</TE>
<TE>   But proving illegal manipulation of the merger vote may prove
difficult, experts said. The closeness of the contest suggests that
shareholders could have been convinced--and then changed their
minds--based on reasonable arguments by either side. Deutsche Bank and
Northern Trust could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>German Car Buyers' Favorite Pickup</HD>
<DH>Taking possession of a new vehicle is a ceremonial occasion in the
land of the Beetle and the BMW. Volkswagen has built an entire theme park
for the purpose.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WOLFSBURG, Germany
</DL>
<LD>Granted, climbing into a ride that replicates a rollover accident
is probably not every buyer's idea of what to do while waiting for a new
car to be delivered.</LD>
<LD>   But don't tell that to the people in line for the simulator, or the
kids buzzing around in the miniature Volkswagen Beetles, or the
technology buffs glued to the video display about fuel injection engines.</LD>
<LD>   Here, Germans' nationally revered act of going to the factory to pick
up a new car has been transformed into a deluxe celebration that can last
a day or weekend, a la an American trip to Disneyland.</LD>
<TE>   "For Germans, buying a new car is a big event," says Maria Schneider,
creative director of the VW Autostadt theme park, the second most popular
amusement park in the country. "The car is part of the family, like the
children."</TE>
<TE>   Traveling to the factory to receive the car rather than going to the
local dealership where it was ordered is a tradition here. Other major
manufacturers, such as DaimlerChrysler, BMW and Porsche, offer their
car-fetching visitors guided tours of their assembly plants and
one-on-one customer service at the time of collection.</TE>
<TE>   But VW has elevated a practical undertaking into a life experience. An
hour by train from Berlin and a pleasant five-minute walk from the
station is the $450-million Autostadt, German for Auto City. Amid a
Disney-like panoply of exhibits, rides and restaurants, Autostadt's 6,000
daily visitors each spend an average of 4 1/2 hours absorbing the latest
motor trends, strolling among man-made lakes and landscaped pavilions and
taking virtual-reality test drives.</TE>
<TE>   Though Autostadt is proving popular with VW buyers, the bulk of its
patrons are Germans simply out for a jaunt. From school field trips to
the annual office outings that are another unique national habit, the
theme park draws three times as many visitors on average as Berlin's
historic, glass-domed Reichstag.</TE>
<TE>   "We read about it when it opened but only got around to visiting now,"
said Cindy Woop, a 23-year-old tax advisor from Cologne who tried out the
rollover accident simulator, which demonstrates how seat belts and head
rests protect a driver. "It's interesting. It gets you thinking about
things you take for granted."</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece of the theme park is the car pickup center, a
cavernous hall combining the light and space of an airport terminal with
the atmosphere of a celebrity hangout. Car buyers are summoned to one of
three runways by an elevated futuristic signboard that flashes their
names, dealerships,license-plate numbers and collection appointments in
luminous lime-green letters. In a rare moment for Germans when the
customer is truly king, the buyer's entourage is then escorted down a
broad staircase to the collection level and encouraged to go over the
shiny new purchase with a fine-toothed comb.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, a uniformed delivery specialist with nearly three years'
training stands with an electronic clipboard, ready, able and willing to
answer any and all questions the buyers might have for as long as they
want to prolong the occasion.</TE>
<TE>   Delivery specialist Tatiana Vanella says that most customers'
questions are covered in the thick owner's manuals provided with each new
car but that many want a personal demonstration of how the
air-conditioning system works or tips on how to best protect the finish.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to know everything about the cars. That's why we train so
long," said Vanella, a Wolfsburg native who just graduated from the
post-sales school in January.</TE>
<TE>   Each proud new automotive parent spends an average of 70 minutes in
the delivery room, says Autostadt spokesman Nicholas Batten. By contrast,
it is rare in Germany for soon-to-be fathers to spend any time at all in
the room while their wives are delivering babies.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent day, retired machinist Wolfgang Lechner stepped up to the
receiving stage to take possession of his poppy-red Golf diesel. He and
son Stefan had spent a few hours puttering around the antique car museum
and new technology exhibits before their appointment with delivery
specialist Enrico Behrens.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'll be happier with this hatchback now that I'm retired,"
said the elder Lechner while his son poked under the hood as they got
ready for the five-hour drive home to Kempten. "I had a BMW sedan until
now, but it's getting to be too much of a struggle to get a case of beer
into the trunk. With this car, I can slide it in and out more easily."</TE>
<TE>   Dirk and Monika Pilarski, collecting their Golf station wagon on the
same day, lauded the attention lavished on 6-year-old son Simon, who even
after five hours was protesting his parents' entreaties that they head
home.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot for kids to do with their hands and a lot of stuff that
gives them a sense of being a grown-up," Monika said. "The whole
child-care center is designed to keep the kids busy so the adults can
enjoy and inform themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Miniature electric-powered Beetles allow children as young as 5 to
motor around an outdoor test track after a 15-minute instruction film and
"exam" on the rules of the road. Successful passage of the easy test on
stop signs and seat belts qualifies a child for an official-looking
driver's license complete with photo that is good on the electric-car
grounds of the Autostadt. Child-care professionals look after youngsters
up to 3, and a center well-appointed with things on wheels takes care of
those older but still too young for the road test.</TE>
<TE>   With such amenities, the nearly 2-year-old Autostadt is drawing at
least twice as many visitors daily as marketing gurus envisioned when
they came up with the idea seven years ago. Admission is free for the
roughly 500 buyers who arrive each day to claim their cars. It is also
free for as many family members and friends as they have in tow, but
other visitors must pay the equivalent of about $8 for an adult and $5
for a child. That has made the theme park, which employs 1,800 people,
far less of a drain on the company's marketing budget than designers
expected. Autostadt generates enough income to finance continuous
refinement and expansion, Schneider says.</TE>
<TE>   While infatuation with cars is widely regarded as a guy
thing,Autostadt's administrators say the park's primary target is women.</TE>
<TE>   "In German families, it's the women who make the choices about what
kind of car to buy, what color it should be, how much trunk space is
needed," says corporate communications officer Silke Schumacher. "It's
usually the wife who does the most driving, so she has the most influence
in the decision."</TE>
<TE>   Going to the factory to get the car seems to be a peculiarly German
practice, an ingrained consequence of consumers' fixation on authenticity
and elaborate preparation, Autostadt chief executive Otto Wachs says.</TE>
<TE>   "Europeans in general and Germans in particular are more focused on
the process of buying a car than are Americans," Wachs says. "They think
for a long time about what they want in a car, draw up a list of the
options they will order and often wait months for their car to be
completed. They don't go to a dealership and say, 'Hey, this yellow one
appeals to me' and have it home in the garage two hours later."</TE>
<TE>   Decision-to-delivery does take an amount of time that U.S. consumers
would probably find unacceptable. But anticipation is part of the
attraction here. Most of those collecting their cars in early April
ordered them before Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want it any earlier. I wanted to come during the Easter
break so the kids could come along," said Werner Seidel, a divorced
father from Bavaria who was Autostadt's 4-millionth visitor. Feted with
cake and champagne and photographed for local media and company
promotions, Seidel shared the limelight with his father, Edi, 9-year-old
daughter, Lisa, and 12-year-old son, Jochen.</TE>
<TE>   While Autostadt's administrators estimate that they probably sell
about 1% of their daily visitors on the idea of eventually owning a VW or
sister product from Audi, Skoda, Seat, Bentley or Lamborghini, it is not
possible to buy a car at the theme park. Wachs says the Autostadt
experience should enhance the brand image of Europe's No. 1 car maker
rather than undermine the time-tested relationship between local dealers
and consumers.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, an Autostadt visit to get the car is one of the incentives a
dealer can offer to a prospective buyer. Reduced rates at the on-site
Ritz-Carlton Hotel and its Michelin-starred restaurant are available, as
well as the opportunity to avoid more than $400 in delivery taxes. Such
benefits make it cost-effective to make the pickup in person.</TE>
<TE>   Getting the car is a ritual that begins with the buyer's taking
license plates acquired from local authorities to a reception office
above the piazza where post-sales personnel set in motion the hand-over
that can run the whole day if a customer so desires. The names of all
members of the collection party are radioed to VW colleagues at each stop
on the pickup itinerary, and the precise, long-agreed-upon time for the
ceremonial hand-over is confirmed. While the buyer's party is perusing
the exhibits, simulators, games and gastronomic offerings, the relevant
car--earlier shuttled from the adjacent factory to the theme park's twin
20-story storage towers--is moved to the delivery room of the pickup
center for final polishing, plate attachment and inspection.</TE>
<TE>   Collecting a car at the factory is a practice currently limited to
German buyers because of European Union tax and customs rules, but
changes within the economic bloc will make it possible for Austrians to
take part in the Wolfsburg experience by summer. For potential buyers
from outside the EU--say, an American wanting a car at the start of a
European trip--a hand-over can be arranged with sufficient notice, says
Batten, the Autostadt spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Departing customers get two route maps for their outbound journey--one
the most direct, the other taking in scenery and attractions--along with
little extras like windshield scrapers and dashboard sun shields. Any
purchases from the Autostadt's three car-equipment shops, which sell
everything from floor mats to picnic baskets, are loaded into the trunk
along with luggage checked at the train station, so the new car owner can
drive home without stopping.</TE>
<TE>   What happens if the buyer fails to show up during the mere handful of
minutes his or her name is flashed on the signboard?</TE>
<TE>   "Germans don't miss their appointed times," replied Batten, clearly
shocked by the suggestion. "On the rare occasion when people get delayed
by the unexpected, they call ahead to warn us. This is something they
take very seriously."</TE>

<HD>Parent's Fate Tied to Life-or-Death Decision for Son</HD>
<DH>Ethics: Father who could face homicide charge won't let doctors
turn off baby's life support.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His eyes wide open but empty, baby Christopher lies in a
stainless-steel crib, plastic tubes twisting from bedside machines into
holes in his throat and belly.</LD>
<LD>   On some days, his body twitches slightly. But for the most part, ever
since being rushed to the hospital one week before Christmas, Christopher
has lain motionless under rows of fluorescent lights, relying on machines
to feed him and fill his tiny lungs with oxygen.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors say the 7 1/2-month-old has suffered a devastating brain
injury and will not recover. His mother wants to turn off the machines
that keep Christopher alive and end what she considers his torture.</LD>
<TE>   But Christopher's father has withheld his approval for almost four
months. He's voicing his objections from a cell at the Orange County
Jail, where he stands accused of felony child abuse for allegedly shaking
Christopher and throwing him into his crib.</TE>
<TE>   The father's attorney said he's hoping for a "miracle." But both
Christopher's mother and authorities note that if Christopher dies, his
father's charges would be upgraded from assault to homicide.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's up to the system to determine Christopher's fate, balancing a
parent's right to keep his child alive with the self-interest that might
motivate that decision.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County social workers have taken temporary custody of the baby,
arguing that neither parent is fit to care for him.</TE>
<TE>   Watching out for the baby's interests falls to an attorney appointed
by a judge to represent him in family court. Harold LaFlamme struggles
with the question. Each outcome, he says, is fraught with problems.</TE>
<TE>   "If some third party makes a decision to turn off the juice, then are
you giving the defendant parent a defense, 'I didn't kill the kid, the
child's attorney did,' " he said. "As a general proposition, the juvenile
courts prefer to let the parents make the decision. But that doesn't seem
to be happening here."</TE>
<TE>   Christopher was an underdog from the beginning, the son of a young,
impoverished couple. His mother, Tamara Sepulveda, suffered a childhood
brain injury that has slowed her speech and thought process, according to
a report prepared by the county's Social Services Agency in the wake of
Christopher's injury.</TE>
<TE>   His father, Moises Ibarra, has a temper, the report states, that led
him to shake the child out of frustration many times before Christopher
suffered the paralyzing injury.</TE>
<TE>   Ibarra and Sepulveda, both 23, met a few years ago while living on
boats in a gritty marina beneath the Terminal Island Freeway near the
Port of Los Angeles. The young couple had a volatile relationship,
breaking up after loud arguments only to get back together, again and
again.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher was born Sept. 2 as Sepulveda sat on a toilet in the
couple's apartment, according to the Social Services report. The new
addition to the family caused the couple's arguments to intensify. Often,
the subject of their squabbling was the rough way Sepulveda thought
Ibarra was treating their son, she said.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 17, their roommate heard another argument from behind the
couple's closed bedroom door. There was screaming, then a loud thud, said
the roommate, Michael Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   Ibarra emerged from the bedroom of their Cypress apartment with a look
of panic on his face, their roommate recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "Help!" he said. "My baby's not breathing."</TE>
<TE>   Christopher lay limp in Ibarra's arms. His skin had turned purple.</TE>
<TE>   The parents gave conflicting accounts about what happened to their
baby, according to the report by social workers. At first, Sepulveda told
authorities that she went to change Christopher's diaper that night and
found he was not breathing. Later, she changed her story, insisting that
she watched her boyfriend shake the baby and then throw his body into the
crib, causing his head to snap back.</TE>
<TE>   Paramedics rushed the infant to La Palma Inter-Community Hospital in
critical condition. A few days later, after the baby was moved to
Children's Hospital of Orange County, a social worker and doctor called
Sepulveda and her mother, Susan, into a small conference room for a
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher will need to be on a life-support system for the rest of
his life, Sepulveda recalls the doctor telling her. He'll never hug you,
never speak to you, the doctor told her.</TE>
<TE>   The Social Services Agency report later described the baby as
"neurologically devastated," unable to breathe on his own or respond to
pain. The report quoted a doctor as saying: "The only thing he is doing
is gasping, otherwise we would have pronounced him brain dead."</TE>
<TE>   After hearing the grim prognosis, Sepulveda didn't take long to make
her decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I want him to go to heaven," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The social worker said she'd need Ibarra's permission. But by this
time, Cypress police had already taken the father to the Orange County
Jail. A few days later, the social worker called to say that Ibarra
wouldn't allow them to disconnect the machines.</TE>
<TE>   And without the father's approval, the child would stay on life
support.</TE>
<TE>   Ibarra, held on $250,000 bail, said through his attorney that the only
reason he's refusing to cut off life support is his love for his son.
Ibarra's lawyer maintains that doctors were initially more optimistic
about Christopher's chances for survival and that his client still has
faith that the baby can pull through.</TE>
<TE>   "I am holding out hope for a miracle, as is my client," said Assistant
Public Defender David Dworakowski. "Mr. Ibarra is presumed innocent of
these charges and is obviously devastated by the events, as any loving
father would be."</TE>
<TE>   Ibarra's trial on child abuse charges will likely go to trial later
this year. California law would allow prosecutors to charge Ibarra with
murder if his son dies, even if he's already been convicted of child
abuse. Cypress police Sgt. Gordon Re said his department would recommend
murder charges if Christopher dies.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts and medical ethicists described Christopher's case as
highly unusual, and one in which the law offers no easy answers. Although
courts usually leave decisions about a child's medical options in the
hands of parents, this might not be wise when a parent has a vested
interest in the outcome, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, the decision should not be in the hands of a parent who has
so much to gain or lose by the decision," said Gerald Uelmen, a professor
at Santa Clara University's law school.</TE>
<TE>   David Blake, vice president of mission and ethics at St. John's Health
Center in Santa Monica, said normal medical protocols also break down in
such an unusual case because the motivation of the parent is in question.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said they know of few cases similar to Christopher's. Six
years ago, a New York doctor fought a hospital's attempts to turn off
life support for the infant daughter he was accused of violently shaking.
A judge granted the hospital's request to disconnect life-support
systems, but the girl instead was transferred to a Catholic hospital at
the request of Cardinal John O'Connor. The child later died, and the
doctor was convicted of manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   At least temporarily, both of Christopher's parents have lost their
right to decide his fate. Orange County's Child and Family Services
division received permission from a judge to take Christopher into
temporary protective custody while it sorts out the issues and
allegations. Social workers faulted Sepulveda for not doing more to
protect Christopher from abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The court also appointed attorney LaFlamme to represent Christopher's
interests in court. LaFlamme said he plans to seek multiple medical
opinions on the baby's condition, but he remains unsure about how long
Christopher's fate will remain in limbo.</TE>
<TE>   In most instances, California physicians will remove life support only
with the consent of a child's parents or legal guardian.</TE>
<TE>   "Am I doing him service by keeping him alive? . . . I don't know
[yet]," LaFlamme said. "If the medical community says this is cruel to
keep him alive, then I might have to make some choices."</TE>
<TE>   Sepulveda, meanwhile, plans to file a petition with the court to turn
off Christopher's life-support system--a move LaFlamme said he may well
support if he concludes the baby will never recover. "It's really a
parent's decision," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher's crib is decorated with many of the toys that used to
adorn the crib at his family's apartment in Cypress. There is a stuffed
Mickey Mouse doll in one corner and a music box that plays the nursery
rhyme "Itsy Bitsy Spider" in another.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher lay on his back during a recent afternoon at the hospital.
The only time his body moved was when his chest expanded with air from a
breathing machine. Sepulveda rubbed her son's knee gently and said,
"Mama's here. It's OK."</TE>
<TE>   She passed a hand over his eyes, but they didn't move. Instead, they
remained wide open, his brown pupils shifted to the left, dead still for
20 minutes. Before she left, Sepulveda told her son what she hopes
happens to him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time to go to heaven," she said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Cardinals Are Called to Vatican</HD>
<DH>Catholics: The pope summons all eight for a meeting on the growing
sexual-abuse scandal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II on Monday summoned all eight U.S. cardinals to
Rome next week for an unprecedented closed-door meeting on the burgeoning
sexual-abuse scandal in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Experts were stunned by the announcement because the pope has never
called cardinals on such short notice to confer on a single controversy.
Only days ago, the Vatican strongly indicated that the pope intended to
leave the crisis in the hands of American bishops.</LD>
<LD>   Some U.S. Vatican watchers said they hoped the news meant John Paul is
finally realizing the gravity of the scandal. Four weeks ago, the pope
declared that guilty priests had succumbed to "the most grievous forms"
of evil, but offered no suggestions on practical ways to address the
problem.</LD>
<TE>   Church insiders said the pope's intentions could range from repeating
his support of the American church in a time of crisis to asking hard
questions about how the United States' 195 Catholic dioceses plan to
solve the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, archbishop of the nation's
largest Catholic archdiocese, said that he expects the Vatican
discussions to be "open, frank and without limitations." They will
probably be held April 23 and 24.</TE>
<TE>   Just Saturday, Bishop Wilton D. Gregory, president of the U.S.
Conference of Catholic Bishops, emerged from meetings in Rome to say the
pope "at this point" was relying on American bishops, who have total
authority of individual dioceses, to handle the crisis. Gregory said the
pope expressed "fraternal solidarity" with U.S. bishops and had been
"deeply touched" by the suffering and scandal. But there was no hint of a
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, someone over there has decided that maybe they check into
this a little bit further," said Father Richard P. McBrien, a Catholic
commentator and theology professor at the University of Notre Dame, who
has been critical of how the scandal has been handled by the Vatican and
U.S. bishops.</TE>
<TE>   Sister Jeannine Gramick, a reform-minded nun who was silenced by the
Vatican for soft-pedaling church teachings on homosexuality, said Monday
it was "extraordinary" that the Vatican would respond to an issue that
has been kept alive by the "grass-roots church."</TE>
<TE>   "I have great hope that this will be reform for the church," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But McBrien and others cautioned against expecting any concrete policy
changes to emerge from the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal has precipitated a crisis of confidence among
rank-and-file Catholics, calls for the resignations of the
cardinal-archbishops of Boston and New York, the firing of scores of
priests and the resignation of a Florida bishop.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal mushroomed from media revelations in January that Cardinal
Bernard Law of Boston had knowingly transferred priests with histories of
molesting youths from parish to parish.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, attorneys said 450 more people have come forward claiming
they were sexually abused by Boston-area priests. These are in addition
to 86 victims of one former Boston priest, John Geoghan, who reached an
out-of-court settlement with the Boston diocese last month.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. bishops, who will meet in Dallas this June, are hammering out new
initiatives behind the scenes to further address a problem that has
dogged them for several decades.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory, bishop of Belleville, Ill., said he hoped the Dallas meeting
will agree on a common protocol to be followed by all dioceses on how to
prevent and deal with sex-abuse allegations. The bishops' conference has
no authority to impose such a policy, however, and sexual-abuse
prevention policies differ from diocese to diocese.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony is thought to be carving out a role for himself on the national
scene by calling for more direct involvement by members of the laity in
diocesan polices. Among those on his sexual-abuse advisory committee are
the parents of two boys who were molested. A retired judge also sits on
the panel.</TE>
<TE>   "I welcome an expanded role in our wonderful Catholic laity in dealing
with these issues now and in the future," Mahony said Monday. Such a step
was seen as a response to criticisms that the church has been secretive
in dealing with the sexual-abuse scandal and that bishops were not
accountable for their actions to anyone except the pope.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony recently told The Times that he intends to ask bishops in
Dallas why some failed to act earlier, even though he has recently come
under criticism himself for failing to inform Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
that a Catholic chaplain assigned there had been accused of sexually
molesting a minor.</TE>
<TE>   McBrien, who had called for the resignation of Boston's Cardinal Law,
said Monday that Law and Cardinal Edward M. Egan of New York should
excuse themselves from the Vatican talks.</TE>
<TE>   "They're targets of investigations. They've been accused themselves of
serious malfeasance in office in this matter," McBrien said.</TE>
<TE>   He added, "The best one can expect, even with this particular group of
people, is that the Vatican officials may get the idea that this crisis
is bigger than they thought.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just a symptom of American permissiveness," McBrien said.
"It's not just a few bad apples. It's not just a media-generated crisis.
It isn't something that liberal Catholics have hijacked to press their
own agenda. If out of this meeting they come away with the idea that this
is not something they can ride out, that will be a positive outcome."</TE>
<TE>   Cardinals called to Rome are Mahony, Law, Egan, Anthony Bevilacqua of
Philadelphia, Francis George of Chicago, William Keeler of Baltimore,
Theodore E. McCarrick of Washington and Adam Maida of Detroit. It was not
clear whether retired cardinals or those assigned to the Vatican would
participate. Gregory and bishops conference vice president William
Skylstad of Spokane will attend.</TE>

<HD>FDA Smooths the Way for the Cosmetic Use of Botox</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, catching up with Americans'
quest for youthful beauty, approved the use of Botox on Monday to reduce
the appearance of wrinkles.</LD>
<LD>   Last year alone, more than 855,000 people received injections of
botulinum toxin type A, as Botox is formally known, to smooth out frown
lines, forehead creases, crow's feet and neck bands. Many patients also
get refresher injections when the effects of the original shot wear off
after three to six months.</LD>
<LD>   Plastic surgeons hailed the FDA's approval of Botox for cosmetic use,
saying it would give doctors and patients more confidence.</LD>
<TE>   The approval "provides reassurance to both patients and physicians
that it's an OK product in terms of safety and efficacy," said Dr. James
Wells, a Long Beach plastic surgeon and president-elect of the American
Society of Plastic Surgeons.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Glynis Ablon, a dermatologist and cosmetic surgeon in Manhattan
Beach, said that thousands of Californians are already lining up for
Botox injections to smooth wrinkles.</TE>
<TE>   "Actors, actresses, housewives, husbands, lawyers: people from age 20
all the way up to age 80," she said. She expects the FDA action to create
a wave of advertising and price wars--perhaps knocking hundreds of
dollars off the $350 to $700 price tag for a round of injections--and
launch the procedure into the mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA first approved Botox, a byproduct of the bacteria that causes
botulism, in 1989 for the treatment of two eye-muscle disorders. In 2000,
it said the toxin could also be used to treat a disorder that causes neck
and shoulder spasms.</TE>
<TE>   But because federal law allows physicians to use approved drugs for
unapproved purposes "as they deem appropriate," doctors a few years ago
began injecting Botox into facial muscles to reduce or eliminate
wrinkles. "We don't regulate the practice of medicine," said FDA
spokesman Jason Brodsky.</TE>
<TE>Maker Celebrates Potential Windfall</TE>
<TE>   For officials at Irvine-based manufacturer Allergan, which asked the
FDA early last year to authorize Botox for cosmetic use, Monday's
approval launched celebrations of an anticipated windfall.</TE>
<TE>   "We're thrilled," said Christine Cassiano, Allergan's manager of
public affairs. Allergan's stock rose $3.80 to $65.71 in Monday's
trading.</TE>
<TE>   Botox generated 18% of the company's sales revenue last year, about
$310 million, and with the new FDA approval sales this year could total
$385 million to $420 million, Cassiano said. The company will spend about
$50 million this year to tout the line-erasing properties of the product,
which it has renamed Botox Cosmetic, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials say the drug is particularly effective at
temporarily getting rid of the vertical lines that can develop between
the eyebrows.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have that '11' between my eyes anymore," said Patricia
Reimerdes, a 50-year-old New York mother of two who got a Botox injection
in February. "I love it."</TE>
<TE>   Reimerdes conceded that the injection has also left her unable to
raise her eyebrows.</TE>
<TE>   "But that's OK," she said, adding that she will "definitely" have the
procedure done again when the effects of her first injection fade away.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the creation of an expressionless, zombie-like face is among
the treatment's more notorious side effects, which also include
headaches, respiratory infection, droopy eyelids and nausea, according to
the FDA.</TE>
<TE>   "I tend to like facial expression, myself," said Wells, the plastic
surgeon in Long Beach, but Botox does "soften the aging process."</TE>
<TE>   Among the other surreal Botox effects Wells has seen or read about are
a permanent quizzical look and an equally fixed "witch-like" look. Then
there was one of his own patients, Wells recalled, who had trouble
pursing her lips around a straw after he injected too much Botox in the
lines around her mouth.</TE>
<TE>The Lure of Botox's 'Quick Fix' Cited</TE>
<TE>   Despite the risks, Wells believes the convenience and "quick fix"
aspect of Botox injections will make the treatment increasingly popular
among baby boomers who are beginning to despair as they see the lines in
the mirror.</TE>
<TE>   Botox injections can be administered in five minutes to 15 minutes per
wrinkle area, and the benefits are evident in a couple of days, Wells
said.</TE>
<TE>   And for many people seeking to erase the marks of time, a Botox
injection, which averages $400 per area, is far more affordable than a
face-lift, which would set them back thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>Injections Popular Among 35-Plus Crowd</TE>
<TE>   According to a survey commissioned by the American Society of Plastic
Surgeons, 55% of the 855,846 people who received Botox injections last
year were ages 35 to 50.</TE>
<TE>   Botox injections accounted for 15% of all nonsurgical cosmetic
procedures performed last year. Other popular cosmetic treatments or
plastic surgeries include chemical peels, liposuction, eyelid surgery,
face-lifts and breast augmentation.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, ever ahead of the curve on facial-line
elimination, doctors say the cosmetically enhanced have already moved on
to the next big Botox thing: underarm injections of the drug to stop
perspiration--for a while.</TE>

<HD>Failure to Decry Coup Attempt Puts the U.S. in an Awkward Spot</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Washington stands out for not denouncing the ouster of
the Venezuelan leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration scrambled Monday to explain why it failed
to denounce the coup that briefly swept Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
from office last week, an attempt that Latin American leaders decried as
an attack on a democratically elected leader.</LD>
<LD>   While others in the region were urging Chavez's restoration to power,
the White House initially blamed the coup attempt on the president's own
actions. Only on Sunday, when Chavez was poised to regain his authority,
did the United States join other members of the Organization of American
States in a vaguely worded resolution that condemned the "alteration of
constitutional order in Venezuela."</LD>
<LD>   A populist strongman with Marxist leanings, Chavez has alienated most
of the primary institutions in his country and has few allies in the
Western Hemisphere. But he was legitimately elected, and some Latin
American diplomats and other experts said the United States--which has
led international efforts to deter the overthrow of democratic
governments--could be hurt by its failure to condemn the abortive coup.</LD>
<TE>   One Latin American diplomat in Washington said the U.S. reaction "has
been noted" and could upset leaders in countries that might be threatened
by coups.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Coppedge, a Latin America specialist at Notre Dame University,
said the differences in the U.S. and Latin American reactions to the
attempted coup had left the United States isolated and in a "very
difficult position." Some people in the hemisphere may view the United
States as hypocritical, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. was a principal advocate of the Inter-American Democratic
Charter adopted in September, which calls for sanctions against
governments that take power by unlawful force. Federal law requires the
U.S. to impose sanctions on such governments.</TE>
<TE>   After months of unrest, it appeared Friday that a group of business
and military leaders had ousted Chavez. But by Sunday, after troop
mutinies and street fighting, he had been reinstated as the head of
Venezuela's government.</TE>
<TE>   State Department spokesman Philip T. Reeker said U.S. officials had
limited their comments Friday because it was unclear what had happened in
Venezuela and who was in charge. "I think it's a matter of knowing what
the facts are, seeing how things develop and exactly what is going on
there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Reeker said the United States was trying to work with other countries
in the hemisphere on the crisis and looked forward to seeing the results
of an OAS mission to Venezuela that will seek to explain the events of
the last week.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials continued to refrain from welcoming the return of
Chavez, and they made it clear that they believed the Chavez government
needs to launch a number of reforms to be considered fully democratic.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said they were unhappy that the Chavez government had
sought to control the news media, to limit independent political
activities and to impose political changes unilaterally.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has also made known its unhappiness with Chavez's
government on a number of other issues. Venezuela allegedly supports
Colombian rebel groups that the U.S. considers terrorists and drug
traffickers and has sought closer ties to Iraq, Libya and Cuban leader
Fidel Castro.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez has also sought to limit his country's oil production in a way
that would increase prices in the United States. Venezuela is one of the
top suppliers of oil to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials also argue that it remains unclear who will end up in
charge as the unrest continues.</TE>
<TE>   "Venezuela remains a somewhat fluid situation still," said Ari
Fleischer, the White House press secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said it was not clear that the Chavez regime could punish the
United States for its lack of support. Venezuela needs to sell oil, and
it would be disruptive for it to find other customers. Oil is the
government's most important export.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. was not alone in its awkward posture on Chavez. In Britain,
Dennis McShane, the foreign office minister responsible for Latin
America, Saturday described Chavez as a "ranting, populist demagogue" and
compared him to Italian dictator Benito Mussolini.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, McShane took a more subdued approach. "Last week's coup has
failed. Any change of government in Venezuela, as elsewhere in Latin
America and the world, should come about by democratic means," he said in
a statement.</TE>

<HD>Chavez Replaces Key Military Leaders</HD>
<DH>S. America: President says he is unlikely to arrest all coup
supporters. Opposition groups vow to keep pressing for reforms.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela
</DL>
<LD>President Hugo Chavez replaced key generals and held at least five
top military leaders--including the head of the army--in custody Monday
as new details emerged about the rifts in the armed forces that led a
group of officers to rise up and then quickly scramble to put Chavez back
in power.</LD>
<LD>   Opposition leaders promised to keep pressure on Chavez and renewed
their calls for democratic reform in Venezuela, saying the economic and
political crisis that precipitated last week's failed uprising had not
disappeared.</LD>
<LD>   "We call on this government to abandon its authoritarian and
totalitarian positions," said Manuel Cova, secretary-general of the
Confederation of Venezuelan Workers, which called the general strike last
week that led to the president's brief ouster. "Our struggle has not
ended."</LD>
<TE>   When Chavez took a series of steps Thursday to stop the opposition
movement, leaders of the armed forces tried to force him out of office.
They backed a civilian-led "transitional government" that lasted just 28
hours, collapsing in the face of pro-Chavez protests, rioting and a
military counter-rebellion.</TE>
<TE>   The streets of Caracas were calm Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In a four-hour news conference with foreign reporters, Chavez said he
had identified dozens of officers linked to the uprising but not all of
them would be investigated.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these officers have called me," Chavez said. "A lot of them
were on one side, then jumped on the other, back and forth." Chavez said
that these officers had appeared in television news conferences in which
he was denounced but that "they didn't say anything . . . they just stood
there. . . . They were manipulated."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say that a full-scale purge of insurgent officers is unlikely
and that serious rifts still exist within the armed forces.</TE>
<TE>   "If he starts a purge, it could cause another revolt," said Luis
Vicente Leon, who runs a polling and political analysis firm here.</TE>
<TE>   Leon said the rebellion showed the depth of anger among many officers
with Chavez's rule, which grew increasingly heavy-handed in recent months
as he lost popularity in the face of an economic crisis. "This story
isn't finished yet," Leon said. "It's just the first round."</TE>
<TE>   The military rebellion against Chavez had been brewing for several
months and centered on an organization of officers known as Dignity and
Integrity for the Armed Forces, said the Caracas daily newspaper El
Nacional. Only a few of those officers have come under fire since Chavez
returned to power.</TE>
<TE>   El Nacional reported that the rebellion collapsed when it became clear
that some mid-level troop commanders remained loyal to Chavez. In the
central city of Maracay, an air force unit declared itself for Chavez and
prepared to defend its base against attack.</TE>
<TE>   Higher-ranking officers who opposed Chavez abandoned the revolt in
part because of the international outcry at the measures taken by their
civilian allies, which included the dismissal of the national
legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than break a strong taboo on opening fire against other
soldiers, the dissenting officers preferred to release Chavez, possibly
striking a deal with him for leniency. Chavez went from prisoner back to
president, flying back to Caracas from the island military base where he
was being held.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Defense Minister Jose Vicente Rangel said Gen. Efrain
Vasquez topped the list of those officers in custody. Vasquez had been
the head of the army, and Chavez said Monday that he was one of the
leaders of the conspiracy against him. Two other army generals and two
admirals were also in custody.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez announced the appointment of a new head of the army, a new
inspector general of the armed forces, and a new head of the military
academy, among other positions.</TE>
<TE>   But Chavez said he was unlikely to arrest more officers, in part
because of the memory of what happened when he led a failed coup in 1992.
"There were some 300 of us in jail," Chavez recalled. "That didn't sit
very well."</TE>
<TE>   The president promised to "err on the side of humanism, respect and
human rights" in dealing with the leaders of the uprising. He had words
of compassion, too, for deposed interim president and business leader
Pedro Carmona, one of the few civilians in custody.</TE>
<TE>   "He made a serious mistake, but he was manipulated," Chavez said. The
uprising's leaders "put it in his head that he was going to be president.
. . . I feel sorry for him." Monday evening, Carmona was allowed to go
home under house arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez said he would soon begin a "national dialogue," including
round-table discussions with civic leaders. He said he had been inspired
to do so during his imprisonment.</TE>
<TE>   "To my adversaries I say, 'Continue being my adversaries,' " Chavez
said. "But also ask them not to hate me. I don't hate anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Opposition figures said Monday that they appreciated Chavez's
conciliatory tone but that they would continue to press for reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "The crisis that brought forth that multitude onto the streets of
Caracas has not subsided," said Antonio Ledezma of Bravo Pueblo Alliance,
an opposition group.</TE>
<TE>   Many opposition figures have accused Chavez and his supporters of
firing on the anti-Chavez crowd that marched on the presidential palace
Thursday. At least 15 people were killed that day. In all, about 60
people died in four days of violence.</TE>

<HD>Moscow OKs U.S. Poultry</HD>
<DH>Imports: Products from four states and 14 companies remain banned
because of diseases, Russia says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>Russia partially lifted a ban on U.S.-produced poultry Monday,
formally ending a nasty trade dispute that has clouded relations in
advance of a presidential summit next month.</LD>
<LD>   But the Agriculture Ministry said poultry from four states and 14
producers, about 25% of pre-embargo imports, will still be excluded,
making it unlikely that the largest U.S. export to Russia will fully
rebound in the near future.</LD>
<LD>   "It may take some time to get back to where we were, if we ever do,"
Toby Moore, president of the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council, said by
telephone from his office in Georgia. "The image of U.S. poultry has been
harmed deeply."</LD>
<TE>   Russia announced the ban on U.S.-produced chicken and turkey in early
March, on the heels of the Bush administration's imposition of heavy
tariffs on imported steel from Russia and other countries.</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials deny that the chicken ban was imposed as
retaliation. They have complained that American poultry violates Russian
standards for hygiene and additives, including antibiotics.</TE>
<TE>   On March 31, Russian and U.S. negotiators reached agreement on new
standards for U.S. poultry. The United States says that in the last two
weeks, it has made changes in testing and documentation to comply with
the new standards, leading to the Russian announcement Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Poultry from the four excluded states--North Carolina, Virginia,
Pennsylvania and Maine--has still been found to be infected with "avian
influenza," Russia's Agriculture Ministry said. Poultry from the 14
excluded companies has been found to contain salmonella, it said. It did
not release a list of the companies.</TE>
<TE>   "The Agriculture Ministry notes that at the present time, there are
effectively two separate standards of veterinary control in the United
States. One, which requires strict adherence to all medical norms and
necessary standards, is used for the internal U.S. market. The other,
extremely liberal with only half-hearted enforcement, is applied to
exports, including those intended for Russia," the ministry said.</TE>
<TE>   American chicken has been popular in Russia since the first Bush
administration, when the drumsticks earned the nickname "Bush legs." At
the time, American tastes had swung in favor of white breast meat,
leaving chicken producers with a surplus of legs. Russians preferred dark
leg meat, and U.S. poultry became a $640-million-a-year export to Russia.</TE>
<TE>   The frozen legs, sold for about 65 cents a pound in Moscow, are
especially popular with pensioners, who can afford few other kinds of
meat. Before the embargo, Russia bought more than half of all the chicken
exported from the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Russian producers have been trying to break into the U.S. market
share, so far unsuccessfully. They accuse the United States of selling
the chicken legs at prices so low that local producers can't compete.</TE>
<TE>   That is the same complaint U.S. steelmakers aim at Russian steel
producers. The tariffs have hit Russia hard because steel is one of the
few manufactured products in which the country is internationally
competitive. Russian Economics Minister German O. Gref is in Washington
this week to discuss the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Viktor A. Kremenyuk, deputy director of the USA-Canada Institute in
Moscow, said Russian complaints about poultry disease and antibiotics are
just excuses for protectionism: "The chicken scandal was designed by
Russian poultry breeders with a sole purpose of boosting market prices
for poultry."</TE>
<TE>   However, he said, the timing was arranged for maximum political
advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-Americanism is on the rise in Russia, exacerbated by the U.S. war
on terrorism and by the Olympics judging and drug scandals that hurt
Russia's standing in Salt Lake City. After the steel tariffs, U.S.
poultry has become a popular target of discontent.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush is scheduled to visit Russia on May 23 to meet with
President Vladimir V. Putin.</TE>

<LD>In a move likely to further chill Mexico-Cuba relations, the
government announced that it will support a U.N. resolution censuring
Cuba for its human rights record.</LD>
<LD>   The measure recognizes social rights provided in Cuba but asks the
government "to make efforts to obtain similar advances in the area of
human, civil and political rights."</LD>
<LD>   Mexico, the only Latin American country that ignored U.S. pressure to
break diplomatic ties after Cuban President Fidel Castro's 1959
revolution, has traditionally abstained from the annual vote.</LD>
<TE>   Cuba insists that the United States pressured Uruguay to sponsor the
measure, and Havana is likely to accuse Mexico of caving in to U.S.
interests by supporting it.</TE>

<LD>The editor of Zimbabwe's only independent daily newspaper was
arrested on charges that he published false information on vote-rigging
in last month's presidential election.</LD>
<LD>   Geoff Nyarota, 51, editor of the Daily News, was detained by police
over a report in Wednesday's paper that said election authorities had
admitted that President Robert Mugabe lost the March 9-11 vote until
700,000 votes were mysteriously added to his tally.</LD>
<LD>   Under new media laws, Nyarota was charged with abusing "journalistic
privilege" and publishing false information, said his lawyer, Lawrence
Chibwe. Nyarota was freed after questioning and will be summoned to
appear in court later.</LD>

<HD>Pilot Among 38 Survivors of Jet Crash</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>KIMHAE, South Korea
</DL>
<LD>The captain of an Air China aircraft that crashed in South Korea on
Monday killing 119 people is alive and in a hospital but not talking
about the accident, a South Korean official said today.</LD>
<LD>   The death toll from the crash on a mountainside in Kimhae, near Pusan,
rose overnight after a survivor died, said Cho Kwang Sig of the Home
Affairs Ministry's emergency situations center.</LD>
<LD>   There were 155 passengers and 11 crew members aboard. Thirty-eight
survivors were in the hospital, 28 of them in serious condition, Cho
said. Nine people remained missing.</LD>
<TE>   Scenes at the crash site on a muddy wooded slope near some apartment
buildings made it clear that it was remarkable that anyone had survived.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Kap Seung of the Pusan regional aviation authority said the
captain's name was Wu Xinlu and gave his age as 32.</TE>
<TE>   South Korean television showed the captain in a hospital bed, his
mouth swollen and cut. Cho said the man had lost some teeth.</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear whether other crew members had survived, although the
New China News Agency said two flight attendants were among the
survivors.</TE>
<TE>   In the Kimhae City Hall cafeteria, relatives wailed as an official
read out seat numbers of those bodies recovered. A Pusan prosecutor said
that he had toured morgues overnight and that so far only three of the
corpses had been identified.</TE>
<TE>   Flight CA-129 from Beijing hit the wooded mountainside in fog and rain
in Kimhae, where the airport serving Pusan is located.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the survivors were in the front section of the 17-year-old
Boeing 767, local media said.</TE>

examiners who fail them on the spot.</LD>
<LD>   "As well as death and rape threats, and trashing of vehicles, there

<HD>31 Jailed Officers Released in Mexico</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Tijuana chief is among those freed from group of 41.
All are told further investigation is possible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>Mexican officials said Monday that they had released 31 of the 41
Baja California law enforcement officers arrested in a sting operation
last week, including the Tijuana police chief, but charged the remaining
10 with having links to the Arellano Felix drug cartel.</LD>
<LD>   The officers were rounded up Wednesday at a Tecate police academy
where they had been summoned under the pretext of having their firearms
checked. Army units and special federal police took them into custody and
flew them in three military aircraft to Mexico City, where the 31 who
were freed had been held until Sunday along with the others.</LD>
<LD>   Tijuana's top policeman, Carlos Otal Namur, and a deputy, Jesus Jacobo
Aguirre, were among those released. An assistant state prosecutor,
Rogelio Delgado Neri, was also freed. All those released were told they
were subject to further investigation.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for Tijuana Mayor Jesus Gonzalez Reyes said Otal Namur
would be suspended until his legal situation was clarified. The city
named an interim replacement last week.</TE>
<TE>   The 10 officers remaining in custody are accused of being linked to
the Arellano Felix gang. A federal judge now has 72 hours to decide
whether the charges warrant trial. In the meantime, the suspects have
been sent to the La Palma maximum-security prison near Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   Among the 10 are Mario Anaya Morales and Juan Cristobal Aguilar, two
high-ranking state police in the Mexicali area.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, the federal attorney general's office said the 10 are
suspected of having provided information to the Arellano Felix cartel in
such a way as to "obstruct the arrest of the principal leaders."</TE>
<TE>   The sting was the latest headline-grabbing move in President Vicente
Fox's offensive against drug cartels. The war has resulted in several
major arrests in recent weeks, including that of the drug lord the police
were allegedly working for: Benjamin Arellano Felix, who was arrested in
Puebla on March 9.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with the Reforma newspaper after his release Sunday,
Aguirre said that he and others were treated roughly when they were taken
into custody by army units in Tecate and that the arrests were based on
unfounded anonymous accusations.</TE>
<TE>   "We have nothing of luxury, we have no money, and they can confirm it
by seeing our houses in Tijuana," Aguirre told the newspaper. "I couldn't
even afford a 15-year birthday party for my daughter."</TE>

<LD>Hong Kong denied entry to prominent human rights activist Harry Wu
for "security reasons," a Hong Kong-based watchdog group said.</LD>
<LD>   The Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy said that Wu,
65, a U.S. citizen, was detained at the Hong Kong airport late Sunday. He
was held for 11 hours, then was put on a plane to Washington, where he
had come from. State Department spokesman Philip T. Reeker said the U.S.
was concerned by Wu's exclusion.</LD>
<LD>   In 1995, Wu was arrested by Chinese authorities as he tried to sneak
into the mainland to collect data on China's penal colonies. He was
expelled after being sentenced to 15 years in jail. Wu had spent 19 years
in Chinese prison camps.</LD>

<HD>U.S. to Carefully Study New Video</HD>
<DH>Reaction: Officials say every attempt will be made to extract data
from Bin Laden tape.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>U.S. authorities said Monday that they will scrutinize a video
apparently made by one of the 19 hijackers in the Sept. 11 attacks to see
what it can tell them about the terrorist plot and who else might have
been involved in it.</LD>
<LD>   The satellite television network Al Jazeera released two video
segments Monday, including one in which a bearded young man identified as
hijacker Ahmed Ibrahim A. Al Haznawi reads a prepared statement vowing to
help send a "bloodied message" to the world.</LD>
<LD>   "It is time to kill the Americans on their own soil among their sons
and next to their soldiers and intelligence agencies," the man says on a
portion of the tape aired by the Qatar-based network, which broadcasts
throughout the Arab world. A translated version was rebroadcast globally
by CNN. "We killed them outside their country, praise be to God, and
today we kill them on their own soil."</LD>
<TE>   Al Jazeera said the taped statement was part of an hourlong
documentary. The network said the statement was taped several months
before the Sept. 11 attacks but did not elaborate on how it knew that.</TE>
<TE>   The video shows a man who bears a striking resemblance to
FBI-distributed photos of Haznawi. Behind him is an image, apparently
electronically inserted, of the World Trade Center in flames after the
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Al Jazeera said that it received the tape several days ago and that it
was recorded in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI immediately said it would do its own translation and assign
forensic experts to pore over the tape, as well as the other video
segment, which shows Osama bin Laden and top aide Ayman Zawahiri.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has said that Haznawi, a 20-year-old Saudi Arabian, was aboard
United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed in rural Pennsylvania.
Authorities believe that the plane was headed for the White House, the
Capitol or another Washington landmark but that a struggle involving
passengers somehow forced it down before it reached its intended target.</TE>
<TE>   If the man is indeed Haznawi and if the tape was made months before
Sept. 11, it could be an indication that co-conspirators in Afghanistan
and elsewhere were aware of the terrorist plot long before the attacks
were launched.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we're going to be interested in seeing the full tape, and
we'll analyze it carefully and try to glean any insights we can," one
U.S. official said. "There are lots of questions about these
attacks--we'll see if the entire tape sheds any light."</TE>
<TE>   One question, the official said, is why Haznawi was selected to
videotape what amounts to a last will and testament and whether any of
the other 18 hijackers did the same.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators were taking a cautious approach to evaluating the
significance of the tape.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to see if it's real," a law enforcement official said.</TE>
<TE>   Another U.S. official said the CIA was taking steps to authenticate
the tape and review it for possible leads.</TE>
<TE>   Counterterrorism officials noted that such "last will" tapes have
surfaced from other Al Qaeda members who are wanted by the FBI, but not
from any of the hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   Haznawi was not one of the higher-profile hijackers and is not
believed to have been one of the pilots. But he did appear to have ties
to alleged plot leader Mohamed Atta and another of the pilots, Ziad Samir
Jarrah.</TE>
<TE>   Jarrah is believed to have accompanied Haznawi to a South Florida
hospital emergency room last summer for treatment of a blackened lesion
on his leg. The doctor who saw him has since speculated that the lesion
was cutaneous anthrax, a speculation that has been rejected by federal
authorities, who say they still have no suspect in the anthrax mailings
that killed five people.</TE>

<HD>Bin Laden Resurfaces on TV</HD>
<DH>Video: Arab network airs segment featuring Al Qaeda leader, another
with a Sept. 11 hijacker.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO
</DL>
<LD>Osama bin Laden and his allies surfaced in video and print messages
Monday, declaring the Sept. 11 attacks on America a "great victory" and
predicting triumph over "our American and Jewish enemies."</LD>
<LD>   Once again, a calm, turbaned Bin Laden came to life in a video
delivered to the satellite network Al Jazeera. As Bin Laden quietly
stroked his beard, his closest aide, Ayman Zawahiri, gave what the
Arab-owned station called the strongest evidence to date that Bin Laden's
Al Qaeda network was responsible for the attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "The great victory was achieved because of God's help and not because
of our efficiency or power," Zawahiri said while seated on the ground
beside Bin Laden.</LD>
<TE>   A separate segment on the same tape showed a man identified by the
network as Ahmed Ibrahim A. Al Haznawi, one of the hijackers on board
United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed in Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   But if America's most wanted men thought they would be able to rebuild
support by tapping into the seething anger at the United States and
Israel sparked by the Israeli offensive in the West Bank, they seem to
have miscalculated.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, there was frustration that Bin Laden distracted attention
from the Palestinian cause or appeared to give justification for Israel's
offensive. For more than two weeks, Israel has battled its way through
much of the West Bank in an operation it says is aimed at destroying a
terrorist infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   "I am concerned about the timing of the broadcast of the tape at a
time when the [Arab] nation is worked up against Zionists," said
Montasser Zayat, a lawyer who once represented Zawahiri.</TE>
<TE>   Al Jazeera, a Qatar-based satellite network, broadcast segments of the
video that it said it received several days ago.</TE>
<TE>   But that was only half the day's news: Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed
Omar, who like Bin Laden has so far escaped capture, showed up in the
pages of the London-based Al Hayat, a widely circulated Arabic-language
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   The man who once ruled Afghanistan and gave Bin Laden and his legions
sanctuary issued a statement to the newspaper's Cairo office. Although
there was no way to independently verify the statement, veteran Al Hayat
reporter Mohammed Salah said he was confident it came from Omar.</TE>
<TE>   "The war against Islam and the Muslims is a flagrant crusader war. . .
. The Jews and the Americans are one army on one mission in their war
against us, and are cooperating openly to implement it," Al Hayat quoted
the statement as saying.</TE>
<TE>   "Our American and Jewish enemies will lose at the end of the battle.
We are convinced that God will not ignore his faithful worshipers, and
victory will come at his will," the statement continued.</TE>
<TE>   Salah, who frequently writes about Islamic extremists, said he too was
troubled by the timing of the statement and video. He said he believes
that Bin Laden, Zawahiri and Omar are alive and that they somehow
coordinated the media blitz.</TE>
<TE>   "I am really upset with the timing," he said. "I believe this is bad
for the Palestinians. Such a tape comes at a time when [Secretary of
State Colin L.] Powell is in the region pressuring leaders and religious
leaders to condemn terrorism, and this just gives [Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel] Sharon the opportunity to continue his terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has accused Bin Laden of masterminding the Sept. 11 attacks,
which killed about 3,000 people in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania.
The attacks precipitated the U.S.-led war on terrorism, including the
campaign against Afghanistan that routed the Taliban and smashed Al Qaeda
infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, videotaped messages by Bin Laden have been funneled to
Al Jazeera. News officials at the station said that, just as with all
past tapes, the most recent video was delivered with no way to trace who
sent it or where it came from. It was not clear when the video of Bin
Laden and Zawahiri was shot.</TE>
<TE>   Al Jazeera editor Ibrahim Hilal said that the tape is about an hour
long and that the network would run additional segments Thursday. He said
it had no intention of airing the entire video because parts were
unsuitable for viewing.</TE>

<HD>Anti-Terrorism Drive Idling</HD>
<DH>U.N.: 50 nations haven't sent plans for the battle. Impact on
networks' financing is limited.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>More than six months after the Security Council launched its global
campaign against terrorism, 50 countries have failed to respond to its
demand that all U.N. member states submit their plans to participate in
the fight, and diplomats here have been unable to reach even tentative
agreement on exactly what terrorism is.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Western diplomats who are spearheading the
counter-terrorism drive said the council is making "significant progress"
in securing cooperation from most of the 189 nations represented here.</LD>
<LD>   So far, however, the committee charged with implementing the program
has had only a limited impact on the financing and mobility of global
terrorist networks, British diplomats acknowledged.</LD>
<TE>   Jeremy Greenstock, the British ambassador who heads the committee,
told the council that 143 nations had provided the reports on
anti-terrorism policies that were requested shortly after Sept. 11. The
deadline for the reports was the end of last year, but the council has no
direct enforcement powers.</TE>
<TE>   The council's aim is a kind of "world audit," Jean-David Levitte, the
French ambassador to the United Nations, said Monday, with experts
examining anti-terrorism provisions in statute books and banking
transactions and immigration records in all U.N. member states. The
findings of these anti-terrorism auditors, however, will not be made
public.</TE>
<TE>   The council's anti-terrorism directives have targeted only groups and
individuals said to be linked to Al Qaeda. Largely as the result of
direct U.S. action or pressure, international banks have frozen about
$100 million in accounts held by individuals, charities or businesses
allegedly tied to Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden, Sudan and other U.N. members not on the council have objected
to its reliance on secret Western intelligence reports in identifying
alleged Al Qaeda operatives, contending that legitimate entrepreneurs may
have been unfairly penalized. But council members say they have been
convinced that the intelligence reports are accurate.</TE>
<TE>   The counter-terrorism committee has reviewed and responded to 62 of
the 143 reports it received from U.N. member states and four observers
and expects to complete the remainder before June, Greenstock said. On
Monday, the United States and other member nations urged the committee to
actively pursue the 50 countries that have not yet responded to the
council's questionnaire on local anti-terrorism laws and practices.</TE>
<TE>   But sanctions or other measures against non-responding countries
appear unlikely, diplomats say. "The lack of compliance may be due more
to a lack of resources than a lack of political will," suggested Spain's
U.N. ambassador, Inocencio Arias, speaking to the council on behalf of
the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   And no nation has publicly defied the committee, while the list of
countries that supplied reports includes Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Cuba
and Syria--all accused by Washington of harboring or supporting
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   After all the reports are reviewed, the committee will move on to the
more politically problematic phase of its work: evaluating whether U.N.
member states are in fact taking the anti-terrorism actions they say they
are taking, a process that some diplomats say could stretch into 2003 or
beyond.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. General Assembly, meanwhile, stymied by a deep rift between
the Western powers and leading developing nations, has quietly suspended
its quest for a consensus definition of terrorism. Such a definition is a
prerequisite for a long-delayed international convention that would give
the U.N. efforts legal teeth by criminalizing terrorist activity anywhere
in the world.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, backed by most European nations, says the
convention should not apply to any acts of violence against civilians
committed by the military forces of recognized states--a provision fought
by Arab states and others that insist that "state terrorism" should also
be penalized.</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, Greenstock said, the Security Council will consider
terrorism to include "any act that all 15 council members believe to be
an act of terrorism."</TE>

</DL>
<LD>The treatment of Al Qaeda and Taliban suspects at the U.S. military
base in Cuba undermines human rights and may be cruel and degrading,
Amnesty International said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   In a 62-page memo sent to the U.S. government, the human rights group
also accused Washington of flouting international law by refusing
detainees access to legal counsel.</LD>
<LD>   "The U.S. government must ensure that all its actions in relation to
those in its custody in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay comply with
international law and standards," the group said. "This is crucial if
justice is to be done and seen to be done, and if respect for the rule of
law and human rights is not to be undermined."</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. Embassy in London declined to comment on the report. U.S.
military officials say about 300 detainees from 33 countries are being
held.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups have expressed concern that Washington is
reserving the right to try the captives on its own terms and is calling
them "unlawful combatants" instead of "prisoners of war"--a designation
that would bring them under the Geneva Convention.</TE>

<LD>Four American servicemen were killed and another was wounded in
Afghanistan on Monday when a rocket they were trying to disarm exploded,
U.S. defense officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The 107-millimeter rocket was part of a cache of weapons confiscated
in recent days by U.S. forces near the southern city of Kandahar.</LD>
<LD>   The explosion brought to 37 the number of Americans killed in the
Afghan theater since the U.S. military campaign began Oct. 7. The last
time an American was killed was March 28, when a Navy SEAL stepped on a
land mine near Kandahar.</LD>
<TE>   The wounded soldier in Monday's incident was evacuated to a U.S.
medical facility near Kandahar, said Marine Lt. Col. Dave Lapan, a
Pentagon spokesman. The names of the dead and wounded had not been
released.</TE>
<TE>   "This tragic event highlights that, even when not actively engaged
against enemy forces, that our service men and women remain at risk as
they perform their mission around the world and particularly in
Afghanistan," Air Force Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   While the more than 5,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan have not engaged
in any major military operations in recent weeks, they have come under
attack a number of times while patrolling their positions or searching
the countryside for Al Qaeda and Taliban holdouts.</TE>
<TE>   And U.S. forces are continually in danger of accidental death in a
country pockmarked with unexploded land mines and other ordnance from
decades of war, and littered with weaponry left behind by fleeing Al
Qaeda and Taliban fighters.</TE>
<TE>   The latest deaths came on the heels of three skirmishes during the
weekend, an indication that with warmer weather, Al Qaeda and Taliban
fighters may be gearing up to fight again, Myers said.</TE>
<TE>   "We do expect more Al Qaeda activity as the snows melt and it gets
warmer," Myers said.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, gunmen ambushed a U.S. Special Forces unit traveling by
convoy with Afghan fighters on a nighttime patrol, triggering a shootout
that ended only after the Americans called in an AC-130 helicopter
gunship to drive off the advancing attackers. Several enemy fighters were
killed in the attack. The location was not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Before the ambush, the Special Forces team had found several weapons
storage sites containing rockets, mines, explosives and antiaircraft
artillery pieces. Pentagon officials said they believed the arms had been
used for training.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>The Saudi ambassador to Britain, a well-known poet in the Arab
world, has praised Palestinian suicide bombers and criticized the United
States in a poem published in a London-based newspaper.</LD>
<LD>   "You died to honor God's word," Ghazi Algosaibi wrote in "The
Martyrs," a short poem on the front page of the Saudi-owned Arabic daily
Al Hayat on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The poem praised Hayat Akhras, an 18-year-old Palestinian who blew
herself up in a Jerusalem supermarket, killing two Israelis and wounding
25 on March 29, the same day Israeli troops began their incursion into
the West Bank to crush Palestinian militias behind a wave of attacks.</LD>
<TE>   "Tell Hayat, the bride of loftiness . . . She embraced death with a
smile while the leaders are running away from death. Doors of heaven are
opened for her," wrote Algosaibi, the ambassador in London for more than
a decade.</TE>

<HD>'Alive Dead People' Living in a Paralyzed Bethlehem</HD>
<DH>Siege: Curfew keeps residents confined to their homes. Garbage and
sewage fill streets. Troops patrol, tossing grenades.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Locked inside his home in this holy town, Hassan Dalou finds it
hard to believe that for two weeks, the Israeli army has controlled the
garbage-choked streets outside his front door and enforced a curfew so
strict that it has created food shortages.</LD>
<LD>   Just down the road from the home where he and his family have lived
for generations, a grim standoff between the Israeli army and Palestinian
gunmen barricaded inside the Church of the Nativity continues, holding
Bethlehem hostage.</LD>
<LD>   Daily life has been paralyzed by the large deployment of troops around
the 4th century sanctuary, built on the site where Christians believe
that Jesus was born, and into the streets radiating from it.</LD>
<TE>   Living so close to the church, Dalou said, "I thought I was safe."</TE>
<TE>   Bethlehem residents have largely been confined to their homes, allowed
out only four times in two weeks to dash to food stores, where supplies
are dwindling.</TE>
<TE>   When they go into the streets, they find themselves maneuvering around
mounds of rotting garbage, through rivulets of raw sewage and past the
burned-out carcasses of cars.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Bethlehem shone as the crown jewel of Palestinian
tourism. The city attracted hundreds of millions of dollars for
development and restoration from international donors in the run-up to
the millennium. The money was spent on restoring Bethlehem's ancient old
city, upgrading electricity, water and sewage systems and building hotels
and other tourist facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a new look for the town," said Nuha Khoury, a professor of
medieval Islamic studies at Bethlehem University who lives across the
street from the destroyed offices of the Palestinian Authority.
"Bethlehem was trying to become a cultural center for the Palestinians,
and in the year 2000, this town was booming.</TE>
<TE>   "Now," she said sadly, "it is all destroyed in two weeks. Now death
rules this area."</TE>
<TE>Economic, Spiritual Ruin in the City</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 19 months of Israeli-Palestinian fighting and the army's
reoccupation have wrecked the city's infrastructure and deeply scarred
the psyches of its residents.</TE>
<TE>   Khoury said she has conversations all the time with students who
deeply admire the bombers who are strapping on explosives and blowing
themselves up in crowds of Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   "I ask them: What if there is a Palestinian Einstein among these young
people who have died?" said Khoury, 40. "The question for us as
Bethlehemites is, how are we going to rebuild? What will it cost--and not
just economically but spiritually?"</TE>
<TE>   Khoury and other residents complain that their plight has been
eclipsed by the focus on more than 100 militants, along with priests,
monks, nuns and Palestinian officials, who have been holed up inside the
Church of the Nativity since April 2. The Israelis are demanding that the
gunmen lay down their arms, surrender and face trial in Israel or go into
exile. The gunmen say they have no intention of allowing Israel to
determine their fate.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the church, dramas play out daily in the streets. Parents
hurry along deserted roads, their brows knit with worry, carrying
children to doctors or clinics in defiance of the curfew. Other parents
send toddlers into the streets to fetch food from neighbors or relatives,
betting that soldiers won't shoot at pint-size curfew violators.</TE>
<TE>   As the curfew continues, residents say, they are finding it hard to
buy fresh fruit, vegetables, meat and dairy products, as stores have
trouble getting deliveries from Israel or other parts of the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother," said Khoury, "is baking her own bread for the first time
in her life because many of the bakeries simply have stopped opening when
the curfew is lifted."</TE>
<TE>   Tanks rumbling down narrow cobblestoned streets have crushed dozens of
cars. Electrical lines and sewage pipes have been destroyed. Public
buildings and private homes have been badly damaged, and some have been
reduced to rubble.</TE>
<TE>   A trio of white dirigibles equipped with cameras floats high above
Manger Square, the site in previous years of joyous Christmas pageantry,
fueling rumors that Israel will soon lose patience with the gunmen and
storm the church.</TE>
<TE>   From inside the church, Palestinians warn that Israel will provoke a
blood bath if it sends in troops.</TE>
<TE>   The Dalous have suffered both material damage and trauma as the
standoff has worn on. All the windowpanes of the home, where Dalou lives
with his wife, four children and elderly parents, were blown out during
the first days of fighting.</TE>
<TE>   The children sleep on mattresses laid on the floor of the living room.
But Dalou's parents refused to abandon their bedroom. "My father is 90
years old, and he said, 'Son, I do not fear death,' " Dalou said. " 'Let
me sleep in my own bed.' "</TE>
<TE>   An auto upholsterer, Dalou stapled fabric to the window frames in his
parents' bedroom to keep out the cold.</TE>
<TE>   There has been little fighting for days now, he said, but on Sunday,
explosions rocked the family home again as Israeli troops walked down the
street, tossing hand grenades into crushed cars.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they were afraid the cars might be booby-trapped," Dalou
said. "But they gave us no warning, and the children were terrified." One
blast was so powerful that it blew the back fender of a car onto the roof
of Dalou's three-story home.</TE>
<TE>Residents Watch TV News Endlessly</TE>
<TE>   Dalou's eldest daughter, 17-year-old Effat, said the curfew has numbed
her senses. She does nothing but watch television news, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "My mind is blocked," said the teenager, still clad in pajamas at
midday. "I can't do homework, I can't read books. I'm just sitting. Young
people are dying, we aren't living anymore, we are just alive dead
people. I feel useless. People are getting killed, and I can't do
anything about it. I can't help anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Effat said she tries to help her younger brothers, who have been
terrorized by the gun battles outside their door.</TE>
<TE>   People across Bethlehem said they watch television endlessly for news
on Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's peace mission or local bulletins
announcing when and for how long curfews will be lifted.</TE>
<TE>   In the Dahaishe refugee camp in southern Bethlehem, brothers Mahmoud
and Said Atallah have a special interest in the news. Both men have sons
inside the Church of the Nativity. Each time there is a report of gunfire
in the area, troop movements or diplomatic efforts to resolve the
stalemate, the Atallahs call the cell phone number of one of the fighters
inside the church and ask to speak to their sons.</TE>
<TE>   "My son, Zeid, is 17 years old," Mahmoud Atallah said. "He was in
Manger Square the day the troops came and fled to the church, but he is
not in any militia."</TE>
<TE>   He said Zeid's older brother, Jad, was a militant with the Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigade, which is linked to Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement and has claimed responsibility for some
suicide bombings. Jad was killed March 8 in an Israeli helicopter attack
as he drove through the refugee camp. Now, Atallah said, he fears he may
lose another son.</TE>
<TE>   "We talk to him every day. We ask how he is, whether he is eating," he
said. "He always says he is fine, he is eating, he is happy. But we know
that he is lying. He just doesn't want us to worry."</TE>
<TE>   Said Atallah said his 23-year-old son, Mohammed, also is a member of
the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades. The young man joined two years ago, after
his father lost an eye when he was shot by Israeli troops during a
demonstration, Atallah said. "He wanted revenge," the construction worker
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could see him come home," Atallah said. "But it is in the
hands of God now. . . . I want us to forget about all this and open a new
page in our lives. But if the Israelis make us lose our children in that
church, there will be more and more Al Aqsa Brigades."</TE>

<HD>Pro-Israel Demonstration Draws Tens of Thousands to Washington</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Likening Israel's offensive in the West Bank to the U.S. war on
terror, tens of thousands of demonstrators converged on the Capitol on
Monday in what organizers proclaimed the largest pro-Israel rally in U.S.
history.</LD>
<LD>   Speakers and demonstrators alike praised President Bush for standing
with Israel in the Middle East conflict, but they also raised pressure on
his administration to avoid making deals with Palestinian leaders until
terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians cease.</LD>
<LD>   Bush sent his deputy defense secretary, Paul D. Wolfowitz, to the
rally as a sign of support.</LD>
<TE>   But Wolfowitz, while reiterating Bush's commitment to support Israel
and stamp out global terrorism, drew scattered boos when he declared:
"Innocent Palestinians are suffering and dying in great numbers as well.
It is critical that we recognize and acknowledge that fact."</TE>
<TE>   Congressional leaders from both parties also addressed the crowd from
a podium decked with American and Israeli flags. One demonstrator even
planted a blue and white Israeli banner atop a Civil War monument on the
National Mall.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a message to the American government and to the world that
the support for Israel in the American Jewish community and among friends
of Israel in the non-Jewish community is wall-to-wall, from left to
right," said Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and dean of the Simon Wiesenthal
Center in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers claimed that more than 100,000 people came to the event on
less than a week's notice.</TE>
<TE>   Federal and District of Columbia authorities do not give crowd
estimates, in an effort to avoid political controversy. But Monday's
gathering was clearly substantial. The crowd spilled from the front of
the Capitol toward the Reflecting Pool on the Mall, packing the area
between Constitution and Independence avenues.</TE>
<TE>   It was the largest demonstration in Washington by the American Jewish
community and supporters since a 1987 rally for Soviet Jewry. Hier and
others said it was the largest in this country specifically aimed at
supporting Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd heard fiery anti-terrorist speeches from former Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel and Israeli
Cabinet member Natan Sharansky.</TE>
<TE>   Other speakers included former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani,
House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) and House Minority Leader
Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.).</TE>
<TE>   Though many in the crowd were from the Northeast, the event drew
people from around the country.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Goller, 34, a software programmer from Cincinnati, said he
came to show that "support for Israel isn't something that's confined to
a few congressmen or a couple thousand Jews in New York."</TE>
<TE>   Goller said he supported the Israeli military drive against
Palestinian targets in the West Bank, despite civilian casualties.
Comparing the action to the recent U.S. campaign that toppled the Taliban
regime in Afghanistan, he said: "Wars are messy, and ground wars are
particularly messy. Civilians are never out of the cross-fire. But I
don't think the Israelis have a choice."</TE>
<TE>Comparisons to U.S. War in Afghanistan</TE>
<TE>   Only a few people in the crowd voiced questions about an aggressive
Israeli military operation that the Bush administration is seeking to
restrain.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by a reporter whether they support the Israeli government's
actions, some boisterous university students from Pittsburgh shouted,
"One hundred percent!" and "One thousand percent!"</TE>
<TE>   But one woman in the group ventured: "I'm not going to say 100%. It's
a hard choice to know what to do in times of war."</TE>
<TE>   Most demonstrators insisted that Israel had as much right to pursue
suicide-bombing terrorists as the United States had to launch its
military campaign against Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 attacks by
suicide hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the crowd were particularly irate at European criticism of the
Israeli offensive.</TE>
<TE>   "The world has a double standard when it comes to fighting terrorism,
especially the European community," said Benji Kessler, 30, of Queens,
New York, a high school teacher who brought his students to the rally. He
added that the European reaction brought back "awful memories" of the
Holocaust. "If anything, they should have learned from what happened 60
years ago and should stand by the Israelis."</TE>
<TE>   Among those interviewed, there was little criticism of Bush's demand
for the Israeli military to pull back from positions it has taken in the
West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm supporting both countries--the United States and Israel," said
Regina Barker-Barzel, 54, a Jew who escaped from the Soviet Union in the
1970s and now lives in Virginia. "We have to be hand-in-hand."</TE>
<TE>Speakers Careful Not to Criticize Bush</TE>
<TE>   Speakers at the rally also were careful not to criticize Bush as
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell travels the Middle East in an effort
to defuse tensions.</TE>
<TE>   Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986,
said part of the demonstration's goal was to voice "our fervent support
for President Bush's war on terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   But some speakers offered the administration blunt advice.</TE>
<TE>   Said Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.): "We say to Secretary Powell, as
you move around the Middle East, you must insist to the Arab nations that
they stop . . . legitimizing homicide bombings."</TE>
<TE>   Referring to Sept. 11, Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) told the crowd:
"Americans do not want to be victims again. Nor can we expect Israel to
stand idle while its citizens are being slaughtered."</TE>
<TE>   Those sentiments, shared by many leading Republicans, could lead
Congress in coming days to take up legislation in support of Israel--even
if only a symbolic resolution.</TE>
<TE>   One demonstrator held up a sign that compared Bush's choices to those
faced by leaders of Western democracies during the years before World War
II. It read: "President Bush: Be America's Churchill, not our Neville
Chamberlain."</TE>

<HD>Massacre Allegations Smolder in Camp Ruins</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Palestinians are convinced that Israelis slaughtered
several hundred people in Jenin. But few bodies have been recovered.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JENIN REFUGEE CAMP, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>The center of this refugee camp is a vast wasteland, where scores
of homes have been leveled into rubble and the stench of death hangs in
the dust-choked air.</LD>
<LD>   An area greater than two football fields, once teeming with children,
chickens and angry residents, is now a sea of concrete chunks, pieces of
glass and metal, and scattered items of clothing--largely the work of a
legion of Israel's armored bulldozers and missile-firing helicopters.
More than a scene of combat, the place looks like it was flattened by an
earthquake.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the mystery remains: How many people were killed here, and what
happened to the bodies? The Palestinians are convinced that a massacre
took place, that Israeli soldiers slaughtered several hundred men, women
and children. Israel says there was a fierce battle but no massacre, and
that "dozens, not hundreds" of Palestinians were killed, the majority of
them fighters.</LD>
<TE>   The Jenin camp, home to at least 13,000 refugees, was indisputably the
theater of the deadliest fighting in the 18-day-old offensive in the West
Bank, which Israel says it launched to wipe out terrorism. In addition to
the Palestinian casualties, 23 Israeli soldiers were killed here,
including 13 who died in a single ambush. Palestinians in Jenin, home to
numerous suicide bombers, used explosives and rigged many of the homes
with booby traps.</TE>
<TE>   Stoking the confusion and heated rhetoric over what really happened,
the army for days after the fighting ended banned all journalists, relief
workers, medical personnel and the International Committee of the Red
Cross from entering the camp. In the last couple of days, the army has
begun to take reporters in on guided and highly restricted visits, and a
few reporters have managed to sneak in with the help of local people who
spot tanks and point out safe, if circuitous, routes.</TE>
<TE>   On one such tour Monday, reporters reached the center of the camp,
ground zero of this conflict.</TE>
<TE>   As the journalists picked their way through back alleys and partially
destroyed homes, dozens of survivors emerged tentatively for the first
time since the offensive began, to assess the damage and look for missing
friends and relatives.</TE>
<TE>   "This is where all the killing was," Hania Kabia said, waving her arms
over the mountains of rubble. Kabia's house faces the devastation but was
spared, she said, because soldiers used it as a post. Like many
residents, she insisted that numerous Palestinians lay entombed in her
wretchedly altered surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   As yet, it has been impossible to verify large numbers of dead. No
clear evidence has emerged so far to corroborate the assertion of a
massacre. Both sides agree that, at the least, about 100 fighters
probably died, along with civilians.</TE>
<TE>   While there are pockets that smell of death, the odor is not as
pervasive as might be expected if hundreds of corpses lay underneath the
rubble. Witnesses can offer the details of a handful of deaths, including
executions and the killing of civilians in their homes, but there are so
far no long lists of dead, nor witness accounts of mass murder.</TE>
<TE>   There is clear evidence, however, of destruction that seems to go
beyond the stated goal of fighting terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Intense combat usually leaves buildings with innumerable bullet holes
or gaping gashes caused by rockets and artillery. Here, the buildings
have been demolished, apparently to clear a path for tanks to enter the
camp more easily. The army has not fully explained the wreckage, other
than to describe the Jenin operation as ferocious house-to-house combat
in which militants fought from homes in the camp's center and set off
scores of explosions that did considerable damage.</TE>
<TE>   The practice is not a new one for Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon,
whose nickname is "The Bulldozer" because of his hard-driving style.
Forces commanded by him leveled homes in the West Bank village of Kibya
in 1953 in retaliation for the slaying by Palestinians of a Jewish woman
and her two children. Sixty-nine people were killed in the houses, about
half of them women and children. Sharon said at the time that he believed
the homes were empty. The episode earned Israel its first formal U.N.
condemnation.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Monday, the army, forced by a Supreme Court decision, allowed
the Palestinian Red Crescent Society to enter the Jenin camp for the
first time to retrieve bodies.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Crescent teams entered about 7 a.m. and immediately
encountered a body hanging out of a window of a smashed house. Then they
found the body of a renowned militia commander wanted by Israel. They
found a woman in her 50s near the central square, and then two more men
on the northern edge of the camp. Closer to a U.N. building, they found
three corpses but could only remove one because the other two were
wearing belts of explosives like those used by suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   The seventh body recovered Monday was of a fighter who had been shot
in the forehead at close range, according to Dr. Mohammed abu Gali of the
Jenin hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The teams found seven other bodies, but they were trapped in heavy
rubble and could not be removed.</TE>
<TE>   In another neighborhood, Ali Damage, the head of local emergency
relief committees, had taken refuge on the unfinished top floor of a
neighbor's house--along with 30 other people--after the bulldozers
arrived on his street. In scarcely 10 minutes, he said, the bulldozers
systematically plowed through six homes, sending families into flight and
killing a mentally impaired man who insisted on staying at his house.</TE>
<TE>   "If Charles Dickens came here, he would be paralyzed trying to
describe the destruction and punishment of a people," Damage said.</TE>

<HD>Political Rival Arrested in Sheriff's Slaying</HD>
<DH>Crime: He and two others are accused in the death of a Kentucky
lawman, fatally shot from a distance as he left fish fry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two days after Pulaski County, Ky., Sheriff Sam Catron was killed
by a long-distance rifle shot to the head, one of his campaign rivals and
a worker for the rival campaign were arrested in connection with the
crime.</LD>
<LD>   The bizarre revelation was made all the more so by the memory of
another crime, committed 44 years ago in the same town, Somerset: Catron
was 4 and playing in his house when his father, the police chief, was
shot and critically injured on the porch by an alleged bootlegger. Harold
Catron would die of his wound seven years later.</LD>
<LD>   Jeffrey Allan Morris, 34, who was challenging Sam Catron as he ran for
his fifth term as sheriff, was being held late Monday on suspicion of
complicity to commit murder. A man who worked on Morris' campaign,
Kenneth White, 54, was being held on the same charge. The alleged
shooter, Danny Shelley, 30, was captured Saturday night after wrecking a
low-slung, dark-purple motorcycle as he tried to escape. The motorcycle,
police soon learned, was registered to Morris.</LD>
<TE>   Under Kentucky law, all three could face the death penalty. They were
being held without bond.</TE>
<TE>   Morris came under suspicion within hours of the slaying Saturday
night. He had in fact worked for Catron as a deputy for several years in
the 1990s. Jim McWhorter, who was sworn in as sheriff following Catron's
death, said Monday he knew of no animosity between the two men and did
not know why Morris had left the department.</TE>
<TE>   "After several interviews with [Morris], we were able to determine
that he, along with Mr. White, had knowledge of the crime and were
complicit in it," Kentucky State Trooper Craig Sutton said late Monday.
"We feel like we have the three involved. We don't expect any more
arrests."</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday night, Catron, 48, was doing what most Kentucky county
sheriffs do come election time: shaking hands, meeting his constituents,
bidding on homemade cakes at the Somerset Volunteer Fire Department's
annual fish fry. He auctioned a couple off, bought another two for
himself.</TE>
<TE>   A sheriff known for leading from the front--personally piloting
helicopters in his ongoing crusade against the area's many marijuana
growers, patrolling just like his deputies--Catron was wearing his
uniform, but it was unclear whether he was technically on duty.</TE>
<TE>   Determining that may be a key point if the cases come to trial.
Prosecutors probably would argue any rural sheriff is on duty around the
clock. In Kentucky, killing a police officer who is on duty is much
likelier to lead to capital charges.</TE>
<TE>   The husky, affable Catron, who first took office in 1985 and retained
it with a coin toss after a tie with Kay Stringer in 1998, was facing
Morris and several other candidates in a May 28 primary.</TE>
<TE>   About 7:15 p.m., a cake in each hand, he headed out of the fire
station and toward his patrol car, police say, apparently going home for
the night. He had put one of the cakes on the top of his car when the
shot rang out. Catron died immediately, the coroner said.</TE>
<TE>   The shot, from a 25-06 hunting rifle, came from a nearby hill, "a
considerable distance," according to a preliminary report, where
witnesses saw a man running, then climbing aboard a motorcycle and
speeding west on Highway 80. As calls went out for police backup, one of
Catron's deputies and a volunteer firefighter gave chase, catching up
with the motorcyclist after just a few miles.</TE>
<TE>   The assassination could not help but remind old-timers and colleagues
in the town of 11,000 of the day in 1957 when Catron's father was shot.
Harold Catron was on his porch when a black Buick slowly approached,
according to court documents and the local paper, the Somerset
Commonwealth Journal. The car slowed and an accused bootlegger named
Robert Stephens, who for years had been feuding with the police chief,
stuck the barrel of a 16-gauge shotgun out the window and fired.</TE>
<TE>   Harold Catron was struck in the back by dozens of pellets. At least
one remained lodged near his heart and was blamed for his death in 1964.
Stephens shot and killed himself before trial.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Catron was inside the house at the time. He first became a police
officer in his early 20s. He always wore his protective vest.</TE>

<HD>Crowded Vans Give Rise to Rollovers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Putting 10 or more people in large vans built and marketed for up
to 15 occupants dramatically increases the risk of a rollover crash, a
federal safety agency warned Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The rollover rate of large vans carrying 10 or more occupants is
nearly three times higher than when they have five or fewer people on
board, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in new
research. The vans typically are used to transport groups such as church
members, farm workers and college athletes.</LD>
<LD>   Calling it "an issue of central importance," NHTSA head Jeffrey Runge
said the safety agency is considering a mandatory warning sticker on all
new 15-passenger vans. "Warning labels may be effective," Runge said.
However, he suggested that driver actions are more of a problem than the
design of the vans in the deadly crashes.</LD>
<TE>   A leading safety researcher responded that the government's warning,
the second such alert in as many years, will do little to save lives.</TE>
<TE>   "A vehicle isn't safe to operate when you can cause it to roll simply
by putting in the number of occupants the manufacturer has installed
seats for," said independent statistician Randy Whitfield, who six years
ago helped identify the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Public Citizen, the consumer group founded by Ralph Nader, called the
NHTSA's action "ineffectual" and said the agency should issue an advisory
that no more than five people ride in the vans.</TE>
<TE>   The National Transportation Safety Board said it is conducting its own
study and expects to issue recommendations to the NHTSA and the industry
within a year.</TE>
<TE>   Auto makers say the vans are safe and that many accidents and injuries
could be prevented if drivers were more careful and all occupants wore
seat belts. "We don't think there is any vehicle problem," said Sarah
Tatchio, a spokeswoman for Ford, the leading maker of large vans.</TE>
<TE>   Ford uses the driver's manual to warn consumers that large vans can be
susceptible to rollover, Tatchio said. But the auto maker does not place
a warning sticker in the vans, as it does in sport utility vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The NHTSA study found 388 rollovers involving 15-passenger vans from
1990 to 2000, and that 558 people died in the crashes. The study
considered only those vans configured to transport passengers and not
those used as work vans.</TE>
<TE>   The annual average of 51 rollover fatalities in large vans is small
compared to the more than 40,000 people killed every year in all vehicle
crashes. But accidents involving large vans tend to be especially tragic
because the victims are often young people, the elderly, or members of
community organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Loading the vans increases the risk of rollover because it has the
effect of raising the vehicles' already high center of gravity, NHTSA
officials said. As more passengers and cargo are added, the gross weight
of the vehicle increases, and more of that mass is located farther from
the ground. The officials also recommended against hefting heavy articles
onto roof racks. The agency's statistical study also found that swerving
was much more likely to trigger a rollover in a large van than in other
passenger vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Runge recommended that organizations select only experienced people to
drive large vans, that drivers be rested and avoid high speeds, and that
the tires be properly inflated and in good condition. All occupants of
large vans should wear seat belts, Runge stressed, since they greatly
reduce the chance of being flung from the vehicle in a rollover.</TE>
<TE>   "The vehicles themselves are not inherently dangerous," Runge said.
"Our comments are directed toward the training of the drivers. This is
not a defect issue as much as a behavior issue with drivers and
passengers."</TE>
<TE>   But Whitfield said his research showed that half of the drivers
involved in large van crashes were older than 34. "These are not young,
aggressive kids," he said. "And where do you go to learn to drive a
vehicle that can suddenly become unstable?"</TE>
<TE>   Whitfield said the manufacturers of large vans should be required to
certify a safe weight for the vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's the responsibility of the manufacturer to tell consumers
what is the maximum weight at which these vans can be loaded, and still
be safe to operate," he said.</TE>

<DL>LAS VEGAS
</DL>
<LD>Winds gusting up to 90 mph swept blinding dust across the city
Monday, closing the airport and cloaking the Strip with near-zero
visibility.</LD>
<LD>   The winds caused tall office buildings to sway; resort casinos closed
pools and outdoor attractions as tree limbs whipped violently.</LD>
<LD>   "These are the strongest winds I've seen in years," said forecaster
Don Maker of the National Weather Service here.</LD>
<TE>   Gusts outside his office were clocked at 69 mph, and a spokesman for
the Stratosphere Tower, the tallest building west of the Mississippi,
said winds at the top of it were measured at 90 mph. Similar gusts were
reported along Interstate 15 approaching Las Vegas from the south.</TE>
<TE>   The winds, which began Sunday evening and were expected to subside
overnight, were caused by an unusually strong low-pressure system out of
Alaska that was moving across the deserts of Southern California,
northern Arizona and southern Nevada and Utah.</TE>
<TE>   No serious injuries were reported, but fire and rescue personnel said
several people were struck by airborne trash cans and other debris.</TE>
<TE>   Local hospitals reported emergency rooms filled with patients
complaining of asthma, eye irritation and ankle sprains from being
knocked down by gusts. Air quality authorities issued a warning at noon
for people to remain indoors because of windblown dust.</TE>
<TE>   At nearby Lake Mead, seven occupants of a houseboat were treated for
hypothermia after it was swamped in high waves, according to the Clark
County Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout town, billboards were ripped apart and trees were uprooted,
taking power lines down with them.</TE>
<TE>   "We're running short [of available firetrucks] all over the valley,"
said Tim Szymanski, spokesman for Las Vegas Fire and Rescue Services
Department. "Everybody's out working right now, crisscrossing the
valley."</TE>
<TE>   Nevada Power Co. said outages affected 85,000 customers.</TE>
<TE>   Air traffic was halted at McCarran International Airport at 1:15 p.m.
due to limited visibility, but operations returned to normal later in the
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The dry, cold front was expected to reduce temperatures here from the
mid-90s to the mid-70s today.</TE>

<LD>Astronauts sent the international space station's rail car down a
short stretch of track, but it hit a snag that interrupted its inaugural
run in orbit.</LD>
<LD>   Engineers suspect the 1-ton rail car floated slightly off the track.
The vehicle won't roll completely off because of the steel girder holding
it to the space station, said NASA's Ben Sellari.</LD>
<LD>   " . . . What we're finding out as we go through this is how the mobile
transporter works in zero-g," said Sellari.</LD>

<LD>The fight over one of the nation's longest-running school busing
programs ended when the U.S. Supreme Court turned away a plea from black
parents to keep Charlotte's schools under federal oversight.</LD>
<LD>   The Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system in 1970 became the first major
urban district in the nation to use court-ordered busing to achieve
racial balance. The high court upheld the plan in 1971.</LD>
<LD>   The high court's refusal to hear the dispute this time marked the
official end of the program that bused urban students to mostly white
suburban schools and suburban students to the urban areas.</LD>
<TE>   A lower court ruled in September that the school system can go forward
with a new student-assignment plan that does not use race as a factor.</TE>

<HD>Illinois Panel Proposes Broad Reforms in Capital Punishment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Illinois must implement sweeping changes to improve fairness in how
it imposes the death penalty, but no amount of reform can guarantee that
an innocent person will not be executed, according to a report issued
Monday by a bipartisan commission appointed by the state's governor,
George Ryan.</LD>
<LD>   The report, perhaps the most comprehensive study of capital punishment
prepared by a governmental body, makes 85 recommendations, including
reducing the number of crimes eligible for the death penalty from 20 to
five and banning the execution of the mentally retarded.</LD>
<LD>   The commission declined to recommend abolishing the death penalty but
acknowledged that a "narrow majority" of its 14 members favored ending
it.</LD>
<TE>   Issued two years after Ryan declared a moratorium on executions in
Illinois, the report recommends that no one be sentenced to death based
solely on the testimony of a single, uncorroborated eyewitness or the
unverified testimony of a jailhouse informant.</TE>
<TE>   The commission also called for videotaping of police interrogations of
suspects in homicide cases; adoption of statewide standards when the
death penalty should be used; strengthened procedures to ensure that
competent attorneys are appointed to represent defendants in capital
cases; and creation of a statewide independent forensics laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   The commission was headed by a former federal judge, Frank McGarr; a
former U.S. senator, Paul Simon; and a former federal prosecutor, Thomas
P. Sullivan. The panel said the recommendations would "significantly
improve the fairness and accuracy of the Illinois death penalty system."</TE>
<TE>   Commission members cautioned that they were "unanimous in the belief
that no system, given human nature and frailties, could ever be devised
or constructed that would work perfectly and guarantee absolutely that no
innocent person is ever again sentenced to death."</TE>
<TE>   Since Illinois reinstated capital punishment in 1977, the state has
imposed 263 death sentences and executed 12 inmates. About 60% of those
sentences were reversed for a variety of reasons--including police or
prosecutorial misconduct, ineffective assistance of counsel and mistaken
identification.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen individuals who were sentenced to death were cleared and
released from prison, including one man--Anthony Porter--who had ordered
his last meal. Porter's exoneration prompted Ryan, a Republican who had
supported the death penalty as a legislator, to impose the moratorium in
January 2000, saying he would permit no executions until he had "moral
certainty that no innocent man or woman is facing a lethal injection."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Ryan said the moratorium would remain in effect "at least
as long as I am governor." His term ends in January.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan is the only U.S. governor to have declared such a moratorium and
his action made Illinois a centerpiece in the death penalty debate.</TE>
<TE>   "What we do will be watched by the rest of the country and the world,"
Ryan said at a Chicago news conference in which the commission presented
the report to him.</TE>
<TE>   "This study is a road map of how to approach the problems of the death
penalty," said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Washington-based
Death Penalty Information Center, a group opposed to capital punishment.
"They looked at all the dimensions of the issue."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the 207-page report, supplemented with about 600 pages of
appendixes, covers subjects ranging from police misconduct to
shortcomings in how the criminal justice system treats the family members
of murder victims.</TE>
<TE>   "In medical terms, our report calls for triage, an attempt to staunch
the extraordinary rate of errors, reversals and convictions in capital
cases," said Sullivan, the former prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   "The message from this report is clear: Repair or repeal. Fix the
capital punishment system or abolish it. There is no other principled
course," said Sullivan, who is now a partner at Jenner &amp; Block, one of
Chicago's largest law firms.</TE>
<TE>   Columbia University law professor James S. Liebman, who has conducted
extensive research on the death penalty, said the proposal to limit the
situations when capital punishment could be imposed is perhaps the most
significant in the report.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is any one thing that causes Illinois to stand out as a risk
factor for error [it] is its long list of aggravating circumstances that
make someone eligible for the death penalty. If you really want to do
something serious about the death penalty problem, you have to do
something about the range of cases to which the death penalty applies,"
Liebman said.</TE>
<TE>Reforms May Face Legislative Obstacles</TE>
<TE>   The report recommends eliminating one of the criteria most often used
to make a defendant eligible for the death penalty--a murder that is
committed in the course of another felony, prime among them robbery or
rape.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who would remain eligible for capital punishment are
individuals accused of multiple murders or the slaying of a police
officer or a witness.</TE>
<TE>   Former Sen. Simon emphasized that although the report found "no
statistical evidence" of racial discrimination in how the death penalty
is applied in Illinois, "in reality the death penalty is reserved for
people who do not have enough money to defend themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Many proposals require action by the Legislature and are likely to
face a chilly reception in the Republican-dominated state Senate.
Democrats have a majority in Illinois' lower house but success is not
assured there either.</TE>
<TE>   Nine measures are pending in the Illinois General Assembly related to
death penalty reform. These include a bill that requires videotaping of
interrogations in capital cases, one of the key recommendations in the
Ryan commission report.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Michael Madigan (D-Chicago), the speaker of the
Assembly, said he was not optimistic about the prospect for reform. "We
have introduced a bill on videotaping confessions the last two or three
sessions and it has gotten nowhere because prosecutors and police have
argued that such a regulation would tie their hands in terms of
effectively investigating capital crimes," said Steve Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Cook County State's Atty. Richard A. Devine in Chicago said his office
had not had time to thoroughly review the report. He said that
"prosecutors, among others, have a concern that some of the proposals . .
. appear to be grounded in a fundamental distrust of police officers."</TE>
<TE>   "We must be careful that suggested procedures do not simply help
suspects by making it impossible for police to conduct an effective
investigation into our most heinous crimes," Devine said. About 53% of
the inmates on Illinois' death row are from Cook County.</TE>
<TE>   There are 160 people on death row in Illinois. The commission
indicated that since none of the proposed reforms would apply to them
that perhaps some consideration should be given to reducing their
sentences.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Ryan suggested in a speech that he may commute a number of
those sentences to life without the possibility of parole before he
leaves office. On Monday, he said he had made no decision on that issue
or any of the commission's other proposals.</TE>

<HD>Bush Asks Congress to Make Tax Cuts Permanent</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa
</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Monday urged Congress to make permanent the
10-year, $1.35-trillion tax cuts enacted last spring, warning that their
scheduled expiration could hurt the economy and cost 104 million
taxpayers an average of $1,040 a year.</LD>
<LD>   If the broad tax relief package is allowed to lapse, taxes would
increase by more than $200 billion in 2011, according to the White House.</LD>
<LD>   Congress, however, is unlikely to comply with Bush's request.</LD>
<TE>   The president traveled to Iowa to issue his plea, timed to coincide
with the deadline for filing income tax returns. It was in Iowa, as a
presidential candidate in December 1999, that Bush unveiled his sweeping
tax cut proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, Bush attended a $500,000 fund-raising dinner for Rep.
Greg Ganske (R-Iowa), who is favored to win the GOP nomination to
challenge incumbent Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin in November.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's dual-purpose appearance in Iowa is part of his escalating
effort to draw distinctions with Democrats on domestic issues and help
GOP candidates around the country as the November elections approach.</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Dick Cheney was in neighboring Illinois on Monday,
speaking at a fund-raiser for GOP Rep. John Shimkus.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's call for a tax cut totaling $1.6 trillion was the centerpiece
of his 2000 presidential campaign. Although the bill that passed in May
fell short of his goal, the measure provided the largest tax reduction in
20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Its main provisions included phased-in cuts of income tax rates, a
gradual doubling of the $500-per-child tax credit for families, a new tax
deduction for college tuition and repeal of the estate tax.</TE>
<TE>   From the start--even at a time of huge projected budget
surpluses--many Democrats opposed Bush's initiative. Since then, the
disappearance of the budget surplus has virtually eliminated any chance
that, at least for now, Congress would agree to make the tax cuts
permanent. A few Democrats have urged repeal of some tax cuts yet to be
phased in, but the party's congressional leadership has steered clear of
that idea.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to a crowd of hundreds at General Mills Inc., one of this
city's largest employers, Bush said his tax cut softened the nation's
economic downturn. To date, he said, 974,000 Iowans have received refund
checks totaling $426 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Tax relief is absolutely right for America," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the law's sunset provision as "a quirk in the law," Bush
said: "I think that doesn't make much sense. It's going to be hard to
plan your future if you think all of a sudden [the tax cuts] get kicked
in full time and then go away."</TE>
<TE>   The tax cut measure included the sunset provision because, without it,
congressional rules meant the bill would have needed 60 votes to pass the
Senate. It ultimately passed 58 to 33.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP-controlled House has scheduled a vote Thursday on a measure to
make the tax cuts permanent. It is expected to pass on a virtual
party-line vote, but die in the Democratic-controlled Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Many Democrats have expressed concern about the fiscal impact of
extending the tax cuts just as retirements by the baby boom generation
are at their peak.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a
liberal-leaning research group, estimates that if the tax cuts are made
permanent, it would drain $4 trillion from federal coffers from 2013 to
2022.</TE>
<TE>   If, as expected, the bill to make the tax cuts permanent goes nowhere
in the Senate, some Republicans hope to put Democrats on the spot by at
least forcing a vote on extending one politically powerful element of the
package.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, the estate tax is gradually reduced over 10 years and
repealed in 2010, only to return the next year.</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks at General Mills and at Ganske's fund-raiser, Bush
provided his now-standard update on the counterterrorism campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "The cause is noble and the cause is just," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The president also repeated his intention to go after Iraq, a regime
that he said is a menace to the world because of its ties to terrorists
and its desire to develop weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   He also made a spirited pitch for his energy plan, most notably his
proposal to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and natural
gas exploration.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate is expected to take up the issue this week.</TE>

<HD>The Cheneys Earned Over $4 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife, Lynne, paid $1.7 million
in taxes last year on taxable income of $4.3 million, his office said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Their tax bill and income, while dwarfing that of President Bush and
his wife, Laura, declined sharply from 2000, when he was chief executive
officer of a Texas energy company.</LD>
<LD>   The tax return was prepared by the Dallas office of the beleaguered
accounting firm Andersen LLP.</LD>
<TE>   The president and his wife reported a net taxable income of $711,453
for 2001 and paid $250,221 in federal income taxes, according to their
joint tax return, which the White House made public on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The Cheneys' taxable income in 2001 was $4,356,625; their tax bill was
$1,720,271.</TE>
<TE>   The vice president's government salary was $174,475. According to his
office, Cheney received nearly $1.6 million in bonus or deferred
compensation from Halliburton Co., from which he resigned in August 2000.
In addition, he received $1.4 million as a cash bonus based on the
company's 2000 results and nearly $1.2 million from the exercise of stock
options and deferred compensation stemming from the disposal of holdings
and termination of relationships with companies on whose boards he served
before becoming vice president.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of big numbers, but he's also paying big taxes," said
Philip J. Holthouse, a partner in a Los Angeles accounting firm,
Holthouse Carlin &amp; Van Trigt LLP.</TE>
<TE>   The vice president's wife, who listed her occupation as "executive,"
reported income from the American Enterprise Institute, a public policy
research organization for which she works in Washington, as well as
compensation from Reader's Digest and American Express Mutual Funds, on
whose boards she serves.</TE>
<TE>   The Cheneys claimed itemized deductions of $48,483. His office did not
make available his Schedule A, the form listing specific deductions.
However, his statement said he and his wife made $79,275 in charitable
deductions--more, Holthouse said, than they were permitted to claim in
their overall itemization.</TE>
<TE>   A hint of the Cheneys' net worth could be seen in their listing of
$778,068 in tax-exempt interest. Holthouse said the vice president and
his wife would have to hold $10 million to $12 million in municipal bonds
to produce such interest.</TE>
<TE>   They put $334,336 into a self-employed retirement plan and applied the
$20,527 they had overpaid in withheld taxes last year to their 2002

<HD>For Argentine Ants in Europe, Life Is a Picnic</HD>
<DH>Biology: Mediterranean supercolony has grown massive by getting
along. In their native land, the insects fight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The massive supercolony of pesky Argentine ants that stretches
across California has been trumped: A newly discovered supercolony in
Europe is nearly three times as long, spanning the Mediterranean coast
from Portugal to Italy.</LD>
<LD>   Like the California supercolony, the European counterpart appears to
be so successful because the ants behave so strangely: Residents from
different nests cooperate and share instead of fighting one another to
the death as Argentine ants do back home.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists on both continents are having a difficult time explaining
just why these "tramp ants" are so nice to each other. The amiable
behavior among distant strangers contradicts a basic idea of evolutionary
biology called kin selection theory--the notion that gallant behavior
should persist only among related individuals because helping your kin
helps perpetuate the genes you share.</LD>
<TE>   In Argentina, typical ant behavior--defending boundaries, ripping off
the legs and heads of enemies and spurting out toxic chemicals--leaves
piles of wartime casualties and colonies about the size of suburban lots.</TE>
<TE>   The mellower Californian and European transplants by contrast share
what amounts to a peace dividend. Instead of using resources for war, the
peaceniks spend time looking for food and nurturing teeming numbers of
young. The result: massive supercolonies of ants that don't fight even
though they are unrelated.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear that in Europe the same thing is happening that's
happening here," said Neil D. Tsutsui, a postdoctoral researcher at UC
San Diego who published a paper with UCSD colleagues two years ago
showing that a huge empire of Argentine ants stretches across California
from Mexico to Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Unwilling to give up the mantle of largest supercolony just yet,
Tsutsui said it is possible that the California supercolony is larger
than reported and stretches outside his study area, deep into Mexico and
north into the Oregon woods.</TE>
<TE>   Argentine ants in Hawaii may also be members of the California colony
that hitched rides to the islands in plants or the camping equipment of
tourists, he said. In this era of globalization, it is possible that
European and California ants are members of the same globe-spanning
supercolony.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers determine if ants from different areas are part of the
same supercolony by pairing them in miniature gladiatorial bouts in the
lab. Members of the same supercolony occasionally tap each other with
their antennae but tend to peacefully coexist. Members from different
colonies, however, rise up on their rear legs, spray venom and bite each
other to shreds.</TE>
<TE>   The huge numbers of Argentine ants in California--too many even for
scientists to estimate--swamp the armies of larger native ants, kill
rival queens, take over nest sites and munch on all available food. Their
success has meant trouble for coastal horned lizards, which are starving
as their accustomed food--native ant species--disappears. The lizards
won't make a meal of the bitter-tasting Argentines.</TE>
<TE>   In his paper two years ago, Tsutsui, who calls the success of the
invading ants "testimony to the power of cooperation," had proposed that
the amiability of local ants was due to their lack of genetic diversity.
Some of their genes are so similar, he suggests, that they treat each
other like kin even though they are not related.</TE>
<TE>   Such "genetic bottlenecks" often result when a small number of
individuals establishes a new population far from home. It is thought
that Argentine ants reached the U.S. in small waves in the late 1800s
aboard coffee and sugar ships from South America. But the new research,
led by biologist Laurent Keller of the University of Lausanne in
Switzerland, suggests a lack of genetic diversity is not enough to
explain the ants' communal behavior.</TE>
<TE>   The European ants still have a fair amount of genetic diversity.
Keller's research suggests that the unusual amount of cooperation among
them comes about because natural selection has favored those less likely
to fight. Over time, he suggests in a paper published in today's
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, this resulted in a kind
of "cleansing" of the recognition cues ants normally use to tell friend
from foe.</TE>
<TE>   But the normally peaceful ants will still fight if confronted with
ants from different colonies. That, researchers say, shows that genetic
changes have not hampered the insects' natural aggressiveness or ability
to fight. Instead, evolution has altered their ability to recognize
enemies.</TE>
<TE>   "What's new is the suggestion that selection acts to winnow down
variation to minimize aggression between colonies," said Ken Ross, an
expert on genetics and ant social systems at the University of Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Keller's research provides strong evidence that the aggressive
behavior of ants is genetically and not environmentally determined.
Lab-born ants behave the same way as those from their home nests, he
said, suggesting that the aggressive behaviors are inherited.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the mystery, ants that share the same environment can also
fight their close neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   In California and Europe, pockets of ants exist in smaller colonies
within supercolonies. When these ants from the different groups meet,
they fight. Ants from distinct colonies near San Diego might fight, for
example, while ants from a San Diego colony might get along just fine
with other ants from Yreka, Tsutsui found.</TE>
<TE>   Keller found that--like an insect European Union--ants from Portugal,
Spain, Italy and even France got along. All except for a handful of
renegade "Catalonians" from the east coast of Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Future studies will try to infiltrate what Ross calls a "black box in
ant biology" and determine exactly what aspect of nestmate recognition is
altered by genetic changes. Are the pacifist ants not producing odors
that cause others to fight them? Are they not recognizing the odors on
their compatriots? Has something changed in the way they process these
odors in their tiny brains?</TE>
<TE>   "It's really unclear," said Tsutsui, who recently returned from field
work in Argentina and has more genetic studies underway.</TE>
<TE>   It's far too early, researchers said, to use what they are learning to
develop ways to kill off the ants or control infestations. Some have
suggested introducing ants from Argentina to boost genetic diversity in
populations so ants will kill each other off. It's unlikely that would
work, because the ants "would have to fight with the whole introduced
population to get established," Keller said.</TE>
<TE>   Added Ross, an expert in the biology of the even more troublesome fire
ant: "Introducing more of them is a bad idea under any hypothesis."</TE>

<HD>Common Weed Killer Causes Sexual Abnormalities in Frogs, Study
Claims</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences links atrazine, the most heavily used herbicide in the U.S.,
to an array of sexual abnormalities in frogs.</LD>
<LD>   The study, from Tyrone B. Hayes, a specialist in the hormone systems
of amphibians at UC Berkeley, comes as the Environmental Protection
Agency enters the final phase of a "special review" of the chemical,
prompted in 1994 by concerns over its prevalence in drinking water.</LD>
<LD>   Hayes' findings provide the latest evidence that commonly used
chemicals may alter hormone function in fish, reptiles and amphibians.
Since the mid-1990s, researchers in England and Florida have been
documenting sex changes in fish downstream from sewage outfalls and
alligators exposed to agricultural chemicals.</LD>
<TE>   Atrazine has not been shown to be dangerous to humans.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes first found that atrazine was a powerful endocrine disruptor in
frogs in a study completed last year. In a follow-up--the study being
published today--he found that exposure of tadpoles to water with 0.1
part per billion atrazine, or 30 times less than the amount legally
permitted in drinking water, produced frogs with mixes of testes and
ovaries. "The atrazine turns on an enzyme called aromatase," he said.
"This converts testosterone to estrogen."</TE>
<TE>   Recent studies by the U.S. Geological Survey have detected levels as
high as 2,300 parts ppb in water near agricultural areas.</TE>
<TE>   Biologist Darcy Kelly of Columbia University said Monday she isn't
sure that the studies make a definitive link between the herbicide, the
enzyme and the sex changes, but she said that the study should be taken
seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "You take the tadpoles, you give them a little bit of this herbicide
and you screw them up rather profoundly," she said. "How it works,
whether it has anything to do with human beings, I don't think those are
solved, but it's a cautionary note."</TE>
<TE>   Syngenta, the company that manufactures most of the atrazine sold in
the U.S. and paid for the first study, has rejected the results of Hayes'
research.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking from Washington Monday, Syngenta toxicologist Tim Panoor said
other studies commissioned by the firm produced contrary results. "No
conclusions can be drawn," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Release of the study comes on the day of a public hearing about the
safety of atrazine before the EPA makes a final decision about
relicensing the pesticide. The EPA is expected to make its relicensing
decision in August.</TE>
<TE>   Atrazine, first synthesized in Switzerland in 1955 by scientists for
J.R. Geigy (now part of Syngenta), was first licensed in the U.S. in
1959. Of the 75 million pounds now used in the U.S. every year, most are
applied in the Midwest on corn, sorghum and sugar cane crops. Corn
growers estimate it saves them $36 an acre by suppressing weeds, reducing
labor costs and increasing productivity.</TE>
<TE>   In California, 55,000 pounds are used every year, mainly in
agriculture. According to the Department of Pesticide Regulation, only
professional applicators are supposed to apply it around parks, schools
and home gardens. Syngenta sells it only directly to homeowners as a
turf-care product in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Georgia and
North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Combined use is so heavy that by the mid-1990s, the U.S. Geological
Survey found that it was the most frequently detected contaminant in
waterways.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, toxicity studies for farm chemicals are carried out on
lab animals, such as rats. A sudden crash in the global amphibian
population in 1989 prompted the U.S. Department of the Interior and a
number of federal agencies to set up the Amphibian Research and
Monitoring Initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Europe, concerns over high levels of atrazine detected
in drinking water led to bans in Switzerland, Sweden, Germany, Italy,
Norway, France and, most recently, Belgium.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1990s, under pressure from the EPA for new safety data,
Syngenta commissioned an estimated 100 new atrazine safety studies in
North America, including one from Hayes.</TE>

<HD>D.C. Banks Close on Bomb Threat Linked to Dutch Teen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A hoax by a 13-year-old Dutch boy shut down several bank branches
in the capital Monday after he phoned in a bomb threat to the local
police over the weekend, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The public prosecutor's office in the Netherlands said it had found
the boy, who confessed. Prosecutors informed U.S. authorities.</LD>
<LD>   "We have the idea that the boy acted on his own and that it was
intended as a joke," spokesman Wim de Bruin said, adding that the public
prosecutor would launch an investigation.</LD>
<TE>   Branches of Bank of America and Citigroup, among others, closed after
the FBI warned of an "unspecified" bomb threat.</TE>
<TE>   The caller had said the bomb would go off at a national bank in the
center of Washington at noon Monday, the FBI's Washington office said in
a written statement.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI said it did not have any reason to assign a "high degree of
credibility" to the threat against financial institutions, which was
telephoned Sunday from the Netherlands via a Canadian telephone operator.</TE>
<TE>   But the alert was a fresh jolt to a city whose nerves have been frayed
since the shock and destruction of the Sept. 11 attacks and a subsequent
scare over anthrax-laced letters sent to members of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Two Washington mail carriers died of anthrax, in addition to three
other people across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Even as news of the hoax filtered out Monday, Washington office
workers standing outside a downtown building with a Citibank branch said
they had been evacuated because of a bomb threat.</TE>
<TE>   Branches of SunTrust Banks Inc., Wachovia Corp.'s First Union and
Riggs National Corp., among others, were closed for the rest of the day,
officials with the institutions said. Citigroup and Bank of America said
they were unsure when their branches would reopen.</TE>
