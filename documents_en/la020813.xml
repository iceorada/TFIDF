<LD>Los Angeles gallery owner Debbie Weiss is standing at the edge of the
martini-sipping crowd, introducing a guest to the finer points of a
$600 piece titled "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace."</LD>
<LD>   "It's hand-painted," she notes. "I love color ... I love glass and
light." Usually, it's difficult to view this type of detail in the
work--unless one hits the "pause" button on one's DVD, Weiss
explains.</LD>
<LD>   That's because the image in question is an animation cel
featuring one of America's most recognizable faces--Homer Simpson.</LD>
<TE>   Here, the famously bald and beer-bellied fellow from the
television show "The Simpsons" is pictured as an astronaut waiting
for takeoff, and squirting "beer paste" into his mouth. "It's art,"
she says, "but it's also ... really fun."</TE>
<TE>   There's a good turnout for the Thursday night opening at Weiss'
Wonderful World of Animation gallery, one of about 50 galleries in
the world that is authorized by 20th Century Fox to sell the work.</TE>
<TE>   While most folks make a beeline from the gallery to the open-air
party in the back, a few loyal fans scan the work.</TE>
<TE>   A father and his son stand before an $1,800 piece designed to
mimic the Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" album
cover. "Where's Ringo and George and John?" the small boy asks,
scanning the Beatles-costumed Homer, Marge, Bart and Lisa.</TE>
<TE>   Next to a $550 piece titled "Happy Hour" that features Homer,
beer-in-hand, swinging from the rafters of his favorite bar, men
trade fears about the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   "Take WorldCom," says one. "It was good stock. Six months ago, it
was great stock." And what about Martha Stewart? "Is this a feeding
frenzy?" the man asks.</TE>
<TE>   A slim young woman in the group answers him: "Anyone who believes
she's Miss Perfect is totally out of their minds." Art as an
investment? It doesn't come up.</TE>
<TE>   Behind them, in a cel titled "Blackboard Bungle," Bart Simpson is
pictured in a schoolroom writing on a chalkboard: "I will not belch
the national anthem," "I did not see Elvis," and "I saw nothing
unusual in the teacher's lounge."</TE>
<TE>   Outside on the curb of chic south Robertson Boulevard, a line
begins to form. Someone starts handing out Marge Simpson lollipops.</TE>
<TE>   Candid Shots With a Hollywood Touch</TE>
<TE>   Several hundred people came to watch celebrities and see the
exhibit "Picturing a New South Africa: An Exploration of Culture and
Hope" Saturday night at Track 16 gallery in Santa Monica, causing
some traffic congestion at Bergamot Station.</TE>
<TE>   As organizers speaking from the corner stage frequently reminded
the crowd, the festivities had a serious purpose. The art show was
really an auction, hosted by actress Alyssa Milano and Venice Arts in
Neighborhoods, to benefit Nkosi's Haven, a South Africa-based charity
that helps mothers and children with HIV and AIDS. The show featured
Milano's photography from South Africa, as well as pictures by Ellen
Burstyn and students from Venice Arts, which matches young artists
with adult artist mentors.</TE>
<TE>   Milano, who went to South Africa for a movie shoot, spent three
months afterward volunteering at the Mandela Park Township,
photographing people and their environment. "The camera became my
best friend," she said. Coming back to Los Angeles was difficult
because of the sharp difference between "what I had learned there and
the person I had to be here," she said, adding, by way of
explanation, "Hollywood." "I turned into a missionary of sorts."</TE>
<TE>   Hence the show, in which her photos were displayed alongside the
work of the Venice Arts students who had visited Durban, South
Africa, last year. "They're enlightened at that age," one woman
remarked to her companion as they stood in front of a row of pictures
depicting AIDS orphans and demonstrations.</TE>
<TE>   Albert van Rensburg, the acting consul general of South Africa,
talked about the plague of AIDS, but many in the crowd were more busy
attracting the attention of waiters who passed drinks and appetizers
around. "I'm hoping you will all dig deep in your pockets," he
pleaded over the noise. And some did. The event, said organizers,
raised close to $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   When Burstyn arrived, photographers surrounded her to shoot her in
front of one of her own pictures--of a gorilla. "There are 350,000
orphans from AIDS," Burstyn said. And if that was not enough reason
for people to get involved, we should do it for our own sake, she
said. "It's not good for us to ignore it."</TE>
<TE>   One guest decided to pay attention and peeled away from his friend
to browse the gallery. "I'm going to bid on a picture," he promised.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll expense it."</TE>
<TE>   Downtown L.A.'s</TE>
<TE>   Star Attraction</TE>
<TE>   The new Standard Hotel in downtown L.A. has become a popular
locale for the business of famous folks. Around lunchtime Monday, Leo
DiCaprio was scheduled to hold a press conference at the Flower
Street hotel to urge President  Bush to help stop global warming and
attend the World Summit on Sustainable Development in South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Later that night, Moby and friends (David Bowie among them) were
set to take over the hotel's rooftop bar with a party to kickoff his
Area2 Tour, which hits the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in Irvine
tonight.</TE>

<DH>The art of the whip isn't just about arm movement. It's
about physics, focus and, for some, a spirituality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CINDY CHANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Wallace, like many a novice, is rushing his moves.</LD>
<LD>   "Bend your knees, use your whole body. Don't get ahead of
yourself," advises his teacher, Robert Dante, a ruddy-faced
Englishman-turned-Texan-turned-Californian with curly white hair and
penetrating blue eyes.</LD>
<LD>   To anyone who's ever taken a tennis l or golf lesson, Dante's
words ring painfully familiar. Here, though, is where the resemblance
to any run-of-the-mill sports lesson ends. Instead of a tennis
racket, Wallace holds in his right hand a 5-foot-long whip made of
braided kangaroo hide. The uniform for the sport of whip cracking,
judging by this teacher and student, is a black cowboy hat with a
black or white button-down shirt, black jeans and a Lone Star belt
buckle. The playing field is a weedy backyard in North Hollywood on a
searing late-July afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   The student practices his basic strokes--the overhand, which is
like throwing a baseball; the circus crack, a chopping motion like
wielding a meat cleaver; and the reverse snap, which is the circus
crack at a 45-degree angle across the body.</TE>
<TE>   He swings awkwardly, and the whip hesitates, failing to pick up
altitude and knocking against the brim of his hat. "I'm glad you're
wearing a hat," Dante comments wryly. Hats have protected more than
one aspiring whip cracker.</TE>
<TE>   When a whip is successfully cracked, it travels at the speed of
sound. The whip does not require contact with any surface--hard,
fleshy or otherwise to create that distinctive sound, which is as
sharp and deafening as any gunshot as it breaks the sound barrier. In
traditional herding cultures, the whip is prized for this noisemaking
capacity, as animals scamper away from the frightening noise and into
the pen, rather than for its ability to inflict physical pain.</TE>
<TE>   In Dante's hands, the whip is a serpent, undulating lazily just
above the ground. It is a stylus, tracing graceful figure-eights in
the air. It is a knife, slicing a playing card in half or snatching a
leaf from a tree. It is a musical instrument, cracking rapidly three
times, pausing, then cracking once more, like the rat-a-tat of some
gigantic drum. It is a lover's hand, gently caressing an outstretched
wrist as it drifts earthward.</TE>
<TE>   A lesson in the art of the whip is a lesson in mental focus, in
efficiency of motion, in channeling a smooth flow of energy from
torso to hand to whip. Those who have a background in a deliberate,
inward-focused martial art such as tai chi have the easiest time
learning the whip, Dante says.</TE>
<TE>   Even novices who are still trying not to hit themselves upside the
head can begin to appreciate the whip's spiritual dimension. "There's
a life force in this whip, common to the life force of the creature
it came from, extending from me, through this creature, into the
world. There's a spiritual focus," says Wallace, a mechanic for the
L.A. Unified School District, who prefers to be known by the single
name Faol, or "wolf" in Gaelic.</TE>
<TE>   A lesson in the whip is also a lesson in physics. Dante swings his
arm seemingly without effort and at no great speed. The whip's
tapered design sends it looping at ever-increasing speeds so that a
simple downward stroke of the human arm becomes a sonic boom by the
time the whip coils at its tip.</TE>
<TE>   For some, the whip is also a tool to test the boundaries of
sensory experience. Along with leather collars and handcuffs, whips
are part of the sadomasochist's arsenal. In addition to his more
traditional whip-cracking lessons, Dante gives workshops at S&amp;M clubs
around the country. Dante says only a small percentage use the whip
to inflict pain; for most, the possibility of pain is titillation
enough, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Whip enthusiasts caution against automatically associating the
whip with the darker side of human sexuality. "People assume that the
whip means kink. It's not true. The whip is a sport, a dance," says
Rob Monroe, an actor and member of the L.A. Whip Enthusiasts, a club
that meets once a month and has a mailing list of about 60 members.</TE>
<TE>   The whip has been used by herders since time immemorial.
Australian stockmen on horseback still use 7-foot whips to herd
cattle or sheep, never making contact with the animals but using the
sound of the whip to direct them. Sled-dog drivers use the whip to
urge their animals on. In Australia, whip cracking is a competitive
sport. At the Australian national championships, competitors perform
routines and are required to demonstrate accuracy by slicing foam
cups in half.</TE>
<TE>   In the heyday of the western movie, actors Lash LaRue and Whip
Wilson used whips to disarm opponents. More recently, whips have been
wielded by Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, Anthony Hopkins in "The
Mask of Zorro," and Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman in "Batman
Returns."</TE>
<TE>   "The whip says a great deal about the character, that she has
multiple layers, that she's playful, highly skilled, very dangerous,"
says Anthony De Longis, who trained Pfeiffer on the whip for the
Catwoman role.</TE>
<TE>   Back in North Hollywood, Wallace, nearing the end of an hourlong
lesson, is wreaking havoc on the backyard vegetation. Finally, a
jacaranda pod falls victim to his whip. He's not quite ready to slice
a playing card, but it's a start.</TE>

<HD>Turning Taboo Into Titles</HD>
<DH>Feral House's catalog reflects owner's penchant for the
bizarre</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADAM BREGMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the corner of Spring and 7th streets in a beat-up section of
downtown Los Angeles sits an old pillared office building that evokes
Raymond Chandler and his fictional hard-boiled private-eye character
Philip Marlowe. With its marble interior, large wooden doors and
loud, screeching elevators, it's easy to imagine various low-life
personalities drifting through its corridors.</LD>
<LD>   Up on the seventh floor, in a cluttered office and behind many
shelves of books, is Adam Parfrey, a rumpled maverick in the same
mold as Marlowe. Parfrey, 45, who smiles like a Cheshire cat and
peers out from behind the thick-rimmed glasses of an avid reader and
researcher, may very well be L.A.'s oddest publisher. Releasing
nonfiction books on subjects ranging from the unusual to the obscure
to the altogether unsettling, Parfrey's small company, Feral House,
operates according to the mercurial whims and obsessions of its
owner.</LD>
<TE>   In the Feral House catalog you'll find books on Hitler's Jewish
clairvoyant, Erik Van Hanussen; the dark history of prepubescent pop;
and various strange ideas about the origin of humans, from ancient
astronauts to aquatic apes. There's an investigation into the
marketing, art, history and consumption of pills, a survey of X-rated
outtakes from the Bible and numerous titles dedicated to Parfrey's
favorite book topics: Satanism, anarchism, death, serial killers,
punk rock and paranoia.</TE>
<TE>   In a day and age when publishing often succumbs to the bottom
line, Feral House is purposely uncommercial. It would be difficult to
fill a small room with people interested in some of the exhaustive
books Parfrey has published on obscure subjects. However, with nearly
no advertising at all, Feral House has managed some successes. The
company grosses about half a million dollars a year and is successful
enough for Parfrey to employ a small staff.</TE>
<TE>   Parfrey's first release, 1989's "Apocalypse Culture," a collection
of essays about the most demented fringes of outsider society, has
become an underground classic of sorts, selling about 70,000 copies.
(Parfrey put together that collection and a few other Feral House
titles on his own, though most are penned by others.)</TE>
<TE>   Additional Feral House hits include several books from Church of
Satan founder Anton LaVey; the exploitative "Death Scenes: A Homicide
Detective's Scrapbook"; the definitive work on the Scandinavian black
metal scene, "Lords of Chaos"; and the book that was the inspiration
for the Tim Burton film "Ed Wood," "Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life
and Art of Edward D. Wood Jr."</TE>
<TE>   "When there's not one advertisement or major review, it shows that
it absolutely must be word of mouth that sells these books," Parfrey
says as he tears through a heap of mail. "A book is seen at
somebody's house, or a manager at a bookstore finds one of our books
interesting enough to put at the top of the table. It's mystifying to
me how it works. You just put things out, because the usual promotion
methods don't really work for a house like mine. I'm very bad at
marketing, so I spend all my time dealing with the creation of the
book."</TE>
<TE>   Parfrey entered the book business in San Francisco in 1980 when he
discovered a Goodwill store that had dumpsters filled with donated
hardcovers and first editions to be thrown out.</TE>
<TE>   "I convinced the manager of the Goodwill to drop all those books
in a dumpster I rented," says Parfrey, "and I bought a pickup truck
for $200 to haul them away. I found all these bizarre old medical
textbooks that I was enamored of and these psychiatric case histories
that were astonishing. There are so many interesting books published
that you wouldn't know about ordinarily if you didn't go through
thousands of them daily. For a while I became the biggest Bay Area
used-book wholesaler. I intended to open up a store, but I noticed
all the used bookstore dealers in San Francisco were very sour,
grouchy men, and I was fearful of becoming that. So I sold all my
books and moved to New York."</TE>
<TE>   After working a minimum-wage job at Strand Books, Parfrey worked
for a publisher for a short time and later formed Amok Press with
associate Ken Swezey. In 1989 he moved to L.A. and started Feral
House.</TE>
<TE>   "I was going to do a magazine called the Journal of Unpopular
Views," says Parfrey. "And I had collected a lot of material, from
writers like [Jean] Genet, [Louis-Ferdinand] Celine and Wilhelm
Reich," whose works covered such topics as outlaw sexuality,
psychiatry and anti-Semitism. "But then I found this really freaky,
far-out stuff, and I was able to put it together in some way that
made sense. That was 'Apocalypse Culture,' which came out first on
Amok Press."</TE>
<TE>   Parfrey's office is stacked with paraphernalia from various
completed and future book projects. There are Osama bin Laden
T-shirts proclaiming "He isn't Terrorism He is Fighter," brought back
from Indonesia. Parfrey says Bin Laden is as popular there as Britney
Spears is here. The shirts, along with a map of Afghanistan and a
shelf of Islam-related books, were used for research for his recent
book "Extreme Islam," a somewhat random collection of anti-American
and anti-Israeli propaganda.</TE>
<TE>   "I think fundamentalism is frightening wherever you encounter it,
Judaism, Christianity or Islam," says Parfrey. "That to me is the
biggest evil in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Parfrey is currently immersed in a project on men's adventure
magazines from the early '50s. "There's never been a book on men's
adventure magazines," he says. "They were meant for vets and have a
patriotic fever that is similar to the time we're in now. I found
that Mario Puzo and Bruce Jay Friedman edited and wrote for these
magazines. It's a fascinating and forgotten part of American culture.
It went from G-rated magazines like True to spicier ones like Men and
Man's Adventure to truly fetishistic stuff like evil Nazis torturing
women. So they were catering to a fetishistic element in society
using World War II as a basis for it."</TE>
<TE>   Other upcoming Feral House projects include a book about Sidney
Reilly, who was involved in all sorts of SS espionage and was the
inspiration for the James Bond character; the story of Russ Columbo,
the crooner who died a mysterious death in 1934; and a book from
Reynaldo Berrios, the creator of the Northern California magazine Mi
Vida Loca, which will be a look at the cholo gang culture from
within.</TE>
<TE>   Parfrey plans to continue pursuing subjects that get very little
play in the mainstream press. "Just because something is not written
up in the New York Times or the Washington Post," he says, "doesn't
mean it's not relevant."</TE>

<HD>An S.O.S. From Preservationists</HD>
<DH>Architecture* Tear-downs of Neutra, Schindler homes lead to
calls for stronger protection of historic buildings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN FREUDENHEIM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under the knowing smiles of gold-winged cherubs, vestiges of the
former glory of the central lobby of the downtown Herald Examiner
building, a roomful of architectural historians and other interested
parties gathered Sunday to talk about what's gone wrong with
architectural preservation.</LD>
<LD>   It was a fitting setting for such a conference. Closed to the
public since the newspaper's 1989 shutdown, the now-worn structure
has since been a favored location site for Hollywood filming; its
eclectic design by architect Julia Morgan mixes Renaissance, Mission
and Moorish styles and was built for William Randolph Hearst even
before the designer and client embarked on their more famous Hearst
Castle at San Simeon. Designated as a historic landmark, it has been
saved but not yet preserved. Windows to the street have long been
boarded up, and its interior clearly shows years of neglect. Yet
there was hope in the room.</LD>
<TE>   Urban Partners, the development team that includes Ira Yellin, who
preserved such landmarks as downtown's Grand Central Market, has just
teamed up with the Hearst Corp. to market the building, which stands
at the corner of Broadway and 11th Street. They are hoping to restore
and adapt the structure to fit the needs of "creative tenants," such
as an architectural firm or a museum, Urban Partner's Devan M. Pailet
told the audience of about 100, virtually all of whom had raised
their hands when asked whether they had ever before visited the
building. His announcement was greeted with happy nods, as much of
Los Angeles' architectural history has long been closed off--or
lost--to even the most interested.</TE>
<TE>   Bad news inspired the panel discussion, which was moderated by
KPCC's Larry Mantle and will air on KPCC radio this morning. It was
organized by the Society of Architectural Historians, Southern
California Chapter, in response to recent tear-downs of three major
architectural residences in the region, only one of which has
received widespread attention. When the Maslon House in Rancho
Mirage, a much lauded 1963 home by the Modernist architect Richard
Neutra (1892-1970), was destroyed by its new owner earlier this year,
it surprised the preservation community; a collective cry of anguish
filled newspapers and architectural forums from L.A. to New York. Yet
no such outcry occurred at the destruction of two houses last year by
the equally renowned Rudolph Schindler (1887-1953)--the 1924 Packard
House in San Marino and the 1931 Wolfe House in Avalon, on Catalina
Island--the latter despite earlier reports that it had been sold to
owners interested in restoring it. No one knew, speakers at the
conference admitted. How could such information have passed everyone
by?</TE>
<TE>   "We were all shocked by these recent demolitions," said Ken
Bernstein, director of preservation issues for the Los Angeles
Conservancy, an L.A. County preservation advocacy group. "We can only
respond if we find out. In both of these cases, we never received a
phone call."</TE>
<TE>   Were the actions legal? In these cases, yes. Ordinances limiting
tear-down of historic properties exist in only a few cities, among
them Los Angeles, the conference's members made clear. And even those
ordinances often can only delay, and not absolutely prevent,
destruction of landmark buildings. As a result, many works of
architecture remain virtually unprotected from owners who choose to
radically alter or destroy them.</TE>
<TE>   Preservation, the speakers pointed out repeatedly, remains a
grass-roots effort, where neighbors are often the ones who alert
organizations such as the Los Angeles Conservancy to possible danger
of demolition. Warnings, these experts say, have come from anyone
from a devoted gardener to the preservation-minded seller who has
lost control of a once-prized architectural building.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had known even a week before, we might have been able to do
something" to save the Neutra and Schindler homes, said Alan Leib,
chairman of the Conservancy's Modern Committee. With public
structures, such as the endangered Trails Restaurant on Route 66 in
Duarte, people drive by and see that it is closed. Empty buildings
tell architecture and history enthusiasts there may be problems
ahead, but private residences are often hidden from view and
unprotected by such scrutiny. New owners who plan to demolish a
historic building are often "way down the road of escrow before
preservation people are alerted," Leib said.</TE>
<TE>   Although progress has been made, thanks to such organizations as
the conservancy, whose membership numbers about 7,000 and has grown
by 50% in the last four years, according to Bernstein, the problem is
long-standing. Neutra's son Dion Neutra stood up from the audience to
say that he has been getting calls about destruction of his father's
legacy since 1972. And the destruction persists nationwide. The
National Trust for Historic Preservation recently named "tear-downs
in historic neighborhoods" as one of "America's 11 most endangered
historic places" this year.</TE>
<TE>   When a city's records don't say which buildings should be
treasured, government officials don't know when not to issue a
demolition permit. Yet public embarrassment following such
destruction can do great damage to a city's image. Anger at the
widespread news of the loss of Neutra's Maslon house in Rancho Mirage
prompted city officials to begin a historic-resources survey, said
Peter Moruzzi, who founded the Palm Springs Modern Committee, an
advocacy group for the Coachella Valley, in 1999. This kind of
survey, along with preservation ordinances, allows officials to take
steps to delay and review any proposed demolitions.</TE>
<TE>   During a break at the L.A. conference, Leib said the issue is even
more grave than many realize. "The biggest-name architects represent
the smallest percentage of what has been destroyed," he said.
Secondary names are far more vulnerable, and he cited recent works by
such Modern architects as Welton David Becket, Kem Weber, Gregory Ain
and Wallace Neff that have been irreparably altered or destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   The only answer, participants said, is education. Realtors who
recognize that historic architectural properties have a niche market
can profit and serve the community simultaneously, Leib said. Selling
a landmark building as a tear-down is, he said, "the equivalent of an
art dealer selling a Picasso painting as an old canvas that can be
reused."</TE>
<TE>   Public radio station KPCC-FM (89.3) will air the two-hour program
in its entirety this morning at 9 on "Airtalk."</TE>

<HD>RE/Search goes to the source's mouth to document fringe
culture</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN CARPENTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a button-down shirt and sweater vest, V. Vale seems a little too
clean-cut to have published books on masochists, scarification, punk
rock and paganism. Mild-mannered and tattoo-free, he is the
antithesis of what one would expect from the revered independent
publisher of such countercultural classics as "Modern Primitives."</LD>
<LD>   Yet for 25 years, the fiftysomething founder of RE/Search
Publications has been carving out a niche at culture's cutting edge,
independently publishing magazines and books on subjects that were
once deemed unworthy for print and, as an unintended byproduct,
gently nudging them into the public consciousness.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't even know I was going to be a publisher," said Vale,
dressed head to toe in black for a recent interview outside the Andy
Warhol exhibit downtown. "[Then] I found myself at the very, very
beginning of the San Francisco punk rock scene."</LD>
<TE>   All it took was reading a number of derogatory articles that
"reduced punk to spitting and safety pins ... [and] I knew I had to
publish something that was the so-called truth," said Vale, whose
publishing house was once dubbed "the Underground's answer to Studs
Terkel" by the Washington Post.</TE>
<TE>   Though small, San Francisco-based RE/Search is credited with
beginning a fringe publishing phenom, one that includes Los Angeles
publishers Feral House and Amok Dispatch, and Juno Books in New York,
which was founded by former RE/Search co-editor Andrea Juno in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Vale's tactic for getting to that truth? Interviews, and lots of
them. All 11 issues of Search and Destroy, the punk rock magazine he
published from 1977 to 1979, and most of the 23 books he's helped
compile for RE/Search Publications, are in a Q&amp;A format--a format he
said was inspired by Warhol's then-nascent Interview magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "All he printed were interviews," said Vale, who was so impressed
with the publication that he copied the magazine's design for his
first Search &amp; Destroy. "I really believe in the interview as a
format to communicate [ideas] without pretentiousness.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted primary-source documentation because I knew that would
be quoted for years to come," he added. "It wasn't a writer's
theorizing. It was artists talking about what they do."</TE>
<TE>   Vale's interest in sword swallowers, drag queens and other fringe
characters is influenced by the French anthropologist Claude
Levi-Strauss, who believed that research should be thorough and
structural. Vale's goal in publishing is to document countercultural
lifestyles intelligently, accurately and from as many different
viewpoints as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "Every interview book has been a group project, and actually you
have collectively a much greater intelligence than any one person,"
said Vale, who co-edited RE/Search with his former girlfriend Juno
from 1984 to 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "My job is really to be the scribe in the Egyptian sense. The
Egyptian scribe was supposed to transmit every bit of arcana and
detail of Egyptian culture, mythology, whatever, as accurately as
possible. That's what I strive for."</TE>
<TE>   Today, RE/Search Publications, and its academic presentations of
edgy material, continue to be some of the best reference books on
subjects that were once considered too "out there" for New York
publishing houses. And their early books' impact continues to show in
pop culture.</TE>
<TE>   "Modern Primitives," the 1989 book that explored body modification
techniques, is credited with mainstreaming tattoos and body piercing.
When it came out, body modification was primarily practiced by
societal outcasts. These days, everyone from the kid bagging your
groceries to Shaquille O'Neal is sporting navel rings and tats.</TE>
<TE>   "Incredibly Strange Music," the 1993 guide to novelty albums, is
believed to have sparked a lounge-music revival. And "Incredibly
Strange Films," from 1986, prompted many otherwise obscure gore and
sexploitation films to be re-released on video.</TE>
<TE>   Those subjects, Vale says, were almost entirely inspired by living
at poverty level. He and his friends couldn't afford to see first-run
movies or to buy new records--thus the inspiration for Incredibly
Strange Music" and "Incredibly Strange Films." "Modern Primitives"
was inspired by a friend who collected old copies of National
Geographic.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all done from lack of money. Everything came from a thrift
store for a quarter," said Vale, who owns 15,000 books and 11,000
records.</TE>
<TE>   "We were always trying to give people the notion that someone they
had never heard of might actually bring a lot of value to their
lives," said Vale, who publishes out of his home in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Vale never expected to have such wide-ranging impact. The UC
Berkeley graduate had no career aspiration other than working as a
clerk at City Lights Books when he started Search &amp; Destroy. Vale put
together the magazine with an IBM Selectric II correcting typewriter
he used after hours at the bookstore. Using money he solicited from
legendary beatnik Allen Ginsberg and City Lights founder Lawrence
Ferlinghetti, Vale was able to print his first issue but had to rely
on the money he made through benefit concerts to keep the venture
going.</TE>
<TE>   He never made back any of the money he poured into the project and
stopped producing the magazine in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, Vale was approached by Rough Trade Records to launch a
similar magazine. A friend suggested he call it RE/Search. The
magazine lasted for three issues before the English record label
pulled the plug. It was losing too much money.</TE>
<TE>   Two books, including an early work by avant-garde feminist
novelist Kathy Acker, were published under the RE/Search moniker, but
it's the 1982 book about William S. Burroughs that is generally
recognized as the first RE/Search publication. It featured excerpts
from Burroughs' novels, original photos and an in-depth interview
that begins with the question, "You see Outer Space as the solution
to this cop-ridden planet?"</TE>
<TE>   Like he did with Search &amp; Destroy, in a Situationist act of
appropriation, Vale stole the design from a Rodchenko book, using
everything from the type font and size to the column width, even the
use of black bars throughout the text.</TE>
<TE>   The latest Vale book, "Modern Pagans," is an exploration of
paganism as "the postmodern religious alternative." The subject was
inspired by longtime Bay Area pagan John Sulak, who also conducted
numerous interviews for the book. As with all RE/Search subjects, the
book's purpose is Hegelian.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're not helping in your publishing to somehow illuminate or
map out more freedoms either psychologically, behaviorally or more in
your life," Vale asks, "then what's the point?"</TE>

<HD>Rape Publicity Strikes a Nerve</HD>

<LD>This week, the nation's most famous young rape victims stare out at
us from the cover of People magazine. And our hand-wringing over
whether to name them or not seems quaint; our concern for their
privacy misplaced.</LD>
<LD>   Still, the ordeal of the Antelope Valley teens who were kidnapped
and raped, then escaped, continues to stoke emotional debate among a
public divided over whether the girls should have been kept hidden
and whisked into therapy, or allowed a public forum to share their
tale.</LD>
<LD>   "You have teenage girls, Sandy. Do you feel you would have wanted
them in front of the cameras almost before the body of the rapist had
been removed?" wrote the outraged mother of two adult daughters, in
response to my Sunday column, in which I suggested that victim
anonymity only contributes to the stigma of rape.</LD>
<TE>   "These two girls had their bodies violated, their lives threatened
and had to attempt to kill their abductor. If that had happened to
me, as an 'older' adult, I know for certain that I would not have
been ready to face yet another horror, that of endless questions,
constant cameras in my face and the frenzy to get the best story.</TE>
<TE>   "I would want some private time to sort out my feelings, come to
grips with what has happened, get some professional help in dealing
with my emotions. Then I would get on with my life."</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure how much public scrutiny I would allow my daughters
to face. But if this saga has made anything clear, it's that there is
no straight line from rape to recovery. I don't imagine I'd want my
girls on TV, but neither would I presume that a few days at home
alone would make anyone forget what had happened to them.</TE>
<TE>   Rape strips survivors of a sense of control and replaces it with
vulnerability. These girls seemed to need to tell their story.
Perhaps they knew, better than we do, that a show of strength would
do more than a shrink to restore their stability.</TE>
<TE>   "I never asked for an interview and frankly never imagined she
would grant one," e-mailed a television reporter who spoke with one
of the girls in an interview broadcast on TV. "She wanted to talk.
She was so disappointed that the news reports were not including the
fact that [the girls] fought back, that they never gave up, and that
they used their brains to negotiate with their captor the entire
time.... They wanted other women to know that it's possible to
survive such an experience."</TE>
<TE>   One mother wrote to me said that she wishes her 20-year-old
daughter had such role models when she was raped several years ago.
Her daughter went for years without telling a soul, until her life
began to fall apart and she landed in therapy. "If my daughter did
not feel the shame or guilt or whatever stopped her from telling
someone about this, she would not have had to go through what she has
gone through these past several years," she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "I think high schools should talk about it more--not just how to
protect yourself from it but if it does happen, who to talk to. I
think society has to start talking about it more. We finally talk
about domestic violence, alcoholism and drug abuse and that has saved
many lives ... It would have been easier for my daughter if she did
not feel she had to hide."</TE>
<TE>   But many readers, particularly rape survivors, had mixed feelings
about the girls' bold stance and the openness it seems to reflect.</TE>
<TE>   "I am glad those two young women felt comfortable with going
public. I also believe that at some point in the future they will
deeply regret it," wrote a woman, who likened public identification
to pouring salt in a wound. "If you had published my name as a rape
victim that would be part of my identification by the rest of the
world for the rest of my life....I want to be known for something
good I have done, some accomplishment or contribution I make. Not for
the sheer notoriety of a crime I couldn't prevent. Isn't it enough
that I have to live with the knowledge of what that monster did to
me, without having all my teachers, co-workers and fellow citizens
looking at me with that sad, piteous look, knowing about my trauma."</TE>
<TE>   Some pointed out that, unlike the girls, many rape survivors don't
have the freedom that comes with the rapist's death.</TE>
<TE>   "My attack occurred over 20 years ago, and the legacy of that
horrible afternoon has stayed with me," wrote a woman who was
attacked by a serial rapist, who is due to be released soon from
prison. "And I still worry that he'll find me and rape me again."</TE>
<TE>   Fear, not shame, is the legacy most victims carry, she said. "We
were there. We know that it's not our 'fault.' It's the public that
persists in its notion of rape as a wild, dangerous form of sex, made
more exciting by the fact it's been stolen. We don't need the
public's prurient interest to help us come to terms with rape, much
less 'recover' from it, as you suggest we must."</TE>
<TE>   One thing the public discourse has made clear: We have come a long
way from the day when short skirts and tight dresses were blamed for
rape.</TE>
<TE>   "Times, they are a changing," wrote an elderly woman, who was
raped in 1940 when she was 14. "Him, they let go. Me ... well, I was
charged with 'enticement' and spent 14 days in Juvenile Home until a
social worker got me out. I don't know what scared me most, the rape
or the jail. And until I left town 6 years later, my name was 'mud.'
Don't ever let anyone say 'the good old days.' They weren't."</TE>
<TE>   But others say the pendulum may have swung too far, that we have
taken such pains to separate rape from sex that we have obscured the
true nature of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "You appear to be taken in by a politically correct, but factually
incorrect notion that rape is a crime of violence but not a sex
crime. This is a misconception espoused by those that have never
experienced the male libido," wrote one man. "Rape is a crime of
violence committed for the purpose of sexual gratification.... This
has nothing to do with blaming the victim, but it is necessary to
understand the motivation of the criminal to prevent the crime."</TE>
<TE>   And in our zeal to insulate victims from blame, we may be missing
a chance to talk to young women about their responsibility to conduct
themselves in ways that limit their vulnerability.</TE>
<TE>   The Antelope Valley girls were out after midnight, parked in a
desolate spot favored among young couples because it is so remote and
dark. That made them easy pickings for a kidnapper looking for a
target.</TE>
<TE>   Their story sent shivers through one reader, who was raped 30
years ago when she was 19, after a night of drinking with a fellow
she hardly knew. "My experience taught me something that most rape
victims don't seem to express," she wrote. "It taught me that I
needed to be more careful in my life, and that I needed to be more
responsible for decisions I was making about what people to be with
and what places to go."</TE>
<TE>   And that's something I hope those girls--and their parents--will
also say as they continue their media rounds.</TE>

<LD>TALES OF PROTECTION</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Erik Fosnes Hansen</LD>
<TE>   Translated from the Norwegian by Nadia Christensen</TE>
<TE>   Farrar, Straus and Giroux</TE>
<TE>   $26, 500 pages</TE>
<TE>   Think back to the childhood enchantment of bedtime stories. Safe
amid the covers, your head propped on a pillow, a captivating voice
lulled you into foreign worlds. Perhaps you fell asleep before the
resolution came, but no matter: The point of the tale wasn't the
outcome, but the story itself. Tomorrow night, there'd be a new tale.</TE>
<TE>   And though you might often miss the endings, you didn't much care.
As long as the voice kept flowing, all was right with the world.</TE>
<TE>   Reading Erik Fosnes Hansen's rich and detailed "Tales of
Protection" is a similar experience, adjusted for adults. As readers,
we relax into the author's skillful hands, allowing his luminous
writing to carry us, and the tale, along. The Norwegian author
("Psalm at Journey's End") has crafted in "Tales of Protection" three
distinct narratives, each of which is as self-contained as a novella.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen offers only the thinnest of filaments to link them: the
premise that chance and coincidence are more than meet the eye, that
seemingly random events are linked in a web of synchronicity we
cannot fully see. In this triad of stories, Hansen strives to
illustrate in quiet, enigmatic ways how everything is connected.</TE>
<TE>   The first tale, set in modern-day Norway, establishes this theme.
Wilhelm Bolt, a wealthy retired mining engineer, has become a
recluse, researching and documenting accounts of coincidences.
"Whether one calls it coincidence or fate is completely irrelevant,
because the strange thing is that anything even occurs.... That it
is, when it could just as well not be. That time passes at all, when
it could just as well not pass. That something happens, when it could
just as well not happen." By studying the social culture of bees, he
hopes to identify the veiled mesh beneath the surface of chance.</TE>
<TE>   Out of the blue--a coincidence?--his great-niece Lea happens on
his doorstep. A runaway, she finds a sense of belonging with the old
man, and Wilhelm, for his part, finds solace after decades of
loneliness. Together they study bees, looking for clues to the
"paradox of coincidence" in the behavior of drones, workers and
queens.</TE>
<TE>   The second tale is set in 19th century Sweden, on the remote mouth
of a fiord where the lighthouse keeper, Kalle Jacobsson, is
distraught after a ship has gone aground and all the sailors have
perished. His daughter Josefa, who sometimes sees and hears ghosts of
deceased sailors, falls ill while preparing the corpses for burial.</TE>
<TE>   Her birth, which had nearly ended in tragedy, we're told, was
saved by one of the lighthouse keeper's assistants, Enberg, who had
the foresight to row to the mainland for medical help although
there'd been no early sign of distress. Interestingly, it is Enberg
who was on watch the night the ship in question ran aground in clear
weather.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen's writing about lighthouse-keeping (like his scientific
analysis of bees) is skillful: how, exactly, a run-aground ship is
boarded, how the missing sailors are located, how lighthouses
function, how an isolated life on the mouth of a fiord unfolds. He
has a remarkable ability to pique our curiosity and then provide
lavish, satisfying details to sate that interest.</TE>
<TE>   Renaissance Italy is the scene for the final tale. Lorenzo del
Vetro is an exiled Florentine nobleman living in Rome who's been
afflicted with a painful, unrelenting skin disease. During a night of
revelry, he travels as a joke to view an old altar painting said to
have healing properties.</TE>
<TE>   Lorenzo is cured and spends the remainder of the tale trying to
figure out who painted the work, and what occurred during the
painting's creation that might explain its miraculous properties. We
learn of the painstaking process of gold-leafing, witness artists
working with egg tempera, and making charcoal with which to sketch.</TE>
<TE>   In approaching these tales with an analytical eye, it seems we've
entered independent stories, each utterly captivating yet lacking
individual endings and a collective conclusion. It becomes possible
to glimpse coherence only if we accept the author's premise that
everything is connected.</TE>
<TE>   Still, like the best bedtime stories, we're so wrapped up in each
tale's unfolding that we don't necessarily care whether last night's
narrative fits with tonight's. So wooed are we by Hansen's abilities
to take us to new worlds that we abandon the need to stay awake to
make sure it all adds up, giving ourselves over instead to the joy of
remarkable storytelling.</TE>

<LD>Whoever heard of using food to decorate an object? Thomas Germain
thought it was a nice idea. About 260 years ago, Germain made this
pair of large silver tureens (covered soup bowls) to hold a rich stew
of seafood and vegetables. If Germain's tureens look good enough to
eat, there's a reason for it. They were made from cauliflowers!</LD>
<LD>   First, he took a cauliflower and covered it almost completely in
plaster. Then he popped it in the oven for several days. During this
time, the vegetable slowly burned inside, until there was finally
nothing left of it. After it cooled, Germain carefully opened the
plaster mold and coated the inside with a thin layer of wax. Then he
filled the hollow cavity of the cauliflower mold with a mixture of
sand and plaster. He put the mold back together, melted the wax out,
and poured in molten silver. The silver filled the spaces where the
wax had been. After the silver cooled and hardened, the artist opened
the mold, refined details, and polished the dish.</LD>
<LD>   You can see this and other tureens at the Getty. Children 12 and
younger can receive a free postcard of the silver tureens shown here.

<LD>Your portrayal of people who adopt children of another race was more
promotional than factual ("Adopt, Then Adapt," Aug. 4).</LD>
<LD>   The natural mother of one of the children was deemed a breeder, or
"birth mother," who was flown from North Carolina to California by
the people who planned to adopt.</LD>
<LD>   That mother and child seemed doomed to adoption even before the
baby was born. Did the mother even have a chance to give the baby the
milk that nature intended before the couple whisked the child away?</LD>
<TE>   Why were adopters interviewed extensively, and yet no mother or
father who had lost a child to adoption interviewed?</TE>
<TE>   One other thing that was missing was the African American family
who had adopted a European American child. Where are those families?
Why are European American families so often the beneficiaries of
African American families and those of mixed heritage that are broken
up?</TE>

<TE>   Imposing ever more restrictions on our children after a

<LD>One summer evening Ruth and I were outside playing hopscotch.</LD>
<LD>   "Do you want to know what Daddy and my brother, Harry, are doing
in the basement of the shop?" Ruth suddenly asked me.</LD>
<LD>   "Sure," I answered. I was always eager to hear about the candy
shop, especially if it also meant getting a treat.</LD>
<TE>   "Me, too," said Ruth.</TE>
<TE>   "You mean that you don't know what they're doing?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth shook her head. "They are always whispering," she said. "But
I don't know what it's all about. Come on, let's go and see what's
happening."</TE>
<TE>   I agreed. We went around the corner, into the shop, and started
down the steps to the basement.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's there?" Mr. Burt asked.</TE>
<TE>   We called down to say that it was just the two of us. When we
reached the bottom steps, Ruth poked me and said to her daddy, "We
came to ask if you need any help."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, yes," I chimed in. "We could turn the ice cream crank machine
or sweep the floor."</TE>
<TE>   "You can't fool me, girls." Mr. Burt laughed and gave us some
gumdrops.</TE>
<TE>   Then he told us to run along.</TE>
<TE>   "Can we see what you're doing?" Ruth asked.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Burt paused and finally said, "OK. But it's a big secret."</TE>
<TE>   "You must promise not to tell anyone," added Harry.</TE>
<TE>   "We promise," Ruth and I said together.</TE>
<TE>   "We're experimenting with ice cream and candy," Mr. Burt said.</TE>
<TE>   "All our customers like chocolate candy, and they all like ice
cream," said Harry. "We're trying to make something special that
combines them both."</TE>
<TE>   "But we are not having an easy time of it," Mr. Burt said.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: Will their experiment work?</TE>
<TE>   This story, by Nancy Smiler Levinson, is based on the true account
of the history of the Good Humor ice cream bar, a chapter in a book
on the social history of ice cream, "We All Scream for Ice Cream!" by
Lee Wardlaw, HarperCollins 2000. Levinson's story will be on The
Times Web site at www.latimes.comkids.</TE>

<HD>Early On, It Was Quite a Show</HD>
<DH>Summer Jam mixed a strong lineup of hip-hop veterans,
highlighted by Snoop Dogg, with R&amp;B newcomers such as Truth Hurts and
Tweet before the event was shut down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BALTIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Until the violent outburst that ended the concert Sunday at Verizon
Wireless Amphitheater, Summer Jam was a celebration of the strong
creative and commercial state of R&amp;B and hip-hop these days. The
show's opening act, Amerie, is coming off a Top 10 debut on the
Billboard album chart with her "All I Have."</LD>
<LD>   The lineup, which ranged from hot R&amp;B newcomers such as Avant and
Tweet to established hip-hop icons Snoop Dogg and LL Cool J, was as
impressive as any concert venture in Southern California this summer
and avoided the lulls of most daylong radio station shows.</LD>
<LD>   In only three songs, Atlanta native Tweet, backed by an
eight-piece band that included three female vocalists, displayed an
appealing stage presence and the shy, yet sultry personality that
permeates her debut album, "Southern Hummingbird."</LD>
<TE>   Of the divas though, none shone more than Truth Hurts, the Dr. Dre
discovery who just released her first CD, "Truthfully Speaking."
Dressed in white shorts, white boots and a white blouse, Truth Hurts
combined a commanding persona with a playful side that won over the
crowd, particularly the ladies.</TE>
<TE>   She delivered a half-hour set that proudly displayed old-school
influences. If the songs, save for the single "Addictive," which
featured a guest appearance by rapper Rakim, didn't have the same
forcefulness, her banter and stage command made an impression.</TE>
<TE>   On the hip-hop side, the show was, of course, incomplete, as the
two hot young guns, Ja Rule and Nelly, never took the stage.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans rapper Mystikal, notable for his gruff vocal delivery,
proved to be a crowd favorite during his 45-minute stint but it was
an old lion that roared loudest.</TE>
<TE>   Playing early in the afternoon, Snoop Dogg turned in a masterly
45-minute set. Drawing on classics such as "Gin and Juice" and new
material, Snoop reminded just how fluid and effortless he makes his
sing-song rhymes. He also appeared very spry, clad in gray sweat
shorts and a gray tank top, dancing around on stage.</TE>
<TE>   It's the type of memory that people should've left Summer Jam with
instead of the violence by a few that left the day incomplete for the
many.</TE>

<KH>The Big Picture PATRICK GOLDSTEIN</KH>
<HD>The Real Deal</HD>
<DH>Nikki Reed meant to write a teen comedy but came up with
something truer</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK GOLDSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nikki Reed and Evan Rachel Wood, the teen stars of the movie
"Thirteen," are sprawled one atop the other, playing a scene in which
they make out on the floor of a bedroom decorated with pictures of
Christina Ricci. After sharing a swig of beer--actually a prop bottle
filled with water--they experiment with several seductive kisses,
their willowy bodies a tangle of braided hair and bellybutton rings.</LD>
<LD>   After the first take, cinematographer Elliot Davis stops the
action to adjust the stream of light shining on the bedroom wall.
"What are you worried about?" asks Reed, tugging on her tank top.
"While we're making out, you think people are going to be going,
'Look at that wall; it's not properly lit?' "</LD>
<LD>   It was only eight months ago that Reed, then 13, sat down with a
friend to try to write the kind of movie Hollywood thrives on, a dumb
teen comedy. But something unexpected happened. When Reed, now a
14-year-old student entering ninth grade in Culver City, began
dredging up stories from her own life, the dumb teen comedy became a
harrowing drama about a young L.A. girl who grows up too fast and
finds her life spiraling out of control, fueled by a volatile
combination of rebellion, anger and a fascination with sex, material
goods, self-mutilation and drugs.</LD>
<TE>   As Reed puts it: "All this stuff came out and, call it what you
like, it wasn't a dumb teen comedy."</TE>
<TE>   Now something even more unexpected has happened: The movie is
being made. Reed and Wood, the younger daughter in the TV drama "Once
and Again," have the leading roles, along with Holly Hunter, who
plays a character based on Reed's single mother. Called "Thirteen,"
the movie has been filming in Los Angeles for the last month,
directed by Catherine Hardwicke, a respected production designer
("Vanilla Sky" and "Three Kings"). Reed co-wrote the film with
Hardwicke, whom Reed has known since she was a toddler.</TE>
<TE>   Teen confessional books are suddenly hot properties, at least on
the cutting edge of the movie business. According to Variety, Radar
Pictures recently bought "Twelve," a grim portrait of drugs and
decadence among upper-crust New York teens by 18-year-old wunderkind
Nick McDonell. "XXX" co-star Asia Argento plans to direct and star in
an adaptation of 22-year-old writer J.T. LeRoy's "The Heart Is
Deceitful Above All Things," a series of stories about drug abuse and
prostitution. And Miramax is developing "Teen Angst? Naah ...," a
nonfiction account of teen life by Hunter College student Ned
Vizzini.</TE>
<TE>   It's doubtful that any of these projects, if made, will ever match
the business "Scream" did in its opening weekend. The Hollywood teen
movies that turn a profit are usually heart-tugging romances like
"Save the Last Dance" or outrageous fantasies about the rituals of
young boys and sex, focusing either on their efforts to lose their
virginity ("American Pie") or help a girl lose hers ("Cruel
Intentions").</TE>
<TE>   The films that have dealt realistically with teen angst, including
"Election," "Crazy/Beautiful," "The Virgin Suicides" and "Ghost
World," have been box-office underachievers. Going through
adolescence is tough enough; when teens go to the movies, they seem
to prefer seeing an idealized version of themselves.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the major studios had little interest in "Thirteen,"
which relentlessly de-glamorizes the teen experience. Michael London,
one of the film's producers, says the script is so unflinching that
it scared most of the people who read it. The film's original
financing came from equity investors assembled by producer Jeffrey
Levy-Hinte; Working Title Films came up with additional funding just
before shooting started.</TE>
<TE>   With a budget of less than $2 million, everyone has scrambled to
make ends meet. Davis has shot the film in Super 16, allowing him to
film everything with a hand-held camera and work without
time-consuming lighting setups. Hardwicke recruited friends to work
on the film and has furnished most of her own locations.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost everything you see here is from my house. We took a truck
over and emptied out all the furniture," says Hardwicke, who has a
South Texas twang and wears a tiny white bird clip in her hair. "The
actors have all worn my clothes at one time or another, and last week
we used my Jeep as the camera car. When we needed to do a dolly shot,
Elliot grabbed a shopping cart he saw at the side of the road."</TE>
<TE>   Time is always short, especially since child labor regulations
limit the 14-year-olds to seven-hour shooting days. A child welfare
officer is on set to enforce the time restrictions as well as to
arbitrate decency issues.</TE>
<TE>   The officer, Honore Sato, is ever alert. When a suspiciously sweet
cloud of smoke wafts over our head one day, she dryly explains,
"Don't worry, that's an herbal cigarette, not pot." Because of the
explicitness of the script, there are a lot of challenges, especially
involving a scene in which the girls, armed with a bong pipe, try to
seduce their 24-year-old neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   "The bong is OK as long as the girls aren't actually smoking it,"
explains Sato. "With the seduction scene, the big issue is touching.
The girls can take the guy's pants off, but they couldn't touch his
zipper or crotch or his nipples."</TE>
<TE>   Sex is an integral part of "Thirteen," in part because it
illustrates Reed's rocky journey into adolescence, in part because it
reflects the way teens absorb our culture's barrage of seductive
messages. When one of the girls in the film is asked if she knows how
to kiss a girl, she responds with jaded cool, "Of course I do. I
practiced along with 'Cruel Intentions,' like, 50 times."</TE>
<TE>   One day, Hardwicke points out a skimpy yellow thong hanging on the
wall in Reed's character's bedroom. The thong is emblazoned with the
slogan: "Slippery When Wet." "It's not something we made; we bought
this at a store," says Hardwicke. "And then we wonder why girls are
always thinking about sex? Well, look at the messages we send them.
We pump all this body consciousness into their heads and then act
surprised when they lose their innocence."</TE>
<TE>   Hardwicke and Reed became close after Reed's parents split up and
Hardwicke was dating her father, Seth Reed, a Hollywood art director.
Nikki would stay with her dad every other weekend and bonded with
Hardwicke, who taught Nikki's older brother how to surf and remained
friendly with Nikki after Hardwicke and her father broke up.</TE>
<TE>   "Catherine wasn't step-mom material," Nikki Reed explains while
taking a break from filming. "She was more like your crazy, fun older
sister. I liked her because she had a lot of goals and was someone I
could talk to."</TE>
<TE>   Hardwicke took Reed to museums and got her interested in
photography. But when she returned from a movie shoot a couple of
years ago, she noticed that the onetime honors student was sullen,
argumentative and uninterested in school.</TE>
<TE>   "I was lost," Reed says. "I was really unhappy with who I was.
There were lots of times when I'd wake up and just want to die. I
guess it's part of being a teenager that you always want to be
somebody else. I started hanging out with these bad girls because at
least I felt I belonged, even if it really wasn't the right place."</TE>
<TE>   Eager for Nikki to have a creative outlet, Hardwicke got her
interested in acting, which led to the idea of writing a script
together. Reed found a new group of friends, started getting A's in
school again and somehow turned a corner. "Who knows what changed?"
she says. "Maybe you can only be depressed so long. I just woke up
and it was a new day"</TE>
<TE>   Reed says "Thirteen" is largely autobiographical, though as she
puts it, "some things are more extreme. But the main events really
happened." In the movie, Wood plays Tracy, the character based on
Nikki; Reed plays Evie, her seductively cool new friend and a
composite of the bad girls Nikki knew in real life.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of me wanted to play myself," she says. "But I keep telling
myself. 'You've already gone through it. Why should you have to do it
again?' "</TE>
<TE>   Reed's mom, Cheryl Houston, says she embraced the idea of Nikki
chronicling the unhappiest chapter of her life. "I told her to write
from the heart," she explains. Houston is on the set each day but
keeps a low profile. "Nikki will tell me what they're shooting and
whether it's OK for me to be around," says Houston, who works at home
as a hairdresser. "And let me tell you, when she did the scene where
she gave the next-door neighbor a lap dance, that was definitely a
mom's not-to-be-around day."</TE>
<TE>   Reed still acts like a typical teenager, shooing her mother away
when she wants some privacy. But she's appreciative of her mother's
trust. "She's been great," says Reed. "She didn't ask me to take
anything out. And that's what makes this movie what it is--the stuff
we didn't take out."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After getting snarled in record company red tape seven years ago,
Siouxsie and the Banshees suffered a creative collapse.</LD>
<LD>   Though lead singer Siouxsie Sioux and drummer-husband Budgie
continued to make music, most notably in one of their previous
incarnations as the Creatures, it was the mournful mysticism of the
Banshees that the goth goddess' loyal black-clad legions continued to
crave.</LD>
<LD>   This year the band reunited with Banshees bassist Steve Severin
for the "Seven Year Itch Tour" and, after a few shows around the
globe, including a stop at April's Coachella Arts and Music Festival,
the band made a triumphant return Sunday at the Hollywood Palladium.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike the Coachella show, where Sioux received mixed reviews for
largely ignoring Banshee hits and being somewhat disconnected with
fans, Sunday's performance was full of ecstatic interaction and
fervently rendered favorites.</TE>
<TE>   While the Banshees' music is characterized by dark, often languid
melodies and gloomy atmospherics, it never felt like a cliche. A
svelte and seemingly ageless Sioux was gleeful and radiant on Sunday,
kneeling on the edge of the stage to meld with the crowd as she laid
her sultry, signature croon on hits such as "Christine" and "Cities
in Dust."</TE>
<TE>   The band didn't reveal any new material, but its rapturous set
proved that its range and exotic take on the gothic genre remain
bewitching.</TE>

<LD>THEATER</LD>
<LD>   Lining Up to See 'The Producers'</LD>
<LD>   The L.A. production of "The Producers," which doesn't open until
next May, grossed $2 million in single ticket sales in the first week
since the box office opened Aug. 5. That contributed to a total of
$11 million in advance ticket sales for the production at the
Pantages Theatre, which will star Martin Short and Jason Alexander.</LD>
<TE>   The sales breakdown so far, said producer Richard Frankel, also
includes $4 million to Broadway/L.A. and Center Theatre Group
subscribers, $4 million in group sales, and $1 million via an
American Express promotion.</TE>
<TE>   About $300,000 of the sales are for premium-priced tickets
available through Broadway Inner Circle, the organization that raised
eyebrows last year for charging $480 for tickets to the New York
production of "Producers." In L.A., the Broadway Inner Circle tickets
cost $180 or $300. The big spenders get seats in the center of the
orchestra section, adjacent parking, a private entrance, souvenir
programs and--at the higher price--access to a private bar before the
show and during intermission.</TE>

<TE>   Another Dispute in Aaliyah Death</TE>
<TE>   The director of a Bahamian funeral home has charged that Virgin
Records--a division of music giant EMI--has reneged on an agreement
to pay for preparing and transporting the bodies of R&amp;B singer
Aaliyah and her entourage after their plane crashed last summer in
the Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   Loretta Turrier, of Butler's Funder Homes and Crematorium in
Nassau, said in this week's issue of Time magazine that she is out
$68,000 and has appealed for help to the American Embassy.</TE>
<TE>   "Virgin has indicated to us that they will not honor the
agreement. We worked 24/7 to get the bodies out as expeditiously as
possible. We had to bring in extra staff. People worked on their day
off," she said, but there has not been "one word of thanks to
anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Spragg, an attorney representing Aaliyah's parents in a
lawsuit against Virgin and others, had a similar experience. Virgin
executives told him that they'd be responsible for funeral expenses,
he told the magazine, but so far, they've received nothing. The
executives who allegedly made the promises--former EMI chief Ken
Berry and his wife, former Virgin vice president Nancy Berry, have
since been dismissed from the company.</TE>
<TE>   Until she's paid, Turner says, she plans to withhold the nine
official death certificates. The papers are needed for the lawsuits
to proceed and Aaliyah's estate to be settled.</TE>
<TE>   "The accident was a terrible tragedy," said Jeanne Meyer, senior
vice president of corporate communications for EMI Recorded Music.
"Unfortunately, because of pending litigation, we cannot comment
further."</TE>
<TE>   Mobile Graceland Tour in the Works</TE>
<TE>   Elvis Presley Enterprises has plans for a "Mobile Graceland" tour,
bringing the singer's Army jacket, a letter from President Nixon, a
comb and other memorabilia to 31 cities.</TE>
<TE>   The 53-foot truck will be in Memphis on Friday to mark the 25th
anniversary of Presley's death. Among the dates: New York's Times
Square (Sept. 24), Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (Sept. 28),
and a San Diego Chargers game (Nov. 17).</TE>
<TE>   The tour, co-sponsored by the Harrah's Entertainment Inc. casino
company and FYE record stores, will be featured primarily in mall
parking lots and in casinos owned by Harrah's.</TE>
<TE>   "We have more artifacts than we have the space or time to display
at Graceland," said Jennifer Burgess, director of marketing for Elvis
Presley Enterprises. "It grew out of the desire to share the Elvis
experience with all those people who can't make it to Memphis for one
reason or another."</TE>
<TE>   Graceland itself is said to attract more than 650,000 visitors a
year.</TE>

<HD>A Setback for Live Hip-Hop</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* A melee forces evacuation of Summer Jam, the
latest concert to be troubled by audience violence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lasting memory of Summer Jam 2002 will be its chaotic, early
ending on Sunday--there were 30 arrests and three people injured when
fights broke out at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater concert--and
the addition of the show to the list of troubled hip-hop events.</LD>
<LD>   The all-day affair organized by radio station the Beat (KKBT-FM,
100.3) was cut short about 7:30 p.m., before big-name acts such as
Nelly, Ja Rule and Ashanti ever reached the stage, and the venue was
evacuated by Irvine police. Veteran rapper LL Cool J was performing
when audience members rushed the stage and chairs began flying at
security staffers.</LD>
<LD>   "Security lost control of the stage," Irvine police Lt. Sam
Allevato said Monday. "Those [audience members] dressed in gang
attire began hitting audience members who had come on stage with
metal pipes." Three patrons reported injuries; one was hospitalized
and released.</LD>
<TE>   Rap concerts have long been dogged by a reputation for safety
problems, although in recent years the genre has shown the ability to
mount large, successful road shows such as the trouble-free Smokin'
Grooves tours.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had problems before at this concert because of the nature
of the groups involved and the past history of the performers," said
Allevato, who added that another Summer Jam was stopped in the
mid-1990s. The same venue, though, has seen similar disturbances at
Jimmy Buffett and Grateful Dead shows, Allevato noted.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Leichter, general manager of the Beat, issued this
statement: "We've had a peaceful event every year for the past nine
years. It is sad that a few unruly people were intent on ruining the
day for 16,000 people who wanted to enjoy the event. We were very
happy that the Irvine Police Department handled the incident quickly
and professionally."</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear Monday how the future of Summer Jam might be
affected by the violence. Irvine police were already concerned about
the show; they had requested extra staffing for the Sunday concert,
and promoters responded by paying for 35 police officers from Irvine
and 40 more officers were pulled in from gang task force units of
other agencies. Once the melee started, 42 more officers from seven
other agencies responded.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure we'll be looking at expenditures and talking to
management at Verizon to make sure this doesn't happen again,"
Allevato said.</TE>

<HD>Updated and Revised, He's Still a 'Good Man'</HD>
<DH>Charlie Brown and the rest of Schulz's gang benefit from
strong performances in Colony Theatre's heartfelt version.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID C. NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The enduring wisdom of Charles M. Schulz inhabits the 1999 Broadway
revision of Clark Gesner's "You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,"
receiving its local premiere as the second offering of the Colony
Theatre's inaugural Equity season. Though cynics may scoff, this
revue-styled celebration of the "Peanuts" gang is exceptionally
appointed and performed and is generally delightful.</LD>
<LD>   This is particularly notable because in New York, despite Rosie
O'Donnell's tireless promotional efforts, Michael Mayer and Andrew
Lippa's updating folded after 150 performances, even though it
garnered Tony Awards for actors Kristin Chenoweth and Roger Bart.</LD>
<LD>   For many, the political corrections and brassy Broadway pop
arrangements distorted the intimate charm of Gesner's 1967 original,
whose off-Broadway incarnation ran for 1,597 performances, spawning
countless regional and amateur productions worldwide. Was an update
really necessary?</LD>
<TE>   Maybe not, but here, under director-choreographer Todd Nielsen's
excellent guidance, it seems a persuasive alternative. The
reconstituted title number demonstrates as much, intercutting spoken
observations about its subject (the wonderful Ed F. Martin) with an
expanded post-Stephen Sondheim musical attack (effectively overseen,
as is the whole score, by musical director Tom Griffin).</TE>
<TE>   Though nontraditional, the approach deftly establishes the
archetypal characters' adult viewpoints in children's guise.</TE>
<TE>   There is Beethoven-worshiping Schroeder (the golden-voiced Roger
Befeler), eternally at odds with contemporary clamor. There are the
Van Pelt siblings: philosophical blanket fetishist Linus (Rod Keller,
ideal) and titanic fussbudget Lucy (the prodigious Julie Dixon
Jackson). Sidekick Patty is now Charlie's sister Sally Brown (Beth
Malone, hysterical), while Snoopy (the proficient Nick DeGruccio)
remains the same crowd-pleasing humanoid canine of yore.</TE>
<TE>   For the next two hours, which usually fly higher than the hero's
recalcitrant kite, they cavort with unaffected spontaneity that
easily compensates for the occasional incongruities of tone between
old and new elements.</TE>
<TE>   The crackerjack design scheme is anchored by Bradley Kaye's superb
set, simultaneously abstracting and replicating Schulz's
idiosyncratic style. Lisa D. Katz's lighting, Drew Dalzell's sound
and Scott A. Lane's costumes are all seamlessly coordinated, with
many inventive surprises.</TE>
<TE>   Nielsen has a field day with the staging, from the Paul Taylor
handling of Keller's agile "My Blanket and Me" to the inspired
insertion of "Rabbit Chasing" into the Act 1 closer, "The Book
Report."</TE>
<TE>   He can't help Lippa's "Beethoven Day," which, while affording
Befeler's chops a nifty showcase, seems unrelated to the whole. Nor
does the jazz-gospel take on "Suppertime" cover DeGruccio's valiant
struggle with tessitura, and the script's omission of Sally's
infatuation with Linus is a missed opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   But when Martin voices his Everyman's complaints in priceless
milquetoast manner and Jackson belts her high notes clear across town
and Malone sells the kicky "My New Philosophy" with equal parts Judy
Holliday and Baby June, reservations evaporate.</TE>
<TE>   And if you can witness the unforced simplicity of the pajama-clad
finale "Happiness" without your eyes moistening, you've regrettably
missed the point this enchantingly heartfelt production so
disarmingly delivers.</TE>

<HD>Studio Glamour in Early Hollywood</HD>
<DH>Ruth Harriet Louise, an MGM photographer, helped create
stars as silents gave way to talkies</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Art historians have a tough job. To find work in an increasingly
competitive market, they have two options: Come up with an original
interpretation of art their peers are familiar with, or discover
someone who has been overlooked by the art-history industry.</LD>
<LD>   The latter is easier, but it's still fraught with difficulty. More
often than not, historians who focus on the work of an unknown artist
exaggerate its significance.</LD>
<LD>   At the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, a fine but far from
groundbreaking exhibition presents 80 of the 100,000 photographs Ruth
Harriet Louise made between 1925 and 1929, when she ran the portrait
division of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's publicity department. Organized by
art historian and curator Bruce Robertson and private dealer Robert
Dance (whose specialty is Old Master paintings and drawings), "Ruth
Harriet Louise and Hollywood Glamour Photography" fleshes out the
historical record by inviting viewers to travel back to a time when
silent movies gave way to talkies, and a handful of powerful studios
squeezed out most of the small companies that had made up the movie
industry.</LD>
<TE>   As a body of work, Louise's 14-inch-by-11-inch silver prints are
sensitive, intelligent and warm. Some are silly--almost campy in the
way their sitters strike poses and go through the motions of being
spontaneous. In one, the young photographer's cousin, Carmel Myers,
preens like a peacock in a jewel-encrusted costume designed by Erte
for her role in "Ben-Hur." A family friend of studio chief Louis B.
Mayer, she probably helped Louise get her job at MGM.</TE>
<TE>   Four pictures of Patricia Avery (whose career never took off)
depict her as a coquettish Easter bunny, a nun lost in prayer, a
breast-clutching heartthrob and an elegant sophisticate. Two shots of
Dorothy Sebastian (a contract player who made six movies a year
between 1925 and 1932), shows her wearing only the bottom half of a
French maid's outfit but still looking like nobody's fool.</TE>
<TE>   Other prints are touching, especially Louise's portraits of
17-year-old Nina Mae McKinney and 15-year-old Loretta Young, whose
fresh-faced earnestness she captures with seemingly effortless
directness. In contrast, Mary Doran, who played small roles for three
years, looks like she's trying too hard to succeed. A pair of
half-length portraits of Mae Murray suggests that she's got so much
going on in her head that no picture could reveal more than a
fleeting facet of her tightly wound complexity.</TE>
<TE>   Louise's best photographs are riveting in their capacity to
capture that intangible magic that makes a star shine. Her 12
portraits of Greta Garbo steal the show. Although it's hard to
imagine a picture of the Swedish star you wouldn't want to look at,
Louise excelled at getting extraneous props and poses out of the way
so that her aura could glow.</TE>
<TE>   The 12 prints date from September 1925, when Garbo arrived in
Hollywood as a 19-year-old uncomfortable with her English, to
November 1928, when she was filming "Wild Orchids" and refused to do
more than one short photo session. The sequence chronicles both
Garbo's transformation into a mythical screen presence and Louise's
development into a photographer able to keep her works simple,
forthright and potent.</TE>
<TE>   A second highlight of the exhibition is a group of 14 portraits of
Joan Crawford. They show the down-to-earth girl from Texas prancing
like a cheerleader, dressed as Mrs. Santa Claus and paired with such
leading men as Johnny Mack Brown and Robert Montgomery. She also
models fur coats, dons a shiny hood and, as if posing for the cover
of a harlequin romance, holds a handkerchief to her lips as tears
well up in her eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Louise photographed Crawford more than any other actor, even
taking her equipment to the star's home in Brentwood, where she posed
in the garden with her husband, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Unlike Garbo,
who brings a sense of inexhaustible mystery to even the simplest
picture, Crawford pours everything she's got into every photograph.
She embodies the same hard-working ethos Louise brought to the job.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly revealing portraits of Marion Davies, Norma Shearer,
Lillian Gish and Marie Dressler round out the firmament, in terms of
women. Louise's photographs of men, which account for less than 20%
of the works in the show, include Ramon Navarro, John Gilbert, Ralph
Forbes, William Haines, Buster Keaton and Lon Chaney. They lack the
intimacy of her pictures of women.</TE>
<TE>   By today's standards, Louise's black-and-white portraits seem
almost quaint. Although she was paid handsomely to make images that
greased the wheels of the studio machinery, her pictures are
surprisingly humane--not quite up-close-and-personal, but a lot more
approachable than the slick, over-processed counterparts that have
taken their place.</TE>
<TE>   Many of Louise's prints manage to convey a feeling of
vulnerability, which probably had as much to do with her position at
the newly formed studio as it did with the movie industry's
uncertainty about its own power to shape the taste of a rapidly
expanding audience. By December 1929, such tentativeness was gone.</TE>
<TE>   MGM did not renew Louise's contract, hiring George Hurrell
instead. His brazenly seductive photographs, which required loads of
retouching and long hours in the darkroom, replaced the smoldering
sensuality of her portraits with a sort of go-for-the-throat sex
appeal that is commonplace today.</TE>
<TE>   If not for the care and consideration Louise brought to her job,
her photographs would not document as much as they do. Nor would they
possess the sense of journeyman integrity and comfortable, one-on-one
intimacy that marks them as her own. Still, she was neither a great
talent nor a particularly inspired innovator.</TE>
<TE>   It's disingenuous for the curators to claim, as they do in the
informative catalog, that Louise was one of the most influential
photographers of the 20th century. She was in the right place at the
right time. And she did the right thing: create an impressive
inventory of images. Her oeuvre is nothing more, and nothing less,
than a time capsule, a terrifically detailed picture of a fascinating
era.</TE>

<HD>In 'Books,' Charlip Expresses Himself</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Remy Charlip's biography lists achievements as modern dancer,
choreographer, stage director, set designer, plus a separate career
as children's book author and illustrator.</LD>
<LD>   A sense of serious whimsy links many of these pursuits and it
loomed large on Sunday in the San Francisco-based Charlip's
retrospective program "Books Into Theater, Theater Into Books" at the
Mark Taper Auditorium of the L.A. Central Library downtown.</LD>
<LD>   Born in 1929, Charlip danced for Postmodern precursor Merce
Cunningham in the 1950s. But his own choreography has often included
as many facial expressions as steps because, as he explained Sunday,
"with Merce, we never used our faces."</LD>
<TE>   The suite "Seven Short Songs" emphasized wry gestural commentary,
artful body-sculpture and bittersweet reminiscences, with Charlip
adapting Irving Berlin's "It Only Happens When I Dance With You" to
express his need to love and accept himself.</TE>
<TE>   First danced in 1966, his mercurial "Meditation" solo (to
Massenet) displayed his mastery of pantomime, with forceful gestures
melting into passive anguish and accusatory finger-pointing yielding
to fearful trembling. However, upward reaching dominated the piece;
Charlip is not someone who stays hopeless for long.</TE>
<TE>   A videotape of Toby Armour in "Dance in a Bed" provided a sampling
of Charlip's innovative "Air Mail Dances," for which he would draw a
series of positions, mailing them to the performer. That performer
would then complete the dance by creating transitions between the
positions.</TE>
<TE>   Shot from above, and using the same Saint-Saens score familiar
from "The Dying Swan," Armour's version featured restless stretches,
twists and splits: everyone's nighttime tossing and turning
heightened and refined into a dance with plenty of movement but no
steps.</TE>
<TE>   Charlip appeared amid giant household objects in a videotape of
"Glow Worm," acting out the song lyrics and his memories of childhood
in sign language but periodically letting the movement carry him into
darker emotions.</TE>
<TE>   Slides of Charlip's picture books, and a discussion of how these
works turned into stage vehicles for his children's theater group,
the Paper Bag Players (started in the late '50s in New York),
completed a presentation rich in insight, feeling and high
proficiency.</TE>

<HD>A 'Peanuts' Gang Clubhouse</HD>
<DH>It's a museum, Charlie Brown, and it's devoted to the work
of the late syndicated cartoonist Charles M. Schulz.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES SOLOMON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SANTA ROSA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The Charles M. Schulz Museum and Research Center, which opens
Saturday as the first museum in America devoted to the work of an
individual cartoonist, is a handsome but unassuming building that
fits quietly into its residential neighborhood here.</LD>
<LD>   That modesty seems appropriate. Although he created a worldwide
popular culture and marketing phenomenon, Schulz remained a modest
man who once said, "Cartooning is a fairly sort of a proposition. You
have to be fairly intelligent--if you were really intelligent you'd
be doing something else. You have to draw fairly well--if you drew
really well you'd be a painter. You have to write fairly well--if you
wrote really well you'd be writing books. It's great for a fairly
person like me."</LD>
<LD>   He may have seen himself as a "fairly person," but Schulz drew the
most popular strip in the history of newspaper comics. By 1999,
"Peanuts" was syndicated in more than 2,600 newspapers worldwide,
with an estimated readership of more than 350 million. More than 300
million "Peanuts" books have been sold, and license products account
for an estimated $1 billion per year.</LD>
<TE>   Two years after his death, reprints of old strips continue to
appear in many newspapers, including The Times.</TE>
<TE>   The new museum stands a few blocks from Schulz's studio and the
Redwood Empire Ice Rink he built and maintained for local kids.
Designed by architect C. David Robinson, the 27,000-square-foot
stone, wood and glass museum is intended to reflect the cartoonist's
understated personality.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson, who worked with the cartoonist on the plans, says,
"Every design decision has been based on a single question: Would
Sparky [Schulz's lifelong nickname] be comfortable here? We have done
our best to suggest the playful whimsy of his cartoon world."</TE>
<TE>   The idea for the museum slowly grew out of a gallery in the gift
shop that was built next to the ice rink in 1983 to display "Peanuts"
strips, awards, artwork about Schulz's characters from other
cartoonists and so on.</TE>
<TE>   Jeannie Schulz, the cartoonist's widow, recalls, "We talked a
little bit about a museum, but Sparky didn't jump on the idea,
partially out of modesty and partially because when you're living and
working, you don't think of yourself as a subject for a museum. When
we began systematically archiving our original strips in the
mid-'90s, we realized we had a collection of nearly 7,000 strips and
that people would like to see Sparky's artwork, as it's so different
from what you see in the newspaper."</TE>
<TE>   Construction of the $8-million structure was financed by the
Schulz family through a nonprofit organization that will operate the
facility. The family expects the museum to be self-sufficient through
income from admissions, donations and merchandise sales.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to permanent and temporary galleries for original
artwork, the facility includes a 100-seat auditorium, a research
center, museum store, classroom space and several large-scale art
installations.</TE>
<TE>   The most striking of these installations is a two-story mosaic
mural by Japanese artist Yoshiteru Otani. It's composed of 3,588
"Peanuts" strips (the equivalent of more than 10 years' worth of
dailies) reproduced on 2-inch by 8-inch ceramic tiles.</TE>
<TE>   Otani arranged the tiles so the black areas in the strips form the
lines of a huge image of Charlie Brown running to kick the football
as Lucy holds it. The lines are remarkably true to the curves Schulz
drew; they're not just angular approximations.</TE>
<TE>   The same tiles are set into the walls of the bathrooms, around the
urinals, toilet stalls and sinks, low enough for children to read.</TE>
<TE>   The mural Schulz painted for his daughter Meredith's nursery in
his 1951 Colorado home has been preserved and installed in the
museum.</TE>
<TE>   A carved wooden mural, also by Otani, traces the development of
Snoopy from his initial design as a square-headed dog who walked on
four feet to his final incarnation as an upright, walking character
with a large oval head.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, a big sycamore has been transformed into a kite-eating
tree by Michael Hayden's neon kite sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose of the museum is to present Sparky's artwork and to
interpret it in as many ways as possible," says Jeannie Schulz. "We
determined before Sparky died that it should feel alive, but it
wasn't going to be a play place or a mini-Disneyland. Whether it's an
appreciation of how hard he worked, a better understanding of why
something seems funny, or whatever, I just hope people go away with a
little more understanding of Sparky's art than they had when they
came in."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to 100 or so original "Peanuts" strips, the
storyboards from the TV program "What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown"
(1983) will be on display. Schulz took particular pride in this
Peabody Award-winning special, in which his characters revisited the
site of the D-day landings.</TE>
<TE>   There are also special galleries for tribute strips from scores of
cartoonists, including Jim Borgman, Cathy Guisewite, Mell Lazarus,
Dan Piraro, Jules Feiffer, Mike Peters and Art Spiegelman.</TE>
<TE>   Schulz quietly transformed the comic strip. He introduced a
simpler, more caricatured style of drawing and shifted the humor from
brash gags to subtler situations that grew out of the characters'
personalities. He used captionless drawings and the spaces between
the panels with exceptional skill to suggest the rhythms of speech.
Virtually every comic strip from the last 50 years has been
influenced by his work.</TE>
<TE>   "For Better or For Worse" creator Lynn Johnston summed up the
opinion within the comic strip community: "Charles 'Sparky' Schulz
had the courage to talk about loneliness and loss, about
disappointment and anger, and he did it in a way that worked. In
doing so, he profoundly influenced a new generation of comic artists
and readers as well. It was rebellion in reverse; impact with
understatement and honesty that healed even when it hurt.... His is
the example that set the bar for all of us."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Schulz Museum is a first in the United States,
numerous museums have held "Peanuts" exhibits, including the
Smithsonian Institute and the Louvre.</TE>
<TE>   Schulz had ambivalent feelings about the relationship between
comic strips and the traditional fine arts, which he discussed in a
1987 interview: "I think this comic strip is better than a lot of
things around that they call art, but I don't think it's as good as
anything Picasso ever did," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I also don't think Picasso could have drawn a comic strip. This
is a very demanding profession, but I'm not sure it is art, and I'm
not sure it really even matters. The same way as is tap-dancing as
good as ballet dancing--who cares? Those discussions baffle me."</TE>

<CX>   Cartoonist's museum--An Aug. 13 Calendar story mistakenly called the
Charles M. Schulz Museum and Research Center in Santa Rosa the first
museum in America devoted to the work of an individual cartoonist. A
Chester Gould museum, paying tribute to the creator of Dick Tracy,
has been operating in Woodstock, Ill., since 1991.</CX>

<HD>Britain Is Trying to Draw Up Plans for Its Next Pop
Invasion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL SUTCLIFFE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Yes, Eurythmics,
Culture Club: What do they all have in common? They're British and
they all topped the American charts, mid-'60s to mid-'80s, mop-top
pop to camp new romanticism.</LD>
<LD>   After 10 lean years in the U.S., the industry here is proposing
extraordinary measures to restore its stateside standing.
Essentially, by early next year it wants to establish a rock and pop
embassy-cum-trade mission in New York to be called the United Kingdom
Music Office.</LD>
<LD>   This recommendation is the keystone of a report--"Make or Break:
Supporting U.K. Music in the USA"--that hammers home some bleak
statistics. On market share measured by rankings in Billboard's Top
100 album chart, U.K. artists scored 18% of the action in 1965 (beat
boom bands), 26% in 1972 (the prog and heavy rock era) and a whopping
high of 32% in 1986 (glam pop, abetted by Dire Straits, in the early
days of MTV, when British videos ruled).</LD>
<TE>   The last decade, however, saw the Brits hit the skids, bottoming
out in 1999 with 2% of the market, provided in its entirety by the
Prodigy's "Fat of the Land" collection.</TE>
<TE>   "What that figure tells us is we can't be too proud anymore," says
Paul Brindley, the report's co-author.</TE>
<TE>   Brindley was the bass player with the Sundays, a pop-rock group
that had two gold albums in the U.S. in the early '90s; he later
became a researcher, working in Tony Blair's office before Blair was
elected prime minister in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   His fellow author is music industry veteran Doug D'Arcy, who
started out as Jethro Tull's road manager on a North American tour in
1969 and went on to run Chrysalis Records (Ten Years After, Procol
Harum), then the Dedicated label (Spiritualized) until its demise in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   Together they sifted fact and opinion to analyze what had gone
wrong. The only argument they couldn't countenance, says D'Arcy, was
"It's the music, stupid!" because defeatism was not part of their
agenda.</TE>
<TE>   So "Make or Break" traced the topography of decline. Among its
salient features:</TE>
<TE>   * The damage done around the turn of the '90s by the absorption of
lively and powerful mid-size U.K. independent record companies
Virgin, Island and Chrysalis by major labels.</TE>
<TE>   * The tendency for ever-fewer U.K. labels and artist managers to
maintain offices in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   * The mysterious cultural chemistry that decreed that British
artists could neither copy nor creatively reinterpret rap and its
metal sub-genres at the same time that the U.S. saw nothing in U.K.
dance music, although it was rooted in hip-hop.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps defensively, some believe that U.K. music doesn't need the
U.S. After all, Robbie Williams sold 6 million copies of his last
album, "Swing While You're Winning," without releasing it in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   But Brindley and D'Arcy reckon that 40% of the world market can
hardly be ignored. And radio DJ Nic Harcourt, an Englishman at Santa
Monica's KCRW-FM (89.9) who contributed to the report, says there are
emotional considerations too.</TE>
<TE>   "We like to do well in America. It validates who we are," he says.
"When, say, David Gray breaks and sells a couple of million records
here, I think, 'Bloody good for you, mate.' "</TE>
<TE>   Harcourt is one of many, Anglo and American, who lay some blame
for recent British failure at the door of Oasis. "They blew it for
themselves and they blew it for bands who followed them," he says.
"The laddish thing worked for them in England, but over here, once
they started behaving like [jerks], that was it."</TE>
<TE>   Although unwilling to finger individuals, D'Arcy agrees there has
been an "attitude problem."</TE>
<TE>   "We always think we're cutting-edge," he says. "But our artists
have to stop trying to convince Americans that if they don't get it,
they're stupid. We need a period of being as wide-eyed and innocent
as we were in the '60s. We need to be more modest and more
determined."</TE>
<TE>   Still, says Brindley, "I don't think the U.K. Music Office will be
there to lecture nasty rock stars on how to behave."</TE>
<TE>   More practicably, the "Make or Break" report proposes that the
music office provide advice on taxes, legal matters, insurance,
visas, copyright, licensing and distributing records, marketing, the
ins and outs of touring, promotion, etc., as well as collective deals
that could give low-budget acts and their connections access to
crucial information, including Broadcast Data Systems radio play and
Nielsen SoundScan retail sales surveys.</TE>
<TE>   If D'Arcy, Brindley and their colleagues on the steering group
responsible for translating the report into action can pull it off,
the music office will have a $1.5-million budget--financed by
industry and government grants and augmented by user
subscriptions--and three staff members, including a high-profile
director whom they hope to appoint this fall for an initial three
years.</TE>
<TE>   Then, maybe, the slight post-'99 recovery stirred by the
unanimously well-mannered Dido, David Gray, Craig David and Coldplay
can be consolidated.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Edge, who worked closely with Dido during the recording of
the singer's hit album "No Angel" and is now a vice president at New
York-based J Records and an Englishman who has worked in America for
many years, is optimistic that the "music embassy" will prove
effective: "Knowledge of the American marketplace is vital, and
someone who can connect you to the right people, give you a bit of a
road map, is going to be very useful."</TE>
<TE>   His colleague Peter Leak, Dido's manager, transplanted from U.K.
to L.A. a decade ago, hopes the venture will encourage more British
labels and managements to set up American offices.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be here a lot of the time," he stresses. "You need a
constant connection or you will be forgotten."</TE>
<TE>   Asked what standing the music office project might achieve in its
first three years, D'Arcy says, "I'd like people to be telling us,
'You were so damn lucky to start that office at the very moment when
the resurgence of British music in America began.' "</TE>
<TE>   Adds Brindley, "We don't see it as a cure-all, but we want
American record company chief execs to know who the director is when
he knocks on their door."</TE>
<TE>   It might just work. So long as the pop ambassador doesn't expect
to be called "Your Excellency."</TE>

<HD>Animal Planet Goes to the Dog</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Animal Planet is branching out into the sitcom business with, yep, a
dog.</LD>
<LD>   This may be a novel programming idea for the network, but "Beware
of Dog," which premieres today at 5 p.m. with back-to-back episodes
(repeating at 8 p.m.), plays like a patchwork of comedy cliches: the
smart-aleck mutt with a sarcastic inner monologue, the bickering
brother and sister, the New Age mom and the rigid dad.</LD>
<LD>   The first show, written by creator Rob Gilmer and directed by
Richard Martin, opens with the four-legged star, Jack, homeless and
on the prowl for a new family in front of the local grocery. Using a
move he says he borrowed from professional wrestling, Jack steps in
front of the Pooles' family car and rolls over, faking an injury.</LD>
<TE>   Naturally, Jack gets more than he bargained for in the subsequent
adoption. Upon meeting the family cat, he thinks, "I'm only passing
through, hairball." A traditional walk offends him: "I'm not into
leashes. They're post-domestication tools of oppression."</TE>
<TE>   That's about as witty as his wisecracks get, although the shaggy
Jack is undeniably cute.</TE>
<TE>   Underneath his sassy attitude and advanced vocabulary, Jack has a
soft nature he can't quite suppress.</TE>
<TE>   When the dad (Richard Waugh) forgets his wedding anniversary, Jack
slyly surfs the Internet and saves the day by ordering a dress for
the mom (Carolyn Dunn) and choosing rush delivery.</TE>
<TE>   When the son, Mark (Gage Knox), gets sick enough of his big
sister, Jessica (Alex Appel), and the rest of the household to run
away, Jack reluctantly pulls a "Lassie" and goes after him, saving
the boy moments before a bully can snatch his skateboard.</TE>
<TE>   The rescue helps bond the family, but you may think Mark had the
right idea in the first place, trying to get away.</TE>

<DH>Traffic forecast system would provide estimated travel

<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Gail Dearing, driving in Los Angeles is often a crapshoot.</LD>
<LD>   From her Eagle Rock home, the health care writer can breeze to a
meeting in West Los Angeles with few delays, or she can get caught in
nightmarish baseball traffic near Dodger Stadium that sends her
commute into extra innings.</LD>
<LD>   "My drive is different every day, so I don't know what it will be
like," she said.</LD>
<TE>   What Dearing--and the rest of Southern California--could use is a
reliable traffic forecast that estimates freeway travel times, thus
letting drivers make informed decisions on what time to start a trip
and what routes to take.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is not so farfetched.</TE>
<TE>   Some simple traffic forecast systems are already operating in
several cities, including Atlanta, Houston, San Antonio, Seattle and
Washington, D.C. Most of these systems let motorists use a computer
or telephone to get a travel-time estimate on a handful of
predetermined routes. The estimates are based on traffic conditions
collected from electronic sensors in the freeway pavement.</TE>
<TE>   Some systems are more advanced than others.</TE>
<TE>   In San Antonio, motorists can log onto an Internet system known as
Transguide, which lets drivers draw a route on a freeway map with a
few mouse clicks. The program then calculates the travel time between
the starting and ending points, assuming traffic conditions remain
stable.</TE>
<TE>   In Philadelphia, customers of Trafficpulse.com can get drive-time
estimates over the phone. Customers can simply say the name of the
freeway and the starting and ending points for the drive. A voice
recognition system converts the words into computer data, which is
used to calculate the travel time.</TE>
<TE>   So where is the high-tech traffic prognosticator for Southern
California, the nation's mecca for traffic headaches? Answer: It's
held up in a legal squabble.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic engineers at UC Berkeley have worked for four years
designing a traffic monitoring system for California. The performance
evaluation monitoring system, known as PEMS, not only would use
current conditions to estimate travel times, but also incorporate
historical freeway data from the previous six months. Think of it as
the Weather Channel for commuters.</TE>
<TE>   Motorists in Southern California and in many major cities
throughout the country already can check traffic conditions on
Internet maps that show real-time freeway speeds represented with
green for fast, yellow for slow and red for snail's pace. But PEMS
would be much more advanced because it would offer precise time
estimates for individual routes. With real-time maps, motorists can
only guess the drive time based on a bunch of colored lines.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, PEMS would know--based on historical data--that
Monday morning traffic on the Pasadena Freeway is usually light,
while a Friday afternoon around Los Angeles International Airport is
a traffic quagmire.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation experts say PEMS would be the most advanced traffic
monitoring system in the nation. That is, of course, assuming it is
put into operation.</TE>
<TE>   The system was scheduled to go online next month in Southern
California, Sacramento and the Bay Area. But it has been put on hold
because of a legal dispute over who owns the intellectual rights to a
mathematical equation used in the program. The dispute is among some
of the Berkeley engineers who designed the system.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the California Department of Transportation promise
to launch the system and make it available to the public just as soon
as the dispute is settled, which, they say, could be a few weeks or a
few months.</TE>
<TE>   Once PEMS is launched, travel times along common commuting routes
would appear on the Caltrans Web site and perhaps on those changeable
message signs installed along the shoulders of most freeways.</TE>
<TE>   How would that help you?</TE>
<TE>   You are driving on the Golden State Freeway from Santa Clarita to
work in downtown Los Angeles, and the drive-time estimate on the
lighted sign overhead says you are going to be late again. Thanks to
the computerized system, you can try to find a faster route to work
or start thinking of a good excuse for when you arrive.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, traffic forecasting systems don't make traffic
magically disappear. Still, traffic experts say the systems can help
motorists make more informed driving decisions. Many motorists have
plenty of leeway on what time to leave and what route to take. Only
20% of car trips in Southern California are taken to and from work. A
much bigger chunk of traffic is generated by trips to the market,
post office, soccer practice and other errands.</TE>
<TE>   "It allows travelers to make choices they may not otherwise make,"
said Brian Taylor, director of UCLA's Institute of Transportation
Studies. "It makes us wring more productivity out of the system."</TE>
<TE>   Here is another example of how the system can help: You are ready
to leave work in downtown Los Angeles at 6 p.m., and the traffic
forecast system predicts your drive home to Woodland Hills will take
60 minutes. But the system also predicts--based upon historical
data--that if you wait until 6:30 p.m., your drive will take only 40
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "You can then decide whether to stay at work and drink another cup
of coffee," said Pravin Varaiya, the UC Berkeley professor who
developed the system for Caltrans.</TE>
<TE>   Such travel-time estimates would be especially helpful for
motorists who are unfamiliar with the region and don't know, for
example, that the Santa Monica Freeway near the San Diego Freeway
turns into a vehicular mosh pit every day about 5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Travel-time estimates would also be helpful to someone who is in
the market for a new home. Before going into escrow, a potential home
buyer could get an estimate on the daily commute and decide whether
that extra large backyard is really worth a 90-minute drive to work
each day.</TE>
<TE>   "The potential is enormous,'' Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   These systems have one great weakness: There is no way to predict
freeway accidents, which are responsible for nearly half of all
traffic congestion in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "That is really the difficulty in predicting traffic," said Matt
Beaulieu, a transportation engineer who helps operate the traffic
monitoring system for the Washington Department of Transportation.
"There is just so much randomness."</TE>
<TE>   Varaiya said the monitoring system created for California would
recalculate traffic estimates every five minutes based on new freeway
data. If an accident suddenly turns a relatively easy freeway commute
into the road to perdition, the system can alert motorists quickly,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If an incident happens, it changes the speeds very rapidly, and
current conditions are no longer the same," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of these systems calculate travel times only on freeways
because that is where the pavement sensors are. But transportation
experts say the ultimate goal is to create a system that can make
estimates from your garage to the doorstep of your destination.</TE>
<TE>   Dearing, the writer from Echo Park, said she likes the idea of a
traffic forecast system but foresees one small glitch: "Would I
remember to check the forecast before I go? I don't know."</TE>

<HD>Arco Plaza Option Put Up for Sale</HD>
<DH>Real estate: An Orange County group only recently made a
deal for the landmark complex.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County investment group that recently obtained an option
to purchase the landmark Arco Plaza high-rise complex in downtown Los
Angeles has quietly put its position up for sale.</LD>
<LD>   Kings Capital, a San Juan Capistrano-based company headed by
investor Kenneth Picerne, announced in May that it had completed
transactions involving Arco Plaza and assets in Japan held by
affiliates of Arco Plaza owner Shuwa Investments Corp. The investment
group is said to have secured an option to purchase the 52-story Arco
Plaza complex at 5th and Flower streets for $255 million as part of
its acquisition of about $900 million in distressed Shuwa debt.</LD>
<LD>   Real estate investment sources say Picerne's group now wants to
sell its option to purchase the 40-year-old complex and has engaged
Century City real estate investment banking firm Eastdil Realty to
find a buyer.</LD>
<TE>   Picerne spokesman Mitch Rosenberg declined to comment on the Arco
Plaza transaction, as did Eastdil Managing Partner Kevin Dretzka.</TE>
<TE>   The relative health of downtown L.A.'s office market and recent
sales of high-rise office properties there suggest that Picerne will
receive offers higher than the $255-million option price, which
factors out to more than $100 per square foot, including the
complex's subterranean shopping mall.</TE>
<TE>   Observers in the commercial real estate investment community say
Kings Capital believes it can get $275 million or more for the
option. Japan-based Shuwa, controlled by the Shigeru Kobayashi
family, reportedly paid nearly $650 million for Arco Plaza during its
aggressive mid-1980s U.S. property-buying binge.</TE>
<TE>   Shuwa, reportedly burdened by debt, has sold several of its U.S.
real estate holdings in recent years, including a pair of Century
City high-rises. Arco Plaza had been offered for sale from time to
time individually or as part of a portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   Forbes magazine last month reported that Picerne's group, with
financing from global financial services company UBS Warburg,
acquired about $900 million worth of Shuwa debt from several lenders.
Sources with knowledge of the debt purchase said it was part of a
wholesale recapitalization of Shuwa's finances.</TE>
<TE>   Shuwa's cash flow challenges have stemmed to some degree from high
vacancy rate at its buildings, including nearly 1 million square feet
at Arco Plaza. The 515 Flower building is 69% leased, while the 555
Flower tower is 37% leased, according to real estate information
provider CoStar Group Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Arco Plaza's namesake anchor tenant no longer maintains offices at
the property, which long served as Arco's corporate headquarters
before the acquisition of the company by BP Amoco of Britain. Bank of
America's logo remains on the 555 Flower tower, and the name of law
firm Paul Hastings Janofsky &amp; Walker recently replaced Arco at the
515 Flower building.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown landlords enjoyed rising rents and higher occupancies
before the market stalled during the second quarter, according to
brokerage Insignia/ESG. Rents flattened after steady increases over
two years and downtown's shrinking tenant base sent the overall
vacancy rate back up to more than 20% after dipping below that mark
early in 2002 for the first time in several years.</TE>
<TE>   The market's improvements spawned substantial interest from
institutional and other investors in top-performing properties.
Observers said Arco Plaza is unlike those relatively stable
properties, however, and would be more probable to attract interest
from investors comfortable with the risk of attempting to add value
to the property through improvements.</TE>
<TE>   "You couldn't get much higher on the risk scale" than Arco Plaza,
said Jeremy Fletcher, regional chief executive with Boston-based
Beacon Capital, which recently agreed to pay a reported $270 million
for the 55-story 333 Hope tower. Despite downtown's general forward
momentum and Arco Plaza's favorable location, there is considerable
risk inherent in its high vacancy rate and costly capital needs,
Fletcher said.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative investors such as individual pension funds and
insurance companies probably wouldn't be interested, Fletcher said.
The most likely buyer would be a so-called opportunity fund that
specializes in improving troubled properties.</TE>

<HD>A Look Back at a Great Bull Market</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twenty years ago on this date, the stock market began what would
become one of the most momentous climbs in Wall Street's history.</LD>
<LD>   The great bull market of the 1980s, which became the even greater
bull market of the 1990s, was born Aug. 13, 1982, when the Dow Jones
industrial average jumped 11.13 points, or 1.4%, to 788.05.</LD>
<LD>   It was evident to probably few investors at the time, of course,
but the previous day the Dow finally had bottomed after mostly
languishing for the previous six years--a victim of high inflation
and high interest rates, weak corporate profits and a general sense
that American power was on the wane.</LD>
<TE>   True to historic form, the bull market began while the economy
still was mired in recession, and while many investors were sure that
stocks would never again have appeal. But inflation was on the
decline, the Federal Reserve was slashing interest rates, and many
companies were in the midst of wrenching cost cutting that would set
the scene for the profit boom of the mid-to late-'80s.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of 1982 the Dow was at 1,046. By the end of 1986 it
reached 1,895, and by the end of 1989 it was at 2,753, despite the
1987 market crash. On Monday the index closed at 8,688.89.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years from the 1982 market bottom, the Dow's price gain
stands at 1,018%. If dividends earned along the way are included, the
return is substantially higher.</TE>
<TE>   What about the next 20 years? Market historians note that the key
difference between the market today and the market of August 1982 is
that so many blue-chip stocks then were historically cheap, valued at
single-digit price-to-earnings ratios.</TE>
<TE>   Today, by contrast, the average blue-chip P/E ratio is about 18
based on estimated operating earnings for 2002.</TE>

<TE>One of the greatest bull markets in history began quietly Aug. 13,
1982, one day after the Dow Jones industrial average bottomed at
776.92. Here's a look at stock indexes and other investment gauges,
then and now.</TE>

<HD>CalPERS Says CEO Will Leave This Month</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CalPERS, the nation's biggest pension fund, said Monday that Chief
Executive James Burton would leave this month to lead the World Gold
Council in London.</LD>
<LD>   The California Public Employees' Retirement System had announced
in May that Burton would step down by the end of the year, but a
spokesman for the fund said the actual departure came a bit sooner
than expected.</LD>
<LD>   "He has gotten a job and it will take him some time to relocate,"
said CalPERS spokesman Brad Pacheco, who added that the pension fund
probably would name an interim CEO on Aug. 21.</LD>
<TE>   CalPERS, which has experienced a number of high-profile
resignations in the last year, also said it is on schedule to
identify Burton's permanent successor within the next two months.</TE>
<TE>   Burton, whose career spans 27 years with the state of California,
will step down Aug. 23 to take the CEO post at the World Gold
Council, the London-based association of the world's leading gold
mining companies, CalPERS said.</TE>
<TE>   Under Burton, the pension fund grew from $78 billion in 1994 to
its current value of some $140 billion, CalPERS said.</TE>
<TE>   But last August, CalPERS reported that the total value of its
assets for the fiscal year ended June 30 slid 7.2% from a year
earlier to $156 billion--marking the fund's worst overall return
since 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Burton joined CalPERS in 1992 as assistant executive officer for
investment operations.</TE>

<HD>Cendant Buys Lodging.com</HD>
<DH>Travel: The all-cash deal with the online reservation
company will help the biggest hotel franchiser expand its business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Cendant Corp., the biggest franchiser of hotels, bought online hotel
reservation company Lodging.com to expand its travel reservations
business. Terms of the all-cash transaction weren't disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Lodging.com handles about 115,000 hotel reservations a month, said
Elliot Bloom, a spokesman for Cendant, whose hotels include Howard
Johnson and Days Inn. Closely held Lodging.com offers unpublished,
discounted rates at about 3,000 hotels and has partnerships with more
than 2,500 travel-related Internet sites.</LD>
<LD>   New York-based Cendant, which is betting on an increase in travel
as the U.S. population ages, last year bought the Galileo
International travel reservation business for $2.34 billion. The
company later bought Cheap Tickets Inc. and started its Trip.com Web
site.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to franchising hotels, Cendant owns the Avis rental
car business and franchises Century 21, ERA and Coldwell Banker
residential brokers.</TE>
<TE>   Last year when Cendant was buying Galileo, the company's hotel
industry competitors raised concerns with regulators that the
purchase would give Cendant access to confidential data of other
hotels, providing its own businesses an advantage in setting prices.
Regulators approved the purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Cendant's inventory of timeshare properties will be added to
Lodging.com's site, the company said. Also, travel agencies and their
customers who use Galileo will gain access to Lodging.com's
inventory. Shares of Cendant were unchanged at $13.59 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Conseco Is Suspended From Trading on NYSE</HD>
<DH>Securities: The exchange cites the company's failure to
make bond payments and its 'abnormally low' share price.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Conseco Inc. shares were suspended from trading by the New York Stock
Exchange and may be delisted, the exchange said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The move follows the insurance and finance company's announcement
Friday that it won't make some bond payments and has asked its
lenders to restructure its $6.5 billion in debt, the Big Board said.</LD>
<LD>   The exchange cited the company's failure to make the payments, as
well as the "abnormally low selling price" of Conseco's shares, for
the suspension.</LD>
<TE>   The stock has fallen 96% in the last year, closing Thursday at 34
cents, as Chairman Gary Wendt has struggled to overhaul the firm and
repay debt amid high loan losses and slumping earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Conseco shares slid 21 cents, to 13 cents a share, in
over-the-counter trading.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see how they avoid Chapter 11" bankruptcy, said Bill
Batcheller, a money manager at National City Corp., which manages $89
billion and used to own Conseco shares.</TE>
<TE>   Conseco bondholders held a conference call on Monday to discuss
setting up a committee of creditors, said Robert Rodriguez, a money
manager at First Pacific Advisors, which owns Conseco bonds and
stock.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a goal of getting this resolved in a very time-sensitive
fashion in the next 30 days," Rodriguez said. "That's going to be a
very large task to achieve."</TE>
<TE>   Carmel, Ind.-based Conseco can appeal the exchange's decision, the
Big Board said. The exchange said it may suspend trading of a stock
"if it believes that continued dealings in the security on the NYSE
are not advisable."</TE>
<TE>   "The New York Stock Exchange announcement this morning was not
unexpected, and we will be dealing with these issues as part of the
restructuring process," said Mark Lubbers, a spokesman for Conseco.</TE>

<HD>Drought Prompts USDA to Slash Crop Estimates</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: The turnaround is the most dramatic for corn
and soybeans; bumper crops had been expected. Futures prices jump.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ABBOTT</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Brutal drought in the American Grain Belt, part of a downturn in
crops worldwide, will bring the smallest U.S. corn and soybean
harvest since the mid-1990s, the government said Monday, whipping a
price stampede that could run far into next year.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. crops might shrivel more without relief from a drought that
has gripped one-third of the nation. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture reported crop losses on every continent, ending a
remarkable five-year run of large crops globally.</LD>
<LD>   Smaller crops would have no immediate effect on U.S. consumer food
prices, now running a modest 2.4% higher than last year.</LD>
<TE>   But private consultant John Schnittker foresaw "market tension"
for the next 18 months to find enough grain and oilseeds for food,
livestock feed and industrial use. Food makers will pay more for
grain for at least 15 months.</TE>
<TE>   "We absolutely have to have good crops in 2003. Any further
reduction will send prices sharply higher," Schnittker said.</TE>
<TE>   The forecast sent corn and wheat futures contracts in Chicago
rocketing to five-year highs. Soybeans hit a four-year high.</TE>
<TE>   Near-term corn futures jumped to nearly $2.61 per bushel, up from
about $2.50 on Friday. Near-term wheat futures surged to nearly $3.52
per bushel, up from $3.445 on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Soybeans for delivery in November ended the day at $5.5275 a
bushel, up a whopping 27.5 cents.</TE>
<TE>   "The stage is set for some pretty high prices," said Keith
Collins, the USDA's chief economist. "Right now, things look like we
are going to have a much tighter market for the 2002 crop year and
into the 2003 crop year as well."</TE>
<TE>   Surpluses amassed in the nation's warehouses during the global
grain glut could be depleted quickly.</TE>
<TE>   The corn stockpile, now 1.6 billion bushels, was forecast to
shrink to 767 million bushels by next September, the smallest tally
since 1996. Only 155 million bushels of soybeans would be on hand in
September 2003, the lowest "carry-over" from one marketing year to
another since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Based on surveys of 22,000 farmers and firsthand examination of
crops, the USDA forecast a harvest of 8.89 billion bushels of corn,
2.62 billion bushels of soybeans, 1.69 billion bushels of wheat and
18.44 million bales of cotton. A bale of cotton weighs 480 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   If the forecasts prove true, it would be the smallest corn crop
since 1995, the smallest soybean crop since 1996 and the smallest
wheat crop since 1972.</TE>
<TE>   The most-parched areas of the nation include the Plains states
from Montana to Texas and portions of the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   The turnaround was the most dramatic for corn and soybeans, of
which bumper crops had been expected this year. Wheat output has been
waning for four years.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller crops are certain to fuel a drive in Congress for billions
in drought disaster relief for farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Farm state leaders have been unable to agree on a bill amid fears
of a backlash for seeking aid just three months after President Bush
enacted a law expected to boost farm subsidy spending by 67%.</TE>
<TE>   "The president and I continue to be very concerned about the
drought situation," Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman told
reporters. "We stand ready to work with Congress," but any disaster
aid must be offset by budget cuts, she said.</TE>
<TE>   In the interim, Veneman announced $150 million in feed assistance
for cattle ranchers in Colorado, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wyoming,
where pastures have been turned brown by two years of scant rainfall.</TE>
<TE>   Drought "is felt up and down every Main Street in South Dakota,
the ripple effect of liquidation" of livestock herds, said Rep. John
R. Thune, a Republican from that state.</TE>
<TE>   "I just believe there is a lot more we have to do" to help the
farm sector, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, a corn yield of 125.2 bushels an acre was forecast, 13
bushels less than last year, the USDA said. Hot weather hurt corn
pollination in Nebraska, Kansas, South Dakota and North Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   Soybean yields were forecast to slide in Nebraska, experiencing
its worst drought in 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   This year's soybean crop was forecast to fetch about $5.60 a
bushel at the farm gate, highest since a global glut sent grain
prices skidding five years ago. The USDA said corn would average
$2.50 a bushel, also the highest since 1997-98.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles real estate brokerage Charles Dunn Co. has selected a
vice chairman to lead an expansion of the 80-year-old company.</LD>
<LD>   Jay D. Haskell has been appointed to the new position and is
expected eventually to succeed Walter J. Conn as chairman.</LD>
<LD>   Haskell, formerly chairman and president of competitor Seeley Co.,
already has hired former Seeley brokers Wayne Saldana and Mike
Tingus, and he expects to bring in more help.</LD>
<TE>   Charles Dunn has 70 brokers in Los Angeles and Orange counties.
Haskell said he hopes to expand to 100 brokers by the end of 2003.
The company is relatively light in the industrial division, he said.
He also plans to strengthen the property management and investment
divisions.</TE>
<TE>   "Real estate has become the primary investment for many people,"
Conn said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're building to be able to find the right investments for our
clients."</TE>
<TE>   Charles Dunn headquarters is in downtown Los Angeles. The firm has
about 500 employees in California and Arizona and annual revenue of
$30 million, according to a company statement.</TE>
<TE>   Conn and former Los Angeles residential real estate mogul Fred
Sands are the primary owners.</TE>

<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Several former Enron Corp. insiders who earned a combined $25 million
in the year before the company crashed are asking for millions more
in severance pay, a question a bankruptcy judge Monday said he will
answer later this month.</LD>
<LD>   The list of executives includes the wife of former Chief Executive
Jeffrey K. Skilling, Rebecca Carter, and former Vice Chairman Mark
Frevert, who has asked for more than $6 million in severance pay.
Carter, who was Enron's corporate secretary before marrying Skilling
in March, wants $875,000.</LD>
<LD>   The executives are among 46 laid-off employees who opted not to
participate in a settlement that would provide up to $13,500 in
severance to each of the workers laid off as a result of Enron's Dec.
2 bankruptcy filing. The Houston-based energy merchant said in a
court filing that it has paid $32 million in severance thus far.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez said he would decide by the
end of the month whether those who opted out of the severance deal
are entitled to anything, and if so, how much.</TE>
<TE>   If Gonzalez rules the insiders are entitled to more than they
would have been paid under the deal, those who have agreed to it can
back out and send the process back to the drawing board.</TE>
<TE>   Frevert, who was made vice chairman after Skilling's departure
last August, was paid $17.3 million in the year before Enron
collapsed. He claims that he is owed $6.6 million in severance, a
calculation that was based in part on his performance bonus, court
records show.</TE>
<TE>   The bankruptcy creditor's committee and Enron both said they
needed more time to investigate Frevert's claim.</TE>
<TE>   Frevert's "employment and termination package was substantially
increased shortly before the filing and whose duties remained
unclear," until after his firing in December, the creditor's
committee said in a court filing made Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Carter earned $477,500 in the year before the collapse. John
Sherriff, the former head of Enron Europe, earned $4.3 million in the
same period and has asked for $1.6 million more.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Dodson, a former executive in Enron's engineering
division, has asked for $210,000 on top of the $319,000 he earned
last year. Charles Garland earned $1.6 million last year as a
managing director at Enron and wants $892,000 in severance.</TE>
<TE>   Certain employees are entitled to ask for "administrative
expenses" to reimburse them for work they did that helped preserve
the value of the company after it went into bankruptcy. The creditors
committee argued that most of them did no work after the filing.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating the executives' claims is the fact their employment
contracts were nullified on the day Enron filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Further, that was a Sunday, and most employees were told to stay
home pending their formal layoff notices. Most received theirs by
Wednesday of that week.</TE>

<HD>Airlines Stop Fare Cuts for Last-Minute Travelers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>The major airlines, led by Northwest Airlines Corp. and AMR Corp.'s
American, have called off a fare war that erupted this month over the
highest-priced tickets, those for last-minute travel.</LD>
<LD>   At the peak of the battle, some fares fell as much as 40%.</LD>
<LD>   But over the weekend, published fares for tickets with no
advance-purchase requirement were back to their old levels.</LD>
<TE>   Northwest on Saturday restored its pre-Aug. 1 top business and
coach fares but also said it would give 5% to 10% discounts for
customers who buy tickets from a travel agent or directly from the
airline.</TE>
<TE>   American, UAL Corp.'s United, Delta Air Lines Inc. and Continental
Airlines Inc. matched Northwest's move to return business fares to
their earlier, higher levels, while US Airways kept discounts on some
routes, said Tom Parsons, chief executive of the travel site
Bestfares.com.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time it raised fares back to Aug. 1 levels, American
kept 5% to 10% discounts for tickets sold through select travel
agents, Parsons said.</TE>
<TE>   American officials did not immediately return a call for comment.</TE>
<TE>   While they lasted, the fare cuts were seen as making it harder for
airlines to return to profitability.</TE>
<TE>   The major U.S. carriers lost more than $1 billion in the second
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Of the largest seven carriers, only Southwest Airlines Inc. has
been profitable since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Parsons said that although the deep fare-cutting appears to be
over, business travelers tapping the travel agency discounts could
still save as much as 10%, or $200 off the typical last-minute
coast-to-coast fare.</TE>

<HD>Homestore Settles Suit, Reports Loss</HD>
<DH>Internet: Results improve in second quarter. They include a
$23-million charge for securities fraud claims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Homestore.com Inc., the largest source of for-sale home listings on
the Internet, announced a second-quarter net loss of $52.3 million
Monday after agreeing to pay $23 million to settle a lawsuit that
accused the company of securities fraud.</LD>
<LD>   The second-quarter loss is a substantial improvement over the
year-earlier net loss of $120.9 million, despite a 15% decline in
revenue to $65.9 million.</LD>
<LD>   But the Westlake Village company said it was unable to make any
forecasts for 2003--a troubling sign to analysts.</LD>
<TE>   "They're going in the right direction," said Safa Rashtchy, senior
analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. "But their balance sheet needs
to be simplified and cleaned up."</TE>
<TE>   Homestore's latest results reflect a $23-million charge for the
settlement of litigation with telemarketing company MemberWorks Inc.</TE>
<TE>   They also include a gain from discontinued operations of $10.2
million from the sale of the company's ConsumerInfo division this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Stamford, Conn.-based MemberWorks filed its lawsuit in March,
after Homestore restated certain financial statements following an
inquiry by the board's audit committee into questionable accounting
practices. The restatement caused Homestore's shares to tumble.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore agreed in August 2001 to buy IPlace, an Internet company
that collects and analyzes crime information from police
jurisdictions, from MemberWorks for about $72 million in cash and
stock worth about $78 million.</TE>
<TE>   MemberWorks claimed in its lawsuit that it was unable to sell any
of the Homestore shares it had received in the sale in the wake of
Homestore's restatement.</TE>
<TE>   In April, weeks after Homestore announced its accounting problems,
the company reached a deal to sell ConsumerInfo, a unit of IPlace,
for $130 million in cash to credit-checking company Experian.</TE>
<TE>   MemberWorks then obtained a court order placing $58 million of the
$130-million cash proceeds in a constructive trust in favor of the
plaintiffs, pending the outcome of litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the settlement announced Monday, $23 million of the
trust will be released to MemberWorks and other former IPlace
shareholders to settle their claims.</TE>
<TE>   MemberWorks will receive about $19.2 million in cash. Homestore
will receive the remaining $35 million of unrestricted cash from the
constructive trust after the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Homestore.com closed at 92 cents Monday on Nasdaq, up 8
cents. Shares of MemberWorks closed at $14.74, up $1.77, also trading
on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore said that in the third quarter it would record a
$58-million reduction in restricted cash, as well as a $35-million
increase in cash and cash equivalents.</TE>
<TE>   The company had posted $64.9 million in cash and cash equivalents
available to fund operations in June, plus $151.2 million in
restricted cash.</TE>
<TE>   Its viability is questionable, however, depending on how well the
new management executes its business plan, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "This company is still shedding businesses, still seeing one-time
charges," said Jeetil Patel, senior analyst at Deutsche Bank.</TE>
<TE>   "The strategy is still in progress. But balance-sheet-wise, it
looks better. It will take a couple of quarters to see where they're
going."</TE>

<HD>Sun Launches Server That Runs on Linux</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sun Microsystems Inc., whose server computers power networks and Web
sites, introduced a machine that will run on the free Linux operating
system, a bid to stem a drop in sales as users seek less expensive
products.</LD>
<LD>   Customers can choose the LX50 server running on Sun's Solaris
software or the company's version of Linux. Prices for the computer
start at $2,795, compared with more than $1 million for some of Sun's
most powerful machines running on Unix software.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts say Santa Clara, Calif.-based Sun, which has built its
business selling servers that run only on its Solaris operating
system and Sparc chips, has lost sales as cheaper machines based on
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows software and Intel chips become more
reliable. Sun's decision to offer a Linux machine based on chips like
Intel's is an admission that so-called Wintel systems are a threat,
investors say.</LD>
<TE>   "They probably denied it for years, and this is saying, 'We can't
just sit back and let them chip away at our franchise,' " said Ken
Smith, who helps manage $30 billion at Munder Capital Management, a
Sun and Microsoft shareholder.</TE>
<TE>   Sun Chief Executive Scott McNealy said the company is gaining
market share for servers that use the Unix operating system.</TE>
<TE>   "We're growing like crazy in Unix revenue with 58.8% market share.
We gained 7.6% in market share year over year, while IBM lost 4.6
points," McNealy said. "It's a situation where you don't have to
outrun the bear, you have to outrun the other hikers."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Sun fell 5 cents to $4.12 in Nasdaq trading.</TE>

<HD>Valley, South Bay to Get Retail Projects</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Competition among shopping centers in the Los Angeles area will get
only tougher in the years ahead--developers have unveiled plans for
two giant retail projects in the San Fernando Valley and the South
Bay.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles-based mall titan Westfield America plans to add nearly
600,000 square feet of retail space, including some free-standing
buildings, at its Westfield Shoppingtown Topanga in the west San
Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The mall at Topanga Canyon and Victory boulevards in Canoga Park
has more than 130 stores and nearly 5,500 parking spaces, but company
officials say the property is underused. They said they are in the
early phases of planning and do not have cost estimates or a
timetable for construction.</LD>
<TE>   "We are looking at bringing more of the uses and critical mass
that is missing from the Topanga project today," said David Doll,
senior executive vice president of development.</TE>
<TE>   The company also owns the recently renovated Westfield
Shoppingtown Promenade, about half a mile south of the Topanga mall
on Topanga Canyon Boulevard. Westfield has indicated that it is
looking at potential office and residential development on land it
owns between the two retail centers.</TE>
<TE>   The expansion of Shoppingtown Topanga will help keep it
competitive with nearby malls by attracting shoppers who had been
traveling to Ventura County and Los Angeles' Westside, strategic
marketing executive Randy Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   The mall's expansion will help fill the void left by retailers,
such as Montgomery Ward, that have shuttered their operations in the
area, Los Angeles City Councilman Dennis P. Zine said. "As these
stores close ... we are losing jobs and losing sales tax" revenue if
they are not replaced, said Zine, who supports the expansion.</TE>
<TE>   In the South Bay city of Carson, Carlsbad, Calif., retail
developer GMS Realty and Cherokee Investment Partners plan to build a
large outdoor shopping and entertainment center on the 157-acre LA
MetroMall site at the 405 Freeway and Avalon Boulevard. The firms
have agreed to purchase the site from the Glaziers Pension Trust,
according to Ken Hira, assistant vice president with GMS Realty.</TE>
<TE>   GMS would be in charge of the retail development, called South Bay
Crossing, and Cherokee, a specialist in the development of brownfield
sites, would manage an environmental cleanup of the site, Hira said.
The parcel can accommodate about 1.5 million square feet of retail
development, Hira said. Development of the site could take three to
five years.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Stall Before Fed Meeting</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: After US Airways' bankruptcy filing, investors
appear cautious about a swift recovery in the economy and corporate
profits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street stalled Monday as investors took profits from last week's
big rally and considered the possibility that the Federal Reserve
might not cut interest rates after all when it meets today. Blue
chips pulled back slightly, while technology shares managed a small
gain.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said would-be buyers wanted to see what retail earnings
and other economic data due out this week look like, and whether
companies would meet a government deadline to certify financial
statements later this week. Also weighing on the market was Sunday's
bankruptcy filing by US Airways Group, which prompted investors to
dump airline shares.</LD>
<LD>   "The news is not appetizing," said Larry Wachtel, stock market
analyst for Prudential Securities. "You have the US Air bankruptcy
and there's a universal belief the Fed won't be cutting rates [on
Tuesday]. The economy is also a source of concern."</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, yields on longer-term Treasuries fell again as
declining stocks boosted demand for government securities.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 56.56 points, or
0.7%, at 8,688.89, cutting short a four-session winning streak and
paring last week's 432-point gain--the Dow's best weekly performance
since September.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index slipped 4.84 points, or 0.5%, to
903.80, with financial stocks contributing almost half of the
decline. The Nasdaq composite index was little changed, rising less
than a point to 1,306.84.</TE>
<TE>   Losers led winners by 9 to 8 on Nasdaq, and were about even on the
New York Stock Exchange. Trading was light.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks recouped some of their losses in the final two hours of
trading. Some investors and traders said buyers were lured into the
market because the early sell-off, which drove down the S&amp;P 500 by as
much as 1.8%, was smaller than expected after four days of gains.</TE>
<TE>   "They tried to take them down hard and they couldn't, and some
people got encouraged by that," said Tom Schrader, head of listed
trading at Legg Mason Wood Walker.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks rose steadily last week on a mix of bargain hunting after a
huge sell-off and hopes that the Fed might cut interest rates further
because of data suggesting that the economy is faltering. The Fed's
Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet today, but by Monday most
analysts were downplaying the possibility of a reduction.</TE>
<TE>   Financial stocks were among last week's best performers, on
expectations a rate cut would reduce their costs and boost profits.
They gave back some of those gains Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup lost 23 cents to $34.08; J.P. Morgan Chase slipped 89
cents to $25.46; and Fannie Mae, the biggest purchaser of mortgages,
dropped $1 to $74.10.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was higher confidence of a rate cut [today], the
financials wouldn't be down as much as they are," James Weiss, chief
investment officer for equities at State Street Research &amp; Management
Co., told Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury
note fell to its lowest level in a week--to 4.21% from 4.26%
Friday--as expectations of a rate cut waned.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the two-year T-note, which more closely tracks moves
in the Fed's target interest rate, was unchanged at 2.07%. A week ago
the note's yield had reached a record low of 1.89% as some traders
had bet the Fed would cut rates for a 12th time since January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Losses in "stocks are going to underpin the bond market as long as
they continue," said Michael Cloherty, a fixed-income strategist at
Credit Suisse First Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the main issue for the stock market remains the
prospects for improving profits at companies, many of whom so far
have been hesitant to say business is getting better.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to bounce around until we get a clear picture about
whether the economy is going to accelerate in the second half or
consumer spending will slow," said Mike Kayes, chief investment
officer at Eastover Capital.</TE>
<TE>   Investors also will be watching this week to see whether the
companies required to certify their financial reports meet the
Securities and Exchange Commission's deadline on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Only about a quarter of the companies required to file this week
had done so as of Monday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading, the dollar fell against the euro and the yen.
Oil rose $1 to $27.86 a barrel in New York trading as Iraq said it
won't allow U.N. weapons inspectors back in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Other highlights included:</TE>
<TE>   * US Airways' decision to file for bankruptcy over the weekend
soured the session for the airlines sector. UAL, United Airlines'
parent, fell $1.40 to $3.80, a decline of 26.9%, on concerns the
airline might be the next carrier forced into bankruptcy. AMR, parent
of American Airlines, lost $1.23 to $8.36, and the Bloomberg index of
18 U.S. airline stocks fell 6.3% with every member losing ground
except US Airways, which didn't trade Monday on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial aircraft maker Boeing, a Dow industrial, fell 50 cents
to $40.50.</TE>
<TE>   * Investors also were focused on retailers, many of whom are
expected to report earnings today including J.C. Penney and Wal-Mart
Stores. Penney rose 12 cents to $16.75, while Wal-Mart fell 79 cents
to $48.41.</TE>
<TE>   * Technology stocks, which had enjoyed sizable gains last week,
struggled. Intel fell 33 cents to $17.53 after Salomon Smith Barney
reduced its estimates on the stock, citing soft demand. Applied
Materials, which counts Intel as one of its biggest customers,
slipped 28 cents to $13.58 ahead of earnings due out today.</TE>
<TE>   * Overseas markets were lower. Japan's Nikkei index fell 2.5%. In
Europe, key share indexes fell 3% in Germany, 2.3% in Britain and
2.4% in France.</TE>

<HD>Report: Martha Stewart's Broker Blames Assistant</HD>
<DH>Probe: A newspaper says Merrill employee claims the aide
tipped off his famous client about ImClone shares.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stockbroker for Martha Stewart claims his assistant took the
initiative to tip her off with "inappropriate information" about
insider sales of shares in biotechnology company ImClone Systems
Inc., the Financial Times reported late Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The newspaper's Web site, citing people familiar with Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. broker Peter Bacanovic's version of events, said the
broker also believes that his assistant, Douglas Faneuil, fabricated
claims that he passed on the information under his chief's orders to
spare himself from possible charges.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Strassberg, Bacanovic's attorney, declined to comment on
the report when contacted by Reuters. Attorneys for Faneuil and
Stewart also had no comment.</LD>
<TE>   Stewart, chief executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc.,
is being investigated for possible insider trading for selling almost
4,000 shares of ImClone a day before the company publicly announced
regulators had refused to review its cancer drug, Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   She has denied wrongdoing, citing a preexisting arrangement to
sell the stock if it fell below $60 a share.</TE>
<TE>   The Financial Times said Bacanovic's defense emerged for the first
time as Samuel D. Waksal, ImClone's founder and former chief
executive, pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges stemming from the
government probe into insider trading at the biotechnology company
last December.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal, a close friend of Stewart, was arrested in June for
allegedly trying to sell shares in ImClone and tip off his family
members just before the Food and Drug Administration publicly
rejected the company's application for Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   Bacanovic and Faneuil were placed on paid leave by Merrill in June
after an internal probe.</TE>
<TE>   Faneuil is understood to have told the Justice Department that
Bacanovic told him to call Stewart to warn her that Waksal was
selling his ImClone shares.</TE>

<HD>May Profit Falls 38% Amid Consolidation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL KATZ</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>May Department Stores Co., the owner of Lord &amp; Taylor and Filene's
stores, said profit fell 38%, the sixth straight quarterly decline,
because of costs of combing four chains into two divisions.</LD>
<LD>   Its fiscal second-quarter net income dropped to $69 million, or 22
cents a share, from $111 million, or 35 cents, a year earlier. Sales
in the three months ended Aug. 3 declined 1.7% to $3.1 billion, the
company said.</LD>
<LD>   May, the first major retailer to release earnings this quarter, is
combining operations to reduce expenses amid increased competition
from discount chains such as Kohl's Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Sales at stores open at least a year slipped 4.9% at the
fourth-largest U.S. department store company as shoppers sought out
bargains and visited malls less.</TE>
<TE>   "People are going to retailers that have pretty good merchandise
where you can get a deal," said Matt Spitznagle, an analyst at
Northern Trust Corp., whose $330 billion in assets included about
1.36 million May shares as of March. "They can get in and out and
don't have to walk through the mall."</TE>
<TE>   May Chief Executive Eugene Kahn this month completed the
combination of the Kaufmann's and Filene's divisions in the Northeast
and the Robinsons-May and Meier &amp; Frank units in the West and
Northwest.</TE>
<TE>   May expects $60 million in annual pretax savings from the
consolidation. The company now has six divisions.</TE>
<TE>   "May is a battleship," said Abhay Deshpande, a senior analyst at
Arnhold &amp; S. Bleichroeder Capital, whose $3.5 billion in assets
include about 17,000 May shares. "Trying to turn it around takes a
lot of time."</TE>
<TE>   May shares fell 23 cents to $27.55 on the New York Stock Exchange.
They have declined 25% this year, compared with a 12% drop in the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 department store index.</TE>
<TE>   May is introducing private-label clothing brands such as Be this
month to attract younger shoppers. Such exclusive apparel usually has
a higher profit margin than national brands, investors said. The
company also has purchased wedding gown and tuxedo rental chains,
including Priscilla of Boston, to increase sales beyond the Christmas
season.</TE>
<TE>   May has 436 department stores, including the Hecht's and
Strawbridge's stores, as well as 163 David's Bridal stores, 238 After
Hours Formalwear stores and 10 Priscilla of Boston stores.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding $37 million in costs to combine the units, May said
profit would have been 34 cents. On that basis, results were 1 cent
more than the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson First
Call.</TE>

<HD>McDonald's Sales in Japan Rise on Cuts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Japanese poured into McDonald's restaurants in record numbers last
week after it slashed hamburger prices to their lowest ever,
persuading one in four people to eat there.</LD>
<LD>   McDonald's Holdings Co., Japan's biggest fast-food chain, reported
a 15% sales jump in the week ending Aug. 9, signaling a possible
turnaround for the vendor of low-priced meals that has been
devastated by the effect of an outbreak of mad cow disease and the
unwillingness of Japanese to spend during a recession.</LD>
<LD>   The unit of U.S. fast-food giant McDonald's Corp. said sales for
the week stood at $77.89 million from a record 30.1 million
customers, surpassing the 27.78 million hamburger fans who ate at its
stores in April 2001. "The results demonstrate that one-quarter of
the population visited our restaurants," it said.</LD>
<TE>   The number of customers rose 25% from the previous week after it
slashed prices Aug. 5, selling plain hamburgers for 50 cents, down
from 67 cents, and cheeseburgers for 66 cents instead of $1--their
lowest prices ever in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   The price cuts were to counter a sales slump since last September
when an outbreak of mad cow disease in Japan led many to shun its
3,800 outlets despite assurances that it uses only imported beef.</TE>

<HD>4 More Firms to Alter Accounting on Options</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., American Express Co., MetLife Inc. and Bank
of America Corp. will begin expensing stock options next year,
joining a growing list of financial institutions, insurance firms and
manufacturers adopting the practice.</LD>
<LD>   The move at J.P. Morgan was outlined in a memorandum to the bank's
employees from Chairman and Chief Executive William B. Harrison Jr.
The memo was made public Monday by the bank.</LD>
<LD>   Harrison also said the New York-based bank has created a policy
review office to examine "transactions and products in terms of
appropriateness, ethics and reputational risk."</LD>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan and the nation's largest bank, Citigroup Inc., were
recently accused by congressional investigators of helping Enron
Corp. disguise its debt and boost its cash flow. The Houston-based
energy trading company filed for bankruptcy protection Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup last week said it would set up a committee on governance
and ensure its loans were properly reported. Citigroup also said it
would charge its stock options as an expense against earnings.</TE>
<TE>   The move to expense stock options has been urged by corporate
reformers who say this will more accurately reflect the effect on
shareholders than the current system, which has options in footnotes
of annual reports.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison said the decision on options was being announced "in
partnership with the Financial Services Forum--an organization made
up of 21 chief executives of the largest, most-diversified financial
services firms in the United States--because we believe it would be
best for investors to have consistency across our industry."</TE>
<TE>   Harrison said the effect on the bank's earnings will be about 7
cents a share in 2003 and 20 cents a share when fully phased in. The
effect is higher, he said, because "we are one of the few companies
that offers an options program to almost all employees."</TE>
<TE>   American Express, headquartered in New York, said that "all future
employee stock option grants beginning in 2003 will be expensed over
the stock option vesting period, based on the fair value at the date
the options are granted." It said that if the system had been in
effect this year, the effect on earnings would have been 7 cents a
share.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America in Charlotte, N.C., said that it also will expense
options. MetLife, based in New York, said that if the decision were
applied to 2002 earnings it would shave 2 to 3 cents a share from
profit.</TE>

<HD>Mitsubishi to Market in Mexico With Daimler's Aid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mitsubishi Motors America Inc. said Monday that it will draw on its
alliance with DaimlerChrysler to begin marketing Mitsubishi-brand
vehicles in Mexico next year.</LD>
<LD>   Mexican consumers purchase 900,000 new cars and light trucks a
year, and the market is considered an important part of any auto
maker's North American expansion strategy.</LD>
<LD>   Mitsubishi is riding high on three consecutive years of record
sales and profit in the U.S. and has launched an aggressive expansion
campaign that will see it begin Canadian sales next month.</LD>
<TE>   The company's North American growth strategy is "critical for
Mitsubishi's global ambitions," said Steve Torok, Tokyo-based
executive vice president of international car operations for
Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Mitsubishi will join Honda Motor Co., Nissan Motor Co., Toyota
Motor Corp., Renault, PSA Peugeot Citroen, Volkswagen, Ford Motor
Co., General Motors Corp. and DaimlerChrysler among major car makers
in the Mexican market.</TE>
<TE>   Pierre Gagnon, Mitsubishi Motors America's president and chief
executive, said the company will launch Mexican sales in January with
most of the same lineup it markets in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The Mitsubishi cars and sport utility vehicles will be sold by a
dealership group to be selected by DaimlerChrysler Mexico from its
122 Chrysler dealers, Gagnon said. The selected dealers will build
separate showrooms adjacent to their existing Chrysler facilities.</TE>

<HD>Ford Motor to Sell Kwik-Fit Chain at Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. said it agreed to sell its Kwik-Fit vehicle-repair
chain to a private equity group for less than a third of what the
world's No. 2 auto maker paid for the business three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The private equity group, London-based CVC Capital Partners, will
purchase Kwik-Fit for $500 million in cash and a note to be paid as
CVC obtains outside financing, Ford said.</LD>
<LD>   Regulatory approval for the deal also is needed.</LD>
<TE>   Ford, which will retain a 19% equity stake in Kwik-Fit, said it
will record a charge of $500 million in the third quarter as a result
of the sale.</TE>
<TE>   The company paid the equivalent of $1.6 billion for Kwik-Fit in
1999, as part of a strategy under former Chief Executive Jacques
Nasser to branch out into a broad array of automotive products and
services.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford closed down 20 cents at
$11.64 on the NYSE.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Toyota Motor Corp.'s Prius car qualified for a $2,000 U.S. tax
deduction, the first gasoline-electric vehicle to be certified in a
program to encourage sales of low-pollution cars and trucks. Buyers
of new 2001, 2002 and 2003 models can claim the deduction for the
year in which the car first was put to use, the Internal Revenue
Service said.</LD>
<LD>   The fuel-efficient vehicles combine a gasoline engine and an
electric motor and are more popular than electric vehicles, which
have limited range because of the need to recharge the batteries.</LD>
<LD>   The auto maker's American depositary receipts, which represent two
ordinary shares, fell 50 cents to $50.95 in New York Stock Exchange
trading. They have declined less than 1% this year.</LD>

<LD>Inamed Corp., the maker of a surgical device to treat obesity, said
it's reviewing the way it accounted for debt, taxes and warranties
for breast implants and may have costs of as much as $10.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement, made after the markets closed, sent shares of
the Santa Barbara-based company down as much as $4.19, or 23%, to
$14.22 in after-hours trading. They had closed up 11 cents at $18.41
on Nasdaq.</LD>
<LD>   The company said it doesn't expect to file its quarterly report
with the Securities and Exchange Commission until after Wednesday,
the SEC deadline for companies to certify the accuracy of financial
reports.</LD>
<TE>   Inamed said it's examining accounting for long-term notes issued
between 1996 and 1999 and restating those figures may result in
after-tax costs of $5 million.</TE>

Citigroup Inc. agreed to reduce the fee the California thrift must
pay if it backs out of its proposed sale to the world's largest
financial services company.</LD>
<LD>   Golden State, the No. 3 U.S. thrift company, said it will pay
Citigroup $42.5 million to $160 million if it cancels the deal. The
bank had agreed to pay $117.5 million to $235 million.</LD>
<LD>   Citigroup said in May that it would pay about $5.8 billion in cash

<LD>The Treasury Department sold $16 billion in three-month bills at a

billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 1.59%, up from
1.555%.</LD>

investors--1.659% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,958.80, and 1.625% for a six-month bill selling for $9,919.60.</LD>

for one-year constant-maturity Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, fell to 1.67% last

<LD>Ford Motor Co. said it tentatively settled a class-action lawsuit by
lease customers who said they were charged excessive penalties for
making late payments.</LD>
<LD>   Ford agreed to pay as much as $80 million to 1.8 million lease
customers and about $7 million in legal fees. The auto maker said it
mailed notices of the settlement to the affected customers last
month.</LD>
<LD>   A company spokeswoman said Ford still believed that there was
nothing excessive about its late fees, which were 7.5% of the monthly
lease payment or $50, whichever was less.</LD>
<TE>   The case grew out of a suit filed in California in the mid-1990s
and a second case filed later in Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing for final approval of the settlement is scheduled for
Sept. 20.</TE>

<LD>   The Anaheim company, which offers such brands as Reef, Good Vibes,
Puma, Tilt and Split, had raised its profit outlook Thursday to
between 21 cents and 22 cents from an earlier forecast of 18 cents,
citing stronger than expected July sales. Analysts then increased
their estimates to an average 20 cents from 18 cents.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second time in seven months, Prandium Inc.'s plan to sell the
Hamburger Hamlet restaurant chain has fallen through.</LD>
<LD>   The Irvine-based operator of Chi-Chi's and Koo Koo Roo said in a
statement that it has terminated a $15-million deal to sell the
14-unit upscale burger chain to Los Angeles-based Latin Intellectual
Properties. No reason was given for the collapse.</LD>
<LD>   Prandium, which recently received court approval for its
prepackaged bankruptcy reorganization, had tried earlier this year to
unload the Hamlet. In February, Prandium terminated a $16.1-million
cash deal with Beverly Hills-based Othello Holding Corp. after the
purchaser failed to meet certain terms.</LD>
<TE>   Prandium, which operates more than 170 restaurants, reported sales
of nearly $70 million in the first quarter.</TE>

<LD>The government approved a new treatment for the nation's
second-leading cancer killer--after a record-setting seven-week
review--a last-ditch chemotherapy for advanced-stage patients who
have exhausted standard drugs.</LD>
<LD>   When taking Eloxatin together with older drugs, about 9% of
treated colon cancer patients saw their tumors shrink significantly
and they gained about two months before the cancer started growing
again. But until now these patients have had no other alternative
once standard treatment failed.</LD>
<LD>   The drug, made by the French pharmaceutical company
Sanofi-Synthelabo, was approved faster than any other cancer
treatment; only AIDS drugs have passed through the FDA more quickly.</LD>

<LD>*  Maytag Corp. shares fell 5% after the No. 3 U.S. appliance maker
laid off workers and said third-quarter gross profit would be hurt by
slower production to clear excess inventory. The stock fell $1.56 to
$29.81 on the NYSE. It has fallen 7.3% in the last year.</LD>
<LD>   The job cuts occurred this month at two refrigerator plants after
retailers pared June orders, a spokesman said. The workers may be
rehired if production picks up, he said.</LD>

<HD>S. Korean Regulators Warn UBS Warburg About Research Leaks</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>South Korean regulators issued a "severe disciplinary warning" to the
country's top foreign brokerage, UBS Warburg, today after finding it
leaked market-sensitive research to investors up to six days before
publishing them.</LD>
<LD>   UBS Warburg files, telephone logs and e-mails revealed it leaked
research on 11 firms including South Korea's largest, Samsung
Electronics, the Financial Supervisory Commission said in a
statement.</LD>
<LD>   It risks being forced to close its South Korean operations for at
least six months if it violates rules again, FSC spokeswoman Kim
Ji-ho told Reuters.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling covered 15 UBS Warburg staffers and was announced
together with sanctions against six staffers at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.,
also stemming from improper disclosure and violations of securities
laws.</TE>
<TE>   "Their sanction is one degree less severe," the FSC spokeswoman
said regarding the Merrill sanctions.</TE>

<HD>Ex-State Farm Agents Win Damages</HD>
<DH>Courts: $12.6 million goes to two men who were fired and
blocked from selling rival policies to former clients.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL LIEDTKE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A Mendocino County Superior Court jury awarded $12.6 million to two
former State Farm Insurance agents blocked from selling competing
policies to former customers after State Farm fired them in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   After concluding State Farm acted with malice toward former agents
John W. Wier and Richard L. Pyorre, the jury late Monday decided
State Farm should pay $6 million in punitive damages to the men.</LD>
<LD>   The punitive damages supplement a $6.6-million award granted to
the men in a jury verdict reached late last week.</LD>
<TE>   The jury determined State Farm should pay $3.25 million to Wier
and $3.35 million to Pyorre to compensate them for lost commissions
and emotional distress.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like we got our reputations back," Pyorre said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   He had been a State Farm agent for 27 years in the Mendocino
County town of Fort Bragg until the insurer fired him in February
1999 for missing a mandatory ethics class.</TE>
<TE>   Wier, a former State Farm agent for 12 years in Del Norte County's
Crescent City, couldn't be reached Monday.</TE>
<TE>   State Farm "will review the decision to figure out what our
options may be," said spokesman Bill Sirola. "We really regret this
issue had to end up in court."</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Richard Henderson scheduled an Oct. 11
hearing to review the verdict and damages.</TE>
<TE>   The verdict, handed out in a courtroom about 120 miles north of
San Francisco, is a blow for State Farm.</TE>
<TE>   The Bloomington, Ill.-based company had been feuding with the two
agents since firing them in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The carrier sued the former agents in 2000, alleging the men had
engaged in economic espionage by drawing on information they
collected while working as State Farm agents to sell policies for
Mercury Insurance.</TE>
<TE>   State Farm argued that all policyholder information collected by
its sales agents constitutes company-owned trade secrets.</TE>
<TE>   Though agreeing the policyholder files were valuable to State
Farm, the jury decided by a 10-2 vote that the information didn't
necessarily belong to the company.</TE>

<LD>Sprint Corp. said its banks will revise the terms of as much as $1.1
billion in loans secured by money customers owe, reducing the
likelihood that the company might have to repay them early.</LD>
<LD>   The terms of Sprint's previous loans required that at least $250
million be repaid early if Moody's Investors Service or Standard &amp;
Poor's cut Sprint's rating to junk level. The ratings companies
downgraded Sprint, the third-largest U.S. long-distance telephone
provider, to their lowest investment-grade level in June.</LD>

<LD>Vivendi Universal's video game unit is launching a publishing label
to target older audiences. Black Label Games seeks to tap into a
growing group of gamers in their 20s and 30s.</LD>
<LD>   Since "Grand Theft Auto 3," an action game with a Mafia story
line, became last year's unexpected runaway hit, publishers are
focusing more on edgier games.</LD>
<LD>   Black Label will publish three mature titles this year, including
"The Thing," "Enclave" and "The Lord of the Rings."</LD>

<HD>Titan's Loss Widens on SureBeam Spinoff Costs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Titan Corp. on Monday reported a wider second-quarter net loss as the
defense contractor incurred costs to spin off its money-losing
SureBeam Corp. food treatment unit.</LD>
<LD>   The loss widened to $11.8 million, or 16 cents a share, from $7.8
million, or 16 cents, a year earlier, Titan said. Sales rose 55% to
$399.9 million.</LD>
<LD>   Titan last week spun off SureBeam, which irradiates food to kill
harmful bacteria, to focus on selling communications networks to the
military. The San Diego firm had a loss from discontinued operations
of $11.1 million in the quarter related to SureBeam.</LD>
<TE>   Excluding early retirement of debt, amortization, deferred
compensation, the sale of a business and other costs, Titan said it
would have had a profit of $7.8 million, or 9 cents a share. On that
basis, the company matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed
by Thomson First Call. Titan shares rose 24 cents to $11.23 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Trading Gains Allure</HD>
<DH>Fed up with advice to stay put, some investors are looking
to make a quicker buck</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ninfa Fabila, a 52-year-old nurse from Los Angeles, watched her
401(k) retirement savings account lose half its value before she
pulled the money out of the stock market at the end of last year.</LD>
<LD>   Now, she's looking for a way to boost her retirement nest egg
without relying on buy-and-hold investing in shares. Instead, Fabila
wants to learn how to trade the market, she said.</LD>
<LD>   "Right now I would not risk my money buying and holding stocks,"
Fabila said. "It's the traders who are doing well. The sellers are
making a lot of profit by 'shorting' stocks," she said, referring to
a strategy that profits when stocks go down.</LD>
<TE>   Fabila was one of several thousand attendees at the fourth annual
International Online Trading Expo at the Anaheim Convention Center
over the weekend, where vendors touted systems and strategies aimed
largely at people who are interested in making short-term profits in
the market--and in avoiding the heavy losses that can be an
inevitable element of buy-and-hold investing.</TE>
<TE>   The grueling bear market of the last 29 months has left more
investors fed up with the advice they heard consistently in the
1990s--to just stay put in the market for the long term.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, predictions by some market pros that stocks
could be stuck in a trading range--rallying periodically, then
falling back, and making little net progress over a period of
years--has burnished the idea that active trading may be a smarter
strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it's easier said than done to master the art of buying
low and selling high. Many financial advisors continue to warn that
small investors who try to trade the market may find it's just as
costly as buy-and-hold investing has been recently, or more so.
Timing decisions, transaction costs and tax considerations are among
the many hurdles traders face.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some attendees at the Anaheim show said disillusionment
with professional financial advisors has inspired them to try on
their own to learn how to to make money in up markets or in down
markets.</TE>
<TE>   "All my experiences with brokers have been bad," said Mark Brown,
a 37-year-old lock designer from San Diego. "That's what has pushed
me to get educated."</TE>
<TE>   Said Marvin Fineman, 66, a retired dentist from Laguna Beach:
"I've searched all over the globe for a money manager to handle my
portfolio, only to find that one was worse than the other. When the
markets are dangerous you should be out [of stocks], but the
professional mutual fund managers have been in it all the way down."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, many attendees said they were looking for more than
strategy ideas for picking stocks to ride higher. Many also were
interested in how to profit when stocks drop, such as by "short
selling" (selling borrowed shares) and by using "put" option
contracts, for example.</TE>
<TE>   Conference organizer Tim Bourquin said attendance has held steady
at the four-day event, which he said drew 3,700 this year, because
"people are looking at their returns and wondering if there is a
better way. Trading might make sense, at least with a small portion
of your money."</TE>
<TE>   But the show's emphasis has changed, Bourquin said. When he and
his partner launched the event in 1999, near the height of the bull
market, it was known as the International Day Trading Expo.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Day trading' has never been able to get away from the stigma of
the get-rich-quick idea, even though the notion that you could take
$10,000 and end up living on an island was never really true,"
Bourquin said.</TE>
<TE>   Many amateur traders today say they are looking for strategies to
play market or individual stock moves lasting at least several days,
not the minute-by-minute moves that day traders try to ride.</TE>
<TE>   One popular strategy now is "swing trading," in which stocks are
held for at least several days once they start to move higher. That
appeals to investors who don't have time to watch hour-by-hour price
moves. "As a nurse it's hard for me to be in front of a computer all
day," Fabila said.</TE>
<TE>   The trick of trading, naturally, is to know when to get into an
investment, and when to get out. That's why many investors look for
some kind of disciplined system that can help them take the emotion
out of trading decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Terrence Brown, a 47-year-old respiratory therapist from San
Bernardino, said he swing-trades stocks and index funds based on his
reading of price and volume chart patterns known by names such as
"Bollinger bands," "cup and handle" formations and "head and
shoulders" formations.</TE>
<TE>   Swing traders have become so common that one exhibitor joked, "A
swing trader is a guy who gets it wrong and is waiting for the market
to swing back in the other direction."</TE>
<TE>   Experienced traders say the volatile market of recent years has
taught them many lessons.</TE>
<TE>   Elton Barton of Sun City, who was promoting his Turning Points
Advisory Service, said he has been making smaller and less frequent
trades because of the market's swings, to better control the risks.</TE>
<TE>   Terrence Brown, who described himself as a "semi-professional"
trader, said he has learned to limit his downside risk by using
"stops," or orders to sell automatically if a stock dips to a certain
price.</TE>
<TE>   Wild market swings also have reinforced an investing lesson when
trades go well, Brown said: "Protect your profits and don't get
greedy."</TE>
<TE>   Stuart Townsend of Chicago-based Townsend Analytics Ltd., an
exhibitor promoting its RealTick research and trading platform, said
simple "momentum" investing--buying what's hot at the moment--became
a bear market casualty.</TE>
<TE>   "This used to be all about making money off the new IPO or the hot
tech stock of the day, but today's market is so much choppier,"
Townsend said. "There's a much greater emphasis on education at these
shows. Two years ago, everybody just wanted to get in to make money
instantly, but now they view it as a commitment."</TE>
<TE>   Townsend said traders understand that they can't ride the bull
market to easy profit anymore; instead, they may need to learn
complex, riskier techniques such as shorting to thrive, he said.</TE>
<TE>   More traders also are studying the nuances of industry sector
analysis to try to gain an edge, he said. That entails learning how
economic or other forces affecting one industry may also affect
another. The key is to learn how to pick strong stock sectors and
avoid, or short, those that are weakening.</TE>
<TE>   James Curley, an exhibitor with Chicago-based Non-Linear
Technologies, agreed. "The theme is back to basics," he said. "The
guy who was driving a cab and heard about trading from a friend,
thinking he could get rich, is gone."</TE>
<TE>   Fabila, who said she flamed out in a brief swing-trading foray
last year, stopped by the Irvine-based Online Trading Academy's booth
and signed up for a one-week boot camp in September. She hopes to
make a more serious run at it after graduating.</TE>
<TE>   "Trading coaches," who help people cope with emotional issues such
as the stress of losing money, also have become fashionable, Townsend
said.</TE>
<TE>   Adrienne Toghraie of Cary, N.C., who charges $7,500 for two days
of one-on-one coaching plus a year of phone and e-mail follow-ups,
said many would-be traders "are grappling with their fears."</TE>
<TE>   Professional traders say it's important to understand that some
losses are inevitable in trading. The key, they say, is to limit
losses, and to learn not to look back but to focus on the next trade.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the seeming allure of trading, some attendees could only
glance around the exhibit hall and chuckle at the hardware, software
and services on display.</TE>
<TE>   "If there were a system that worked on any consistent basis, they
wouldn't be out here selling all this stuff," Fineman said. "They'd
be using it themselves instead."</TE>
<TE>   But to longtime traders such as Terrence Brown, using part of a
portfolio to play the market makes more sense than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "Trading is more lucrative," Brown said. He said he has made money
in the long run through trading, although he has kept his day job and
endured the inevitable slumps.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of stocks have dropped, but if you trade smartly you can
make money either way the market goes," he said. "If you're a
buy-and-hold investor, it might take another 10 years before you get
even."</TE>

<HD>Port Workers Protest Possible U.S. Intervention</HD>
<DH>Labor: The ILWU and Pacific Maritime Assn. have not been
able to agree on a contract, which expired July 1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN and NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the federal government threatening to get involved in contract
talks between port workers and shipping firms, the International
Longshore and Warehouse Union on Monday decided it was time to march.</LD>
<LD>   Carrying signs that said "Fight Terrorism, Not American Workers,"
about 2,000 union members strode through downtown Long Beach to
protest federal plans for bringing in federal troops to run the
nation's busiest harbor complex should the two sides fail to reach an
agreement.</LD>
<LD>   The contract, which covers more than 10,500 union members at 29
West Coast ports handling 7% of the U.S. gross domestic product,
expired July 1.</LD>
<TE>   Since then, the union and the Pacific Maritime Assn., which
represents shipping lines and stevedoring companies, have been unable
to reach a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations resume today in San Francisco, after a three-week
break called by the union after its members rejected an offer from
the shipping lines.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's threat to intervene has become a major
point of contention. The White House convened a working group to
monitor port talks in June, with representatives from the departments
of Labor, Commerce, Transportation and Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   A Labor Department official who has been in touch with the union
and shipping lines confirmed last week that he had discussed four
options that might come into play if the union called a strike,
including forcing union members to work through an 80-day cooling-off
period or using Navy personnel to operate port equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking on condition that he not be identified, the official
insisted the administration has been neutral but is worried that a
port strike could cripple the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The union responded Monday by sponsoring rallies in five port
communities from Portland, Ore., to San Diego, which drew half a
dozen mayors, including Willie Brown of San Francisco and Jerry Brown
of Oakland, as well as Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.),
who spoke in Portland.</TE>
<TE>   The march in Long Beach culminated in a demonstration at Lincoln
Park attended by supporters, who included Los Angeles City
Councilwoman Janice Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot allow the heavy hand of the Bush administration to come
in here and in any way change the outcome of the negotiations," Hahn
told the appreciative crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "There's only one reason they would want to get involved at all,"
Hahn said, "and that's to break the union. We will not let that
happen."</TE>
<TE>   Union officials and rank-and-file members agreed, saying that U.S.
intervention would give shippers an unfair advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "Why should the PMA even want to settle with us if federal troops
are standing behind them?" said Roxanne Lawrence, an ILWU marine
clerk for 15 years. "It's not fair and it's not right."</TE>
<TE>   Added Lawrence: "Dispatching the National Guard to the ports in
the name of national security would be an absolute mess."</TE>
<TE>   From a stage erected in the shadow of PMA's Long Beach
headquarters, Dominic Maretti, a Los Angeles Harbor Commission
liaison for the union, said port workers would never endanger
national security and reminded the crowd that, even in times of labor
strife, longshore workers have done their part for the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "This union has a long-standing policy," he said. "During a
strike, we move all military goods, troops and passengers."</TE>
<TE>   Rhetoric has grown tense in the last week, with each side claiming
the other is not bargaining seriously. Key differences are the
introduction of labor-saving technology and union concerns about
outsourcing jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn. has called for professional mediation
unless it sees "hard bargaining" at the table today.</TE>
<TE>   "If the union comes in with a proposal and I see any room at all
for us to begin to get into real serious negotiations, then we can
move forward," said PMA President Joseph Miniace.</TE>
<TE>   Union spokesman Steve Stallone said members of the union
negotiating team met Monday afternoon to discuss a new proposal.
However, he said they were unlikely to agree to mediation as long as
Bush administration officials hold out the prospect of intervention
in the event of a strike.</TE>
<TE>   The AFL-CIO executive council last week pledged its support to the
longshore union and called for no intervention. The Los Angeles City
Council also voted to ask the Bush administration to remain outside
the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "Our contention is that we've never yet had an opportunity to sit
down with just the two parties. We've always had a third party
lurking in the background," said Stallone, referring to
administration officials. "I think it's possible to come to an
agreement if there's no intervention."</TE>

<HD>Vivendi May Write Down Media Assets</HD>
<DH>Media: The company reportedly will take a reduction worth
billions on some entertainment units, giving it a loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal is expected to take a multibillion-dollar
write-down on some of its core entertainment assets, the latest in a
summer-long series of bad-news announcements by the beleaguered
French media and utility giant.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi declined to comment on the matter, but Vivendi Chairman
Jean-Rene Fourtou reportedly will announce a write-down of $5 billion
to $10 billion, stemming in part from Internet and television assets
acquired in December when Vivendi purchased the entertainment assets
of USA Networks.</LD>
<LD>   Although Vivendi will show a slight increase in overall sales and
earnings when it releases second-quarter earnings Wednesday, the
declining value of those media assets means the company will report a
net loss for the quarter, sources close to the company said.</LD>
<TE>   It marks Vivendi's second write-down this year: In April, the
company wrote off about $17 billion against first-quarter earnings.</TE>
<TE>   The optional accounting move, according to analysts, reduces some
of the uncertainty about the value of the company as it struggles to
restructure itself into a smaller, leaner, more cohesive entity. But
it also decreases the value of the assets it seeks to sell to reduce
its $19-billion debt.</TE>
<TE>   With significant questions about the future of the company
unanswered, Vivendi's share price continues to be depressed.
Speculation about the write-down sent Vivendi shares, already off 70%
for the year, down 57 cents to $15.68 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   With the declining market value of AOL Time Warner Inc., Vivendi
and Walt Disney Co., among other media companies, the write-down does
not surprise analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "The market is valuing media assets roughly a third lower than
when Vivendi Universal bought USA Networks," Sanford C. Bernstein &amp;
Co. analyst Michael Nathanson said.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's financial problems are the legacy of former Chief
Executive Jean-Marie Messier, who sought in recent years to transform
the French water and sewer utility company into a media powerhouse by
feverishly buying media properties, including Universal Studios.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, Messier bought USA Networks' entertainment assets
for $10.3 billion. As part of that deal, USA Networks Chairman Barry
Diller agreed to become chairman of Vivendi Universal Entertainment,
a unit including Universal's movie, television and theme park units.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, it was a pretty good value for Vivendi," said Paul
Kim, an analyst with Kaufman Bros. Only in retrospect, with the
declining value in media properties, Kim said, does it look too good
for Diller and not so good for Vivendi.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou has said the company plans to sell major assets to reduct
debt. He has not, however, said precisely which assets will be sold
or when.</TE>
<TE>   "There is value in the company," Nathanson said. It's just not
clear yet whether Fourtou plans to build or dismantle Vivendi, he
added.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, executives at Vivendi's U.S. entertainment
units--Vivendi Universal Entertainment and Universal Music--expect
Fourtou to sell those units, potentially to the public in a new stock
offering this year or next year.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the assets expected to be devalued this week, including
Universal's television production unit as well as the USA and Sci-Fi
cable networks, operate within Diller's unit.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the company indicated it plans to sell its video-game
unit with offices in Northern California, Universal City and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou has been more forthright about the assets the company does
not plan to sell.</TE>
<TE>   Citing regulatory concerns, he has stated he does not foresee
reducing the company's European water and sewage holdings, the
centuries-old foundation of the company.</TE>
<TE>   He has told Vivendi's U.S. publishing unit, Houghton Mifflin, that
the company plans to keep it as well.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou this summer announced plans to sell off unprofitable
divisions of the company's European pay television unit, Canal Plus.
But the highly respected, and profitable, French division will remain
part of Vivendi, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In anticipation of this week's earnings announcement, half a dozen
analysts surveyed by Reuters forecast Vivendi's second-quarter sales
from media and communications at an average of about $7.5 billion, up
from $6.5 billion a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or
EBITDA, is pegged at about $1.4 billion versus nearly $1.3 billion a
year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the net result would be so distorted by the expected
write-down that they saw little point in drawing up forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate development Monday, a class-action lawsuit was filed
against Vivendi in U. S. District Court for the Southern District of
New York on behalf of Vivendi securities holders from April 23, 2001,
to July 2, 2002.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint, filed by law firm Berger &amp; Montague, alleges that
the company issued materially false and misleading statements,
artificially inflating the market price of Vivendi's securities.</TE>

<HD>Ex-CEO Waksal Pleads Not Guilty</HD>
<DH>Courts: The ImClone founder speaks for the first time since
his arrest. Two possible trial dates are set.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>ImClone Systems Inc. founder and former Chief Executive Samuel D.
Waksal pleaded not guilty Monday to insider trading, bank fraud,
perjury and obstruction-of-justice charges in connection with an
alleged scheme to dump shares of the company days before regulators
rejected its highly touted new cancer drug.</LD>
<LD>   Monday's indictment included last week's allegations by a federal
grand jury of destroying documents, lying to investigators and
putting up the same collateral for two different bank loans.</LD>
<LD>   After his arraignment, he spoke publicly for the first time since
his arrest June 12, reading a statement to dozens of reporters
outside the federal courthouse in lower Manhattan.</LD>
<TE>   "My attorneys and I look forward to addressing these charges in
the appropriate forum, the courts," Waksal said.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever happens to me, I know that this breakthrough therapy
will one day make a real difference in the lives of many gravely ill
people."</TE>
<TE>   The 54-year-old Waksal is accused of tipping off relatives that
the Food and Drug Administration turned down the company's
application for Erbitux, an experimental cancer drug, days before the
news was made public. Waksal's father and daughter alone sold
millions of dollars' worth of company stock in that time, authorities
said, with family stock sales totaling $10 million before the Dec. 28
announcement sent the stock tumbling. The resulting scandal also has
ensnared Waksal's friend Martha Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, the chief executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
Inc., is the target of an insider trading investigation for her sale
of 3,928 ImClone shares Dec. 27, the day before the news about
Erbitux was released. She has denied wrongdoing and refused last week
to answer questions on the matter before a congressional committee.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has been given until Aug. 20 to provide the House Energy
and Commerce Committee with additional documents, said Ken Johnson, a
spokesman for the panel. "Anything that has not been turned over
voluntarily will be subpoenaed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Jim Greenwood, a Pennsylvania Republican on the committee,
told CNN's "Late Edition" that Stewart "has been less than candid
with us and with others with whom she's talked on the matter."</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood predicted that the panel probably would have to subpoena
her. "We can't sweep something like this under the rug just because
Martha Stewart is a celebrity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the FDA announcement, Martha Stewart Living shares have
dropped almost 59%. The stock was up 30 cents at $6.99 in trading on
the New York Stock Exchange. ImClone shares were up 68 cents to close
at $8.02 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had sought unsuccessfully to arrange a plea deal that
would have forced Waksal to reveal, in exchange for leniency, whether
he provided insider trading tips to family and friends, including
Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   Appearing in court Monday, Waksal said only "not guilty." He was
silent as a prosecutor detailed the charges to U.S. District Judge
William Pauley.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an extremely simple and straightforward case," said
Assistant U.S. Atty. Michael Schachter. The judge said Waksal's trial
would begin Dec. 9 or Feb. 10, depending on how long lawyers take to
prepare the case and on the judge's schedule.</TE>
<TE>   In his statement outside the court, Waksal didn't address the
charges directly. Instead, the former CEO of ImClone spoke about the
company and what once was its most promising drug.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that the drug Erbitux, which I have worked to bring to
the public for over 10 years, has the potential to help millions of
cancer patients," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He also told reporters that the case had been "extremely
challenging and emotionally draining for me, my family and my
friends."</TE>
<TE>   "I founded ImClone in order to discover important new drugs to
meet unmet medical needs of society," he added. "ImClone itself is a
strong, solid company whose scientists and other employees have
devoted themselves to achieving a noble goal."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors offered a glimpse of their evidence against Waksal at
Monday morning's hearing. It includes 70 boxes of documents, many
relating to ImClone's application to the FDA for Erbitux approval.
Schachter said the government hadn't seized any property from Waksal
and that the ex-CEO made no incriminating statements after his
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Schachter asked for a quick trial, estimating the case would take
three to four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   He said he'd "rather not comment" when asked by Pauley whether the
government would be filing charges against another person, or
additional charges against Waksal.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Mark Pomerantz disputed Schachter's assertion that
the case was straightforward, telling Pauley, "It seems a bit more
complicated." Pomerantz also said he might not remain Waksal's
lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal is free on $10 million bond, secured by $5 million in cash.
If convicted, he could face 30 years in prison on the bank fraud
charge alone.</TE>

<HD>Schwab to Cut 375 Jobs, Shut Call Center</HD>
<DH>Investing: Brokerage seeks to lower expenses by $200
million annually as revenue shrinks in a down market. More firings
are expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Slumping online stock brokerage Charles Schwab Corp. will resort to
more mass layoffs after concluding that the dismal market conditions
are unlikely to improve this year.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco-based company said Monday that it will eliminate
300 jobs by closing an Austin, Texas-based call center and will prune
75 jobs from other call centers in Denver, Indianapolis, Phoenix and
Orlando, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   More firings will occur after management spends the next one to
two months mapping out ways to lower operating expenses by $200
million annually. Besides saving money by shrinking its payroll,
Schwab said it probably will spend less on advertising and other
discretionary items.</LD>
<TE>   Schwab's reorganization represents another major step backward for
a once hard-charging business that cashed in on the online trading
boom during the bull market of the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   As the bear market took hold in 2000, investors retreated and
Schwab's revenue began to shrivel. To cushion the blow to its profit,
Schwab already has reduced its work force by 27%, or 7,200 jobs,
since the end of 2000. The company employed 19,100 workers as of June
30.</TE>
<TE>   Schwab's latest cuts stem from a belief that investors are
unlikely to regain their confidence in the scandal-plagued stock
market any time soon, said Charles Schwab, the company's founder and
co-chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Like many other stock brokerages, Schwab is struggling to figure
out the appropriate staff to carry in a volatile market that is being
driven by wild mood swings.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's announcement followed a relatively busy month for Schwab.
The company averaged 156,100 commission trades a day in July, a 26%
increase from the same time last year.</TE>
<TE>   The surge in business proved short-lived. Customer activity during
the first week of August fell back to an average of 124,000
commission trades--about the same sluggish pace of May and June,
Schwab said.</TE>
<TE>   Schwab shares fell 11 cents to $8.46 on the New York Stock
Exchange before the cutbacks were announced.</TE>

<HD>State Officials Urge Corporate Reform</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Financial officials of more than a dozen states met in New York on
Monday to reiterate their pledge to pressure Wall Street and
corporate America to reform some of their most controversial business
practices.</LD>
<LD>   The officials, including the comptroller of New York and the
treasurers of California and North Carolina, said they will try to
force investment banks to reduce stock-analyst conflicts of interest
and will pressure other types of companies to improve
corporate-governance procedures.</LD>
<LD>   The officials also pledged to turn up the heat on companies that
set up offshore headquarters to dodge U.S. taxes.</LD>
<TE>   The state treasurers and pension fund managers control more than
$1 trillion in assets, thus giving them clout in their campaign, they
said. "We're going to use the power of the purse," California
Treasurer Phil Angelides said.</TE>
<TE>   But some experts criticized the group's plans as vague and said
it's doubtful that threats of stock sales from pension funds, or
withheld contracts by states (such as for bond underwriting), could
force meaningful reform among brokerages and companies.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the primary focus of the states has been to ask
investment banks to abide by stock-analyst conflict-of-interest rules
that were part of brokerage giant Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s settlement
this year with New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer.</TE>
<TE>   But it would be hard for the states to monitor compliance and
would be a potentially cumbersome process to cease doing business
with a firm that violated the guidelines, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "To say, 'We'll withhold money from people who do stuff we don't
like' is fine, but how do you know when people are doing stuff you
don't like?" said Thomas Joo, a corporate-governance expert at UC
Davis Law School.</TE>
<TE>   Also, though states are sharing information with one another, the
officials said they would not make decisions in tandem on selling
certain stocks out of their pension funds, or ceasing business with
certain investment banks. Thus, one state's decision against using a
certain Wall Street firm would not automatically apply to other
states.</TE>
<TE>   The states represented at Monday's meeting were California, New
York, North Carolina, Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Louisiana, New Jersey, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon.</TE>

<LD>And her ratings are huge too. "The Anna Nicole Show," the latest
"reality TV" program, was the highest-rated show in the history of
the E! network when it premiered on Aug. 4. Now, why is that?</LD>
<LD>   The critics, of course, don't love it. The New York Daily News'
David Bianculi derided it as "a train wreck--with breasts." The Los
Angeles Times' Howard Rosenberg called Smith "less blond bombshell
than shell." The Washington Post's Ken Ringle wrote that watching
Smith's show was "like a trip to the vomitorium." The Dallas Morning
News' Ed Bark took the show as proof that "Western civilization has
finally thrown in the towel."</LD>
<LD>   Why, oh why, are the media so outraged? After all, the pundits
were kinder to an earlier reality show, "The Osbournes." But that
pseudo-sitcom crept up on the critics over the last five months; it
started life in March with modest ratings, only later exploding into
popular consciousness. And besides, Ozzy Osbourne is British, which
is always a positive in the minds of American scribblers, who suffer
from perpetual England envy. By contrast, Ms. Smith hails from Mexia,
Texas; Southern whites make up the one group that it's still
politically correct to make fun of.</LD>
<TE>   OK, so the show's not for everyone. But still, why do so many
people watch? What is it that the American people see in reality
shows?</TE>
<TE>   The answer, maybe, is that they see themselves. The contestants on
"Survivor" or "Big Brother" or ABC's forthcoming free-plastic-surgery
show, "Ultimate Makeover," may not be exactly average, but surely
they are more typical than the coiffed, tanned, buffed and
voice-coached would-be icons who get on TV to deliver comedy, tragedy
or the news every day.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, meanwhile, is an undereducated, overweight single mother,
in some ways not so different from millions of Americans. But whoa,
what about the bleached-blond hair and the silicone-implanted
breasts?</TE>
<TE>   Those are real too. Real bleach, real implants. So even on the
cosmetic enhancement front, are Smith's beauty tricks so rare
anymore?</TE>
<TE>   In other words, maybe "Anna Nicole" and the other reality shows
are, in their own cracked fashion, a bid for truth. That was a point
made by the comedian David Brenner in a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   Brenner has been a star since the early 1970s, but he was candid
in acknowledging that in the '80s his fan base shrank as he got
older. One problem was his determination to keep his act "clean"--no
vulgar words.</TE>
<TE>   That clean-talking policy endeared him to some folks but not
enough of them, Brenner concluded, especially young ones. The younger
set felt it wasn't "honest" not to use the language of everyday
life--of reality, coarse as it might be. And so, starting in 1990,
Brenner started in with the salty talk, and his career bounced back.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone will applaud his decision, of course, but one should
at least give him credit for knowing what works in the comedy biz.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about sex in the media, Brenner had the same answer: Young
audiences expect frank treatment of sex because it's "part of real
life." OK, he was asked, what don't young people want?</TE>
<TE>   "What's bad is hypocrisy and lying," he answered. Such
artificiality, he added, is what young people expect from television,
and it's a turnoff for them.</TE>
<TE>   So if young people are rejecting the traditional media as
hypocritical and untruthful, reality shows are picking up the
slackers' slack. As Broadcasting &amp; Cable reported, "Another coup for
E!: Smith's audience is youthful." No wonder Electronic Media reports
that the News Corp. is considering an entire new 24/7 network devoted
to the reality genre.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the only competition to reality shows might be ... reality
itself.</TE>
<TE>   The rescue of the Pennsylvania coal miners last month made for
compelling TV; Hollywooders moved right in and snapped up their life
stories. And the spectacle of the two Lancaster, Calif., teens who
were abducted, raped, freed--and then booked on a slew of shows--has
made for its own kind of raw realness.</TE>
<TE>   One need not admire such programming to respect the impulse behind
it. Americans may have a turn for trash, but they have a hankering
for honesty too. Anna Nicole Smith may be a big fake, but if
audiences, especially the young, think she's more real than standard
network programming, old-style media face an even bigger problem than
Anna Nicole's busting out.</TE>

<HD>Dirty Dealings? Bush Is Shocked ... Shocked!</HD>
<DH>His friends helped create corporate America's mess.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last week, speaking in Mississippi near the corporate headquarters of
the now bankrupt and disgraced WorldCom, President Bush consoled
fired workers with his shopworn canard that the loss of their jobs
was the result of "shady corporate practices" that deeply shocked
him.</LD>
<LD>   This naivete, if not feigned, reflects an embarrassing stupidity
about how he and his corporate buddies played the capitalism game
during the last decade.</LD>
<LD>   Companies like WorldCom and Enron were not a natural manifestation
of the free-market capitalism celebrated by the likes of Adam Smith.
The corporate manipulators of the market that we are now seeing were
precisely the enemy of the "invisible hand" celebrated in Smith's
economics classic, "The Wealth of Nations"; they betrayed the solid
post-Great Depression regulatory foundation designed by President
Franklin D. Roosevelt to prevent large corporations from subverting
the integrity of the free market.</LD>
<TE>   The fervent deregulators of the last two decades were not
interested in a truly free market in which profit is dictated by
consumers choosing what they want to buy. On the contrary, although
government interference in the economy was corporate America's most
convenient scapegoat for its failures, this was also exactly what it
wanted. Regulations that suited its purposes were just fine.
Corporate America was very much against government action to protect
the environment, consumers, the poor or even shareholders trying to
read annual reports, but it had no compunction about buying
legislative loopholes that the clumsiest of con artists could jump
through.</TE>
<TE>   Without such loopholes, snake-oil salesmen would not have been
able to transform Enron--a small energy company affected by logical
legal restraints on utilities--into the dominant manipulator of the
U.S. energy market before it became a flaming wreck.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, WorldCom was only a minor player until the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, pushed through Congress by Rep. Newt
Gingrich and Sen. Trent Lott and signed into law with the
enthusiastic support of corporation-friendly "New Democrat" President
Clinton. At the behest of lobbyists for WorldCom--based in Lott's
home state of Mississippi--the senator stuck in an amendment
specifically designed to enable WorldCom to grab a huge chunk of the
telephone market.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, WorldCom was lagging badly behind the big three
long-distance carriers. Lott's legalese, however, turned this to the
company's advantage by specifying that only companies--such as
WorldCom--with 5% or less of the long-distance market could enter
into joint marketing agreements with local phone service suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   The firm was thus free to buy MFS Communications, then the top
alternative provider of local phone services, for $12.4 billion and
became the first company to provide both local and long distance
since deregulation forced the breakup of the Bell system.</TE>
<TE>   Lott was rewarded for his efforts with major contributions from
WorldCom to him and other GOP politicians who had propelled him into
the top leadership position in the Senate. WorldCom also granted a
cool million to help underwrite the Trent Lott Leadership Institute,
which presumably will train future politicians to comply with the
wishes of corporate lobbyists.</TE>
<TE>   Thus was born the overreaching, out-of-control and fundamentally
dishonest corporation that is now in bankruptcy after conceding false
accounting of more than $7 billion. Bush condemns such
irresponsibility without ever daring to examine its roots. Is he
clueless, or is it that he just doesn't want to know?</TE>
<TE>   Bush was in Mississippi not just to console the WorldCommers but
to help raise a quick half-million dollars for the campaign of Rep.
Charles W. "Chip" Pickering, the Republican candidate for reelection
who "represents" many of the fired WorldCom workers. Pickering got
that job after being an aide to Lott on the very telecommunications
issues that favored WorldCom, which returned the favor with $80,000
in contributions to Pickering.</TE>
<TE>   When Bush said, "I met WorldCom employees who no longer have work,
who are disillusioned like me and others about the corporate fraud
which is taking place in our country," it might have provided comic
relief if the president had turned to Pickering and Lott and asked
them whether they were now sorry for creating this monster. Or maybe
not; the risk is that they might have turned the question back on
Bush in pointed reference to his own sordid history of business
shenanigans.</TE>

<HD>The Justice-at-a-Price Guys Take Aim at Arbitration</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM K. SLATE II</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under the guise of "consumer advocacy," a small group of trial
lawyers is waging a well-financed legislative campaign that would
make it much harder for some people to get access to justice in
California. Legislators must defeat the measures, which are headed
for final votes in the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Dispute resolution services--including arbitration, mediation and
conciliation--offer individuals and businesses a way to resolve
disputes quickly, fairly and cost-effectively outside of court. In
California, these services are well regulated and supported by the
courts. For many Californians, alternative dispute resolution is
their only chance to be heard.</LD>
<LD>   Arbitration is especially important because the right to trial by
jury is increasingly available only to those who have unlimited
resources to spend on years of litigation or those who have
spectacular, headline-worthy claims.</LD>
<TE>   The high cost of justice shuts out as many as 100 million
Americans from the legal system, according to the American Bar Assn.
A survey of employment lawyers indicated that a prospective plaintiff
needed to have a minimum of $60,000 in provable damages before an
attorney would even take a case. Moreover, in our already
overburdened civil justice system, it takes an average of 2 1/2 years
for a case to get to a jury--if it gets there at all.</TE>
<TE>   Arbitration has provided an alternative to this slow and expensive
justice system. Currently, under procedures established by the
American Arbitration Assn., a not-for-profit, public service
organization, the total fee charged to the individual in a
business-to-individual arbitration is $125 for claims under $10,000;
or half of the arbitrator's fee, capped at a maximum of $375, for
claims between $10,000 and $75,000. If the case is settled before a
hearing, the individual pays no fee.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, appearing without an attorney in arbitration is much
easier than in litigation, as the parties do not have to navigate the
evidentiary hurdles, motions and discovery that often define court
proceedings. This allows many people to represent themselves and
avoid lawyers' fees. If need can be proved, the arbitration services
are offered for reduced amounts or for no fee at all.</TE>
<TE>   But the measures proposed by a few trial attorneys, if passed and
signed into law by Gov. Gray Davis, would create roadblocks that
would make arbitration impractical. These roadblocks include exposing
those who provide arbitration services to lawsuits if one of the
parties isn't pleased with the outcome (judges are immune from such
lawsuits) and forcing the organization that provides arbitration
services--rather than the business involved in the dispute--to bear
the costs of the procedure if the individual is unable to pay.</TE>
<TE>   The system of alternative dispute resolution in California is not
without its flaws. But the overreaching legislation proposed by
anti-arbitration trial lawyers to remedy these problems would create
a windfall for trial attorneys, further tax California's civil court
system and force those who cannot afford it into expensive and
lengthy litigation.</TE>

<HD>By Wading Deeper Into Afghanistan, the U.S. Could Step Into
a Big Hole</HD>

<LD>There is a joke from Kabul: Hamid Karzai, the interim head of state,
signs a document and hands it to a man sitting across from him. "Here
is the edict for your appointment to a senior position in my
government. Now it's your turn to sign a document." The new appointee
asks: "What is the document that I should sign?" Karzai replies:
"Your last will and testament."</LD>
<LD>   The joke may sound cynical, but it reflects the mood of anxiety in
Afghanistan. During the last six months, at least a dozen senior
officials have been killed, including a vice president, a Cabinet
minister and a provincial governor. The ex-king, Mohammad Zaher Shah,
and Defense Minister Mohammed Qassim Fahim have escaped assassination
attempts.</LD>
<LD>   In every case, Karzai's entourage, using leaks to the American
media, has alleged that the killings were organized by unspecified
factions within the governing coalition. Karzai is so distrustful
that he replaced his Afghan bodyguards with 72 U.S. Marines in July.</LD>
<TE>   Initially, the United States had been careful to minimize its
involvement in Afghan politics. The U.S. plan was to destroy the
terrorist organizations, kill or capture as many of the criminals as
possible, organize some form of governmental authority and then
leave. The task of leading an international stabilization force was
assigned first to the British, then to the Turks; the United Nations
was put in charge of the so-called nation-building efforts.</TE>
<TE>   By those yardsticks, the U.S. achieved its objectives in June. The
terror groups were smashed. A stabilization force was in place, and
Karzai and his Cabinet filled the role of a national authority.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, there are signs that the U.S. may be abandoning its
minimalist agenda in favor of a maximalist one that could trigger a
civil war and drag the U.S. into Afghan factional bloodletting.</TE>
<TE>   Judging by statements by Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. special envoy
to Afghanistan, U.S. action in Afghanistan is being transformed from
a limited police operation into an open-ended empire-building scheme
with geostrategic goals.</TE>
<TE>   Under this plan, the U.S. would acquire a permanent military
presence in Afghanistan and turn it into a base for projecting power
in Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East and the
Persian Gulf. A landlocked country larger than France, Afghanistan
could serve as a terrestrial aircraft carrier for U.S. military
facilities in Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan also could be used as a transit route for oil and gas
pipelines from Kazakhstan and elsewhere in Central Asia via Pakistan
and the Indian Ocean. Both Karzai and Khalilzad have worked as
consultants for U.S. oil companies that have pushed for this scheme
since 1996. A third Afghan involved, Ashref Ghani, is minister of
finance in the Karzai Cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   Some Afghans have identified Khalilzad and Ghani as the twin
eminences-grises in Kabul, with Karzai just the front man. At times
Khalilzad has stepped out of the shadows to show who is boss. Some
Afghan officials report directly to the U.S. envoy or receive his
instructions over the telephone.</TE>
<TE>   In the days immediately after Sept. 11, the U.S. acknowledged that
Afghanistan was a fragmented nation where numerous groups wielded
power with a combination of violence and bribery. The U.S. was
cautious not to side with groups that wanted to restore the monarchy
in one form or another.</TE>
<TE>   For a broader American agenda to succeed, a number of conditions
would have to be met. Chief among these is the creation of an Afghan
government capable of mobilizing public support for a long-term U.S.
military presence. Such a government is also needed for the
protection of the projected oil and gas pipelines along more than 700
kilometers of some of the most dangerous territory in the world.</TE>
<TE>   The Khalilzad-Karzai-Ghani triumvirate hopes that its ethnic
group--the Pushtuns--will dominate such a government. The problem is
that the Pushtun community, which is 38% of the population, is the
most fractured of all 18 ethnic groups in Afghanistan today. Further,
it lacks the intellectual, bureaucratic and technical elements needed
for building and running a modern centralized government.</TE>
<TE>   Western and southwestern Afghanistan, where the pipelines would
pass, are now controlled by Tajik forces and their Char-Aymaq,
Baluch, Uzbek and Turkoman allies. A recent unsuccessful attempt by
Pushtun forces to capture the air base at Shindand, seen as a future
U.S. base, showed how tough it would be to change the balance of
power among the factions.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has thus far resisted pressure to become involved in the
fighting on the side of the Pushtuns. But these things have a
diabolical logic of their own. All empires have blundered their way
into situations that they have subsequently regretted.</TE>
<TE>   Since its creation as a state in the 18th century, Afghanistan has
been a patchwork of ethnic and tribal communities with a nominal
central government in Kabul. It has been a buffer separating rival
neighboring empires. Afghanistan has always been an easy land to
conquer but the hardest to hold. A newcomer to the region, the United
States should not ignore those facts. It is, perhaps, time for the
U.S., its initial mission accomplished, to take a deep breath and
evaluate what really might happen if it stays in Afghanistan.</TE>

<LD>Bankruptcy conjures up images of torched credit ratings for ordinary
Joes and Jills, with the only benefit being an end to hounding by
creditors. But that logic can turn upside down when the bankrupt
party is a billion-dollar business, particularly one as vital to
personal and commercial life as an airline.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing announced Sunday by US
Airways Group is creating anxious moments for skittish ticket holders
and loyal passengers with big frequent-flier mileage. Those consumers
aren't likely to get burned, but the pain will worsen for
shareholders who've watched the stock price skid to $2.45 from a
52-week high of $18.32. Bankruptcy can conceivably lead to brighter
days, however. Continental Airlines, for instance, used bankruptcy to
cut costs, hone business plans and emerge stronger.</LD>
<LD>   Bankruptcy alone won't solve the industry's problems. The Air
Transportation Stabilization Board, created after Sept. 11, still has
to ensure that troubled airlines retain access to needed credit. Some
form of assistance clearly is necessary. Even before Sept. 11, US
Airways and United Airlines hoped to bolster their chances of
surviving by merging. Regulators, though, refused to bless the deal.</LD>
<TE>   Carriers have slashed flights and laid off a record number of
employees, but Southwest Airlines is the only major carrier reporting
profits. Lenders, worried that airlines won't be able to repay loans,
are balking when airline executives come knocking. This is where the
board enters the picture.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways, even in bankruptcy, seems on track to meet
requirements for federal loan guarantees. The airline has struggled
to cut costs, making it a good candidate to pay back loans that
federal guarantees would make possible. The airline negotiated $1
billion in wage and work rule concessions from its unions and plans
to use Bankruptcy Court to wring concessions from suppliers and
lenders.</TE>
<TE>   That brings us to United Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's second-largest carrier is lobbying fiercely in
Washington for loan guarantees. But the airline still has a relative
mountain of cash and has yet to attack operating costs that are among
the industry's highest.</TE>
<TE>   United's competitors are probably right in arguing that United's
first stop should be Bankruptcy Court, not the loan board. United is
in a tough spot because employees hold a majority of the airline's
shares; they must start thinking like owners and recognize the need
for painful concessions. Bankruptcy Court would force the tough
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   The airline industry lost a lot of passengers after Sept. 11, but
the terrorist hijackings only accelerated a trend. Big airlines still
struggle to match more nimble airlines like Southwest and JetBlue
Airways that move passengers at less cost--and use the savings to
undercut big airlines' ticket prices.</TE>
<TE>   Carriers that want loan guarantees should prove first that they're
cutting costs, pruning routes and shedding unnecessary
staff--including management--without compromising safety. In short,
they need to take hard steps so they can pay their bills. Airlines
that don't display that kind of determination shouldn't get
taxpayer-backed guarantees.</TE>

<LD>Democratic Party Chairman Terry McAuliffe is remodeling and expanding
a house and doing what every homeowner is warned against: He's paying
upfront, down to the wallpaper and faucets, even before the first
wall is torn down. The reason is not stupidity but an ingenious,
greedy political calculation.</LD>
<LD>   The "house" is a new Democratic Party headquarters and the funds
are unregulated campaign contributions known as soft money, which
become illegal Nov. 6, thanks to the McCain-Feingold campaign finance
bill, passed by Congress and signed by President Bush this spring.
McAuliffe, who has to spend the money before the deadline, is
disbursing $28 million in frenziedly gathered soft money to create a
spanking-new 51,000-square-foot Washington headquarters, complete
with the latest in TV and radio studios and digital capability.</LD>
<LD>   It's not that Republicans will be turning away soft money before
Nov. 6. But when Democrats are attacking the Bush administration's
big-money special interests, it is at least insensitive to, as Fred
Wertheimer of the watchdog group Democracy 21 says, "suck up every
$1-million soft-money contribution you can get your hands on." But
McAuliffe, who was on record in favor of the soft-money ban, can't
seem to help himself. During the Clinton years, no dollar was left
unchased by the man Al Gore called "the greatest fund-raiser in the
history of the universe."</LD>
<TE>   With the party headquarters, he's surpassed himself. Los Angeles
moguls Haim Saban and Stephen L. Bing opened their wallets to the
tune of $7 million and $5 million, respectively, while others like
Houston lawyer John O'Quinn kicked in a mere $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   McAuliffe is using what's about to become illegal to wage the next
fund-raising-war--for "hard"-money contributions from individual
donors who no longer can funnel unlimited sums through the parties in
a short detour to candidates they favor.</TE>
<TE>   As McAuliffe sees it, there is a kind of technology gap between
the two parties, and he's determined to close it by building an
"arsenal" of high-tech capability. The headquarters is supposed to
allow Democrats to catch up to the Republicans in terms of electronic
equipment and ability to contact potential donors on a massive scale.
Because hard-money donations are restricted to much smaller amounts
per candidate, this could substantially affect fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   The studios in the new Democratic headquarters also will be able
to quickly turn out campaign ads and feed them by satellite to local
stations.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic Party has every right to improve its fund-raising
ability, but McAuliffe's frenzy to pull in soft money until the last
moment is no credit to a party that is making much of corporate
misdeeds.</TE>

<LD>July 1. That deadline should have been triple-stamped on the
foreheads of everyone responsible in the Los Angeles Unified School
District for getting the annual student performance exams to the
testing company on time. The district blew it on nearly half the
tests, forcing the state to postpone the release of statewide scores
for two weeks and causing parents who were beginning to take a kinder
look at public schools to think again.</LD>
<LD>   Because Los Angeles is the state's largest school district, the
missing answer sheets represent 5% of the 4.5 million tests given
statewide last spring to grades two through 11. All scores must be
rerun to provide an accurate measure of statewide progress. The state
is demanding at least $50,000 from the LAUSD to cover the extra
expense. The cost to the credibility of a school district struggling
to turn around a reputation for blowing things could be even higher.</LD>
<LD>   There's no excuse. Yes, the job demanded more this year because
the state required more demographic data on students, such as family
income and education of parents. Another change forced schools to
turn in more paperwork for students who didn't take the test.
Completing this was difficult, but every other school district
managed to do it on time.</LD>
<TE>   To verify all of the forms, the LAUSD needed twice the number of
clerks it had. The district also needed a better plan, stronger
supervision and more frequent communication down to the clerks and up
to the superintendent.</TE>
<TE>   No one should scapegoat overwhelmed clerks. The blame belongs with
LAUSD management.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles schools Supt. Roy Romer stresses raising test scores
as his highest priority. He found out about the missed deadline weeks
after the fact. He promises this will never happen again. It won't,
if the top bosses are held accountable.</TE>

<HD>Smoking Out the Truth on Tobacco Tax Money</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As a nonprofit agency providing early intervention/special-needs
programs, child-care services and training for home-based child-care
providers for nearly 25 years, we at Child and Family Services
applaud the Proposition 10 Commission on its quest for universal
child care ("Tobacco Tax Might Fund Preschools," Aug. 8). The lack of
affordable, quality child care in this city is among the greatest
barriers to self-sufficiency faced by low-income families and
welfare-to-work participants. The challenge becomes even greater when
it involves a child with a learning, physical or emotional
disability.</LD>
<LD>   While we do understand the reservations of Rutgers University
professor Steven Barnett, we believe that with careful thought and
appropriate planning a program can be created here in Los Angeles
that can serve as a model for other cities. By taking steady baby
steps, the local Proposition 10 Commission can help provide an
invaluable service to the families of L.A. County through the
creation of a system allowing parents to select from a full array of
quality child-care choices.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your article on proposed tobacco tax usage to fund preschools
illustrates perfectly the abject cynicism underlying the exploitive
Proposition 10 tobacco tax and, by extension, what has driven the
whole hypocritical campaign to purportedly stamp out tobacco use to
improve society, save smokers from themselves and eliminate
"life-threatening" secondhand smoke.</TE>
<TE>   If there were any sincerity or honesty in the anti-tobacco war,
the taxes derived therefrom would be directed toward stopping
smoking, rehabilitating ex-smokers and tending to the infirmities
they and secondhand smoke inhalers are claimed to suffer. What we
have instead is greedy infighting between bureaucrats, politicians
and Rob Reiner-style do-gooders over the spoils and how to employ
them. These tax-hungry hyenas and their ilk want smoking stopped
about as much as Colombian mobsters want cocaine legalized.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson L. Forney</TE>
<TE>   Nipomo, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If Reiner is so concerned about the fate of impoverished
preschoolers, then why doesn't he start up his own charity for them?
Or perhaps he can self-fund a campaign to encourage couples not to
have kids they can't afford. I implore all California smokers to buy
their cigarettes tax-free over the Internet. It's time to put
limousine liberals like Reiner where they belong--in the peanut
gallery of political influence.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Reynolds</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I truly commend Reiner for his visionary quest to expand our
preschool programs. I believe he genuinely understands that a proper
early education is like a solid foundation on a house. I have been
teaching pre-kindergarten for the last 13 years. I realize that $1
spent today on these children might save the taxpaying public $10 in
the future.</TE>

<LD>Re "Oscar Show Could Be Split With New York in Nod to 9/11 Healing,"
Aug. 9: After reading comments by backers of the effort to bring the
Oscars to New York, it's abundantly clear that this is nothing more
than a shameless attempt to use the tragedies of Sept. 11 as an
excuse to rob Los Angeles of its rightful place as the home of the
Oscars and to promote New York as the "entertainment capital of the
world."</LD>
<LD>   If New Yorkers could have their way they'd move all of Hollywood
to Manhattan. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should
recognize this blatant boosterism for what it truly is and not allow
itself to be bullied. The Oscars belong in L.A.--the real
entertainment capital of the world.</LD>
<LD>   Trevin Hartwell</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   Share the Oscars with New York! Are you crazy? Did we get any
sympathy from the other states after the Northridge earthquake? Most
of the comments from the other states were something like, "They
deserve it--a bunch of sinners--making their porno movies out there."
Did the people who suffered after the Oklahoma City bombing get a
million apiece? The state of California is over 15% of this nation's
economy and we share that with 49 other states. Isn't that enough?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Your Aug. 6 editorial, "Holden's Dubious Legacy," calls the actions
taken to provide me with legal representation "stealth." The city was
served with the suit July 17 and my office was served July 19.
Thirteen days later the city attorney informed me his office had a
conflict of interest and my case would be referred to an attorney
from the conflict panel, who would contact me immediately. What I
wasn't told was that a response was due by Aug. 6. When I mentioned
the case to a friend who practices law, he told me that if there was
no response by Aug. 6, the plaintiff's attorney could file a default
judgment that would cost the city hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Time was running out and the attorney from the conflict panel did not
return my calls.</LD>
<LD>   I recognized this was an emergency and so did my City Council
colleagues. We were left with no choice but to introduce an emergency
motion (Rule 23) on Aug. 3. The next council meeting was Aug. 6. In
taking this "stealth" approach, as you call it, the city was saved
from a default judgment.</LD>
<TE>   Your editorial listed a number of items that could be purchased,
such as library books, if it were not for lawsuits. We celebrated the
grand opening of the Pio Pico/Koreatown Branch Library in the 10th
District last week. It's the largest branch library in the city. This
was a newsworthy event--instead of the details of one of hundreds of
lawsuits that are brought against the city every year.</TE>

<LD>"Corporate Reform: a Ship Sailing Nowhere" (Commentary, Aug. 9) is
right on! It is logical to assume that the recent wave of
executives-in-handcuffs arrests represents the tip of an iceberg.
PricewaterhouseCoopers recently paid $5 million [to settle
allegations] by the Securities and Exchange Commission but lives to
transgress another day. It stands to reason that deep within the
bowels of other accounting firms lurk Enron-like storms. If there
ever were a time for citizen activism and whistle-blowing to set
sail, it is on the current sea of big-business immorality.</LD>

<LD>Re "Military Option Has Run Its Course," Opinion, Aug. 11: Amy
Wilentz holds Prime Minister Ariel Sharon singly responsible for
violence, for "pushing [the worst elements in Palestinian society] to
new heights of cruelty." She completely overlooks the fact that the
Palestinians initiated their barbaric acts of cruelty long before
Sharon was elected. Gratuitous murder and homicide bombings began
when Israel's "peace camp" was at its zenith of influence and the
Barak government had made concessions to the Palestinians that far
exceeded the mandate it had from its own people.</LD>
<LD>   We now know that Yasser Arafat wanted more. The Palestinians
exploited Israel's withdrawal from their cities and towns to amass
weapons and build a terrorist infrastructure. Through violence, they
sought to pursue the ultimate destruction of the state of Israel.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon was elected by a frightened and alarmed Israeli electorate
in reaction to persistent and hideous terror attacks by Palestinians.
Israel is fighting a defensive war against a relentless enemy that
lacks minimum standards of human decency. Israel's cause is larger
than Wilentz's and her "peaceniks' " apparent discomfort.</LD>
<TE>   Gary L. Nudell</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I would like to ask Wilentz what she thinks the Israelis should
have done after Prime Minister Ehud Barak, at Camp David, offered the
Palestinians the best possible scenario for a Palestinian state, only
to be immediately rejected by Arafat. What happened next was a
resurgence of Palestinian violence against innocent Israeli citizens.</TE>
<TE>   What does Wilentz think the Israelis should have done? Should they
have just sat there while more and more Israelis were being killed?
No. They immediately voted Sharon in, for his aggressive tactics,
because the Israelis felt betrayed by a Palestinian leadership that
pretended to want peace when all it really wanted was all of Israel.
Barak's "peace" only prompted Arafat to launch the current intifada.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Palestinians Engender Their Own Suffering," letters, Aug. 11:
Sidney L. Strajcher writes about Palestinians "choos[ing] evil over
good" when they mount bomb attacks against their Israeli oppressors,
and Alan M. Goldberg writes about Palestinians being "guilty of
harboring terrorists." Terrorism is the only weapon the Palestinians
have for opposing the murderous Israeli military occupation of their
country, now in its 35th year.</TE>
<TE>   If a foreign power were occupying Strajcher's and Goldberg's
country--California--killing, jailing and torturing their families,
demolishing their homes, uprooting their orchards and performing
every other sort of barbarity, would these two readers sit back
calmly and do nothing? One suspects not. If they have even a fraction
of the patriotism, bravery and willingness to sacrifice themselves
for their country that the Palestinians have, they would be out
fighting.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians are using the only weapon available to them, the
suicide bomb.</TE>

<HD>Michael Houser, 40; Founding Member of Widespread Panic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Houser, the guitarist and singer who channeled a bluesy,
Southern roots sound into the improvisational performances of the
rock band Widespread Panic, has died from complications related to
pancreatic cancer. He was 40.</LD>
<LD>   The Athens, Ga., native died Saturday, according to a posting on
the band's Web site, the same forum that Houser used in July to
announce to fans that he had been diagnosed with terminal cancer.
Houser, a co-founder of the band, also sat out the Widespread Panic
summer tour, and it was unclear Monday how his death would affect the
group's future. As of Monday afternoon, the group was still scheduled
to play this weekend in Englewood, Colo.</LD>
<LD>   Widespread Panic is among the jam band culture, a subgenre of rock
that bows to the Grateful Dead tradition of emphasizing intensive
touring, improvisation in live performance and cultivating a communal
fan sensibility with an almost tribal ethos. With long, complex
songs, the jam bands are often ignored by mainstream radio, but
"Airplane," "Chilly Water" and "Can't Get High" are instantly
recognizable entries in the Panic songbook for the group's loyal
following.</LD>
<TE>   The origins of Panic trace back to the University of Georgia in
1982 when Houser and singer John Bell began collaborating. The band,
eventually a sextet, released its first album, "Space Wrangler," in
1988, and has followed that with 10 more releases, the most recent in
June called "Live in the Classic City."</TE>
<TE>   Although critics often see excess in the long solos of many jam
bands, Houser has been praised for his craft and restraint. "Houser
is apparently not deeply infected by the fusion bug, but is a steady
rock player," a Times reviewer wrote last year. "Sitting beside his
amplifiers, he sounded like a committed student of classic rock
guitar moves, more Duane Allman than aimless noodler."</TE>
<TE>   Houser is survived by his wife, Barbette, and a son, Walker. In a
statement released Sunday, the family is encouraging contributions to
the Michael Houser Music Fund, a program at Athens Academy.</TE>

<LD>Jiri Kolar, 87, a Czech poet and artist whose collages were prized by
many collectors, died Sunday in Prague. The cause of death was not
specified.</LD>
<LD>   Kolar first built a reputation in the 1940s as a groundbreaking
experimental poet.</LD>
<LD>   He worked as an editor in Prague and published five books before
his works were banned by communist authorities in 1949. He spent part
of the 1950s in prison.</LD>
<TE>   Kolar switched to the art of collage in the 1960s, producing works
that were banned in the former Czechoslovakia after the 1968 Warsaw
Pact invasion.</TE>
<TE>   He became best known for collages made from secondary material,
using reproduced images from art history and incorporating movable
parts that could be lifted.</TE>
<TE>   He emigrated to France after signing the Charter 77 human rights
manifesto, which was co-authored by the current president, Vaclav
Havel. He returned after the 1989 Velvet Revolution that toppled the
communist regime.</TE>

<LD>Lyle B. Borst, 89, a University of Chicago physicist who helped build
Brookhaven National Laboratory's nuclear reactor and was a member of
the Manhattan Project, died July 30 in Williamsville, N.Y. The cause
of death was not reported.</LD>
<LD>   He led the development of the Brookhaven Graphite Research
Reactor, the first nuclear reactor built for peacetime use, in 1950.
In its first year of operation, he announced it had produced a new
type of radioactive iodine, used to treat thyroid cancer. Studies
using the reactor also helped him explain the giant stars called
supernovae.</LD>
<LD>   He was a founding member of the Federation of Atomic Scientists,
which was created to raise awareness of the destructive potential of
nuclear energy.</LD>
<TE>   Borst, a Chicago native, earned his bachelor's and master's
degrees at the University of Illinois and his doctorate at the
University of Chicago. He worked as a researcher at the metallurgical
laboratory in Chicago, where the first self-sustaining nuclear
reaction was conducted by Dr. Enrico Fermi.</TE>
<TE>   He later taught physics at the University of Utah, New York
University and the State University of New York at Buffalo.</TE>

<HD>Doctor in Landmark Anti-Bias Case Slain</HD>
<DH>Violence: Patrick Chavis, first acclaimed and then
sanctioned, dies in a botched carjacking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To proponents of affirmative action, Patrick Chavis was viewed six
years ago as a hero. Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) called the
personable black doctor the perfect example of how the controversial
college admissions program could help minorities and disadvantaged
communities.</LD>
<LD>   To opponents of the program, Chavis was seen four years ago as one
of its failures. The Medical Board of California revoked his license,
calling him grossly negligent in his care of seven liposuction
patients, one of whom bled to death after he abandoned her bedside.</LD>
<LD>   To three street thugs, Chavis apparently looked three weeks ago
like a random target of opportunity. The 50-year-old Inglewood
resident was shot to death by the would-be carjackers as he walked
back to his Mercedes-Benz after buying an ice cream cone.</LD>
<TE>   The attackers fled without taking the car, leaving Chavis sprawled
on the pavement outside a Foster's Freeze in Hawthorne.</TE>
<TE>   Details of the crime are still sketchy and no suspects have been
identified. But a sheriff's homicide detective said that the crime
apparently had nothing to do with Chavis' past.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, it looks like the wrong guy with the wrong kind of car in
the wrong place," Det. Donna Cheek told a reporter from the Daily
Breeze.</TE>
<TE>   Chavis attracted attention in 1973, shortly after he and four
other African American applicants were admitted to the UC Davis
Medical School under a special minority admissions programs.</TE>
<TE>   The school rejected a white applicant, Allan Bakke, who filed a
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Five years later, ruling in Bakke's suit, the U.S. Supreme Court
struck down the school's affirmative action program. The court said
that, while an applicant's race could be used in determining
admissions, it could not be the only factor in that decision.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from medical school and earning his license to
practice medicine, Chavis returned to the disadvantaged area where he
had been raised, making his home in Compton and practicing as an
obstetrician-gynecologist in Lynwood.</TE>
<TE>   Bakke, who eventually was admitted to and graduated from the
medical school at Davis, became an anesthesiologist in the relatively
upscale town of Rochester, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement to a Senate committee in April 1996, Kennedy said
that beneficiaries of affirmative action "are likely, later in life,
to benefit their professions and the communities in which they live,"
citing Chavis as a perfect example.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the supposedly less qualified African American student who
allegedly displaced Allan Bakke at UC Davis and triggered the
landmark case," Kennedy said. "Today, Dr. Chavis is a successful
ob-gyn in central Los Angeles, making a difference in the lives of
scores of poor families."</TE>
<TE>   Chavis continued to work in the minority community, and most of
his patients continued to be from low-income families. But the
Medical Board of California said that, about the time Kennedy was
delivering his statement, Chavis began spending less time delivering
babies and more time on cosmetic surgery.</TE>
<TE>   After investigating Chavis for more than a year, the board
concluded that his license should be revoked to protect the public.</TE>
<TE>   The board said Chavis had left 43-year-old Tammaria Cotton in his
clinic after surgery, groggy and leaking a red liquid from her
incisions, to check on another liposuction patient who was recovering
in Chavis' home.</TE>
<TE>   When Cotton went into cardiac arrest and stopped breathing, the
nurse at the clinic was unable to revive her.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Chavis' other liposuction patients suffered massive blood
loss and severe infections, the board said.</TE>
<TE>   As the criticism mounted, Chavis insisted that he was the victim
of a racist backlash against outspoken minorities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lynching," he told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   He said he could have lived in Palos Verdes and practiced in an
upscale community, but he chose instead to live and work in the
minority area from which he sprang.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't mean to boast, but I'm somewhat of a hero in the
community," he said.</TE>

<HD>Death Upheld for L.A. Woman</HD>
<DH>Ruling: The nurse arranged roommate's murder. Case is the
first in which state high court weighs a woman's execution since the
death penalty was restored.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A former Los Angeles nurse should be executed for arranging the
murder of her housemate for insurance money, the California Supreme
Court decided Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous decision in the case of Maureen McDermott marked the
first time the state high court has considered a death sentence of a
woman since California reinstated capital punishment in 1978.</LD>
<LD>   McDermott was a 37-year-old nurse at Los Angeles County-USC
Medical Center when she was arrested in the 1985 murder of her
housemate, Stephen Eldridge. She had no previous criminal history.</LD>
<TE>   She challenged her death sentence on a variety of grounds. She
contended that her defense lawyer had been inadequate, that no
evidence existed to link her to the crime other than the hired
killers' testimony, and that the prosecutor committed misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   The court, in an opinion by Justice Joyce L. Kennard, rejected all
McDermott's claims.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said his office was
pleased with the ruling, but a lawyer for McDermott insisted his
client is innocent.</TE>
<TE>   "The California Supreme Court today affirmed the conviction of an
innocent woman who received an unfair trial," said Steffan Imhoff, a
Del Mar lawyer. "The only evidence against her came from the
testimony of a psychotic homicidal maniac with multiple
personalties."</TE>
<TE>   McDermott is one of 13 women and 603 men on California's death
row. No date has been set for her execution, and additional appeals
are pending.</TE>
<TE>   The man she hired to kill Eldridge, Jimmy Luna, a hospital
co-worker, testified against her and pleaded guilty to first-degree
murder. Two brothers that Luna hired to help him in the murder were
granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for their cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   McDermott and Eldridge, a landscaper, owned a house together in
Van Nuys. Each bought a $100,000 life insurance policy naming the
other as beneficiary.</TE>
<TE>   In the months before Eldridge's murder, the relationship between
the roommates deteriorated, the court said in its ruling. Eldridge
complained that McDermott was messy and chided her about her pets.
McDermott was upset about the way Eldridge treated her animals.</TE>
<TE>   In February 1985, McDermott told Luna, a hospital co-worker and
friend, of her plan to kill Eldridge. She offered Luna $50,000--half
of the insurance proceeds--to commit the murder. She said she wanted
the killing to look like a "homosexual murder" because she thought
that the police then would not investigate the gay man's slaying
vigorously.</TE>
<TE>   A first attempt on Eldridge's life in March 1985 failed. Luna and
an accomplice went to the house, and Eldridge opened the door. They
forced their way inside, but Eldridge eventually escaped.</TE>
<TE>   The second attempt succeeded on April 28, 1985. McDermott agreed
to leave a front bedroom window unlocked and told Luna to tie her up
and hit her to make her look like a robbery victim, the court said,
recounting evidence from the trial.</TE>
<TE>   When Luna and his accomplices entered the house at 8:15 p.m.,
Eldridge was not at home. McDermott was alone. She told him to cut
her with a knife to make it appear that Eldridge was killed when he
interrupted a robbery, the court said.</TE>
<TE>   Eldridge came home two hours later, and Luna stabbed him to death.</TE>
<TE>   As they were about to leave the house, McDermott called out to
them "not to forget to cut off Eldridge's penis," the court stated.
"Luna did so."</TE>
<TE>   During the penalty phase of her trial, a physician from USC
testified that McDermott was a compassionate, caring nurse. A deputy
sheriff at the Sybil Brand Institute for Women in Los Angeles
described McDermott as cooperative and sensitive. She said McDermott
had saved another inmate from choking.</TE>
<TE>   But the prosecution said McDermott previously had hired Luna to
beat up someone whose job she wanted.</TE>
<TE>   McDermott said in her appeal that the only evidence linking her to
the crime was uncorroborated testimony. But the state high court said
the prosecution presented evidence of motive--money--and independent
evidence that McDermott was in the house at the time of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "Although Eldridge was stabbed 44 times, defendant received only
superficial wounds, casting doubt on the defense claim that she, like
Eldridge, was a victim of residential robbery," Kennard wrote in
People vs. Maureen McDermott, S016081.</TE>
<TE>   The court also cited as evidence 11 telephone calls between
McDermott and Luna, who is serving a sentence of life in prison, on
the day before and the day of the murder and six calls on the day
after the killing.</TE>
<TE>   California has executed four women, the last in 1962. Since 1992,
the state has put to death 11 men.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Plans to Mark 9/11 Anniversary</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORA ZAMICHOW</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standing in front of a hook-and-ladder fire engine, Mayor James K.
Hahn announced Monday a modest commemoration of the first anniversary
of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The memorial program includes a procession of six emergency
vehicles traveling across the city; the creation of an 8-foot-tall
collage; a noontime moment of silence; and a sunset ceremony at the
Korean Friendship Bell in San Pedro.</LD>
<LD>   Not all the details have been hammered out. Take, for instance,
the procession route. As press secretary Julie Wong put it, "We want
to have as little impact as possible on traffic."</LD>
<TE>   After Los Angeles was belittled for its paltry millennium
festivities, city officials sounded almost defensive in describing
what Hahn called a "modest" tribute in honor of the 2,823 people
killed after hijacked jets crashed into the World Trade Center, the
Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   But across the nation, several cities seemed to be in the midst of
a last-minute scramble to firm up or create plans for the
anniversary. In Boston, where two of the ill-fated airplanes took
off, residents expressed outrage that officials appeared to have no
plans in hand.</TE>
<TE>   "The city wants to recognize the tragic loss we shared on Sept.
11," said Peter Nagle, a spokesman for Mayor Thomas M. Menino. "We're
working towards doing that and want to make sure we get it right."</TE>
<TE>   Nagle said the city hoped to release its plan this week.</TE>
<TE>   New York has numerous events planned, including a procession of
victims' relatives into the lowest level of the Trade Center site.
Activities also are scheduled in other cities including Atlanta,
Chicago, Philadelphia, Miami, Seattle and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, Sept. 11 has been declared Patriot Day by Mayor Dick
Murphy. A public ceremony, followed by a concert, is scheduled at
Balboa Park. San Diegans have been urged to fly flags and turn on
porch lights, and the Navy plans a ceremony on an amphibious assault
ship. In Seattle, city leaders will lead a silent parade to a
downtown park, while Atlantans will stage a candlelight march.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the tribute will begin with bell ringing at
schools, churches and mosques at 5:46 a.m., the local time that the
first plane crashed into the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   At that moment, the six-vehicle procession will begin, starting in
North Hollywood and traveling through Van Nuys, Woodland Hills,
downtown and south Los Angeles. It will end in San Pedro, Wong said.</TE>
<TE>   The procession will be composed of two police cars, two fire
engines, a Red Cross van and a military vehicle. One of the two Fire
Department vehicles will haul what is expected to be a giant collage,
pasted on a wall that could be about 20 feet long.</TE>
<TE>   City officials hope that Angelenos will contribute to the collage
by creating remembrances no larger than 8 1/2-by-11 inches that will
be affixed to a two-sided wall. The remembrances, such as poems,
paintings or photographs, must be dropped off at any fire station or
City Council office before Sept. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said city officials are open to suggestions about where to
permanently house the commemorative wall once the procession is
concluded. At least initially, the wall will be part of an exhibit at
the Firefighters Museum.</TE>
<TE>   One retired firefighter, Brian Prosser, has told Fire Department
officials that he plans to supply a military patch for the collage
that belonged to his son, Staff Sgt. Brian Cody Prosser, who was
killed in "friendly fire" in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the procession and collage, officials said there
will be a ceremony at City Hall that will culminate in a moment of
silence. Following the silence, participants will be invited to the
Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels for an interfaith service.</TE>
<TE>   In the afternoon, the cauldron at the Memorial Coliseum will be
lighted. At sunset, the Lindbergh Beacon atop City Hall will be
illuminated and the lights will sweep the sky until midnight, Wong
said.</TE>
<TE>   Information about additional events will be available on the Web
site www.laremembers.org.</TE>
<TE>   "The tragic events of Sept. 11 left a profound scar on the nation
and Los Angeles," Hahn said. "With three crashed airplanes headed for
Los Angeles, and the men and women from our Fire Department sent to
New York to help in the rescue efforts, the impacts of this day have
great significance for Los Angeles and our residents."</TE>
<TE>   Planning for the program began four weeks ago, Wong said. The
costs, which are not expected to exceed $20,000, will be picked up by
the program sponsor, United Parcel Service, she said.</TE>

<HD>Bill Would Aid Toll Lane Purchase</HD>
<DH>Transportation: In a separate move to ease the crush on the
Riverside Freeway, express bus service will begin on the route in
January.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Anaheim assemblyman announced Monday that he will carry
legislation to help Orange County's transportation agency buy the 91
Express Lanes--a privately owned tollway whose franchise agreement
with the state has blocked major improvements to the congested
Riverside Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the Transportation Authority's board of directors
unanimously approved adding express bus service along the Riverside
Freeway to provide Inland Empire commuters an alternative to their
cars during rush hour. The buses are expected to connect downtown
Riverside and Corona to Costa Mesa and Irvine and serve as many as
325 riders a day to start.</LD>
<LD>   Both the bill and the bus service are part of ongoing efforts by
OCTA and Riverside County transportation officials to relieve
congestion on one of the busiest freeways in Southern California. On
an average workday, motorists make about 250,000 trips on the main
route connecting the Inland Empire with Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   If approved, the bill by Assembly Democrat Lou Correa will grant
OCTA the power to collect tolls after acquiring the Express Lanes--a
critical step for completing purchase of the controversial tollway.</TE>
<TE>   This year, OCTA offered $207.5 million for the lanes, which were
built for about $135 million in the mid-1990s. The tollway, owned by
California Private Transportation Co., runs for 10 miles in the
median of the Riverside Freeway from northern Anaheim to the
Riverside County line.</TE>
<TE>   If the sale goes through, OCTA plans to continue toll operations
until the lanes' construction debt is paid off. Agency officials,
however, want to lift a troublesome non-compete agreement with
Caltrans that has prevented widening the Riverside Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "The bill should preserve the lifeline for the economies of both
Riverside and Orange counties," said Correa, who said he plans to
introduce the bill this week. "Clearly, the 91 experiment has been a
disaster."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to providing toll collection authority, the bill would
create an advisory committee comprising five OCTA board members and
five board members from the Riverside County Transportation
Commission. The panel would include three nonvoting members--a
representative from San Bernardino County and two from Caltrans.</TE>
<TE>   The committee would be responsible for making recommendations to
OCTA about tollway operations and improvements to the Riverside
Freeway in the area served by the 91 Express Lanes.</TE>
<TE>   "The bill is a significant step," said Riverside County Supervisor
Bob Buster, a longtime critic of the tollway. "This really gets us
closer to the end we are seeking."</TE>
<TE>   Although the legislative session ends Aug. 30, elected officials
in Riverside and Orange counties said they are confident the measure
will pass in time to let the deal go through.</TE>
<TE>   Correa is from the majority party in the Legislature, they said,
and significant groundwork already has been done on the bill's
wording to satisfy politicians on the state and local levels.</TE>
<TE>   The measure has been given urgency status, meaning that it must
pass by a two-thirds vote. If approved, it will go into effect
immediately as long as Gov. Gray Davis signs it.</TE>
<TE>   He has 30 days after it leaves the Legislature to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been working for months behind the scenes to deal with a
variety of players that are critical to the bill," said Orange County
Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who chairs the OCTA board. "We have had to
overcome a lot of sentiment against toll roads. We have tried to work
out all the kinks."</TE>
<TE>   The owners of the Express Lanes, Spitzer said, have made it clear
that the deal is not on the table indefinitely, and that the price
could rise if the sale is not closed by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Though optimistic about the bill, Correa said there have been some
questions in the Legislature about how the $207.5 million sales price
was set--$72 million of which will go directly to the Express Lanes
owner as profit.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Garden Grove) said Dunn
continues to have concerns about the accuracy of OCTA's valuation of
the lanes and the financing of the sale. Dunn, he said, hopes to
discuss the issues with OCTA.</TE>
<TE>   Bus service along the troubled route will start in January with 14
buses on two routes. Service will originate at the Galleria at Tyler
in Riverside and the Crossroads Church in Corona. Final destinations
will be 15 stops near South Coast Plaza, the Irvine Business Complex
and UC Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Buses will be available every 20 minutes, and the average run will
last 70 minutes. From 5 a.m. to 8 a.m. the buses will run from
Riverside County to Orange County. The routes will reverse from 3:30
p.m. to 6:30 p.m. The fare is $4 each way, 50 cents cheaper per day
than the Express Lanes.</TE>
<TE>   If the initial service works well, OCTA officials would like to
phase in two more express routes that would go from Riverside County
to Disneyland and business centers in northern Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA estimates that the first two routes will serve about 325
riders a day and roughly 650 commuters if the other routes are added.
Operating all four lines will cost OCTA and the Riverside County
Transportation Commission slightly more than $2 million, with OCTA
assuming 60% of the expense.</TE>

<HD>Photographer Galen Rowell, Wife Killed in Plane Crash</HD>
<DH>Accident: Two others also die. His work was often compared
to that of Ansel Adams.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Renowned wilderness photographer and mountain climber Galen Rowell
and his photographer wife, Barbara, were killed in the crash of a
private airplane early Sunday morning just south of the airport in
Bishop, Calif.</LD>
<LD>   The twin-engine charter aircraft, an Aero Commander 690-B, crashed
about 1:24 a.m. as it made its final approach to the airfield in the
town on the eastern flank of the Sierra, according to the Inyo County
Sheriff's Department. The pilot and all three passengers were killed.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the National Transportation Safety Board, who arrived
at the crash site Monday, are investigating.</LD>
<TE>   The Berkeley-born Rowell, 62, was often compared to Ansel Adams,
with whom he shared a photographic love of Yosemite and the Sierra.
As much an adventurer as a photographer, Rowell was known to become
an active participant in the images he captured, from some of
California's most scenic heights to the mountains of Nepal.</TE>
<TE>   "Rowell photographed the mountains of the Sierra as a challenge,"
said Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club. "There was a
lot more distance in what Ansel did. Galen was a climber and
photographed things like a climber. When I saw his photographs I
always wondered, where ... did he find them?</TE>
<TE>   "He inspired people to get out and engage and explore those
places. He was Ansel's successor, but was much more diverse."</TE>
<TE>   What dazzled many of Rowell's fans was that he went to
extraordinary lengths to take pictures of familiar landmarks such as
Mt. Whitney and turn them into art.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference between Galen and most amateur photographers is
that he would be out in the Sierra for 12 straight days and be there
twice a day for the twilight hours," said George Olson, director of
photography for Sunset magazine, which frequently taps Rowell's vast
number of stock images. "Galen lived his life to get those
photographs, no matter what time of day. The view of those places is
the same to all of us, but the picture will never be the same as the
ones he took."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Aircraft in Trouble</TE>
<TE>   The couple were returning to Bishop after making a trip to the
Bering Sea, where Rowell taught a photo workshop.</TE>
<TE>   A caller to the Sheriff's Department early Sunday morning reported
observing an aircraft that appeared to be in trouble and then hearing
a crash. An initial examination of the crash site indicated that
there had been no fire, according to the Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Inyo County coroner's office said Monday that
all of the victims have been tentatively identified. The other two
were Tom Reid, 46, and Carol McAfee, both of Bishop.</TE>
<TE>   The charter flight originated in Oakland, with a flight plan
filled out directly to Bishop, where the Rowells lived and operated
Mountain Light Gallery.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Calder, operations manager for the gallery, said the couple
had been expected there Sunday morning; the gallery had arranged for
Reid, the pilot, to fly to pick them up. The gallery's Web site
(www.mountainlight.com) said plans for services will be posted when
they are finalized.</TE>
<TE>   Rowell, whose work has appeared in National Geographic, Life,
Outdoor Photographer, Outside and other national magazines, returned
in mid-July from a seven-week trek through Tibet with three friends
while on assignment for National Geographic.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mountain Climber</TE>
<TE>   The photographer led an adventurous life.</TE>
<TE>   Once called "a cross between Sir Edmund Hilary and Ansel Adams" by
People magazine, he made first ascents of more than 100 routes in
Yosemite and the High Sierra range. He also made more than 35 trips
to the mountains of Nepal, India, Pakistan, China, Tibet, Africa,
Alaska, Canada, Siberia, New Zealand, Norway and Patagonia.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to major expeditions to Mt. Everest, K2 and Pakistan's
Gasherbrum II, he made the first one-day ascents of Mt. McKinley in
Alaska and Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa, as well as first ascents of
several Himalayan peaks.</TE>
<TE>   Rowell's wife, Barbara, 54, whom he married in 1981, was a
well-known photographer, whose work appeared in National Geographic
and on book and magazine covers.</TE>
<TE>   The couple moved to Bishop from the Bay Area early last year and
bought an old bank building in the center of town, which they turned
into a gallery.</TE>
<TE>   She accompanied her husband on most of his travels to exotic
locations, including a monthlong trek in Nepal with actor-director
Robert Redford in 1982, and a National Geographic assignment in
Pakistan, where they were flown throughout the Himalayas as guests of
the nation's president.</TE>
<TE>   She also was a pilot who flew her Cessna 206 for most of her
husband's aerial photographs.</TE>
<TE>   Known for his photographic celebrations of the natural world and
its beauty, Rowell's best-selling image is that of a rainbow he shot
in 1981 at the end of a monthlong trek through Tibet.</TE>
<TE>   To get the picture he wanted, he literally chased the rainbow
until it appeared to end on the roof of the Potala Palace, the former
residence of the Dalai Lama. The picture has appeared on book covers,
national magazines and posters.</TE>
<TE>   "You work with the elements and you put them where you want them,"
he told People magazine in 1986. "In a way I'm part of the picture,
not just someone standing there clicking the shutter."</TE>
<TE>   Rowell was introduced to the wilderness at an early age by his
speech professor father and concert cellist mother, who took him
camping in the Sierras. By age 10, he was climbing mountains on
Sierra Club outings, and at 16, he made his first roped climbs in
Yosemite Valley.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he was 30, he had logged more than 100 first ascents
of new routes in the Yosemite Valley and in the High Sierra back
country.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yosemite Assignment</TE>
<TE>   Rowell dropped out of UC Berkeley and opened a car repair shop to
support himself while he continued to climb on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   "I started taking photographs just to show friends and family what
I was doing, then I got curious about the photographic process," he
told The Times in 1987. "Making good photos became an end in itself."</TE>
<TE>   He sold his auto repair business and became a full-time
photographer in 1972. A year later, he was assigned to do a cover
story on Yosemite National Park for National Geographic.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, he received the Ansel Adams Award for his contributions
to the art of wilderness photography.</TE>
<TE>   Rowell wrote, co-wrote or supplied the photographs for nearly 20
books, including "Mountain Light," "My Tibet" and "North America the
Beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Climbing continued to inspire Rowell.</TE>
<TE>   "You can go back in the American Alpine Journal and he's had
climbs in recent years and virtually every year going back to the
'60s," said Lloyd Athearn, deputy director of the Alpine Club, based
in Golden, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   "For several decades, he's been a leading American climber. In his
60s, he was still climbing at a very high standard that many climbers
younger than him would be happy to do."</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very important figure in American mountaineering," said
Steve Roper, an Oakland-based outdoors writer and former Rowell
climbing partner. "I think every mountain outdoors type in America
knows his name.</TE>
<TE>   "He brought the mountains to many, many households."</TE>

<HD>Tentative Deal Reached in Inmates' Suit</HD>
<DH>Courts: Ventura County would pay 80 plaintiffs held in jail
too long without being charged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ventura County Sheriff's Department has reached a tentative
settlement in a federal class-action lawsuit that contends deputies
and local police violated the legal rights of dozens of inmates by
keeping them in jail too long without filing criminal charges.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for the Sheriff's Department declined to say how much
money 80 former inmates will receive in the settlement, which was
reached last week and is expected to be presented to the Board of
Supervisors on Sept. 10.</LD>
<LD>   But the plaintiffs' lawyer, John Burton of Pasadena, said the
value of the settlement is about $250,000, including $52,500 in legal
fees. The amount per inmate ranges from about $100 to $5,000, with
the inmates who were not convicted of a crime collecting the bulk of
the money.</LD>
<TE>   "The problem was, [authorities] were doing an end-run around the
law that says we have a right to get in front of a judge in a certain
length of time," Burton said. "And that's a very important right."</TE>
<TE>   State law requires that suspects be arraigned on criminal charges
or released within 48 hours of arrest.</TE>
<TE>   But for years, officers in Ventura County routinely rearrested
suspects as they were technically released, but still in custody.
That gave prosecutors more time to gather evidence to support
charges.</TE>
<TE>   It also placed many suspects who were never convicted of the
crimes for which they were arrested behind bars for extra days.</TE>
<TE>   "Thirty people who would otherwise have been free spent 110 days
behind bars because of this policy," Burton said. They will receive
$1,250 for each extra day. "For another group, it was much more of a
technical violation, because they were ultimately sentenced on their
crimes and received credit for time served." Most of those will
receive $100 for each extra day.</TE>
<TE>   In-custody arrests affected far more inmates than the 80 involved
in the federal lawsuit, because the sheriff's top jailer said the
practice went on for at least three decades. The plaintiffs were
those affected in the year before Burton filed a legal claim in
February 2001. The others were excluded by a statute of limitations.</TE>
<TE>   Burton said he knows of no other California county that has used
in-custody arrests to exceed the two-day custody limit, because the
practice violates suspects' constitutional rights against
unreasonable seizures and denies them liberty without due process of
law. County officials had maintained that other counties did the same
thing, but county lawyer Philip Erickson said he was unable to
confirm that.</TE>
<TE>   "The real ironic thing about it," Erickson said, "is that all of
the various local agencies were aware of the practice, including the
court system, the public defender and the district attorney's
office."</TE>
<TE>   The tentative settlement marks the second time that Ventura County
has resolved a lawsuit involving improper in-custody arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the Sheriff's Department paid $125,000 to
Westlake Village businessman Lee R. Mannheimer, who was jailed for
several days on suspicion of attempting to kill his ex-wife in
1999--but never charged with the crime.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County Jail, which is run by the Sheriff's Department,
stopped allowing the rearrest of uncharged inmates in December 2000,
several months after Mannheimer sued, and following a legal challenge
by Public Defender Kenneth Clayman, who declared at the time: "We
can't hold people in custody for undue lengths of time like they do
in South Africa."</TE>
<TE>   By early 2001, Sheriff Bob Brooks said he was convinced the
practice was wrong and that he had banned it.</TE>
<TE>   Both the class-action lawsuit and the public defender's petition
were filed on behalf of Jorge Robert Juarez, who was arrested on
suspicion of burglary and rearrested 47 hours later. Juarez spent 105
hours in jail without ever going before a judge. He eventually was
convicted of burglary. He will split $10,000 from the settlement with
the other named plaintiff in the suit, Felipe Dominguez.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez was arrested on suspicion of threatening public
employees, but prosecutors filed no charges when he was taken to
court. He was then rearrested for a probation violation and
convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Although county prosectors worried that the change in policy might
free criminals who would then flee prosecution, Chief Deputy Dist.
Atty. Patricia Murphy said she knows of no case in which that has
happened.</TE>

<LD>A Corporate Carol ... a fable of August 14, the deadline day for CEOs
to swear that every figure in the quarterly and annual reports they
sign is accurate--or risk 20 years in prison and a $5-million fine.</LD>
<LD>   Marley was dead, and good riddance, as far as Screw was concerned.</LD>
<LD>   E. Benezer Screw had not founded the company. That was old man
Marley's work. Screw had merely swooped in to do that leverage-buyout
voodoo that he could do so well, and Marley became just a name on the
letterhead, and over time, Screw's solidly Swiss account balance had
three commas in it.</LD>
<TE>   Now Marley had been put under the sod today, and that night,
Screw's brow was unfurrowed.</TE>
<TE>   So what was Marley doing there in Screw's bedroom, his old face on
the big plasma-screen TV that was bigger even than the one Screw had
installed in his bathroom, which he could watch through the $6,000
optically corrected glass shower door and see every putt at St.
Andrews, as he cleansed his expensively toned self?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe this," said Screw to the screen. "You may be an
indigested drop of 25-year-old single malt, a fragment of underdone
fugu fish." Marley, who was getting more TV face-time dead than he
ever had alive, repeated sepulchrally, "The reckoning is coming.
Beware the ides of August minus one."</TE>
<TE>   Screw knew his tyrants: ides minus one--August 14. Tomorrow. Like
he'd believe Marley. If Marley had known anything about business as
the big boys play it, he and not Screw would be the one with the
three-comma Swiss bank account.</TE>
<TE>   Screw dozed off until he heard his clock, the one that had once
ticked away the hours of the last Empress of France, chime midnight,
and another face flickered on-screen.</TE>
<TE>   It was Screw's ex-girlfriend. God, she looked awful. No wonder
he'd dumped her. He was surprised it had taken him as long as it did.
She'd actually cried when he offered to give her plastic surgery for
Christmas. Women.</TE>
<TE>   "I am the Ghost of Vulgar Excess past," she said. "Look upon this,
you rat."</TE>
<TE>   And up on the screen came his unbelievable 40th birthday party,
right after he'd bought the studio. He'd flown everyone to Cannes,
then to Greece, all on the company tab. He didn't know anyone had
taped all that!</TE>
<TE>   Then--look, there was that hilarious Halloween party where
everyone dressed poor and did a parody of the annual meeting, playing
those 10-share stockholders who show up whining and begging Screw not
to clear-cut some forest in someplace Screw couldn't pronounce, or
knock down an old library where some geezer had written some novel or
another. Fabulous stuff!</TE>
<TE>   He was still smiling when his ex-girlfriend came back on screen.
"Adios, creep," she said. "Next, the Ghost of Vulgar Excess present."</TE>
<TE>   The clock struck one. The screen flickered. It was his assistant,
Deb. Good ol' Deb. He hadn't given her a raise in seven years, or
maybe it was eight, but her common-stock options--better than cash,
someday. That's what he'd told her.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, the stock had dropped, all right, nose-dived, but that's the
market. No guts, no glory, no gold, he told her. "No gold," Deb
echoed now.</TE>
<TE>   Behind her was a news montage. Other CEOs, men he knew, being
perp-walked down Wall Street. Footage of old men, stockholders,
pushing brooms at McDonald's, after their nest eggs went rotten. Old
ladies, stockholders, outside Ken Lay's mansion, pounding spoons on
empty tins of cat food, all they could afford to eat.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't go away--there's still the Ghost of Vulgar Excess future,"
Deb was saying. "I gotta go look through the neighbors' trash for
recyclables."</TE>
<TE>   Screw must have dozed again, for when he awoke, it was 2 a.m., and
a new figure filled the screen, terrifying and spectral: cheap suit,
bad haircut, raucous gift tie--a federal prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   Screw watched as the figure floated down long gray corridors, and
stopped in front of a gray door with a small barred window. The
figure's forefinger, ragged with hangnails, beckoned the camera
closer, then pointed slowly to a sign: "Federal prisoner No. 0115389,
Screw, E.B. Parole date: 2022."</TE>
<TE>   Screw fell sobbing to his knees. Not him! Not the highest-flying
CEO in the flock! He looked down, fully expecting to see prison
stripes, but there were his $300 Egyptian-cotton jammies. He was
still home! Safe! It was only a dream! "The shadows of things that
would be, may be dispelled!" he wept. "They will be! I know they
will!"</TE>
<TE>   And so Screw promised to honor truth and to seek it out, to give
Deb a raise, to stay up late and drink coffee and sweat over the
figures with his calculator before he signed his reports, to stop
pocketing 300 times a salesclerk's salary plus options and expenses,
and to sell the smaller yacht and the second beach house--in short,
to keep August 14 in his heart, always.</TE>
<TE>   We'd like to say that Mr. Screw was as good as his word, and also
endowed a children's hospital and an animal sanctuary, but it's
August, not December, and even the tooth fairy is on vacation.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An American soldier has died of wounds received two weeks ago while
hunting for Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan, the
Pentagon said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Sgt. 1st Class Christopher James Speer, 28, of Albuquerque, N.M.,
was among five U.S. soldiers injured in an ambush July 27 in eastern
Afghanistan. He died Wednesday, a Department of Defense statement
said. Speer was assigned to Headquarters U.S. Army Special Operations
Command at Ft. Bragg, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   About 50 U.S. soldiers and allied Afghan militiamen were trying to
confirm intelligence about an enemy operative in the area when they
came under small-arms fire, commanders said at the time. Special
Forces and conventional troops were flown to the fight after the
ambush, putting a total of about 100 troops on the ground.</LD>
<TE>   Two allied Afghan militiamen were killed in the 4 1/2-hour gun
battle.</TE>
<TE>   Speer had been evacuated to Germany for medical care.</TE>
<TE>   At least three of those who opened fire on the U.S. and Afghan
troops from a mud-brick compound also were killed, officials said.</TE>

<LD>Azerbaijan's Armenian-populated rebel region of Nagorno-Karabakh has
reelected an independence hard-liner as its leader.</LD>
<LD>   Electoral officials said preliminary figures showed Arkady
Gukasyan had won a five-year term as "president" of the mountainous
territory that broke away from then-Soviet Azerbaijan in 1988.
Gukasyan took 89% of the vote, held in defiance of Azerbaijan and the
world community, which does not recognize Karabakh's independence.</LD>

<HD>Government's Plan to Help Germany's Jobless Draws Fire</HD>
<DH>Europe: Foes call the proposals ordered by Schroeder sops
ahead of elections in September.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>The details haven't been officially released yet, but a sweeping plan
to reform the labor market ordered by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
drew sharp criticism Monday from political opponents, who called it
too little to rescue Germany's 4 million unemployed--or to help the
embattled incumbent win reelection.</LD>
<LD>   A long-awaited report by a 15-member commission was to have
launched a nonpartisan effort to halve Germany's 10% unemployment
rate--the most pressing issue in the campaign for elections next
month--within three years.</LD>
<LD>   But Lothar Spaeth, the economic point man on Schroeder challenger
Edmund Stoiber's campaign team, denounced the commission's five
months of work as little more than an election tactic. Others in the
opposition Christian Democratic Union and their pro-business allies,
the Free Democrats, put the government on notice that they will not
be around for Friday's ceremonial presentation of the report.</LD>
<TE>   Spaeth's success over the last decade in turning around the
mammoth Zeiss optical factory in eastern Germany has made him the
opposition's darling. He had originally praised efforts by
Schroeder's government to loosen strictures on employers to encourage
the creation of new jobs.</TE>
<TE>   But as the campaign for the Sept. 22 elections heats up, Spaeth
and his political allies are lambasting the report's conclusions,
which have been widely circulated by politicians and journalists, as
a watered-down minimum to which all 15 commission members could
agree.</TE>
<TE>   "Unanimity turned out to be their primary objective," Spaeth told
reporters. "For that reason, one can no longer find any substantial
positions."</TE>
<TE>   Stoiber rejected the commission's conclusions as "twaddle."</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the recommendations are proposals for a temporary
employment agency for young job seekers, massive investment to
encourage private business in the depressed eastern states and modest
reductions in benefits for long-term unemployed--more than 50% of
Germany's jobless--who refuse to move for a job or take lower-paying
positions.</TE>
<TE>   Consideration is also being given to a limited tax amnesty for
Germans who have stashed income abroad, in hopes of encouraging them
to invest it at home.</TE>
<TE>   "It's better to have people working in Leipzig than money sitting
in Liechtenstein. That's the principle," Schroeder told journalists,
adding that the commission was still looking for a formula that would
not, by rewarding tax cheats, anger those who have followed the
rules.</TE>
<TE>   The commission drew together representatives of trade unions and
employee associations as well as employers, economists and government
officials. Schroeder this year appointed Volkswagen personnel chief
Peter Hartz to direct the effort, apparently impressed with the
employment record of Europe's biggest automaker. Schroeder served on
the board of directors at VW during his years as governor of Lower
Saxony, home to the massive car works in Wolfsburg.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder's economic advisors have been less than enthusiastic
about the commission's work. Finance Minister Hans Eichel has openly
disparaged its call for the investment of as much as $150 billion in
job creation in the five eastern states, where unemployment averages
18%, as a burden on the already deficit-ridden federal budget. Even
the Party of Democratic Socialism, the former East German
Communists--with whom the Social Democrats share power in two eastern
states--has said the proposals are unlikely to improve the plight of
jobless easterners.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts blame Germany's rigid labor market for the
disappointing growth rate in the last two years of an economy that is
Europe's biggest and No. 3 in the world. The commission had been
expected to challenge unions' power to force wage increases and
ensure generous benefits and job security.</TE>
<TE>   The conservative newspaper Die Welt quoted economists as saying
that the commission goal of cutting unemployment by half is
"illusory." The more supportive Sueddeutsche Zeitung put the onus on
Schroeder to confront the unions that have been his traditional
support base, or risk losing the election.</TE>
<TE>   "The Social Democrats and Greens must clearly say before Sept. 22
what they plan to implement," the Munich-based daily said. "The
chancellor has the opportunity to show whether he has the strength to
tackle the unions."</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder's Social Democrats and their allies, the Greens,
collectively trail the Christian Democrat-Free Democrat team by 10
percentage points, an Emnid poll for independent N-TV showed Monday.
But the same survey indicated that Schroeder remains more popular
than Stoiber.</TE>

<HD>Kabul Schools Run Out of Room</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Returning refugees have swelled the ranks of
street children--and the class rosters. But aid for education is
limited.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Eight-year-old Abdullah waves a can of burning incense at passersby,
begging for tips. Najila, 10, scavenges in the streets for twigs and
scraps of paper to sell as heating fuel. Nearby, Gulnoor, 7, buffs
fenders he can barely reach before imploring motorists for coins.</LD>
<LD>   It's another day on the job for three of Kabul's hustling street
children, all thrust there by poverty and the mass repatriation of
refugee families that is overwhelming the country's fragile social
structure, especially schools.</LD>
<LD>   Street children have been a chronic problem in Kabul, the Afghan
capital, since war broke out in 1979. But their ranks have swollen to
an estimated 38,000 by the mass return of refugees who spent years,
or even decades, in exile in Pakistan, Iran and other countries.</LD>
<TE>   The U.N. refugee agency expects the number of Afghans who have
returned home since the Taliban regime was ousted late last year to
surpass 1.5 million today--60% more than anticipated. And the number
could reach 2 million this year.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of refugees, about 1.4 million so far this year,
have returned from Pakistan. The story of Mantaz, a 14-year-old girl
who sells water, does light manual labor and serves as a messenger in
Kabul, is typical. Her family comes from the Panjshir Valley north of
Kabul, but it can't return to its farm land there because of drought
and because the Taliban destroyed the irrigation system and orchards
to eliminate cover for its enemies. The family members sought safety
in numbers in Kabul, where they struggle with overcrowding, high
costs and scarcities.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan faces myriad health, food and shelter problems as it
struggles to recover from a generation of mayhem and dislocation.</TE>
<TE>   But the plight of children is causing special concern. Their loss
of childhood and education will make it harder for Afghanistan to
break its vicious cycle of violence and hatred. Elke Wisch, UNICEF's
chief of child protection services in Afghanistan, calls it "the
culture of the gun."</TE>
<TE>   "Unless it changes, the same fate will await them as their parents
and grandparents," Wisch said. "Everything will continue as it has."</TE>
<TE>   Preliminary results of a government study show 2.6 million
children enrolled in grades one through six last March, a sharp rise
from the 1.1 million pupils who registered the previous year and far
above the 1.8 million that UNICEF had projected.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the increase comes from the reregistration of girls, who
had been forbidden by the Taliban to attend school. Now, girls
account for nearly half of Kabul's elementary school enrollment. But
a bigger boost has come from returnees, who are arriving at the
schools in such high numbers that some are being turned away.</TE>
<TE>   That is what happened to Nashad, 11, a shoeshine boy whose family
comes from another devastated farming area in Afghanistan, the
Shomali plain, which was on the front line between Taliban and
opposition Northern Alliance fighters. The plain is strewn with so
many land mines, burned-out mud brick houses and the wreckage of
tanks and other vehicles that his family prefers to stay in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   After Nashad was turned away by public schools, a private school
found a place for him.</TE>
<TE>   Just as the situation becomes more acute for children, the United
Nations has had to cut back on aid to education here because the tide
of refugees has made relief aid--food and health assistance--a high
priority, said Maki Shinohara, spokeswoman here for the Office of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the countries that promised millions of dollars in
humanitarian aid at an international conference in Tokyo in January
have failed to deliver so far, she said, forcing budget cutbacks.
One-third of emergency food aid, or $90 million, has failed to
materialize, and aid officials here bitterly criticize the European
Union and Japan for falling behind on their pledges. U.N. housing
assistance also has been cut.</TE>
<TE>   "We're simply running out, which is not a good thing before
winter," Shinohara said.</TE>
<TE>   More aid could help finance schools such as the Swiss-run
Aschiana. The school has temporarily taken about 2,000 children,
including Nashad, off the streets to teach them reading and writing
skills, plus vocations such as appliance repair and crafts.</TE>
<TE>   "Without education, the only future these children have is as
better thieves," said Aschiana school administrator Sadat, who, like
many Afghans, goes by only one name.</TE>
<TE>   Najila spends her mornings learning to make paper flowers in
school before hitting the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah, his skin already parched and stained by sun and
pollution, isn't as lucky. He spends all day outside with his incense
burner, which is supposed to bestow good luck on those who cross its
path. He says he needs to work to help his widowed father, a cobbler
who makes about $1.40 a day. Still, Abdullah's intelligent face
darkens when he is asked if he'd rather be in class.</TE>
<TE>   "I registered for school," he said. "They said they would answer
when they could take me, but they never did. There is no room."</TE>

<HD>Israeli Court OKs Expulsion Plans</HD>
<DH>Mideast: A trio of Palestinians to be moved from the West
Bank to the Gaza Strip are relatives of terrorism suspects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A military court Monday approved the expulsion of three Palestinian
relatives of suspected terrorists from the West Bank to the Gaza
Strip, in a new Israeli tactic aimed at discouraging Palestinians
from carrying out attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Human rights activists said the decision would be appealed to
Israeli civilian courts.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinian political factions, meanwhile, gave in to militant
groups and scrapped a call for an end to attacks on Israeli
civilians. Meeting in Gaza City to try to create a "national unity
leadership," they endorsed the Palestinians' nearly 2-year-old
uprising against Israel.</LD>
<TE>   The three Palestinians facing expulsion are Intisar and Kifah
Ajouri, the sister and brother of Ali Ajouri, who is accused of
giving explosives belts to suicide bombers, and Abdel Nasser Assida,
brother of a Hamas activist who is suspected of killing several
Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   The expulsions would be the first of their kind.</TE>
<TE>   Nabil abu Rudaineh, an aide to Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat, called for international intervention to stop the
expulsions. "This will not help calm the situation," Rudaineh said.</TE>
<TE>   In Gaza City, the unity meeting came after pressure on the
Palestinian leadership to make sweeping reforms. The political
factions met to establish unified positions in preparation for
elections in January and other planned changes.</TE>
<TE>   The factions say they want the leadership to involve all major
groups--including the militant Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which have
carried out many of the suicide bombings against Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian leadership has called for a halt to attacks on
civilians, but the militant groups have persisted with daily
shootings and frequent bombings. Even the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a
group linked to Arafat's Fatah movement, has kept up its campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed call for ending attacks on civilians was dropped
because the more militant groups opposed it.</TE>
<TE>   However, even if the proposal were adopted, the current
Palestinian leadership would remain in place, and the powers of the
new body would appear to be limited.</TE>

<HD>Iraqi Official Rejects Return of Inspectors</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Information minister contradicts Hussein on
compliance and denies existence of weapons. Some see the mixed
messages as a ploy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An Iraqi Cabinet minister said Monday that Baghdad will not allow the
return of U.N. weapons inspectors, a move that could sabotage efforts
by the international community to peacefully disarm the regime of
President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   If the statement reflects Iraq's position, it could also provide
the Bush administration with the leverage it needs to convince
reluctant European allies and key Arab regimes that there is no
diplomatic alternative to a military confrontation.</LD>
<LD>   Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed Said Sahaf said the United
Nations had finished its mission in his country. "The work of
inspection teams in Iraq has finished," he said in an interview with
the Qatar-based Al Jazeera satellite television network, a leading
Arabic-language media outlet.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. claims that Iraq still has weapons of mass destruction are "a
lie," Sahaf added in the interview, which was conducted in Baghdad.
President Bush "knows that he is standing in quicksand when it comes
to his baseless talk on Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   The intent and the veracity of Sahaf's statement remained unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Just a day earlier, Hussein told a visiting British politician
that he had "accepted and would implement" all U.N. resolutions,
including "unfettered access" to all sites denied in earlier
inspections. The Iraqi leader made the comments during a 95-minute
interview in his bunker with George Galloway, a Labor Party member of
Parliament who strongly opposes a military campaign against Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Galloway described the bunker as so deep that it took 20 seconds
to descend to it, according to Britain's Mail on Sunday newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Late Monday, Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri announced that
Baghdad was preparing a formal reply to a letter from U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan about the status of the weapons
inspections.</TE>
<TE>   The White House response to Iraq's mixed messages was muted, and
the United Nations said it would not react until it received formal
notification. The information minister's remarks appeared to take
both by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "You take these things with a grain of salt," said a Bush
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "This is
the information minister. Then the foreign minister says something
else. We'll take all of this in and see where we are. But the bottom
line is that the inspections are a means to an end, and disarmament
is the goal--and disarmament hasn't been achieved."</TE>
<TE>   But some American analysts claimed that Sahaf would not take such
a tough position unless it reflected Baghdad's posture.</TE>
<TE>   "He would only reflect a decision. He doesn't speak on his own; no
one in Baghdad does," said Judith Yaphe, a former intelligence
analyst who is now a senior fellow at the National Defense University
in Washington. "It's official Iraq policy or he wouldn't say it. No
government minister speaks out of line."</TE>
<TE>   Both U.S. officials and Iraq experts outside the government said
Iraq may be engaged in a ploy. Baghdad has sent mixed messages about
inspections for years, according to Charles Duelfer, who was the top
U.S. weapons inspector in Iraq and is now a senior fellow at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "The Iraqis have been very concerned, trying to figure out the
messages from Washington. From their perspective, they have a huge
problem: Is Washington serious? Does it want the inspectors back or
not? Will Iraq be invaded anyway? It doesn't surprise me at all that
they have a range of positions to throw out there," Duelfer said.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department charged Monday that the Iraqis were merely
trying to divert attention.</TE>
<TE>   "They refuse to face up to their obligations, and obfuscate and
look for ways to move the goalposts when it's a simple situation,"
department spokesman Philip T. Reeker said. "Iraq needs to disarm."</TE>
<TE>   Duelfer and others predicted that Sahaf's statement and even the
impending formal response to the United Nations will not be the final
word.</TE>
<TE>   "They will try to reengage the U.N. when it's more evident that
the U.S. is starting to build up its forces. They'll be looking for
another way out," Duelfer said. "That's a card Saddam will play at
some point down the road," as he did before the 1991 Persian Gulf
War.</TE>
<TE>   Sahaf's statement came as six Iraqi opposition groups continued
talks Monday with Bush administration officials in Washington. The
groups, based in Britain, Iran and the Kurdistan area of northern
Iraq, met with National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice and the
State Department's Iraq experts.</TE>

<HD>Farmers' Fate Still Unclear</HD>
<DH>Africa: Zimbabwean leader says 'loyal' whites can still
work land after redistribution to blacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe</DL>
<LD>President Robert Mugabe told the nation Monday that the days of
whites owning large farms in Zimbabwe are over but that "loyal"
whites who cooperate with his government will not be left completely
landless.</LD>
<LD>   The fate of hundreds of white farmers defying government orders to
give up their land remained unclear.</LD>
<LD>   Mugabe said he would not tolerate opposition to his plans to
redistribute white-owned farms to blacks. He said black commercial
farmers are expected to take over allocated land by the end of this
month.</LD>
<TE>   "That deadline stands," Mugabe said in a televised address. But,
he said, he would still be willing to do business with white farmers
who cooperate with his government.</TE>
<TE>   "All genuine and well-meaning white farmers who wish to pursue a
farming career as loyal citizens of this country will have land to do
so," Mugabe said.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers prevented from working their fields during land seizures
over the last two years were puzzled by Mugabe's remarks, said David
Hasluck, director of the Commercial Farmers' Union, representing
4,000 white farmers.</TE>
<TE>   "That loyal Zimbabweans can farm is entirely new to us. The
majority of my members have been trying to farm as loyal Zimbabweans,
but they have been stopped from doing so," Hasluck said.</TE>
<TE>   Mugabe also said whites will not be allowed to stay on large
properties, own more than one farm or cling to ties with Britain, the
former colonial power.</TE>

<HD>Lawsuit Over Gay Inmate's Visit Rights Is Reinstated</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court reinstated a lawsuit brought by a gay
inmate's domestic partner who contended the couple were wrongly
prohibited from embracing and kissing in a prison visiting area.</LD>
<LD>   The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision centered on an Arizona
Department of Corrections regulation banning prisoners from hugging
and kissing unrelated visitors of the same sex.</LD>
<LD>   Karl Whitmire, whose partner is in an Arizona prison, sued the
department after prison staff told the couple they were not allowed
to hug during visits. According to the court opinion, Whitmire's
partner was told if they hugged again "it would be a long time before
you see him again."</LD>
<TE>   The appellate court decision said the District Court was wrong in
dismissing Whitmire's claim. The department maintained its rule was
to ensure homosexual inmates would not be marked as gay by the prison
community, and was a safety precaution.</TE>
<TE>   But the opinion said that because the couple are openly gay, the
rule has no relevance.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Matthews, an ACLU staff attorney who represented Whitmire,
called the ruling "encouraging because prisons tend to be given a
huge amount of discretion by the courts."</TE>
<TE>   "It sends a message that you can't arbitrarily treat people
differently because of their sexual orientation," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Stewart, director of the Arizona Department of Corrections,
refused to comment on the ruling. The opinion was written by Judge A.
Wallace Tashima.</TE>

<HD>Positive Anthrax Test on Mailbox</HD>
<DH>Crime: The box is found in New Jersey near site where
tainted letters were postmarked.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. postal inspectors investigating anthrax mailings linked to five
deaths have discovered a mailbox that tested positive for traces of
the bacteria, a postal spokesman said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The mailbox was found last week in Princeton, N.J., and has been
sent to an Army facility in Aberdeen, Md., for forensic analysis,
said Dan Mihalko a spokesman for the U.S. Postal Service.</LD>
<LD>   He said the mailbox was discovered as investigators checked
hundreds of boxes from which mail is funneled to a postal sorting
center in Trenton, N.J., where four anthrax-laced letters were
postmarked last year.</LD>
<TE>   "We've been looking at all the mailboxes that feed into the
Trenton facility," Mihalko said. "One of them did test positive."</TE>
<TE>   The mailbox was sent to the Army laboratory for more conclusive
tests, he said, adding, "We've seen in the past field tests that turn
up false positives."</TE>
<TE>   Five people died and 13 were sickened last year as anthrax-tainted
letters were sent to government officials and media outlets in
Washington, Florida and New York. The letters were mailed in the
weeks after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The FBI launched an
investigation in October to find out who was responsible for the
anthrax attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are offering a $2.5-million reward for information
leading to an arrest and conviction in the case.</TE>

<HD>Corporate Lawyers Serve the Investors, SEC Chief Insists</HD>
<DH>Reform: Speaking to Bar association, Pitt says attorneys
are forgetting who 'ultimate client' is.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The head of the Securities and Exchange Commission warned corporate
lawyers Monday that they will face growing federal regulation unless
they fight fraud from within their companies.</LD>
<LD>   Corporate lawyers, like auditors, have sometimes forgotten that
their "ultimate client" is the investing public, Harvey L. Pitt, the
beleaguered SEC chief, told business lawyers at the annual meeting of
the American Bar Assn.</LD>
<LD>   "Lawyers for public companies represent the company as a whole and
its shareholder owners, not the managers who hire and fire them," he
said. "This should be self-evident, but recent events indicate some
corporate lawyers have lost sight of this axiom."</LD>
<TE>   The public's anger over the wave of corporate scandals has focused
mostly on chief executives who got rich while hiding the trouble
facing their companies, and secondarily on the accountants who failed
to reveal the facts about these schemes.</TE>
<TE>   But corporate lawyers also share some of the blame, Pitt said. In
some instances, they played a key role in structuring schemes that
deceived investors, while others helped to cover up the frauds.</TE>
<TE>   In the recently enacted corporate reform law, Congress required
the creation of an oversight board to set rules for the accounting
profession.</TE>
<TE>   In a little-noticed provision, the law also requires the SEC,
within six months, to set "minimum standards for professional conduct
for attorneys." Lawmakers said lawyers have a duty to reveal evidence
of potential illegal conduct to the company's directors.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt said this provision reflects a growing skepticism in Congress
over whether the "legal profession can police itself."</TE>
<TE>   Pitt himself has become a divisive figure because of his past
close ties with the accounting industry. Several top lawmakers,
including Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and Sen. John
McCain (R-Ariz.), have called for Pitt's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, lawyers, like accountants, have been regulated by
their peers. State bar associations hear complaints about lawyers and
can discipline those who violate ethics rules.</TE>
<TE>   "But I have to say I'm not impressed, or pleased" by the response
of the state bars when informed by the SEC of complaints about
lawyers, Pitt said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, before the collapse of Enron Corp., the ABA was
debating whether to change the ethics rules to require in some cases
that lawyers reveal their clients' misdeeds.</TE>
<TE>   That idea clashed with a basic rule governing how lawyers operate.
The standard rule of attorney-client privilege assumes the lawyer
will keep secret what he or she learns from a client.</TE>
<TE>   Reformers argued that the ethics rules should be changed to put
the public's interest first, even if it means betraying a client's
confidence.</TE>
<TE>   ABA members were divided and failed to agree on a change in the
rules. However, the new corporate reform act took the issue out of
the ABA's hands, at least for company lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, when Congress was debating the corporate reform law,
the ABA's leaders strongly opposed the rules for lawyers. But after
Pitt's speech Monday, the group's incoming president had a muted
reaction.</TE>
<TE>   "We all agree that after Enron, we are operating in a new
environment," said ABA President-elect Alfred P. Carlton, a business
lawyer from Raleigh, N.C. "He was reminding us that we have public
responsibilities as lawyers, and I agree with him on that. My duty is
to the corporate entity, not necessarily to the management that hires
me."</TE>
<TE>   For Pitt and the SEC, the week ahead will likely be a busy one.
Wednesday is the deadline for the chief executives of more than 900
companies to certify in writing the accuracy of their financial
reports.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt said the agency expects to file a record number of civil
prosecutions this year. And he predicted more criminal charges
against corporate executives.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>NASA said it has discovered more cracked equipment, this time in the
massive 1960s-vintage movers used to haul space shuttles to the
launch pads.</LD>
<LD>   Technicians at Cape Canaveral had just finished fixing fuel-line
cracks inside the shuttle Atlantis. The newest cracks are in the
bearings of the Apollo-era crawlers and could mean more launch
delays.</LD>
<LD>   Three small cracks in Atlantis' plumbing were fixed, putting the
shuttle on track for a launch as early as Sept. 28. But a crawler is
needed to get the shuttle from the hangar to the pad.</LD>
<TE>   The mission to add to the international space station was delayed
because of the fuel-line cracking, which grounded the shuttle fleet.</TE>

<LD>A man who disrupted a Christmas Day intercontinental flight by
shouting that the passengers would "burn in hell" was sentenced in
Miami to six months in prison.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Shelby Highsmith called Rodrigo Deambrosio's
actions "almost unforgivable" and said that if he had been on the
flight, he might have rushed the defendant himself.</LD>
<LD>   Deambrosio, 34, said that the American Airlines flight from New
York to Buenos Aires would end in a "fireball" and that everyone was
"going to die and burn in hell," a flight attendant testified. The
disruption forced the flight to be diverted to Miami.</LD>
<TE>   Deambrosio's attorney said her client, who pleaded guilty to
interfering with a flight crew, was under unusual stress compounded
by a fear of flying.</TE>

<HD>'Working Americans' to Tackle Economy</HD>
<DH>Politics: The president invites a diverse group to Texas to
discuss ways to revive U.S. How much attendees can help remains to be
seen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WACO, Texas</DL>
<LD>A diverse collection of chief executives, labor leaders,
small-business owners and homemakers will offer their ideas today on
how to revive the slumping economy at a forum billed as a listening
session for the Bush administration.</LD>
<LD>   But as the White House on Monday outlined the meeting's format, it
was unclear just how much of a contribution the 240 participants from
40 states--described as the "backbone of our economy"--will be able
to make to the debate or to a genuine search for fresh attempts to
cure the economy.</LD>
<LD>   The half-day forum begins with eight concurrent, 90-minute
sessions, chaired by Cabinet officers or other senior administration
officials and attended by about 30 people each.</LD>
<TE>   The topics: economic recovery and job creation, corporate
responsibility, small investors and retirement security, small
business and smarter regulation, education and workers, trade,
technology and innovation, and health-care security.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney each will drop in on four
sessions--and deliver remarks. (Bush is to attend four, and Cheney
another group of four.)</TE>
<TE>   But before any of the 30 "panel participants" can open a dialogue,
the sessions' chairs also will make remarks--as well as the guest
speakers. Five sessions have two chairs while a sixth has two guest
speakers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Plenary Session</TE>
<TE>   These sessions will be followed by an hourlong plenary session and
then a closing luncheon. Bush and Cheney are scheduled to greet the
participants at the lunch but will not stay for the meal, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   When asked whether the forum will allow a vigorous, free-flowing
discussion, White House Deputy Press Secretary Scott McClellan
replied: "Absolutely."</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, "the forum will include at least 14 hours of detailed
policy discussions," McClellan noted.</TE>
<TE>   The White House found itself on the defensive for having invited
some big Republican donors but no Democratic policymakers, such as
House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), who in January
called for an economic summit.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bush and the White House have emphasized the diversity of
the forum's participants, attention has focused on one subset: the
CEOs of companies that have donated generously to Republicans,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group.</TE>
<TE>   These include the heads of at least seven companies whose "soft
money" campaign donations in recent years have largely or exclusively
gone to Republicans: Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Caterpillar, Cisco Systems
Inc., Verizon Communications, Advanced Micro Devices Inc.,
International Paper Co. and Pfizer Inc.</TE>
<TE>   But other attendees, such as Douglas J. McCarron, the general
president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of
America, have backed Democrats, including Al Gore.</TE>
<TE>   Also among the participants are economists who worked for former
President Bush, father of the incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   These include Michael Boskin, now a Stanford University professor;
and Martin Feldstein, a Harvard University professor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'A Diversity of Views'</TE>
<TE>   One influential Democrat listed as a participant was Franklin D.
Raines, Fannie Mae's chairman and CEO who served as budget director
under President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   McClellan said that the forum's participants represent "a
diversity of views" and that Bush looks forward to hearing from
"people on the front lines of the American economy."</TE>
<TE>   The 240 "working Americans" including a handful from California,
were selected by the White House, with input from Bush's Cabinet,
McClellan said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that no political considerations were involved.</TE>
<TE>   Most participants are paying their own way to Waco even though,
given the official nature of the event, the government could have
legally picked up their travel expenses, according to McClellan.</TE>
<TE>   The forum will be held at Baylor University, about a half-hour
drive from Bush's 1,600-acre ranch near Crawford, where he is
spending the month of August, mixing work with vacation.</TE>
<TE>   The hastily arranged half-day forum is being staged in part to
showcase Bush's concern about the economy--and to shield him from
voter anger over the economic downturn and the stock market declines
that have reduced Americans' net worth by about 20%.</TE>
<TE>   As McClellan put it, parroting Bush's own mantra of late: "The
president focuses on our economy every day. And he's going to remain
concerned as long as there is one person who wants a job that cannot
find a job."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'More We Must Do'</TE>
<TE>   Still, McClellan conceded, Bush today will propose no new
initiatives--even though he acknowledged as recently as Saturday that
"there is more we must do."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Bush will renew his call on Congress to curb spending and
to enact further measures to protect pensions.</TE>
<TE>   As a way to underscore his concern about congressional spending
that could worsen the budget deficit, Bush is likely to announce at
the forum today that he will reject $5.1 billion in new spending
approved by Congress, White House aides said late Monday.</TE>
<TE>   But the president's move could antagonize lawmakers because the
spending package includes aid to Israel and Afghanistan, funds for
airport security and health monitoring at the former World Trade
Center site in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   The money is part of a $28.9-billion emergency spending package
that Bush signed on Aug. 2 and would be allocated if the president
authorized the disbursement by Sept. 1, or 30 days after the bill's
signing.</TE>
<TE>   Late last week, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) wrote Bush,
urging him to authorize the spending--and even offered to bring with
her to Bush's Texas ranch a contingent of New York City first
responders to personally make the case. But Bush did not take her up
on her offer.</TE>
<TE>   He also intends to demand swift congressional passage of his
controversial energy bill and a terrorism insurance bill that he
believes would encourage private construction projects to move
forward by providing government aid in insuring commercial
real-estate property against major loss from terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is likely to remind the public of several actions that he and
Congress have taken to boost the economy, such as the $1.35-trillion
tax cut, new authority for the president to more freely negotiate
trade agreements and a tough corporate accountability bill designed
to instill investor confidence.</TE>
<TE>   McClellan said the president also will emphasize what he has
repeatedly called the strong fundamentals of the economy: "strong
productivity growth, rising real wages, low and stable inflation, low
interest rates, low taxes."</TE>
<TE>   Among the forum's California participants are Diana Hoffman, head
of EnvironSystems), San Jose; Mario Rodriguez, head of Jonathan Grey
&amp; Associates, San Clemente; Bill Sharpe, chairman of Financial
Engines, Los Altos; and Maria de Lourdes Sobrino of Vernon, whom Bush
identified on Saturday as the owner of a successful Mexican food
production firm.</TE>

<HD>A Bovine 'Cure' for Ailing People</HD>
<DH>Science: Cattle have been genetically engineered to produce
human antibodies to treat a variety of diseases, researchers say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A growing herd of cloned calves may provide a variety of human
antibodies to treat diseases ranging from childhood ear infections to
smallpox, researchers said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The cloned and genetically engineered calves carry not just a
single human gene, but a section of genes that controls the
production of many different antibodies, a team at privately owned
Hematech reported.</LD>
<LD>   Jim Robl, a researcher who helped found South Dakota-based
Hematech, said he believed it was the largest chunk of genes ever
transferred from one species into another at once.</LD>
<TE>   "What we were excited about was the fact that we got a live calf
out of it," Robl said in a telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An Antibody Factory</TE>
<TE>   So far, the calves produce low levels of human antibodies, but
Robl said he thinks he can find ways to suppress their native immune
systems to produce more of the human product.</TE>
<TE>   Then, each cloned calf could be an antibody factory, he said,
producing a variety of products.</TE>
<TE>   His team first created an artificial piece of human chromosome
that carries the genes involved in making antibodies. The researchers
spliced this into skin cells from cattle, then cloned calves from
these genetically engineered cells.</TE>
<TE>   They have about 20 healthy male and female cloned calves that can
produce human antibodies in their blood, Robl said.</TE>
<TE>   The hope is to eventually have a herd of cattle that could be
infected with a range of viruses and bacteria, causing their bodies
to make antibodies to treat human disease, said the researcher, whose
work is published in the journal Nature Biotechnology.</TE>
<TE>   Antibodies are already widely used in medicine, one of the
best-known being the gamma globulin shot used against hepatitis. They
are also injected to treat immune deficiencies, tetanus and shingles.</TE>
<TE>   "They are also used as antitoxins--for example, snakebite toxins
and botulinum toxin" that causes food-borne botulism, Robl said.</TE>
<TE>   Antibodies are proteins that attach to specific invaders, such as
bacteria and viruses, to cancer cells or to a toxin. They can stop a
microbe or cell from functioning or can flag it for immune system
cells to come and destroy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Potential Uses</TE>
<TE>   One potential new use is against children's ear infections, Robl
said, by injecting a child with antibodies against the bacteria and
viruses that cause the infections, thus either supplementing
antibiotics, or working to prevent repeated infections.</TE>
<TE>   "Another area we are looking at is biodefense," Robl said, using
antibodies to protect against anthrax, smallpox, botulin toxin and
other possible biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The human antibody system allows the body to fight off new
infections without having seen them before. Genetically, it is
controlled by long sections of DNA that are cut up and recombined as
needed.</TE>
<TE>   Getting this long stretch of DNA into another animal's cell was
the first big step in the process, but Robl's team created an
artificial stretch of human chromosome that researchers were
eventually able to splice into the DNA of cattle skin cells. "We were
able to demonstrate that the chromosome is retained through all the
divisions necessary to make a live, healthy calf," Robl said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An activist pastor launched his write-in candidacy for the District
of Columbia's Democratic mayoral nomination on Monday, presenting a
new challenge for embattled Mayor Anthony Williams.</LD>
<LD>   "Mayor Williams was not the leader that we hoped for," said the
Rev. Willie Wilson, who presides over the 8,500-member Union Temple
Baptist Church.</LD>
<LD>   "There are people in every ward in this city who want a city that
responds to all of its citizens and not just some of its citizens,"
Wilson said during a half-hour speech. He launched his campaign in
the oratory style honed from the pulpit of the Anacostia area church
where he's been a minister for 29 years.</LD>
<TE>   Williams has been forced to mount a write-in campaign after
thousands of fraudulent signatures were found on his nominating
petitions and he lost a court challenge to be placed on the Sept. 10
primary ballot. The ballot will feature the names of four obscure
local Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson--appointed by Williams to the board of trustees of the
University of the District of Columbia--was an early supporter of
Williams four years ago, campaigning with the low-key bureaucrat in
predominantly black and working-class sections of the city.</TE>
<TE>   He now says he was prompted to enter the race in part because of
Williams' unsuccessful attempt to relocate the university, his
backing of the closure of the city's lone public hospital and his
efforts to replace the elected school board with a smaller elected
and appointed body.</TE>

<DH>Exploration: Advocates for the environment assail the Bush
administration's plan for the Canyons of the Ancients in Colorado.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration announced plans Monday to allow oil and gas
companies to expand beyond the boundaries of their leases at the
Canyons of the Ancients National Monument in southwest Colorado.</LD>
<LD>   It marks the first time exploration has been permitted to extend
outside leased areas at a monument.</LD>
<LD>   Environmental groups say the decision is one of the clearest
examples of the administration's policy of increasing energy
development on the nation's most-prized public lands.</LD>
<TE>   The Bureau of Land Management approved a seismic exploration
project to begin Friday at the Canyons of the Ancients near Durango,
allowing energy companies holding oil and gas leases at the monument
to delve into nearly 1,900 acres of unleased land.</TE>
<TE>   With about 85% of the 164,000-acre monument already leased for
energy exploration, the BLM said the new project will provide a
better map of the size and shape of the fossil fuel reserves under
the monument.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups counter that the encroachment into unleased
lands will not only do damage to sensitive biological and
archeological areas but set a dangerous precedent.</TE>
<TE>   "They are going to ... leave it wide open to development," said
Mark Pearson, executive director of the San Juan Citizens' Alliance,
a Durango group that monitors oil and gas issues on public land in
the area. "If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere. This
doesn't bode well for other monuments around the country."</TE>
<TE>   Pearson said his group would appeal the decision.</TE>
<TE>   LouAnn Jacobson, the monument's manager, said the new exploration
is the most equitable way to balance the preservation of
archeological sites and still allow lessees to drill.</TE>
<TE>   One goal is to prevent companies drilling on private land near the
monument from siphoning the oil and gas reservoirs that exist under
the BLM land, she said.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has made no secret of his goal of increasing energy
development on public lands. Expanding production at home, he argues,
will ease America's dependence on energy sources abroad.</TE>
<TE>   He wants to drill for oil and gas in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge, and his administration kept pushing for this even as national
environmental groups made it clear that killing the initiative was
their prime goal. The House approved a scaled-back development plan
for the region, but the Senate rejected it.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's priorities led the BLM to open an office to
increase energy production and make energy development a key factor
in weighing decisions on the use of public lands.</TE>
<TE>   Heidi McIntosh, conservation director for the Southern Utah
Wilderness Alliance, said her group is fighting similar energy
development near national parks and monuments in Utah. It's all part
of a step-by-step plan to change the complexion of public lands, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sensible way to manage public resources if you are
beholden to energy companies," McIntosh said. "This is the
administration's way to dismantle national monuments under the radar
screen. They are doing it this way because they know that the
American public would not allow this to happen, so they come at it in
the stealth mode. They are hoping the American public is not noticing
they are giving public lands away to the energy companies."</TE>
<TE>   Jacobson acknowledged that the exploration could be the first step
toward allowing more leasing in the Canyons of the Ancients monument,
which was established two years ago and is home to the highest
concentration of Anasazi archeological sites in the country.</TE>
<TE>   She said that before allowing new leases, there would be an
extensive review of the environmental effect of more drilling.</TE>
<TE>   The expanded exploration does not allow new drilling but will
bring "thumper trucks," 30-ton vehicles that place large steel pads
on the ground that send seismic waves deep below the surface. The
signal bounces back and creates a map of subterranean resources.</TE>
<TE>   The trucks and their support team, which includes four all-terrain
vehicles, are considered by environmental groups to be as damaging as
drilling platforms.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobson said the vehicles will use existing roads and trails
where possible. If the machines make more than a 3-inch indentation
in the soil, she said, the exploration will stop.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups warned that the monument's extensive
archeological sites could be imperiled by the new project. Jacobson
said an archeologist will be on hand to protect the ancient paintings
and dwellings.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing its decision, the agency cited two exceptions to the
monument's policy of not awarding new energy leases. One exception
allows for drilling in order to conserve oil and gas reservoirs
already in production. The other is to prevent drainage of oil and
gas.</TE>
<TE>   Theoretically, the newly leased areas would tap into these
underground reservoirs and capture the "leaking" oil or gas.</TE>
<TE>   The monument is a prodigious supplier of carbon dioxide, producing
272 billion cubic feet of the gas in 2000, which yielded $8.6 million
in royalties to the BLM. Carbon dioxide is sometimes injected into
aging oil fields to force crude oil to the surface.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000 the monument produced 210,400 barrels or oil and 2.1
billion cubic feet of gas.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobson said that the fate of the Canyons of the Ancients was
decided by the Clinton administration, which ensured energy
development would continue there. "The people have a right to develop
those areas," she said.</TE>

<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Gov. Jeb Bush choked up on the campaign trail Monday as he thanked
members of a Pentecostal church for their prayers for his daughter,
Noelle, who is in a drug treatment program.</LD>
<LD>   "Every time I think about my daughter, it's very hard," Bush said
after speaking at the Restoration Christian Center. "I appreciate the
fact that thousands of people are praying for her and praying for our
family. I know there are others ... going through similar things."</LD>
<LD>   Noelle Bush, 24, was arrested in January at a Tallahassee pharmacy
drive-through window for allegedly trying to buy the anti-anxiety
drug Xanax with a fraudulent prescription.</LD>
<TE>   A judge last month found her in contempt of court and sent her to
jail for three days after a worker at the center where she was
receiving court-ordered drug treatment found her carrying
prescription pills.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Bush fought back tears at a drug summit where he thanked
people for prayers and support after his daughter's arrest. He
quipped: "Bush men always cry; I apologize."</TE>
<TE>   Bush is unopposed for the Republican nomination for governor.
Former Atty. Gen. Janet Reno is seeking the nomination of the
Democratic Party.</TE>

<HD>Deposition of Boston Cardinal to Be Released</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Transcripts and videotapes are expected to be released today
detailing Cardinal Bernard Law's answers during a deposition on how
the Boston Archdiocese handled sexual abuse allegations against
Father Paul Shanley.</LD>
<LD>   The material covers two days of Law's deposition in May. The
beleaguered cardinal is also expected to be questioned today by
lawyers handling civil lawsuits against Shanley that accuse church
officials of negligence in failing to protect children.</LD>
<LD>   Shanley, 71, is accused of abusing boys from 1979 to 1989 while he
was a priest at a church in Newton, Mass. The retired priest has
pleaded not guilty to criminal charges of child rape, indecent
assault and battery.</LD>
<TE>   In court papers released Monday to attorneys in the civil cases,
Archdiocese lawyers said they plan to depose at least three people
later this month.</TE>
<TE>   The court papers provided to reporters did not identify the three,
but plaintiffs' attorney Roderick McLeish said they included a
13-year-old who was abused by Christopher Reardon, a former church
worker who pleaded guilty last year to child rape and other
molestation charges.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocesan spokeswoman Donna Morrissey said she would look into
the matter but had no immediate comment.</TE>
<TE>   The release of Law's transcripts and videotapes was delayed for
settlement talks between church officials and lawyers for the alleged
victims. The talks ended with no agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Shanley would take the boys out of class and
assault them in the rectory, the church bathroom or a confessional.</TE>
<TE>   Church personnel records released in April revealed that Law had
moved Shanley from parish to parish and wrote him a positive
retirement letter even though the archdiocese had received complaints
about him dating to 1967.</TE>
<TE>   Law also wrote Shanley a letter of recommendation for a post at a
California church in 1990 without telling officials there about the
abuse allegations.</TE>

<HD>Texas Court Won't Halt Mexican Citizen's Execution</HD>
<DH>Law: Home country of murderer is fighting to spare his
life. Fox calls punishment 'illegal.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A Texas appeals court refused to review the case of condemned Mexican
citizen Javier Suarez Medina on Monday, even as Mexican officials
promised to appeal his execution to the U.S. Supreme Court.</LD>
<LD>   Also Monday, Mexican President Vicente Fox released a letter sent
to Texas Gov. Rick Perry asking him to halt Suarez Medina's scheduled
execution and calling the punishment "illegal."</LD>
<LD>   Suarez Medina, 33, is to die by lethal injection Wednesday. He was
convicted in 1989 of killing a Dallas police narcotics officer.</LD>
<TE>   Suarez Medina's attorneys and the Mexican government had sought a
new trial or a sentence commutation to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   They say he was denied his right to contact the Mexican consulate,
as guaranteed by international treaty.</TE>
<TE>   But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the highest court in the
state for criminal cases, said he had made similar requests
previously.</TE>
<TE>   "He provided no justification or excuse for belatedly raising
claims, which he could have presented at an earlier time," said
Richard Wetzel, the court's general counsel.</TE>
<TE>   A request also is pending with the Texas Board of Pardons and
Paroles, which was not expected to make a recommendation to the Texas
governor until today.</TE>
<TE>   If that request is rejected, Mexico is prepared to immediately
file petitions with the U.S. Supreme Court alleging that execution of
Suarez Medina would violate international law, said Javier Manuel
Gomez-Robledo, legal advisor to Mexico's foreign relations secretary.
Mexico is asking for a stay or a 30-to 90-day reprieve.</TE>
<TE>   According to the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations,
which the United States signed, foreigners detained by U.S.
authorities must be told "without delay" that they can seek consulate
help.</TE>
<TE>   Fox said in his letter that the Mexican consulate may have
prevented the death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "For Mexico, the violation of the right to notifying the consulate
in this case gravely affected other basic rights to due legal
process," Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the clemency request, Mexican officials said they
will file a petition cosigned by nine other countries--Argentina,
Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay, Poland and
Uruguay--in support of Mexico's allegation that the execution
violates international law.</TE>
<TE>   "Texas should not be permitted to damage the United States'
relationship with its allies, invite international condemnation and
increase the danger that nationals detained abroad will be denied in
their time honored right to consular assistance and protection," a
copy of the petition states.</TE>

<HD>Ore. Blaze Held Back From Power Line</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GRANTS PASS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Firefighters battling the massive Sour Biscuit Fire got a line Monday
around a spot fire that threatened a major power line serving
Northern California as temperatures climbed to 100 degrees with dry
east winds.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think we'll have any reason to turn the power off and
cause any problems down in Crescent City," said U.S. Forest Service
spokesman Mike Ferris.</LD>
<LD>   The spot fire had jumped over the main containment line on the
southeastern flank near O'Brien, coming within a half-mile of two
transmission lines serving 14,800 customers in Del Norte County, said
Monte Mendenhall of Pacific Power.</LD>
<TE>   "This week is an important week for the fire," said Susan
Mathison, a Forest Service spokeswoman. "High temperatures,
single-digit humidities, strong east winds--all those contribute to
an expectation of increased fire activity."</TE>
<TE>   The fire, Oregon's largest in more than a century, stood at
376,492 acres on the Siskiyou National Forest and adjoining lands in
southwestern Oregon and northern California. It started July 13 from
lighting that struck in the remote Kalmiopsis Wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   To fight the fire, authorities have deployed 6,100 firefighters
and support staff in three separate units based in Gold Beach, Selma
and Brookings.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was formerly known as the Florence Fire. Full containment
for the southern flank in California was expected by Thursday. The
fire was 25% contained.</TE>
<TE>   "The fire isn't spreading that much," said fire spokesman Mike
Ferris. "It's creeping against the wind along the ridges and down the
slopes, then running up the other side."</TE>
<TE>   On the northern flank, Ferris said the threat was reduced to the
community of Agness, home to about 150 people and a center of
whitewater rafting on the Rogue River. Firefighters planned to do a
major burnout south of the Bear Camp Road toward Indigo Prairie to
strengthen protection for the community. A fire retardant plan was
installed to supply helicopters fighting the fire.</TE>
<TE>   On the western flank, the fire crept within about four miles of
the community of Wilderness Retreat, where all but a few of about 40
residents have heeded a voluntary evacuation notice, Mathison said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile a new blaze, the Bald Green Butte fire, erupted Sunday
in eastern Oregon, about 17 miles northwest of Burns.</TE>

<HD>5 Held in Alleged Immigrant Child Smuggling Ring</HD>
<DH>Crime: Hundreds of youths were exploited in the
multimillion-dollar effort, the INS says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE MUNN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Immigration and Naturalization Service announced Monday that it
had broken up a multimillion-dollar smuggling ring that took
advantage of the desperation of parents living illegally in the
United States to have their children join them.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador were
smuggled through Mexico, into Los Angeles, and then throughout the
United States, the INS said.</LD>
<LD>   The ring, which began operations in 1994, charged $5,000 for each
child, the INS said--a fortune for men and women who would be lucky
if they earned even minimum wage in the United States. The children
ranged from 18 months to 17 years of age.</LD>
<TE>   "After years of earning enormous profits on the backs of innocent
children by exploiting their desperation and exploiting their very
fear, this ring of vultures is now shut down," said Johnny Williams,
INS executive assistant commissioner for field operations, at a news
conference in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   INS agents were tipped off to the ring on April 5, when Guatemalan
authorities intercepted seven buses bound from El Salvador for the
United States. They found 53 children, who tearfully told authorities
they were hungry and had been forced to sleep on the floor of hotel
lobbies, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a multinational investigation that has broken what we
believe is the largest child smuggling ring we have ever
encountered," Williams said. "This was not a humanitarian operation
built on any shred of compassion. It was a mean-spirited criminal
enterprise, driven by greed and criminal profit."</TE>
<TE>   He said the probe, dubbed Operation White Fields, is continuing.</TE>
<TE>   While most of the children expected to be reunited with their
parents, who were already living--often illegally--in the United
States, some were brought in for work or, to a lesser degree, for
"exploitation," INS spokesman Russell Bergeron said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the INS and the U.S. attorney's office in Washington
said Monday that they would decide on a case-by-case basis whether to
return the rescued children to their home countries and whether to
prosecute or deport their parents.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation involved INS officers in El Salvador, Guatemala,
Honduras and Mexico, as well as those in Washington, Los Angeles and
Houston. Also participating were law enforcement agencies in El
Salvador and Guatemala.</TE>
<TE>   Berta Campos, the alleged ringleader, was arrested in Los Angeles
on July 15 and accused of arranging to smuggle a youth identified
only as "G.L.A.M." for $5,000, plus $60 for expenses.</TE>
<TE>   A second suspect, Guillermo Antonio Paniagua, was arrested in
Houston on June 13. The indictment alleges that two months earlier,
Paniagua met a 15-year-old boy identified only as "J.A.R." at a hotel
in San Salvador, El Salvador's capital, to arrange to smuggle him
into the U.S., then pocketed half of the $5,000 fee.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, agents arrested three more suspects in Houston--Ana
Karina Cruz Rivas, Juan Orlando Servellon De Leon and Andrea Giron.
They and Paniagua were expelled from Guatemala before their arrest,
the INS said.</TE>
<TE>   All five, who are El Salvador nationals, are charged with
conspiracy to smuggle illegal immigrants, which carries a penalty of
as much as 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in El Salvador also arrested seven people there, but
the U.S. Department of Justice has no immediate plans to seek
extradition, said Channing Phillips, chief of staff for the U.S.
attorney's office in Washington, on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Marshals Service is transferring Campos from Los Angeles
to Washington for her arraignment. A hearing for Paniagua is set for
Wednesday in Washington, and the other three suspects arrested in the
U.S. will have hearings in Texas today, Phillips said.</TE>

<HD>Uribe Widens War on Rebels</HD>
<DH>Colombia: New leader, having declared a state of emergency
and planning a military buildup, is expected to announce further
moves this week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>President Alvaro Uribe moved quickly Monday to take advantage of
sweeping powers granted him under a state of emergency, opening a new
front in the battle against the hemisphere's oldest insurgency.</LD>
<LD>   Having declared the state of emergency, which took effect just
after midnight on Monday, Uribe immediately enacted new taxes to pay
for more soldiers and police. He was expected to announce further
measures later this week that could include restrictions on citizens'
movements, detentions without warrants and removal of judicial
oversight of wiretaps.</LD>
<LD>   The emergency decree is a concrete sign of Uribe's determination
to confront Colombia's leftist rebels, who have waged a campaign
against the government for nearly four decades. It also signals the
first time in recent history that the full weight of the Colombian
government, supported by the United States, will be applied against
the guerrilla groups.</LD>
<TE>   "The government and Colombian society must quickly recover
national security, now that the violent ones have become more
aggressive and more destructive," said Interior and Justice Minister
Fernando Londono in announcing the state of emergency after a
six-hour meeting that ended early Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe gained special powers for a limited period of time to enact
laws to prosecute the nation's internal conflict, which pits the
rebels against government forces and right-wing paramilitaries. While
the state of emergency could equally be used to fight the
paramilitaries--who are responsible for the majority of massacres in
the conflict--the focus Monday was on the guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   The state of emergency comes on the heels of a determined rebel
offensive since Uribe won election in May on promises of a military
crackdown. Rebels have threatened to execute mayors and other
democratically elected officials. They have blown up bridges and
electricity towers.</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, authorities blamed urban guerrillas for launching
homemade missiles against the presidential palace during Uribe's
inauguration. Twenty-one people were killed, authorities say, most of
them indigents living in a nearby neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Using his extraordinary powers, Uribe immediately imposed a 1.2%
tax Monday on the country's richest individuals and companies, an
estimated 400,000 taxable entities with liquid assets of about
$60,000 or more.</TE>
<TE>   The government hopes the tax will raise nearly $800 million to pay
for two new mobile army brigades, 10,000 new police officers and a
controversial program to create 100,000 citizen informants, who will
be paid for their services.</TE>
<TE>   Other measures that might be imposed under the state of emergency
include new laws that would make it easier to go after guerrilla
finances and property; requirements for citizens to register their
movements with local authorities; and restrictions on the media and
public demonstrations.</TE>
<TE>   The new taxes are in line with U.S. demands that Colombia pay more
for its war effort before receiving additional aid. The U.S. has
provided more than $1.7 billion in the last two years, with much of
that money now going to fund Colombia's war effort.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe's decision to declare the state of emergency, which must be
approved by the country's Constitutional Court, received support from
nearly every faction of society, an indication of a new willingness
to confront the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the
country's largest guerrilla group.</TE>
<TE>   Business leaders indicated a willingness to pay new taxes. Human
rights officials accepted the necessity of restrictions on
constitutional guarantees. Political leaders on the right and left
expressed support.</TE>
<TE>   Since the country enacted a new constitution in 1991, five other
states of emergency have been declared, but Monday marked the first
time a president had issued such a decree so soon after taking
office.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Carlos Gaviria, who as a Constitutional Court justice
nullified a state of emergency declaration in 1995 and is now part of
the leftist opposition, said Uribe's decision was fully justified.</TE>
<TE>   He brushed aside fears that Uribe was using the declaration to
gain dictatorial powers, as has happened frequently in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   The state of emergency can last only 180 days and be extended an
additional 90 only with congressional approval.</TE>
<TE>   "Uribe's proposals are authoritarian," Gaviria said. "But I have
always said that I expect his government to be authoritarian, not
fascist."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some expressed worry that Uribe is taking a dangerous road
toward dictatorial control--and continued violence.</TE>
<TE>   The state of emergency comes after a referendum introduced last
week by Uribe to weaken congressional powers. If passed, it would
reduce the number of representatives, restrict Congress' power of the
purse and allow the national legislature to be dissolved by popular
vote.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe also did not rule out arming some of the newly created
government informants, raising fears that they could go out of
control. When he was a provincial governor, Uribe created citizen
militia groups that were later accused of paramilitary violence.</TE>
<TE>   "All of this is only going to polarize the country and make the
conflict worse," said Ana Teresa Bernal, head of one of Colombia's
largest peace groups. "What we are fearing is that the most affected
will be the civilian population."</TE>
<TE>   The new measures could also result in a clash between the
executive and judicial branches. In the past, the high court has
insisted on the right to pass judgment on the validity of a state of
emergency declaration.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, when the court annulled the state of emergency in
1995, then-President Ernesto Samper had declared the country under
siege by guerrillas and narcotics traffickers. The court ruled that
this was normal in Colombia and that it didn't merit extraordinary
powers.</TE>
<TE>   But Londono, Uribe's confrontational new justice and interior
minister, insisted Monday that the court did not have the right to
review the new president's declaration.</TE>
<TE>   Constitutional experts downplayed the possibility of an impasse,
saying that the court would probably insist on the right to review
the decree and then agree that the country's crisis is sufficiently
grave to merit a state of emergency.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a political solution that also represents reality," said
Jorge Enrique Ivanez, director of postgraduate law studies at
Javeriana University.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the fear over the declaration stems from history. Prior to
the 1991 constitution, which limited presidential powers, Colombian
presidents frequently used--and abused--a statute creating a state of
siege.</TE>
<TE>   The country was under an official state of siege almost
continuously for nearly 40 years before 1991, allowing presidents to
issue laws, manipulate Congress and suspend constitutional rights.</TE>
<TE>   But those worries have partly been assuaged by the current
declaration, which limits, but does not suspend, constitutional
rights and has fixed time limits.</TE>
<TE>   "It raises alarm bells, but this step in itself is not at all
surprising, nor is it all that troubling," said Jason Hagen, Colombia
expert for the Washington Office on Latin America, a left-leaning
group that promotes human rights and democracy in the region. "He has
the right to do this."</TE>

<HD>Police Have Hands Full in Kosovo</HD>
<DH>Balkans: Organized crime threatens stability of province,
leading U.N. to bolster its operation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia</DL>
<LD>It's hard to find a fully legitimate product here on the streets of
Kosovo's capital. Right across from the main police station, vendors
sell the latest bootlegged DVD movies and young boys hawk smuggled
cigarettes and phone cards.</LD>
<LD>   Less visible but more worrisome, officials say, are the smuggled
oil, guns and trafficked women--and the corruption in government
agencies that helps such illegal trade flourish.</LD>
<LD>   Few international officials would have included economic crimes as
a major problem confronting this majority ethnic Albanian province of
Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia, after the devastation it
experienced at the hands of Serbian security forces in the late
1990s. But as the number of ethnically motivated attacks declines,
organized crime poses the biggest threat to Kosovo's future
stability, according to law enforcement officials, Kosovo
businesspeople and independent observers.</LD>
<TE>   Although it is extremely difficult to measure how much of Kosovo's
economy is tainted by illegality, some of the province's business
officials say it could be as much as 70%.</TE>
<TE>   Belatedly recognizing the problem, officials with the U.N. mission
in Kosovo who control the law enforcement effort here are beefing up
their attack on organized crime.</TE>
<TE>   They're refining witness protection laws, approved only recently,
and trying to obtain wiretapping equipment so they can capitalize on
a new regulation allowing clandestine eavesdropping.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Zero Tolerance'</TE>
<TE>   They're bringing in more international judges and, in the most
recent move, announced late last month, have recruited 10 members of
the Italian financial police--experts in investigating Mafia-style
business ventures--to help the international and local police force.</TE>
<TE>   "We have adopted a zero tolerance for crime," said Michael
Steiner, the top U.N. official in Kosovo. "It is one of our top
priorities."</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of the problems faced by law enforcement officials is
everywhere. Even some of the heating oil sold here is smuggled--it
comes in huge trucks through illegal border crossings and, in one
case, through an illegal pipeline that was discovered and shut down,
only to reappear nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Other illegal activities, such as trafficking in women as well as
the trade in narcotics and guns, are a continuing problem in Kosovo,
still nominally part of Serbia and of the larger Yugoslav federation.
Prosecutors and international officials also count rampant protection
rackets and corruption of government-owned ventures, such as the
electrical utility, as growing problems.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, such activities are nothing new to the Balkans, and
Kosovo is hardly unique. Similar problems plague all of Serbia, as
well as neighbors Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. But analysts say
that the U.N. authority, preoccupied with ethnic violence, was slow
to get international police on the ground and even slower to get
international judges and prosecutors in place.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the lessons of the Balkans is that ... the rule of law
isn't something you can leave until last," said Daniel Serwer, the
director of the Balkans Initiative at the U.S. Institute of Peace in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "Criminality is the main threat now to the institutions in
Kosovo," he said. "The U.N. has to learn how to move faster. Now,
after three years, they finally have a lot of the mechanisms in
place, but it's harder now--the criminals have had that time to get
embedded."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Serwer noted, the U.N. has done a better job in Kosovo than
in Bosnia, where it has taken almost six years to move forward the
process of reforming the often corrupt judiciary.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Multiethnic Venture</TE>
<TE>   In fact, law enforcement officials face an ironic problem: Crime
is one of the few multiethnic ventures in Kosovo, a region where most
Serbs and Albanians never speak to one another.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the groups arrested for trafficking in women, for
instance, have involved representatives of both ethnicities.</TE>
<TE>   But the task of building crime-fighting institutions from scratch
is more difficult than originally anticipated. It requires creating
an effective police force and court system and writing laws that
target the increasingly sophisticated criminal activity in the
province.</TE>
<TE>   Until this year, for instance, there were no witness protection
laws that allowed people to testify without being identified or any
provisions to allow reduced charges in exchange for testimony--a
standard law enforcement tool in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem of organized crime wasn't really appreciated when the
United Nations mission in Kosovo was built up," said Anthony Ricci, a
former prosecutor from Massachusetts, one of a small cadre of
international attorneys drafted by the U.N. administration to help
bring difficult cases in the province.</TE>
<TE>   "The number of murders in 1999, when the U.N. got here, was
overwhelming," Ricci said, adding, "No one was going to stop a few
oil shipments."</TE>
<TE>   For the last two years, the U.N. has been recruiting and training
a police force from the ethnic Albanian population, but it takes time
to create professionalism.</TE>
<TE>   Augmenting the nearly 5,000 newly minted ethnic Albanian police
officers are about 4,000 international police officers from U.N.
countries. The international police presence, however, has its own
problems. None of the international officers speaks Albanian, the
language of most residents of the province.</TE>
<TE>   And there is open scorn among Kosovo Albanians toward those
members of the international police from Africa and Asia--who look
utterly unlike the more familiar Europeans and Americans and whose
cultures are largely alien to Kosovars.</TE>
<TE>   "People only trust the local [ethnic Albanian] police officers,
and they also trust the U.S. cops who are working with us, but when
it comes to these cops sent from Asia or India, nobody will talk to
them," said Xhemajl Ademi, an Albanian police officer in charge of
the large Western Pristina district.</TE>
<TE>   Further undermining the police is a long-standing suspicion of law
enforcement dating from the days when it was dominated by Serbs, who
were often abusive to the Kosovo Albanians, said Derek Chappell, the
spokesman for the U.N. police force.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the problem here is that the police have not been a
friend of the people," he said. "They've been brutal and corrupt and
ethnically motivated."</TE>
<TE>   Privately, U.N. officials say one of the other obstacles they face
is the popular support for former members of the Albanian guerrilla
force, the Kosovo Liberation Army, some of whom are now involved in
illegal activities. There is constant pressure to put them in
high-ranking political jobs, and prosecution of their misdeeds is
viewed by some ethnic Albanians as persecution, two law enforcement
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Steiner admits that the police need to become more sophisticated
and noted in a recent television interview that the criminals have
high-tech means of communication, which presumably help them avoid
police detection.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to violent crime, Chappell said, the statistics are
encouraging. Incidents are declining sharply, with the exception of
rape and assault--both of which have risen because of increased
reporting, he said. Another partial success story is the U.N.
mission's customs service, which has been increasingly effective as
its officers begin to use informants and have a more visible presence
on the roads, said John Robertson, director of intelligence and
investigation for the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Income from customs tariffs, the primary revenue source for the
provincial government, more than doubled between 2000 and 2001 to
roughly the equivalent of $243.4 million and is on track to increase
again this year.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Robertson said, his officers probably intercept
considerably less than a quarter of the total smuggled goods.</TE>
<TE>   Fueling the economic crime problem is widespread
unemployment--57%, according to U.N. statistics--and low pay in many
job sectors, making crime a more attractive choice than legitimate
employment, especially for young people.</TE>
<TE>   "In the absence of clear anti-criminal laws and [given] the lack
of jobs, the gray economy is becoming the true economy of Kosovo,"
said Ismail Kastrati, the president of the Kosovo Chamber of
Commerce, who estimates that as much as 70% of Kosovo's business is
not completely legitimate. "It is more efficient and much more
profitable, and so the legal economy loses ground."</TE>
<TE>   An Albanian police officer is paid between $200 and $250 s month.
Investigating judges, who play the role that a grand jury would
usually play in the United States, are paid $400 a month. By
contrast, oil smugglers can make the equivalent of $50,000 per truck
of oil smuggled into the country, according to Robertson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Special Species'</TE>
<TE>   Kastrati said he and other business colleagues recently warned a
friend who wanted to get into the import business to stay away from
it.</TE>
<TE>   "We told him: 'The people who import these things will not talk to
you, they all know each other, they are a special species. If you try
to do things the legal way, you will have no chance; if you try to do
them the illegal way, you won't stand a chance either because you
don't have friends in the right circles.' "</TE>
<TE>   If Kosovo is eventually to become self-governing, however, it will
have to reduce the criminality, Steiner said. Prime Minister Bajram
Rexhepi is a strong supporter of more aggressive measures, especially
to stop smuggling, and there is some indication that public opinion
supports his view.</TE>
<TE>   In the most hopeful sign on the horizon, a new program on local
television modeled along the lines of the show "America's Most
Wanted" and the British show "Crimewatch" appears to be succeeding in
eliciting citizens' help in solving crimes.</TE>
<TE>   After the first broadcast, the police were flooded with calls,
suggesting that the distrust of law enforcement is finally on the
wane. About 100 people phoned with tips about crimes in their
neighborhoods as well the crimes depicted on the show, which included
the assassination of a farmer and the killing of a policeman.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fantastic," Chappell said. "We know a lot of people are
afraid to come to the police, and we were wondering if we would get a
single phone call. We got 100 calls, and the information we got has
us well on the way to solving some of the crimes featured."</TE>

<HD>Overhaul May Loom for Airlines</HD>
<DH>Transportation: US Airways' bankruptcy filing could result
in reduced flight schedules and staffing and higher costs for
travelers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>US Airways' bankruptcy filing sparked new worries about the airline
industry's worsening financial condition, as investors sent carriers'
stock prices plunging Monday. Speculation also grew that giant United
Airlines also may seek a bankruptcy restructuring.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said US Airways' filing could trigger a string of
long-overdue events that eventually might strengthen the loss-ridden
industry, although at the cost of making air travel more expensive
and less convenient for passengers. The changes also could prompt
some airlines to merge in order to better compete, analysts added.</LD>
<LD>   Across the country, passengers were largely unaffected Monday, the
day after the filing. US Airways' flights from Los Angeles
International Airport to East Coast destinations were said to be
running full or nearly full and without unusual delays. The
Arlington, Va.-based airline--the nation's seventh-largest--operates
10 daily departures from LAX.</LD>
<TE>   US Airways said its service, currently 3,800 flights daily to 204
cities, would continue uninterrupted as it works with creditors and
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to mend its finances. The airline told a
bankruptcy judge in Alexandria, Va., on Monday that it hopes to
emerge from its reorganization within six to eight months.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Robert Mayer on Monday cleared the way for the airline to
maintain its operations, partly by allowing the carrier to tap $75
million of a $500-million financing package it negotiated with two
lenders.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways filed for bankruptcy protection--becoming the first
major airline to do so since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks--in part
to make it easier for the company to win concessions from its
creditors and employees, and to effectively shrink the carrier to
make it profitable again, analysts said. If US Airways is successful,
pressure could increase on other airlines to seek lower labor costs
or reduce their size to better match their business to the lackluster
level of passenger traffic, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, United and any other airline struggling to gain
concessions from its employees can say "bankruptcy is a real,
credible alternative, because look at the example of US Airways,"
said Alec Ostrow, a bankruptcy lawyer in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Once the airlines' size and costs are more in line with travel
demand, Ostrow added, the carriers also might be able to nudge fares
higher and generate more income per passenger.</TE>
<TE>   "There will certainly be an effect in the industry and on
consumers," Ostrow said. "It's going to affect consumers in terms of
decreased competition and a decreased ability to choose routes, times
and carriers."</TE>
<TE>   But Ostrow and others agree that most other major
airlines--American, Delta, Northwest, Continental and Southwest--are
not in immediate danger of needing Bankruptcy Court protection.</TE>
<TE>   The industry, which lost more than $7 billion last year, already
was slumping before the terrorist attacks sharply curtailed travel.
Despite huge cutbacks in flights after the attacks, the carriers are
still flying more seats than there are passengers, forcing them to
cut fares even though most airlines' costs--especially their labor
expenses--remain high.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was especially acute at US Airways, which filed under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In Chapter 11, a company
continues to operate but is protected from creditors' claims while it
designs a restructuring plan.</TE>
<TE>   Once a company enters Chapter 11 and starts negotiating with its
creditors over the future of the business, it's hard to predict what
changes might occur. It's not uncommon for an airline to close or
sell aircraft, routes, landing slots and other assets to survive. In
the early 1990s, for instance, now-defunct Pan American World Airways
sold its sprawling European service to Delta Air Lines while in
bankruptcy proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Now there's another big player in the equation: Uncle Sam.</TE>
<TE>   A total of $10 billion in loan guarantees was made available as
part of the post-Sept. 11 federal bailout of the airlines. US Airways
and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines applied to the Air Transportation
Stabilization Board, the agency overseeing the program, for loan
guarantees of $900 million and $1.8 billion respectively.</TE>
<TE>   To win the loan guarantees they need to raise cash from
lenders--and to trim losses--US Airways and United Airlines are
seeking massive employee concessions. The ATSB expects an applicant's
workers, suppliers and creditors to make concessions to help the
airline repay the loans and thus protect U.S. taxpayers' interests.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways has made good progress on that front but decided it
needed the Bankruptcy Court's help to finish its restructuring.</TE>
<TE>   But a growing number of analysts fear that United won't get the
loan guarantees because too few of its workers have agreed to pay
cuts, which could force the carrier to seek bankruptcy protection as
well.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no confidence in the company's ability to avoid
bankruptcy," analyst James Higgins of Credit Suisse First Boston said
in a recent report.</TE>
<TE>   United has some of the highest labor costs in the industry, "and
in the current environment it's out of sync with the market," in
which inroads are being made by lower-cost, lower-fare airlines such
as Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways, said Michael Allen, of
Back Aviation Solutions, an industry consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   United spokesman Chris Brathwaite said, "Anybody who's speculating
one way or the other is not as closely involved with the situation as
we are. We're clearly focused on our recovery, getting a handle on
our costs and working with the ATSB to secure a loan guarantee."</TE>
<TE>   And just as some predicted, the three-member ATSB board could
almost single-handedly reshape the airline business, depending on
whether it grants the guarantees to the two carriers. The ATSB rules
do allow for loan guarantees even if the airline is in bankruptcy
proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Having airlines in bankruptcy at the same time they're seeking
government aid "is unprecedented territory" for the industry, said
Thomas Boland, a managing director of Seneca Financial Group, who
helped a smaller carrier, America West Airlines, get a loan guarantee
from the ATSB early this year, the only one granted so far by the
agency.</TE>
<TE>   ATSB spokeswoman Betsy Holahan said the agency was still reviewing
the requests from United and US Airways and that no date had been set
for a decision.</TE>
<TE>   Investors didn't wait: They sold airline stocks with abandon
Monday. Shares of UAL plummeted $1.40, or 27%, to $3.80 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street now values the entire company--which has 84,000
employees, 560 aircraft, $17 billion in annual revenue and is the
nation's second-largest airline behind AMR Corp.'s American--at just
$291 million, about the price of two jetliners. And United's
employees own 55% of the airline's stock.</TE>
<TE>   AMR tumbled $1.23, or 13%, to $8.36 a share, and the American
Stock Exchange's index of all airline stocks lost 3.86 points, or
7.6%, to 47.17. The NYSE didn't open trading in US Airways' stock in
light of the bankruptcy filing Sunday; the stock closed at $2.45 a
share Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation that United might file for bankruptcy protection was
fed by Chief Executive Jack Creighton, who told employees that the
government probably would reject its loan-guarantee application
without more worker cutbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gotten the clear feeling that we need more participation
from all of our stakeholders in our cost-cutting efforts," he said in
a recorded message. "They have indicated to us that participation
must be broader, deeper and longer."</TE>
<TE>   But among United's unionized workers, only its pilots have agreed
to givebacks. And while United has more than $2 billion of cash on
hand, it's still losing at least $1 million a day and faces upcoming
debt payments that could wipe out much of that cushion.</TE>
<TE>   Some argue that United should try to raise the cash on its own,
but United says its access to the capital markets is severely
restricted because of its deteriorating financial condition, and so
it needs the federal loan guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   But the ATSB will find that a hard sell unless United first proves
it's won major concessions, said Boland of Seneca Financial. "Given
the problems in the industry, it's difficult to put together a case
that shows you can repay a loan if you've got a high cost structure."</TE>

<HD>Flashlight Feud Casts a Shadow</HD>
<DH>A court battle over industry supremacy illuminates a family
fight pitting the Maglite magnate against rivals he helped raise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They called it the world's best flashlight, a plastic torch so bright
it could illuminate the gloomiest of caves or the darkest mountain
trail on a moonless night.</LD>
<LD>   Through clever engineering, brothers Stephen and Christopher
Halasz claimed to have solved the eternal puzzle of the "black
hole"--that dark spot that appears in the center of flashlight beams.
Their Bison Sportslight, they said, surpassed even the legendary
Maglite, the black aluminum icon of flashlights and the industry
standard for more than a decade.</LD>
<LD>   The Maglite was not just any competitor. Its inventor, Tony
Maglica, was a father figure to the brothers and their mother's
live-in companion for more than 20 years. The Halasz brothers grew up
idolizing Maglica and followed him into the flashlight business.</LD>
<TE>   The relationship was shattered when their mother broke up with
Maglica and sued him for $200 million in palimony. So when the
brothers formed their own company to develop a rival flashlight five
years ago, Maglica declared war.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt betrayed," said Maglica, 72. "I raised these boys for much
of their lives. I paid for all their education. What happened here I
wouldn't expect in a million years to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Out of this family feud came a business fraud lawsuit that is part
physics lesson and part soap opera. It pitted two upstarts against a
man considered by many the Bill Gates of the flashlight industry.</TE>
<TE>   Maglica says he went to court to protect Maglite's reputation
as the top dog of flashlights and to debunk the brothers' claim that
they had eliminated the irksome "black hole."</TE>
<TE>   But Stephen Halasz sees a more personal motive. "A lot of what's
going on here is just residual bitterness from the battle he had with
my mother," he said. "I always thought Tony and my mother would be
able to work things out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was little more than a decade ago that Maglica and the Halasz
brothers were sharing meals together at Maglica's Anaheim Hills home
and working side-by-side at the Mag Instrument factory in Ontario,
where workers turned out flashlight cases on enormous industrial
lathes.</TE>
<TE>   Maglica had lived with the brothers' mother, Claire, since the
early 1970s. She was an interior designer whom Maglica had hired to
decorate his machine shop. Although they weren't married, Claire took
Maglica's last name, and they were known as husband and wife to
Orange County's social and political elite.</TE>
<TE>   Hobnobbing with presidents Ronald Reagan and the elder George
Bush, the couple became generous patrons of the Republican Party and
made headlines in 1993 when they financed the rescue of a blind boy,
his mother and his sister from Bosnia and brought the boy to
California for medical care.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Maglica was born in New York, but grew up on a small island
off the coast of Yugoslavia. He returned to the United States in 1950
and went to work in a machine shop in California. He went into
business for himself a few years later, making precision tool parts
in his Ontario garage.</TE>
<TE>   After churning out machine parts for the aerospace industry and
the military, Maglica produced his first premium flashlight in 1979.
Heavy, well-machined and sleekly styled, the device was an instant hit
with police officers, who loved its superior illumination and shell of
aircraft-grade metal.</TE>
<TE>   "The Maglite revolutionized field police work," said
Roy Huntington, a former San Diego cop and editor of American Handgunner,
a magazine for firearms enthusiasts. "You could use it to bash out
the side window of a car or a cretin on the head."</TE>
<TE>   The Maglite became as standard a piece of equipment as an
officer's handcuffs and revolver.</TE>
<TE>   "You could always tell a veteran street cop by his flashlight,"
Huntington said. "They'd have nicks and dents where an officer had
used it to bash open a door or had dropped it off a roof in a
scuffle. It was a mark of office."</TE>
<TE>   The flashlight spread to the general public, particularly when the
company introduced the smaller Mini Maglite. The privately held
company now has more than 800 employees and had sales of nearly $70
million last year.</TE>
<TE>   The Halasz brothers shared in Maglica's success and basked in his
affection. He regarded them as sons, and they regarded him as their
stepfather.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers accompanied Maglica when he unveiled the first
Maglite at an industry trade show in Las Vegas in 1980. On their
summer breaks from high school and college, Maglica taught them the
business from the ground up.</TE>
<TE>   Claire Maglica also worked for Mag Instrument, running the
company's personnel, marketing and purchasing operations from a desk
next to Maglica's.</TE>
<TE>   When the Halasz brothers finished graduate school, Maglica gave
them positions of responsibility in his company. Christopher, now 45
and an engineer, worked as Mag's director of research and
development. Stephen, now 47, was a vice president and later Mag's
outside legal counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Maglica said they were privy to the company's most guarded
secrets.</TE>
<TE>   "I trusted Stephen with all my personal information," Maglica
recalled. "He knew everything about me, like a doctor."</TE>
<TE>   Tony and Claire's relationship ended abruptly in 1992. She learned
that he planned to leave the company to his children from a previous
marriage. She confronted him.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'What business is it of yours?' I said, 'I'm your wife,'
and he said to me, 'You got a piece of paper to prove it?' " Claire
Maglica later recounted in court. "I said, 'If I'm not your wife,
then what am I?' He said, 'You're my employee.' "</TE>
<TE>   The rift developed into a bitter palimony suit that was televised
nationwide on Court TV. Claire insisted that she had helped build up
Mag Instrument from a hole-in-the-wall machine shop to an
internationally known company.</TE>
<TE>   The sons were caught in the middle. Stephen Halasz never again
handled any of the company's legal work. Christopher Halasz, too,
soon left the firm.</TE>
<TE>   "He was left in an office where no one would talk to him," his
brother said. "The other employees were terrified to be seen with
him. Our side of the family was out."</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, a jury in Santa Ana awarded Claire $84 million in
palimony, but an appeals court overruled the decision. In 2000, she
settled for $29 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With their ties to Mag Instrument severed, the Halasz brothers
decided to start their own flashlight business near Denver in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   They set their sights on creating the perfect flashlight, even
better than Maglica's.</TE>
<TE>   The flaw they saw in the Maglite--and the vast majority of other
flashlights on the market--is the black hole created when light
emanates from the bulb. This is a particular problem with high-end
flashlights whose adjustable beams allow users to direct light at a
narrow area or flood it across a larger space.</TE>
<TE>   "The black hole ... [has] plagued adjustable flashlights since the
dawn of time," said Craig Johnson, a Seattle flashlight aficionado
who operates a Web site (ledmuseum.home.att.net) that displays
reviews and ratings for hundreds of models.</TE>
<TE>   The black hole is barely noticed by most flashlight users. But in
the industry, finding a way to close it is akin to searching for the
Holy Grail. Many--including Maglica--say it's impossible.</TE>
<TE>   The Halasz brothers maxed out their credit cards to get their
company off the ground. They cast several molds for flashlight
prototypes and used them to lure investors. After two years of
engineering and testing, they said they had found a way to eliminate
the black hole.</TE>
<TE>   The source of the hole is the flashlight's reflector, a
silver-coated structure surrounding the lightbulb. In flashlights
with adjustable lenses, most of the settings cause light to stream
unevenly from the reflector, creating a doughnut-like pattern.</TE>
<TE>   Most reflectors have a curved, parabolic shape. Typically, they
are wide and shallow, like an inverted dome. The Halaszes' reflector
looks more like the letter C, with a deeper shape and more steeply
slanted sides. The brothers say this evens out the flow of light and
eliminates the black hole for nearly all lens settings.</TE>
<TE>   The purported advance is documented in pages of complex
mathematical formulas introduced as evidence in court.</TE>
<TE>   The Bison Sportslight hit the market roughly three years ago,
selling for $25.</TE>
<TE>   Though the brothers billed it as the world's best flashlight,
Stephen Halasz said they marketed the Bison to outdoorsmen to avoid
head-to-head competition with Maglica. They also made the flashlights
out of plastic, in contrast to the signature aluminum of Maglites.</TE>
<TE>   Maglica, however, saw the brothers' product as a direct attack on
the Maglite. In January, he filed suit in federal court in Los
Angeles, accusing them of trying to steal employees from his company
and pilfering trade secrets they learned while working for him.</TE>
<TE>   Maglica contended that the brothers' claim to have developed a
superior flashlight cost him business. He challenged--as false
advertising--their assertion that the Bison Sportslight emitted a
beam with no black hole.</TE>
<TE>   "I've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to get rid of
the black spot, the black hole," he said. "Physically, it's
impossible to get rid of it. You can get some improvement, but you
can't change the laws of physics."</TE>
<TE>   Maglica and his attorney say the brothers' business venture was
based on vindictiveness and was intended to harm the man who helped
raise them.</TE>
<TE>   "In some sort of perverse way, they were hoping they could go out
and hurt Mr. Maglica in the flashlight business," said Maglica's
lawyer, Robert C. Weiss.</TE>
<TE>   The dramatic moment in court occurred this spring when Weiss
demonstrated the Bison Sportslight to the jury. He clicked on the
light and adjusted the lens setting. The jurors apparently saw a
black hole, because they later found that the brothers' claim to have
overcome the optical effect was false.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors awarded Maglica $1.2 million to compensate him for lost
business and to punish the Halasz brothers for stealing research
information on bulbs, switches and electrical circuits from Mag
Instrument.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers insist that the courtroom demonstration was unfair
because Maglica's attorney placed the flashlight on an extreme
setting that no user would select. Their attorney tried
unsuccessfully to make that point in court. The brothers are
appealing the verdict but worry that their business won't survive.</TE>
<TE>   Bison has a dozen employees and had sales of $200,000 last year,
they say. It has yet to make a profit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Halasz said he thought that given Maglica's success, he
would not care about an upstart company going after a small piece of
the market. He now realizes, he said, that he didn't take into
account the personal dynamic.</TE>
<TE>   "I could see if I snuck up to his house and punctured the tires on
his car why he'd think it was a grudge match," Halasz said. "I don't
see how this can be about anything other than my mother."</TE>
<TE>   Despite their court battle, Maglica and Stephen Halasz have tried
to stay on civil terms, speaking by phone several times about
resolving the case. They both hope they can put it all behind them
someday.</TE>
<TE>   "I know this is going to hurt for a while, but I'll get over it,"
Maglica said. "I don't carry a grudge."</TE>
<TE>   Sitting opposite Maglica during the trial, Halasz said he often
felt an urge to reconcile with the man he once considered a
stepfather.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to get up and say something, but sometimes I just sat
there gasping like a fish," he said. "I'd love to repair this
relationship to one degree or another. I don't know how that's going
to happen."</TE>

<HD>Valley Secessionists Weary of L.A.'s Snubs and Snobs</HD>
<DH>Breakup: Residents say they are denied services and looked
down upon by folks 'over the hill.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NITA LELYVELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Melissa Bidermann's grandfather was a San Fernando Valley citrus
grower with a farmhouse surrounded by dense orange groves near
Devonshire Street and Reseda Boulevard. Not long ago, in the hills
just northwest of the old farm, she said, a Basque shepherd still
tended his flock.</LD>
<LD>   Now the family farm has been swallowed up by strip malls, the
shepherd's pasturelands plowed under for a subdivision. Bidermann and
her husband, Steve, see the Valley's last open spaces fast being
buried under concrete. They blame Los Angeles, that alien place "over
the hill" where they believe developers hold sway and the Valley's
hopes and desires are out of sight, out of mind.</LD>
<LD>   The Bidermanns are convinced that the Valley must secede on Nov. 5
to preserve any trace of its past. But they are not activists. They
are not participating in the ballot campaign; they haven't
volunteered, attended rallies or donated money.</LD>
<TE>   For the Granada Hills couple and many other everyday citizens who
want to break away, secession would satisfy two sentiments: pent-up
anger toward the rest of Los Angeles and nostalgia for a Valley that
they say has disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of recent interviews, the Bidermanns and others in the
Valley said over and over that they feel like second-class citizens,
ignored by city officials who have subordinated Valley needs while
giving prize projects to downtown Los Angeles. In contrast to what
they see as the arrogance of City Hall, those residents expressed
deep affection for the Valley, which they see as a separate place,
special to those who live there and celebrate it.</TE>
<TE>   "The rest of the city--it's just different," said Melissa
Bidermann, 44, an artist. "It's not us. It's more hustle and bustle.
It's more dense and hectic. We're not a part of them. They don't even
want us to be part of them."</TE>
<TE>   Separatists are a minority of voters citywide, a Times poll last
month showed. But in the Valley, more than half favored a split.
Bidermann and many others said a new Valley city would not be a
cure-all, but they were excited at the possibility of having their
problems tackled by people who understand the Valley and appreciate
it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to be Camelot," said Steve Bidermann, 46, who
works as a cost analyst for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena. "It's not going to be nirvana. But I really do think it's
going to be a much nicer place to live." He called Los Angeles "a
4,000-pound giant."</TE>
<TE>   It's a giant that Bob Driscoll felt crushing his toes when a
neighbor called a downtown city office about the Driscolls' barking
dog. Out of the blue, he received a letter from the city, ordering
him downtown for mediation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I drove down there," said the 66-year-old Woodland Hills
businessman. "Oh gosh--it takes at least an hour from here, except
maybe at 6 in the morning. Why couldn't something like that have been
in Van Nuys? Los Angeles is too big, and bigger is never better."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Downtown Too Distant</TE>
<TE>   Driscoll and his wife Marge said they feel cut off from decision
making because it's not easy for them to attend a City Council
meeting or to show up at a zoning board hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "We should have votes that count," said Marge Driscoll, 63,
director of member services for the American Camping Assn. "We should
be heard. I want that chance."</TE>
<TE>   Marge Driscoll said she loves downtown, even though she seldom
goes there because of traffic. But she can't help but feel bitter
that so many of the city's best attractions are in that single area.</TE>
<TE>   "All the theaters, the big projects, they've all been downtown,"
she said. "There's nothing out here in the Valley, and that's just
not fair."</TE>
<TE>   She said it's annoying to hear people joke about how the Valley
has no culture, when that same condescending attitude in downtown
offices is responsible for the dearth of Valley cultural centers.</TE>
<TE>   For Michael Corgnati, who owns a home in Sherman Oaks, the
argument for secession starts and ends with what he sees as this
citywide lack of respect. The 55-year-old, who runs a small
television production company, grew up in an Illinois town of 10,000.
He had never heard of the Valley when he moved to Los Angeles in the
1960s. But he soon got the message, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I just heard that the Valley's about 10 degrees hotter than the
rest of the city," he said, laughing, as he sat in a neighbor's
air-conditioned living room in Sherman Oaks. "And everybody said,
'Don't live in the Valley. Whatever you do, don't live in the
Valley.' "</TE>
<TE>   His decision to move from Hollywood to the Valley embarrassed him
a little. It was purely a pocketbook issue, he said. In the Valley,
he could afford to buy a decent house.</TE>
<TE>   But his impression of the place changed when he got to know most
of his neighbors. He fit right in. He said that he can understand the
Valley's people, that the place reminds him of his hometown.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Valley stigma haunts him. You can hear a hint of
apology in the way he says, "I actually like the place."</TE>
<TE>   His neighbors also feel the stigma, he said, adding that people in
the Valley believe they are slighted by downtown.</TE>
<TE>   His street is a much-used shortcut to the freeway, but neighbors
had to scream for years to get speed bumps and then stop signs, he
said. Now they can rarely get police to ticket the speeders who
routinely run the stop signs.</TE>
<TE>   The police "say to me, 'The powers that be tell us where we have
to be.' And I guess it's not the Valley," he said. "The Westside,
that's where the people of influence live. The Valley, it's more
lunch-pail people."</TE>
<TE>   Like Corgnati, Tom and Forbes Riley headed to the Valley for a
home. They could get so much more house for their money there than in
more fashionable areas, they said. On a quiet street in Van Nuys,
they found a house with a pool and built-in barbecues out back,
bulging orange and grapefruit trees and room enough to start a
family. They're in the middle of a major house renovation. They love
the street, where neighbors frequently gather for parties.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No Help From City Hall</TE>
<TE>   But living there isn't easy, they said. On nearby Sepulveda
Boulevard, prostitutes line the curb at night. There aren't enough
police officers to control the problem. And the whole neighborhood
often has to get together to protect the area, as neighbors did when
they blocked construction of a 7-Eleven they thought would bring more
nighttime trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every interaction with city departments is difficult, said
Tom Riley, 37, whose company sells bingo machines. Often, he has felt
that no one cared enough to take five minutes to help him get the
information he wanted.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to get a dog license for my dog, one of those chips that
you implant," he said. "But I kept calling city offices and I
couldn't find anybody to help me. They would send me to some guy's
voicemail, and I kept leaving messages. And nobody ever called back."</TE>
<TE>   Forbes Riley is pregnant with twins, and the Rileys worry about
the poorly performing neighborhood schools. They believe a separate
Valley city, which would be the sixth-largest city in the nation,
could persuade the state to let it have its own school system. And
they are furious that city officials are telling people that won't
happen.</TE>
<TE>   They see that sort of talk as typical city condescension.</TE>
<TE>   "These people are no dummies," said Tom Riley. "They know that a
Valley city would be in a much better position to get out of the
school district. But they are thinking about what's best for their
pockets, not for us. Sometimes people just need to have their real
concerns acknowledged, to feel that they're heard."</TE>
<TE>   "It's as if Los Angeles is only the city, downtown, and the Valley
is the stepchild," Forbes Riley said.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders often focus their attacks on city services,
saying that the Valley doesn't get its share of attention. On a
recent afternoon, Salvador Torres drove his car down a street near
his house in North Hollywood, to explain why he thinks the argument
makes sense.</TE>
<TE>   Torres, 45, originally from Jalisco, Mexico, moved to Los Angeles
as a young man speaking very little English. He now sells flooring at
Linoleum City in Hollywood and owns a beige stucco bungalow in North
Hollywood. His wife Aida, born in El Salvador, shuttles around
workers in a local housecleaning business. They have two children,
Salvadore, 12, and Sofia, 7, both in Los Angeles public schools.</TE>
<TE>   Torres, who described himself as a fiscally conservative Democrat,
said he has worked very hard to get where he is--but he doesn't see
much return from the city for the taxes he pays. He said it is a
little insulting to watch the city give money to anyone who claims a
need, even those who make no effort to help themselves.</TE>
<TE>   He's all in favor of a new, more conservative Valley city, even
though that might surprise people because of his background, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a more conservative city attracts investment," he said.
"Home prices will go higher. There'll be more revenue, more services.
The only thing I'm worried about is more conservative police. Maybe
they'll see me, a Mexican with a head shaved, and pick me up," he
said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, he's noticed city crews working in his neighborhood. A
sidewalk a block away is being repaved, even though the old sidewalk
was fine, Torres said. For months, he's been hounding the city,
complaining about the cars that drag race all night long each weekend
on nearby Saticoy Street. The other day, he walked into the North
Hollywood police station on his day off, trying once more to get
help.</TE>
<TE>   That afternoon, while cataloging his unsuccessful attempts to get
the city involved, he got a call from the city attorney's office,
eager to help.</TE>
<TE>   Torres said it bothers him that the city thinks him so naive that
he wouldn't connect the sudden interest in fixing Valley problems
with the upcoming secession vote.</TE>
<TE>   "I formed my opinions a long time ago," he said. "The whole Valley
has been feeling disenfranchised and neglected. This is a good time
for people to ask for things to be done, but it won't last. Too
little, too late."</TE>

<HD>From Atomic Dump to Tourist Draw</HD>
<DH>Environment: Public can visit cleaned-up Missouri site.
Although spot has its critics, U.S. plans similar facilities.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WELDON SPRING, Mo.</DL>
<LD>They had a little time after picking peaches and before swimming, so
Marie and Tom Burrows decided to take their grandson Zack to
America's newest tourist attraction: An enormous pile of radioactive
waste.</LD>
<LD>   His flip-flops flapping as he ran, 9-year-old Zack Aiello
scrambled up the mini-mountain of boulders that entombs waste from
decades of bomb making: TNT, asbestos, arsenic, lead and, above all,
uranium, purified here in this St. Louis suburb to power the Atomic
Age. From the top of the mound, seven stories up, Zack scanned the
sprawl of the dump. "Cool," he judged.</LD>
<LD>   "Am I glowing?" his grandma teased, laughing.</LD>
<TE>   A butterfly darted by. Zack gave chase over the waste pile. The
Burrows lingered at the top, admiring the view.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have to have this here," Tom Burrows said, "you might as
well enjoy it."</TE>
<TE>   Talk about a tourist hot spot. After a cleanup that has lasted 16
years and cost nearly $1 billion, the U.S. Department of Energy
opened Weldon Spring to the public last week. Visitors can hike up
the nuclear dump or check out the Geiger counters in a new museum,
set up in a building that was once used to check uranium workers for
contamination.</TE>
<TE>   A six-mile bike trail on the property will open soon, winding past
the massive waste "containment cell" and along an old limestone
quarry that just a decade ago was packed with radioactive rubble, TNT
residue and crumpled metal drums oozing chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Hopes to Encourage Tourism at Waste Sites</TE>
<TE>   Weldon Spring is the first of more than 120 industrial sites in
the U.S. nuclear weapon complex to near complete cleanup. Even after
billions of dollars of high-tech scrubbing, many of them, like Weldon
Spring, will retain a radioactive repository. But federal officials
maintain that when the waste is entombed between thick layers of clay
and rock, it's safe for the public to visit.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, if the experiment here works, they hope to encourage
tourism at such sites around the nation.</TE>
<TE>   At a time of fierce debate about the proposed nuclear repository
at Nevada's Yucca Mountain, proponents say that giving public tours
of containment cells may offer reassurance that radioactivity can be
controlled.</TE>
<TE>   In an age when the governor of South Carolina threatens to lie
down in the road to block plutonium shipments, bringing Boy Scout
troops to explore a nuclear dump may send a comforting signal that
the waste can be managed.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians in a dozen states have protested transportation routes
that would ship nuclear material through their turf. But at Weldon
Spring, families will soon be able to hike through a complex where
clumps of yellow uranium ore were scattered casually about as
recently as the mid-1980s. Kids from the high school half a mile down
the street can picnic atop 1.5 million cubic yards of nuclear waste.</TE>
<TE>   "If you put up a fence, all that communicates is fear," said Pam
Thompson, the Weldon Spring project manager. "The only way to defeat
fear is knowledge."</TE>
<TE>   To some critics, that smacks of propaganda.</TE>
<TE>   The Weldon Spring museum lays out every detail of the cleanup
process, down to a photo of a worker mowing the lawn in full
protective gear and respirator. Visitors can feel the impermeable
synthetic liners used in the containment cell, which covers 45 acres.
They can study models showing how the waste is trapped in the center
of the dump, surrounded by clay and stone barriers up to 40 feet
thick.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there's little information about why such elaborate
precautions are necessary--little about the danger of radiation, the
cancers many uranium workers suffered, the environmental damage
caused by federal employees chucking radioactive waste in open-air
lagoons through much of the 1950s and '60s.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing glamorous about the history of Weldon Spring,"
said Dr. Daniel McKeen, a local pathologist who has long raised
health concerns about the site. An exhibit focused on the heroics of
the cleanup effort "really offends me," McKeen added.</TE>
<TE>   State officials bristle as well, complaining that the museum may
make people think that every scrap of waste from decades of weapon
production has been locked inside the cell. In truth, uranium
persists, at low levels, along a spring in a nearby wildlife refuge.
TNT from a World War I ordnance factory at Weldon Spring has been
found in drinking water two miles away. Groundwater near the uranium
plant is contaminated with a dangerous chemical called
trichloroethylene. And soil and water on the site and off will need
to be monitored for tens of thousands of years to make sure the
containment cell does not leak.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole ribbon-cutting ceremony totally distracts from the
remaining work that needs to be done," said Ron Kucera, deputy
director of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.</TE>
<TE>   Added Kay Drey, a local environmental activist: "This is an
unbelievable creation. The place should be a tourist repellent. Yet
they may be able to talk people into thinking that all things
radioactive are good."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An Emphasis on Perils of Radioactive Waste</TE>
<TE>   Thompson insists that's not her goal. In fact, she says, opening
Weldon Spring to tourism is an effort to emphasize, not minimize, the
perils of radioactive waste. By integrating the dump into the
fast-growing suburban community that surrounds it, Thompson hopes to
keep the public aware of what's buried under the huge mound of
rocks--and why they must keep a close eye on it. By inviting school
tours and family visits, she hopes to ensure that each new generation
will respect the deadly power of the waste in their backyard.</TE>
<TE>   "If we want people to be protected and to keep the area protected,
we need to get them involved," she said. "You don't do that by
keeping everything locked behind closed doors."</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the Department of Energy's first instinct might have
been to surround the site with barbed wire. But in recent years,
officials have begun to worry that locking the danger out of sight
might push it out of the public's mind as well. They point to
tragedies like Love Canal, where homes in a neighborhood of Niagara
Falls, N.Y., were built atop a buried chemical waste dump.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the great fears all of us have is that people will
forget," said Kai Lee, who chairs a panel on managing radioactive
sites for the National Academy of Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to expect that the controls you put in place [to keep
the waste safe] will fail," added John Applegate, a member of the
panel. "You have to be sure that in the future, people know exactly
what's there and what you did to it."</TE>
<TE>   Written records, of course, are one way of preserving the
information. The Internet is another. But some experts say an oral
tradition--facts passed from one generation to the next--is vital,
because files tend to get lost or forgotten and Web pages may be
inaccessibly obsolete by the time they're needed.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot tell you how many times I've gone to look at documents
about a toxic site and it's, 'Golly, Gladys lost her key to that file
cabinet,' or 'Wasn't that the one that washed away in the flood?' "
said Jim Werner, who directed research into long-term stewardship of
radioactive sites for the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Open-Door Policy at Site a New Approach</TE>
<TE>   The open-door policy at Weldon Spring represents a novel approach
to keeping the story alive. "I don't know if it's the right answer. I
don't think anyone knows," Werner said. "This is definitely unplowed
territory."</TE>
<TE>   For the next few months, while the bike path is being built,
visitors to Weldon Spring must make appointments so they can be
escorted up the cell, wearing orange vests and safety goggles. Once
the heavy equipment is gone, however, those restrictions will be
lifted. The fence and the parking lot guard station have already been
torn down. There are no plans to post security on site; officials say
the cell can withstand even a terrorist truck bomb without releasing
radiation.</TE>
<TE>   Such assurances don't calm everyone. One tourist at the site last
week, a young mother who had just moved nearby, noted in the
visitor's log that she was "curious and afraid" about the looming
waste heap. Another local said with an uneasy chuckle that he doesn't
plan a visit any time soon. "I'd give it a few years," he said.
"There's a lot of nasty stuff out there."</TE>
<TE>   Still, many here in St. Charles County, which hugs the Missouri
River north of St. Louis, view the new tourist attraction with more
excitement than trepidation. The opening ceremony last week drew 200,
despite oppressive heat. Since then, scores of visitors have
overwhelmed the staff. "It's become quite a madhouse," said Wendy
Drnec, community relations manager.</TE>
<TE>   William Selinger, a 58-year-old manufacturing engineer, took his
wife, Marilyn, to the top of the cell and pronounced it "very nice,"
although he did worry that the long, sloping sides might entice
snowboarders come winter.</TE>
<TE>   As for Zack, he allowed that he would have preferred a morning at
Six Flags St. Louis amusement park, screaming his way through the
roller coasters. But the waste dump, he decided, wasn't a bad way to
pass an hour. His grandparents, meanwhile, were fascinated.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you say 'nuclear,' it makes some people uptight," Tom
Burrows said. "But I think it's pretty neat."</TE>

<HD>Two Bills Support Decisions to End Pregnancy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Legislature on Monday passed bills aimed at providing emergency
contraception services for sexual assault victims and shoring up
abortion training at medical schools.</LD>
<LD>   Both bills are expected to reach Gov. Gray Davis' desk within two
weeks. Davis is expected to sign both into law.</LD>
<LD>   The Assembly passed, 46 to 4, a measure that would require
health-care workers to provide "morning after" contraception pills to
sexual assault victims upon request.</LD>
<TE>   The bill, which received no significant opposition, would expand
post-assault procedures, which now focus on gathering evidence and
the treatment of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say victims would be given the right to prevent the
further tragedy of unwanted pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   "This makes a contraceptive available to women who have been
victimized, and we want to prevent pregnancy and be realistic about
the problem," said Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco).</TE>
<TE>   In another measure, the Senate approved legislation that
supporters say would increase the dwindling number of abortion
doctors by requiring medical schools to provide training.</TE>
<TE>   Though the state's medical schools must offer education in how to
terminate pregnancies to be accredited, backers fear that some
institutions de-emphasize the classes by offering them as electives
or offering them off-campus.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation, which passed 25 to 13, does not include any
enforcement measures beyond what is required by the Accreditation
Council for Graduate Medical Education. But supporters have said the
law would force the private, standard-setting council to demand
stricter compliance with its rules.</TE>
<TE>   "This sends a loud and clear message to California schools: You've
got to make it accessible for residents who want to take this
training," said Joan Hall, a legislative advocate for the American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.</TE>
<TE>   Under the bill, students objecting to abortion on religious or
moral grounds would not be required to take the training.</TE>
<TE>   Some antiabortion groups opposed the training measure.</TE>
<TE>   In a written statement, the Committee on Moral Concerns argued
that the bill required "every new gynecologist in California, except
the few who have a solid religious or moral commitment, to learn to

<HD>Festival of Arts Deal Is 'Close'</HD>
<DH>Culture: A new 40-year lease could be announced tonight
after Laguna Beach City Council and event officials finalize terms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After nearly six years of negotiations, Laguna Beach officials and
directors of the Festival of Arts are poised to announce a new lease
agreement today that would keep the signature event in the city for
at least the next 40 years and include a $7-million face-lift for the
compound.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council plans a closed session before its regular meeting
tonight to clarify the terms of an outstanding accounting issue that,
according to both sides, is minor. After the closed session, festival
directors and council members plan to announce the deal.</LD>
<LD>   "It's very, very close," said Robert Dietrich, a treasurer for the
festival's board of directors who has been part of the negotiations
for the past year.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a very good deal for the city and the festival and the
citizens of Laguna Beach, and hopefully, our patrons throughout
Southern California," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach has hosted the eight-week exhibition of more than 150
regional artists since 1932.</TE>
<TE>   The city began negotiating a new lease in 1996 with a previous set
of festival directors who were recalled two years ago after they
threatened to move the event to San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   The new board ran into its own share of frustrations with the
city, but the two sides have met on a regular basis since last year
and have shown a commitment to resolving their differences.</TE>
<TE>   Talks intensified in the past few weeks, as Councilmen Steve
Dicterow and Paul Freeman took over negotiations for the city.
Neither could be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it brought in a fresh look at one of the issues,"
Dietrich said, alluding to the accounting issue "that they found a
pretty simple solution for."</TE>
<TE>   Once the agreement is signed, the festival plans to break ground
by September on the first phase of a capital improvement project,
pending approval by the Planning Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Initial projects will cost about $1.8 million and include upgrades
to the administration building and the storm-drain system, with most
of the money going toward renovation of the 60-year-old workshops and
classrooms used for the Pageant of the Masters show that runs in
tandem with the festival.</TE>
<TE>   Another $5 million has been earmarked for a new facade at the
entrance and a new exhibit area, as well as an assortment of
refurbishment projects at the Irvine Bowl amphitheater, including an
improved sound system, expanded seating and upgrades to the orchestra
pit and backstage.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we get the lease done it's really time to get down to work,"
Dietrich said. "You take a deep breath and get ready for the real
work to begin."</TE>

<HD>Firefighters Gaining on Area Wildfires</HD>
<DH>Blazes: Battles against flames in Los Angeles, San
Bernardino and Riverside counties meeting with success.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Firefighters appeared to be gaining the upper hand Monday against
wildfires in western Riverside, San Bernardino and Los Angeles
counties.</LD>
<LD>   In Sierra Madre, a fire broke out at 1:56 p.m. Monday afternoon
and backed "right up to homes" in some areas, said Inspector Roland
Sprewell of the L.A. County Fire Department.</LD>
<LD>   A stolen car that apparently had been set on fire intentionally
ignited the blaze just north of Arno Drive and Santa Anita Avenue,
said Gail Wright, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service.
Helicopters dumped several hundred gallons of water on the fire
throughout the day, and no homes were damaged.</LD>
<TE>   The fire consumed 40 acres, Wright said. It was fully contained
Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   In San Bernardino County, officials said a fire that had blackened
more than 500 acres between Calimesa and Yucaipa was about 50%
contained.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze started about 1:45 p.m. Sunday on the outskirts of
Yucaipa and advanced rapidly south across the Riverside County line,
briefly threatening some homes in Cherry Valley and prompting the
voluntary evacuation of about 150 residents.</TE>
<TE>   About 650 firefighters and seven water-dropping planes checked the
spread of the flames Monday morning. No homes were lost, but one
garage was damaged.</TE>
<TE>   Three California Department of Forestry firefighters from Tuolumne
County were injured Sunday when their truck skidded off Interstate 15
in San Bernardino while responding to the fire.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Forestry said a second blaze in the foothills of
Banning was about 90% contained Monday night after scorching about
250 acres of brush in Mias Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 firefighters were deployed in the rugged hills near the
Morongo Indian Reservation to make sure evening breezes through the
Banning Pass did not cause any flare-ups.</TE>
<TE>   The 62,000-acre fire that started two weeks ago near Julian in San
Diego County was 95% contained, with full containment predicted by
this morning.</TE>

<HD>Panel OKs Energy Bond Hike to Ease Fears on Wall St.</HD>
<DH>Finance: The extra $850 million will raise the total to
$11.95 billion but will save money over the long run by gaining the
state a higher rating, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>To ease Wall Street's fears that electricity prices will again go
haywire, California officials have boosted the size of the energy
crisis bond--already the biggest borrowing by a government agency in
U.S. history--from $11.1 billion to $11.95 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The additional money is to be used as a cash buffer in case power
prices skyrocket.</LD>
<LD>   With no debate, the California Public Utilities Commission voted 5
to 0 Monday to amend the documents that spell out the basic elements
of the bond sale, which is expected to take place this fall.</LD>
<TE>   The $850-million adjustment is intended to address the concerns of
three Wall Street rating agencies. Those agencies assess the risk to
lenders, and their judgments, expected within weeks, will greatly
influence how much California pays to borrow money.</TE>
<TE>   "The stronger the level of reserves, the stronger the rating,"
said Dan Aschenbach, senior vice president for Moody's Investors
Service.</TE>
<TE>   The $11.1-billion bond deal already included reserves of at least
$2.2 billion. But more is better, rating agency analysts say, given
the uncertainty of future power prices and the complicated
relationship between the state agency that buys power and the Public
Utilities Commission, which controls the utility rates that
ultimately pay for that power.</TE>
<TE>   Though wholesale electricity prices have been relatively low and
stable for more than a year, tight supplies threatened the state
during a heat wave last month and private power plant construction
has stalled.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly the more reserves you've got, the more protection you've
got," said Claire Cohen, vice chairwoman at Fitch, one of three key
Wall Street rating agencies.</TE>
<TE>   State officials working to prepare the bond sale said that deeper
reserves would save California money over the long run. Experts
estimate that the difference between a "B" rating and the "A" sought
by California can total $1 billion in interest paid over the 20-year
life of the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to figure that you take out more debt and it saves you
money, but in this case it does," said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for
the Department of Water Resources.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Water Resources has been buying electricity for
the customers of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, Southern California Edison
and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric since the height of the electricity
crisis in January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the $850 million in additional
reserves will be needed only so long as the Department of Water
Resources buys power for the utilities. By law, the agency's role
will end Jan. 1, but it may be extended if the utilities are not
creditworthy by then. Once the utilities resume their full duties,
the $850 million could be used to cut electricity rates or to help
pay off the energy bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "The money is not lost," Angelides said.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph S. Fichera, chief executive officer of Saber Partners, an
investment banking firm that advised Gov. Gray Davis during the
electricity crisis, said bolstering reserves through borrowing is
like "using a credit card rather than a checking account."</TE>
<TE>   "If everything goes right, you will get it back," Fichera said,
"but the nearly billion dollars is still costing you in interest.
It's still almost a billion dollars at risk, sitting around unused."</TE>
<TE>   The bonds will be paid off through the monthly utility bills of 27
million people served by the three utilities. The bonds are designed
to replace the $6.5 billion the state spent in the winter and spring
of 2001 and $4.3 billion borrowed in June 2001 to buy electricity.</TE>

<LD>Avoiding the possibility of a death penalty, a Long Beach man pleaded
guilty Monday to first-degree murder in the drowning deaths of his
two young children in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Henry James White, 28, faces a sentence of life without parole,
the district attorney's office announced Monday.</LD>
<LD>   White entered the plea as jury selection for his trial was about
to begin. Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary T. Suzukawa had been seeking the
death penalty.</LD>
<TE>   White, who was estranged from his wife, was accused of drowning
Christopher James, 5, and Brianna Monea, 15 months, in his bathtub.
The children's bodies were left in a dumpster at White's apartment
complex, authorities said.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich dedicated 500 acres of

will provide continuous wilderness trails in the Rim of the Valley
corridor of the Santa Clarita Woodlands Park.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a marvelous destination for people that want to hike, ride a
bike or ride a horse in one of the truly botanical areas in
California," said Rorie Skei, chief deputy executive officer for the
Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, the agency that owns
and manages the Santa Clarita Woodlands Park.</LD>
<LD>   Located on the northern border of Los Angeles, northwest of
O'Melveny Park, the acquired property offers sweeping views of the
Santa Clarita and San Fernando valleys as well a diversity of flora
and fauna--everything from big cone Douglas fir, California walnut
and oak trees to black bears, deer and mountain lions.</LD>
<TE>   "When you're up there, you don't even realize there's a city,"
Santa Clarita City Councilwoman Laurene Weste said.</TE>
<TE>   Antonovich first introduced a motion to acquire the property, and
an adjacent 520-acre parcel in Bee Canyon, in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   The county then required the property's owner, Browning-Ferris
Industries, to hand the deed over to the Mountains Recreation and
Conservation Authority. In exchange, the county granted BFI a permit
to expand the Sunshine Canyon Landfill, which it operates.</TE>
<TE>   Transfer of the parkland was stalled by environmental reviews,
litigation and the cleanup of oil wells on the site, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's taken about a decade," Skei said. "But here we go."</TE>
<TE>   With this acquisition, the Santa Clarita Woodlands Park will
expand to 4,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   The land is named the Michael D. Antonovich Open Space Preserve.
Antonovich has "been there since the beginning and saw it through,"
said Jim Park, an assistant director in the county Parks and
Recreation Department.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been working to extend the trail system throughout the
county of Los Angeles, and this is another step forward," Antonovich
said.</TE>

<HD>Nancy Chaffee, 73; Ranked 4th in Women's Tennis in '51</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nancy Chaffee, who was once ranked as high as No. 4 in the world in
tennis, died in Coronado on Sunday of complications from cancer. She
was 73.</LD>
<LD>   She was diagnosed with the disease on Valentine's Day, according
to her husband of 11 years, veteran network sportscaster Jack
Whitaker.</LD>
<LD>   Chaffee, who was raised in Ventura, played tennis during the era
of Maureen Connolly, Doris Hart and Shirley Fry. She reached the
semifinals of what is now called the U.S. Open in 1950 as an unseeded
player. A year later, at that event, Chaffee and her partner,
Patricia Todd, lost in the doubles final to Fry and Hart.</LD>
<TE>   From 1950 to 1952, Chaffee won the U.S. women's national indoors
singles titles, which included a victory over legend Althea Gibson in
the 1950 final.</TE>
<TE>   Her highest world ranking came in 1951 just after Connolly, Hart
and Fry.</TE>
<TE>   Although Chaffee won the national girls' 18-and-under title in
1947, she didn't compete at Wimbledon until 1950.</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles sportswriter helped her raise the necessary funds by
writing a column, suggesting a "Chaffee to Wimbledon fund."</TE>
<TE>   In 1951, Chaffee married baseball star Ralph Kiner. She is
survived by their children, Michael, Scott and Kathryn, who is
married to golf pro Robin Freeman; three granddaughters; and two
grandsons.</TE>
<TE>   In later years, Chaffee was active in fund-raising. In 1992, she
helped start an amateur mixed doubles tournament in East Hampton,
N.Y., raising funds for the American Cancer Society.</TE>
<TE>   A funeral service will be held Friday in Palm Desert, Whitaker
said.</TE>

<HD>Chapman's Law School Is Given Full Accreditation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The American Bar Assn. gave full accreditation Monday to Chapman
University's School of Law after seven years of struggle, a lost
lawsuit and the resignation of its founding dean.</LD>
<LD>   Although Chapman received provisional accreditation in 1998, the
new designation is expected to help the law school recruit students
and faculty.</LD>
<LD>   Accreditation means the university in Orange is one of 182 U.S.
law schools to pass the ABA's academic standards. With national bar
accreditation, graduates can take a bar exam anywhere in the country.</LD>
<TE>   The law school, which held its first classes in 1995, was twice
turned down for accreditation because it lacked a permanent building
and over concerns about lax grading and the academic quality of the
faculty. Dean Jeremy Miller resigned. Nearly 50 students took an
offer of a tuition refund, costing Chapman $1.25 million.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven students sued the university. Last year, an Orange County
jury found that Chapman intentionally deceived them about the quality
of the law school and the impact its lack of accreditation would have
on them. But jurors did not award financial damages. Before the jury
announced its verdict, the judge ordered Chapman to repay the
students a year's tuition.</TE>
<TE>   When classes resume Monday, Chapman's law school will have about
370 students.</TE>

<HD>School to Write Book on Learning</HD>
<DH>Education: A fledgling charter campus in Camarillo will try
new ways of teaching grade-schoolers, in close association with
CSUCI.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIN GRENNAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Teachers seeking jobs, and parents wanting to enroll their children,
faced stiff competition getting into a new charter school closely
linked with Cal State Channel Islands.</LD>
<LD>   "We knew that the school would be of great interest to people, but
we were pretty overwhelmed," said Linda Ngarupe, principal of
University Preparation School in Camarillo.</LD>
<LD>   The kindergarten-through-fifth-grade school, on the former El
Rancho Structured School campus, will open Sept. 3 with 350 students
from Camarillo, Oxnard, Port Hueneme, Moorpark and Conejo Valley.</LD>
<TE>   An additional 180 students are on the waiting list, Ngarupe said.
That doesn't include children who are a year or more away from
starting kindergarten whose parents have tried to sign them up.</TE>
<TE>   The 19 teachers were chosen from 69 applicants from throughout
Ventura County. All are tenured teachers with special skills in such
areas as writing or technology, said Ngarupe, herself chosen from a
field of 14 candidates. Most have master's degrees and half are
bilingual.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just so exciting, what with the all-star team and just
starting from scratch, building a nice new program," teacher Andy
Hoerer said. "It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Aspiring administrators and teachers enrolled at Cal State Channel
Islands will intern at the school, where they will get hands-on
experience under the guidance of the veteran educators, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   University Preparation School will be the third charter school in
the county and the first that isn't for home-schooled students,
according to school officials. Golden Valley Charter School started
in El Rio a year ago, and Valley Oak Charter School will open in Ojai
in September.</TE>
<TE>   As a charter school, University Preparation will be funded by the
state on a per-student basis. The school doesn't have to comply with
the state's rigid education code, but teachers will be responsible
for annual standardized testing, Ngarupe said.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers and the CSUCI professors they are working with will be
free to try new ways of teaching to improve performance, officials
said. They will be allowed to use books and programs they think will
work best.</TE>
<TE>   Classes will not be broken up into single grade levels as in
traditional schools. Kindergarten and first-grade students will be
combined in early-years classes, second-and third-grade students will
be in primary-years classes, and fourth-and fifth-grade students will
be in intermediate-years classes. In the future, Ngarupe hopes to
expand to include preschoolers and sixth-through eighth-graders.</TE>
<TE>   Each student's academic, developmental and social needs will be
assessed regularly so they can work with other children at their
level in each subject, said Ngarupe, formerly the principal at El
Rancho.</TE>
<TE>   Intermediate-years teacher Jeanette Smith said the multi-age
classes will allow her to tailor instruction more closely to each
child's needs.</TE>
<TE>   If a fourth-grader is strong in math, she can put him in a cluster
with students working on fifth-grade curriculum. If a fifth-grader is
weak in reading, he can work with the fourth-grade curriculum. For
fifth-graders working above grade level, Smith will find special
projects to challenge them.</TE>
<TE>   Smith is particularly pleased that students will be in the same
class for two years. A year from now, she said, she will be more
familiar with her students' math and reading levels. In turn,
students will know Smith's system and be able to help bring their
younger classmates up to speed.</TE>
<TE>   "That is really an avenue to gain a lot of time," said Smith, a
Somis resident who taught at El Rancho last year.</TE>
<TE>   The multi-age classes and the strong technology program excite
Tammie Kadin, a Camarillo mother who has a 9-year-old enrolled and a
7-year-old who has been on the waiting list since March.</TE>
<TE>   The school's dual-language program is what first attracted Kadin,
because she thinks it is important for her children to learn Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   All students will spend 30 to 60 minutes each day learning to
speak Spanish. This will not only expose English-speaking students to
another language but also give the Spanish-speaking students a chance
to be leaders and mentors, Ngarupe said. Spanish-speaking students,
who will make up 35% of the school's population, will have a separate
block of time for learning English.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, some of the early-years students will be taught to
read, write and speak in English and Spanish, with half of the day's
instruction led in each language.</TE>
<TE>   The hope is that creative teaching programs that work well at
University Preparation School could eventually be used in classrooms
elsewhere, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be a beacon ... that guides the way for other schools,"
said CSUCI education professor Merilyn Buchanan.</TE>

<HD>Boy's Death Was Preventable, Jury Told</HD>
<DH>Court: Lawyer says teacher should have tried to stop the
fight, but Palmdale school official denies negligence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The death of a 13-year-old student, killed during a fistfight on a
Palmdale school campus in 1999, could have been prevented with better
adult supervision, an attorney for the boy's mother argued in court
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Melanie E. Lomax urged jurors in her closing argument to
find that the Palmdale School District had been negligent in the
wrongful death of Stephan Corson.</LD>
<LD>   Lomax said a teacher at Juniper Intermediate School had failed to
ensure Corson's safety when she did not accompany students as they
left her classroom. She asked the Van Nuys jury to award her client
$1.5 million in compensatory damages plus $9,000 for the boy's
medical and funeral expenses.</LD>
<TE>   Corson was killed Nov. 19, 1999, after he initiated a fistfight
with another student outside the classroom and was knocked to the
ground. He died of a spinal injury within an hour, Lomax said.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office investigated
and, in 2000, declined to file criminal charges against the other
student.</TE>
<TE>   After her son's death, Mary Corson sued the school district.</TE>
<TE>   Martin L. Carpenter, an attorney for the district, called Corson's
death "tragic and unpredictable" but denied that the school district
had been negligent. Another teacher had intervened to try to stop the
fight but Corson had continued hitting his 14-year-old classmate, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But if the school district is found to have been negligent,
Carpenter urged jurors to consider a lesser monetary award,
suggesting that $600,000 would be "a reasonable amount." He urged
jurors to find that Corson should bear half the responsibility for
his own death.</TE>
<TE>   Lomax conceded that the boy had begun the fight and was partly
responsible, but she said he had less responsibility than the adults
who had a duty to protect him. She asked the jury to find the school
district 80% liable. Lomax described an "out of control" classroom in
which the teacher had allowed her students to become loud and
disruptive. Corson believed that the other boy had thrown paper at
him and began the fight in retaliation, although the boy denied doing
so, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The teacher should have known the boys were planning to fight
after school and tried to stop them, Lomax said.</TE>
<TE>   The teacher also could have responded when the fight began outside
her classroom, she said. A dozen or more students were gathered
around, yelling as they watched the brawl.</TE>
<TE>   "They were all out there, preparing for a blood sport," Lomax
said.</TE>
<TE>   Without her youngest son, Mary Corson has stopped celebrating
Christmas, Lomax said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the light of her life. He was the reason she got up in the
morning and went to bed at night," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The jury is set to continue deliberating today in the courtroom of
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Richard A. Adler.</TE>

<HD>Driver in Fatal Crash Allegedly Ran 3 Lights</HD>
<DH>Roads: Police say they will seek manslaughter and drunk
driving charges in collision near Tustin that killed two. An accident
in Santa Ana also takes two lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The driver of a van that allegedly sped through three red lights near
Tustin before broadsiding a car and killing two people inside was
booked Monday for alleged vehicular manslaughter and felony drunk
driving, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   It was one of two fatal traffic accidents that left four people
dead Sunday night in Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   The driver, who identified himself as Jesus Torres, 19, of Santa
Ana, was treated for minor injuries at Western Medical Center-Santa
Ana before being transferred to Orange County Jail.</LD>
<TE>   California Highway Patrol officials have not confirmed the
driver's identity because he did not provide a driver's license or
other legal identification. The information he gave officers also
conflicted with that given by a woman who identified herself as his
wife, said CHP spokeswoman Colleen Richardson.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said Torres' 1978 Chevrolet van was northbound on
Newport Boulevard and ran two red lights just before the 6:40 p.m.
collision. He allegedly sped through a third red light at Cowan
Heights Drive, in unincorporated Cowan Heights, and slammed into the
driver's side of a 1995 Toyota Corolla, killing those inside.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County coroner's office has not released the names of
the dead because their relatives had not been located.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson said the driver of the Toyota was a 24-year-old woman
from Whittier. The 38-year-old passenger was a mother of three and
lived in Garden Grove, Richardson said.</TE>
<TE>   A passenger in the van, who was not identified, was also treated
for minor injuries at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   An hour after that accident, a couple from Tustin were killed in a
Santa Ana collision. The couple's brown compact Toyota was broadsided
by a sport utility vehicle at Harbor Boulevard and Kent Avenue in
Santa Ana, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The driver of the Toyota, Can Duc Ha, 52, died at the scene. His
wife, Bich Ha, 54, was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where
she died about two hours later, said supervising deputy coroner
Cullen Ellingbergh.</TE>
<TE>   Both suffered severe trauma to the upper body.</TE>
<TE>   The Toyota had pulled onto Harbor from Kent and into the path of
the white Mercedes-Benz SUV. The SUV was northbound on Harbor and
slammed into the driver's side of the Toyota.</TE>
<TE>   A witness reported that the Toyota had stopped just before
entering the intersection, police said.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like the Toyota stopped and didn't see a car and pulled
out in front of the SUV," Santa Ana Police Lt. Bob Chavez said.</TE>
<TE>   The two occupants of the SUV suffered minor injuries. The driver,
Quang Vinh Phi, 22, and passenger Ivan Vinh Phi, 15, both of Fountain
Valley, were treated at a hospital and released.</TE>
<TE>   The driver of the SUV had the right-of-way and was not charged or
cited, Chavez said.</TE>

<HD>Weather, Bands Help County Fair Set Attendance Record</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Officials credit leading musical acts as a big
reason for the 5.5% increase over last year's turnout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County Fair vendors packed up the last corndog stand Monday
afternoon, after a 12-day run that drew a record number of revelers.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 292,400 people came through the gates of Ventura's Seaside
Park, topping last year's attendance record by 5.5%, fair spokeswoman
Terri Raley said.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it fit with people's needs this year," she said. "People
are enjoying a resurgence of personal contact and celebration of
community. I think we're all looking a little closer to home."</LD>
<TE>   Good weather and a long list of performers--from local musicians
to big-name acts--also helped, Raley said.</TE>
<TE>   Grammy winner Los Tigres del Norte on Aug. 4 drew one of this
year's largest single-day crowds, she said, followed by the band
Sugar Ray, which played the following day.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the concerts were very well received," Raley said. "I wish
I knew what the formula was for this year, because I'd replicate it
for next year."</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 fair included a few new midway attractions--the most
popular being a bungee jump, which Raley said will return next year.</TE>
<TE>   There was also a new rule that drew some controversy: Anything
considered gang attire was banned. The policy identified 27 local
groups as criminal street gangs, including the Hells Angels and the
rival Mongols motorcycle clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Nine members of the local Hells Angels chapter--decked out in
black leather vests emblazoned with their winged-skull insignia--were
denied entry to the fair on opening day, but no other challenges to
the policy occurred, Raley said.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura Police Lt. Bryan Roberts said authorities patrolling the
fair reported no violent crimes and no significant arrests. "It was a
very safe year at the fair once again," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sunday was the final day of the fair, Monday was far from
quiet. Vendors and carnival operators spent the morning packing up
rides and booths, and residents who had competed in various exhibits
picked up their entries.</TE>
<TE>   Fair board members also strolled the grounds, taking notes and
already starting the planning for next summer. Raley, however, said
she avoids Seaside Park the day after the fair.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like the party's over," she said. "And when you like
it a lot, it makes you sad."</TE>

<HD>Freeman Confirmed as State Power Chief</HD>
<DH>Energy: The party-line vote by lawmakers is seen as a
victory for Gov. Davis. Republicans opposed the appointment and
creation of the agency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>S. David Freeman, accused by Republicans of having gouged
Californians during the energy crisis and defended by Democrats as a
public servant who tenaciously fought for consumers, was confirmed
Monday as chief of the new state public power authority.</LD>
<LD>   Majority Democrats prevailed over Republicans in a party-line
25-23 vote. The tally ended a bruising two-hour debate in which the
GOP assailed Freeman's performance during the energy crisis last
year, when he was general manager of the Los Angeles Department of
Water and Power.</LD>
<LD>   "Freeman, as head of the Department of Water and Power, gouged
consumers and ripped off taxpayers far more than Enron," charged Sen.
Ross Johnson of Irvine.</LD>
<TE>   He likened Freeman to the former Enron chief, Kenneth Lay, whose
once high-flying company collapsed in bankruptcy, which led to
criminal and other investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Confirmation of Freeman, 76, as chairman of the board of the
California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority handed
Gov. Gray Davis a victory at a time when the governor's handling of
the energy crisis has become a campaign issue for his reelection
opponent, Republican Bill Simon Jr.</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats, some of whom acknowledged that Freeman had made
mistakes in his public power career of four decades, countered that
Republicans were misrepresenting and distorting the record in a
partisan attempt to weaken Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "The history that has been portrayed here is so full of falsity
that I'm shocked," said Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar), a former
member of the Los Angeles City Council who worked with Freeman on Los
Angeles power issues.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon conceded that the Los Angeles power department under
Freeman had engaged in "overbilling," but accused Republicans of
unfairly trying to paint Freeman as the poster image for California's
failed experiment in electricity deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman, a nationally recognized expert on public power, served
Presidents Johnson, Nixon and Carter. He was appointed to head the
state agency one year ago, after a stint as an advisor to Davis and
contract negotiator during the energy crisis. If his confirmation had
failed, Freeman would have been turned out of his $220,000-a-year
post today.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman, seldom seen in public without his well-worn, white cowboy
hat, is a seasoned, wily executive who is known for charming friends
and enemies alike with his disarming Texas-Tennessee accent.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to heading up the Los Angeles agency from 1997-2001,
when it was on the verge of financial collapse, Freeman also has held
top posts at the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Sacramento Municipal
Utility District, the New York Power Authority and the Lower Colorado
River Authority.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Freeman expressed gratitude Monday to the
Democrats who voted for him. He said he looked forward to "keeping
the lights on, electricity costs down ... bringing cleaner energy to
the state."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Simon charged that, under Freeman, the Department
of Water and Power had been "one of the largest profiteers" in the
energy crunch. He said the new state agency should not be led by "one
of the state's biggest price gougers."</TE>
<TE>   As California survived a handful of blackouts last year, Davis and
other Democrats blamed Enron and other out-of-state generators for
charging excessive prices as the state's three major private
utilities were collapsing, and the state stepped in to purchase
energy on their behalf.</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans, who opposed creating the public power authority,
focused on the Department of Water and Power and its sales of surplus
electricity to the state. The agency came under scrutiny from several
investigative agencies, which criticized its practices but stopped
short of charging it with illegal actions.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Leader John L. Burton (D-San Francisco), author of the bill
that created the power authority last year, dismissed Republican
comparisons of Freeman with Enron's Lay as off base. Sen. Joe Dunn
(D-Garden Grove), the Senate's expert on illegal price gouging and
market manipulation, voted for Freeman, saying he believed there was
no evidence that Freeman had committed a "misdeed" that would
disqualify him.</TE>

<HD>Judge Bars Inglewood From Disciplining Officers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge Monday blocked the city of Inglewood from punishing two
police officers for their alleged involvement in the July 6 beating
of 16-year-old Donovan Jackson.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Bob Hight issued a
temporary restraining order prohibiting city officials from taking
actions against Officers Bijan Darvish and Antoine Crook. Last week,
another judge issued a similar order forbidding the city from firing
Officer Jeremy J. Morse, who was caught on videotape slamming Jackson
down on a police car and then punching him in the jaw.</LD>
<LD>   The incident brought international notoriety to the Inglewood
Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   The orders are effective pending hearings to decide whether
preliminary injunctions will be issued against the city. The hearings
have been scheduled Aug. 28 for Morse and Aug. 29 for Darvish and
Crook.</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles grand jury has indicted Morse for assault under
color of authority and Darvish for filing a false police report. The
city has placed Morse on administrative leave, while Darvish and
Crook continue to work.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 1, Inglewood Police Chief Ronald Banks announced that
Morse, Darvish and Crook would be disciplined, but he refused to
reveal what action would be taken.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Corey Glave said Monday that Darvish and Crook's
punishment could range from reprimand to suspension.</TE>
<TE>   In his request for the temporary restraining order, Glave charged
that the city failed to advise the two officers of their rights when
they were interrogated. He said the city forced them to write reports
about the incident, including their use of force, without informing
them of the "nature of the investigation" or of their right to
representation.</TE>
<TE>   Glave said Darvish and Crook were denied access to investigators'
records, notes and complaints against them before being interrogated.
He also contended that police released Darvish's photograph to the
media without his consent.</TE>
<TE>   Hight ruled that Darvish and Crook might suffer "irreparable
injury" if the city is allowed to punish them before the issue can be
considered in a formal hearing.</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Charles Dickerson said Monday, "I respect the judge's
action, but I disagree with the temporary restraining order. We will
vigorously defend against the [officers'] applications for a
preliminary injunction."</TE>

<HD>Bruce Johnston Sr., 63; Notorious Killer Dies in Prison</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bruce Johnston Sr., one of suburban Philadelphia's most notorious
murderers whose killing rampage became the basis for the movie "At
Close Range," has died of natural causes in prison in Graterford,
Pa., authorities said. He was 63.</LD>
<LD>   Johnston was taken to Mercy Suburban General Hospital on Aug. 5
for complications associated with liver disease. He was returned to
the prison and two days later was pronounced dead, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The convicted killer was serving six life sentences at Graterford
Prison for murdering several of his criminal cohorts and his son's
girlfriend, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   The Chester County, Pa., slayings were the basis for the 1986
film, "At Close Range," starring Sean Penn and Christopher Walken,
whose character was based on Johnston.</TE>
<TE>   Johnston and his brothers operated a multimillion-dollar burglary
ring in the 1970s, stealing everything from cigarettes to tractors,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, he and two brothers were convicted of killing three young
members of their crime ring and were sentenced to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   They were also convicted of killing the girlfriend of John- ston's
son, police said.</TE>
<TE>   According to police, Bruce Johnston Jr., who survived an attempt
on his life, had begun talking about the gang because he believed his
father had raped his girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   The girlfriend and the other victims were killed so they wouldn't
cooperate with authorities, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Chester County Dist. Atty. Joseph W. Carroll, who called Bruce
Johnston Sr. one of the county's "most notorious criminals," said
that Johnston deserved the death penalty but that it was not
available at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's entirely appropriate that he died in prison," Carroll said.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Unified 'Surplus' Quickly Spent</HD>
<DH>Schools: Officials have earmarked most of the extra $228
million for programs and books, and toward this year's budget
shortfall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a big, urban school district with a budget larger than those of
several state governments, $228 million in extra year-end funds
doesn't go as far as one might think.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Unified School District officials were startled to
find last week that they had $578 million left over from the last
fiscal year--far more than the $350 million they had expected.</LD>
<LD>   But most of that money is already spoken for: $184 million is
earmarked for violence-prevention programs, textbook expenditures and
other programs; and $30.5 million will go toward this year's budget
shortfall.</LD>
<TE>   And Supt. Roy Romer hopes to use $76 million for employee health
benefits and workers' compensation expenses. (Health benefits are
still being negotiated, however, and union officials are balking at
what they call one-time "stop-gap" funding.)</TE>
<TE>   After all the committed funds are disbursed, district officials
estimate they will have just $26.5 million left.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the district is worse off now fiscally than it was the
year before.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a surplus," Joe Zeronian, the district's chief financial
officer, said of the newly discovered money.</TE>
<TE>   "We started the [last fiscal] year with $604 million," he said,
"and now we will have an ending balance of $578 million."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, school officials were relieved to have more money
than they thought they would.</TE>
<TE>   Board of Education President Caprice Young said that it was
probably too late to replace $70 million in cuts officials made this
spring that increased class sizes in fourth through 12th grades.
Year-round schools have already opened.</TE>
<TE>   However, Romer has recommended spending $16 million for computers
and software, $25 million in bonuses for schools that increased their
standardized test scores, and $2.9 million for a district reading
program.</TE>
<TE>   Zeronian said he doesn't know why so much money is coming back
this year from several hundred of the district's 6,000 accounts.</TE>
<TE>   In the coming days, his staff will review the formulas from March
that led them to project the initial $350-million year-end balance.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, Zeronian said, the district's estimate has been within
1% of the total general fund budget. Last fiscal year's unexpected
balance is about 5%.</TE>
<TE>   He surmised that furious midyear cost-cutting and constantly
shifting budgets may have thrown off his staff's calculations.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said the discrepancy between the estimated balance and the
actual was a byproduct of having such an extensive bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a large, complex organization, and [we] don't have
week-by-week savings," the superintendent said. "We have to add it up
every three months.</TE>
<TE>   "We're saving money; that's a good thing," Romer said. "But we
didn't have an accurate estimate of how much money we were saving
early enough."</TE>

<HD>Missing Girl, 4, Was Kidnapped, Police Say</HD>
<DH>Crime: Witness reports seeing Jessica Cortez leave Echo
Park with a man and his dog.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY McCARTNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After searching Echo Park Lake for two days for the body of a missing
4-year-old, police said Monday night that they believe she was
abducted in the park by a man with a Chihuahua.</LD>
<LD>   Divers had been combing the lake since Jessica Cortez disappeared
Sunday evening and her 5-year-old brother said he had last seen her
in the water. But on Monday afternoon, police received a call from
someone who said they had seen a girl leaving the park with a man and
his dog, Capt. Douglas Shur said.</LD>
<LD>   Officers who had been canvassing the neighborhood door-to-door
learned from other residents that a man with a Chihuahua had recently
been seen in the park talking to children. By Monday night, Shur
said, police were almost certain Jessica had been abducted.</LD>
<TE>   "In the last few hours, we have switched to make this an abduction
as opposed to a drowning, and we have had additional information that
has led us to believe that we are focusing on a specific individual,"
Shur said.</TE>
<TE>   However, divers will resume their search of the lake at 10 a.m. to
make certain her body is not there, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Police issued an "Amber alert" for the man, described as African
American or Latino, weighing 160 to 180 pounds, 5-feet-8 to 6 feet
tall, 20 to 25 years old, with a tattoo of a cross on his lower left
leg. He was wearing blue shorts and a white T-shirt. The new alert
system notifies media outlets of child abductions.</TE>
<TE>   Police also distributed fliers in English throughout the mostly
Spanish-speaking neighborhood, for which Shur apologized. "We will
correct that next time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica's parents pleaded with her kidnapper for her safe return.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't be afraid of the police," her father, Rafael Cortez, said.
"Please return her safe. Please bring her back."</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials arrived at the lake about 10:30 p.m. Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica's parents were selling food at the park Sunday when she
disappeared about 7:30 p.m. Police were notified at about 9 p.m.
Within an hour, a team of 10 divers were searching the water.</TE>
<TE>   They swam for more than five hours before resting for the
night. On Monday, 30 divers split into four teams and began searching
the lake at 3 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Monday, Rampart Division Watch Cmdr. Michael Daly said
investigators had not ruled out the possibility of kidnapping, but
had "nothing to indicate" that's what happened.</TE>
<TE>   Officials issued an "Amber alert" Monday morning but then canceled
it. California Highway Patrol Assistant Chief Art Acevedo said
authorities had "erred on the side of caution."</TE>
<TE>   Daly said search dogs canvassed the park Sunday night but found no
trace of the girl. Before divers entered the water the next day, two
cadaver dogs were ferried around the lake's north end. Pasquariello
said the dogs could sense oils released by a decaying body.</TE>
<TE>   The search focused on the north shore of the lake and around an
island accessible by a bridge.</TE>
<TE>   The lake varies from a depth of two feet at the edges to up to
seven feet near the bridge, said Vicki Israel, a Department of
Recreation and Parks supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   Israel said the last patrol guard, responsible for checking the
lake and returning paddle boats to a dock, was at the boathouse until
8:30 p.m., but the disappearance had not been reported.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Martinez said she told police Monday that she and her
8-year-old daughter recognized the man in the sketch police were
distributing. About a month ago, she said, he was in the park talking
to children in a deep voice.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa Casteneda, a family friend, said Jessica is a "beautiful,
happy child ... always very happy, always playing."</TE>
<TE>   "I hope people will bring her back," Jessica's father said.</TE>

<LD>The Orange County Transportation Authority on Monday approved a grant
of $3.4 million for Placentia to help solve railroad noise and safety
problems.</LD>
<LD>   The grant, contingent on $500,000 in matching funds from the city,
will fund improvements to rail crossings, such as better-designed
traffic gates and bridges over railroad tracks.</LD>
<LD>   If Placentia can reduce the risk at crossings, city officials say,
they might be able to reinstate a ban on train whistles and horns,
which have been a nuisance for people who live and work along the
main rail lines through town.</LD>

<HD>Ocean Institute Ready to Say 'Ahoy, Mate' to Schoolchildren</HD>
<DH>Education: Rebuilt Dana Point facility will offer in-depth
programs, including overnight stays, for kindergarten through
12th-grade students.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seventy teachers interrupted their summer vacations for a sneak
preview of the nearly completed expansion of the Ocean Institute in
Dana Point.</LD>
<LD>   The recent two-hour tour of the $16.5-million waterfront education
center's remodel left many of the instructors wide-eyed, eager to get
back to school and sign their students up for institute programs,
which are unique in California for their in-depth educational
content.</LD>
<LD>   "I've been coming here for 20 years, and I'm just blown away by
this," said Paulette Powell, a second-grade teacher in Moreno Valley.
"The potential for encouraging and inspiring kids is limitless. There
is such a potential for making science come alive."</LD>
<TE>   The institute, at the west end of Dana Point Harbor, is five times
larger than its predecessor, a 20-year-old marine science center that
was knocked down last year. The research campus now consists of six
buildings. An estimated 135,000 Southern California students a year
are expected to visit the institute's marine labs, travel on research
vessels or spend a night on the tall ship Pilgrim once the facility
reopens in October for educational visits.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the culmination of a long journey for this organization,"
said Harry Helling, vice president of education and research for the
institute. "We're the lab ... every school would love to have but
can't afford."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike similar facilities in San Diego, San Pedro and elsewhere on
the California coast, the institute has the aim of providing detailed
instruction on the ocean and coastal environment for children in
kindergarten through 12th grade. Whereas other marine museums and
aquariums provide displays tailored to the wider public or to
research, the Dana Point institute is geared toward field trips in
which children average nearly seven hours per visit.</TE>
<TE>   "We gear all our tanks and exhibits toward helping support our
educational programs," said Deidre Cavazzi, the institute's
curriculum coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   In the next several weeks, the project, which has taken about 18
months, will enter its final stages, which include filling and
stocking the tanks. The work was privately funded with contributions
that included a $5.5-million gift from philanthropists Henry and
Susan Samueli and $4 million from an anonymous donor. In the past,
the research institute had relied mostly on grants from the city and
state for its operations.</TE>
<TE>   Ocean Institute officials originally considered building a
"Monterey Bay-style aquarium," a reference to the massive tourist
mecca along the central coast city's Cannery Row.</TE>
<TE>   "The community and the teachers gave us a resounding 'no' to the
aquarium idea," institute spokesman Bentley Cavazzi said. "They
wanted us to focus on the teaching aspect."</TE>
<TE>   Teachers who previewed the facility seemed convinced that the
focus was in the right place.</TE>
<TE>   Christine Clark, a science teacher at La Habra's Sonora High
School, said she was impressed that students will be treated as
researchers. "This won't be your typical show-and-tell field trip,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   That became evident as instructors viewed the surf science center
overlooking the ocean, which will give fourth-and fifth-graders a
chance to spend the night just steps from the breaking waves in a
surf-themed tent cabin on surfboard-shaped mats. Students will
discover what makes a perfect wave and will track storms at sea in a
National Weather Service-certified observation station.</TE>
<TE>   A children's theater in the ecology learning center will take
students virtually underwater in an outdoor intertidal pool that
simulates wave action and features a collection of local coastal
organisms. The sea-floor program allows students to explore what
appear to be the ice fields of Europa and conduct underwater
excavation of a city.</TE>
<TE>   For those who can't make the trip to Dana Point, the institute can
link off-site classrooms to real-time experiments at the center or on
one of its research ships.</TE>
<TE>   The center is also expanding its overnight programs to include
three-day trips recreating the 19th century voyage of the HMS
Challenger as well as a Catalina Island Ecology Safari and a Civil
War reenactment.</TE>
<TE>   Students will travel aboard the Spirit of Dana Point and the
research vessel Sea Explorer. The Pilgrim, a working replica of the
130-foot brig that carried author Richard Henry Dana along the
California coast in the early 1800s, will continue to hold overnight
programs.</TE>
<TE>   One of the goals of the Samueli Foundation is to ensure that more
children from low-income families can visit the center. The
institute's board has launched an adopt-a-class program giving local
businesses an opportunity to sponsor trips.</TE>

<LD>I guess it's difficult to concentrate when you're being chased by the
cops. A suspect in Paramount recently peeled off his shirt while on
the run from L.A. County sheriff's deputies but forgot he'd left his
cell phone in a pocket.</LD>
<LD>   Not only that, the city's newsletter related, the guy had
helpfully taped his name and address to the phone. Hello!</LD>
<LD>   Speaking of absent-mindedness: I'm also having a bit of trouble
focusing, this being my first day back after a two-week vacation. In
fact, if you don't mind, I'm going to ease my re-entry by taking some
vicarious trips (see photos).</LD>
<TE>   * In Portland, Ore., Chuck Schroeder of Mission Viejo spotted a
spelling-challenged student's notice about a lost item.</TE>
<TE>   * In British Columbia, George and Glen Patricia Ljubenkov of San
Pedro found a sightseer's attraction that isn't usually available
indoors.</TE>
<TE>   * And Jerry Derloshon of Malibu sent along a shot that his
daughter, Melody, had snapped in Paris, where one theater owner had
trouble with the beginning of "Hollywood Ending."</TE>
<TE>   What I did on my vacation: First, I cut my beard, which evidently
had become a bit too shaggy. A couple of days earlier, I was having
breakfast with my wife in a Long Beach restaurant when a woman walked
up to me and said, "You were great last night." As I was choking on
my granola, her escort apologetically explained that she thought I
was playing the role of the elderly character Captain Andy in the
local production of "Showboat."</TE>
<TE>   I decided a trim might give me a more dashing look for the road
production of "Harvey Family Vacation."</TE>
<TE>   Escape from L.A.: And I couldn't wait to get out of town after
perusing the scary "Yahoo! Travel Guide to Los Angeles" at a rental
car outlet. Some excerpts:</TE>
<TE>   * "Much has been written about crime in Los Angeles through the
years, though overall figures have gone down recently."</TE>
<TE>   * "Be warned, [at Six Flags Magic Mountain] you'll have to deal
with roving, raucous, hormone-crazed teens."</TE>
<TE>   * "Don't let the horror stories about Los Angeles freeways (all
1,000 miles of them) scare you off."</TE>
<TE>   * "Hollywood is all grit and grime.... You're about as likely to
bump into Tom Cruise or Michelle Pfeiffer at Hollywood and Vine as
you are to be around for that 9.0 earthquake everybody yacks about."
You might see Captain Andy, though.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: In San Luis Obispo, where we fled (cell phones in our
pockets), I was delighted to discover that the police department
posts its own dumb-criminal-tricks stories on the outside of its
substation.</TE>
<TE>   The latest involved a parolee who was arrested "after he rode a
stolen bike to a meeting with his parole officer."</TE>
<TE>   It gets better. The reason the theft came to light was that the
perpetrator parked the bike across the street from the store where
the owner worked. Hello!</TE>

<HD>Priestley Moved to Hospital for Drivers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actor Jason Priestley was taken by helicopter to Indianapolis on
Monday, a day after he was seriously injured in an auto racing
accident at Kentucky Speedway.</LD>
<LD>   Priestley, 32, a rookie open-wheel driver in the Infiniti Pro
Series, crashed at nearly 180 mph during final practice for Sunday's
Kentucky 100.</LD>
<LD>   He was being treated for a moderate concussion and a broken back,
among other injuries. He can move his arms and legs and breathe on
his own, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   He was in serious but stable condition Monday in the University of
Kentucky Medical Center's intensive care unit before he was
transferred to Indianapolis' Methodist Hospital, which is known for
its treatment of injured race car drivers.</TE>
<TE>   The accident in Sparta, Ky., involved two head-on crashes.
Priestley's Indy-style car struck the outside wall at 178 mph, then
slid back across the track, coming to a stop after hitting the inside
retaining wall.</TE>
<TE>   Car owner Tom Kelley said having his driver back in Indianapolis,
home base for Kelly Racing, will make it "easier for us to take care
of him and his family. The reconstruction will be done in
Indianapolis on the ankle and foot injuries, which are common. The
good news is: [The car] absorbs a lot of shock. The bad news is: It
mashes your feet--but it probably saves your life."</TE>
<TE>   Priestley, who starred as Brandon Walsh in the 1990s TV series
"Beverly Hills 90210," has homes in New York City and Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The all-oval Infiniti Pro Series is in its first season and was
designed as a steppingstone to the Indy Racing League, which
sanctions the Indianapolis 500 and other U.S. oval-track races.</TE>
<TE>   Priestley has been driving in the Infiniti series since its debut
in early July and had qualified second-fastest for Sunday's race, at
178.122 mph. He lost control when his right rear tire went through
some Oil Dry, a liquid-absorbing substance that had been applied to
the track about 10 minutes earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers had been advised to avoid the spot, but Roger Bailey, the
director of the series, said: "At those speeds, it's sometimes hard
to define where you are on the track. You're only talking about a
foot here or there."</TE>
<TE>   The Kentucky race was the fourth of seven races in the series, but
Kelley said he would not enter a car in the final three races.
Priestley had finished second, sixth and 13th in previous races.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm more concerned with Jason's recovery and well-being than
running three more races at this point," Kelley said. "I was so
pleased with Jason's performance. He finished second in his first
race [at Kansas City], and qualified second at Kentucky when the
conditions were tough. Then this freaky thing happens. It makes us
appreciate when things go right."</TE>

<HD>Alpha Robertson, 83; Her Daughter Died in 1963 Church
Bombing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alpha Robertson, who lost her youngest child in a racist church
bombing in 1963 and testified decades later against two Ku Klux Klan
members convicted in the blast, died Sunday in Birmingham, Ala. She
was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Robertson, who had battled cancer and other illnesses, was
hospitalized two weeks ago and suffered her third stroke.</LD>
<LD>   She was the mother of Carole Robertson, 14, who was among four
black girls killed when 10 sticks of dynamite exploded outside the
16th Street Baptist Church on Sept. 15, 1963.</LD>
<TE>   Robertson testified about that Sunday morning during the recent
trials of Thomas Blanton Jr. and Bobby Frank Cherry, the last two
suspects in the bombing considered the deadliest crime of the civil
rights era.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just an awful sound, like something shaking the world all
over," Robertson, testifying in a wheelchair, said during Cherry's
trial in May.</TE>
<TE>   Both Blanton and Cherry were convicted of murder and sentenced to
life in prison. A third Klansman was convicted in 1977 and died in
prison, and a fourth suspect died without being charged.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson was at home getting ready for church on that September
morning almost 40 years ago when the bomb went off.</TE>
<TE>   Her daughter was primping in the church basement with three
friends--Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley and Denise McNair, all
14--when the explosion brought down part of the brick and concrete
church on top of them.</TE>
<TE>   A friend called Robertson and gave her the news that the church--a
gathering spot for activists, who often had to dodge fire hoses and
police dogs to get there--had been attacked. She finished dressing
and rushed over, only to be sent home by her husband, who had gone to
the church earlier with their daughter.</TE>
<TE>   It was hours before the girls' bodies were removed from the
rubble. They were wounded so badly that they could only be identified
by their shoes.</TE>
<TE>   The girls' deaths drew international attention to the Klan's
violent tactics and galvanized opposition to it. But the failure of
the police and the FBI to prosecute anyone at the time sealed
Birmingham's reputation as a bastion of racism.</TE>
<TE>   Although the FBI identified four suspects within days, no charges
were filed because then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover said an Alabama
jury--probably all white men--would never convict the Klansmen.</TE>
<TE>   Dianne Braddock, Robertson's surviving daughter, said she was glad
her mother lived to see the men found guilty.</TE>
<TE>   "She had lived the courage of her conviction. She was forgiving,"
Braddock said. "She fought a valiant fight considering all the
struggles she's had in her life."</TE>
<TE>   Special prosecutor Doug Jones called Robertson an "amazing lady."</TE>
<TE>   "We referred to her as the moral center of the universe," he said.
"She just had that presence and aura that brought you in and cradled
you."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson, a retired school librarian, was featured in "4 Little
Girls," director Spike Lee's 1997 documentary about the bombings. She
appears showing a string of Girl Scout merit badges Carole had
earned, and a worn Bible that her daughter had in her pocketbook the
day of the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Lee told the Chicago Tribune in 1997 that the heroism of Robertson
and the other parents was the heart of the film. He cited Robertson's
courage and belief in God as particularly inspiring.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson's husband, Alvin, died in 1974. Besides her daughter
Dianne, she is survived by a son, Alvin Robertson Jr.; three
grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>A Favorite 'Uncle' Off the Ballot in Thousand Oaks</HD>
<DH>Politics: Officials bar David Sams from using his nickname
in City Council candidate listings. The TV producer says he will
consider legal action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his first run for public office, David Sams has suffered a
setback, but he's not about to cry uncle.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, he isn't even allowed to say uncle--at least not on the
ballot in Thousand Oaks' upcoming City Council election.</LD>
<LD>   Hoping to list himself on the ballot as "Uncle" David Sams, the TV
producer and Internet entrepreneur was thwarted by city officials,
who also rejected his compromise offer of David "Uncle" Sams.</LD>
<TE>   "The city of Thousand Oaks is trying to take 'Uncle Sams' out of
the political arena," said Sams, 44. "I can't think of a better
nickname to run under."</TE>
<TE>   Still "shocked," Sams joins such frustrated office seekers as Al
Lewis, better known to TV fans as Grandpa Munster. Running on the
Green Party ticket for governor of New York, Lewis was barred by
state officials and the courts there from calling himself "Grandpa"
Al Lewis on the 1998 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   With that case in mind and the California elections code at hand,
Thousand Oaks officials took "uncle" out of the running Friday. Sams
had submitted the signatures required for candidacy by Friday's
deadline, they ruled. However, he'd have to lose the "uncle"--despite
its added significance as a tribute to his great-uncle David Remley,
a World War II submariner.</TE>
<TE>   "The election code says his name is to appear on the ballot, and
he was asking for something other than his name to appear there,"
Assistant City Atty. Tim Giles said. A shortened, informal version of
a candidate's given name--"Bill" for William or "Dave" for David, for
instance--would be acceptable, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a personal decision," Giles said. "We wish Mr. Sams the
best in his candidacy."</TE>
<TE>   For Sams, that might not be enough. He said Monday he might take
legal action.</TE>
<TE>   "As Americans, we have the right to use our names and put them out
there before the public," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If I want to run as 'Uncle' David Sams, I should be able to. Look
at Jesse Ventura, for crying out loud: That's his wrestling name!"</TE>
<TE>   Sams said close friends have called him "Uncle" since high school.
Professionally, though, he shelves the patriotic reference.</TE>
<TE>   He has a business dealing in Internet domain names that's called,
simply, SamsDirect.com, sans "uncle." His credits on TV productions
are also uncle-less.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County election officials said the law allows cities some
discretion on a number of ballot questions.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Bruce Bradley, assistant registrar of voters, said he
hadn't come across a case like "Uncle" Sams' in his 22 years on the
job.</TE>
<TE>   "When you register, you give your given name, and when you run,
you have to run as you're registered," Bradley said. "If you're
registered as William Cody, you can't run as 'Buffalo Bill' Cody."</TE>
<TE>   This isn't Sams' first conflict over a name.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, he upset the publisher of Archie comics when he
registered a Web site on behalf of his baby daughter called
veronica.org.</TE>
<TE>   Archie Comics Publications claimed that its trademark for the name
Veronica--one of the ageless strip's teenage characters--gave it
rights to the Web site name, but the company later backed down.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like David fighting Goliath," Sams said.</TE>
<TE>   A Thousand Oaks resident for two years after moving from Bel-Air,
Sams acknowledged that the uncle brouhaha might give him some of the

<HD>Secession Offers Clout, Latino Candidates Say</HD>
<DH>Breakaway: Contenders for Valley offices say nine of the 14
council districts would have Latino pluralities, creating
opportunity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With 17 Latinos running for office in a proposed San Fernando Valley
city, several of the candidates said Monday that the election
presents an opportunity for their community to increase its influence
in municipal government.</LD>
<LD>   Half a dozen Latino candidates, including two contenders for
mayor, held a news conference in Sylmar in anticipation of an event
planned for Friday by the new Latino Coalition for a United Los
Angeles. At that event, Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Panorama City),
state Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar) and City Council President Alex
Padilla are planning to detail how they see secession harming the
Latino community.</LD>
<LD>   At the pro-secession event, candidates, including Oscar Mendoza,
noted that Latinos would make up 42% of the population of the
proposed Valley city. The current Los Angeles council includes just
one Valley councilman who is Latino, and there is no Latina on the
City Council.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a historic opportunity for Latinos in the San Fernando
Valley," said Mendoza, a small-business owner running in the 2nd
District. He noted that two Latinas are also candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The 17 Latino candidates are among 120 contenders in the Nov. 5
election for 14 city council seats in the proposed Valley city and
one mayoral seat.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists said the council district maps that would take
effect if voters approve the Valley's breakaway this fall indicate
that the Latino population would form a plurality in nine of the 14
council districts.</TE>
<TE>   However, Irene Tovar, a leader of the anti-secession Latino group,
noted that Latinos in only four of the Valley city council districts
represent more than 44% of the registered voters, the percentage that
some demographers say gives a voting group a strong ability to elect
a candidate of its choice.</TE>
<TE>   Tovar said recent redistricting created five of the 15 City
Council seats in Los Angeles in such a way that Latino voters will
have powerful sway over the choice of their representatives. "We
don't think Latinos will benefit from secession," she said, adding
that there is concern about whether the new city will adopt existing
rent-control and living-wage laws.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Clayton of the California Latino Redistricting Commission
said that although five Latinos currently serve on the City Council,
one of those districts has low enough Latino voter registration that
it is not clear whether Latinos could continue to dominate voting in
that area.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Ferreyra, who is running in the Valley city's 12th
District, also noted that council districts in the proposed city will
each include fewer than 100,000 people, compared with up to 250,000
for each Los Angeles district.</TE>
<TE>   "Latinos in the Valley can be assured that they will be closer to
their municipal government in a new Valley city," Ferreyra said.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-secession event on Friday is being held by a coalition
that includes the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational
Fund, the Latin American Civic Assn. and the San Fernando Valley
chapter of the Mexican American Political Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In preparation for the event, Padilla and County Supervisor Gloria
Molina flew to Sacramento on Monday to meet with Latino state
legislators who represent the Los Angeles area and who they would
like to become more active in opposing the breakup.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, three new groups filed papers with the city
Ethics Commission on Monday to begin fund-raising to weigh in on the
issue: African Americans/Latinos Against Secession, Free Hollywood
and Valley Residents Against the Breakup.</TE>
<TE>   With the flurry of activity Monday involving Latino leaders, both
sides on the secession issue are signaling that they will battle hard
for the Latino vote, which is so far divided.</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles Times poll on July 2 found that 52% of Valley voters
and 59% of Valley Latino voters favored secession, while only 38% of
voters citywide and 36% of citywide Latino voters favored the
breakup.</TE>
<TE>   A poll commissioned by KABC-TV Channel 7 and released Monday
similarly found that a majority of likely voters in the city as a
whole wanted to keep Los Angeles together, while a majority of likely
voters in the Valley supported the breakup.</TE>
<TE>   While secession advocates and critics argued about Latino voting
strength Monday, the county registrar-recorder announced that one
mayoral candidate will not appear on the ballot. Wayne "T-bear"
Crochet of Van Nuys has been eliminated from the list of mayoral
candidates because he did not file sufficient signatures, the office
said.</TE>

<HD>Library Plan Is a Lightning Rod in El Sereno</HD>
<DH>Government: The $4.3-million project is highlighting
divisions on the new, advisory Neighborhood Council and in the
community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSE CARDENAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What could be controversial about a new $4.3-million library for the
children of a needy community northeast of downtown Los Angeles?</LD>
<LD>   In El Sereno, plenty. A bitter disagreement over one of El
Sereno's biggest public works projects is illuminating the growing
pains of a newly certified Neighborhood Council that is attempting to
exercise its advisory role and unify a community historically
bisected by distrust between two camps.</LD>
<LD>   The cast of characters:</LD>
<TE>   * The Los Angeles 32 Neighborhood Council, which some perceive as
synonymous with the middle-class community of Hillside Village, and
as the "Beverly Hills" of El Sereno. The council's library committee,
working without the full support of the council, opposes the site of
the new library.</TE>
<TE>   * Activists of the broader El Sereno community, who largely favor
the library site and are puzzled by what they perceive as the full
Neighborhood Council's opposition to the project.</TE>
<TE>   * Los Angeles Councilman Nick Pacheco and representatives of the
city Library Commission, who approved the site.</TE>
<TE>   * Alvin Parra--a key member of L.A. 32--who opposes the library
site and is running against Pacheco to represent that area.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is a modern, 10,500-square-foot library. Those who
support the new library site fear that the opposition of L.A. 32,
which has considered legal action to force officials to evaluate
other sites, might endanger the project, on which preliminary grading
work has already begun.</TE>
<TE>   There's much going on in the background of the dispute that the
parties don't disclose to each other. That has fanned distrust and
stirred up a bewildering array of questions, rumors and suspicions.</TE>
<TE>   Some in L.A. 32 ask: Do public officials really respect the
Neighborhood Council's role as an advisory body to the city?</TE>
<TE>   "Here we are, certified, and they are not listening to us," said
Hugo Garcia, a member of L.A. 32's library committee. The committee,
without the support of the entire Neighborhood Council, is heading
the protest.</TE>
<TE>   Others who do not feel represented by the Neighborhood Council
ask: Is the official platform of L.A. 32--a group intended to be a
unifying force in the community--being politicized to promote one
candidate over another?</TE>
<TE>   "If the community was supportive of what happened, then why not"
let it go forward? asked Richard Acosta of the project. He recently
gathered 1,300 signatures in an attempt to counteract opposition to
the site.</TE>
<TE>   To some in L.A. 32, there's a bigger issue.</TE>
<TE>   The El Sereno project to be constructed at 5226 S. Huntington Dr.
was supposed to be an extension of the existing library, which is
about three blocks south on Huntington. But when library officials
could not persuade a property owner to sell, they obtained the new
site by swapping the site of the existing library, built in 1924, for
a parcel owned by Century Housing.</TE>
<TE>   Today, L.A. 32's library committee cites a number of points of
dissatisfaction with the new site, from traffic safety to its
proximity to Alhambra and relative distance from El Sereno's schools.</TE>
<TE>   But their chief complaint is that Pacheco and library officials
did not conduct a site search, which they say was required because
this is a new project.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about understanding how the site was selected and our
community was sidestepped," said Linda Arreola, a member of L.A. 32's
library committee.</TE>
<TE>   There are no legal mandates dictating when site searches should be
made, said Susan Kent, Los Angeles city librarian. Traditionally,
though, when plans call for a new building, library authorities
conduct a site search.</TE>
<TE>   This site, because it was close to the original library and
because it started as an expansion project, was chosen without a full
site search, Kent said.</TE>
<TE>   "At no time did anyone say it was not a good idea," she said,
adding that there had been three community meetings to discuss the
library's design.</TE>
<TE>   But some L.A. 32 members are unconvinced. "It's not a good site
for the library," said Mark Santarelli, another member of L.A. 32's
library committee. "It's not a process that involved the community."</TE>
<TE>   The conflict comes as newly certified neighborhood councils in the
city are becoming active and as L.A. 32 is trying to represent an
area with two distinct communities, long suspicious of one another.</TE>
<TE>   To outsiders, El Sereno is one big neighborhood of 50,000
residents northeast of downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Hillside Village, or "The Village," as some call it, is the area
around Wilson High School, up in the hills. The flatland below is a
district of apartment houses and lower property values.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents see Hillside Village as a snobbish community that
looks down on the rest of El Sereno. "I'm 46," said Acosta. "Since I
was a kid, there has always been that friction with Hillside Village,
because they have always thought they are better than everybody
else."</TE>
<TE>   Some El Sereno residents suspect hidden motives in L.A. 32's
opposition to the new library site. The council wants the library
closer to Hillside Village, one theory goes, to embarrass Pacheco and
promote Parra.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate that individuals are trying to accuse me of
using this process as a political steppingstone," Parra said. "The
reality is that a process and a practice has not been honored, and
that should be the issue ... not whether I'm running against
Pacheco."</TE>
<TE>   As the rumors fly, some in L.A. 32 fear that the perception that
the Neighborhood Council's role is being used for political purposes
will harm the group's main aim of unifying the community.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of thing is destructive to everybody, because I feel
that the councils have a purpose," said Eddie Duran, L.A. 32's
interim president. "And the reason the city put these councils
together is to benefit the community, not separate or destroy them."</TE>

<LD>A judge on Monday blocked the city of Inglewood from punishing two
police officers for their alleged involvement in the July 6 beating
of 16-year-old Donovan Jackson.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Bob Hight issued a
temporary restraining order prohibiting city officials from taking
actions against Officers Bijan Darvish and Antoine Crook. Last week,
another judge issued a similar order forbidding the city from firing
Officer Jeremy J. Morse, who was caught on videotape slamming Jackson
down on a police car and then punching him in the jaw.</LD>
<LD>   The orders are effective pending hearings to decide whether
preliminary injunctions will be issued against the city. The hearings
have been scheduled Aug. 28 for Morse and Aug. 29 for Darvish and
Crook.</LD>

<HD>Simon Could Be Called to Testify at Trial in S&amp;L Suit</HD>
<DH>Politics: The GOP gubernatorial candidate may take the
stand weeks before the election. He and other investors sued the U.S.
over the failure of the business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Justice Department has put Republican gubernatorial nominee
Bill Simon Jr. on its witness list for a savings and loan trial that
starts next month in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   The tentative schedule would have Simon on the stand Oct. 16--less
than three weeks before the election.</LD>
<LD>   The trial stems from a lawsuit that Simon and other investors in
the former Western Federal Saving and Loan filed against the
government. The Simon family lost its $40-million investment in
Western Federal, which was based in Marina del Rey, and hopes to win
at least some of it back.</LD>
<TE>   The government seized the S&amp;L in 1993 at a cost to taxpayers of
$122 million.</TE>
<TE>   The trial before Judge Emily C. Hewitt at the U.S. Court of
Federal Claims in Washington is scheduled to start Sept. 17 and
finish by Oct. 18.</TE>
<TE>   In court papers, the Justice Department has named Simon as one of
26 witnesses it may call. Simon would testify for up to two hours on
"the strategies, plans, operation and condition" of Western Federal
and its holding company, Justice Department lawyers wrote in court
papers.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department spokesman Charles Miller said the government
had not subpoenaed Simon, but "that may change."</TE>
<TE>   For Simon's campaign, the candidate's testimony would draw
untimely attention to what Gov. Gray Davis has cited as one of his
rival's biggest failures as a businessman.</TE>
<TE>   In television ads, the Democratic incumbent has blamed the
government's "bailout" of Western Federal on mismanagement by Simon.
"On top of it all," a narrator says in one ad, "Simon is suing the
government, asking taxpayers to pay him back his investment."</TE>
<TE>   Simon has denied wrongdoing and accused Davis of grossly
distorting his role at Western Federal.</TE>
<TE>   Simon did not run day-to-day operations at the S&amp;L. He was,
however, a member of the team that oversaw those who managed the
thrift. For two years, Simon was on the Western Federal board of
directors. For the next two years, he served on the board of Westfed
Holdings Inc., a company that owned one business: Western Federal.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon investors said the government improperly seized Western
Federal after breaking an agreement that it struck with the investors
when it acquired the thrift in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "The government didn't keep its word on this issue, so we feel
we're on the right side," said Simon campaign spokesman Mark Miner.</TE>
<TE>   The government, however, has argued in court papers that the Simon
group made an ill-advised investment in Western Federal, then
retained executives who mismanaged the S&amp;L, making its collapse
inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis reelection campaign has cast Western Federal's failure
as evidence that Simon is not the successful businessman he portrays
himself to be. The Davis effort was bolstered by widespread news
coverage of a fraud verdict handed down by a jury July 30 in a
separate case against Simon's investment firm, William E. Simon &amp;
Sons.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Simon has struggled to shift the campaign's focus to
Davis' track record as governor.</TE>
<TE>   Allan Hoffenblum, a GOP consultant, said, "The only way Simon can
get back into the game" is "to turn the race back into a referendum
on Gray Davis."</TE>
<TE>   "If it's three weeks before the election, and the issue is still
Bill Simon, and not Gray Davis, he's in trouble anyway," Hoffenblum
said.</TE>

<HD>Separated Twin Sisters Improving Daily</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Formerly conjoined Guatemalan twins Maria Teresa and Maria de Jesus
Quiej Alvarez were steadily improving Monday after last week's
surgery to separate them, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "They are continuing to improve ever so slightly every day," said
Dr. Irwin Weiss, pediatric intensive care specialist.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors have reduced their anesthesia, although they are still
heavily sedated.</LD>
<TE>   "Hopefully in the next several days they'll be able to breathe on
their own," Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   The year-old girls, who shared portions of their skull and several
important blood vessels, came to UCLA's Mattel Children's Hospital
from Guatemala in June. After the 22-hour surgery, Maria Teresa was
rushed back to the operating room to remove a pool of blood under her
scalp.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Teresa is improving, although Maria de Jesus is more
responsive to stimuli, including clapping. Maria Teresa "is catching
up," Weiss said.</TE>

<HD>'S' Word Is Left Off the Menu at Lunch</HD>
<DH>VICA: Local officials show up for meeting with Valley
business leaders, but agree not to chew on secession.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The iced tea was poured and the ground rules were set: Just because
six Los Angeles City Council members were on hand Monday to face more
than 100 San Fernando Valley business leaders didn't mean the
conversation had to be about secession.</LD>
<LD>   "The first elected official who brings up the 'S' word ... you're
buying lunch," said George Stavaris, a Van Nuys real estate broker
who moderated the meeting of the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn.</LD>
<LD>   It's not that the business group's leaders think proposals for new
cities in the Valley and Hollywood are dead in the water, they said.
They're simply tired of seeing every issue debated through the filter
of secession.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to have plenty of opportunities to talk about
secession," said VICA Chairman Fred Gaines. The group has invited
representatives from both sides of the debate to make their cases on
Aug. 22, after which members will be polled to determine the
association's official position.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers of Monday's lunch said they had never seen such a
turnout of "the electeds" for VICA's annual event for local
government leaders. All but one of the council members representing
the Valley showed up--Councilman Hal Bernson sent an aide--and Mayor
James K. Hahn sent a deputy to the meeting at the Airtel Plaza Hotel
in Van Nuys. And it wasn't for the chicken piccata and raspberry
cheesecake.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the threat of secession" explained the officials'
showing, said Jill Barad, a VICA board member.</TE>
<TE>   Representing areas with a smaller stake in the secession debate
were the mayor of the city of San Fernando, the vice mayor of Simi
Valley and a councilwoman from Santa Clarita.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, the panelists managed to sidestep secession.
They endorsed Hahn's proposals to alter Los Angeles' methods for
taxing businesses and they agreed that Los Angeles should do more to
prepare for terrorist attacks. One person asked whether a
professional football team would move into downtown, to which
officials responded maybe, but not with taxpayer money. Another asked
how Los Angeles would accommodate growth.</TE>
<TE>   "Our infrastructure is basically collapsing" under the weight of
so many residents, said Councilman Dennis Zine, using the opportunity
to oppose the 3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch development proposed near the
Ventura County border.</TE>
<TE>   "Ahmanson is not the answer to our housing crisis," Zine said.</TE>
<TE>   All of the issues raised will remain relevant whether the Valley
becomes its own city or not, so "it's a good discussion to have in
any case," said James Stewart, who was in the audience. A
parliamentarian in Panorama City, he supports Valley independence and
is running for the council of the proposed city.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Wendy Greuel fielded a question about her proposal to
divide the city into boroughs. As Greuel delicately discussed the
alternative to splitting Los Angeles, she wondered aloud, "Am I
jeopardizing my lunch?"</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A rape suspect who threatened to stab himself to death was arrested
early Monday by Ventura County sheriff's deputies following a
six-hour standoff at his Camarillo home.</LD>
<LD>   Gary Scott Moneta, 21, was booked on suspicion of rape, false
imprisonment and criminal threats.</LD>
<LD>   The incident began just after 6 p.m. Sunday in the 100 block of
Spanish Moss Place, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   A woman who authorities said was in a relationship with Moneta
called deputies to tell them she had been raped and that the suspect
was under the influence of methamphetamines and carrying a knife,
Sheriff's Department spokesman Eric Nishimoto said.</TE>
<TE>   The victim also told authorities that before she fled the
residence, Moneta said he would not let deputies take him to jail.</TE>
<TE>   After several attempts to contact Moneta by phone, SWAT officers
forced their way into the home using flash-bang devices--loud
explosives that emit bright lights to distract or stun a suspect--and
arrested Moneta, Nishimoto said.</TE>
<TE>   Moneta was treated at St. John's Regional Medical Center for a
self-inflicted knife wound to the neck and then was taken to Ventura
County Jail, where he was being held Monday in lieu of $500,000 bail.</TE>

<LD>A South Whittier man pleaded not guilty Monday to charges that he had
stabbed to death four members of a neighboring family, including an
8-year-old girl who, authorities allege, was sexually assaulted.</LD>
<LD>   Alfonso Ignacio Morales, 23, wearing a yellow and blue County Jail
uniform, appeared briefly at Norwalk Superior Court before Judge
Michael A. Cowell. Morales appeared beside his attorney, public
defender Jerry Weil.</LD>
<LD>   As he was being led from the courtroom, Morales looked back, his
eyes searching for his mother and stepfather, who were sitting at the
back of the courtroom.</LD>
<TE>   His next court appearance is scheduled for Oct. 2. Morales is
being held without bail at Twin Towers jail in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The bodies of Miguel Ruiz, 38; his wife, Maritza Trejo, 41; their
daughter, Jasmin; and Ruiz's grandmother, Ana Luisa Martinez, 79,
were found July 13 by relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Morales, who was described by Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department investigators as a neighbor and family friend of the
victims, was arrested the next day.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office filed an
eight-count complaint, charging him with the murders, robbery,
burglary and sex offenses against a child.</TE>
<TE>   Special circumstances, such as multiple murder and murder during
the commission of lewd act on a child, could make Morales subject to
the death penalty.</TE>

<LD>Woodbury University and Los Angeles Valley College, using a
five-year, $3-million federal grant, have partnered to increase the
number of students earning bachelor's degrees.</LD>
<LD>   The collaboration, called Cooperative Collegiate Connections,
encourages students from Valley College, a community college in
Valley Glen, to transfer to Woodbury, a private, four-year university
in Burbank.</LD>
<LD>   Both are considered Hispanic Serving Institutions, a U.S.
Department of Education designation given to colleges and
universities with Latino student enrollments of 25% or more. One of
the goals of the project, funded under Title V of the Higher
Education Act, is to increase the number of Latinos graduating with
bachelor's degrees.</LD>
<TE>   "What we really want this to be about is access," said Don St.
Clair, Woodbury University's vice president for enrollment and
management. "We want students to understand that transferring to
private institutions is possible for them, affordable for them."</TE>
<TE>   Administrators from both schools will form a steering committee to
determine how to spend the grant money.</TE>
<TE>   Among the items to be discussed are an advertising campaign to
encourage transfers, more academic advisors for students wishing to
transfer and financial aid information programs.</TE>
<TE>   Raul Castillo, executive director of Valley College's nonprofit
foundation, the Patrons Assn., also worked to get the grant. He said
he hopes to fund a mentoring and tutoring program between the
schools, online aid for transfer students and remediation courses for
new students. "What this program offers is a lot of interactions
between the two schools and an opportunity to be successful at both
places," Castillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Several Southern California colleges have received cooperative
Title V grants, including Ventura College, Cal State San Bernardino
and Glendale Community College.</TE>
<TE>   The Woodbury-Valley College project is to begin in the fall. St.
Clair said the best part about the partnership is that "it allows us
to reach these students and say, 'Just because the seats are full at
Cal State doesn't mean they can't attend a good school.' "</TE>

<LD>Esteban Loaiza gave up one run in 7 1/3 innings to win on the road
for the first time in six starts, leading the Toronto Blue Jays over
the Oakland Athletics, 2-1, Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   Loaiza (5-6) last won on the road May 31 at Detroit. He gave up
seven hits, struck out three and walked two.</LD>
<LD>   The Blue Jays beat Oakland for the fifth consecutive time and
sixth in the last seven this season.</LD>
<TE>   Loaiza has given up only one run in 16 2/3 innings against the A's
in two starts. He threw his only shutout of the season against
Oakland on May 19. Last year Oakland pounded the right-hander for 14
runs and 19 hits in 10 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Kelvim Escobar gave up a leadoff triple to Terrence Long in ninth
before finishing for his 24th save in 30 opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Harang (4-3) gave up two runs and five hits over seven

up, 2-1.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: After Erstad's triple, consecutive homers help
rout Tigers, 7-0, as Appier gets win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This was how the Angels, sudden contenders, were supposed to handle
the dregs of the American League.</LD>
<LD>   Blow 'em out.</LD>
<LD>   Courtesy of a big fifth inning, in which they had back-to-back
home runs and sent 11 batters to the plate, the Angels enjoyed a
laugher at the expense of the bottom-feeding Detroit Tigers Monday
night, pounding the American League Central's last-place team, 7-0.</LD>
<TE>   Immediately after going an impressive 12-8 in a string of games
against a group of contending teams (Minnesota, Oakland, Seattle,
Boston and New York) that entered Monday with a combined .596 winning
percentage, the Angels were an ordinary 4-3 against the
less-than-fearsome faction of Detroit, Chicago and Toronto, teams
that were winning at a .434 clip to start the week.</TE>
<TE>   With the victory, the Angels (70-48) increased their lead in the
AL wild-card race to a full game over the Red Sox and moved within
two games of the AL West-leading Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers (45-73), meanwhile, continued to possess the
second-worst record in the league.</TE>
<TE>   Angel starter Kevin Appier (10-9) earned the win, his first home
victory since May 20. Appier, 0-6 in his last seven home starts, gave
up three hits in 6 2/3 innings. The right-hander walked four and
struck out three.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought my stuff was good, really good for me," Appier said.
"My control left me at times, but my stuff made up for it and the
bullpen shut them down."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' pitching staff has thrown 22 consecutive scoreless
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit starter Mark Redman (7-10) suffered the loss. The
left-hander gave up six runs, five earned, and nine hits in four-plus
innings. Redman walked two and struck out one.</TE>
<TE>   In front of 19,709 at Edison Field, it took the Angels all of two
batters to score in the first inning.</TE>
<TE>   After David Eckstein led off with a triple into the left-field
corner, Darin Erstad's sacrifice fly to center field allowed Eckstein
to scamper home and gave the Angels a 1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   They added another run in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Spiezio, batting third in the lineup for the first time this
season and in place of the injured Tim Salmon, was on first base with
a one-out single when Garret Anderson doubled into the right-field
corner.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit right fielder Robert Fick fumbled the ball around and the
lumbering Spiezio was able to score.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels blew it open in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad led off with a drive to deep right that seemed catchable,
but Fick couldn't bring it in. With Erstad racing to third with a
triple, Redman screamed at his right fielder.</TE>
<TE>   A disturbed Redman then gave up a first-pitch, two-run home run to
the switch-hitting Spiezio, who entered the game batting .350 as a
right-handed hitter. It was Spiezio's seventh homer of the year, his
third from the right side.</TE>
<TE>   Two pitches later, on an 84-mph curveball, the left-handed hitting
Anderson launched a towering shot than landed in the right-field
seats.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's 20th homer of the year tied him with Troy Glaus for the
team lead.</TE>
<TE>   It was also the sixth time the Angels had hit consecutive home
runs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying anything's easy," Spiezio said with a smile when
asked if batting ahead of Anderson and Glaus made his job easier in
the No. 3 spot.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fun to have some success in that spot," said Spiezio, who
was two for four with two runs scored and two RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   After Redman walked Glaus one batter later, the Detroit starter's
night was finished, although the Angels were just getting started.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus scored on a Tiger error while Detroit attempted a double
play, and Alex Ochoa, who joined the Angels in a July 30 trade with
the Milwaukee Brewers, had his first RBI as an Angel with a single
that drove in Shawn Wooten, who had singled.</TE>
<TE>   Appier said the Angels can't get caught up in scoreboard watching
while they play the likes of the Tigers and Seattle faces the Red Sox
and Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   "Regardless of what a team's record is," Appier said, "they can
beat you on a given night. [Detroit's] record isn't that good, but
they have some talent ... but we know who's playing who."</TE>

<HD>Players Optimistic About Talks</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The news out of the players' union meeting Monday morning in Chicago
was welcomed in the Angel clubhouse Monday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   With word filtering out that the players had yet to set a strike
date, the Angels considered it a positive sign that a work stoppage
may be averted.</LD>
<LD>   "That's what we all hope for," said center fielder Darin Erstad.
"The head of the players' union decides what's best, and that's the
decision he made so hopefully that means we're making progress."</LD>
<TE>   Angel player representative Scott Schoeneweis returned from
Toronto to Anaheim with the club Sunday night but did not comment on
the proceedings. Jarrod Washburn attended the meeting in his place
after pitching Sunday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "We're encouraged with how things are going and we didn't see the
need to set a date," said Washburn, who returned to Edison Field
during the Angels' 7-0 win over Detroit. "My gut feeling is that
something is going to get worked out. Nobody wants a strike."</TE>
<TE>   Angel right fielder Tim Salmon said that not setting a strike date
was a move in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   "To get all those guys in Chicago, and they didn't come out with a
strike date, I mean to me that's an optimistic sign," Salmon said.
"That's not just a conference call. That's a pretty good effort, and
to come out of it without [a strike date], they must have a reason
for that. It will just be interesting to see how the next few days
transpire."</TE>
<TE>   Said Manager Mike Scioscia: "Right now there's enough progress in
negotiations not to warrant a step of setting a strike date, but
people have to realize that by no means is it out of the woods yet."</TE>
<TE>   The American League West-contending Angels have not allowed the
possibility of a strike to overshadow their surprising success a year
after finishing 41 games out of first place.</TE>
<TE>   "Not one bit," Erstad said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't talk about it, and it's something that will take care if
itself, one way or the other. We can only control it to a certain
point so we're focused on playing baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just concerned about playing the Tigers ... and that
[strike-related] stuff, there's people with a lot more experience
that know a lot more about the issues at hand, and they can think
about that stuff. I'm going to think about our team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hit on the bottom of his left hand by a pitch Saturday, Salmon
took three batting practice swings Monday and decided to sit out for
the second consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still obviously sore, but the big thing is grip strength,"
Salmon said. "You expect it to be sore, but if I can't hold the bat
and swing with the authority that I expect, I mean I'm not going to
[test it]. Right now we're talking two days out, so it's not worth
it."</TE>
<TE>   Racked by injuries, Salmon had career-low numbers in batting
average (.227), home runs (17) and runs batted in (49) in 2001. He is
currently batting .297 with 18 homers and 76 RBIs.</TE>

<HD>A Rolling Argument</HD>
<DH>Bowden has some key supporters, many critics in "Let's
roll" debate</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lexicon of football language has been long littered with
war-related phrases, but determining whether to accept or refuse the
controversial new submission by Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden is a
debate in progress.</LD>
<LD>   By installing "Let's roll" as his Seminoles' 2002 motto, Bowden
has inspired critical and patriotic arguments by drawing a parallel
between the Sept. 11 story of United Airlines Flight 93 and the
challenge of a college football season.</LD>
<LD>   "You know, you're going to die and instead of panicking, they go
in there and try to keep them from blowing up the White House, or
whatever they were trying to blow up," Bowden said last week while
explaining his reasoning behind the motto's establishment. "I
consider those guys heroes. Let's honor them."</LD>
<TE>   That logic is flawed, say critics.</TE>
<TE>   "[Bowden] is a very tremendous, decent guy who sees bigger issues
than football, which makes this so surprising," said David Hyde, a
South Florida Sun-Sentinel columnist. "I think most people back Bobby
on this issue--and Seminole fans would back him even if he made the
motto 'Let's 'Nole'--but I believe any time you mix war and sports
that trivializes a real tragedy. Bobby, even with the best of
intentions, did that."</TE>
<TE>   After a telephone conversation with GTE supervisor Lisa Jefferson
on the morning of Sept. 11, Flight 93 passenger Todd M. Beamer, an
account manager for Oracle software, was heard saying, "Are you guys
ready? Let's roll."</TE>
<TE>   Before he uttered the phrase, Beamer, 32, the married father of
two young boys whose wife, Lisa, delivered a third child, daughter
Morgan Kay, in January, told Jefferson he and other passengers were
preparing to overtake a group of hijackers aboard the Boeing 757 that
departed from Newark, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Flight 93 crashed in a remote field in western Pennsylvania. All
44 aboard were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Doug MacMillan, Beamer's best friend who serves as chief executive
of the nonprofit Todd M. Beamer Memorial Foundation, said the
courageous message during the tragic circumstances has served as an
ongoing source of inspiration for many in the days and months after
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "What it means is a chance to reflect and stop to think about
Sept. 11, think about how we learned a big lesson that day and how we
should be proud about moving on," MacMillan said.</TE>
<TE>   A self-described history buff, Bowden, 72, wants his Seminoles to
move forward after dealing with an uncharacteristic 8-4 season in
2001--a showing that ended strings of 14 consecutive top-five
finishes in national polls and 13 straight 10-win seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Florida State, loaded with a dominant offensive line, is ranked
No. 3 in the Associated Press poll and No. 4 in the ESPN/USA Today
coaches' poll. If the Seminoles beat Iowa State on Aug. 24, Bowden
will pass Alabama's Paul "Bear" Bryant with his 324th career victory.</TE>
<TE>   Bowden's team makes use of bombs and blitzes, but Hyde says
roaring "Let's roll!" before each game is unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   "Bobby didn't put this to a team vote, he just decided it," Hyde
said. "The fact is what you've got now are 18-and 19-year-olds
talking about getting together as a team like the nation did after
Sept. 11. These mixed metaphors--are they thinking about the national
tragedy or getting motivated for a Saturday afternoon football
game?--just feel wrong."</TE>
<TE>   MacMillan defused much of the immediate backlash by announcing the
Beamer Foundation's support of Bowden last week. MacMillan was
invited by Bowden to address the Seminoles and he will do so today as
the team conducts two-a-day practices while wearing white "Let's
roll" T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   "I want them to understand Todd's life was not boiled down to two
words, that he was a man of great character who was willing to lay
down his life for this," MacMillan said. "I want someone who
understands the sincerity and the magnitude of what he did. I believe
Coach Bowden knew the story very well and this [motto] was a natural
progression for him."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Bowden has opened himself to ridicule by earlier referring to
Beamer as "that guy on that plane." A Tampa Tribune columnist added
that after Bowden detailed his explanation of the motto idea by
telling a condensed story of the Flight 93 tragedy to reporters on
media day Aug. 4, he asked, "Any tears yet?" and smiled.</TE>
<TE>   The sensitivity toward Sept. 11 in the sporting community has been
obvious. Major League Baseball fined Cincinnati Red General Manager
Jim Bowden (no relation to Bobby) an undisclosed sum after he
assessed labor talks by saying, "If players want to strike, they
ought to just pick Sept. 11, because that's what it's going to do to
the game.... Be symbolic. Let Donald Fehr drive the plane right into
the building, if that's what they want to do."</TE>
<TE>   MacMillan said he's convinced Bobby Bowden respects Beamer and his
legacy of the foundation, which has raised more than $2 million for
the 5,000-plus children whose parents were Sept. 11 victims.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach called me last week to introduce himself and told me he was
a God-loving, patriotic man," MacMillan said. "I told him he had
bigger things to worry about this year than 'Let's roll.' "</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Hobby, an assistant for sports information and athletic
promotions at Florida State, said the controversy has not resulted in
a flood of complaints by telephone or e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   "I've taken two calls on it today--one supportive, one
disagreeing," Hobby said. "We get far more phone calls on injuries,
like last year when [senior wide receiver] Robert Morgan hurt his
knee."</TE>
<TE>   Hobby said she's been told by university officials that the motto
is no more than a motivational tool for the locker room. The Florida
State football posters have already been made, equipped with the
slogan, "Lay it on the line"--with a photo of the offensive linemen.</TE>
<TE>   Brett Marhanka, sports information director for Wheaton College in
Illinois, where Beamer played baseball, said his school created a
patch for baseball players in the spring that listed Beamer's No. 23
and "Let's roll." Additionally, Marhanka said the Wheaton Rolling
Thunder football, soccer and volleyball teams ended each huddle last
year by shouting "Let's roll!"</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to honor Todd without being over the top," Marhanka
said.</TE>
<TE>   MacMillan said the Beamer Foundation has applied for a trademark
of "Let's roll," through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. A
spokeswoman for the office said a decision on trademark registration
for the phrase probably will be made in 12 to 18 months, although a
30-day challenge period is expected to be necessary because two
others without ties to Beamer have applied for the same trademark.</TE>
<TE>   The Beamer Foundation has struck a deal with Wal-Mart to begin
selling "Let's roll," T-shirts and hats beginning during the first
week of September with profits distributed to the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation is coordinating retreats and mentoring/educational
opportunities for the children of Sept. 11 victims and other New York
youth suffering psychological effects.</TE>
<TE>   MacMillan said he wouldn't mind if Florida State began producing
merchandise with "Let's roll," as long as the profits were directed
to the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "I will make it known to [Bowden and university officials] that we
are trying to raise a significant amount of money for our
organization and how we feel that if anyone should benefit from this,
it is the children," MacMillan said.</TE>
<TE>   An avid sports fan, MacMillan said today's meeting with Bowden and
the Seminoles is bittersweet.</TE>
<TE>   "The only guy I know who would get what a thrill it is to meet
Bobby Bowden is my best friend," MacMillan said. "But Todd is gone."</TE>

<LD>The Washington Redskins have a new leader, and it's all anybody seems
to want to talk about in the nation's capital.</LD>
<LD>   "There hasn't been this kind of buzz in town since Joe Gibbs left
10 years ago," writes Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post.
"Everywhere I go, everybody asks the same question: 'How do you think
he'll do?' And nobody has to ask who he is.</LD>
<LD>   "There are about 70 players in training camp, a bunch of them with
Pro Bowl experience, and right now none of them matter. It's like
they're all made out of wood, and Steve Spurrier is Gepetto With a
Visor.</LD>
<TE>   "It's all about him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who besides Mark Hendrickson, a 6-foot-9 pitcher who
played for the Philadelphia 76ers, Sacramento Kings and New Jersey
Nets before making his major league debut last week with the Toronto
Blue Jays, are the only athletes to play in both major league
baseball and the NBA?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Limping along: Barry Bonds hit homer No. 600, but he hasn't been
himself in the outfield because of an injured hamstring. Scott Ostler
of the San Francisco Chronicle writes: "God help him out there, you
think, if he has to chase anything down. Or bend over to pick up a
base hit, or a hot-dog wrapper."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cheap shot: Defensive end Jason Taylor of the Miami Dolphins,
whose exhibition Thursday night against the New Orleans Saints will
be their second in four days: "I feel like a baseball team.
Unfortunately we can't stand out in the outfield and rest."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   High-five for Herman: Coach Herman Edwards of the New York Jets,
chiding his players for excess celebrating: "When you catch a ball
for a first down, when you make a great tackle, that's your job. It's
not to entertain everyone after you make the play."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   End of story: This might be sacrilege to Johnny Most fans, but Bob
Ryan of the Boston Globe says of Chick Hearn: "He was the greatest
basketball radio play-by-play man who ever lived. That's
nonnegotiable. He called the game faster, crisper and sharper than
anyone."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hazeltine hater: Said Dave Hill, the runner-up in the 1970 U.S.
Open at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minn., site of this
week's PGA Championship: "They ruined a good farm when they built
this course."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1978, the Baltimore Orioles won a
game via the rain-out rule. The Orioles were leading New York, 3-0,
after six innings but the Yankees scored five runs in the top half of
the seventh. Heavy rains ended the game in the bottom of the inning
and the score reverted to the end of the last completed frame giving
the Orioles the win. The rule was changed in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Danny Ainge, Gene Conley, Dave DeBusschere, Dick
Groat, Frank Baumholtz, Cotton Nash, Ron Reed, Chuck Connors and
Steve Hamilton.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Says Deborah Kellom of Perpetua, a Tucson company
that builds personalized funeral "sets," among them one offering a
fishing scene with a rod cast into a pond stocked with goldfish and
another featuring a recliner in front of a television set showing
sports highlights:</TE>
<TE>   "People didn't know they could do this, but now they've embraced
it. There's still grieving, but there's more laughter now."</TE>

<LD>   What: "Biography: Pele: World Cup Hero."</LD>
<TE>   Where: A&amp;E, today at 5 p.m. (repeats at 9)</TE>
<TE>   "World Cup Hero?" In the parlance of the sport, that title is a
well-executed dummy, a slick bit of sleight-of-foot, because this
excellent documentary about soccer's most famous player is anything
but an exercise in hero worship.</TE>
<TE>   As presented here, Pele's story is equal parts extraordinary and
mundane: A brilliant talent, he was more globally famous than Babe
Ruth or Michael Jordan, he changed his sport forever, he broke racist
color barriers in his native Brazil, he played on an unprecedented
three World Cup championship teams ... and he succumbed to many of
the run-of-the-mill trappings of athletic superstardom, both during
and after his career.</TE>
<TE>   Pele scored 1,283 goals during a professional career that spanned
more than two decades, 1957 to 1977, securing his legend as soccer's
greatest player.</TE>
<TE>   Revisionists have claimed that Pele would not have been nearly so
prolific had he played today, against the current breed of faster,
more physical defenders carrying out the negative game plans of
coaches cynically maneuvering to preserve their own employment at any
cost.</TE>
<TE>   This documentary argues just the opposite, providing vivid verbal
and visual evidence that Pele was a victim of his time--beginning his
career when there were no red or yellow cards, when players were
rarely ejected and thus were freer to hack, kick and brutalize Pele
because ordinary defensive tactics were never sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   Former teammate Pepe argues that if Pele played today, "he'd score
2,500 or 3,000 goals, because today's players are better protected
[by the referee] and fitter."</TE>
<TE>   Off the field, Pele was beset by a different array of problems,
many of them his own doing. He went bankrupt twice, sold out to the
corporate gods, fathered several illegitimate children and is
portrayed as an absentee parent who ruined his first marriage by
neglecting family concerns in order to further his business career.</TE>
<TE>   Typical of the documentary is the even-handed treatment given
Pele's two-year stint with the New York Cosmos. While crediting Pele
for helping spawn "the first American soccer boom," the program duly
notes that Pele signed with the Cosmos--for $6 million--mainly to pay
off numerous business debts.</TE>

<HD>Relief Isn't Spelled S-H-U-E-Y Yet for Dodgers</HD>
<DH>Baseball: He has 10.80 earned-run average, two losses and
two blown saves since trade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>Dodger reliever Paul Shuey, trying to keep some perspective on his
tumultuous tenure in Los Angeles since his trade from Cleveland on
July 28, shook his head, rolled his eyes and emitted a half-hearted
chuckle when he sized up his struggles.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been extremely frustrating, and it's been tough to sleep,"
Shuey said Monday about a string of recent difficult outings. "I've
had to retrain my thoughts and adjust my pitching style. It's been a
really interesting two weeks. It seems like it's been a year."</LD>
<LD>   Unless Shuey and his fellow relievers, who have combined for a
5.77 earned-run average since July 21, snap out of their slump, it
will seem as if it's about 2006.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who open a three-game series against the Montreal
Expos today, traded one of their top pitching prospects, Ricardo
Rodriguez, to get Shuey, whom Dodger right fielder Shawn Green deemed
"one of the top five nastiest guys I've ever faced."</TE>
<TE>   With a 95-mph fastball, sharp split-fingered fastball and solid
curve, Shuey was supposed to provide the extra footing the Dodgers
needed to complete the bridge from their starting pitchers to closer
Eric Gagne. But that bridge has only gotten wobblier.</TE>
<TE>   Shuey, whose ERA in his last nine appearances with the Indians was
0.90, has a 10.80 ERA, two losses and two blown saves in nine games
with the Dodgers. In 6 2/3 innings, he has given up owed 12 hits, 11
walks and eight earned runs, and he has yet to work a 1-2-3 inning.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander gave up three runs in the eighth inning of a 6-3
loss to Philadelphia on Sunday night. He was rocked for a grand slam
by Phillie outfielder Pat Burrell on Friday night. He was charged
with three runs in the eighth inning of a 7-5 loss to Philadelphia on
Aug. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Giovanni Carrara, another right-hander, claims his arm feels
"better than ever," but he has been torched in his last four outings.
He gave up a two-run homer to Philadelphia's Mike Lieberthal on
Saturday night, and he hit two batters with the bases loaded in the
eighth inning, forcing in the go-ahead runs in a 7-5 loss to the
Phillies on Aug. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Carrara gave up a game-tying, two-run double to Cincinnati's Jason
LaRue in the ninth inning of a 6-4, 13-inning loss to the Reds on
Aug. 1 and a home run to Cincinnati's Adam Dunn on July 30.</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Jesse Orosco has been solid, giving up one earned run
in his last nine innings, but his status is questionable because of
back stiffness.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne has been one of baseball's dominant closers, with a 2.01 ERA
and 39 saves in 41 opportunities, and set-up man Paul Quantrill has
been every bit the workhorse the Dodgers had envisioned, going 3-4
with a 3.05 ERA and 25 holds in a major league-high 65 games.</TE>
<TE>   But overall, a bullpen that was one of baseball's best in the
first half of the season has blown six save opportunities and given
up 13 homers in the last 20 games.</TE>
<TE>   "Pitchers are no different than hitters--they have peaks and
valleys," Manager Jim Tracy said. "When one is in a valley, you just
hope you have enough around him to ride it out."</TE>
<TE>   The lack of relief has put a considerable strain on Tracy, who
can't seem to go a game without making a hand-wringing pitching
decision. He used to turn to Carrara in tight spots, but the Dodgers'
confidence in him appears to be waning.</TE>
<TE>   Carrara's role has diminished since the first half, when he was a
primary set-up man, and that has reduced the bullpen's depth.</TE>
<TE>   "If we have a chance to win now, we're going to go for it," Tracy
said. "We're not going to get beat at the expense of getting
so-and-so straightened out."</TE>
<TE>   Shuey's struggles have strained the back of the bullpen. When the
Phillies loaded the bases in the eighth inning against Shuey on
Friday night, Gagne, who has nine relief appearances of more than one
inning, wasn't even warming up.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to build the bridge to Quantrill and Gagne, because if we
look beyond that and get ourselves in a situation where we're going
to other guys sooner, they're going to get tired out there," Tracy
said. "I can't pitch Gagne in the eighth inning every day."</TE>
<TE>   A rash of close games, most determined in the late innings, has
caused the bullpen much duress.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't been fatigued, but for me, the mental part of being up
a run, tied, or down a run late in the game day after day has been
tough," Quantrill said. "You don't often go out there and say, 'You
know what? Today I'm going to work on my slider.'</TE>
<TE>   "We're always tight and, mentally, it gets to be draining when
you're tight every night.... There hasn't been a lot of room for
error, and even if you give up one tough run, it can give you a loss.
Sometimes that can put you in a slump, because you let the team down.
But you'd rather be in tight games every night than getting spanked."</TE>
<TE>   The bullpen could receive a huge boost with the addition of
left-hander Omar Daal, who could be demoted from the rotation when
Kevin Brown returns this week. But if Kazuhisa Ishii remains in the
rotation ahead of Daal, it will be on a short leash. If the
struggling Japanese left-hander has another rocky start or two, Tracy
probably will replace him with Daal, leaving the bullpen a little
thinner.</TE>
<TE>   An effective Shuey would have the biggest impact on the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   "Bullpens live and die together--when everyone is doing their
small job, everyone can do the big job easier," Shuey said. "I plan
to be a key ingredient in this, and I'm trying to help, but for
whatever reason, it isn't working out.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no change in my routine or thought process here. I've
gone 0 and 2 to a lot of guys and haven't finished them off. I have
to have faith that I'm going to come out of it, and if I do, it will
be beneficial for the team. I just can't put too much pressure on
myself."</TE>

<HD>Jordan May Land on DL</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>An MRI test and a bone scan on Brian Jordan's lower back revealed a
small protrusion Monday, a condition that will likely send the Dodger
left fielder to the disabled list and, possibly, could require
season-ending surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan, who missed two-thirds of the 1997 season because of a
bulging disk, will receive a cortisone injection today and will be
re-evaluated in Los Angeles, while the Dodgers begin a three-game
series in Montreal.</LD>
<LD>   "The doctors think it might be an old injury; that's why he's
getting the injection," General Manager Dan Evans said. "They want to
see if that alleviates the situation. We're waiting for answers, but
it makes no sense for him to travel now."</LD>
<TE>   Jordan, who is batting .271 with 13 home runs and 50 RBIs but
hasn't homered since July 6, thought he suffered the injury during an
Aug. 5 game in Philadelphia when he jerked backward to avoid a
high-and-tight pitch.</TE>
<TE>   He played Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday but aggravated the
injury Thursday when he made a diving catch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The name across the front of Eric Gagne's uniform reads "Dodgers,"
but bring up the Montreal Expos and Gagne starts speaking in
proprietary tones, as in "we" had the best record in the major
leagues in 1994, and 1981 was the only year "we" went to the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "They're always going to be my team," said Gagne, the Dodger
closer who grew up a diehard Expo fan in Montreal. "When I was 15 or
16, I lived five minutes from Olympic Stadium and would go to 30-40
games a year."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne is such an Expo fan that when he was called up to the big
leagues for the first time in 1999, he could barely look Dodger radio
broadcaster Rick Monday in the eye. Monday is the former Dodger whose
Game 5 home run clinched the 1981 National League championship series
victory over Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   "That was my worst memory as an Expos' fan," Gagne said. "I was 5
years old at the time. For years, I told [Monday] I hated him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy has decided not to skip Kazuhisa Ishii or Omar
Daal in the rotation this week--Ishii will start Wednesday and Daal
will start Thursday against the Expos. That means Brown will likely
return Friday night against the New York Mets.</TE>
<TE>   The starts by the struggling Ishii, who has given up 17 earned
runs in 12 2/3 innings of his last three starts, and Daal, who has
given up 10 earned runs in 26 1/3 innings of his last four starts,
will give each pitcher one last chance to convince Tracy he belongs
in the rotation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek, who suffered a mild strain of
the medial collateral ligament in his left knee Sunday night, made
considerable progress Monday and is expected to start against
Montreal tonight.</TE>

<HD>Players Back Off Selecting Strike Date</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Union says it's encouraged, delays setting
deadline; if talks lag, support for Sept. 2 or Sept. 16.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>The Major League Baseball Players Assn. signaled its hope Monday of
reaching a labor agreement by postponing a decision on setting a
strike deadline.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiations have been more civil and sincere than those in
previous collective bargaining, and players feared establishing a
deadline could have angered owners and derailed the process.</LD>
<LD>   Union head Don Fehr made the surprising announcement after a
3-hour 45-minute, closed-door meeting of the executive council at an
airport hotel, saying players were encouraged enough about the tone
of recent discussions to "hopefully, over the next several days, find
a way to address the remaining issues" between them and owners.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue sharing and the contentious issue of a payroll tax remain
the two biggest hurdles to completing a deal that would avert
baseball's ninth work stoppage since 1972, but players indicated
their willingness to at least continue talking this week.</TE>
<TE>   The executive council has scheduled a Friday conference call to
reevaluate the status of negotiations, resuming today in New York,
and whether a strike date would be necessary. Fehr declined to
discuss specifics of the meeting at which every club except the
Dodgers, who had scheduling conflicts, was represented, but two union
sources said potential strike dates of Aug. 30, Sept. 2 and Sept. 16
were discussed.</TE>
<TE>   A date was not selected, the sources said, but there is growing
support for Sept. 2 or Sept. 16 if negotiations continue to lag on
the core economic issues. Owners are aware of the dates the union is
leaning toward if a deal is not completed soon.</TE>
<TE>   The sides are $150 million apart on revenue sharing in an industry
that last year generated a record $3.55 billion in revenue, with
owners at $400 million and the union at $250 million. The union also
wants the payroll tax component to be eliminated, putting everything
under one umbrella of transferring money from high-revenue to
low-revenue clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Owners have said they would not initiate a work stoppage this
season, vowing not to lock out players through the World Series, but
they could unilaterally implement new work rules after the postseason
is completed, prompting the union to retain its primary bargaining
chip of a potential strike despite its optimism about talks.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, there may not be enough time to complete an agreement
before Friday's conference call because of management's demand to
slow escalating player salaries by taxing teams with high payrolls,
and the union's strong opposition to that proposal, but the buzzer
hasn't sounded yet.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone would argue that setting a strike date would
throw a wrench into the whole process," said Atlanta Brave pitcher
Tom Glavine, who sources said was the most vocal player in the
meeting. "We all understand what happens if a day is set, and the
rhetoric that starts with that. The players have said, over and over
again, that we are serious about trying to get a deal done.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel like there's a window of opportunity to hopefully get
something done in the next few days. We're willing to explore that
without going down the road of having to throw a strike date into it,
and what that may do to either hurt the process or end the process
altogether. It hurts nobody by giving it a couple of extra days."</TE>
<TE>   Although pleased the union did not turn up the heat by scheduling
a walkout or making the potential strike dates public, owners said
the onus is still on both sides to avert a strike.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't feel at all defensive," Rob Manfred, baseball's lead
labor lawyer, said in a conference call. "First of all, you need to
evaluate what they did today against the backdrop that we pledged
months ago not to interrupt the season at all.</TE>
<TE>   "Both parties feel pressure to reach an agreement because of the
enormous harm that would [be] caused by a strike. Both parties have
shown flexibility in an attempt to get to a common ground, with
respect to those core economic issues, and the next few days will be
full, busy days for us."</TE>
<TE>   The union last set a strike date July 28, 1994, triggering a work
stoppage that lasted 232 days and wiped out the playoffs and World
Series, returning to work only after a federal judge found owners
guilty of illegal labor practices.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations this season have progressed steadily since resuming
in earnest after the All-Star break. Agreements have been reached on
such minor issues as increasing the minimum salary to $300,000,
starting next year, and the sides are moving closer to completing a
plan for steroid testing after the union made a major policy shift in
ending its long-standing opposition to mandatory drug testing.</TE>
<TE>   "I see a difference based on the content of the negotiations this
time around, as opposed to '94," said Glavine, a senior member of the
union's board. "In '94, there was virtually no chance we would reach
an agreement without a work stoppage. They were talking about a
salary cap, and we weren't. In this negotiation, we have been talking
about virtually the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   "It boils down to luxury tax, revenue sharing and some other
things that I think we've all been willing to talk about. It's just
sometimes a difference in philosophy, and how you're going to reach
certain goals, and that is a far easier bridge to gap than the one we
had in '94."</TE>

<HD>Rose Bowl Joins Forces With Moag</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a move that underscores their interest in landing an NFL team,
Rose Bowl officials have struck a deal with John Moag, the stadium
consultant who helped clear the way for the Cleveland Browns to move
to Baltimore.</LD>
<LD>   Moag cannot officially be hired until the move is approved today
by the board of directors of the Rose Bowl Operating Company, and
Monday by the Pasadena City Council.</LD>
<LD>   Moag, chairman of Moag &amp; Co., a Baltimore-based sports investment
banking firm, has agreed to a two-year deal that does not include
up-front money, but will pay him a "success fee" of as much as $5
million if he can broker a deal that puts an NFL team in the Rose
Bowl for at least 15 years.</LD>
<TE>   "In order to be successful, we needed somebody of John Moag's
character to join our team," said Darryl Dunn, general manager of the
Rose Bowl. "He's done it. He's proven. And we are motivated to
solidify our stadium situation."</TE>
<TE>   Dunn has been in contact with league officials and said they have
encouraged him to do everything he can to make the stadium NFL-ready.
The Rose Bowl faces long odds, however, for a number of reasons,
including limited freeway access, neighborhood concerns and no clear
financing plan.</TE>

<LD>Results from an MRI exam on the swollen left knee of Terrell Davis
showed no structural damage, but Denver's star running back isn't
sure when he'll be able to practice again.</LD>
<LD>   Davis, who has had four knee surgeries in three years, had a
cortisone shot on Monday to reduce the swelling and another injection
to help ease an arthritic condition in his knee.</LD>
<LD>   "They didn't see anything that required surgery," Davis said. "I
was hoping it could have been a better situation if they had seen
something and said this is it. There are a lot of different variables
now. It is obviously not clear. We will see and go from there."</LD>
<TE>   Davis, who had surgery on his left knee twice in the last year,
had been running hard and seemingly pain-free during camp but
couldn't play last week against Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Jon Gruden era with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers is off to a
successful start.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Murphy returned the opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown
and Rob Johnson threw a four-yard touchdown pass to Keenan McCardell
as the Buccaneers defeated the Miami Dolphins, 14-10, at Tampa, Fla.,
in their exhibition opener.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trent Dilfer's chances of starting Seattle's regular-season opener
don't look good. Seahawk Coach Mike Holmgren said that tests on the
right knee Dilfer injured last Saturday indicated he would be out
four to eight weeks. That makes his status very doubtful for the
team's Sept. 8 regular-season opener at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Green Bay Packer receiver Terry Glenn's strained left knee is
worse than first thought and he'll miss a week to 10 days of camp.
Glenn has been sidelined since Wednesday with a strained ligament in
his left knee.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Jamir Miller, who is out for the season after tearing
his right Achilles' tendon in Cleveland's exhibition opener, was put
on the injured reserve list by the Browns. He underwent surgery on
Monday and will need five to six months to make a full recovery.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carolina Panther Coach John Fox said rookie DeShaun Foster of UCLA
has earned some playing time with the first team after his
performance in last Saturday's exhibition against the Washington
Redskins. Foster rushed for 87 yards in seven carries, including a
61-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo's offensive line, already down two injured starters,
suffered another blow when both starting left tackle Jonas Jennings
and his replacement, Marcus Price, were hurt. Jennings sprained an
ankle and was on crutches after Monday's practice. Price was knocked
unconscious and diagnosed with a concussion.</TE>

Running back Frank Moreau agreed to a two-year contract with the
Kansas City Chiefs.... Detroit Lion rookie running back Luke Staley

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sammy Sosa connected again, hitting his major league-leading 40th
home run and No. 490 of his career, but it wasn't enough as the
Houston Astros defeated the Chicago Cubs, 9-6, Monday night at
Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   Sosa has five home runs and 16 runs batted in in three games.
Coming off a big weekend at Coors Field, his two-run shot made him
only the third player in National League history with five
consecutive 40-homer seasons.</LD>
<LD>   Hall of Famers Ralph Kiner (1947-51) and Duke Snider (1953-57)
also accomplished the feat.</LD>
<TE>   In a game in which Cub ace Kerry Wood and Houston pitcher Roy
Oswalt were both ejected, the Astros took a 9-2 lead and held on.</TE>
<TE>   Daryle Ward led the Astros with three RBIs and a career-high four
hits, finishing a triple away from hitting for the cycle.</TE>
<TE>   The bad news for Houston is that shortstop Julio Lugo will be out
six weeks with a broken left forearm after being hit by a pitch from
Wood.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 10, Pittsburgh 6--Scott Rolen hit a three-run homer and
Albert Pujols drove in four runs as the Cardinals won at Pittsburgh.
Rolen, who was six for 40 (.150) in his first 11 games since his
trade from Philadelphia, has homered and driven in three runs in two
consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 1, Florida 0--Jason Jennings became the winningest rookie
in Rockie history and Todd Helton hit an RBI double in a victory over
the Marlins at Miami. Jennings (13-5) surpassed Armando Reynoso's
franchise record of 12 wins in 1993. Florida's A.J. Burnett pitched
his sixth complete game.</TE>

<HD>Autopsy Shows Porter Had Cocaine in System</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>Former All-Star catcher Darrell Porter had cocaine in his system when
he died, according to autopsy results released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Porter, 50, had a level of cocaine in his system "typical of
someone who uses [cocaine] recreationally," Jackson County medical
examiner Dr. Thomas Young said.</LD>
<LD>   Young would not be more specific, saying measurements of cocaine
in the body after death can be unreliable and can vary depending on
where blood is drawn. It was unclear when Porter took the drug.</LD>
<TE>   Porter did not die of an overdose, Young said, but of a condition
called excited delirium, which causes "behavior that is agitated,
bizarre and potentially violent," and stopped Porter's heart.</TE>
<TE>   Porter, the most valuable player of the 1982 World Series with the
St. Louis Cardinals, was found dead Aug. 5 next to his car in a park.</TE>
<TE>   During spring training in 1980, Porter checked into a
drug-and-alcohol rehabilitation center. He chronicled his struggle
with addiction and recovery from it in a 1984 book, "Snap Me Perfect!
The Darrell Porter Story."</TE>
<TE>   Young said "heat exposure" and an enlarged heart, common among
drug users or those with high cholesterol, contributed to Porter's
death.</TE>
<TE>   There was no evidence to support earlier speculation by
authorities that Porter tried to push his stalled car off a tree
stump at a nearby park. They had guessed Porter might have overheated
in high heat and humidity.</TE>

<HD>Harrington Working on Being 'the Man'</HD>
<DH>Golf: Despite never having won a major or a U.S. event,
Irishman could be Europe's best hope at final major.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHASKA, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Padraig Harrington walked through a wall of autograph seekers on his
way to the practice range Monday at Hazeltine National Golf Club when
one exuberant fan shouted, "Awwright Padraig! You the man, bay-bee!"</LD>
<LD>   "I always worry about a man calling me 'baby,' " Harrington said.</LD>
<LD>   The 30-year-old Irishman has no problem being referred to as "the
man."</LD>
<TE>   Never mind that Harrington has never won a major, has never won in
America, has never even won the money title on the European Tour.</TE>
<TE>   Having finished in the top 10 in the previous three majors,
Harrington has emerged as a top candidate to end Europe's 72-year
winless drought in the PGA Championship.</TE>
<TE>   He had no expectations at Augusta National. He has plenty of them
at Hazeltine, site of the final major of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "When you've played well in the first couple of them, there's a
self-induced pressure and a bit of pressure from the outside," he
said. "At Augusta, it's a major and you're trying your best. But this
week, there are people thinking I've got an outside chance. It puts
more tension into the week."</TE>
<TE>   Then he paused and smiled, relishing the thought of the added
pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "You know you're doing well when you have it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington certainly has had his chances.</TE>
<TE>   He tied for fifth at the Masters, and although he was six strokes
behind Tiger Woods, it was as close as he had ever been in a major.
He played with Woods in the third round of the U.S. Open, fading on
the weekend with rounds of 73-75 to tie for eighth.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was Muirfield.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington was nearly flawless in the final round of the British
Open, five under for the day when he came to the 18th hole believing
he needed to make birdie to have any chance at the Claret Jug.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of playing it safe, he hit driver into the bunker, pitched
out sideways and wound up with a bogey to finish one stroke out of
the playoff.</TE>
<TE>   He makes no apologies for being so aggressive. At the time, he was
one stroke behind eventual winner Ernie Els and had just come off a
birdie on the par-five 17th in which he reached the green with a
three-iron from a sand-filled divot.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't believe how much confidence I had going to the 18th
tee," he said. "Maybe I felt too good. I didn't care if I finished
second, third, fourth, fifth, eighth, 10th, 20th. I was just trying
to win."</TE>
<TE>   He and Sergio Garcia are the only players with top-10 finishes in
the three majors, and Harrington says that's no accident.</TE>
<TE>   It's a tossup between Harrington and Vijay Singh who spends more
time on the practice range. Even at the Williams World Challenge,
Woods' end-of-the-year tournament in California that is supposed to
be played for good times and lots of money, Harrington was hitting
balls until he could no longer see where they landed.</TE>
<TE>   The work is starting to bear results.</TE>
<TE>   After six runner-up finishes last year in Europe, Harrington ended
the season with a victory at the Volvo Masters in Spain and climbed
to No. 14 in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the attention among full-time European players has been on
seven-time Order of Merit winner Colin Montgomerie, Lee Westwood of
England, and Darren Clarke, best known for beating Woods in the
finals of the 2000 Match Play Championship at La Costa.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington performs quietly and efficiently, and he is starting to
believe he belongs at the top of the list among European contenders.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel a lot more comfortable at No. 7 in the world now than I
did at No. 14 at the start of the year," he said. "That's the change
in confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Does he consider himself Europe's best player?</TE>
<TE>   "At this moment, that's the truth," he said. "Things change very
quickly. Guys come and go with form. I've shown consistency in form,
and other Europeans have shown flashes of better form in a shorter
period of time."</TE>
<TE>   The turning point in the season came at Bethpage, when he was
paired with Woods and was treated to the circus that comes with it.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington shot a 73 that Saturday, while Woods put together an
even-par 70 to build a four-stroke lead on his way to another U.S.
Open victory.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he left New York feeling closer than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it was playing with Tiger," he said. "You get to see the
guy winning the tournament. I didn't walk away from Bethpage feeling
like, 'I should have won this' or anything like that, but I walked
away feeling capable.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a significant step."</TE>
<TE>   The next is winning, and the challenge will be just as formidable.
Woods is coming off a victory in the Buick Open, and his confidence
and game appear to be on cruise control. Els is coming off his first
major victory in five years.</TE>
<TE>   And history is hardly on Harrington's side. The last European-born
player to win the PGA Championship was Tommy Armour in 1930, when it
was a match-play format.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, Tony Jacklin of England won a U.S. Open at Hazeltine
in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   "I've worked on my game," Harrington said. "It's starting to show
some benefits, and hopefully, it will keep going."</TE>

<HD>Hall of Famer Slaughter Dies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DURHAM, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Enos "Country" Slaughter, the hustling Hall of Famer who made a "Mad
Dash" home to win the 1946 World Series, died Monday at age 86.</LD>
<LD>   Slaughter had been in the intensive care unit of Duke University
Medical Center after colon surgery July 25 and an operation to repair
perforated stomach ulcers July 29. He was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins
lymphoma in June.</LD>
<LD>   He batted .300 in 19 seasons and played in five World Series. He
spent the first 13 years of his career with the St. Louis Cardinals.</LD>
<TE>   "He was one of the great hustlers of baseball," Hall of Fame
teammate Stan Musial said Monday. "He always ran hard and played
hard."</TE>
<TE>   Pete Rose, nicknamed "Charlie Hustle" in the 1960s for his
hard-nosed play, copied Slaughter's habit of running to first base on
a walk.</TE>
<TE>   Slaughter is best remembered for his "Mad Dash" from first base
that scored the winning run for the Cardinals against the Boston Red
Sox in the eighth inning of Game 7 of the 1946 Series.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied, 3-3, and two out, Slaughter took off for
second on what he said later was an attempted steal and scored on a
soft hit to the outfield for the deciding run.</TE>
<TE>   Slaughter joined the Cardinals in 1938 and, except for missing
three years to serve in World War II, stayed in St. Louis until being
traded to the New York Yankees in 1954. Known as an outstanding
clutch hitter, he played in 10 consecutive All-Star games; in 1946 he
hit .391 and led the National League with 130 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Slaughter had career 2,383 hits, including 169 homers, and 1,304
runs batted in in 2,380 games. He retired in 1959 and was eligible
for the Hall of Fame in 1964, but wasn't elected until 1985.</TE>
<TE>   "I think with my record, I deserved to be in there at least 10 to
15 years before I went in," he said in 1994. "A lot of guys went
through that era, but I hit better than they did. They went in and
never did get to .300. I think when you stay in the big leagues and
hit .300, I think you need consideration."</TE>

<HD>Akwari Signs to Play in MLS</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nelson Ndukwe Akwari, former UCLA and current U.S. under-23 national
team defender, Monday cast his lot with Major League Soccer, agreeing
to join the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, who acquired him in a
lottery draft.</LD>
<LD>   The Houston-born Akwari, 20, is one of the most promising central
defenders in the U.S. national team program. He co-captained the
American team that finished fourth in the 1999 FIFA under-17 World
Championship in New Zealand, where his teammates included U.S. World
Cup 2002 players Landon Donovan and DaMarcus Beasley.</LD>
<LD>   Akwari also played for the U.S. under-20 national team that
competed in the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship in Argentina and
is a starter on the under-23 team that is preparing for the 2004
Olympics in Athens.</LD>
<TE>   "It's late in the MLS season, but I think it was a good
opportunity for me to sign now," Akwari said. "Teams know what they
need right now, and as the games get bigger and more important, it's
an opportunity for me to step in and play in high-intensity games."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. performance in reaching the quarterfinals of this year's
World Cup was the deciding factor for Akwari, who was a starter for
two years at UCLA, although his father, Bill, had played for USC.</TE>
<TE>   "The World Cup was a key in making my decision, with the players
from MLS competing so well," he said. "It tells me that if I come to
this league and work hard, I can maybe someday be where those players
are at."</TE>
<TE>   Turkish Prank</TE>
<TE>   Turkey might have finished a surprising third in the World Cup,
but its domestic season has not taken long to produce its first
bizarre incident.</TE>
<TE>   According to reports out of Istanbul, a knife-carrying Fenerbahce
fan nicknamed "Rambo" hid behind the advertising boards at
Galatasaray's Ali Sami Yen Stadium, ran out onto the field before the
game and planted the yellow-and-blue flag of rival Fenerbahce.</TE>
<TE>   When police moved to arrest him, Rambo briefly held them at bay
with the pocket knife before being hauled away to the jeers and
taunts of the fans.</TE>
<TE>   Keane Explains</TE>
<TE>   Ireland midfielder Roy Keane, who was sent home from the World Cup
in disgrace after a run-in with Coach Mick McCarthy, explained that
what caused his banishment was an accusation by McCarthy that Keane
was faking injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Keane told the Times of London in an interview published Monday
that he had been "set up" by McCarthy, who wanted to rid the team of
a disruptive influence.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have played in the World Cup despite all that [the
name-calling between the two] if McCarthy hadn't accused me of faking
injuries," he said. "They dangled a carrot for me and I had a good
nibble."</TE>
<TE>   Romario Still Scoring</TE>
<TE>   The new Brazilian league season began over the weekend and, not
surprisingly, Romario, the hero of Brazil's 1994 World Cup-winning
team, was the focus of attention.</TE>
<TE>   A crowd of 67,000 came to Maracana Stadium, where Romario, 36,
made his debut for Fluminense and scored twice in a 5-1 victory over
Cruzeiro.</TE>
<TE>   Rising From the Ruins</TE>
<TE>   When former Italian power Fiorentina folded last month amid a
mountain of debt, it left Florence without a soccer team, but only
briefly.</TE>
<TE>   City officials found a savior in businessman Diego Della Valle,
who agreed to finance a new team, Fiorentina 1926, which will begin
in the Italian fourth division.</TE>
<TE>   Della Valle hired 1982 World Cup-winning defender Pietro
Vierchowod as the team's coach.</TE>
<TE>   South Koreans Play On</TE>
<TE>   It has been almost a month since the Galaxy announced that it was
going to acquire a Korean player, and on Monday the MLS team watched
another 2002 World Cup star sign elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive midfielder Song Chong-Gug was acquired by Feyenoord of
the Dutch league for $4 million from the Busan I-cons of the
K-League.</TE>
<TE>   One of Song's World Cup teammates, forward Cha Doo-Ri, 22, has
signed a five-year contract with Bayer Leverkusen of the German
Bundesliga.</TE>

<LD>   Radio--KPLS (830).</LD>
<TE>   Records--Sparks 24-7, Mercury 11-20.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Mercury--2-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The season is distilled to its simplest form. If the
Sparks win tonight (or if Houston loses at home) they will be seeded
first in the Western Conference, clinching home-court advantage as
long as they are in the postseason. L.A. would open the playoffs at
fourth-place Seattle. If the Sparks finish the season tied with
Houston, the Comets will be seeded first because they have the
tiebreaker edge, and L.A. will open at Utah. The Sparks' first game
of the playoffs will be Thursday or Friday, depending on matchups.
Phoenix knocked Portland out of the playoffs Sunday with a 73-70
victory and would love to play spoiler again. But Phoenix hasn't
beaten L.A. since July 17, 1999, losing nine in a row.</TE>

<HD>Game Isn't Over; It's AEG's Move</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Three weeks of tennis in Southern California--something of a
mini-Slam with better weather and smaller crowds--were bound to
answer some questions heading into the U.S. Open, create new ones and
leave others dangling.</LD>
<LD>   The major lingering question from the last few weeks: Will they
stay or will they go?</LD>
<LD>   The Carson issue hovered over the proceedings at UCLA and
Manhattan Beach like the Goodyear Blimp (of the three just-completed
tournaments, the middle one, at Carlsbad, remains unaffected).</LD>
<TE>   It might appear that the men's event at UCLA and the women's
tournament at Manhattan Beach, which finished Sunday, are staying put
and won't be moving to the new sports complex under construction in
Carson, to be completed by the Anschutz Entertainment Group by next
summer. The managers of both events were quite public in saying so.</TE>
<TE>   One official even said it on the court after the women's doubles
final at the Manhattan Country Club. The traveling road show will be
back next year.</TE>
<TE>   Does this mean the AEG courtship is over? No.</TE>
<TE>   Expect more negotiations, more countermoves, more proposals and
more lines in the sand. The WTA was not pleased with one headline
implying it wanted the women's tournament to stay at Manhattan Beach.
International Management Group, which owns and runs the tournament,
controls the location, not the WTA.</TE>
<TE>   The WTA is walking a fine line, not wanting to upset its new
partner AEG, which is staging the season-ending championships at
Staples Center in November, or IMG.</TE>
<TE>   At least Manhattan Beach does not have the problem UCLA will be
facing next year. This week's event at Washington, D.C., which
includes Andre Agassi and Andy Roddick, moves from August to July in
2003, and will be played the same week as the Los Angeles event.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually no one is pleased by this turn of events. Washington is
a party in an antitrust lawsuit against the ATP, and settlement talks
have been fruitless.</TE>
<TE>   Next year's head-to-head conflict will take away stars from both
events, particularly American players. Washington is run by SFX
Sports Group, which represents Roddick, Los Angeles finalist
Jan-Michael Gambill and winner Agassi.</TE>
<TE>   Perry Rogers, Agassi's longtime agent, said Monday that his client
will play Washington next year. Agassi is attempting this week to win
for the sixth time there.</TE>
<TE>   "Washington has been a good start to the summer season for Andre
even before they moved to the end of the summer," Rogers said. "It's
a good court. Andre likes the hot conditions. That's the plan. We're
hoping the lawsuit gets worked out. It's unfair to everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Even though the UCLA tournament lost the world's No. 1-ranked
player, Lleyton Hewitt of Australia, because of illness on the eve of
the event, there was not a huge drop-off in attendance, thanks to
Agassi's presence.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Rogers felt confident Agassi will return to this area--at
some point. "There's no way Andre has played his last match in L.A.,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi's star power puts people in the stands like no one else.
It's clear that diluted fields won't help television packages in
either the Washington or Los Angeles market.</TE>
<TE>   "No other sport would go out and do that," USA Network senior vice
president Gordon Beck said of the Washington-Los Angeles conflict.
"That is a perfect example of what this initiative is trying to
eliminate."</TE>
<TE>   "This initiative" is the new broadcast deal the cable network and
the United States Tennis Assn. announced Monday. As part of the
six-year extension of the network's domestic rights to the U.S. Open,
USA also will broadcast selected summer hard-court tournaments
leading up to the Open.</TE>
<TE>   Southland Report Card</TE>
<TE>   Best men's match: Agassi's quarterfinal victory over Gustavo
Kuerten of Brazil in three sets. Agassi put it best beforehand when
he said it was too bad they had to meet so early.</TE>
<TE>   Best women's performance: Venus Williams at Carlsbad, losing only
one set in winning her third straight title there, shifting the
pressure back to her younger sister Serena heading into the U.S.
Open.</TE>
<TE>   Best showing by someone not named Williams: At Manhattan Beach,
knee surgery survivor Chanda Rubin had the best tournament of her
career, knocking off No. 1-ranked Serena Williams (ending her
21-match winning streak), No. 5 Jelena Dokic in the semifinals and
defending champion Lindsay Davenport in a compelling final.</TE>
<TE>   Twilight zone moment: You might think it would be the time
violation called against Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia on match
point at Carlsbad, giving the victory to Ai Sugiyama, but that's not
even close.</TE>
<TE>   It was the semifinal at Manhattan Beach between Dokic and Rubin.
Dokic, who played impressively in the quarterfinals, looked like a
pale imitation of herself, losing, 6-0, 6-2, in 41 minutes. Rubin was
as stunned as anyone, saying Dokic went into "semi-tank mode."</TE>
<TE>   Dokic said she wasn't feeling well. But other sources said she
appeared to be disturbed by personal problems on the final weekend at
Manhattan Beach, one of them unfolding moments before the semifinal.
And that seems to be a more credible explanation.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC Coach Pete Carroll ran his team through the first day of training
camp Monday and came away impressed with his players' aggressiveness
and the tempo of their two workouts.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans were enthusiastic during a crisp 2 1/2-hour practice
in the morning and maintained their energy level during 2 hours 15
minutes of drills in the afternoon heat. It was the beginning of
three weeks of preparation for USC's Sept. 2 opener against Auburn at
the Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a fine first day," said Carroll, who begins his second
season with the Trojans. "We're off to a very good start."</LD>
<TE>   Carroll liked what he saw from quarterback Carson Palmer,
receivers Jason Mitchell and Mike Williams and offensive lineman
Jacob Rogers among others, but no one made a better impression than
offensive lineman Fred Matua.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Zach Wilson suffered a foot sprain during the morning
session, so Matua, a 6-foot-3, 305-pound freshman from Wilmington
Banning High, worked at guard with the first team for most of the day
and was not intimidated by the assignment.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't come here to sit behind anyone," Matua said. "I'm going
up against some great players and learning from some experienced
players. If you don't want to compete, you shouldn't be at USC."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said Matua's aggressiveness and quickness off the snap
made him stand out.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a lot to learn and I don't know where it's going to take
us right now, but he's made a great first impression," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior Marcell Allmond, attempting to move from receiver to
cornerback, made a leaping interception during a seven-on-seven drill
and moved well despite nursing a sore right calf and knee.</TE>
<TE>   Allmond injured his calf during a pre-training camp workout. He
injured his knee last week when he was hit by a car while crossing
the street near his campus apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "A lady turned right on a red light and didn't see me," Allmond
said. "I flew back into the curb and hit my knee on the ground, and
got some abrasions on my arm.</TE>
<TE>   "My right leg is real sore, but I'm making progress. It feels fine
when I'm running--it's just when I stop."</TE>
<TE>   Allmond is one of several contenders for a role. Despite missing
last season after being suspended from school for fighting with other
students, he is confident he is in the mix on defense.</TE>
<TE>   "The coaches say the starters are etched in sand," Allmond said.
"That says to me, there's opportunity to play."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans performed special teams drills Monday and will
practice game-situation field-goal attempts and conversion kicks
today.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we're kicking the ball particularly well right now
in any phase of it," Carroll said. "I didn't see anyone kicking the
ball just killing it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Billy Hart, a redshirt freshman expected to challenge
for a backup role, and junior offensive lineman Nate Steinbacher, ran
on the sidelines but did not participate in morning or afternoon
drills because they have not passed the team's conditioning test of
interval sprints. Both players are recovering from off-season
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Junior linebacker Chris Prosser and senior tight end Scott Huber
also did not take part in the morning workout, but passed the test in
the afternoon and participated in drills.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wilson suffered a foot sprain in the morning and was on crutches
later. He is expected to miss a few days.... Defensive tackle Bernard
Riley, who missed spring practice because of a knee injury, sat out
most of the afternoon workout while icing his knee. "It's going to
take some time," Carroll said. "He's not able to go twice a day right
now." ... Linebacker Matt Grootegoed, returning from a broken leg
suffered against California last Nov. 10, worked with the second
defensive group. "We wanted to make sure not to overwork him the

<DL></DL>
<LD>The regular season ends tonight, and what a season it has been.</LD>
<LD>   Lisa Leslie threw down the league's first dunk.</LD>
<LD>   Seattle and Washington posted their first winning seasons and
earned their first playoff berths.</LD>
<TE>   The league's talent level and competitive balance rose, thanks to
a strong rookie class.</TE>
<TE>   And because the talent is more evenly spread, some of the
regular-season awards are tough to figure.</TE>
<TE>   Only two of the awards, in this writer's opinion, should be
locks--the most valuable player and rookie of the year. Houston's
Sheryl Swoopes deserves to be the MVP, more so than Leslie,
Washington's Chamique Holdsclaw and Indiana's Tamika Catchings.</TE>
<TE>   Swoopes made a spectacular return after missing the 2001 season
because of a knee injury. She ranks first among players in minutes
played, is third in scoring average and third in steals.</TE>
<TE>   Even though a surprising loss to Sacramento on Saturday may keep
the Comets from being seeded No. 1 in the Western Conference, Swoopes
was at her best in the showdowns against Los Angeles. Houston won the
season series, 2-1, by winning both of the games on the Sparks'
floor. The first victory ended L.A.'s league-record 28-game home
winning streak. The second made Houston the first team to beat L.A.
twice at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie, the reigning MVP, will lead the WNBA in rebounds and
double-doubles. She became the first WNBA player to score 3,000
points, and won her third All-Star MVP award in four games.</TE>
<TE>   But she had, by her standards, an up-and-down season. Her
16.7-point scoring average is eighth in the league and second best on
the Sparks. With the Sparks having a more balanced offense, Leslie,
the focal point, was held under 15 points in 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   She was, at times, sapped by a virus that was never satisfactorily
explained. And she was double-and triple-teamed whenever she got the
ball. She still demands respect and attention.</TE>
<TE>   She just didn't have quite the impact this season that Swoopes
did.</TE>
<TE>   As for the top rookie, Catchings is the runaway choice. She also
came back this season, after missing last year with a knee injury,
and was not only the best rookie, she was one of the best players,
period.</TE>
<TE>   Catchings leads the league in points with 585, two more than
Swoopes. She is second to Leslie in total rebounds. Most impressive,
she got Indiana to the brink of the playoffs with much less talent
around her than Swoopes, Leslie or Seattle's Sue Bird, her closest
comparison in this season's rookie class.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All-WNBA Team</TE>
<TE>   Bird, who led the WNBA in assists, averaged 15.3 points and helped
Seattle make the playoffs, has changed my thinking in one regard.</TE>
<TE>   You can have two rookies on the All-WNBA first team. At least I
will on mine.</TE>
<TE>   I have Bird joining Swoopes, Leslie, Catchings and the Sparks'
Mwadi Mabika, who should be chosen as the league's most improved
player in a close vote over New York's Tamika Whitmore.</TE>
<TE>   My choices for the second team are Holdsclaw, Houston's Tina
Thompson, Seattle's Lauren Jackson, Utah's Marie Ferdinand and
Orlando's Shannon Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach of the Year</TE>
<TE>   Houston's Van Chancellor and the Sparks' Michael Cooper are
certainly worthy. But they ought to win with the talent they have,
and each has already won the award.</TE>
<TE>   I liked Marianne Stanley, and Holdsclaw for MVP, when Washington
jumped to a 15-6 start. But a late-season tailspin, coinciding with
Holdsclaw's injuries, cost Washington the regular-season Eastern
Conference championship and has kept the Mystics in a tight battle
with Charlotte for second.</TE>
<TE>   That brings it back to other teams making breakthroughs.</TE>
<TE>   Utah, which doesn't get much attention in the Western Conference
because of Houston and L.A., has set a franchise record for victories
and will finish with the league's third-best record. That speaks
strongly for Coach Candi Harvey. Nell Fortner should receive
consideration if Indiana squeaks in as the East's fourth playoff
team. But the Fever will do so with a .500 record.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, I lean toward Seattle's Lin Dunn, whose team also set
a franchise record for wins and made the playoffs for the first time.
It doesn't hurt that the Storm also beat the Sparks twice this year.</TE>

<DH>Gators, giant beetles, lethal mosquitoes, rats the size of
house pets - no wonder Saints feel swamped at Thibodaux, La.,
training camp</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>THIBODAUX, La.</DL>
<LD>A 13-foot alligator is on the loose. That should come as no surprise
to the New Orleans Saints, who have spent the last two summers living
with the realities of the NFL's most otherworldly training camp.</LD>
<LD>   This is the heart of the bayou, after all, where beetles the size
of cigarette lighters--locals call them, ''flying cockroaches''--buzz
around, and there is a $4 bounty on swamp-dwelling nutria rats, which
are as big as terriers and have burnt-orange teeth. The air is
impossibly steamy, especially after it rains, which happens roughly
once a day.</LD>
<LD>   Some teams spend their summers in comfy locales--the Raiders in
Napa, the Cowboys in the air-conditioned Alamodome, the Buccaneers at
Disney World. The Saints have chosen Nicholls State University here
in Thibodaux, about an hour's drive southwest of New Orleans.</LD>
<TE>   ''It's the worst camp in the league,'' said tackle Kyle Turley,
voicing a common sentiment among Saint players.</TE>
<TE>   The worst?</TE>
<TE>   Not for alligator hunters. Lake Bouef is boiling with gators, and
they're easy to spot. Just go there at night and scan the surface
with a flashlight. Their eyes glow a brilliant red. It's a favorite
hangout for Capt. Danny Kraemer, a Nicholls State campus policeman.</TE>
<TE>   ''When you shine a light, that lake looks like a Christmas tree,''
said Kraemer, when runs a zoological supply business on the side and,
at the moment, is on the trail of a 13-foot beauty.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Kraemer caught a smaller gator in a ditch just off
campus, bound it with duct tape and hoisted it into the bed of his
pickup truck. He then drove it to camp so players could get a
glimpse. Coach Jim Haslett nearly jumped out of his skin when someone
grabbed the back of his leg as he was leaning into the truck to take
a peek. He wasn't the only one spooked.</TE>
<TE>   "It was scary, man,'' defensive tackle Norman Hand said. ''I was
coming up to meetings and the next thing I know I see this eight-foot
gator. I'm wondering who the hell brought it on campus. [Kraemer]
wanted me to wrestle it, man. I'm a brave man, but I ain't that
brave.''</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Joe Horn is less concerned about the heat, rats and
gators than he is about mosquitoes that could carry the West Nile
virus. Each morning, around 5:30, a plane makes a few passes over the
practice field, spraying the area with pesticide. Mosquitoes have not
been a problem so far, but horn doesn't want to take any chances.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's like a state of emergency and we're still out here
practicing,'' he said. ''It's bad. I think more should be done about
it. You know when those tornadoes come through and tear up a
neighborhood, they call it a state of emergency and [President] Bush
comes in and helps them and all that? That's what should happen
here.''</TE>
<TE>   Hand isn't quite ready to declare Saint camp a disaster area, but
he has seen how the other half trains. He spent three seasons with
the Chargers, spending his summers in relative paradise.</TE>
<TE>   ''This ain't La Jolla,'' he said. ''I felt like passing out, the
first practice here. The humidity was brutal--it's still brutal--but
the thing is, it's getting us ready for the opening game against
Tampa Bay. I think the team that's in the best shape will win that
football game. I'll definitely take these conditions.''</TE>
<TE>   The old-time Saints used to practice in Thibodaux, back when the
bug zappers crackled so loudly that Archie Manning actually had
problems calling audibles. The team later moved its training camp to
Crosse, Wis., where it spent 11 summers before moving back to
Thibodaux in 2000. Holding camp in the bayou reportedly pumps $2.6
million a year into the local economy.</TE>
<TE>   According to documents obtained last year by The Times, the Saints
lost $849,000 in 1999, making them the only NFL team to finish the
year in the red. They have since signed a 10-year, $186.5-million
guaranteed revenue deal with the state that is said to ensure them
more than the league average in revenue. The move back to Thibodaux
was, in part, a good-will gesture by Saint owner Tom Benson, whose
team is in the final year of its deal with Nicholls State.</TE>
<TE>   At the urging of Haslett, the franchise has made the camp more
livable by paving the gravel path from the practice fields to the
locker room, and freshening up the facilities with new paint and
carpeting. The laundry rooms were upgraded too, meaning assistant
trainers no longer stumble around like zombies because they have been
up all night, cleaning uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is a good chance the Saints will leave Thibodaux
after this summer and move training camp to team headquarters in a
New Orleans suburb, where the team is building an indoor practice
facility scheduled for completion by January. Haslett's biggest gripe
about Thibodaux is that the team has nowhere to practice when it
rains. The only alternative now is to pile into a bus and drive to
the Superdome, where there are occasional scheduling conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   Team officials last summer even investigated practicing in a
sugar-cane warehouse in Thibodaux. But the place was too small, the
floor was uneven and the ceiling was too low to throw passes, let
alone punt. Regardless of the conditions, the Saints still draw fans
by the thousands. Nearly 10,000 people filled the stands earlier this
month, paying $12 a seat to watch the Black and Gold scrimmage, which
was basically a showcase for second- and third-string players. More
than an hour afterward, the stands were still loaded with people
because the players and coaches stayed around to sign autographs.
Turley, a local hero so popular he served as grand marshal of a Mardi
Gras parade, tossed T-shirts to the crowd and signed autographs until
his hand ached.</TE>
<TE>   The support of Saint fans, Turley says, is the only thing that
makes training camp tolerable. That and the gumbo from Bubba's II, a
restaurant-sports bar in town also famous for its boiled crawfish
soup and bacon-wrapped shrimp. The guy who owns the place, Doug
Swanner, is such a fan, he has been known to drive to road
games--even as far as Denver--with a truckload of jambalaya fixings.
When he gets there, he cooks for the players and coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how it would affect Thibodaux if the Saints left, Swanner
said, ''I don't think it would be devastating. It would hurt. But
this is a strong community.''</TE>
<TE>   Strong enough, in fact, to survive the population explosion of
nutria rats, which feast on swamp grass and are causing the ground to
erode at an alarming rate. Typically, the folks in Thibodaux look on
the bright side.</TE>
<TE>   Locals say those rats taste even better than chicken.</TE>
