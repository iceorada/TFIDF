<LD>Fresno</LD>
<LD>   She had lived long enough to bury her husband and bury her son and
watch the family's 40-acre vineyard, planted with grapes from the old
country, give way to housing tracts.</LD>
<LD>   Vera Gajarian had seen almost everything life had to show in her
92 years. Too much good had happened, she said, to dwell on the bad.
She was old and gnarled now and, like the vineyard, ready to go. One
thing, though, still tugged at her.</LD>
<TE>   As a child in what is now eastern Turkey, she had witnessed the
murder of her father and mother and four brothers and sisters in the
death marches of a forgotten genocide. She had waited decades for
Turkey to admit its guilt. She had waited for a reckoning that never
came.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Now, more than 85 years later, her history was being acknowledged
in a way she never imagined. As she sat in a movie theater a few days
ago, her grandson on one side and her granddaughter on the other,
images of the Armenian massacres flickered in her face. A new motion
picture, "Ararat," the major feature film about the genocide to make
the big screen, had come to her hometown.</TE>
<TE>   There was only one problem. Gajarian was 20 years blind. "My eyes
don't work so well, honey," she said, leaning in on her cane. "I will
hear what I can no longer see."</TE>
<TE>   As far back as the 1930s, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was set to make a
movie depicting the 1915-18 massacres that killed more than half the
Armenian people and drove the rest from their ancient homeland near
Mt. Ararat. But the Turkish government, refusing to admit to the
genocide, pressured the U.S. State Department. MGM killed the movie.</TE>
<TE>   There it languished until an Armenian Canadian director named Atom
Egoyan, whose brilliant but quirky work had earned him an Oscar
nomination, decided to fulfill a promise he had made to himself as a
kid.</TE>
<TE>   In the three weeks since its release, his $15-million movie has
received critical acclaim. But "Ararat" is no epic. Although Miramax
is billing it as "the movie they don't want you to see," the company
has released it in only a handful of big cities.</TE>
<TE>   Fresno, deemed too small and middlebrow, cried foul. Letters
asking "How can you leave out Fresno?" were sent to Miramax President
Harvey Weinstein. No city in America, after all, has been shaped more
by the survivors of the genocide. The refugees who arrived here by
the tens of thousands in the 1920s and '30s built the raisin industry
and became this valley's judges and poets.</TE>
<TE>   Like Vera Gajarian, most were too busy raising new families to
pass along any memories of the atrocities they left behind. Their
children often grew up without knowing the reasons why a silly
Armenian song, "Lie, Lie, All the World Is a Lie," would incite a mad
dance. Or why a simple pomegranate would be hoarded like a jewel.</TE>
<TE>   Now nearly all of those old-timers were gone. Only Gajarian and a
handful of survivors were left to see a film woven around the themes
of memory and denial. "I have met some Turks who are the nicest
people. I don't feel resentment," she said. "But for their government
not to admit this for how many years -- 80, 90? They can deny, but
I'm here to tell them that I saw it with my own eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Without pity</TE>
<TE>   A week before the film's premiere here, she sat in her ranch house
now ringed by suburbia and talked about the obligation to tell her
story. As one of the last living witnesses, she said she wanted to
tell it without pity or embellishment.</TE>
<TE>   Gajarian landed on Ellis Island on the Fourth of July, 1920. She
boarded the train to Fresno, where her uncle had a farm on the
outskirts of town. When it came time to attend church, she joined not
the Armenian parish, but the First Baptist Church of Clovis. She read
Twain and Steinbeck and Hemingway and every word of Upton Sinclair.</TE>
<TE>   But at night, when she took a deep breath, all she could smell was
the village of Keghi, its goats and grain fields, and all she could
taste was the flat cracker bread, the lahvosh, that came out warm and
sweet from her mother's clay oven.</TE>
<TE>   Keghi had been carved into the side of a mountain along a river.
The 2,500 Armenians lived in four neighborhoods, each with its own
church. Below, beside the small valley planted with wheat and
walnuts, lived 1,000 Turks.</TE>
<TE>   It was a strange give and take.</TE>
<TE>   The Armenians, who arrived 800 years before the Turks, were barred
from the Ottoman government. The Turks ran the jail, court and City
Hall. No Armenian could possess a firearm, but the town's shops and
banks were firmly in Armenian hands. The men, Turks and Armenians,
mingled in the central bazaar, where they threw back shots of
licorice-flavored moonshine and jousted in endless duels of
backgammon.</TE>
<TE>   "If there were any problems between the Armenians and Turks, I
didn't see it. I was just a little girl."</TE>
<TE>   Her father, Khoran, was a cobbler who owned a dry goods store. She
doesn't remember her mother, Alem, ever sitting. She had auburn hair
and fair skin and kept her slim figure even after five children.</TE>
<TE>   The oldest child, Vasken, 12, had polio and couldn't walk.
Gajarian was the third child, after Stella and before Harry. Then
came the baby boy, Onig. He had been born just two months before that
night her father walked through the door with terrible news: World
War I had edged closer. The Turkish soldiers said they needed to move
the Armenians to a safe area. A convoy was leaving in 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, they set out on foot as soldiers led the way on
horseback. It was late May 1915. Her father carried crippled Vasken,
her mother clutched little Onig. They walked day and night, through
mountains and high desert, heading south toward the Euphrates River.
She said the Turks stayed poker faced all the way to the town of
Palu, 75 miles into the deportation.</TE>
<TE>   "We were sitting down, finally resting, and on a hill there were
50 Armenian men tied together and marching. The next thing we heard
were gunshots. We knew then they were trying to get rid of the men."</TE>
<TE>   As they marched toward the city of Diyarbekir, she saw her father
talking to a friendly soldier. That night, her father handed the
coins from his belt to the soldier. He was going to rescue her father
and a few male friends.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember my dad leaving. He told us to be good and mind Mother
and always to pray. He said he would meet us soon in a safe area.
That's the last time I saw him. The next day, the soldier came back.
He was wearing my daddy's jacket."</TE>
<TE>   Diyarbekir had become an open pit of torture, rape and murder.
Historian Christopher Walker, in his 1980 book, "Armenia: Survival of
a Nation," wrote that 570,000 Armenians had been killed there in a
spasm of ethnic cleansing.</TE>
<TE>   So many dead Armenians were floating in the Euphrates that the
river had changed course. Vasken couldn't hold on to a cousin's
shoulders and was swept away. "Thank God, I didn't see him drowning."</TE>
<TE>   The family trudged on with no food or water in the desert sun. The
skin on baby Onig's face was burned. His tongue had turned charcoal.
He was already dead. Their mother just didn't know it. "He died in
her arms. She was so weak that she wrapped him in a blanket and
handed him to me and my sister Stella. 'Go bury him,' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, they were herded to a railway station, where
3-year old Harry died in Gajarian's lap. The soldiers packed the
remaining Armenians from Keghi -- fewer than 100 -- into railway
cars. They were headed to a concentration camp at the edge of the
Ottoman Empire. Before they arrived, her older sister Stella died of
starvation.</TE>
<TE>   At some point the soldiers at the camp disappeared, and she and
her mother were left to wander like beggars. She remembers being on
the second floor of a bombed-out hotel with four or five families.
Her mother was lying on the floor and Gajarian was trying to talk to
her, but Alem wasn't answering. "They sewed her up in a white sheet
like a mummy. The wagon came and two men picked her up and I followed
them to the stairway. When they got to the bottom, they just threw my
mother into the wagon. Like a block of wood."</TE>
<TE>   She said she was crying when she felt a hand on her shoulder. It
was her father's sister, Aunt Derouhi. She remembers the words like
it was yesterday.</TE>
<TE>   "Mother died. I've got no one."</TE>
<TE>   "I'll take care of you now," her aunt said.</TE>
<TE>   Derouhi was jarbig, resourceful. She took the leftover wool from a
shearing house and crocheted little girls' dresses that they sold to
the Arabs. It was those dresses that bought their train fare to
Constantinople. Her father's brother and his English wife had made it
to Fresno. She would set sail on an ocean liner and join them. She
would marry their son, her cousin Sarkis. They would have a child
named Stanley, who would become a fruit broker, like her husband.</TE>
<TE>   In Fresno, there were two rival Armenian churches, two competing
picnics to bless the grapes and two ceremonies to remember the
genocide. There was one cemetery, Ararat.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Gajarian's two grandchildren took her to see the movie
"Ararat." She was joined by a congressman, a state senator and
Fresno's mayor, Alan Autry, a B-movie actor. She listened to the
haunting flute made from the wood of the Armenian apricot tree. She
heard the gunshots, the cries of marchers and the word "genocide"
uttered without equivocation.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened to my people angers me, but I hold no bitterness
against the Turks," she said, leaving the theater. "We have our books
and finally we have our movie. I pray that the Armenians will now put
this away. What's done is done."</TE>

<KH>NEW YORK, N.Y. GERALDINE BAUM</KH>
<HD>A city balks at its big talkers</HD>

<LD>On the streets of New York, there have always been people talking to
themselves. But these days, it is as likely to be an investment
banker as a paranoid schizophrenic who's mumbling into his chin. Of
course, in every hamlet in every corner of Earth there are now men,
women and children yakking endlessly into their cell phones. But
because New Yorkers live so vividly, so compactly, on the streets,
the relentless cell phone culture is more noticeable here -- and
often more infuriating.</LD>
<LD>   About a year ago, New York banned hand-held phones in cars. And
city cops sporadically have gone on binges ticketing drivers
including my husband, 30,578 other one-handed drivers and me. City
politicians now want to ban cell phone conversations from "public
spaces" such as theaters, concert halls, buses and subways. Only the
mayor is against the ban, arguing that it is unenforceable. But in a
city known for its vigilante justice, this new legislation may save
as many lives as a great many of its citizens believe the car ban
has.</LD>
<TE>   A recent Harvard University study blamed cell phones for an
increasing number of highway deaths, now estimated at 2,600 a year.
It's not clear yet whether New York's ban is saving lives but it has
apparently cut by half the number of drivers whose attention isn't
fully on the road, according to a preliminary study by the city.
Still, most of the country -- including California, which has
aggressively put the screws to smokers -- is lagging behind New York.
But maybe it's the importunate nature of the crowds or the
unforgiving gridlock of the streets, the swallow-you-whole aspect of
the subways and the shove-and-ride culture of the buses that makes
this great, proud city ready for a new etiquette.</TE>
<TE>   Six rings of the same cell phone twice interrupted a classic
vocalist at Carnegie Hall recently. During intermission, a member of
the audience yelled, "TURN THAT THING OFF, YOU.... " The screamer got
as much applause as the singer did.</TE>
<TE>   A professor was concentrating on a crossword puzzle on a packed
bus when a businessman got into a full-blown conversation on his cell
phone. No dirty looks or loudly pained sighs could shut this guy up.
Finally, the professor stole a minute from 13 Across and bellowed,
"Louder, louder!" at the businessman.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, there was applause.</TE>
<TE>   From the Bowery to the Bronx, bus drivers are stopping midroute to
eject self-absorbed cell phoners, if only for their own protection.
Otherwise, who knows what might happen when a fed-up fellow passenger
snaps, unwilling to listen to a seatmate's latest gynecological
report as described on the M5 bus. Subways are quieter -- not a word
usually associated with this famously screechy system -- but that's
because cell signals don't penetrate below ground. However, a couple
of stations are now wired for peripatetic conversation, and there
have already been reports of trouble on those platforms.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Reed, the New York City Council member who proposed the
latest cell phone ban over the summer, says everywhere he goes he
meets grateful citizens with horror stories. It used to be possible
to have perfect privacy in public -- it was one of New York's charms
-- and his constituents want it back, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "In New York, we are used to living cheek to jowl," Reed says, "so
it's precious to people to be at a live performance and be able to
escape. I don't want to have to hear about someone else's personal
life on the phone." Reed is confident the mayor's objections to the
pending legislation won't prevail when it comes up for a vote by the
entire City Council this month: "It's difficult to enforce the
pooper-scooper law," Reed adds, "but what's the mayor going to do,
forget about that?"</TE>
<TE>   Still, when it comes to the voyeurs among us, the opportunity for
perpetual eavesdropping can offer a choice form of entertainment.
"Last week on the M7, I heard someone breaking up with her
boyfriend," a friend reports. "She even lied to him. Said she was
still at the office."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, New York's always been a 24/7 amphitheater. Couples make
out feverishly waiting for a light to change or have knockdown fights
that stop traffic. Tourists pose with mounted cops and bag ladies
alike; celebrities help us out of our taxis, politely waiting entry;
fans at ballgames are as much fun to watch as the players. We, the
so-called normal, bystanders and passersby, handle it all with
aplomb: steering clear, numbly acting always as if nothing is
happening.</TE>
<TE>   Poignantly, a Los Angeles colleague, who lived in New York in the
1980s, recalls how he used to love the way New Yorkers seemed so open
to each other on the streets, ready to strike up a friendly
conversation with strangers. Now when he returns, however, all he
sees "are walking zombies, making calls that are probably completely
unnecessary." His nostalgia probably has something do with the
California sun. We, who dwell in the shade of skyscrapers, know that
our fellow New Yorkers are accustomed to that paradoxical public
privacy. The animosity toward cell phone abusers represents an
unheard-of paradigm shift: Greta Garbo meets Donald Trump every day
on every patch of pavement.</TE>
<TE>   That said, it is unwise to lose your sense of humor in the city,
which brings me to my husband -- born and bred here, my favorite New
Yorker. He was nabbed last December, right after the law went into
effect, talking on his red, hand-held phone in our green station
wagon as he drove out of Central Park.</TE>
<TE>   For a brief period, if violators could prove they'd bought a
headset, they could elude the $100 fine. So I bought him one, and
mailed a copy of the receipt along with his ticket to the city's
traffic violations department. But I erroneously checked "not guilty"
on the ticket, and he was summoned to traffic court four months
later.</TE>
<TE>   "Law &amp; Order" it was not.</TE>
<TE>   The Harlem courtroom looked, he says, like a stadium restroom,
tiled and grimy. The judge seemed to take the attitude that fate had
kept her off the Supreme Court and condemned to adjudicating traffic
disputes. When it was finally my husband's turn at the bench, after a
bit of confusion the judge waived the fine. Unfortunately, he still
had to pay a $35 surcharge, New York state's cut of any activity in
the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   This brush with the law totally reformed the man, an astonishingly
lousy driver for someone so law abiding: "I am now on a crusade to
stop other offenders, like my wife." OK, I am the worse offender.
Although a superb driver, I tool around New York's boroughs like a
suburbanite, usually steering with my knee, holding the cell phone
with one hand and tapping at my Palm Pilot with the other.</TE>
<TE>   After a year of such arrogance, I was pulled over while reading my
next week's column on the cell phone to a friend in Washington, and
exiting the FDR Drive at 34th Street. A female officer beckoned to me
from the sidewalk with a terse wave of her hand. I did not weep or
beg or make up some excuse like I was calling a dying relative. No, I
waited stoically for the 15 minutes it took the officer to issue me a
ticket. Then I -- the typical Manhattanite who goes into phone rage
when I have to listen to someone describe the specials when I am on
line at Zabar's -- drove off. And immediately called back my friend
to finish reading her my story.</TE>

<HD>Sending a message for all seasons</HD>
<DH>The Gospel Divas show lifts the spirit and rocks the soul
in a roof-raising celebration of spirituality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lynell George</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a Christmas show billed as the "hottest" coming to L.A., the
Gospel Divas 2002 concert was oddly bereft of the familiar seasonal
trimmings. Save for the scarlet suit -- or three -- and a few fur
collars turned up against a Southern California chill, there was nary
a pine wreath, tinsel tree nor a dusted-off, light-up replica of the
wise men and Baby Jesus in the manger.</LD>
<LD>   But no matter, the 365-day message of how to stay the course was
there in full force. And maybe that was the point.</LD>
<LD>   Hosted by City of Refuge, the brand-spanking-new Gardena home of
Bishop Noel Jones' Greater Bethany Church, the event was a chance to
corral gospel music's premier preaching divas in one space over two
days.</LD>
<TE>   Friday night's program featured belters B.J. Stanton, Dorinda
Clarke-Cole, Shirley Caesar and Vickie Winans in a well-paced three
hours of party and praise.</TE>
<TE>   Though challenged by a sound system that was alternately muddy or
unevenly miked, the evening went off without a hitch and highlighted
a teeter-totter of styles, some of that old-time organ-blasting
religion balanced with a healthy shot of hip-hop bounce.</TE>
<TE>   Stanton kicked things off with a short, tight set of song and
sermon, promising that "Jesus Will Make a Way." But it was
Clark-Cole, backed by the synchronized 40-member Voices of Judah
Choir, who first dug into the heavy-duty preaching. Posing those
probing end-of-the-year questions, she declared, "Tonight, we're here
in God's waiting room where God is working some things out in your
favor. Question is: 'What do I do while I wait?' " Clark-Cole then
splashed the crowd with a sparkling version of "I'm Coming Out," a
number from her latest, self-titled album, losing her jewelry as she
traveled verse to verse.</TE>
<TE>   Backed by a powerful quartet, grande dame diva Caesar, glowing in
creamy white-and-gold brocade and modified goddess braids, handily
took the reins. Four decades in the business, Caesar knows how to
take command of a room with something as simple as a raised brow or
assured nod. "Armor of God," choreographed in a formation march,
Motown-style, was turned into an altar call, seeking eager enlistees.</TE>
<TE>   A generous Caesar passed the microphone around to any and all
"soldiers in the army of the Lord" who gathered at the rim of the
riser. Women in their work suits and mules, men in jeans and matching
denim jackets, some in stocking feet -- singing their praises in big,
rafter-blasting voices.</TE>
<TE>   "I may get older," said Caesar, "but the anointing stays the
same." No one would have any of it. Caesar's wise, deeply grooved
voice, her bright eyes and her steely command of the room show only
that age means power and focus, not weakness.</TE>
<TE>   So just how does one follow Caesar? If you're Vickie Winans, you
do it with sequins, sass and stand-up. Winans teased the crowd with a
performance that felt more like an after-hours routine than holy
ritual.</TE>
<TE>   "You know those people," cracked Winans, peering coquettishly over
her shoulder. "Oh, I'm too spiritual to laugh." She then admonished,
"Some of y'all ain't laughed since God was a boy!" But that didn't
mean she didn't work the message.</TE>
<TE>   Into her prickly one-liners she wove a series of personal
struggles that have beset her over the years -- the death of her
father, her mother's current bout with diabetes, a risky operation on
her vocal chords. She offset all of it with a collection of jubilant
music selections, showing off a survivor's voice on the
Caribbean-tinged "I Hear the Music in the Air" and one of those "good
old songs," "Long as I Got King Jesus."</TE>
<TE>   So maybe the evening wasn't all decked out in red and green and
you couldn't put it under the tree, but you can lay it all next to
your heart.</TE>

<KH>POP MUSIC REVIEW</KH>
<HD>They're in a growly mood</HD>
<DH>Bands make a lot of noise at the first night of Almost
Acoustic Christmas. But is it just a need for attention?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Hochman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Grrrrr. War is looming.</LD>
<LD>   Grrrrr. The economy is shaky.</LD>
<LD>   Grrrrr. Terrorists are lurking.</LD>
<TE>   Yes, there's plenty to grrrrr about these days, and there was a
whole lot of it at Night 1 of the annual Almost Acoustic Christmas
weekend shows sponsored by KROQ-FM (106.7) on Saturday at the
Universal Amphitheatre.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't look-at-the-world discontent. It was more the
look-at-me variety.</TE>
<TE>   Opening band Taproot grrrrred about poor self-esteem with guitars
bludgeoning away. Ditto for Trust Company. Pop-punkers New Found
Glory grrrrred the crowd for not being lively enough, and Sum-41
grrrrred about not conforming but lost credibility with its
choreographed frog-jump moves.</TE>
<TE>   And later, Disturbed singer David Draiman grrrrred with such
Mephistophelean chest-thumping as to be laughable.</TE>
<TE>   The grrrrr was noticeable for its absence, though, against the
thunderous riffs of Audioslave. That's because said riffs previously
belonged to Rage Against the Machine, a standard-setting band that
paired the powerful music of guitarist Tom Morello, bassist Tim
Commerford and drummer Brad Wilk with frontman Zack de la Rocha's
pointed, if haranguing, political science lectures.</TE>
<TE>   In Audioslave, De la Rocha is replaced with distinctly apolitical
Chris Cornell, formerly of Seattle titan Soundgarden. The quartet's
live debut (save for a "secret" Roxy show on Friday) almost entirely
followed the Rage blueprint in the music's crushing rhythms and
Morello's vast array of guitar effects. But the switch from De la
Rocha's hectoring to Cornell's keening resets the reference points
from hip-hop to Led Zeppelin.</TE>
<TE>   The key moment may have been nonmusical. At the end of its set,
the musicians exchanged warm hugs, relieved perhaps to have overcome
the tensions that had jeopardized the band's very existence before
its new debut album had even been completed.</TE>
<TE>   Grins and not grrrrrs also came from another '90s rock star
presenting a new project Saturday. Former Smashing Pumpkins leader
Billy Corgan unveiled his band Zwan, which offered a nicely sunny
view, combining '60s melodicism and outlook with the Pumpkins' '70s
and '80s arena-rock scale, with musical echoes of such icons as John
Lennon and Neil Young. However, after an inviting start, the set soon
lost focus and the music often seemed not-quite-cooked.</TE>
<TE>   Arguably, the two biggest winners of the night were Queens of the
Stone Age, still trying to break through big commercially after three
albums, and newcomer the Used. The former's mix of psychedelic metal
was by far the most imaginative, tightly executed and evolved of the
night. And the addition of former Screaming Trees singer Mark Lanegan
on several songs brought a Jim Morrison-esque mystique to the stage.</TE>
<TE>   Used singer Bert McCracken has more of a Charlie Manson look and
mystique going with his Utah quartet and yet seemed less affected
than most of the evening's singers. His charisma and the band's
balance of melody and dark power made this clearly an act to keep an
eye on.</TE>
<TE>   One has to wonder, though, how McCracken's ironically worn "Jesus
Is My Homeboy" shirt went down with closing act P.O.D., whose
Christian grounding gives it distinction in this scene. But there was
little else of distinction in its closing set Saturday. The music is
warmed-over Rage Against the Machine -- superfluous with Audioslave
on hand -- and the San Diego band resorts too often to heavy-handed
sloganeering, especially in its clunky anthem, "Youth of the Nation."</TE>
<TE>   Not to be lost amid all the teeth-gnashing and posturing this
night, though, was the real spirit of the season: selling. Every one
of these bands is underwritten by the music division of a
multinational corporation, and dutifully played its hits and did
nothing to challenge the status quo of KROQ, itself part of media
giant Viacom.</TE>
<TE>   Rage against the machine?</TE>
<TE>   This is the machine.</TE>

<HD>Safer movies, less moxie at New Line</HD>
<DH>The studio appears to be backing away from its brasher days
with its new lineup of remakes and sequels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Horn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alexander Payne is a final-cut director, which means that when he
showed New Line Cinema his new Jack Nicholson film, "About Schmidt,"
it was essentially the movie he wanted released. But rather than
defer to the Oscar-nominated "Election" filmmaker, New Line invoked a
rarely exercised contract clause that allowed the studio to enter the
editing room, re-cut the film and test its own version on an
audience.</LD>
<LD>   The studio excised Payne's opening sequence in which Nicholson's
insurance agent retires, and suggested the director give the
melancholy film an upbeat coda. New Line's cut didn't prove as
popular in research screenings as Payne's, and the version debuting
Friday is the director's. Yet the editing-room episode nevertheless
reinforced the message that a studio that recently made one of
Hollywood's most fearless deals is growing ever more cautious.</LD>
<TE>   Not long ago, New Line was a bastion of brashness. It released
Paul Thomas Anderson's three-hour "Magnolia," complete with a
blizzard of frogs falling from the heavens; David Fincher's
provocative "Seven," which concludes with Gwyneth Paltrow's
decapitated head in a box; and Tony Kaye's bleak neo-Nazi drama
"American History X." These days, the studio's slate reads more like
opening night at a drive-in film festival. Upcoming titles include a
remake of the vermin thriller "Willard," a prequel to "Dumb and
Dumber," a remake of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," a "Final
Destination" sequel and "Freddy vs. Jason," pitting the villain of "A
Nightmare on Elm Street" against the bad guy from "Friday the 13th."</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't like where we were going, making $80-million and
$90-million movies where our fingers were crossed. This company
couldn't survive making only those movies," says Bob Shaye, New
Line's founder and co-chairman. "We needed a program that mostly
dealt with lower-budget movies. We try to learn from experience. We
are not a cultural temple."</TE>
<TE>   Some directors and producers say the studio remains one of the
best places to work, but New Line has made it clear its priorities
have changed.</TE>
<TE>   "In a business so risky, [these remakes and sequels] are less
risky and more likely to pay off," says Toby Emmerich, New Line's
president of production. While that's probably accurate, what's
remarkable about New Line's wariness is that it comes just one year
after one of the brassiest and most successful gambles in modern show
business history: New Line's "The Lord of the Rings."</TE>
<TE>   It was an expensive, make-or-break deal no other studio wanted to
make, and in the weeks preceding last December's release of the first
"Lord of the Rings" film, New Line's future looked uncertain.
Although New Line had sold off foreign rights to "The Lord of the
Rings" to minimize its investment, the studio had been stung by a
number of flops and forced to lay off staff. With profits down, the
studio couldn't make any movie costing more than $50 million
(including "Austin Powers in Goldmember") without permission from AOL
Time Warner. Before "The Fellowship of the Ring" opened, top
executives at the parent company publicly ignored Peter Jackson's
bold adaptation of the J.R.R. Tolkien tale and instead exalted Warner
Bros.' less ambitious "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."</TE>
<TE>   A few senior New Line executives privately worried that if the
first "Lord of the Rings" film fizzled, New Line would be packed up
and folded into Warners. New Line didn't have to call the movers. The
first "Lord of the Rings" collected more than $860 million globally,
earned a leading 13 Oscar nominations and won four Academy Awards.
(The second installment, "The Two Towers," opens Dec. 18.)</TE>
<TE>   Flush with box-office momentum and a fresh lease on life, New Line
began to reinvent itself. But rather than build on the "Lord of the
Rings" success with an eclectic slate of filmmaker-driven stories,
the studio first focused on middlebrow franchises, with only a
smattering of sophisticated fare in the mix. In a way, New Line was
simply returning to its roots; before it became part of a global
entertainment conglomerate, New Line was one of Hollywood's top
independent studios, thanks mostly to B-movie blockbusters like "A
Nightmare on Elm Street" and "The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."</TE>
<TE>   As New Line became more successful, it flirted with more expensive
and much riskier fare, often with disasters like "Lost in Space,"
"The Long Kiss Goodnight," "Little Nicky" and "Town &amp; Country." Even
highly praised movies like "Magnolia" didn't make money, New Line
says, and the studio's "Unconditional Love," a Rupert Everett movie
that cost more than $40 million, turned out so poorly it is never
going to be released theatrically. As the first "Lord of the Rings"
movie was nearing completion, New Line began retrenching. The first
and most dramatic step was ousting production chief Mike De Luca, a
champion of both New Line's coolest movies but also some of its
biggest busts.</TE>
<TE>   "Our obligation is to operate in a profitable manner. Maybe we
were not cautious enough," says Michael Lynne, New Line's other
co-chairman. "But obviously, you can't make only franchise films.
That would be ludicrous."</TE>
<TE>   Damaged reputation</TE>
<TE>   Agents and producers who work with New Line -- and even some
people inside the studio -- say the studio's obsession with
franchises has damaged the studio's reputation. Because New Line
sells off foreign rights to its films, A-list actors and directors
who get a percentage of global gross profits tend to get a smaller
profit paycheck if they make New Line movies.</TE>
<TE>   Some talent relationships have been strained as well. New Line
handed director John Boorman ("Hope and Glory," "Deliverance") its
script for "Cellular," a thriller in which a college student has only
the battery time left on his mobile phone to save a kidnapped woman
who's calling him. Boorman, intrigued by the plot, started exchanging
story ideas with the studio about the film, thinking he was going to
get the job.</TE>
<TE>   Then New Line hired David Richard Ellis ("Final Destination 2") to
direct, stunning Boorman and infuriating his representatives at
International Creative Management, who briefly boycotted New Line.
Says Emmerich, who took over for De Luca nearly two years ago: "I
handled it poorly. I've learned a lot of lessons on the job. I just
didn't feel [Boorman] was going to be the best director for the
film."</TE>
<TE>   Emmerich says a number of films in the future, including a new
work from "Three Kings" director David O. Russell and an adaptation
of the David Eggers memoir "A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering
Genius," will prove that New Line's commitment to daring, top-flight
filmmaking remains intact. Next fall, Emmerich adds, New Line's
schedule includes "The Notebook," an adaptation of the Nicholas
Sparks novel; "Secondhand Lions," a Haley Joel Osment movie about an
eccentric family, and "Elf," with Will Ferrell in a "Santa
Clause"-style comedy. Several producers currently working on New Line
movies say Emmerich's background as both a writer (he did uncredited,
last-minute rewrites on "Rush Hour 2") and a longtime music executive
make working with the studio pleasant. "Creatively, I am having one
of the best experiences I've ever had," says Dean Devlin, the
producer of "Cellular" and "Independence Day."</TE>
<TE>   New Line has such strong relationships with some filmmakers, the
directors consider the studio family. When Brett Rat- ner's "Red
Dragon" opened in October, the "Rush Hour" director couldn't sleep
because he was "going out of my mind" worrying about the film's early
box-office returns. Rather than make a late-night call to Universal,
the studio releasing "Red Dragon," Ratner woke up Shaye at 1 a.m.
Shaye gave him the numbers. "That's why I love this guy," Ratner
says.</TE>
<TE>   Next trilogy on time?</TE>
<TE>   But New Line's string of blockbusters every Christmas could be in
jeopardy. After the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy concludes next
December, the studio had hoped to launch its next multipart literary
adaptation, a two- or three-part series based on novelist Philip
Pullman's "His Dark Materials" fantasy trilogy, in December 2004.</TE>
<TE>   But screenwriter Tom Stoppard is still working on the adaptation,
and complicated special effects mean the first movie probably will
not be ready until the summer of 2005, if not later.</TE>
<TE>   Payne says he didn't mind New Line re-editing his movie, and says
he was treated better at the studio than he was at Miramax ("Citizen
Ruth") or Paramount ("Election").</TE>
<TE>   "I would absolutely make another movie there. I have no
complaints," he says. "It was all done in a very friendly way. There
was no bullying. It's always the studio's duty to pull the filmmaker
in a commercial direction as much as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Every other studio, Payne says, would have tried to do the same
thing and soften "About Schmidt's" rough edges. Until recently,
though, New Line wasn't every other studio.</TE>

<LD>December brings not only Christmas but Christmas corn. That means
more of that beloved schmaltz, "It's a Wonderful Life."</LD>
<LD>   Frank Capra's 1946 movie stars Jimmy Stewart as a man who
sacrifices his hopes and dreams to serve others in Bedford Falls, the
"measly, crummy old town" he never leaves. It aired Saturday night on
NBC, and returns Dec. 24.</LD>
<LD>   I'm on the record as being dubious. As I've written, how could
George Bailey be having a wonderful life if he doesn't know it when
he lives it? Instead, the poor, miserable shlub has to be persuaded,
as he's about to leap from a bridge in a fit of depression at
Christmastime, by his leprechaun of a guardian angel, Clarence
Oddbody.</LD>
<TE>   What's to celebrate?</TE>
<TE>   I'm struck, though, how closely in some ways George's story
parallels "Extreme Makeover," Wednesday's ABC special that it says
"transforms the lives and destinies" of three people by changing how
they look.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, it's a wonderful nose.</TE>
<TE>   You're skeptical, naturally, believing George -- who seeks nothing
for himself while doing good deeds -- has little in common with
Stephanie Woodside, 24 ("wants a more slender stomach and thighs,
larger breasts and the bump removed from her nose"), Stacey Hoffman,
31 ("looking for a smaller nose, a larger chin and leaner cheeks")
and Luke Seewoster, 29 ("looking to remove the excess skin from his
stomach, and he wants a nose job").</TE>
<TE>   Although it's true that liposuction is highly spiritual, I doubt
"Extreme Makeover" will become a Christmas classic like Capra's
movie. And ABC's decision to delay it, after announcing it for last
month's ratings sweeps, suggests the network is no big fan of its own
show.</TE>
<TE>   Yet "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Extreme Makeover" are about
redemption. Both also advance darkness-before-dawn scenarios that
assault your heartstrings until they're all plucked out.</TE>
<TE>   Take George, who is so down on himself that he would have hit the
water pronto if not for intervention from the heavens. He hates his
ordinariness and wants to transcend who he thinks he is.</TE>
<TE>   So do Stephanie, Stacey and Luke, it appears. It's clear, at
least, they are repelled by their looks and regard themselves as odd
bodies. As do the multitudes who asked the show for makeovers but
(for reasons unexplained) did not make the cut.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my lips are too small from the top," one reject said
Wednesday. "I want a body tuck, basically," said another. "I'd like
to have happy boobs instead of the kind that go down to the ground,"
added another.</TE>
<TE>   Boobs, happy or droopy, are not poor George's concern when he's
about to dive through hard-falling snow into the drink so that his
family can collect on his life insurance. Bad plan. Wouldn't the
insurance company be suspicious?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm worth more dead than alive," George mutters through his
despair. Bummer.</TE>
<TE>   "Now look, you mustn't talk like that," replies kindly Clarence
(Henry Travers), who has just beamed down and proceeds to use his
heavenly powers to show how shabby Bedford Falls and its citizens
would be if not for George. That includes his wife, Mary (Donna
Reed), who we learn would have been a prim, plain, timid,
bespectacled "old maid" -- and a prime candidate for an ABC makeover
herself -- if George had not come along to rescue her from
spinsterhood.</TE>
<TE>   George's troubles are ultimately eclipsed by the crescendoing
euphoria that accompanies all miracles, and the rest is history.</TE>
<TE>   Just as he is set straight by Clarence, so do Stacey, Stephanie
and Luke have a guardian angel in ABC, represented here by makeover
mavens Dr. Garth Fisher (plastic surgery), Dr. William Dorfman
(teeth), Dr. Robert Maloney (eyes), Michael Thurmond (fitness),
Brenda Cooper (wardrobe) and Jose Eber (hair). The show gives you a
peep at their procedures.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm never going to look the same again," says Stephanie, whose
esteem appears low.</TE>
<TE>   "Nice hair, nice hair," Eber reassures her. Well, he is her
Clarence.</TE>
<TE>   There's something else shared by "It's a Wonderful Life" and
"Extreme Makeover," by the way.</TE>
<TE>   Villainy.</TE>
<TE>   The movie is a parable whose scoundrel is old man Potter (Lionel
Barrymore), a greedy mogul whose evil scheme to gobble up Bedford
Falls includes destroying George and his family's struggling
savings-and-loan company on which the town has long depended. An act
of cruel thievery by Potter is what pushes George over the edge and
prompts a visit from Clarence.</TE>
<TE>   "Extreme Makeover" is driven by another kind of villain: a
prevailing attitude, perpetuated by much of the media, that places a
premium on physical beauty and facile solutions.</TE>
<TE>   We've become a quick-fix society, from term limits on elected
officeholders to beauty and health. Arriving via e-mail the other
day, for example, was an ad promising reduced body fat, increased
sexual performance, wrinkle and cellulite removal, lower blood
pressure, improved sleep, improved vision and memory, restored hair
color and growth, a strengthened immune system, increased energy and
cardiac output and a rewinding of the body's biological clock.</TE>
<TE>   All from a single product.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, "Extreme Makeover" offers its own one-stop panacea.
Although their looks are flawed, Stephanie, Stacey and Luke are
hardly Quasimodos when they arrive in L.A. for the redos they hope
will change their lives. And we hear that Tracy's "heartfelt desire
to attract the man of her dreams" earned her this opportunity to
acquire great looks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to the new me," she says, as if elective
surgery and all the rest will guarantee a life as flawless as her new
face.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the quest to become a perfect "10" may not coincide with
mental health, and the kind of plastic surgery performed here may not
repair a severely deflated ego, leading to frustration and
disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   Well, it's just another cockamamie TV show passing itself off as
"reality." I feel the same about "Extreme Makeover" as I do about
George Bailey's story. By the time the hour ends, I'm the one ready
to jump from a bridge.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, it's a wonderful lipo.</TE>

<HD>A 'Nutcracker' fortunate to make dreams come true</HD>
<DH>Not much distinguishes Kevin McKenzie's version of the
holiday fantasy. But American Ballet Theatre stars take it as a
chance to shine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lewis Segal</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The mechanical balloon on the proscenium is temporarily grounded. The
airbags that inflate to become flowers have a mind of their own. By
mistake, Child-Mouse #11 turns on Child-Mouse #10's cue, and it keeps
snowing in the parlor.</LD>
<LD>   No matter. Despite such glitches -- and the company's delayed,
storm-tossed arrival -- the dancers of American Ballet Theatre have
enough skill and spirit to make Kevin McKenzie's familiar,
undistinguished "Nutcracker" full of memorable moments at the Kodak
Theatre in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   The first three performances of the engagement brought no new
insights to a hectic, confused version that wants to combine facets
of everyone else's "Nutcracker" -- to have a grown-up dancer play
little Clara yet also present another dancer as the Sugar Plum Fairy,
for example, and to offer the simplified, traditional story line as
well as glints of a more complex narrative that existed when the
production premiered nine years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, as designed by Paul Kelly, the production has no magic.
The Christmas tree never really grows -- it's simply hauled up to
reveal a larger tree behind it -- and the dancers playing the
Nutcracker nearly get decapitated when their masks are yanked off in
what's supposed to be a transformation scene. But who cares for long
when so many talented artists get a chance to shine -- when Stella
Abrera, for instance, decides that the choreographic platitudes of
the Snow Queen represent a golden opportunity and delivers dancing of
spectacular speed and flair?</TE>
<TE>   However, nobody in the Friday opening cast or two Saturday lineups
generated more electricity than Joaquin de Luz as the Nutcracker and
Paloma Herrera as the Sugar Plum Fairy. De Luz has a smile that could
serve as a beacon to another galaxy. He's obviously decided that he's
the star of the evening and makes you believe it with dancing of
great assurance and charm.</TE>
<TE>   Sascha Radetsky and Gennadi Saveliev get through the grueling
partnering chores of the role more smoothly but remain curiously
deferential -- never daring, alas, to steal the show.</TE>
<TE>   As for Herrera, with that radically tapered waist she impressively
renews the currency of the term "hourglass figure" in the ballet
world but ultimately dazzles you with her flashing feet -- feet that
seem to have been born on pointe and that strike sparks whenever they
graze the floor. Marcelo Gomes partners her capably but never seems
to admire her as much as we do -- and that's a fault.</TE>
<TE>   Maxim Belotserkovsky, on the other hand, obviously adores his
Sugar Plum, Irina Dvorovenko (they're a husband-and-wife team). And,
without compromising their remarkable elegance, their sense of
connection warms their steps and reminds us that even a formal pas de
deux depicts an emotional relationship.</TE>
<TE>   New to this challenge, the majestic Michele Wiles and the noble
David Hallberg display their admirable training and musicality
without making the duet their own as yet. However, Wiles dances the
Snow Queen with exactly the same attack, so there's a question of
whether her concept of classicism extends beyond executing the steps
as beautifully as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Of the Claras, Erica Cornejo proves ideally wide-eyed and lyrical,
while Maria Riccetto goes for a spunkier, more forceful portrayal.
Sandra Brown, however, looks miscast: too mature to be convincing
alongside the real, locally recruited children in the party scene.
She appears to much better effect when slinking through the gymnastic
Arabian duet with Isaac Stappas.</TE>
<TE>   Victor Barbee, Guillaume Graffin and Ethan Brown each bring a
different personality and style to the role of Drosselmeyer without
resolving the narrative questions of the McKenzie version. (For
starters, is the ballet Drosselmeyer's dream or Clara's?) Full of
needless cuts that include the "Flutes" and "Mother Ginger"
divertissements as well as the end of the grand pas adagio, the
Ballet Theatre edition of Tchaikovsky's score is played by the
Pacific Symphony conducted alternately by David LaMarche and Charles
Barker.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Clarita Children's Chorus performs the snow vocalise
sweetly, and listening to this passage with your eyes closed gives
you a far more focused "Nutcracker" experience than watching the
restless, scattered corps effects that McKenzie imposes on stage.</TE>

<HD>Opera for eyes first, ears second</HD>
<DH>Baz Luhrmann's 'La Boheme' is a tale told with wit,
stagecraft and chutzpah, but musically it's underpowered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Swed</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>"La Boheme" has come to Broadway with all the fanfare of a hot show.
"La Boheme" is, of course, Puccini's beloved opera and the source of
inspiration for another hit show, "Rent." But that is not why
audiences will likely throng to it at the Broadway Theatre. Baz
Luhrmann is why. "La Boheme" was also an inspiration for his visually
brash musical film, "Moulin Rouge!"</LD>
<LD>   Those besotted by the Baz pizazz, the nonstop showmanship and
eye-popping exuberance, get their 17 exuberant minutes. Act 2, the
Cafe Momus scene, is a spectacular delight, a kind of
Disneyland-with-prostitutes vision of Paris in the 1950s that seems
to burst off the stage.</LD>
<LD>   Opera lovers needn't fear. Luhrmann hasn't gone too far. A young,
handsome cast sings the opera in Italian as written. The
amplification is far subtler than the miserable Broadway norm and
almost pleasurable. To compensate for singing that is not of a
particularly high standard -- though, for the most part, OK -- there
is a sense of intimacy and detailed bits of characterization that are
hard to equal in a large opera house.</LD>
<TE>   Nor do those intimidated by opera have much to fear. Luhrmann
desperately wants to entertain you. This "Boheme" is a tale well
told, full of wit, unabashed sentiment and buoyant stagecraft, that
goes by surprisingly quickly and is surprisingly painless.</TE>
<TE>   But it is also surprisingly flat -- an opera production that
begins, and pretty much ends, with stagecraft. Music comes second.
And the flat moments are the big ones, including the opera's
beginning and ending and most of its climaxes.</TE>
<TE>   Luhrmann's starting point is exciting theatrical chutzpah. At
every moment, he reminds us that theater is artificial. The complex,
many-faceted sets, by Catherine Martin, Luhrmann's wife and usual
collaborator, are full of realistic details that also mock realism.
Stagehands remain on stage throughout the performance, wheeling the
sets this way and that.</TE>
<TE>   English titles are used and they are emphatically self-conscious.
Since the opera is updated from the 1890s to Paris in 1957, Puccini's
bohemians become French hipsters. Martin and her costume co-designer,
Angus Strathie, dress them in what appear to be their vivid fantasy
of a '50s Paris look -- a sexy tight suit for Musetta, a yellow car
coat for Schaunard, a pink beret for Mimi. And Luhrmann has had the
original text translated into a not very convincing Americanized
jargon and beamed on as many as four different screens at once, often
in cartoony typefaces. "Hey, daddy-o," is the musician Schaunard's
greeting.</TE>
<TE>   Yet through all this advertisement of the artificial, the show is
expected to be so completely involving that we lose ourselves in it
anyway. When that works, it feels like magic.</TE>
<TE>   But visual fantasy cannot do that for very long. A serious and, I
think, fatal compromise is in relying on a puny orchestra of 28.
Although opera-goers don't always realize it, they get to know and
love "Boheme's" memorable starving artists, get caught up in the
tempestuous affair of Rodolfo and Mimi, because Puccini brings the
scenes to life and reveals the characters' inner lives most
effectively through his orchestra. Here, thanks to a tinny theater
pit band, trivial new orchestrations and cursory conducting by
Constantine Kitsopoulos, the central emotive force in Puccini's opera
barely even finds its way onto the spectator's radar screen.</TE>
<TE>   An important letdown, for instance, is the popular love duet
between the poet Rodolfo and the neighbor he has just met, Mimi.
Luhrmann creates a visual revelation of pure romance. There they are
on the roof of Rodolfo's garret, under the production's trademark red
"L'Amour" sign; Paris, gorgeous in the moonlight, lies under them.
Their passion swells to the ecstasy of first love.</TE>
<TE>   In one of Puccini's most inspired moments, he drenches the scene
with an orchestral climax, played with full emotion. It lasts only a
few seconds, but it carries that ecstasy to every seat in the house.
But here it becomes anticlimax when that moment has so little
orchestral weight, making what looks like grand romance feel more
like a coy bar pickup.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the minimal orchestra outburst as Rodolfo discovers
Mimi's death turns "Boheme's" famously wrenching moment into a
perfunctory ending.</TE>
<TE>   There are three casts for Rodolfo and Mimi -- and two for Musetta
-- because these roles are too demanding to be sung eight times a
week. For the cast I saw, neither the light-voiced tenor Alfred Boe
nor the more dramatic soprano Wei Huang demonstrated much vocal
personality, or even much stage chemistry, good though they looked.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the only characters that really came to life were Daniel
Okulitch's cocky Schaunard and Jessica Comeau's spunky, funny,
lascivious Musetta. As the painter Marcello, Ben Davis sounded
slightly strained. As the philosopher Colline, Daniel Webb seemed as
though the strain of nightly preview performances had already taken
its toll on his voice. The demands of Broadway may not do these young
singers good if the show has a long run. The small parts are all
nicely handled by character actors.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen years ago Luhrmann staged "La Boheme" for the Australian
Opera. It was a far more modest version of the new production, but
also one with young, handsome singers.</TE>
<TE>   Recently issued on DVD, it makes a successful video -- lively,
romantic, moving, hip. All the added neon eye candy that Broadway can
afford is mostly empty calories.</TE>
<TE>   Still a Broadway "La Boheme" is not necessarily a bad thing. It
just might entice new audiences enthralled by it into the opera
house, ready to be emotionally blown away.</TE>

<LD>Throbbing Gristle fans can spend a day with the notorious British
industrial-rock outfit starting Tuesday. That's the release date for
"24 Hours of TG," a mammoth, 24-CD boxed set, each disc holding one
of the group's hourlong, eardrum-shattering, noise-drenched
performances recorded from 1976 to 1980.</LD>
<LD>   Interested collectors better jump: Only 1,000 copies, selling for
roughly $230 each, will be available via the Mute Records Web site,
www.mute.com/tg.</LD>
<LD>   Hold the phone ....</LD>
<TE>   It's understandable why RCA Records put out the $425 "Elvis
Presley Collection" 30-CD boxed set three years ago, and why Reprise
Records issued the $500 "Frank Sinatra: The Complete Studio
Recordings" 20-disc box seven years back.</TE>
<TE>   But Throbbing Gristle, a group that's never touched the Billboard
charts?</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that it boggles your mind is good," says Pete Howard,
publisher of ICE, a monthly magazine for record collectors. "That
means it will appeal to the completist -- those music collectors who
have to have everything an artist releases. They're the ones who will
make these things turn a profit."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the Presley and Sinatra boxes, which have sold about 1,000
and 10,000 copies at retail, respectively, a 17-CD Dwight Yoakam set
is due early next year from Rhino Handmade, the Rhino Records custom
division.</TE>
<TE>   The Yoakam set had been targeted for release this fall, but that
date was pushed back because all the elements, from music to souvenir
guitar picks to shreds of Yoakam's jeans, weren't in place in time.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, it just takes longer to get it right," says David
Dorn, Rhino's vice president of media relations, new media and
promotion. "Ultimately, what we want to do is do it right.... We have
found at Rhino, being in the [reissue] business for 24 years, that
there is a very healthy collector community out there. And they have
not shriveled up just because a lot of box sets have appeared."</TE>
<TE>   In the last decade, numerous boxed sets have gone well above and
beyond the standard three- and four-CD retrospectives, with packages
containing 10 or more discs. The subjects of the all-stops-out
approach range from the obvious (a 16-CD Beatles set covering all of
the Fab Four's studio albums and singles, and a 12-CD set culling
nearly 300 vintage sides by pioneering country group the Carter
Family) to cult bands (a 13-CD Blur box and a 12-CD set on British
progressive rock group Marillion).</TE>
<TE>   "There's a huge number of artists who are big enough for people to
flock to these things," ICE's Howard says. "There is a certain
novelty aspect that will wear off, but I don't think we're anywhere
near that yet. It's actually kind of fun and exciting to think what
might still be coming down the pike."</TE>

<HD>A brave and wrenching new fictional world</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Merle Rubin</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eva Hoffman, who came to America as a 13-year-old in 1958, has made a
name for herself writing thoughtful nonfiction books about subjects
linked to her Polish and Jewish heritages. In "Exit Into History,"
she described revisiting Poland and other Eastern European countries
after communism's fall, and in "Shtetl," she painted a portrait of
life in a vanished Jewish village. Her memoir "Lost in Translation"
powerfully evoked her adolescent experience of suddenly being unable
to communicate in her native language while struggling to gain her
bearings in a new one.</LD>
<LD>   And now in "The Secret," Hoffman's first work of fiction, she
offers us a heroine with an identity crisis of quite a different
kind. Iris Surrey is good-looking, blond, brimming with health,
vitality and intelligence. Although she is the only child of a single
mother, it's hardly unusual to grow up in a single-parent household
(Iris is born in 2005).</LD>
<LD>   Her mother, Elizabeth, is well-to-do and just as attractive,
blond, healthy and intelligent as Iris. Mother and daughter get on
well. Almost too well. Iris sometimes senses a kind of "weirdness."
Digging through her mother's files, Iris uncovers the secret within
the first quarter of this novel, and it shouldn't spoil the reader's
suspense too much to reveal what has been heavily hinted at from the
story's outset: Iris has no biological father. She is her mother's
clone.</LD>
<TE>   What kind of woman would want to produce a daughter who was an
exact genetic replica of herself? Elizabeth Surrey is a golden girl,
a self-confident, selfish super-achiever who soars to the top of the
heap in the investment game, then suddenly feels a lack.</TE>
<TE>   Reciprocal relationships not being Elizabeth's forte, she decides
to go the cloning route. (In the story the procedure has only
recently begun to be available to the public, but Elizabeth is
nothing if not cutting edge.) Iris is stunned and appalled to learn
the truth. Realizing she is her mother's clone makes her doubt the
reality of her own existence. She feels she is nothing but the "copy"
of her mother's "original."</TE>
<TE>   Unable to bear being with her mother, she rushes off to New York,
where she hopes to find her mother's parents and sister, estranged
all these years by Elizabeth's headstrong and highly questionable
choice.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman painstakingly chronicles her protagonist's struggle to
regain her sense of selfhood and humanity, although Iris finds no
easy answers to her predicament: "I'll always veer between the
suspicion that I'm a highly impressive piece of organic programming
and the wrenching hope that within my identikit frame there beats
something like a true human heart, and that this heart is also a
psyche, a soul, a spirit."</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman uses Iris and her clone-hood as a means of discussing the
mind-body question. But the mind-body problem would probably be no
more of a problem for a clone than for a traditional twin or for any
other human being. Any person might feel troubled by the thought that
he or she is only a collection of cells, which have to some extent
been pre-programmed by a genetic code.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble (not Iris', but the novel's) is that the psychological
and metaphysical problems that face Iris would be more suitable for a
creation like Hal the computer in "2001: A Space Odyssey." Iris,
after all, is not a robot but her mother's twin. Although identical
twins often have relationships different from that of ordinary
siblings, one seldom hears of a twin complaining like Iris about a
lack of soul -- a lack of individuality, perhaps, but not of soul.
Besides, even identical twins experience some differentiation by
having different experiences. Surely, twins who were mother and
daughter rather than sisters would experience much more of a
different environment by virtue of being cast into different roles
and living in different generations.</TE>
<TE>   Which is not to deny Hoffman's central point: that cloning is a
potentially dangerous development and that someone in Iris' position
might well suffer from serious problems. Hoffman also provides some
wise and humane answers to her heroine's anguished existential
questions: The pains, losses, joys and sorrows we all experience, our
capacity for sympathy, grief, love and regret, are what make us into
souls.</TE>
<TE>   Still, one can't help feeling these are the right answers to
questions that have not been properly framed by this particular
story. Hoffman does not treat what in all likelihood would actually
be the serious consequences of cloning, which are not metaphysical or
even psychological, but social, cultural and ecological. Iris, we are
told, is not the only clone in this brave new world, merely one of
the earliest. What would it be like to live in a world where untold
numbers of identical beings could be produced? Would sexual
reproduction become an anomaly, a thing of the past? Would the clones
congregate in tribes and war with one another?</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, one of the most prescient novels ever written about
these matters was published in 1932: Aldous Huxley's "Brave New
World." Only in our present moment, without the guiding hand of a
centralized state to impose rationality and order on the process, a
nation of clones created by nothing more than the vagaries of
marketplace might make the well-oiled, pacified "Brave New World"
look like a nice place to live.</TE>

<HD>A price out of this world</HD>
<DH>Manhattan's World Bar makes an elaborate show of offering a
cocktail for $50.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan</AU>
<BD>Baltimore Sun</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It's Friday night at the World Bar, a swanky lounge in the new Trump
World Tower, and two waiters in spiffy cream jackets are headed our
way bearing a large silver tray.</LD>
<LD>   With grand flourishes, one waiter introduces himself and proceeds
to hold up each bottle and announce its contents before pouring tiny
amounts into the silver cocktail shaker. After mixing the Remy XO and
Pineau des Charentes with ingredients such as freshly pressed grape
juice, he gently pours the frothy concoction into a slender flute and
tops it off with Veuve Clicquot champagne and a touch of 23-karat
edible liquid gold.</LD>
<LD>   The performance is so impressive we feel compelled to applaud. But
what's most impressive about the drink is its price -- a
mind-boggling $50.</LD>
<TE>   It's named "the World's Most Expensive Cocktail" and boasts
ingredients rare in most bar drinks. The fruity aperitif Pineau des
Charentes, for example, is not found on most bar menus. Remy XO is a
complex, pricey cognac that is aged for up to 35 years. And World Bar
owner Mark Grossich was audacious enough to toss these in a drink and
slap on a price that, with tax and a 20% tip, will put you out just
over $64.</TE>
<TE>   Grossich says the price simply is in keeping with the bar's locale
-- the ground floor of the Trump World Tower, whose $12-million to
$17-million apartments reportedly have been sold to celebs ranging
from Bill Gates to Derek Jeter. And it is reflective of a bar that he
hopes will draw people as famous and wealthy as the tower's
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "We're located in the world's most expensive residential tower,"
Grossich says. "We felt that we should have the world's most
expensive cocktail."</TE>
<TE>   Grossich says the drink is worth the price, because its
ingredients are costly. A 750-milliliter bottle of Remy XO, for
example, sells for $109 at the Wine Underground in Baltimore. Veuve
Clicquot typically costs $38.99 a bottle, and a 750-milliliter bottle
of Pineau des Charentes retails for $15.49. For competitive reasons,
Grossich declines to divulge the exact amounts of each used in the
drink. But he emphasizes the full experience of buying "the World's
Most Expensive Cocktail" and points to wealthy celebs who have tried
it, such as Donald Trump's model girlfriend, Melania Knauss.</TE>
<TE>   "It's both refreshing and full-bodied," says Grossich, who adds
that the bar has sold several each week since it opened last month.
"People are just very curious about it. And for $50, you get a floor
show."</TE>
<TE>   Although pricey, Grossich's drink may not actually live up to its
name. Robert Plotkin, a national beverage consultant and author of
such books as "Successful Beverage Management," says that in the
spring, the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess resort in Arizona began
offering a $57 margarita made with Herradura Seleccion Suprema
tequila, priced at $55 for a 1-ounce drink.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Rinehart, the resort's director of restaurants, says most
guests have preferred to drink the tequila on its own so they can
appreciate its unadulterated flavor.</TE>
<TE>   He adds that many have not been surprised at the margarita's
price, partly because diners today are more educated about wine and
spirits than before.</TE>
<TE>   "Things like Food Network have really changed people's approach to
dining," he says. "People are a lot more careful about where they
spend their money, but they are absolutely willing to pay for what
they perceive to be quality."</TE>
<TE>   Even if Grossich's invention isn't the world's most expensive
cocktail, its price is several times higher than the cost of the
average U.S. bar drink, around $8 or $9.</TE>
<TE>   At most bars, Plotkin says, a cocktail's ingredients make up about
18% to 20% of its price. Without knowing the exact amounts in the
World Bar cocktail, he estimated the cost of ingredients to be no
more than $10. And, although the other cocktails at the World Bar are
$12 to $12.50, which is not unusual for Manhattan, Plotkin wondered
if "the World's Most Expensive Cocktail" price might be a deterrent
for some.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a downside to this marketing approach," he says. "Some
people would see this as a place that only snobs could possibly
afford, that 'times are tough and thanks for flaunting a reminder of
what I don't have.' "</TE>
<TE>   Even so, some like the idea of a $50 drink.</TE>
<TE>   Christine Gray, whose husband, James, is managing director of an
investment bank, ordered the drink on a whim during her first visit
to the World Bar. They both enjoyed the drink -- especially the
novelty of sipping gold -- so much they say they absolutely will have
it again.</TE>
<TE>   "In New York," James Gray says, "you don't think of expense."</TE>

<HD>A holiday experiment by Anonymous 4</HD>

<AU>Richard S. Ginell</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was hard to say who was being put to the test more at UCLA's
Schoenberg Hall on Saturday night -- Anonymous 4, or their fans.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than remain on their comfortable, usually soothing Middle
Ages turf, the four female singers leaped forward several centuries
-- yes, even into the 20th and 21st -- in a Christmas program titled
"Wolcum Yule."</LD>
<LD>   Clearly a lot of thought went into the carefully conceived,
symmetrical organization of material. Expertly accompanied by Alyssa
Reit on a small Celtic harp on most numbers, the Anons divided the
first half into four sequences in which each collection of
traditional carols from the British Isles was topped off by a
contemporary composition.</LD>
<TE>   Within the sequences were subdivisions -- harp interludes, solo
features for each singer -- and recurring subjects (parts of the
Scottish poem "Balulalow" were heard in no less than three settings
throughout the evening). Of the newer material, the most startling
departure from the Anonymous norm was Peter Maxwell Davies' "A
Calendar of Kings," full of jarring, clashing harmonies and a haunted
tone that set off some murmuring in the audience afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the most lasting impression of the program was left by
the endlessly inventive Benjamin Britten, whose exquisite "A New Year
Carol" ended the first half and provided a foretaste of "A Ceremony
of Carols" -- itself based upon medieval texts -- after intermission.</TE>
<TE>   Though Britten wrote "Ceremony" with a boys' choir in mind,
Anonymous 4 offered a less-innocent-sounding yet viable alternative,
with sometimes swiftly paced, surprisingly impassioned results.</TE>

<HD>Aristocrat? Maybe, but blue isn't her only blood type</HD>
<DH>Frances Sternhagen is known for her snooty roles. But in
'Morning's at Seven,' she gets to show a different side.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Haithman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a notable "Sex and the City" episode, actress Frances Sternhagen,
72, portraying upper-crust matriarch Bunny MacDougal, drops by with a
basket of fresh muffins for her pampered son, Trey (Kyle MacLachlan),
and his demure wife, Charlotte (series regular Kristin Davis).</LD>
<LD>   Bunny finds the pair not quite ready for breakfast -- instead,
very enthusiastically in the middle of the sex act. Shocked nearly
out of her perky hair ribbon and three strands of pearls, Bunny
stammers and flees from the room, never to make another uninvited
entrance into the apartment -- ousted in TV's first "sexorcism." The
performance netted Sternhagen an Emmy nomination for the 2001-02 TV
season.</LD>
<LD>   "She has a sort of East Side mental breakdown when she finds
them," says an appreciative Michael Patrick King, executive producer
of the racy HBO comedy series. "It's my favorite scene. It's the same
episode where she sneaks into Trey's bedroom at night when he has a
cold and rubs Vicks VapoRub on his chest, then Charlotte wakes up and
they are both rubbing VapoRub on this guy's chest. It's about
territorialism, the son being the territory. It is both sick and
erotic, and Franny was up for it."</LD>
<TE>   When asked about her recurring role on "Sex and the City,"
Sternhagen -- a member of the ensemble cast of "Morning's at Seven,"
which opens Wednesday at the Ahmanson Theatre -- offers a
characteristic facial gesture, a quick smile accompanied by a
deliberate scrunching of her sparkling blue eyes and a girlish
wrinkle of her patrician nose. On Bunny, the expression seems oddly
threatening; on Sternhagen, it's a good-natured tease.</TE>
<TE>   "I must say it's fun to play these snobby older ladies. It's
always more fun to be obnoxious," says Sternhagen, who portrayed a
similarly frosty blueblood, Millicent Carter, on "ER." "I have known
women like that, and I can imitate them, I guess."</TE>
<TE>   Of the sexual frankness of the HBO series, she offers, with the
trademark scrunch-and-wrinkle: "It's certainly ... different. But it
would never last if it wasn't cleverly written. It's believable and
funny, and it's very well played."</TE>
<TE>   Producer King describes Sternhagen -- Franny -- as the
well-adjusted opposite of the deliciously dysfunctional Bunny or, for
that matter, another of her well-known TV personae, Esther Clavin,
the even more bizarrely domineering mother of John Ratzenberger's
Cliff Clavin on "Cheers."</TE>
<TE>   So does Daniel Sullivan, Sternhagen's director in "Morning's at
Seven," the Lincoln Center production of Paul Osborn's 1938 play. The
cast also includes Paul Dooley, Elizabeth Franz, Julie Hagerty, Buck
Henry, Piper Laurie, William Biff McGuire, Stephen Tobolowsky and
Mary Louise Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   "She has backbone; it's not as though she is just docilely going
ahead and doing anything you want her to do," Sullivan says. "Franny
is very definite, a true pro, but her sort of sweet nature certainly
is true in her working relationships." The Broadway production was
nominated for nine Tonys, including three for featured actress for
Sternhagen, Franz and Estelle Parsons, who portrayed three of four
elderly sisters in the play (Parsons' role will be played by Wilson
in Los Angeles). Laurie was not nominated, leading the others to
humbly propose that the Tonys create a category called an "ensemble
award" instead of singling out anyone within the group. The issue
became moot when the award went to Katie Finneran for "Noises Off."</TE>
<TE>   Despite a reputation for being grounded enough to offer to forgo a
Tony, Sternhagen once again finds herself in the realm of neurotic
family relationships in "Morning's at Seven."</TE>
<TE>   Sternhagen -- herself the mother of six, including four actors --
plays mom to yet another aging momma's boy in "Morning's"-- this time
in the role of the dimwitted Ida, a small-town Midwesterner watching
with bemusement as her 40-year-old son, Homer (Tobolowsky), struggles
to break family ties that might better be described as handcuffs in
order to finally marry his sweetheart, Myrtle, 39 (Hagerty). They've
been engaged for seven years.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview during rehearsals for the Ahmanson production,
Sternhagen points out that in her long career she has played many
roles that fall well below the upper crust. That list includes a
recent role as the mother of a policewoman in "The Laramie Project"
for HBO, an adaptation of Moises Kaufman's off-Broadway play about
the hate-crime murder of gay college student Matthew Shepard in
Laramie, Wyo.</TE>
<TE>   But the Vassar College graduate acknowledges that somehow it's the
patrician image that sticks in people's minds. The homespun Ida
character, she says, gives her the opportunity to play against type.
Sternhagen cites a poem about the four sisters, quoted in the play: "
'Esty's smartest / Arry's wildest / Ida's slowest / Cora's mildest.'
That's a pretty good clue."</TE>
<TE>   "When we began casting, we sort of started with Franny and
basically asked her which role she wanted to play, and she chose
Ida," director Sullivan says. "I think probably Ida was a role that
was a bit of a stretch for Franny. Ida is the dimmest of the bunch,
in terms of intellectual capacity, and Franny's so smart and sharp, I
think she thought it would be fun."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Sternhagen observes, most of the characters in "Morning's"
would be rushed to the nearest psychiatrist, but in this pre-WWII
era, "the psychology is not spelled out, it just is," she says. "The
problems are not something to go to a therapist about, they just live
with them."</TE>
<TE>   Although she is a veteran of the theater, with Tonys for "The
Heiress" and "The Good Doctor," Sternhagen admits she's most likely
to be recognized from her TV roles -- sort of. The actress says the
exposure causes people to approach her thinking that they know her
from somewhere, they just can't remember where. They're as likely to
think she's a local librarian or a salesclerk at the dry cleaner's as
a star of film, TV and stage.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Sternhagen confesses to being an actress "depends on how I
am asked, how politely and sincerely," she says. "If they are polite,
I'll say, well, I've done some acting, maybe that's how you know me.</TE>
<TE>   "And if they are kind of a little rude," she adds primly, with an
emphatic scrunch-and-wrinkle, "I'll just say, no, I don't think you
know me."</TE>

<HD>Making the familiar seem new</HD>
<DH>The wry James Moody's improvisations infuse fresh, engaging
qualities into some standards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ageless bundle of musical inventiveness and outrageous humor
named James Moody just keeps rolling along. On Saturday he brought
his irrepressible presence to Clancy's Crab Shack in Glendale -- a
warm and homey room that is quickly emerging as an important weekend
jazz destination.</LD>
<LD>   Working with the stellar accompaniment of pianist Bill Cunliffe,
bassist Tony Dumas and drummer Ralph Penland, the veteran
saxophonist-flutist displayed his remarkable ability to mine new,
engaging musical riches from the familiar lode of pop and jazz
standards. Moody's soloing in tunes such as "Green Dolphin Street,"
"I Can't Get Started," "Wave" and "St. Thomas" was delivered in the
vocabulary of bebop, but the messages were all original, expressions
of an improvisational mind constantly exploring new, fascinating
passages through familiar chordal harmonies.</LD>
<LD>   His playing was a reminder of the fact that the jazz repertoire --
like the classical -- is constantly examined, reexamined and
invigorated by new interpretations. At 77, Moody continues to explore
that repertoire with inventiveness and imagination. His companions,
all from younger generations, added their own perspectives to the
material. Cunliffe's love of bebop was apparent in his every phrase;
Penland was his usual combination of musical subtlety and rhythmic
drive; and Dumas played a series of melodically engaging choruses.</LD>
<TE>   No Moody set would be complete without a healthy serving of his
inimitable, off-the-wall wit. And so, he tossed in a few random jokes
between tunes and concluded with his hilariously bawdy version of
"Pennies From Heaven" -- retitled "Benny's From Heaven."</TE>

<LD>So, with the holidays bearing down on us and the gift-giving season
in full swing, a question arises for some households: Is this the
year to treat the family to a high-definition television?</LD>
<LD>   It's a question many fear to ask without first getting the answer
to a more basic question: If I spend a sum north of four figures for
a high-def TV, what will I be able to watch?</LD>
<LD>   The answer: almost twice as much fare as was available last year
at this time.</LD>
<TE>   The push toward universal digital telecasting has been an
often-confusing one for consumers. The issue reached a degree of
finality in the summer when the Federal Communications Commission
mandated that nearly all new televisions be equipped with digital
tuners by 2007.</TE>
<TE>   Opinions vary as to whether now is a good time to purchase a
high-definition set, but a few things are clear. Costs have come down
considerably in recent years and will probably continue to do so. And
if a customer does spring for a set, there will be something to
watch.</TE>
<TE>   Among the major networks, ABC makes all of its scripted prime-time
comedies and dramas available in HDTV, except for reruns of "Monk"
and the new series "Dinotopia," which has technical complexities that
prevent it from being presented in high def.</TE>
<TE>   CBS airs its entire comedy and drama lineup in high-definition,
along with one daytime serial, "The Young and the Restless." NBC
offers much of its prime-time roster in high-definition as well as
"The Tonight Show With Jay Leno."</TE>
<TE>   And an increasing number of high-profile sports events soon will
be carried in high definition.</TE>
<TE>   Potential consumers, whether walking into an audio-video specialty
shop or the TV section of a department store, can't help being
impressed by high-definition television. Then comes the technical
stuff.</TE>
<TE>   The picture is far better than most people are used to, and so is
the sound. The image is in a 16:9 ratio of width to height, similar
to the way most feature films are displayed and more closely matching
the way we see the world with our eyes. The ratio on a conventional
set is 4:3.</TE>
<TE>   All high definition is digital, but not all digital is high
definition. HDTV refers to the highest quality level of digital
transmission, a distinction to keep in mind while shopping.</TE>
<TE>   Some sets are sold with built-in tuners that can receive
high-definition signals and display them on the set's HD monitor.
These are referred to as "integrated sets." Others consist of
HD-capable monitors that require the addition of an external tuner to
decode the high-definition signals and pass them to the monitor. This
type of set is called HD-ready.</TE>
<TE>   If all of this has been on your mind lately, you are not alone.
Sales of high-def televisions this year are projected to surpass 2
million, up from about 1.4 million last year.</TE>

<TE>   The best present or gift I've ever had was a small black dog. My
grandmother gave it to me. I received it around mid-June. This dog
was a terrier mix. It was a 4-month-old puppy. The dog had a

<HD>Trick Pony steps up the pace with its sassy, maverick
talent</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Lewis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's easy to see how hard-rocking country trio Trick Pony won the
Academy of Country Music's best new artist award this year. From a
visual and performance viewpoint, the group is energetic enough to
rise above the crowded field of would-be stars.</LD>
<LD>   Qualities that have captured the attention of the public and the
music industry were evident Thursday at the House of Blues Anaheim,
where Trick Pony exhibited maverick sensibility and its relentless
eagerness to please.</LD>
<LD>   Only sporadically, though, does the group tap into songs equal to
its onstage zeal. "Pour Me," the first single from last year's debut
album, is one such song, a honky-tonk boogie that explodes with sassy
attitude and bright wordplay. And on the new "On a Mission" album,
Keith Burns, Ira Dean and Heidi Newfield impress often enough with
their songwriting to sustain hopes that they'll one day transcend the
vestiges of bar-band razzle-dazzle that led to a contract and the ACM
award.</LD>
<TE>   The danger is that the threesome's stage personas -- Newfield is
the sexy wildcat, Burns the hunky cowboy and Dean the country Kid
Rock -- could turn into self-parody. Along with bits of too-slick
choreography, Trick Pony's cartoonish tendencies sometimes undermine
its real potential.</TE>

<HD>All aboard the good ship Belmont</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AL MARTINEZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Welcome to the SS Belmont. We will momentarily be boarding the
grandest ship ever to plow the ocean waters, a $200-million,
state-of-the-art vessel years in the planning and now at last a
reality.</LD>
<LD>   I'm here dockside on behalf of the Los Angeles Unified Ship
District to spend a few minutes reminding you of the Belmont's
amenities. As a vessel for young people, it's equipped with rooms
able to withstand music played at decibels equal to a thousand
leaf-blowers, pizza parlors on each deck, a riot room to simulate
post-game celebrations and beer bars that will open as soon as we
clear the 12-mile limit.</LD>
<LD>   The Belmont was designed by the firm of Ruben &amp; Zacharias and is
without a doubt the world's safest ship. Unlike the Titanic
[laughter] there are plenty of lifeboats, each decorated in designer
tones, and life jackets equipped with individual cell phones for our
talkie teens! The ship's Southwest pink facade and faux brick
interiors make it the loveliest ... I'm sorry, I have a message
coming in from the bridge. [Listening on headset, then:]</LD>
<TE>   Ladies and gentlemen, Capt. Roy Romer has asked me to announce
that teensy-weensy leaks in the fuel tanks will delay the start of
our voyage somewhat. Meanwhile, you are all asked to enjoy the free
beer and pizza as I continue telling you about this wonderful,
high-tech ... I'm sorry, I have another.... [Listening.]</TE>
<TE>   That was Capt. Romer again, asking me to pass on the good news
that the leaks have been plugged with a new quick-set substance
composed of bubble gum and French fries. [Laughter.] What will our
scientists come up with next?! And, oh, the captain has also asked me
to explain that the slight list to starboard is perfectly normal and
no cause for concern. It seems the builders misunderstood that fake
bricks were to be used in the health spa, causing more weight on the
starboard side than anticipated. Nothing to fret about, gang!</TE>
<TE>   [Listening.]</TE>
<TE>   Well, folks, another slight delay here. The cap.... What was the
question? The young lady at the edge of the crowd? Yes, it does seem
to be listing a little more, but it's my understanding that the
mortar in the brick is just, er, compacting, which causes a little
more weight as it dries. [Chuckling] If it ain't one thing it's
another!</TE>
<TE>   Anyhoo, it seems those newfangled bubblefry plugs aren't totally
stopping the leaks, and itsy-bitsy wisps of stinky old oil-based
gases are seeping into some of the compartments. For you parents out
there, not to worry. Those sections are being sealed off and fans are
being installed in the remaining rooms to blow away any wandering
fumes.</TE>
<TE>   To answer the lady's question over there, absolutely nothing will
explode, catch fire or prevent the crew from working in the engine
room. And I repeat once more, the ship is not sinking! It is, as the
captain reported, settling. New ships with bricks aboard often have a
tendency to settle or, as they say, to list. Eventually the other
side will also settle and it will all be evenly low and comfortable
in the water.</TE>
<TE>   [Listening.]</TE>
<TE>   However, for those worrywarts in the audience, we are going to
reduce the crew by 75% to lighten the load and prevent this wonderful
state-of-the-art ship from sink- ... I mean settling any further. No,
that will not interfere with the service or the safety of the
Belmont. That I can promise!</TE>
<TE>   [Listening, then sighing.]</TE>
<TE>   As you know, we're always checking this and checking that, and
last-minute testing has revealed certain, well, unintended openings
in some of the ceilings, notably over the main sleeping quarters, the
dining areas, the recreation areas and the medical services room.</TE>
<TE>   But, hey, not to worry! You remember those cool yellow slickers in
"The Perfect Storm"? Each of you will be issued one without any
additional charge! So go for it, guys! [Laughter.] Pray for rain!
You'll all be swaggering about in those slickers looking like
fishermen bringing in ...</TE>
<TE>   [Listening.]</TE>
<TE>   Well, folks, Capt. Romer has just been informed by the builders
that the Belmont, one of the prettiest ships afloat, is, well
[chuckling], unable to stand the pounding of certain waves. [Pause.]
Actually, all waves. It seems the designers erroneously believed the
Belmont was intended to be a restaurant or maybe a school complex,
not a ship. Waves might actually, you know, punch little holes in it
and let in water? You with me? So as a safety precaution ...
[Listening.]</TE>
<TE>   Ladies and gentlemen, it seems the ship is, er, settling to an
unacceptable degree and Capt. Romer has abandoned the bridge and you
are all advised to RUN BEFORE IT TAKES THE WHOLE DOCK WITH IT! But
don't let this discourage you from taking future trips. The L.A.
Unified Ship District is standing by!</TE>

<HD>Tiny guitar-making company is now a player in rock circles</HD>
<DH>Joe Naylor has made a name for himself with the retro
instruments he's been building near Detroit since 1996.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alexandra R. Moses</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WARREN, Mich</DL>
<LD>WARREN, Mich. -- A shiny blue guitar with a palm tree pattern rests
on a work table, waiting for its neck and strings.</LD>
<LD>   All around the brightly lighted room sit guitar bodies in
different stages of completion, propped against walls or strewn on
tables below cubicle-like dividers with hanging tools.</LD>
<LD>   It could be a high school shop class.</LD>
<TE>   But artists ranging from Kid Rock to former Smashing Pumpkins
leader Billy Corgan swear by these electric guitars. They are on a
long list of major and minor players who use Joe Naylor's
instruments.</TE>
<TE>   "It does have that 'X' factor that all guitarists are looking for.
I can't exactly put my finger on it," says Nashville blues guitarist
"Big Mike" Griffin. "It's just a cool guitar with a fantastic tone."</TE>
<TE>   Naylor is the founder of Reverend Musical Instruments, a four-room
shop tucked in an industrial park near a freeway in this city
bordering Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   The 41-year-old Ann Arbor native started the business in 1996
after a partnership manufacturing amplifiers ended. It's now a
six-person operation, custom-making guitars, basses and amplifiers.
Naylor figures they produce 100 guitars a month.</TE>
<TE>   The guitars, which range in price from $679 to $1,000, look like
relics from the 1950s and '60s, with modern touches. They're
influenced by classic cars, Naylor says. "They have a very Detroit
look in that respect."</TE>
<TE>   Reverend guitars are semi-hollow, producing an acoustic quality
even when they are plugged in. Naylor describes the sound as lively,
consistent and responsive, "like a high-performance sports car."</TE>
<TE>   The body starts with a plastic rim, a 6-inch white mahogany wood
block, and two pieces of phenolic laminate -- like Formica -- that
form the front and back of the guitar. The surface is shiny and
metallic, shaded in whatever color the customer chooses, from sky
blue to "aged" yellow to fireball red. Custom options include racing
stripes, flames and a Hawaiian theme with palm trees.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Sands, bassist for the Christian band Jars of Clay, says he
uses his Reverend Rumblefish bass in live performances and studio
sessions.</TE>
<TE>   "It cuts through while still providing a solid, consistent low
end. The last thing I want to add to the instrumental mix ... is a
bunch of mud," Sands says.</TE>
<TE>   As a guitar nut, Naylor was a late bloomer. He started playing and
repairing the instruments as a student at Western Michigan
University. After graduating with a degree in industrial design, he
spent five months at the Roberto-Venn School of Luthiery in Phoenix
to learn how to craft guitars.</TE>
<TE>   It would be a few years before he started Reverend, first doing
repair, then manufacturing amps.</TE>
<TE>   "I was always mechanical. I was always good with my hands," he
says. "I played with a lot of Legos, things to build model airplanes,
you know, and I was a bicycle mechanic and I was rebuilding toys
since I was a little kid. I'd modify my Hot Wheels."</TE>
<TE>   Even the music he plays on his guitar at home is his own.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like other people's stuff," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The switch to guitar-making wasn't hard, he says, because he
already had established a reputation among musicians while in the amp
business.</TE>
<TE>   Naylor describes his customers as professional, semiprofessional
and former professionals. It isn't a guitar for beginners, he says.</TE>
<TE>   The instruments are custom-ordered, initialed and carry
handwritten serial numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted it to have more of a personal, handmade touch to it,"
Naylor says.</TE>
<TE>   Willie Moseley, a writer for Vintage Guitar magazine, likens the
interest in Naylor's modern-retro-style guitar to the interest in
cars such as the new Ford Thunderbird and the Chrysler PT Cruiser,
which tip their hats to old-school designs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a definitive example of the cliche about how 'the only
difference in men and boys is the price of their toys,' "Moseley
says.</TE>
<TE>   Naylor won't reveal how much money the business makes, simply
saying cash flow is good. And he says he isn't in it for the money.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like a perfect combination of technology and art," he
says. "And it's the most important instrument of the 20th century,
and I like to be a part of that."</TE>

<HD>'The Guys' will make an Oscar qualifying run</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lynn Smith</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the one-act stage play "The Guys" opened in New York, about
three months after the collapse of the World Trade Center, actors
Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver played the emotionally wrenching
roles of a fire captain and the journalist who helped him write
eulogies for eight of his men who died on Sept. 11. Since then, the
play has received critical acclaim on both coasts. The two lead
characters have been portrayed by Anthony LaPaglia, Susan Sarandon,
Tim Robbins and Swoosie Kurtz among others.</LD>
<LD>   Now, with an eye to the Oscars, Focus Features is about to release
"The Guys" the movie--with Weaver and LaPaglia starring as the two
leads. The movie will run for one week at the Grove in Los Angeles to
qualify for the Academy Awards, then open for limited release in New
York and Los Angeles on Feb. 14, followed by a nationwide release.</LD>
<LD>   When the film premiered in September at the Toronto Film Festival,
critics praised Weaver ("Alien") and LaPaglia ("Lantana" and the TV
crime series "Without a Trace") as well as Jim Simpson, Weaver's
husband, who directed the original play and made his feature film
debut as the director.</LD>
<TE>   The play was based on the real-life experience of journalism
professor Anne Nelson, who was asked to help a fire captain write
eulogies for colleagues killed in the disaster. Simpson, artistic
director of lower Manhattan's Flea Theater, commissioned her to write
the one-act play.</TE>

<LD>With only two weeks left for Christmas shopping, Americans may have
been too distracted to go to the movies over the weekend. "Analyze
That," the only new wide-release movie, failed to lift box office
earnings out of the traditional post-Thanksgiving slump.</LD>
<LD>   Box office estimates fell roughly 50% from last weekend's
Friday-through-Sunday totals and 20% from the comparable weekend last
year, according to box office tracking firm Nielsen EDI Inc. "This is
typical after the Thanksgiving holiday," Nielsen EDI's Dan Marks
said. "People are back to work, they are doing their shopping and
have other attractions to go to."</LD>
<LD>   Some smaller films, however, posted impressive opening numbers.
Sony's "Adaptation," which stars Nicolas Cage, Meryl Streep and Chris
Cooper, grossed an average of $57,143 per theater for a total of
about $400,000 in seven locations. In addition, the Arenas
Entertainment/Universal film "Empire" came in at No. 4, grossing a
surprising $6.3 million, averaging a healthy $7,235 per theater in
867 sites.</LD>
<TE>   The film, which stars John Leguizamo, was aggressively marketed to
Latino audiences in a $10-million Spanish- and English-language
campaign. Essentially a genre film about gangster life in New York
City, the movie appealed mostly to a young Latino male audience. The
demographic breakdown was 51% Latino and 55% males over the age of
25, executives said.</TE>
<TE>   The movie's performance demonstrates that the Latino audience can
be reached with a well-orchestrated marketing campaign, said Santiago
Pozo, head of Arenas Entertainment, which bought the film at the
Sundance Film Festival last year for only $650,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Adaptation" also benefited from a specialized marketing campaign,
as well as excellent reviews and a marquee cast for the film that
re-teamed "Being John Malkovich" director Spike Jonze and
screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, whom the National Board of Review last
week honored for his scripts for the current film, the upcoming
"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" and last summer's "Human Nature."</TE>
<TE>   Because "Adaptation's" unconventional theme about a screenwriter's
difficulty in translating a book into a movie was a challenge to
compress into sound bites and movie and TV trailers, it took Sony
marketing executives years to fine-tune the campaign. The trailer
alone took a year to complete.</TE>
<TE>   As for "Analyze That," the sequel to the March 1999 surprise hit
brought in only an estimated $11.3 million for an anemic $3,884 per
theater in 2,635 locations. Starring Robert De Niro and Billy
Crystal, the estimated $60-million-plus movie may well have suffered
from what studio executives called "sequelitis," failing to get good
reviews or attract a significant audience. The original enjoyed an
opening of $18.4 million during a slow spring weekend on its way to a
total of $106.8 million, but "That" is highly unlikely to get as far.</TE>
<TE>   MGM's "Die Another Day" returned to No. 1 in its third weekend,
grossing an estimated $13 million, down 58% from the prior frame, for
a cumulative total of $120.3 million. "Harry Potter and the Chamber
of Secrets" was down 69%, coming in at No. 3 with an estimated $10
million for a total of $213.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's "TreasurePlanet" continues its steep slide, grossing only
$5.7 million, down 53% from its lackluster opening weekend. The film
cost an estimated $150 million to make and is a major money loser for
the studio. Disney's "The Santa Clause 2," meanwhile, grossed an
estimated $5.4 million, down 55%, for a total of $120 million.</TE>
<TE>   Revolution Studios' "Maid in Manhattan" packed auditoriums in
previews in 875 theaters. The Jennifer Lopez-Ralph Fiennes movie
opens Friday.</TE>

<LD>"Sarah Bylar, you're the most unusual person I've ever met," Chelsea
Hewlitt said to me. She leaned over the low fence that separated her
home from our farm while I hung the wash on the clothesline.</LD>
<LD>   "You don't have lights or anything electric in your house, your
folks don't drive a car and you don't go to movies. You don't even
watch TV. How can you live like that?"</LD>
<LD>   I was beginning to ask myself the same question. Until I met
Chelsea, I was perfectly happy with my life in Honey Lane, Ohio.
We're Amish, and we believe in simple ways.</LD>
<TE>   "Nothing of the world," I'd heard Mama and Papa say many times. So
we all wear clothes that pretty much look alike, we don't use
electricity and when we go anywhere it's in a buggy pulled by a
horse. And, like Chelsea said, no movies or TV.</TE>
<TE>   Our ways often seem strange and backward to non-Amish, "the
English," Papa calls them, but he says we have a lot less to worry
about. And that suited me fine.</TE>
<TE>   Then, a few months ago, English developers built the Honey Lane
Inn on the property next to our farm, and Chelsea's family moved here
from California to run it. That's when she began telling me how much
fun all these other things, especially television, are.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow," Chelsea said now, "my mom couldn't get along without the
clothes dryer or the microwave. And it must take ages to get anywhere
in those buggies. And why is your clothesline in the frontyard? And
what's with those funny caps you wear?" The questions never stopped.</TE>
<TE>   All the things she was asking about made me wonder, for the first
time, about the way I lived, but I didn't have any answers for either
of us.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: Will Chelsea's questions change Sarah's plain and simple
ways?</TE>

<HD>'WinTuition' and 'Lingo' put some originality into network</HD>
<DH>The two Game Show Network programs reflect the brave new
cable world.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid all the Emmys, critical accolades and ratings breakthroughs for
shows such as "The Sopranos" and "Six Feet Under," it's easy to
forget that once upon a time HBO was merely a niche cable experiment
eking out a precarious existence in the long shadow of the broadcast
networks.</LD>
<LD>   But now with even onetime cable afterthoughts such as FX striking
original-series gold with "The Shield," everyone wants to get into
the act. And that includes the Game Show Network.</LD>
<LD>   Yeah, you can still see all the "classic" reruns of chestnuts such
as "Family Feud" and "Match Game," but beginning tonight at 5:30 you
can also see a couple of fun original shows that are part of this
same emboldened attitude of the non-network world.</LD>
<TE>   A new gamer, the goofily entertaining "WinTuition," kicks off the
hour by giving three contestants a chance to win $50,000 toward their
higher education (in an oddball gimmick, the prize money is paid into
an IRS 520 Plan that allows the winner to draw out the money for
educational expenses). It's a general-knowledge format that spices up
the action with curlicues such as impromptu pizza deliveries and
Letterman-esque recurring characters. Marc Summers ("Double Dare")
hosts, and Henry Winkler is among the executive producers.</TE>
<TE>   Following at 6 is "Lingo," the network's top-rated show back for
its second season. Hosted by "Love Connection" main man Chuck
Woolery, this is a word-guessing game that blends elements of "Wheel
of Fortune" and bingo. The vibe is a bit more staid than
"WinTuition," but the game, pairing teams of two against each other
for $5,000 and travel packages, is pretty addicting.</TE>
<TE>   The "Lingo" concept originated in Holland more than a decade ago,
and even the uninitiated should, early on, get the hang of it and
"WinTuition."</TE>

<HD>Cash machines spawn a green revolution of sorts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Craig Tomashoff</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During my college days, which I like to think weren't all that long
ago, Friday afternoons were always the same. Drop everything and rush
to the bank by 3 p.m. to get spending cash or face the prospect of a
very long, very cheap weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Credit cards were too costly in the long run and finding a bar
that took personal checks was slightly more difficult than finding
someone who admitted to voting for Michael Dukakis. This was a time
when getting cash was almost harder than holding onto it.</LD>
<LD>   These days, it seems to be just the opposite. Automated teller
machines have sprung up with greater frequency than Starbucks
franchises over the past decade or so, making it extremely easy to
get your money and, therefore, harder to resist spending it.</LD>
<TE>   With little fanfare, they have infiltrated our lives to an amazing
degree. There are roughly 324,000 machines in the U.S. alone --
springing up everywhere from convenience stores to hotel lobbies to
the local mall. But their influence goes far beyond getting beer
money whenever and wherever you need it.</TE>
<TE>   There's the new Barbie Bank With Me toy, which features the famous
doll and her ready-to-use toy ATM card, teaching kids just out of
disposable diapers the meaning of disposable income.</TE>
<TE>   And there's the recent installation of a teller machine high atop
China's Huang Shan mountain. There's even been talk of applying the
technology to voting in major cities.</TE>
<TE>   Cash machines have become an industry unto themselves, with one
being installed somewhere around the world every six minutes,
according to the Automated Teller Machine Industry Assn., which held
its annual conference last month in San Diego. The association, an
alliance of those who manufacture, service and sell ATMs, doesn't
just see itself as a trade organization dedicated to improving the
quality and reputation of cash machines. Its executive director,
Michael Lee, also considers his organization to be like a group of
democratic freedom fighters.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to remember that the money in banks doesn't belong to the
banks. It's our own money," he explains.</TE>
<TE>   "ATM technology has helped us realize this. The technology has
freed us in terms of time and space. You can go where you want to get
your own money whenever you want it. To me, this is all about a
revolution in our society."</TE>
<TE>   So, in a sense, every time you use your ATM card, you are striking
a blow for independence. Although, as ATM user Tony Santos of Playa
del Rey put it when told of Lee's position, "If this were truly a
democratic revolution, why is it that we can still only take out $300
at a time?"</TE>
<TE>   The technology responsible for our economic liberation is still
relatively new, at least compared to other life-changing technology
like the microchip or potato chips that come in a can. The modern
version of the ATM was created in England in the mid-1960s by a man
named John Shepherd-Barron, who came up with the idea while in his
bathtub. (No doubt, on a Saturday night as he pondered how he was
going to find cash to pay for an evening on the town.)</TE>
<TE>   A few years later, a Texan named Don Wetzel devised his own
version of the machine while waiting in an excessively long bank
line. It wasn't until the latter 1980s that ATMs really gained a
foothold in our lives, however, and began showing up everywhere,
including the plaza of L.A.'s newest cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   It's no coincidence that the presence of cash machines increased
about the same time as 24-hour grocery stores and open-all-night
fast-food joints. "It's really become one of the main drivers of the
self-service, 24/7 society that we now live in," says Lee. "If you're
shopping at 2 in the morning and you need cash, the ATM has liberated
that access. It's shaped society quite dramatically from that
standpoint."</TE>
<TE>   It shouldn't surprise anyone that acquiring cash comes with a
price. In this case, that involves security and user fees. Industry
experts detailed some of the new techniques thieves have found to
raid card users' accounts. One of the most popular approaches is
known as "skimming." Criminals place a false front on an ATM machine,
complete with a screen and a place to swipe your card. That front
then records card and code numbers, which criminals can use to create
their own duplicate cards.</TE>
<TE>   "Security happens to be at the top of our awareness," explains
Michael Hudson, a conference attendee and chief executive officer of
Tidel, an ATM manufacturer. Out of the billions of ATM transactions
though, he insists that "security issues are a very small percentage.
Ninety-eight percent or more of the transactions are done legally. We
just want to make sure that our own technology doesn't get turned
against us."</TE>
<TE>   None of this has killed consumer craving for instant cash.
According to Lee, surveys have found that the ATM is the second most
trusted consumer device, trailing only the home telephone.</TE>
<TE>   "People are just used to the machines operating smoothly and
quickly," he says. "My bank is in England, but when I got here to the
San Diego airport, I went to the ATM and drew local currency. The
authorization process for that took seconds. And I realized that the
quality of the technology is so good, that's where the trust comes
in."</TE>
<TE>   It's a privilege we're also willing to pay for. There's now a fee
attached to using the bulk of ATMs, but most of the conference-goers
seemed to be in agreement that this was essentially a dead issue.
Federal courts recently shot down bans on user fees in Santa Monica
and San Francisco, which didn't surprise anyone at the San Diego
event.</TE>
<TE>   "We do care about the fees because they help to support and pay
for these machines. They're inextricable from the business," says
Ernest Burdette, president of Triton, a firm that has more than
70,000 ATMs around the world. "I think consumers have settled on the
fact that they get value for that charge. It's a convenience. People
are willing to pay $1.50 not to wait in line for something so they
can get home in time for dinner."</TE>
<TE>   But even as we become more willing to pay for the privilege of
getting our money, many of the new gimmicks in store for ATMs are
missing one thing: cash. At the ATM conference, there were models
that would allow customers to buy money orders and send them off to
family or friends. Another seemed to sell everything from additional
minutes on cell phones to movie tickets to CDs to flowers. One design
would even allow a customer to use an ATM card to create another
debit card.</TE>
<TE>   "I would never say cash won't remain king, but the additional
products and services are going to turn it into more than just a cash
device," says Scott White, director of content delivery for NCR, one
of the country's busiest ATM makers.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what the future holds, there's still one place you're
always likely to find cash -- the pockets of attendees at an ATM
conference.</TE>
<TE>   A random survey of the people in the display hall found that
nobody had less than $40 in their pocket, and that the hot spot at
the conference hotel just might have been the ATM machine by the
front desk.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw a line of people in the lobby waiting to use it when I got
here," said Jaimee Urell, a representative of Cash Connect banking
service, with a laugh. "It looked like the place to be."</TE>

<HD>'Tis seasoning</HD>
<DH>A rosemary bush makes a nifty -- and tasty -- yule tree.</DH>

<LD>Like pines, they have needles. Like pines, they fill the room with a
lovely aroma. And like pines, they look cool with lights on them. But
unlike the traditional Christmas tree, these taste good.</LD>
<LD>   There have been many entries in the never-ending quest for new
holiday twists. But this one -- the rosemary plant that doubles as a
Christmas tree -- seems to have struck a chord. After a few years of
selling out before they had a decent chance to be noticed, the plants
are suddenly in stock everywhere from Home Depot to Whole Foods.</LD>
<LD>   Grown specifically for use as Christmas trees, the potted rosemary
plants have been pruned to look very much like traditional trees.
And, except for being smaller, they do. A major selling point: no
need to lug this tree to a Dumpster or figure out how to recycle it
after the holidays. It can be kept indoors or transplanted outdoors
into an herb garden to be enjoyed -- and to season meals -- into the
future.</LD>
<TE>   "We can't grow enough of them to meet the demand," says Lynn
Strohsahl, president of Pinery Tree Farms in Escondido, which is a
primary grower. He says each year the stores they supply want more of
them than they did the year before.</TE>
<TE>   Jo-Anne Newton of El Modeno Gardens says the plants capitalize on
growing consumer demand for smaller, living trees to decorate for the
holidays. Her company started raising the trees about seven years ago
and said this is the year they're really taking off in popularity.</TE>
<TE>   The rosemary plants are not as tall as traditional pines, but
they're tall enough to carry off being decorated. The ones in
5-gallon containers are 3 to 4 feet tall; in 2-gallon containers, 1
1/2 to 2 feet tall; and in 6-inch pots, about 15 inches tall. Prices
range from about $7 for the smaller ones to $20 or more for the
taller versions.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the woodsy, herbal scent that permeates a room with
the plant in it, rosemary has an extra benefit over other living
Christmas trees: It blooms with small blue flowers at this time of
year.</TE>
<TE>   Its Latin genus name, Rosmarinus,  translates as "dew of the sea."
The plant is also known as the herb of remembrance because it is
thought to enhance memory. It can be brewed into a tea or used as a
seasoning in cooking -- in meats, breads, soups, salads -- and for
barbecuing, either to flavor the food or to scent the coals.</TE>
<TE>   Rosemary plants are hardy and like bright light but not direct
sun. Using ice cubes to water them is recommended because the slow
melt leaves the soil evenly moist.</TE>
<TE>   After a lifetime of cut pine Christmas trees, Taryn Poole and
Michele Kuraner of Silver Lake switched to a live rosemary this year.
"I wish we had thought of this before," says Poole. "The smell is
magnificent, and it's so much easier to care for than a cut tree."</TE>
<TE>   Poole and Kuraner are looking forward to the end of the season
rather than dreading it. "Instead of having pine needles falling off
a big dead tree," Poole said, "we'll be planting ours outdoors and
watching it grow all year long."</TE>
<TE>   To say nothing of enjoying it with dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Rosemary Christmas trees are carried by Home Depot, Orchard Supply
Hardware, Lowe's, Anawalt Lumber, Wal-Mart, Whole Foods and others.</TE>

<HD>Chanticleer's collective power</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josef Woodard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a program called "A Chanticleer Christmas," you come expecting
the vocal ensemble to heed the muse of variety rather than artistic
cohesion, which was clearly the case Saturday at the Irvine Barclay
Theater. This stellar 12-man vocal group celebrates its 25th
anniversary this season, having carved out success with the ample
power of its collective voice and a freewheeling diversity.</LD>
<LD>   So nobody blinked much when the program ran from lustrously
rendered early music to elegant responses to the caroling imperative.
Chanticleer opened on a movingly austere note, singing 13th century
plainsong in candlelight and formal attire, and ended in casual Perry
Como-esque sweaters, with an encore of Vince Guaraldi's "Christmas
Time Is Here."</LD>
<LD>   Chanticleer gets away with variety shows like this because of the
renewable joy of hearing its unerring vocal mesh and the obvious
depth of musicality. Plus, the holiday spirit is forgiving.</LD>
<TE>   Although they opened the second half of the concert with the
soothing "Ave Maria" by German composer Franz Biebl (1906-2001) --
which they have popularized -- it was the "Ave Maria" of 500 years
earlier, by Josquin Desprez, that left a stronger impression.
Exquisitely interwoven voices conjured up a timeless beauty, as it
also did on Praetorius' sublime "In Dulci Jubilo."</TE>
<TE>   Splitting the difference between early and contemporary music, the
very alive and thinking British composer John Tavener was represented
by a few pieces, with his usual reconsidered antiquity. In the carol
department, Chanticleer drew on smart versions, arranged by the likes
of Ralph Vaughan Williams and David Wilcocks. Still, this segment
seemed to risk floating away from earlier seriousness.</TE>
<TE>   Musical director Joseph Jennings' arrangement of spirituals saved
the day, a refreshing deviation from the yuletide norm, sung with
convincing soulfulness.</TE>

<HD>Combating arrhythmia by controlling heart rate</HD>
<DH>The most common treatments may not be the best choice, a
study says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane E. Allen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many people with a common heart rhythm abnormality may not be getting
the most effective treatment.</LD>
<LD>   The first step in treating atrial fibrillation, especially among
elderly patients, should be controlling the rate at which the heart
beats, rather than trying to correct the rhythm, a large comparison
study has concluded.</LD>
<LD>   Patients getting either treatment felt better, but those given
rhythm-correcting medications or a heart-shocking procedure called
cardioversion had more hospitalizations and medication side effects
than those taking drugs to control their heart rate, researchers
found.</LD>
<TE>   The study of 4,060 U.S. and Canadian patients, published in the
Dec. 5 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, along with a
smaller European study in the same issue, is likely to change the way
doctors treat atrial fibrillation, which affects 2.3 million
Americans and is expected to affect as many as 6 million by 2040 as
the baby boomers age.</TE>
<TE>   "In older folks, I think a lot more of them are going to get rate
control," said Dr. D. George Wyse, a cardiology professor at the
University of Calgary in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   With atrial fibrillation, the upper chambers of the heart, called
the atria, contract so quickly that they quiver. As a result, they
don't pump blood properly into the lower chambers, called the
ventricles. The heartbeat becomes erratic and blood flow can become
stagnant, increasing the risk that clots will form and travel to the
brain, resulting in a stroke. Although some patients report no
symptoms, others experience heart palpitations, shortness of breath
and dizziness.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is chronic; even when fibrillation is brought under
control, "it's going to come back," Wyse said.</TE>
<TE>   The new data finally give doctors information upon which to base
their treatment decisions, which changed with the arrival of
anti-arrhythmia drugs in the late 1970s and 1980s. For the first
time, there were drugs "that had a reasonable chance of getting you
back into a normal rhythm," Wyse said. Consequently, most doctors
moved away from the older strategy of going after the heart rate with
drugs such as digitalis, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a back-to-the-future story, a less-is-more story," said
Wyse, who chaired the steering committee for the study, called Atrial
Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management, sponsored
by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National
Institutes of Health. With the anti-arrhythmic drugs, "everybody just
assumed there were a lot of advantages; if you were in a normal
rhythm, you'd feel better."</TE>
<TE>   But the reality was that the newer drugs, such as amiodarone,
which can cause a potentially fatal condition called pulmonary
fibrosis, were tough on patients, and many of them still had
recurrences of their fibrillation.</TE>
<TE>   The study also demonstrated the importance of patients with the
rhythm disorder taking an anticoagulant, such as warfarin. Although
rhythm control treatments were supposed to let patients stop taking
warfarin, Wyse said, "what we found is you can't stop warfarin: Most
strokes in both groups occur when they stop the warfarin or when the
dose is too low."</TE>

<HD>High-impact aerobics and low-profile classes</HD>
<DH>The once-popular exercise is hard to find on gym schedules
filled with newer ways to fitness. The reasons are varied.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barely 10 minutes into class, knees are pumping, feet are flying and
instructor Rochelle Savoy isn't cutting her students any slack.</LD>
<LD>   "Pick it up, people, pick it up!" she roars into her microphone as
she leads them in a combination of jumping jacks, grapevine steps,
kicks and other sweat-inducing moves that doesn't let up for 45
minutes.</LD>
<LD>   In the world of health and fitness clubs, it doesn't get much more
old school than this -- high-impact aerobics the way it was 15 years
ago, complete with deafening, pounding dance music, intricate
choreography and a bouncy, motivational instructor yelling, "I need
more sweat! More sweat!"</LD>
<TE>   But classes like the one Savoy leads on Monday nights at Bally
Total Fitness in Hawthorne are becoming difficult to find. The words
"high impact" and "aerobics" rarely appear on gyms' class schedules
anymore, replaced by the likes of Cardio Kick Boxing, Boot Camp,
Afro-Latino Dance Grooves, Power Abs and something called Killer X
Training. In fitness, there's been an evolution in group exercise
toward creative high-energy classes that reference dance (hip-hop to
samba) and athletics (martial arts to boxing), as well as a huge
increase in more spiritually oriented, mind/body programs such as
yoga and Pilates. Research into the benefits of balance, flexibility
and good posture have resulted in classes revolving around balance
boards and inflatable exercise balls. The reasons for the shift are
as varied as the new slate of classes themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "The baby boomers are getting older, and they don't want to kill
themselves," says Nanette Pattee Francini, founder and executive vice
president of Sports Club Co., which operates Sports Club/LA and other
fitness clubs around the country. "They want a kinder, gentler
workout. And the younger people are really into spirituality.''</TE>
<TE>   In most of the club's nine locations, including Los Angeles, the
word "aerobics" doesn't even appear on class schedules, says
Francini. "A lot of classes are cardio-oriented but not necessarily
high impact. And what you're seeing a lot of is combining two
modalities, such as martial arts and boxing."</TE>
<TE>   Competition among gyms has also been a factor in the changing
direction, says Donna Cyrus, national director of group fitness
programming for Crunch Fitness. As the roster of clubs grew,
especially in image-conscious urban areas such as L.A., unique
classes became a way to attract and retain members.</TE>
<TE>   "We found a way to diversify ourselves by being more cutting
edge," she says. "You'd still be getting a cardiovascular workout,
but with a bit more bells and whistles."</TE>
<TE>   Exercisers can also learn a skill while they sweat, she points
out: "The first big move from high impact was to Tai Boxing
[combining boxing and martial arts moves], and then we brought in
dance-based classes like hip-hop. You could use these moves at a
disco, or tie it to something on MTV. It's a different way to do the
same [exercises], but it's much more interesting."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to its much-hyped Cardio Striptease class, Crunch's
L.A. gym also offers Circus Sports, using a trapeze and rings, and a
hula-hoop class. Popular in New York is the Broadway Dance Series, in
which a cast member from a Broadway show teaches choreography from
various numbers. Right now it's "Hairspray," complete with wigs.</TE>
<TE>   Growing group fitness trends include yoga, Pilates, core
conditioning (strengthening the body's midsection) and classes that
combine similar disciplines, as well as dissimilar ones,  such as
yoga and Spinning, according to the IDEA Health &amp; Fitness Assn., a
San Diego-based organization of health and fitness professionals.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are afraid to try an hour of Spinning," says IDEA
Executive Director Kathie Davis, "so this is a way to introduce
people to things they might be too gun-shy to try. It also works all
major muscle groups without feeling tied to one thing."</TE>
<TE>   A recent survey by IDEA found that 53% of U.S. fitness clubs in
2002 offer high-impact classes, up from 35% in 2001. But Davis
attributes the rise not to traditional high-impact classes, but to
the increase in dance and other multidiscipline classes.</TE>
<TE>   Injuries, such as ankle and knee sprains, may also have
contributed to the move away from strict high-impact aerobics some 10
years ago, says Davis.</TE>
<TE>   That may be true, says Harold Kohl, an epidemiologist with the
Indianapolis-based American College of Sports Medicine, although
actual figures haven't been tracked to see if a shift to lower impact
exercises has resulted in fewer injuries. "It may be most important,"
he adds, "to get the message across of the old idea of
cross-training. Five days of high-impact aerobics probably isn't as
good for your muscular-skeletal health as mixing it up with strength
training and yoga, especially as people get older and want to age
healthfully."</TE>
<TE>   At Bally's, Savoy believes that adding variety to her aerobics
classes has helped her to sustain a loyal following of students for
more than three years.</TE>
<TE>   Orenda Waters, a 25-year-old actress from Los Angeles, is among
Savoy's followers who credits the class with her 60-pound weight
loss. "If you miss it, you feel like you missed church or something,"
she says. "When I take this class, I don't have to take other
classes."</TE>
<TE>   Although most fitness experts agree that gyms will continue to
offer classes incorporating some aspects of high-impact
cardio-vascular exercise, what form they'll take is anyone's guess.</TE>
<TE>   "Some essence of it will continue to prevail," says Crunch's
Cyrus. "I've had conversations with instructors about bringing it
back in a Crunch-type format. There's a generation out there that has
never experienced it, and there could be a kind of retro revival."</TE>

<LD>When the wildly popular drug combo phen-fen was pulled from the
market in 1997, people were forced to look elsewhere for weight-loss
help. Many turned to a then-mysterious Chinese herb known as ma
huang.</LD>
<LD>   The natural supplement, commonly known as ephedra, seemed less
risky than the prescription medicines, which had been linked to heart
valve problems. But now the federal government is reviewing the
supplement's safety, and one manufacturer of ephedra is under
criminal investigation by the Justice Department. Once again, many
consumers are searching for a safe alternative.</LD>
<LD>   Although supporters contend that ephedra is safe, some major
sellers already are scaling back or abandoning sales of products
containing the herb.</LD>
<TE>   The maker of one of the most popular supplements, Ripped Fuel,
said last month that it will discontinue it and other ephedra
products.</TE>
<TE>   Dietary supplement giant Herbalife has begun phasing out its three
ephedra products and is instead promoting a new ephedra-free line of
supplements.</TE>
<TE>   General Nutrition Centers, the largest retailer of dietary
supplements, announced Nov. 6 that it will request proof of age from
customers purchasing products with ephedra to stop sales to minors.</TE>
<TE>   The moves follow several months of particularly bad publicity.
Although ephedra may indeed help the body burn fat -- it's known as a
thermogenic aid, meaning it raises metabolism and increases heart
rate -- that weight-loss potential may come with a risk. Some studies
have linked use of the herb to stroke, heart attack, seizures and
sudden death. The Food and Drug Administration says it has received
more than 1,200 reports of adverse events linked to ephedra, although
supplement makers say the health problems could have occurred even if
people hadn't taken ephedra.</TE>
<TE>   Growing concern over the safety of ephedra prompted the Bush
administration, in June, to order a scientific review of the herb.
Two months later, the Justice Department announced it was conducting
a criminal investigation to probe whether a major manufacturer of
ephedra, Metabolife, lied about the safety of its products.</TE>
<TE>   "Ephedra is getting a very bad name, even though a definitive
review of the safety of ephedra hasn't been published," said Mark
Blumenthal, executive director of the American Botanical Council, a
nonprofit educational and research organization. "It's the 900-pound
gorilla that is getting all the attention."</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers trace their flagging support for ephedra to consumer
unease about the herb's safety, the rising costs of liability
insurance and the threat of a possible government crack-down. It
doesn't hurt that they also seem to have found a promising
alternative, one known by the healthy-sounding name "bitter orange."</TE>
<TE>   Bitter orange, or Citrus aurantium, is emerging as the central
ingredient in a new generation of herbal weight-loss products. Both
Twinlab and Herbalife announced the demise of their ephedra products
at the same time they introduced those containing Citrus aurantium.
Several other supplement makers also have launched ephedra-free
formulations containing bitter orange, including Xenadrine EFX and
TurboTrim Plus Ephedra Free.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been happy with the [ephedra] products. They've worked very
well. But, basically, it's the media attention and the FDA circling
around. We've decided to go the high road," said Dr. Jamie McManus,
senior vice president of the Herbalife medical advisory board. The
company is introducing an ephedra-free formulation called Total
Control.</TE>
<TE>   But some experts say exchanging ephedra for Citrus aurantium may
not protect consumers from harm or manufacturers from controversy.
Because the herb is chemically similar to ephedra, it could cause
similar health problems, they warn.</TE>
<TE>   Although several supplement companies say they've tested Citrus
aurantium, the results of that research have not been published or
peer-reviewed for scientific validity. The studies that have been
published have been small; one 1999 U.S. study of 23 people showed
those taking Citrus aurantium for six weeks experienced a decrease in
body fat of about 6 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a new kid on the block. But we don't know if it's a good kid
or a bad kid," said Bill Gurley, a professor of pharmaceutical
sciences at the University of Arkansas. Manufacturers "really don't
have to do any research before putting these things on the market. So
how do you really know if they're safe?"</TE>
<TE>   Citrus aurantium is made from the immature fruit of a plant known
in various parts of the world as bitter orange, sour orange or
Seville orange. In China, the fruit is known as zhi shi and is used
in traditional Chinese medicine to relieve chest congestion and
indigestion. Its active substance, synephrine, is chemically similar
to ephedra, and both are considered thermogenic weight-loss aids.</TE>
<TE>   "The two work much the same way. Citrus aurantium will boost
metabolic rate and, indirectly, cause the breakdown of fat," said
Dennis Jones, a Vermont scientist who began working on Citrus
aurantium 10 years ago and created the brand called Advantra Z.</TE>
<TE>   Some herb makers say that bitter orange will work as well as
ephedra but without affecting the central nervous system or the
heart. "It has the same effects in the periphery of the body, but
it's weaker," said Jones. "It's nowhere near as potent."</TE>
<TE>   Gurley agrees that Citrus aurantium by itself probably has little
effect. But herbal weight-loss products are typically mixtures of
various herbs, such as caffeine to boost metabolism and herbs that
act as diuretics. Blending several herbs typically increases
effectiveness. In the same manner, mixing Citrus aurantium with other
herbs may improve its potency, making it more effective and,
potentially, more dangerous to some users, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you'll see the same types of problems as ephedra," he
said. "Normally, synephrine is not well-absorbed in the
gastrointestinal tract. But there are compounds in some of these
products that could aid absorption."</TE>
<TE>   For example, Gurley said, the herbs guarana and green tea have the
potential to exacerbate the activity of Citrus aurantium.</TE>
<TE>   Another potential problem with Citrus aurantium is that it could
interact with a host of prescription drugs, said Gurley, who is
studying the herb. Citrus aurantium inhibits an enzyme, known as
CYP3A4, in the small intestine that can alter the metabolism of
drugs, boosting their activity.</TE>
<TE>   "We know this enzyme is responsible for the metabolic activity of
50% of all prescription medications," he said. "We know that Seville
orange juice can wipe out those enzymes. It would be reasonable to
think that these concentrated extracts would do the same."</TE>
<TE>   Both Jones and McManus said the studies they've seen, performed at
McGill University in Montreal and by Herbalife, have not shown any
side effects.</TE>
<TE>   But until more is known about Citrus aurantium weight-loss
products, however, Gurley urges caution. "It's like where we were six
years ago with ephedra."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, whether the federal government pulls ephedra off
the market -- as the American Medical Assn. recently urged -- remains
to be seen. The safety report ordered by the Bush administration is
due out early next year and could help government and industry
leaders reach a consensus on how to best regulate ephedra. The Rand
Corp. of Santa Monica is developing the report.</TE>
<TE>   "That report is going to be the defining word, or something close
to it," Blumenthal said. "I think the Rand report constitutes a very
good development in the saga of ephedra because it's an independent
review."</TE>
<TE>   Leaders in the supplement industry continue to defend ephedra's
safety when taken by healthy individuals in the recommended doses.
Industry representatives are working with the FDA to create labeling
for all ephedra products that would state proper dosage and which
individuals should avoid taking the herb, said Michael McGuffin,
president of the American Herbal Products Assn., a national trade
organization for the herb supplement industry.</TE>
<TE>   But, Blumenthal notes, some herb supplement makers feel the entire
herbal field is being dragged down by the safety questions
surrounding ephedra.</TE>
<TE>   "Some companies do not sell ephedra and don't care if it's
regulated into a corner or removed from the market," he said. "They
just want to see the problem go away because they see the constant
negative attention as being ultimately deleterious to the entire
industry."</TE>

<HD>Why mistakes occur in hospitals</HD>
<DH>An exhaustive study zeroes in on dangerous errors in
medication.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Linda Marsa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hospital medication errors occur with alarming frequency, studies
have shown, causing thousands of injuries and deaths each year. Now
research has pinpointed exactly where, and how often, those mistakes
occur.</LD>
<LD>   United States Pharmacopeia, which establishes quality standards
for medicines, announced the results last week of the most exhaustive
study to date on hospital medication errors. The report said most
errors involved the omission of prescribed drugs, dispensing the
wrong drug, improper dosages and failure to properly administer
prescribed medications. Such information is essential to devising
effective strategies to prevent mistakes, said Diane D. Cousins, a
USP vice president.</LD>
<LD>   Since a 1999 Institute of Medicine report, which revealed that at
least 7,000 Americans die each year from medication errors, hospitals
have sought ways to increase patient safety. The new findings show
errors are still rampant and underscore the need for patients to be
vigilant, even in a setting that seems to be safe, the study's
authors said.</LD>
<TE>   The report analyzed medication mistakes in 2001 at 368 community,
government and teaching hospitals nationwide, representing slightly
more than 6% of the 5,890 hospitals in the United States. Of the
105,603 errors recorded, most were corrected before harm was done,
but in 2.4% of the cases, patients were injured. Some required
prolonged hospitalization in intensive care, and 14 died.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the injuries were caused by improper administration
techniques, such as the incorrect dilution of intravenous drugs or
improper dosages of drugs. Incorrect computer entries, poor
communication, inaccurate records in patient charts and unclear
handwriting were other sources of errors.</TE>
<TE>   The report also identified five "high alert" medications --
insulin, morphine, potassium chloride and the anticoagulants heparin
and warfarin -- that have a higher risk of patient injury when
dispensed incorrectly. Because the drugs are so often used, the
potential for harm is significant. Errors administering these
medications were responsible for nearly 28% of medication errors that
resulted in extended hospitalizations and death. Insulin alone
accounted for about a third of that figure.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers have a responsibility as well, Cousins said, and need to
be well-informed and aware of what medicines they're being given. One
mishap, for instance, was averted by a patient who noticed a pill was
a different color from the one the nurse had dispensed earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "Patients should know what medications they're taking and be
involved," Cousins said. "In the case of an acutely ill patient, a
friend or family member should be their advocate."</TE>
<TE>   But patient awareness is only part of the solution, experts say.
"Hospitals and state oversight agencies need to be more proactive,"
said Michael R. Cohen, president of the nonprofit Institute for Safe
Medication Practices in Huntington Valley, Pa. "If efforts were
focused on these known hazards, errors could be drastically reduced."</TE>

Reasons for errors
The 105,603 errors in the United States
Pharmacopeia report fall into 11
categories. Because some errors had more
than one cause, the numbers add up to
more than 100%

<DH>Tot-sized equipment lets kids work out like grown-ups
(assuming they want to).</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now, preschoolers can just do it too.</LD>
<LD>   When Mommy or Daddy hops on the treadmill, the little tykes can
work out alongside -- on their very own mini-treadmill. There's also
a mini-exercise bike and a mini-workout bench with foam weights --
all specifically designed for the Playhouse Disney set.</LD>
<LD>   The home exercise equipment for preschoolers is being pitched as
ideal holiday gifts that offer sweet and sweaty moments of family
togetherness by Sport-Fun Inc., a Los Angeles-based company that
manufactures and markets the products, which retail for $70 to $100.</LD>
<TE>   Karl Aaronian, Sport-Fun's vice president of marketing, says the
products are designed to offer parents an exercise alternative that
will help entice children away from the TV and computer and,
hopefully, "build healthy habits early on and ... have fun in the
process."</TE>
<TE>   But what if kids find walking on a treadmill as boring as their
parents often do?</TE>
<TE>   That's the concern of some child development experts, who fear
that the machines may send an unintended message -- that exercise
isn't much fun. But these experts acknowledge that the equipment
could be useful if it helps to support family activities that promote
health.</TE>
<TE>   Few adults would choose to work out on a machine if they had the
energy, free time and boundless curiosity of a 4-year-old, child
specialists say. Children should be encouraged to explore and develop
athletic skills, not get bogged down in routine, they add.</TE>
<TE>   "The main point here is fun," said Kathy Seal, a Los Angeles
writer and co-author of "Motivated Minds: Raising Children to Love
Learning" (Henry Holt, 2001). "Is running on a treadmill fun?.... And
joining the neighborhood T-ball or tumbling team or learning how to
dance is fun. That's really what kids ought to be doing."</TE>
<TE>   Added Deborah Stipek, a professor of education at Stanford
University who has studied childhood development: "It is very hard
for me to see any value whatsoever in such a constrained, uncreative
exercise for a preschooler. To me, it sounds like a great way to turn
them off exercise."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Virgilio, an associate professor in the School of
Education at Adelphi University in Garden City, N.Y., has a different
perspective. He said he became a paid consultant for Sport-Fun after
seeing the preschool exercise machines in action.</TE>
<TE>   "We aren't trying to train kids or check their heart rates.
Instead what we're trying to do is to show them a role model for
behavior," said Virgilio, author of several books on children's
fitness. "We don't want to force kids, but if they show the desire
parents should support that. If they don't, that's not a problem and
[workout equipment] should be put in the corner or the basement."</TE>
<TE>   Although inclement weather isn't usually an issue in Southern
California, rain and snowstorms in other parts of the country can
trap kids indoors, watching videos instead of climbing around on
outdoor playground equipment, Virgilio said.</TE>
<TE>   "With cardiovascular and heart diseases still the No. 1 killer,
why wait until a kid has a weight problem to do something about it?"
said Virgilio, a member of a National Assn. for Sport and Physical
Education panel that issued national guidelines this year for daily
physical activities for children up to age 5.</TE>
<TE>   Childhood obesity, even among preschoolers, has continued to rise.
It is estimated that almost 8% of 4- and 5-year-olds are considered
overweight, nearly double the figure of 20 years ago, according to
recent studies. Once overweight, children have a 70% chance of
carrying the problem into adulthood, some studies have shown.</TE>
<TE>   Sport-Fun, which also makes pogo sticks, skateboards and other
action toys, launched the Kid Starts product line this summer and is
hoping for strong holiday sales.</TE>
<TE>   The private company doesn't release sales figures, but spokeswoman
Deena Lewis says the firm is having difficulty keeping up with
orders. "It's selling incredibly well," she says.</TE>

<LD>To stretch your back muscles, try rolling like a ball. This exercise
will strengthen your abdominals and give your spine a nice little
massage. Just be sure to do the exercise on a cushioned surface or
extra-thick mat.</LD>
<LD>   1 Begin by loosely hugging your knees into your chest, placing one
hand around each ankle. Bring your chin to your chest and move your
navel in toward your spine as you engage your abdominals. Lift your
feet a few inches and balance evenly on your hips.</LD>
<LD>   2 As you exhale, shift your weight backward, and roll back. Pause
for a moment before rolling up to the balanced position again. Make
sure you roll up and down evenly on the center of your spine. Keep
your movements well-controlled and try not to let momentum carry you
through the exercise. A good time to do this exercise is first thing
in the morning and before you go to sleep at night.</LD>

<LD>At first, the thought of cross-country skis in L.A. made about as
much sense to me as bare midriffs in Minneapolis in December.</LD>
<LD>   Then I discovered that Big Bear and Mammoth have great
cross-country trails, that you won't spend a dime on lift tickets
ever and that the sport is an all-body blast that incinerates
calories like running seven-minute miles. Suddenly, a day of kicking
and gliding through quiet, white-blanketed forests -- either as a
fitness break from downhill skiing or an adventure all its own --
seems irresistible. And so are this season's new skis, which are
loaded with innovations designed to make life easy for beginners.</LD>
<LD>   Secure footing</LD>
<TE>   Fischer Nordic Cruiser (classic skis): Unique design emphasizes
control for beginners and intermediates. Classic skis fit in
machine-sculpted tracks and are propelled by a back-and-forth Nordic
Track-type motion. They're easier to master than "skate" skis, which
use an in-line skate motion.</TE>
<TE>   Likes: Great for beginners. Unusual undulating shape -- from wide
to narrow to wide and back again -- places your feet squarely on the
wide midsection, promoting a secure feeling. Far less hassle than
slick-bottomed performance skis, which use sticky, finicky wax to
grip the snow.</TE>
<TE>   Dislikes: The wider width may slow gliding.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $200. (800) 844-7810; www.fischerskis.com.</TE>
<TE>   The need for speed</TE>
<TE>   Madshus Vario Lillehammer (classic skis): A recreational ski
designed for speed.</TE>
<TE>   Likes: You can learn on it but not outgrow it. Feels faster than
other wax-free recreational skis; unusually deep, angular pattern in
the under-the-foot "kick zone" gives superb grip and push-off. Seems
quieter than the typical raspy scraping for those who want to enjoy
the backcountry solitude.</TE>
<TE>   Dislikes: Fast but still too slow for racers. Lacks glide speed of
a waxed ski.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $150. (800) 425-7462, www.alpinasports.com.</TE>
<TE>   Graceful gliding</TE>
<TE>   Rossignol Evolution Free (skating skis): A stubby
beginner-intermediate model (roughly 20 centimeters shorter than
normal skating skis).</TE>
<TE>   Likes: You may surprise yourself with your newfound grace on skis.
Great maneuverability in turns due to an odd-looking
3-millimeter-high plate beneath the binding, which allows this short
ski to hold an edge. Feels light on your foot.</TE>
<TE>   Dislikes: Good glide but lacks the speed of a longer skating ski.
Like all skate skis, requires application of wax.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $189. (800) 437-6771; www.rossignol.com.</TE>
<TE>   Go-anywhere thrills</TE>
<TE>   Karhu Meta Sweeper: Nothing else like it, this is the Jeep of the
cross-country ski world. Very wide and one-quarter shorter than
standard cross-country skis. It's the first designed to go "off
trail" into ungroomed snow in the backcountry.</TE>
<TE>   Likes: Go-anywhere adventure, thrills and a workout reminiscent of
mountain biking. Climbs uphill like a snowshoe, flies downhill like
an alpine ski. Built-in, high-back binding eliminates the need to buy
boots. You can wear your own shoes, but high-top hikers will work
best.</TE>
<TE>   Dislikes: Steep downhills are scary for non-alpine skiers. If
that's you, start off on shallower slopes until you gain confidence.
Slower on regular groomed trails. Note: The Karhu skis, which use the
Nordic Track-type motion, are too wide to fit in the machine tracks
of classic cross-country skiing.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $250; (888) 288-2668, www.karhu.com.</TE>

<HD>A bionic nerve's power</HD>
<DH>The experimental muscle stimulator offers new hope for
recovery from strokes and spinal cord injuries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Linda Marsa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It sounds like one of those fitness products peddled in late-night
infomercials -- an implantable stimulator that electrically exercises
muscles. But if current tests prove it effective, this miniature
device could revolutionize the treatment of strokes and spinal cord
injuries.</LD>
<LD>   In these conditions, nerve signals that spark normal muscle
function are blocked, causing paralysis. Over time, unused muscles
atrophy, which can make rehabilitation and recovery more difficult.
The new device, called a BION because it works like a bionic neuron,
strengthens and retrains these muscles by mimicking the nerve
impulses from the brain.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists know that electricity can be used to activate nerves
and muscles throughout the body, said Dr. Gerald E. Loeb, a
biomedical engineer who invented the muscle stimulator at USC's
Alfred E. Mann Institute for Biomedical Engineering. "But the trick
was to create something that worked inside the muscle without leaving
wires dangling through the skin."</LD>
<TE>   Encapsulated in glass with electrodes at each end, the tiny device
(it's the size of two grains of rice) is injected with a large needle
directly into the "motor spot" -- the place where nerve endings meet
muscle. When the muscles are ready to be exercised, a magnetic
transmitter coil is placed over that part of the body. The coil sends
power and command signals to the implant, prompting it to emit
electrical pulses that activate the muscles.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a real advance over what we have to treat people with
severe muscle weakness," said Dr. Stephen D. Bagg, a stroke
specialist at Queen's University in Canada who has studied the
device. Because it could be used at home, it is expected to be more
convenient and produce better patient compliance. Although the
technology won't make anyone buff, it can reverse muscle atrophy,
strengthen joints and enhance flexibility.</TE>
<TE>   Therapeutic muscle stimulation is already used as part of physical
therapy in patients who have sustained nerve damage. But current
methods have drawbacks that limit their widespread use.</TE>
<TE>   The more common treatment is an electrical stimulator used on the
surface of the skin. However, the electrical jolts can be painful,
too high a charge can burn the skin, and the impulses may not hit the
muscle in the right place. On the other hand, devices inserted
directly into the muscles have to be surgically implanted, with
electrical leads protruding through the skin, which increases risks
of infection and breakage.</TE>
<TE>   The new device seems to be just as effective, but without these
disadvantages. The first human tests of the bionic nerve began in
1999 in Canada, when the device was inserted into the shoulder
muscles of 11 people who had recently suffered a stroke. The shoulder
is a shallow joint and is held together by the activity of the
muscles. When the muscles are flaccid, the weight of the muscles and
the bone pulls the arm out of its socket, a painful shoulder
dislocation that afflicts many stroke victims.</TE>
<TE>   The study volunteers used the device, which can send up to 3,000
commands per second, at home for 20 to 30 minutes two to three times
a day. At the end of six weeks, X-rays revealed that the therapy had
strengthened muscles and that the shoulder joint either remained
aligned or, if it had already slipped out of place, had returned to
its normal position.</TE>
<TE>   Italian researchers have also tested the bionic nerve on patients
with osteoarthritis in their knees. Because sufferers avoid bending
their knees because of the arthritis pain, the muscles often atrophy.
In that 12-week study, the volunteers experienced a significant
reduction in pain and disability, and one even postponed a scheduled
joint replacement surgery, Loeb said.</TE>
<TE>   Three new studies funded by the National Institutes of Health are
currently enrolling a small number of stroke patients at USC and
Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Hospital. One will use the
BION to treat chronic shoulder pain; another will test whether the
device can help restore muscle function in the hands; and the third
will determine whether it can prevent muscle contractions in the
hands, a condition known as claw hand deformity.</TE>
<TE>   Although the technology is still in a relatively early stage, the
bionic nerve eventually may be used to treat all kinds of
disabilities that result from muscle paralysis, even serious spinal
cord injuries, said Dr. Sophia Chun, medical director of outpatient
clinical and rehabilitation services at Ranchos Los Amigos National
Rehabilitation Center in Downey. "There's a number of exciting
potential applications," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Stroke symptoms and current therapies</TE>
<TE>   Each year, more than 750,000 Americans suffer strokes, which are
injuries to the brain caused by the blockage or rupture of blood
vessels ferrying vital nutrients and oxygen.</TE>
<TE>   Strokes cause different symptoms depending on where the damage
occurred. When the brain region regulating specific movements is
injured, it stops sending nerve signals to animate different muscles.
As a result, many stroke victims suffer from speech and language
difficulties, paralysis, persistent problems with balance and
walking, or they may develop a condition known as spasticity, in
which movement is difficult or uncontrollable.</TE>
<TE>   Traditional stroke treatments include surgery to treat or repair
brain damage, speech therapy and occupational therapy to relearn
daily routine activities. Botox injections also are used to relax
muscles stiffened by spasticity.</TE>
<TE>   But physical therapy is the cornerstone of stroke rehabilitation.
Research has shown that the brain has great capacity to recover and
relearn, but the muscles must be strengthened and retrained. Without
therapy, muscles can deteriorate and result in a permanent loss of
function.</TE>

<HD>Asthma risk for babies</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Putting a baby to bed with a bottle increases the risk of wheezing,
which may persist throughout early childhood and contribute to
asthma, new research shows. Infants with a family history of
allergies appear to be especially vulnerable.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 500 children whose parents had asthma or allergies were
followed for five years as part of an ongoing study on home allergens
and asthma led by Dr. Diane Gold of Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston. During the first two years, parents reported every two months
how often their babies were bottle-fed in bed before sleep. The
parents also kept track of episodes of wheezing and asthma during
that time and for the next three years.</LD>
<LD>   Children who went to bed with a bottle more than three times in
their first year had 50% greater risk of wheezing episodes from ages
1 to 5 than children who went to sleep without one.</LD>
<TE>   The wheezing may be triggered by irritation in the airways,
because formula or milk can flow into them when the infant is lying
flat. Tiny amounts of liquid also can be inhaled and cause spasms in
the airways.</TE>
<TE>   Lead author Dr. Juan C. Celedon, a researcher at Brigham and
Women's Hospital, said children should not be bottle-fed large
amounts of liquid just before bedtime, and should not be put to bed
on their backs immediately after feeding.</TE>
<TE>   The study was published in the December issue of the Journal of
the American Academy of Pediatrics.</TE>
<TE>   Older blood pressure devices may still be the most accurate</TE>
<TE>   It's not unusual for blood pressure to soar at the doctor's
office, but so-called "white coat hypertension" is not necessarily a
sign of nervousness. The reason for an unusually high -- or low --
blood pressure reading may be as simple as a damaged blood pressure
device.</TE>
<TE>   Frequently used dial-recording and digital units are not as
reliable as the old-fashioned, mercury-gauged cuffs and are easily
damaged, some experts say. The non-mercury devices can be as much as
50 (diastolic or systolic) points off, says Daniel W. Jones,
co-chairman of a recent meeting on blood pressure measurement at the
National Institutes of Health. He and other experts are concerned
that dial and digital cuffs are not being regularly checked against
mercury-gauged ones.</TE>
<TE>   Mercury-gauged blood pressure devices are less commonly used
because of concerns about proper mercury disposal should the glass
that contains the toxic substance break. But Jones says every
doctor's office and hospital should have at least one on hand to use
as a check for the dial and digital devices. The panel of 23 experts
recommended, among other things, that research be done to determine
if a system for using mercury devices for calibration purposes could
be implemented.</TE>
<TE>   Stress may affect effectiveness of vaccines</TE>
<TE>   How the immune system responds to stress is at the forefront of
mind-body research. Now, scientists in England have found that
reactions to the meningitis vaccine, which is given routinely before
college, vary according to recipients' psychological well-being.</TE>
<TE>   Because vaccines prompt the body to produce antibodies to ward off
a specific disease, measuring the antibodies is a kind of yardstick
for checking on the immune system. "The results show that the effects
of stress are generalizable to different types of vaccine and,
therefore, may be widespread," says Victoria E. Burns, a coauthor of
the study published in the November/December issue of Psychosomatic
Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Burns and her colleagues at the University of Birmingham in
Britain found that students who scored high on tests of the perceived
stress in their lives -- even when there were few notably stressful
life events -- were at greater risk of having a poorer response to
the vaccine than those who didn't see their lives as especially
stressful. Also, students who scored high on tests of anxiety had
lower levels of antibodies stimulated by the vaccine.</TE>

<HD>Mammograms may spot heart disease</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane E. Allen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The mammogram that most women older than 40 undergo each year may be
able to detect heart disease along with breast problems.</LD>
<LD>   That's because women with calcium deposits in the arteries of
their breasts, which show up in the cancer screenings, have an
increased risk of the same kinds of deposits in their coronary
arteries, researchers from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., have
found. In the heart, these deposits are signs of atherosclerosis, the
buildup of plaque that can break off and cause a heart attack or
stroke.</LD>
<LD>   "The fact that so many women die each year unaware of their heart
ailments illustrates the need for better detection of coronary heart
disease," Dr. Dana Whaley, a study coauthor and Mayo Clinic
radiologist, said in a statement. Because most women undergo routine
breast cancer screenings, mammograms can help pick up coronary artery
disease in women who may have no symptoms. And, she added,
"mammograms are already paid for in terms of time and health-care
dollars."</LD>
<TE>   The researchers looked at mammograms from 1,880 women with an
average age of 65, who had undergone coronary imaging called
angiography as well as mammography within a one-year period between
1991 and 2001. The researchers found that women with calcifications
in their breast arteries had a 20% higher risk for coronary artery
disease compared with other women of the same age.</TE>
<TE>   The lead investigator, Dr. Kirk Doerger, recommended that
radiologists interpreting mammograms also note the amount of
calcification. The results were presented last week at the annual
meeting of the Radiological Society of North America.</TE>

<HD>Choices beyond condoms and vasectomies</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Timothy Gower</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For most American couples, the responsibility of preventing unwanted
pregnancy rests with the woman. That's true for a variety of reasons,
but one fact is inescapable: Women have more birth-control options,
including pills, diaphragms, IUDs, implants, caps, gels, foams,
creams, injections and suppositories. Men have two choices: wear a
condom or get a vasectomy.</LD>
<LD>   Endocrinologist William J. Bremner says men might be more likely
to take responsibility for birth control if they had more methods to
choose from. Bremner is director of a new male contraception research
center at the University of Washington in Seattle, created with $9.5
million in funding from the National Institutes of Health.</LD>
<LD>   While women sometimes wonder aloud why there isn't a version of
the birth-control pill for men, Bremner thinks the ultimate goal
should be to create an array of new male methods to match different
needs and preferences.</LD>
<TE>   "Some men can't remember to take a pill, some don't like shots,"
says Bremner. "Some people like Chevys, some like BMWs. Seems to me
you've got to have some range of product choice."</TE>
<TE>   Still, much of the current research in male contraception focuses
on the same goal: finding ways to alter hormone levels to stop sperm
production.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists know that the pituitary gland uses hormonal messengers
to signal the testes to make sperm and testosterone. The pituitary
gland monitors testosterone levels in the blood; when they reach an
adequate level, the gland stops sending signals to the testes.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists also know that it's possible to quiet the pituitary
gland's signal to the testes by raising blood testosterone levels
artificially with synthetic hormones.</TE>
<TE>   Getting the job done, however, may require amounts large enough to
cause unwanted side effects, such as aggression, impotence and
cholesterol problems. So contraceptive researchers have experimented
with giving men small doses of testosterone combined with progestin,
a synthetic version of the female hormone progesterone, which also
suppresses sperm production.</TE>
<TE>   In a study published in August in the Journal of Clinical
Endocrinology and Metabolism, researchers at the Harbor-UCLA Medical
Center in Torrance brought sperm production to a virtual halt in a
group of men who received regular testosterone injections and had
tiny progestin-packed rods surgically implanted under their skin. The
only significant side effect the men experienced was modest weight
gain.</TE>
<TE>   The study's lead, UCLA endocrinologist Christina Wang, is studying
the effectiveness of an implant for men that combines testosterone
and progestin. Dr. Wang predicts, however, that a combination male
contraceptive using progestin and injected testosterone that's being
developed in Europe will be the first hormonal birth-control method
for men to reach the U.S. market, possibly within a few years.</TE>
<TE>   For now, injecting testosterone is the most reliable way to
deliver the hormone; testosterone pills aren't absorbed well and can
damage the liver. Some medical experts, however, doubt that men will
be enthusiastic about taking a shot, perhaps as often as once a
month, to prevent pregnancies. "That's not going to fly," says Dr.
David F. Archer, a contraceptive researcher at Eastern Virginia
Medical School, in Norfolk, Va. For needle-shy men, however, Archer
and others say it's possible that a safe and effective pill will be
developed.</TE>
<TE>   Bremner disputes the common notion that men aren't willing to take
responsibility for birth control, citing National Academy of Science
statistics showing that U.S. couples rely on male condoms and
vasectomy in nearly one-third of cases.</TE>
<TE>   But we can't help but wonder: Will women trust men who say they're
on the pill? We asked Nicole Beland, who writes the "Girl Next Door"
advice column in Men's Health magazine. She said it depends on the
circumstances. A guy you just met in a bar? "Absolutely not," Beland
says. But for couples in committed relationships, she says the male
pill just might work. "If we trust men to be faithful," she says,
"then I think we can also trust them to take the pill."</TE>
<TE>   Other women, however, might need more convincing about their
partners' sense of responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't even trust my husband to remember to pick up my
dry-cleaning," says my friend Ellen. "Why would I trust him with
contraception?"</TE>

<HD>Some pill users at more risk</HD>
<DH>Use is linked to breast cancer in women with mutated BRCA1
gene.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shari Roan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Questions about the link between breast cancer and birth control
pills have lingered for years.</LD>
<LD>   To date, research has shown only a slight increase in breast
cancer risk among younger women who take oral contraceptives. And two
years ago, a study indicated that only women who took pills made
before 1975, when the estrogen content of pills was much higher, are
at increased risk.</LD>
<LD>   A study released last week, however, offers the first strong
evidence that a subset of women are at increased risk for breast
cancer if they take even today's lower-estrogen pills.</LD>
<TE>   The report, in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, found
that women who carry a BRCA1 gene mutation and use oral
contraceptives for five or more years have a 33% increased risk of
early-onset breast cancer, compared with those who have the mutation
and never used the pill. The risk was greatest for women younger than
30. Breast cancer that occurs earlier in a woman's life is associated
with more severe disease.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers did not find a link between breast cancer and pill use
for those with BRCA2 gene mutations, although they called for more
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   About 1 million U.S. women carry the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene
mutations. Women with the mutations have a 50% to 80% lifetime risk
of having breast cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The research further underscores the benefits of knowing whether
one carries the BRCA gene mutations. "The gene was found in 1994, and
we've been offering testing since 1996. But most carriers in the
United States don't know [their status] yet," said the study's lead
investigator, Dr. Steven A. Narod of the Sunnybrook and Women's
College Health Sciences Centre and the University of Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   The question of whether to take the pill is complicated for those
with mutated BRCA because women with either of the gene mutations
also have a 60% to 85% chance of developing ovarian cancer by age 70.
Studies show that oral contraceptive use may reduce the risk of
ovarian cancer by 30% to 50%.</TE>
<TE>   The new study suggests that taking the pill after age 30 is not
likely to increase the risk of breast cancer among BRCA1 users with
the mutated gene, and it can be used safely to reduce ovarian cancer
risk, Narod said. Younger women may be at higher risk for breast
cancer when taking the pill because their breast tissue is still
developing and could be more vulnerable to the estrogen in the pill,
he said. The data analyzed use of the pill among 1,311 women with
mutated BRCA who had breast cancer and 1,311 who did not.</TE>

<HD>Rituals and the healthy family</HD>
<DH>A review of 50 years of research concludes that routines
provide comfort and stability.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Benedict Carey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brother-in-law and family are stuffed into the guest room, the flu is
marching like the plague through the household and there's still a
dozen gifts to buy. As if anyone needs reminding: Holiday stress is
upon us.</LD>
<LD>   Yet so is holiday cheer, and as a new report finds, many family
rituals and routines -- from hectic holiday feasts to decorating the
Christmas tree or sending out cards -- provide stability and
emotional support, especially for children. The conclusions are based
on a review of 50 years of research on the effect of family dynamics
on mental and physical health.</LD>
<LD>   "Family rituals can be so subtle we don't even notice them," said
Barbara Fiese, a psychologist at Syracuse University in New York and
lead author of a report in the current issue of the Journal of Family
Psychology. "Simply the act of walking in the door after a day at
work, the way you greet people, the way kids or a spouse or the dog
comes up to meet you -- these can become an important ritual in a
family's daily life."</LD>
<TE>   Fiese and her colleagues analyzed 32 studies, including in-depth
investigations of families with young children, with adolescents and
with a single parent. In one series of studies, psychologists
followed families with at least one alcoholic parent.</TE>
<TE>   If these households had meals together, bedtime rituals and other
routines, children were less likely to develop drinking problems than
those living in chaotic, unstructured families.</TE>
<TE>   Children in families that sat down to dinner together three or
four times a week and who had weekend and holiday rituals tended to
do well in school and reported lower levels of anxiety than those in
families without such rituals.</TE>
<TE>   The Syracuse University review also noted that often the first
sign that a family is breaking apart is the disruption of rituals,
whether it's the Saturday morning trip to the doughnut shop or the
Sunday walk to church.</TE>
<TE>   If husband and wife do split, their children may be in even
greater need of these familiar touchstones. "They may work to protect
the children from some of the stresses associated with divorce,"
Fiese said.</TE>
<TE>   There are exceptions. When the entire burden of preparing a
holiday celebration falls on a single person -- say, the mother --
there may not be much reward for her. All the more reason, Fiese
said, to recruit help and make the preparation itself a ritual.</TE>
<TE>   "Either get help or cut back," she said. "One thing I suggest
families do is to sit down and ask how important to them the ritual
is. If it's important, you ought to be able to get some help."</TE>

<HD>Searching for a happiness strategy</HD>
<DH>The people who enjoy life tend to make the most of the
moment -- and their strengths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Benedict Carey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe there's a science to happiness. A set of principles we could
study, master, then apply to the disappointments, disasters and dirty
dishes in our own lives. Whether gloomy by nature or not, we'd at
least have some emotional hydraulics to lift ourselves out of despair
after the inevitable arguments at home, mess-ups at work, personal
insults. We might even learn how to enjoy ourselves and thrive doing
work we thought miserable.</LD>
<LD>   Martin Seligman, a professor of psychology at the University of
Pennsylvania, is determined to find the principles that underlie the
good life. Seligman is a driving force behind positive psychology,
the growing effort among sociologists, economists and other social
scientists to study how humans succeed, develop virtue and achieve
fulfillment.</LD>
<LD>   He has spent 20 years researching depression and his findings have
helped influence how therapists treat the condition. That background
gives Seligman the authority to talk about happiness without being
written off as a self-help guru or Pollyanna. His recently released
book, "Authentic Happiness" (Free Press), details the research
findings and how they apply to daily life.</LD>
<TE>   "I believe psychology has done very well in working out how to
understand and treat disease," Seligman said in a recent interview.
"But I think that is literally half-baked. If all you do is work to
fix problems, to alleviate suffering, then by definition you are
working to get people to zero, to neutral.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm saying is, 'Why not try to get them to plus-two, or
plus-three?' ... Even people in great pain want more than to merely
endure. They want the good things in life, just like the rest of us."</TE>
<TE>   Still much to discover</TE>
<TE>   As a field of study, positive psychology is a work in progress.
For one thing, as other psychologists have observed, most measures of
happiness are self-reported questionnaires, which can be difficult to
interpret. A person who calls herself "very happy" on a survey may or
may not be truly content. For another, the research has yet to
explore the positive qualities of universal emotional states such as
envy, regret and frustration.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of my patients would love to lift their moods," said Alan
Rappoport, a therapist in Menlo Park, Calif. "The problem is that
they're stuck. They know they ought to be able to learn to be happy;
they just can't yet get there."</TE>
<TE>   Seligman has tried to provide a blueprint. To make ourselves
happier, he argues, we need to learn two important skills: how to
mind our thoughts, moment to moment. And how to forget ourselves
altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Separating beliefs, facts</TE>
<TE>   In previous work, Seligman has described an effective technique
for countering what he refers to as "catastrophic thoughts." The
trick is first to recognize the despairing idea -- "I'm the weakest
employee in the department, and I'm probably going to get fired" --
and then check it against real evidence, as if the statement were
being uttered by another person trying to make you miserable. "Did
anyone actually say I was doing consistently poor work? So my last
project fell apart -- yet the one before that was praised highly.
Given the expectations, everyone in the department is struggling."</TE>
<TE>   By arguing with yourself in this way, Seligman has shown, you can
separate beliefs from facts, defusing many pessimistic assumptions by
editing them according to logic and evidence. In effect, you act as
your own therapist, talking hard sense to yourself precisely when
your thoughts begin to darken. The same kind of self-disputing can be
applied to almost any variety of gloominess.</TE>
<TE>   Psychologists find, for example, that depressed people often turn
small foibles and mistakes into stinging self-criticism. If they get
a bad grade, it's not because they didn't prepare: It's because
they're not very smart. If they lose a tennis match, it's time to
quit: They've never been athletic. If they actually win, or get a
good grade, it's all luck.</TE>
<TE>   In studies during the 1970s and 1980s, Seligman and other
investigators showed that depressed people who learn to recognize and
disarm this kind of reflexive pessimism and self-attacking can free
themselves of feelings of worthlessness, fatigue and other symptoms
of the condition. They are no longer depressed. They have pulled
themselves from the depths.</TE>
<TE>   Seligman argues that they can get to even higher ground, using
techniques that rely partly on the work of the Hungarian-born
psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a leading researcher in the
field of creativity. In experiments using moment-to-moment mood
monitoring, Csikszentmihalyi has shown that creatively successful
adults and teenagers tend to experience regular periods of what he
calls "flow."</TE>
<TE>   A widely recognized psychological state, flow is the total
absorption that occurs when people are involved in an activity for
its own sake, using their skills to solve a puzzle, complete a job or
play a game, whether tennis or chess. It's the equivalent of an
athlete being "in the zone" or a jazz player losing himself in a
melody. During "flow" moments one's ego and sense of time are set
aside. "People who are in flow don't really feel anything in the
moment," Csikszentmihalyi said, "but we have good evidence that
afterward they feel very satisfied. They think, 'Gee, that was
wonderful.' " Not surprisingly, people who love their jobs and their
families report high levels of flow and satisfaction, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Seligman maintains that the way to find more flow is to first
recognize our natural skills, what he calls "signature strengths." As
opposed to innate gifts, such as physical beauty or lightning
quickness, the strengths are moral qualities valued in almost all
cultures, including valor, originality, perseverance and more than a
dozen others. Each of us scores high in two or three of these
qualities, and it's when expressing them that we're most likely to
enter a state of flow, Seligman believes.</TE>
<TE>   Who can flow through a miserable job? Not everyone, perhaps.
Seligman, however, believes that even tedious work can be
"re-crafted" to allow for some flow. "Look at what hairdressers do,"
he said. "They change what could be a very menial job into something
they're really good at. These are people who would score very high on
social intelligence as a signature strength."</TE>
<TE>   Flow should not be mistaken for purpose. In the end, Seligman
says, there's deeper fulfillment in joining our signature strengths
to a larger cause, such as education, science, justice, religion.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence for this comes in part from surveys showing that
deeply religious people report high levels of life satisfaction and
mental health. They often demonstrate remarkable resilience in the
face of disease and disaster, such as the death of a loved one.</TE>
<TE>   Benefits of generosity</TE>
<TE>   In several recent experiments, psychologists have also
demonstrated that performing an act of generosity -- helping someone
with homework or writing a long letter to a dear friend -- provides
sensations of contentment that last measurably longer than a good
meal or a good movie.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it's not surprising that people who report being very
happy also have many good friends to write or call, as the Hope
College psychologist David Myers has shown.</TE>
<TE>   In short, research is beginning to confirm what many devoted
altruists have long maintained: that doing good feels very good.</TE>
<TE>   "The good life," writes Seligman, "consists in deriving happiness
by using your signature strengths every day in the main realms of
living. The meaningful life adds one more component: using these same
strengths to forward knowledge, power or goodness."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Martin Seligman's research suggests that each person has several
"signature strengths."</LD>
<LD>   Unlike natural abilities, such as physical strength or perfect
pitch, these strengths are moral or social qualities, such as
perseverance, integrity and valor.</LD>
<LD>   One way to find more fulfillment in life, he believes, is to use
our strengths as often as possible in daily life.</LD>
<TE>   Seligman has designed a questionnaire to help identify these
traits, asking how well certain statements describe our character.
Here's a selection from the survey:</TE>
<TE>   Answer whether the A statements are: very much like me (5 points);
like me (4 points); neutral (3); unlike me (2); or very much unlike
me (1). For the B statements, reverse the scoring, so that very much
like me is 1 point, and very much unlike me is 5 points.</TE>
<TE>   Curiosity:</TE>
<TE>   A) "I am always curious about the world."</TE>
<TE>   B) "I am easily bored."</TE>
<TE>   Originality:</TE>
<TE>   A ) "I like to think of new ways to do things."</TE>
<TE>   B) "Most of my friends are more imaginative than I am."</TE>
<TE>   Bravery:</TE>
<TE>   A) "I have taken frequent stands in the face of strong
opposition."</TE>
<TE>   B) "Pain and disappointment often get the better of me."</TE>
<TE>   Spirituality:</TE>
<TE>   A) "My life has a strong purpose."</TE>
<TE>   B) "I do not have a calling in life."</TE>
<TE>   Humor:</TE>
<TE>   A) "I always mix work and play as much as possible."</TE>
<TE>   B) "I rarely say funny things."</TE>
<TE>   Kindness:</TE>
<TE>   A) "I have voluntarily helped a neighbor in the last month."</TE>
<TE>   B) "I am rarely as excited about the good fortune of others as I
am about my own."</TE>
<TE>   Leadership:</TE>
<TE>   A) "I can always get people to do things together without nagging
them."</TE>
<TE>   B) "I am not very good at planning group activities."</TE>
<TE>   Humility:</TE>
<TE>   A) "I change the subject when people pay me compliments."</TE>
<TE>   B) "I often talk about my accomplishments."</TE>
<TE>   Scores of 9 or 10 in any specific category will usually identify
one of our strengths, though not always, Seligman says.</TE>

<HD>Caution over much-touted test</HD>
<DH>The quick, new blood screening for stroke and heart disease
could save lives, but some experts say there are several caveats to
keep in mind.</DH>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new blood test that may be a better predictor of heart disease and
stroke than cholesterol measures catapulted into the headlines
recently after a study in the New England Journal of Medicine. The
test measures levels of an inflammatory substance, C-reactive
protein, that plays a role in cardiovascular disease.</LD>
<LD>   So, should you ask for the CRP test? Probably. It's cheap -- about
$16 -- and already on the market. And it might save your life,
especially if a worrisome result gets you to exercise more and eat
less. President Bush took the test and passed with flying colors, so
perhaps it's good enough for the rest of us.</LD>
<LD>   An editorial last week in the New England Journal of Medicine took
a more cautious view, arguing that "it may be premature" to adopt
widespread screening for C-reactive protein.</LD>
<TE>   And there are legitimate caveats. No one is recommending that the
test be done routinely for all adults. The experts -- a committee of
specialists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
the American Heart Assn. -- are still hashing out who should get it,
and a decision is expected soon. If these experts do recommend
testing, it may be a limited endorsement, say, for people whose risk
is unclear or moderate based on other diagnostic measures. CRP
testing would not replace, but rather supplement, cholesterol
screening.</TE>
<TE>   A concern of any screening test is that worrisome results could
set you on a path of intervention that may do harm as well as good.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, if your CRP test is high, do you just exercise more
and eat less? Or do you start taking statin drugs, which can lower
CRP as well as cholesterol? The evidence that statins lower CRP is
growing, but it's not conclusive, and statins do carry some risk.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, once CRP testing is used more widely, in the real world,
it may prove not to be such an accurate predictor of heart disease as
it was in research labs. After all, cholesterol has not been a
foolproof predictor: Half of people who have heart attacks have
normal cholesterol.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, much of the work on CRP, including the latest study, has
been done by researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital, which owns
the patents on inflammatory markers for cardiovascular disease. This
does not taint the research. But CRP testing is a potentially
lucrative business.</TE>
<TE>   That said, the new study, which confirms a considerable body of
previous work, seems likely to change the way doctors screen for
heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   Led by Dr. Paul Ridker, director of cardiovascular disease
prevention at Brigham and Women's, the new study followed 27,939
healthy middle-aged women for eight years to assess their risk of
having a first heart attack, stroke, cardiac bypass surgery or death
from cardiovascular causes.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers found, as expected, that women with high levels of
both CRP and LDL cholesterol were at high risk of cardiovascular
problems, and that women with low levels on both tests were at low
risk. The surprise was the women in the middle.</TE>
<TE>   In the study, women with high CRP but low cholesterol actually
were at higher risk than those with high cholesterol and low CRP,
even though the former group is usually deemed low risk by current
screening.</TE>
<TE>   "The CRP story gets more interesting every day," says Dr. Sidney
Smith, chief scientific officer for the American Heart Assn. and
professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill. "The evidence for its value is compelling, but not as a
replacement for cholesterol."</TE>
<TE>   For years, doctors have known that cholesterol-filled plaques in
artery walls pose a significant danger. If these plaques completely
block an artery, the heart can be deprived -- sometimes fatally -- of
adequate blood flow.</TE>
<TE>   But doctors also know that even if plaques don't completely block
an artery, they can trigger heart attacks if they rupture, releasing
blood clots that themselves can block an artery to the heart or
brain.</TE>
<TE>   Most heart attacks are actually caused by smaller, "vulnerable"
plaques at risk of rupture, says Dr. James Muller, a cardiologist at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   So far, vulnerable plaques, which are filled with inflammatory
cells from the immune system, cannot be detected with standard
imaging techniques such as coronary angiograms or CT scans.</TE>
<TE>   Enter C-reactive protein, a substance made in the liver and
released during infections. Standard CRP tests are used routinely to
gauge the degree of inflammatory response in everything from
pneumonia to rheumatoid arthritis.</TE>
<TE>   But new, more sensitive cardiac CRP test measures tiny
fluctuations at the low end of the range. (A worrisome score on the
new test could indicate nothing worse than a common cold; but if a
repeat test several weeks later is still high, it may indicate a
persistent inflammation in the body, including fragile, inflamed
plaques.)</TE>
<TE>   Still, not everyone believes CRP testing is ready for prime time,
or that, even if it is, doctors should begin prescribing statins for
this reason. Key questions remain, including whether the humble
aspirin, an anti-inflammatory as well as anti-clotting drug, might
also be used to lower CRP levels.</TE>
<TE>   Still, CRP is the most promising advance in a long time in
detecting cardiovascular risk. It makes sense to ask your doctor
about it.</TE>

<HD>Echinacea stirs up the immune system</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometime in the late 19th century, both Europeans and North Americans
realized that the herb echinacea was a medicinal gift from nature. In
1919, noted anthropologist Melvin Gilmore remarked in a study of the
Plains Indians that "echinacea seems to have been used as a remedy
for more ailments than any other plant." A member of the sunflower
family, echinacea remains a popular herb. Nine species are found in
North America, but only three (E. pallida, E. angustifolia and E.
purpurea) have been found to have healing properties.</LD>
<LD>   Uses: Echinacea's roots, leaves and flowers were used by Indians
for bee stings and snake bites. Contemporary use of the herb has
focused on its ability to stimulate the immune system.</LD>
<LD>   Dose: In tablet form, typically 1,000 milligrams a day.</LD>
<TE>   Precautions: Echinacea could interfere with drugs used to suppress
the immune system, such as those used by people who have had organ
transplants. People with HIV also should avoid the herb because
stimulating the immune system may stimulate the virus. People with
lupus, in which the immune system doesn't function properly,
shouldn't take echinacea because stimulating the immune system could
aggravate the condition. Allergic reactions to echinacea are
possible, especially among people with ragweed allergies.</TE>
<TE>   Research: Studies of echinacea's effects on the common cold have
been mixed. That could be because preparations vary widely, and
researchers don't know which species, and which parts of the plant,
are superior. A government study is addressing that question. Another
study is examining whether echinacea given to children ages 2 to 11
shortens the duration of upper respiratory infections and prevents
bacterial infections.</TE>
<TE>   Dietary supplement makers are not required by the U.S. government
to demonstrate that their products are safe or effective. Ask your
health-care provider for advice on selecting a brand.</TE>

<HD>Adult tonsillitis: Nothing to kid about</HD>
<DH>Infections can cause painful flare-ups that surgery can
eliminate. But the procedure is a lot tougher on grown-ups than
children, doctors warn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Diane Hamilton was a grown-up battling a child's ailment. At least
that's what she thought. But the high fever, aches, chills -- and a
pair of tonsils that felt as big as pingpong balls -- amounted to
much more than a passing case of tonsillitis.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a little embarrassing," said Hamilton, a 33-year-old
architect. "I kept thinking, 'I'm an adult. This shouldn't be
happening.' "</LD>
<LD>   Initially, she didn't bother seeing a doctor, treating the
symptoms with over-the-counter medications and rest. But after a
third flare-up in as many months, the Cambridge, Mass., resident
finally made an appointment. The physician suspected strep throat,
but the test came back negative. It took three more infections over
the next three months before the diagnosis of viral tonsillitis was
finally made.</LD>
<TE>   With viral tonsillitis, antibiotics are ineffective and the
episodes usually last from four to six days. If it's the bacterial
variety, an untreated bout can last from 10 to 14 days; antibiotics
usually clear it up in five to seven days.</TE>
<TE>   "It would flare up whenever I felt very stressed or really run
down," said Hamilton, who missed nine workdays over a six-month
period because of the condition. "So, I guess I must have been
feeling pretty stressed and run down then."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors suspect the number of adults with chronic tonsillitis is
on the rise, if for no other reason than more grown-ups still have an
intact pair of the oval-shaped lymphoid tissue masses at the back of
their throats. Until the early 1970s, tonsillectomies were routinely
performed on children who showed signs of tonsil infection. However,
by the early 1980s, physicians were balking at tonsil removal in all
but the severest cases.</TE>
<TE>   It's still uncertain precisely what function tonsils serve, but
doctors believe they are part of the body's immune system --
gatekeepers that provide germ protection at the entrance to the
breathing passages. But as many have discovered at some point,
usually before the age of 10, the tonsils can easily become
overwhelmed with infection.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to fever and chills, tonsillitis can cause bad breath
and difficulties swallowing and breathing, particularly during sleep.
Although Hamilton was spared these symptoms, her options were fairly
limited. She could either tolerate the condition, which could erupt
at any time, or have the tonsils surgically removed.</TE>
<TE>   "After so many infections in such a short period, the decision for
me was pretty clear," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Because the operation is often associated with children, adult
patients are sometimes falsely lulled into believing the procedure is
no big deal. Wrong, say doctors, who note that children are more
resilient than adults.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell patients it's going to be easy on me and hard on you,"
said Dr. Neil Bhattacharyya, who tracked 83 chronic tonsillitis
sufferers in a study spanning three years at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston. "I tell them they are going to have the worst
sore throat of their life."</TE>
<TE>   But Bhattacharyya's study, which was published in the November
issue of Annals of Otology, Rhinology and Laryngology, found that
among adult sufferers of chronic tonsillitis, those who opt for
surgery subsequently take fewer sick days and less medication than
those who keep their tonsils. Before the tonsillectomies, the study
found, patients averaged nearly seven weeks on antibiotics and about
six doctor visits per year. After the surgery, antibiotic use for the
same patients plummeted to an average of one day, while doctor visits
dropped to an average of 0.3 per year.</TE>
<TE>   "The myth persists that if you're an adult, you shouldn't have
your tonsils removed," said Bhattacharyya. "But for people who get
tonsillitis several times a year, the surgery makes sense."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors don't know why some patients are more prone to chronic
tonsillitis than others. But they do know its telltale symptom, which
usually distinguishes it from other throat ailments -- swollen,
discolored, even yellowish, tonsils.</TE>
<TE>   Bhattacharyya cautions that the surgery isn't for everyone. If the
condition flares up only once in a while or the size of the tonsils
is very small, other treatments are probably better.</TE>
<TE>   If you decide on surgery, which costs about $2,500, prepare for a
bumpy recovery. Hamilton took twice the customary weeklong recovery
time to return to normal after the 30-minute, outpatient procedure,
she said. Her troubles started immediately after surgery, when she
reacted poorly to the anesthesia. She was sick for four hours,
whereas most patients, if they get sick at all from the anesthesia,
are over it within an hour.</TE>
<TE>   The coming days were hardly better. Medications did little to
alleviate the severe pain she felt swallowing. For at least a week,
her diet consisted solely of Popsicles. (Ice cream was out because as
a dairy product it promotes mucous, which irritates the throat.)</TE>
<TE>   But in the nearly three years since the procedure, she hasn't had
any similar illnesses, not even a sore throat, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I travel a lot for my job, and I just couldn't live with it
anymore," Hamilton said. "I don't miss my tonsils."</TE>

<HD>Targeting the Social Drinker Is Just MADD</HD>
<DH>To save lives, go after speeders, cell phone users and
heavy drinkers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Radley Balko</AU>
<BD>Radley Balko is a columnist for FoxNews.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The percentage of traffic fatalities caused by drunk drivers has
dropped more than 40% since 1982, and the number of people killed by
drunk drivers has leveled off at 16,000 a year. During that period,
anti-alcohol advocacy has become something of a niche nonprofit
industry. Now, instead of focusing on rounding up real threats to
highway safety -- the hard drinkers -- groups like Mothers Against
Drunk Driving have decided to wage war on social drinkers.</LD>
<LD>   In fairness, MADD deserves credit for raising awareness of the
dangers of driving while intoxicated. It was almost certainly MADD's
dogged efforts to spark public debate that effected the drop in
fatalities since 1980, when Candy Lightner founded the group after
her daughter was killed by a drunk driver.</LD>
<LD>   But MADD is at heart a bureaucracy, a big one. It boasts an annual
budget of $45 million, $12 million of which pays for salaries,
pensions and benefits. Bureaucracies don't change easily, even when
the problems they were created to address change.</LD>
<TE>   In its eight-point plan to "jump-start the stalled war on drunk
driving," MADD advocates the use of highly publicized but random
roadblocks to find drivers who have been drinking. Even setting aside
the civil liberties implications, these checkpoints do little to get
dangerous drunks off the road. Rather, they instill fear in people
who have a glass of wine with dinner, a beer at a ballgame or a toast
at a retirement party.</TE>
<TE>   In most jurisdictions, even a slight amount of alcohol detected in
a Breathalyzer test at such checkpoints can be grounds for arrest for
driving under the influence -- a less serious charge than driving
while intoxicated but one that still carries social stigma and other
consequences.</TE>
<TE>   One point in MADD's plan advocates raising excise taxes on beer.
Interestingly, MADD refrains from calling for an added tax on
distilled spirits, an industry that the organization has partnered
with on various drunk driving awareness projects. And MADD has made
no secret of its desire to lower the legal blood- alcohol level from
the current .08 in most places to .06, .04 or even to zero. This
despite studies showing that most alcohol-caused traffic fatalities
involved drivers with a level of 0.14 or higher.</TE>
<TE>   The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration asserts
that fatality rates don't rise appreciably until a driver hits 0.10.
Still, MADD champions a threshold of .08 or lower, a standard under
which a 120-pound person who had two glasses of wine in two hours
would be seen as drunk.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, there is little in MADD's plan that would improve traffic
safety. A British study found that cell phone use while driving
caused significantly more impairment than a .08 blood-alcohol level.
And a 2001 American Automobile Assn. study found that eating,
fumbling with a car stereo or CD player or disciplining children
while driving are even more dangerous than cell phone use.</TE>
<TE>   "Defining down" what constitutes drunk driving serves MADD by
exaggerating just how many drunk people get behind the wheel.
Inflated drunk driving statistics confirm MADD's relevance and help
it raise money. Whether these new "drunks" actually are dangerous is
beside the point.</TE>
<TE>   Just last month, MADD issued a highly publicized grade of C for
U.S. efforts to curb drunk driving. It cited increases in
"alcohol-related traffic deaths" as its explanation for the low
grade. The language that MADD used is important. "Alcohol-related"
statistics include every accident in which someone involved had
something to drink. That includes, for example, accidents in which a
sober driver runs a red light and strikes a driver who had two beers
and those in which a drunk stumbles out of a bar and into the path of
a bus.</TE>
<TE>   MADD regularly overlooks highway safety measures unrelated to
alcohol when it is politically convenient. General Motors, for
example, promised to give MADD $2.5 million over five years. Is it a
coincidence that MADD is silent when GM glorifies speed in its
marketing campaigns?</TE>
<TE>   According to the Center for Consumer Freedom, an advocacy group
for restaurants and taverns, even Lightner has reservations about
MADD's new focus. "I worry that the movement I helped found has lost
direction," the center's Web site quotes Lightner as saying. "If we
really want to save lives, let's go after the most dangerous drivers
on the road." Speeders, for instance, or cell phone users, or those
who drink themselves into near comas. But rather than focus on the
real problems now, MADD has chosen to play Chicken Little, to
manipulate data and to advocate public policies that come close to
neo-Prohibition.</TE>

<HD>Universal Coverage Will Take Universal Sacrifice</HD>
<DH></DH>

Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. Web site:

<DL></DL>
<LD>Universal health-care reform is back in vogue, but it will take
sacrifice by every stakeholder in health care to achieve it.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Blue Shield CEO Bruce Bodaken called on California to
enact a law mandating that every resident have health insurance; this
would be done through a tax and by requiring that large employers
provide coverage and that those who can afford insurance buy it.
Labor unions and doctors are seeking state legislation requiring
employers to pay for employees' coverage or pay a tax that covers the
uninsured. Nurses and progressives are backing a bill to create a
Canadian-style universal health-care system.</LD>
<LD>   The problem with getting universal coverage in the U.S. has always
been the politics, not the policy. Insuring everyone is indisputably
the most cost-effective system, because everyone pays less when all
are insured; also, sickness is dealt with when it is cheapest to
treat.</LD>
<TE>   The politics that have doomed reforms have pitted insured against
uninsured, patient against provider, employer against employee. The
hope for a new political dynamic arises because the system is so
broken that only radical change can save any one group.</TE>
<TE>   California town hall meetings among key stakeholders produced
three points of consensus about the problem: First, there is enough
money in the health-care system to insure everyone, but it is being
mismanaged. Second, cost inefficiencies in the market-based system
are devastating all stakeholders except insurers, HMOs and drug
companies. And third, more public control is needed for greater
cost-efficiency and to coordinate the disparate public and private
health-care delivery systems.</TE>
<TE>   To reach a solution, the key players each have to give up
something.</TE>
<TE>   * Labor unions: Employers have responded to higher insurance
premiums by limiting or eliminating employee health-care benefits. As
a result, unions want to mandate that employers pay for insurance
benefits. In this, they have common cause with insurers who would
like nothing better than for every employer to have to buy their
product. Rather than form a politically convenient alliance with
insurers, labor must insist on cost-efficiency from them.</TE>
<TE>   Labor also wants to retain insurance as an employer-based benefit
because it is a bargaining chip. Unions should be open to moving the
benefit away from the employer if that is in the best public policy
interest of uninsured workers.</TE>
<TE>   * Hospitals: Many good hospitals are withering due to insufficient
and unstable payments from government and insurers. Some hospital
chains, however, have been profiteering by working the system. In
exchange for more stable payments, hospitals should agree to submit
to a public process that determines standardized rates.</TE>
<TE>   * Doctors: Some ethical doctors have been driven out of California
by unethical HMO rules and insufficient payments, while some
physician-run medical groups have made a killing. Physicians should
open their books and allow the state to set fair reimbursement rates
for all care.</TE>
<TE>   * Nurses: The state's largest nurses union has been one of the
most ardent advocates for a Canadian-style health-care system, but it
should consider another model if it can achieve similar
cost-efficiency and limits on profit while being politically more
palatable.</TE>
<TE>   * Employers: Businesses have been hit with huge premium increases,
but their fear of government bureaucrats has been greater than their
fear of insurance bureaucrats. However, government regulation can
hold down their premiums while protecting employee benefits.
Employers must break ranks with an HMO lobby whose main solution for
controlling costs has been cutting coverage.</TE>
<TE>   * Insurers/HMOs: Insurers must agree to limits on profits and to
strict government regulation of premiums and coverage.</TE>
<TE>   * Patients: The middle class and upper class must recognize that
the cure for unaffordable or unavailable health coverage is to
support a plan that insures everyone.</TE>
<TE>   While not all stakeholders will agree, the only hope for reform is
that a critical mass will. An important measure of Gov. Gray Davis'
leadership will be whether he locks the right people in the right
room at the right time.</TE>

<HD>End the Nuclear Double Standard for India</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Selig S. Harrison</AU>
<BD>Selig S. Harrison is a senior scholar of the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars and director of the Asia
program at the Center for International Policy.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>India and Pakistan are both nuclear powers. But Pakistan has exported
uranium enrichment technology to North Korea in exchange for
missiles, while India has refused to sell nuclear weapons know-how to
any other state. Despite India's consistent record of honoring
international nonproliferation norms, the United States clings to an
increasingly obsolete policy that bans U.S. civilian nuclear
cooperation with New Delhi. At the same time, Washington permits such
cooperation with China, even though Beijing has transferred nuclear
and missile technology to Pakistan and Iran.</LD>
<LD>   The ban is a relic of past decades when the United States was
pressing India not to become a nuclear power. Now that New Delhi has
joined the nuclear club, Washington needs to reshape its policies.</LD>
<LD>   Strategically, U.S. policy is now based on the implicit premise
that Asia is more stable with India having a minimum nuclear
deterrent than with China enjoying a nuclear monopoly. It no longer
makes sense to refuse U.S. cooperation in making Indian civilian
nuclear reactors safer and to bar U.S. companies from selling
civilian reactors to India, as they do to China.</LD>
<TE>   With 14 operating civilian nuclear reactors that produce
electricity, and more on the way, India is anxious to avoid a nuclear
disaster like the one at Chernobyl in Ukraine and has periodically
asked the U.S. to help ensure the safety of its nuclear
installations. Washington has invariably said no, citing U.S.
legislative restrictions that resulted from India's failure to sign
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, or NPT, in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, however, the Bush administration opened the door
slightly to a possible policy reappraisal. The chairman of the U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Richard Meserve, will meet in January
with Indian Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Anil Kakodkar. The
White House approved the visit to India after a bitter interagency
struggle in which NPT "strict constructionists" tried to block the
trip. A compromise was finally reached permitting Meserve to have a
"dialogue" but not to arrange actual transfers of nuclear safety
technology.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. rationale for discriminating in favor of China at the
expense of India on this issue is based on legalistic hairsplitting.
Because China had tested nuclear weapons in 1964, it was classified
as a "nuclear weapons state" under the treaty and eligible to sign
the NPT, along with the other powers then possessing nuclear weapons.
Other states were barred in perpetuity from the nuclear club and
asked to forswear nuclear weapons formally by signing the treaty.
India branded the NPT as discriminatory and refused to sign. Now it
wants to sign as a nuclear weapons state, but the U.S. will not
agree.</TE>
<TE>   The NPT does not bar its signatories from providing nuclear
technology to nonsignatories such as India. However, the U.S.
Congress went beyond the treaty with a law barring nonsignatories
from receiving U.S. nuclear technology even if they accepted
International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards on its use. This
legislation specifically bars the U.S. from helping India to make its
reactors safer.</TE>
<TE>   In return for access to U.S. civilian nuclear technology, the U.S.
should impose two conditions, at minimum, on India. First, New Delhi
would have to accept the international agency's safeguards not only
on any new reactors purchased but also on all its existing civilian
nuclear reactors, as it says it is ready to do. Second, India would
have to make some form of binding commitment not to export nuclear
technology, formalizing its de facto policy.</TE>
<TE>   Significantly, Hans Blix, the former International Atomic Energy
Agency director now heading the U.N. inspection team in Iraq, two
years ago endorsed the idea of liberalizing civilian nuclear sales to
both India and Pakistan -- but with a third, tougher condition. Both
would have to freeze their stockpiles of fissile material under
intrusive agency safeguards that would block diversion of reactors
from civilian to military use.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing in the NPT that would stand in the way of such
an arrangement," Blix told a Stockholm seminar. When Blix made this
suggestion, Pakistan's secret nuclear transfers to North Korea had
not been exposed. It's unlikely he would advocate civilian nuclear
sales to Islamabad now. But his proposal is more relevant than ever
in the case of India. The administration should follow up the Meserve
visit with a cooperative nuclear safety program as the prelude to a
broader dialogue designed to strengthen India's demonstrated
commitment to nonproliferation.</TE>

<HD>America to Enron: We'd Like to Buy a Vowel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bruce Kluger</AU>
<BD>Bruce Kluger writes satire for National Public Radio.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans -- never a gang to shy from the delicate art of
grave-picking -- proved themselves to be savvy holiday shoppers last
week by grabbing up vestiges of the bankrupt Enron Corp. at auction.
In the second of three planned white sales, an avalanche of items was
put on the block, then flew off the shelves at bargain rates: Fancy
office furniture went for a song, as did computer equipment, 60-inch
plasma TVs, even a foosball table.</LD>
<LD>   But the most prized lot among collectors was a handful of Enron
logo sculptures -- featuring the now-infamous tilted E (or, as some
have smirkingly labeled it, "the crooked E").</LD>
<LD>   A computer store employee bought a 5-by-5-foot stainless steel E
that stood guard outside an Enron branch office, paying $44,000; a
Houston chemist snagged a similar E for $10,000; and an unidentified
guy in a silver Ferrari snapped up the disco version of the letter --
a rotating black E whose colorful neons once lighted up Enron's lobby
-- for 33 grand.</LD>
<TE>   Although I'm confident that these alphabetical artifacts will make
delightful conversation pieces, perhaps Enron could have burnished
what remains of its stained image by not selling these items but
instead donating them to those who really need a giant E in their
lives, such as:</TE>
<TE>   * eBay: Currently the world's premiere online auction company,
eBay successfully survived the bubble burst that vanquished most of
the e-traders, e-tailers and mixed e-nuts that once crowded the
electronic corridors of the Internet. Now that it's playing in the
big leagues, however, shouldn't eBay -- little e, big B is the
company's style -- finally reward itself with a big E? Little boys
ultimately graduate to long pants, after all; and it's not as though
corporate logos don't adapt to changing times. The New England
Patriots snazzed up their helmets and won the Super Bowl; Coca-Cola
hopes to boost sales by adding condensation bubbles to its classic
red-and-white ribbon insignia. Similarly, wouldn't eBay command more
authority as EBay? Just call it a simple typeface lift.</TE>
<TE>   * President Bush: One thing that really bothers me about our
president is his inability to pronounce the word "nuclear" correctly.
Instead, he proudly says "nuke-yoo-lar," a flagrant error that would
rattle me whoever the speaker might be but is doubly disturbing when
spoken by the guy who's got his finger on the button. Still, if
someone from the White House could arrange to install one of the
leftover Enron E's directly adjacent to Bush's desk in the Oval
Office, perhaps it would serve as a subtle reminder to the president
that the correct pronunciation is "nuke-LEE-ar." (Or, to paraphrase
"The Music Man," "it's a capital E and that rhymes with 'lee' and
that stands for boom.")</TE>
<TE>   * Public education: Face it, the American school system isn't
getting any better, as grade-point averages and classroom attendance
drop faster than Al Roker's pants size. But we're wasting time trying
to slow this academic free fall by tinkering with standardized tests
and dubious voucher programs. Instead, why not update the classic
grading system -- the old A, B, C, D, F formula -- by adding another
letter to the lineup? I think high schoolers would thrive if
permitted one more level of poor performance (marked by a leaning E)
before flunking out entirely.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, using the real Enron fiasco as a model, teachers would
simply suspend tilted-E students, and perhaps even offer them
severance packages. And if this helped nudge the nation's school
system back on course, maybe we could then bring in ex-Arthur
Andersen executives to teach the kids the new math.</TE>
<TE>   * Eminem: I've always assumed that the reason I never listen to
Eminem is because 1) I'm 46 years old, and 2) I despise rap music.
Yet on further reflection, maybe the reason the potty-mouthed rap
master leaves me cold is because his name just lies there, flatter
than the notes he croaks out between expletives. But maybe if Eminem
began his name with that familiar cockeyed E, I'd be curious enough
to give a few of his disks a spin. Indeed, such a transformation
might persuade Eminem himself to imbue his lyrics with more pointed
social commentary, perhaps even about corporate corruption in America
today. After all, no one at Enron seems interested in taking the rap.</TE>

<LD>Thank you for printing Robert Redford's Dec. 2 commentary, "The
Highest Patriotism Lies in Weaning U.S. From Fossil Fuels." I don't
have a flag on my lawn, but I do have a solar-generating facility on
the roof of my house that generates an average of 400 kilowatt-hours
per month. I never thought of it as a political statement, but I'll
certainly add that to the many reasons for having solar or wind
power. More and more people are installing solar, but most of the
public remains unaware.</LD>
<LD>   Along with the joy of watching the electric meter spin backward is
the knowledge that having a personal solar or wind generator makes
one independent of the pricing and manipulation of the power and fuel
market. Couple an electric vehicle, solar power and solar water
heating and you get a real independence from the oil barons abroad
and in our own country. This is not far-out futuristic thinking. It
is now. Practical-thinking "patriots" are helping to reduce the need
for wars to secure oil.</LD>

<LD>The debate about whether the campaign finance laws constrain free
speech is only half the story (Dec. 5). The advocates of repeal imply
that they have the money but can't be heard because of these laws.
But what happens if you don't have the necessary funds to buy your
way into some serious face time with those in office? How do your
concerns get heard? Does this debate underscore what many have been
saying for a long time -- if you don't pay, you don't get a chance to
have a say?</LD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Perlmutter's Dec. 4 commentary on college misbehavior, "Teacher
Dilemma: Sued If You Do, Sued If You Don't," was the sort of
silliness that gives academia a bad name. Perlmutter claims that
colleges are "scared off by the prospects of litigation" from telling
students how to behave. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Colleges still have behavioral codes, and I have never heard of an
institution being sued for enforcing a reasonable code.</LD>
<LD>   To the contrary, it is common to hear of students being punished
for the same things that would get them in trouble were they off
campus.</LD>
<LD>   The ridiculousness of the entire in loco parentis [in the place of
the parents] concept is highlighted by the fact that there is no
similar eagerness to police the private behavior of young people who
do not go to college. Would Perlmutter have us believe that enrolling
in a university somehow makes young people incapable of responsible
behavior? If not, why does he think such paternalism is necessary?</LD>
<TE>   What Perlmutter is really whining about is the fact that he is not
allowed to tell students in minute detail how to run their lives.
Based on the evidence of his commentary, I can imagine few people
less qualified for that task.</TE>

universities have to treat them as little children? Parents should
not be allowed to sue the universities because their child made a
stupid mistake; they should blame themselves for not bringing up
their children to behave well on their own.</TE>
<TE>   I'm 17, and if I make a mistake my parents hold me responsible for
it, not whoever was supposed to watch me. Hey, college kids, if you
can't take care of yourselves, move back home.</TE>

<HD>Spending by Both Rich and Poor Provides Jobs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Regan DuCasse (letter, Dec. 4) asks, "Do the poor provide jobs, as
the rich do?" The answer is yes. Most certainly! Every time people,
rich or poor, walk into a store and buy a product, they are helping
to provide jobs. When they go to a movie, buy dinner at McDonald's,
clothes at Wal-Mart, dog food at 7-Eleven ... they are providing
employment. Employment for workers. For shippers. For the wholesaler
and retailer. For clerks and accountants and janitors and, yes, for
chief executives as well. The poor may not spend much. But unlike the
rich with their 401(k)s and IRAs and T-bills, they spend nearly every
dime they make.</LD>
<LD>   Contrary to popular belief, money does not trickle down. It
trickles up. As long as the so-called poor have an opportunity to
earn a living, the rich need not worry where their own money comes
from. America was never in better shape than in the 20 years after
World War II when simple jobs paid decent wages. More homes were
sold, more cars were bought and more mothers got to stay at home with
their kids. And funny, the rich seemed to be doing OK despite 75%
income taxes.</LD>

<LD>Re "It's a Grand Old Party for Thurmond as He Turns 100 and Leaves
the Senate," Dec. 5: It's good to know that when one of our
legislators becomes so infirm that he has to be held up to vote in
Congress, his fellow members are willing to do this for him, as they
did for Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.). When he is housed in a suite at
Walter Reed Army Hospital, taxpayers are willing to pay for his keep.</LD>
<LD>   What a health insurance plan! How can I get one of these? The
many, many people in this country without health insurance should be
interested in the health care their Congress is entitled to and they
are not. Business as usual? I think not. Business for Congress is
better than usual.</LD>

<TE>   The use of the words "Grand Old Party" in conjunction with the
name Strom Thurmond is a total distortion of the facts. Thurmond
hated the ideals of Abraham Lincoln and the GOP. The senator from
South Carolina did not serve America. He served his ambitious
personal needs and the Old Confederacy. He never was, nor will he
ever be, a statesman.</TE>
<TE>   Thurmond is a racial rabble-rouser and has been called a woeful
womanizer. Political analyst Ferrel Guillory is right. We should not
ignore his history.</TE>

<LD>Re "Israeli Army Investigates Shooting of a Palestinian Matriarch,"
Dec. 4: A 95-year-old Palestinian great-grandmother, Fatima Hassan,
was shot and killed by an Israeli soldier near Ramallah. The
announcement by the Israel Defense Forces of an investigation of the
incident at the highest levels sounds encouraging, but talk of any
such investigation is a fantasy.</LD>
<LD>   A few weeks ago, while walking peacefully in a Palestinian olive
grove, I was viciously attacked and robbed at gunpoint by a gang of
young thugs from an illegal Israeli settlement near Nablus. Also
attacked and beaten was James Delaplain, a 74-year-old Wisconsin
grandfather. This attack took place under the watchful eyes of
Israeli soldiers who were under orders to protect Palestinians and
international peace workers as we attempted to harvest olives on
Palestinian land.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli police who investigated indicated they knew who the
troublemakers at the Itamar settlement were and promised to do
everything possible to apprehend and prosecute the punks. Later, the
police chief said it was too bad we didn't have photographs of our
attackers. (My camera was stolen from me, along with my passport,
plane ticket and all my money.) The execution of Hassan will not be
investigated, and murders like hers will continue unabated so long as
the U.S. continues to finance and support Israel's brutal ethnic
cleansing campaign.</LD>

<TE>   Yossi Klein Halevi's notion of an "outdated domination theology"
is commendable, but he is incorrect in presuming it to be the sole
property of Islam (Commentary, Dec. 4). Christianity, in addition to
its threats of hell, exerts its so-called morality in the political
arena (reproductive rights, Pledge of Allegiance); there's also
Judaic politics and money that subsidize the Zionist theocracy at the
expense of the American taxpayer. Fundamentalism is available in all
flavors.</TE>
<TE>   After millenniums of suffering at the hands of organized religion,
and countless wars and deaths over "holy land," why are we repeating
an ancient historical lesson? The holy texts and histories of all
three of these religions document the dominator agenda they have in
common. How about thinking for ourselves for a while?</TE>

<TE>   Re William McCall's Dec. 4 letter blaming Israel for the Nov. 28
terrorist attack in Kenya: Since when does one country's actions
justify the killing of innocents a continent away? May I remind him
that there were more Kenyans killed in the bomb blast than Israelis?
If one feels that Ariel Sharon is the sole cause of all Middle East
ills, then the only person to blame is Yasser Arafat. If he had not
walked away from Camp David and incited an uprising, Israelis would
have never felt compelled to elect Sharon. Arafat's actions -- and
inactions -- have put Sharon in the high chair, have kept his
approval ratings up and will certainly reelect him Jan. 28.</TE>

<LD>I am writing as a former colleague of Quincy Troupe at UC San Diego
("Poet Resigns Post at UC San Diego Over Resume Lie," Dec. 4). I am,
like him, a poet and writer. I was the head for the writing section
in the literature department where he taught for many years. Like
him, I was tenured from the day of my arrival there, even though I
did not have a bachelor of arts degree. I dropped out of Stanford in
1961, a year early, when students were becoming radicalized and
disaffected from most confirmed institutions. I never went back to
finish. It is important for people to remember that there was a time
when progressive politics dominated our thinking as young people and
we followed the call South and elsewhere, leaving behind some sloppy
trails. It is frightening to read the judgments coming down in this
cultural climate. They can't be separated.</LD>

failed to mention two horrifying incidents of civilian airliners shot
down by shoulder-fired missiles: two Air Rhodesia Viscount airliners
shot down by Marxist fighters using SA-7 missiles during the
Rhodesian civil war in the late '70s. One plane crashed with all on
board killed, but in the other incident, the plane was hit and
managed a crash landing with some survivors. The survivors were then
attacked and killed or wounded on the ground by the insurgents. A few
lucky passengers survived by hiding from the terrorists. All the dead
or wounded were civilians and included women and children.</LD>

<HD>More Talks Expected in Wall Street Analyst Probe</HD>
<DH>Meetings this week could bring firms and regulators closer
to a final settlement by Christmas, sources say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>After months of investigations and weeks of negotiations, Wall Street
firms and government regulators may know this week whether they'll
soon be able to reach a comprehensive settlement over stock-analyst
conflicts.</LD>
<LD>   The two sides will hold meetings Wednesday through Friday, sources
said. They hope to reach tentative agreements on the formal charges
that the government would bring and how much the brokerage firms
would pay to settle those charges, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Both are key issues, and consensus between regulators and a
majority of the firms could signal that a final deal is within reach.
But it is uncertain how many of the 12 firms under investigation
would agree to the details by Friday.</LD>
<TE>   "That would be a very big step forward," one regulator said late
last week. But "it doesn't mean it's going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   As they did over a three-day period in late November, regulators
will hold one-on-one meetings with individual companies, sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   At the first round of meetings, regulators told each company how
much it would have to pay in fines and what charges the government
was considering lodging against it.</TE>
<TE>   At the high end of the scale, Citigroup Inc., owner of Salomon
Smith Barney, could be fined $500 million, and Credit Suisse First
Boston could pay as much as $250 million. Some companies have since
made counteroffers, one regulator said.</TE>
<TE>   More than the fines, many firms are concerned about the charges
that could be leveled at them, government and corporate sources said.
The companies fear that allegations of serious wrongdoing could
worsen their potential liability in lawsuits and arbitrations brought
by individual investors.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of negotiating is happening over how the violations are
defined," one regulator said. "There's a lot of back and forth right
now."</TE>
<TE>   The probes by state and federal regulators center on whether stock
analysts intentionally skewed the advice they gave to investors
during the 1990s bull market. Investigators have uncovered e-mails
and other documents indicating that analysts at major firms touted
stocks they did not believe in so their firms could win lucrative
investment-banking work.</TE>
<TE>   The firms are expected to pay $1 billion or more in fines. They
are expected to shell out an additional $1 billion over five years to
distribute independent research to individual investors.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides hope to finalize a deal by Christmas. The firms want an
end to bad publicity, and the regulators want to finish their
resource-draining probes.</TE>
<TE>   They have been known as "global" settlement talks because
regulators are negotiating simultaneously with a dozen firms over a
single issue. In practical terms, however, regulators would have to
reach individual deals that would call for differing charges and
fines based on each firm's alleged culpability.</TE>
<TE>   If a deal cannot be reached with any firms, regulators could have
to wage potentially time-consuming court battles.</TE>
<TE>   Some firms think they can reach agreements in principle by the end
of the week.</TE>
<TE>   "If the language is acceptable, I imagine there would be
agreements in principle," said an official at one firm.</TE>
<TE>   However, an executive at another investment bank said significant
differences remain.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a fair amount of distance," the executive said. "That's a
lot to pull together" so close to the holidays.</TE>

<HD>Settlement Reveals Another Enron Strategy</HD>
<DH>The tactic, dubbed 'Thin Man,' comes out in a proposal
between El Paso Electric and federal regulators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Remember "Fat Boy" of Enron Corp. fame? Now, meet "Thin Man."</LD>
<LD>   Fat Boy was one of the many trading schemes that Enron used in
California to increase profits and perhaps illegally manipulate the
state's electricity market. To this drama, add a new character with
an equally colorful name: Thin Man, apparently borrowed from the
stylish mystery-comedies of the 1930s and '40s starring William
Powell and Myrna Loy.</LD>
<LD>   The Enron trading tactic came to light as a result of a proposed
settlement between El Paso Electric Co. and federal regulators,
unveiled late last week.</LD>
<TE>   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has been investigating El
Paso Electric since August because of evidence that an
electricity-marketing agreement between the utility and Enron was
improper and may have helped Enron boost electricity prices in
California. El Paso Electric did not admit guilt but, as part of the
settlement, agreed to refund $14 million in trading profit and to
give up electricity trading privileges for two years.</TE>
<TE>   Attached to the tentative settlement are 572 pages of exhibits and
testimony from FERC investigators that provide the latest window into
how Enron, once the world's largest energy trader, did business in
the West before and during California's energy crisis of 2000 and
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in 1997, Houston-based Enron had an accord with El Paso
Electric under which Enron would help sell into deregulated
electricity markets any spare electrons from power plants owned by
the El Paso-based utility, which serves more than 300,000 customers
in Texas, New Mexico and Mexico. (El Paso Electric is not related to
Houston-based El Paso Corp., which faces its own FERC investigation
into whether the company withheld natural gas supplies from
California during the energy crisis.)</TE>
<TE>   Through the contract with El Paso Electric and 11 similar
agreements with other power plant owners -- including municipal
utilities in Glendale, Redding and elsewhere in California -- Enron
controlled 3,500 megawatts of electricity per day as of August 2000,
according to the settlement exhibits. That amount of electricity,
enough to serve more than 2.6 million homes, is on a par with some of
the biggest suppliers to the electricity transmission grid operated
by the California Independent System Operator.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Contention Disputed</TE>
<TE>   Enron has contended that it primarily was a middleman in the
California market, with little control over electricity production
and prices. But the numbers laid out in the documents from the El
Paso Electric case belie that notion.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron always maintained they were just a bit player in
California," said Christian Schreiber, chief investigator with the
state Senate select committee probing manipulation of California's
electricity market. "The reason why El Paso Electric is interesting
is Enron was using municipal utilities in California ... to engineer
its schemes."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on
the El Paso Electric case, saying only that "we are cooperating fully
with all investigations."</TE>
<TE>   The relationships that Enron forged with the utilities were quite
lucrative for the company, accounting for nearly $9 million in profit
during the first seven months of 2000, investigators found.</TE>
<TE>   Those earnings are extraordinary considering that the time period
included only a few months of the gold-plated electricity prices that
began to plague California in May 2000 and remained at high levels
for about a year. FERC investigators said they were unable to
determine total earnings from the alliances because Enron, operating
under Bankruptcy Court protection, was unable to produce key
documents and because witnesses already were tied up by other
inquiries.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence shows that Enron entered into a substantial number
of 'alliances' with marketers and utilities and failed to disclose
the existence of any of these alliances to the commission," FERC
energy industry analyst Craig E. Detmers said in written testimony
submitted as part of the tentative settlement. "More significantly,
Enron appears to have utilized these alliances to manipulate prices
in the California markets in order to enrich itself."</TE>
<TE>   FERC also is looking into whether Enron was aided in its
questionable trading techniques by Avista Corp. of Spokane, Wash.,
and by Enron's utility subsidiary Portland General Electric. The
companies have denied wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   The FERC investigators unearthed evidence that El Paso Electric
allowed its power plants and transmission lines to be used in a
variety of schemes to increase electricity prices or wring payments
from California's complex system to relieve congestion on the
transmission grid serving about 75% of the state.</TE>
<TE>   The investigators singled out particular types of schemes, first
outlined in internal Enron memos released last May, including "Death
Star," "Ricochet" and Fat Boy.</TE>
<TE>   Death Star was a trading technique in which Enron would create
phony congestion on the transmission grid so it could then be paid to
relieve it.</TE>
<TE>   Ricochet involved selling electricity out of state -- thus
avoiding price caps on power generated in California -- and then
selling the power back into California at high emergency prices.</TE>
<TE>   In Fat Boy, Enron would tell electricity officials that it was
going to use more power than it actually intended to use. That way,
Enron would reap extra payments by appearing to deliver more power on
a high-demand day when, in fact, it was merely using less power than
promised.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the newly disclosed scheme, Thin Man, in which Enron
reversed the Fat Boy process to take advantage of days when overall
electricity demand on the grid was lower than anticipated. At those
times, the price paid in an advance market known as the PX might be
higher than the price in the Cal-ISO last-minute market.</TE>
<TE>   Thin Man didn't get a lot of use because Fat Boy and other
techniques designed to make the state grid operator think it was
running out of electricity were more profitable, said energy
economist Robert McCullough, a consultant for the state Senate
committee.</TE>
<TE>   "The premise was to make sure the PX was always short," McCullough
said. "You want to have a very nervous ISO so they give you a lot of
money" for last-minute electricity.</TE>

<HD>Timing of Farmer Bros. Meeting 'Bizarre'</HD>
<DH>Some dissidents suspect Dec. 26 shareholders meeting is a
move to defeat efforts to elect independent directors, increase
disclosure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Hirsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angry shareholders are wondering when the management of Farmer Bros.
Co. is going to wake up and smell the coffee.</LD>
<LD>   The Torrance-based roaster and seller of institutional coffee has
scheduled its annual stockholders meeting on the day after Christmas,
a move several dissidents see as a ploy to defeat efforts to force
the company to elect independent directors and to disclose more
information about its finances.</LD>
<LD>   Farmer Bros. is in the middle of a rancorous battle between one
branch of the founding family, headed by Chairman and Chief Executive
Roy F. Farmer and his hand-picked board, and a group of dissident
shareholders, led by mutual fund Franklin Mutual Advisors, which
controls 9.6%. Farmer's father founded the business in Los Angeles 90
years ago.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think there is another company in America that would
schedule a shareholders meeting on that day," said Steven Crowe,
nephew of the 86-year-old Farmer and a major stakeholder who is among
the dissidents.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to explain the timing of the meeting. I think it is
very disrespectful."</TE>
<TE>   The meeting is scheduled for 10 a.m. Dec. 26 at the company's
headquarters in an industrial section of Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer Bros. executives have provided no explanation for the
timing of the annual meeting, which was held in November last year,
and did not return calls seeking comment. They also have rejected
requests from some shareholders to reschedule the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Management is fighting a proposal by Franklin that would require
the company to comply with the Investment Company Act of 1940. Among
other things, the act gives independent directors broader authority
and mandates greater disclosure about a firm's investments and their
performance.</TE>
<TE>   In its only public comment on the situation -- in a letter faxed
late Friday to New York investment banker and corporate governance
activist Gary Lutin -- Farmer Bros. said "the proposal cannot pass."</TE>
<TE>   Farmer Bros. is sitting on $295 million in cash and investments,
an amount equivalent to about half of its total stock market value.
The stockpile of cash and securities represents about 70% of Farmer's
corporate assets. Generally, a firm with 40% or more of its assets in
investment securities and cash must adhere to the stricter disclosure
rules.</TE>
<TE>   Lack of disclosure about the company in general is at the heart of
the dissidents' dissatisfaction. Under Roy Farmer's management,
Farmer Bros., with $200 million in annual sales, has adhered to a
policy of disclosing as little as possible about its operations and
strategy. On Friday, Farmer Bros.' thinly traded shares closed at
$305 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Before scheduling the annual meeting, Farmer Bros. persuaded the
Securities and Exchange Commission to allow the company to keep off
its proxy statement a shareholder proposal by another major
stakeholder -- money manager Mitchell Partners of Costa Mesa -- that
dealt with the election of independent directors. But Farmer failed
to block the Franklin proposal. Both issues, however, are expected to
be debated at the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "The timing is bizarre," said Nell Minow, editor of Corporate
Library, a corporate watchdog Web site, and author of several books
on corporate governance.</TE>
<TE>   Though it is uncommon, it is not unprecedented for companies to
schedule meetings at inconvenient times or places to avoid dealing
with shareholders, Minow said.</TE>
<TE>   Maxxam Inc., a Houston-based owner of aluminum and lumber
companies, held its 1999 meeting in remote Huntsville, Texas, and
booked all of the nearby hotel rooms to prevent as many shareholders
as possible from making the early morning event, Minow said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, NetSol Technologies of Calabasas attempted to schedule
a special shareholders meeting in Lahore, Pakistan, but moved the
meeting to Southern California because of the volume of complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't take too much ingenuity to realize that anybody from
out of state would have to give up their Christmas to attend this
meeting. I don't think many people would do that," said Jim Mitchell,
who runs Mitchell Partners. The money management firm has owned 1,200
Farmer Bros. shares since 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell said he believed the timing of the meeting would decrease
the chances of any shareholder proposal's winning approval.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the irony is that Roy Farmer is likely to withstand the
dissidents' efforts regardless of when the meeting is held.
Management has voting control over 52% of the stock. That includes
the 12% of Farmer Bros. that Crowe and his sister own but can't vote
because the shares are part of a trust controlled by his uncle.</TE>
<TE>   "I plan to write a letter to my uncle asking him to vote those
shares for the Franklin proposal," Crowe said, quickly acknowledging
that his request is a long shot.</TE>
<TE>   Catherine Crowe, Steven's mother and the sister of Roy Farmer,
owns 10.6% of the company founded by her father and is expected to
vote the shares with Franklin and others creating a bloc of about 25%
of the company.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Farmer Bros. has used the proxy statement sent to
shareholders to recommend a "no" vote on the Franklin proposal. Yet
in another unconventional move, management did not offer any reasons
for its position.</TE>
<TE>   "It is surprising that they have not even provided an explanation
for why they recommended a 'no' vote on the Franklin proposal," Lutin
said. "If there is some reason to oppose it, they have a fiduciary
responsibility to explain it to shareholders."</TE>

<HD>Ford Won't Build Hybrid in Ohio</HD>
<DH>Automaker cites drop in demand in deciding against
assembling gas-saving Escape SUV at Avon Lake plant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>With sales decreasing, Ford Motor Co. has decided not to build a
hybrid version of the Escape sport utility vehicle at its Ohio
assembly plant, the automaker said.</LD>
<LD>   Ford had been considering building the hybrid Escape at the plant
in suburban Avon Lake alongside the regular Escape, which will go
into production there next summer.</LD>
<LD>   The hybrid Escape will use a small gasoline engine supplemented by
an electric motor. Ford officials say it will offer the power of an
SUV but use less gasoline. Sales of the regular Escape have dropped
14.4% this year through November, according to J.D. Power and
Associates.</LD>
<TE>   With a plant in Missouri that builds the Escape not working at
full capacity, it didn't make sense to build hybrids in Avon Lake,
said Roman Krygier Jr., Ford's group vice president for manufacturing
and quality.</TE>
<TE>   "Demand has dropped off. That was the reason," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Escape will be built in Avon Lake by about 800 workers laid
off earlier this year when Ford discontinued the Mercury Villager and
Nissan Quest minivans.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for $36 million in state tax incentives and grants,
Ford promised in August to keep those workers on the job for seven
years.</TE>

<HD>Gas Prices Drop 2 Cents Nationwide</HD>
<DH>Crude oil prices remain low amid ample supply. But analysts
say events could change that.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The price of a gallon of gas fell by 2 cents nationwide over the last
two weeks, an industry analyst said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The average weighted price for gas nationwide, including all
grades and taxes, was about $1.41 a gallon, according to the Lundberg
Survey of 8,000 stations.</LD>
<LD>   That's down 2 cents a gallon from Nov. 22, the date of the last
survey, when the average cost for a gallon of gas stood at $1.43,
said analyst Trilby Lundberg, who is based in Camarillo.</LD>
<TE>   The price dropped because crude oil prices remained low and
gasoline supplies remained ample, Lundberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "Total world oil production was more than sufficient to meet oil
demand, which reduced crude oil prices," Lundberg said. "Oil prices
had hit the $30-per-barrel mark some weeks ago. However, recently
they have been stable at under $27 per barrel."</TE>
<TE>   The national average is down about 7.5 cents a gallon since Nov.
8, when the weighted average price was about $1.49 a gallon. It's the
lowest price since March 22, when the price was $1.37 a gallon.</TE>
<TE>   Lundberg said there are many uncertainties about future prices of
oil and refined products, including possible war with Iraq, the
economy, gasoline supply and demand, and the renewed political crisis
in Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   Gas costs more than it did a year ago, when motorists were feeling
the effects of a post-Sept. 11 price slump. On Nov. 16, 2001, the
weighted average price for a gallon of gas was $1.23.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, the national weighted average price of gasoline,
including taxes, at self-serve pumps was about $1.38 a gallon for
regular, $1.48 for mid-grade and $1.57 for premium.</TE>

<HD>Employers Expect to Spend More on Health Care</HD>
<DH>Analysts say survey's findings may explain why some
companies are dropping coverage or switching plans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald D. White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles-area companies expect health-care spending on their
employees to jump nearly 15% next year, a survey set to be released
today has found.</LD>
<LD>   That would come on top of an expected 8.6% bump this year, when
employers will spend an average of $5,628 per worker, according to a
survey by Mercer Human Resource Consulting, an employee-benefits
consulting firm. Sixty-eighty California companies were part of the
survey, which polled 2,889 employers across the country.</LD>
<LD>   Nationally, employers expect health-care costs to rise 14.6% in
2003, about the same as this year's 14.7% increase, the steepest in a
dozen years and seven times the rate of inflation.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles-area companies are expecting the rate of increase to
double next year because they have been more aggressive in curtailing
costs through higher co-pays and deductibles and more restricted
formularies, according to Praveen Thadhani, a Mercer human resources
consultant. Many local employers don't feel they can take as hard a
line with their workers this coming year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, sharp cost increases are prompting some employers to
drop health-care coverage or switch to consumer- directed health
plans, the survey found. The percentage of small businesses -- those
that employ fewer than 50 workers -- that offered health-care
coverage fell to 62% nationally this year, from 66% in 2001, Thadhani
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say health-care costs could rise even faster than
companies are anticipating.</TE>
<TE>   "When you talk to insurance brokers who have their ears closest to
the ground, you hear of 20% to 40% increases for health-care costs in
each of the next three years," said Peter Boland, a health-care
expert in Berkeley. "Some are saying 60% for small to medium
companies."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco-based Wells Fargo &amp; Co. saw its health-care costs
surge 15.4%, or $60 million, to $450 million this year, said Sally
Welborn, the company's vice president of corporate benefits. Wells
Fargo has 130,000 employees and 25,000 insured retirees.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's calling it the perfect storm," Welborn said. "There's
one going on with health care for current employees and another on
the retirement side, and retiree costs are up even more dramatically.
It's quite a weather pattern. Certainly, the company cannot withstand
increases of this magnitude in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Actuaries working with employers on the survey said most of this
year's increase came from higher hospital charges, Thadhani said. A
report by the Center for Studying Health System Change found that
hospitals were responsible for more than half of the increase in
health-care costs because of additional medical tests and treatments
and higher hospital prices.</TE>
<TE>   Prescription-drug prices rose 16.9%, compared with 17.8% in 2001
and 18.3% in 2000, the survey found.</TE>
<TE>   The influence and popularity of the traditional HMO model, which
10 years ago brought health-care price inflation to a halt, continued
to wane. HMO enrollment nationally fell to 29% from 33% in 2001, as
enrollment in more expensive and less restrictive preferred provider
plans rose to 50% from 46%, the survey found.</TE>
<TE>   California remained the exception, with 62% of the employees at
the companies polled in the Los Angeles area enrolled in HMOs.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts begun last year to bring employees into the health-care
decision-making process are off to a slow start, Thadhani said.</TE>
<TE>   The idea was to give consumers effective and economical choices
about medical care, from hospital stays to prescription drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The theory was that consumers, once they were made more aware of
expenses, would make smarter and less-expensive choices. That's the
notion behind consumer-directed health plans, or CDHPs. But so far,
workers have been cool to the concept.</TE>
<TE>   Under a CDHP, a company contributes a set amount per employee --
from $500 to $1,000 a year -- into a health/medical care account.
Workers can use those funds to purchase health care, but they are
responsible for any costs above their account limit until they reach
an annual deductible, usually $500 or $1,000 above the value of the
health-care account. Once they exhaust that amount, employees move to
a traditional health-care plan and are fully covered.</TE>
<TE>   Wells Fargo is offering its employees a CDHP this year, from
Minnesota-based Definity Health, Welborn said. Workers get a $1,000
personal care account and have an annual deductible of $1,500,
leaving a $500 gap. Once the employee has reached the $1,500
deductible, the health-care coverage takes effect, and out-of-pocket
expenses stop at $2,000.</TE>
<TE>   So far, however, fewer than 2,000 Wells Fargo employees have
signed up with the CDHP.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford University, which has 10,000 employees and saw its
health-care costs rise more than 20% this year, considered offering
such a plan but decided against it. That's because Stanford did not
find that the CDHP was "mature enough" in terms of available doctors
and offerings, said John Cammidge, the university's director of human
resources.</TE>
<TE>   "Health care for the uninsured and insured is a premier challenge
for the country at the moment," Cammidge added. "It can't continue in
the way that it has over the last two years. It's not possible."</TE>
<TE>   Every time there has been a big hike in health-care costs, "there
has always been a counteraction or an intervention or the threat of
one," Boland said. "Now, managed care is dead as a cost-containment
vehicle."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Tenet Healthcare Corp., the Santa Barbara-based
hospital operator that has been the subject of lawsuits and federal
inquiries regarding its business and pricing policies, say it's too
easy to make hospitals the major culprits of rising costs.</TE>
<TE>   "Managed care was doing what it was supposed to do. Consumers and
providers revolted," Tenet spokesman Harry Anderson said. "It's not
just that hospital costs are rising. They are rising in the aggregate
because there is more hospital care being provided."</TE>
<TE>   Stanford Professor Alain Enthoven, widely considered the father of
the managed-care system, said blame for the current situation is
shared by many, including employers and consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Enthoven said consumers are guilty of "a pervasive environment of
cost-unconscious demand" for more sophisticated and expensive medical
care without having any willingness to help foot the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, managed-care companies have abandoned their gatekeeper
role and no longer are taking steps to rein in unnecessary care,
Enthoven said. Doctors and hospitals, he pointed out, are sometimes
rewarded for ineffective treatment and medical errors when they are
paid again for the further treatment necessary to correct mistakes
and help the patient recover.</TE>
<TE>   Employers share in the blame by arguing that consumer-driven
health plans are mere shells for weak programs that emphasize higher
deductibles, Enthoven said, adding that employees should push for a
wide range of options rather than settling for one or two choices.</TE>
<TE>   Yet a broad range of choices only matters when they are very
different and do not have overlapping programs and doctors, noted
Peter Lee, president of the Pacific Business Group on Health, a group
of 48 companies that buys health-care coverage for about 3 million
workers.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer-driven health plans are important because they "engage
consumers as the drivers of care," he said. "It promotes health-care
consumerism, and we are starting to see health plans step up to the
plate as the information sources to help enrollees make better
choices."</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pasadena's Doubletree Hotel will become the Westin Pasadena next week
as part of a $9-million upgrade of the 12-story tower near Old
Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   The hotel was built in 1989 by Los Angeles-based MaguirePartners
as part of Plaza Las Fuentes.</LD>
<LD>   The 3.5-acre complex includes an eight-story office building,
courtyard gardens and two free-standing restaurants. A second,
five-story office tower at the northwest corner of Colorado Boulevard
and Los Robles Avenue is under construction.</LD>
<TE>   Westin is a division of New York-based Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts
Worldwide. Doubletree is a division of Hilton Hotels Corp., which is
based in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "Pasadena has been at the top of our development list for a long
time," said Geoff Ballotti, executive vice president of North
American hotel operations for Starwood. The company also operates the
Sheraton Pasadena Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The $9-million makeover by MaguirePartners will take place over
three years, beginning with upgrades to the beds and bathrooms. It
eventually will include other refurbishments of the 350 guest rooms,
lobby and other public areas. MaguirePartners also owns the Sheraton
Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   The contract to manage the hotel at Plaza Las Fuentes will pass
from Hilton to Starwood on Dec. 20.</TE>

<HD>Japan Raises GDP Estimate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Japan today raised its estimate of third-quarter economic growth as
consumers in the world's second-largest economy spent more than
initially reported.</LD>
<LD>   Gross domestic product rose 0.8% last quarter, seasonally
adjusted, from the second quarter. That compares with an initial
estimate of 0.7% growth. Growth in the second quarter was revised to
a gain of 0.9% from an initial estimate of 1% growth, the
government's Cabinet Office said.</LD>
<LD>   Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than half of
the economy, was revised to a gain of 1% from a 0.8% increase.</LD>
<TE>   Japan already may be heading toward its fourth recession in a
decade as companies cut jobs and wages in response to sagging
exports. That's likely to shake consumer confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not possible to hope for a sustained recovery in consumer
spending anytime soon," said Minako Iida, an economist at Deutsche
Securities Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   "It's likely that the economy will return to recession, possibly
in this or the next quarter," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's economy grew at an annual pace of 3.2% in the
July-September quarter, faster than the initial estimate of 3%
growth, the GDP report showed.</TE>
<TE>   Exports grew 0.6% in the third quarter, more than the earlier
estimate of a 0.5% gain and less than the second quarter's 5.9%
expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Companies such as Sanyo Electric Co., the world's biggest maker of
mobile-phone batteries, are cutting jobs and wages, pushing the
unemployment rate up to 5.55% in October, matching last December's
record.</TE>

<HD>Losing Week Fuels Doubts on Recovery</HD>
<DH>Conflicting economic numbers, war fears and shaky tech and
telecom prospects are keeping investors wary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some investors are wondering if Christmas already has come and gone
on Wall Street.</LD>
<LD>   Last week brought an end to the Dow Jones industrial average's
eight-week winning streak and marked only the second losing week for
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index since early October.</LD>
<LD>   A pullback after a strong rally can be expected, analysts said.
But this drop, accompanied by recent mixed readings on the U.S.
economy, raises doubts about whether the 2 1/2-year-old bear market
is ready for a robust reversal.</LD>
<TE>   "The stock market has gotten a little ahead of itself," said Alan
Adelman, chief investment strategist at Wells Fargo &amp; Co.'s private
client services in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors are going to demand more evidence that an economic
recovery is underway before sending stocks higher."</TE>
<TE>   The Dow, which rallied 1,645 points from its six-year closing low
Oct. 9 through its recent high Nov. 27, has backed away sharply from
that peak. At its intra-day low Friday -- before Treasury Secretary
Paul H. O'Neill and White House economic advisor Lawrence B. Lindsey
tendered their resignations -- the index had given up one-fourth of
its October-November rally.</TE>
<TE>   The comeback had been fueled by economic reports pointing to
stability and modest, if unspectacular, growth. But in the last week,
the various data have sent conflicting signals. Strong productivity
numbers early in the week, for example, were followed Friday by the
Labor Department's report on November unemployment, which surged to a
higher-than-expected 6%.</TE>
<TE>   Though Adelman remains guardedly optimistic that the market
reached a meaningful low in early October, he said the spike in
joblessness raises the risk that nervous consumers might curtail
their spending -- an unsettling prospect for the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, corporate profits appear to be gradually improving, said
Chuck Hill, research director at earnings tracker Thomson First Call
in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   However, it's still early in the fourth-quarter "confession
season," when companies come clean with analysts and investors by
revising their earlier earnings guidance for the period. More clues
about the near-term trend could emerge this week as more companies
release profit outlooks. Thomson First Call expects S&amp;P 500 earnings
to grow 15% in the quarter compared with last year.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the companies that have issued warnings so far -- such as
Walt Disney Co., which appears to have a mega-flop on its hands with
the animated film "Treasure Planet" -- face specific problems that
have little broad economic effect, Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   The problem for the stock market, he added, is that business
fundamentals remain shaky in technology and telecommunications.</TE>
<TE>   Those sectors paced the October-November rally, but the surge made
tech and telecom stocks a lot more expensive just as their business
prospects became murkier.</TE>
<TE>   Some in the sector, such as chip makers Intel Corp. and Advanced
Micro Devices Inc., say their fourth-quarter sales will be strong.
But looking further out, other tech companies, such as
Hewlett-Packard Co., have given downward guidance on revenue
estimates for 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "The tech companies may be on track to hit their bottom-line
numbers, but they're doing it through cost-cutting rather than sales
growth. That's not encouraging," Hill said, because sales growth is
seen as essential to a healthy earnings trend.</TE>
<TE>   Hopes for a pickup in business capital spending have been pushed
back to the third quarter of 2003 at the earliest, sending tech
profit forecasts into a free fall.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates for overall S&amp;P 500 earnings growth in the first
quarter, for instance, have been ratcheted down to 12.3% from earlier
estimates of 25.3%. But profit growth estimates for the tech stocks
in the S&amp;P 500 have contracted more dramatically, to 15% from 60%.</TE>
<TE>   Tech's troubles raise two issues for the market, Hill said. First,
they may signal that the economic recovery is "further away than
anybody realizes."</TE>
<TE>   Second, investors rushing back into the sector could be setting
themselves up for a nasty tailspin, just as they did in the late
1990s and early 2000. In a downturn, volatile and steeply valued
stocks often are hardest hit. Indeed, the tech-laden Nasdaq composite
index has fallen 4.4% during the recent sell-off, compared with a
loss of 2.8% for the S&amp;P 500.</TE>
<TE>   With U.N. weapons inspectors on the ground in Baghdad, fears of a
U.S.-Iraq war also weigh heavily on investors and on the economy,
analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "The market has been suffering from Iraq-aphobia, but I think the
likelihood is that a conflict would not be as bad as many people
fear," said Richard DeKaser, chief economist at National City Corp.
in Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, DeKaser said he didn't see oil surging above $40 a
barrel, as some have warned, given the recent buildup in U.S. and
European reserves and the likelihood that members of the Organization
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would ensure supply.</TE>
<TE>   By late winter or early spring, he said, the conflict could be
settled, which would probably put U.S. businesses in more of a
spending mood.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's White House shake-up also could have a positive effect on
the market, analysts said, because O'Neill was seen as a potential
impediment to tax cuts and other fiscal stimulus measures.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a lot of monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve
cutting interest rates," Adelman said, noting that the Fed has
slashed its benchmark interest rate to a four-decade low of 1.25%.</TE>
<TE>   "What was missing was fiscal stimulus, and now we're going to get
some."</TE>
<TE>   One proposal that could give investors and the economy a boost, he
said, is the elimination of "double taxation" on dividends, which are
taxed as income when corporations record profit, then taxed again if
distributed to shareholders in dividend form.</TE>
<TE>   Such a move could send dividend yields, already on the rise, still
higher, making stocks more attractive to investors.</TE>
<TE>   A separate proposal to increase the amount of realized capital
losses that can be written off against income -- currently $3,000 --
could boost consumer spending as well, Adelman said.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed, which cut its benchmark interest rate by half of a point
at its Nov. 6 meeting, isn't likely to notch the rate any lower when
it gathers Tuesday, analysts say.</TE>

<HD>Bush Weighs Critical Decision on Oil Reserves</HD>
<DH>The president faces same question that jinxed his father's
administration: when to tap U.S. stockpile.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Warren Vieth</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Two thousand feet below the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast, the U.S.
government is building a stockpile of crude oil already large enough
to make up about three years' worth of lost imports from Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Now, as President Bush prepares for a possible military offensive
to oust Saddam Hussein, he faces a critical decision that jinxed his
father's administration: Should he keep the emergency oil in the
ground until supplies run short? Or should he open the tap
immediately to keep prices from soaring and the economy from sinking?</LD>
<LD>   "It's hugely, hugely important," said Adam Sieminski, global oil
strategist for Deutsche Bank in London. "It could be the difference
between $80 oil and $30 oil."</LD>
<TE>   Bush's father waited until six months after Iraq invaded Kuwait in
August 1990 to declare his intention to utilize the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve. By that time, oil prices had doubled and the
economy was headed for recession.</TE>
<TE>   Although the current Bush administration has stepped up deliveries
of crude oil into the reserve's underground salt caverns, industry
analysts say oil markets might panic if war began without an
immediate and unequivocal pledge to draw down the reserves.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unresolved Debate</TE>
<TE>   Their concern reflects an unresolved policy debate dating back to
the energy crises of the 1970s. One camp says the government should
wait for clear evidence of a supply shortfall before turning to the
strategic reserve. The other argues that Washington should act
preemptively so that oil traders won't send prices through the roof
and consumer confidence into the cellar.</TE>
<TE>   Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham has indicated the administration
would prefer to hold off in the absence of a "major supply
disruption."</TE>
<TE>   The head of the International Energy Agency, the Paris-based
organization established in 1974 to coordinate the energy policies of
the United States and other industrialized nations, has endorsed a
similar approach.</TE>
<TE>   If the outbreak of war cuts off Iraq's oil exports, which have
been averaging about 1 1/2-million barrels a day, IEA Executive
Director Robert J. Priddle said he would like to give other OPEC oil
producers an opportunity to honor recent promises to make up the
difference.</TE>
<TE>   "We would prefer not to intervene in the market. If the suppliers
can meet the needs of their customers, we'd like to leave them to do
that," Priddle said. "If for any reason that didn't happen, or if the
market wasn't sufficiently reassured by what they heard, we have the
capacity to make ... much more than 1 1/2 million barrels per day,
and we can do it fast."</TE>
<TE>   The capacity to act is clearly there. The International Energy
Agency's 26 member nations, including the U.S., hold 1.3-billion
barrels of oil in strategic reserves, in addition to 2.6 billion
barrels of crude oil and refined products held by private oil
companies. That's equivalent to 114 days of oil imports, Priddle
said.</TE>
<TE>   The 26 countries could draw as much as 10-million barrels of crude
oil a day from strategic reserves for a month or so, with maximum
output gradually declining as more and more tanks were drained.</TE>
<TE>   The organization says the current stockpile would have been
sufficient to cover the worst supply shortfall in history: the
six-month, 5.6-million-barrel decline in daily production during the
Iranian revolution of 1978-79.</TE>
<TE>   Equally important, Priddle said, is the improving relationship
between IEA countries and OPEC oil producers, particularly Saudi
Arabia. When the IEA was formed in response to the Arab oil embargo,
the atmosphere was highly confrontational. Now, Priddle can pick up
the phone and talk supply with the Saudi oil minister.</TE>
<TE>   The 10 members of OPEC besides Iraq have enough spare capacity to
boost production by as much as 4.9-million barrels a day, far more
than Iraq currently exports, and Priddle said officials in Saudi
Arabia and other OPEC members have promised to make up any lost
output.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, meanwhile, can take unilateral advantage of its
own strategic reserve. After the Sept. 11 attacks, Bush announced
plans to increase reserves from about 550-million barrels to its
maximum capacity of 700-million barrels by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   The reserve now holds a record 595-million barrels. That's enough
oil to cover about 1,200 days of lost imports from Iraq, or 66 days
of total U.S. imports. The reserve could be drawn down at a maximum
rate of 4.1 million barrels a day for three months; so far this year,
U.S. imports of Iraqi oil have averaged 483,000 barrels a day.</TE>
<TE>   One senior administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, declined to speculate on possible war scenarios but said
that as for tapping the reserve in an emergency, "we've ruled nothing
out."</TE>
<TE>   The official said, however, that the Bush administration is
opposed to using strategic oil reserves to manipulate market prices
in the absence of a significant shortage, as the Clinton
administration did two years ago in response to complaints about
rising fuel oil prices.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Decisive Action</TE>
<TE>   In the view of some experts, it's not just the number of barrels
in the ground that will matter if the United States launches a
military offensive in Iraq. It's also the willingness to act
immediately and decisively to avert a supply shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Sieminski said the president should announce a drawdown at the
same time he tells Americans that U.S. troops are on their way to
Baghdad. "The futures markets are not going to wait for reassurances
from the kingdom of Saudi Arabia or OPEC or President Bush or Robert
Priddle," Sieminski said.</TE>
<TE>   "They debated this for six months in 1990," he added. "We know
that waiting six months was a bad idea. So is waiting six days any
better? Or should you give it about six hours?"</TE>
<TE>   America's strategic stockpile may be fuller than ever, but the
nation's import habit has increased too, and global inventories are
at historically low levels, Newport Beach energy economist Philip K.
Verleger Jr. said. It wouldn't take much, he said, to spook oil
traders into bidding up the price first and asking questions later.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a psychological effect," Verleger said. "Because stocks
today are so very low, if there's a problem and governments don't
respond immediately, it could be catastrophic. Once the price starts
to escalate, trade freezes, and then it takes a much bigger response
to stop something."</TE>
<TE>   Many economists say the doubling of oil prices to about $40 a
barrel after Iraq's Aug. 2, 1990, invasion of Kuwait helped push the
U.S. economy into recession -- a downturn that may have cost the
elder Bush his job. When the U.S. and other IEA nations finally
announced plans to tap strategic reserves on Jan. 17, 1991, the price
dropped $10 a barrel overnight.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the delay was reluctance by some presidential
advisors to intervene in the marketplace, even though the crisis had
reduced world oil production by 4.3 million barrels a day.</TE>
<TE>   Robert E. Ebel, energy program director at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, said he thinks the United States
and other IEA nations learned from that experience and are unlikely
to repeat it. "We always want to act in concert with our friends and
allies," he said. "They were a little reluctant 10 years ago to take
that step. I think they're ready now."</TE>
<TE>   Still, there's a fine line between prudent reserve policy and
counterproductive price manipulation, which can reduce the incentive
for oil companies to hold their own inventories.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking backward with 20-20 hindsight, it's easy to say that Bush
did too little too late in 1990," said Ed Porter, research manager at
the American Petroleum Institute in Washington. "But it's very hard
in the midst of a developing crisis to try to do something
preemptively."</TE>

<HD>Dockworker Caucus to Debate Contract</HD>
<DH>Outcome of delegates' review of the proposed West Coast
labor pact will help sway union members' vote in Jan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Delegates representing West Coast dockworkers are gathering this week
in San Francisco to debate a contract proposal hammered out last
month between union leaders and major shippers and terminal
operators.</LD>
<LD>   The delegates' caucus is crucial because its outcome will help
sway how the 10,500 members of the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union will vote in January. At least 60% of the ILWU
membership must ratify the pact for it to pass.</LD>
<LD>   A recommendation from the caucus requires a majority vote among
the 80 delegates.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a democratic process," said Steve Stallone, an ILWU
spokesman. "I expect they will find every blemish there is to be
found in the contract, but they will have to discuss and debate the
value of the contract as a whole."</TE>
<TE>   The contract proposal calls for wages to rise by $3 an hour over
six years, substantial increases in worker pensions, and fully paid
family health insurance. In exchange, the Pacific Maritime Assn.,
which represents about 80 shipping lines and terminal operators, has
the right to begin using advanced technology -- such as computer
systems, optical scanners and remote cameras -- to speed cargo flow
and eliminate hundreds of high-wage clerical jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The unusual six-year labor pact was reached after months of
acrimony and costly showdowns that rippled through the national
economy. The contract would cover all U.S. commercial ports on the
West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   The length of the pact has left some uneasy. All previous
contracts have been for three years.</TE>
<TE>   "From what I'm hearing from other ports, when members have a
chance to read what the tentative agreement is, they're expressing
extreme dismay over parts of it," Jack Heyman, a caucus delegate who
opposes the contract because of its duration, told Associated Press.
"To have a contract of six years is like heading a ship through
narrow straits without navigational charts."</TE>
<TE>   Starting today, the delegates will review the contract as
negotiated by the union's executive committee. Then they will spend
the rest of the week pelting union leaders with questions. On Friday,
delegates will recommend that the union's rank-and-file membership
either reject or approve the contract. Members are expected to cast
their ballots next month.</TE>

<HD>Retail Sales, Producer Price Reports Due</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Among the economic numbers to watch this week will be November retail
sales, followed by the U.S. producer price index for November.</LD>
<LD>   Total retail sales are expected to have risen 0.3% to 0.4% in
November after flat sales in October.</LD>
<LD>   The report, due from the Commerce Department on Thursday, is
expected to show improving sales at car dealerships. Excluding autos,
sales probably rose 0.2%, the fifth increase in the last six months,
after a 0.7% gain in October.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike other years, when November sales got a boost from spending
on Christmas gifts, last month's sales will reflect just two days of
consumers' post-Thanksgiving holiday shopping.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's PPI, a gauge of inflation at the wholesale price level,
is expected to be unchanged in November for both the overall index
and the core PPI, excluding volatile food and energy prices.</TE>
<TE>   "Producer inflation remains virtually nonexistent outside of the
energy complex," said Steve Wood, chief economist at FinancialOxygen
Inc., a Walnut Creek, Calif.-based provider of financial services to
banks.</TE>
<TE>   Prices of foreign-made goods also are expected to be tame. The
import price index, due from the Labor Department on Thursday,
probably fell 0.3% in November, the first drop in five months, after
rising 0.1% the previous month.</TE>
<TE>   A more stable stock market and a favorable buying environment are
expected to buoy consumer confidence. The University of Michigan's
preliminary index of December consumer sentiment, due Friday, is
expected to rise to 85, the second consecutive increase, from 84.2.</TE>
<TE>   Other reports this week:</TE>
<TE>   * Today, the Commerce Department will report on wholesale
inventories for October.</TE>
<TE>   * Thursday, the Commerce Department is expected to report the
nation's current account deficit, the broadest measure of
international trade because it includes investments.</TE>
<TE>   * Friday, the Commerce Department will report on October
inventories at all businesses, including factories, wholesalers and
retailers.</TE>

<HD>Fed Expected to Leave Rates Unchanged</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After last month's dramatic half-percentage-point cut in short-term
interest rates, the Federal Reserve Board has little choice but to
stay on the sidelines at Tuesday's policy meeting, according to
analysts.</LD>
<LD>   But even though the Fed is widely expected to leave rates
unchanged, Friday's dismal jobs report and turmoil in the Bush
administration's economic team may give the central bank more to
worry about in the future.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. unemployment shot up to 6% in November, the Labor Department
said, and nonfarm payrolls sank by 40,000.</LD>
<TE>   Soon after that report was released Friday, Treasury Secretary
Paul H. O'Neill and National Economic Council Chairman Lawrence B.
Lindsey abruptly resigned, prompting a fever of speculation about
their replacements and the future of White House economic policy.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Friday's drama, economists say the overall U.S. economic
picture is little changed from when the Fed acted in early November.</TE>
<TE>   Job growth is stalled, but the economy still is eking out growth,
albeit at a sluggish pace. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
testifying before a Capitol Hill committee, called the current
economic environment "a soft patch."</TE>
<TE>   In a poll Friday, economists said they expected the Fed to leave
rates unchanged not just Tuesday but also at its next policy meeting
Jan. 28 and 29.</TE>
<TE>   Many believe there may be no change in rates for months to come.</TE>
<TE>   At its Nov. 6 meeting, the central bank took financial markets by
surprise with a larger-than-expected half-percentage-point rate cut.
However, the Fed tried to temper expectations that rates would be cut
further.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Dederick, economic consultant with Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago, said the Fed was biding its time to see how the economy
would react to its latest round of rate cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Dederick said the Fed will want to see how the crucial holiday
shopping season plays out. With war against Iraq a possibility and
the job market still in the doldrums, many experts are concerned that
holiday sales will be slow.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed also will be watching to see if businesses begin investing
again in new plants and equipment.</TE>

<HD>Accused Execs Are Finding Plea Agreements Palatable</HD>
<DH>Deals are getting harder to turn down as sentencing for
corporate misbehavior toughens.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. Scott Reckard</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If federal prosecutors have their way, drug lords, Mafia dons and
mass murderers could be welcoming some new members to the
30-years-to-life club: top executives accused of cooking the books at
companies such as Homestore Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The plea agreements that two executives of Westlake Village-based
Homestore struck recently with federal authorities spell out the
stark alternative they would have faced at trial: a slew of fraud and
conspiracy charges that, according to a tally by prosecutors, could
have resulted in a mandatory life prison sentence.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Joseph J. Shew pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy,
and John M. Giesecke Jr. pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy
and one count of fraud, capping their potential sentences at five and
10 years, respectively. They are cooperating with investigations of
Homestore higher-ups and business partners who, they contend,
conceived and approved illegal accounting schemes in 2000 and 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Even though the plea agreements still hold out the prospect of
serious jail time, defense attorneys say these kinds of deals are
becoming harder to turn down as federal officials, using tough new
sentencing rules, threaten targets in corporate scandals with prison
terms of 25 years, 30 years or more.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like bombers coming in," said a lawyer for another former
executive who could be charged in the phony-revenue case at
Homestore, which puts home-sales listings and related information on
the Internet. "You just look at these numbers and it really does the
government's work for them, even if your guy has a strong defense."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Change in Attitude</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the trend toward taking a tougher stance on
corporate fraud cases began in the late 1990s, encouraged by former
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt. It
intensified as the stock markets declined beginning in 2000. And it
kicked into high gear as the wave of corporate accounting scandals
broke over the last year, according to Gregory J. Weingart, chief of
the major frauds unit at the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Weingart said his unit has handled about a dozen
corporate-corruption investigations this year, compared with just one
or two annually in the mid-1990s. And a Justice Department
corporate-fraud task force formed last July includes seven U.S.
attorneys from offices around the country, including Debra Yang in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that U.S. attorney's offices around the
country that once were reluctant to take our cases are no longer"
reluctant, said Randall Lee, who became head of the SEC's Pacific
regional office in Los Angeles in 2001 after seven years in the
criminal division of the U.S. attorney's office in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   It's an attitude that comes from the top. In recent months, U.S.
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft has pushed for "real-time enforcement" of
fraud laws, with U.S. attorney's offices, the SEC and other agencies
combining "to end criminal activity before jobs, investments and
assets are squandered," as he put it in a Sept. 27 speech.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent securities-law conference in Los Angeles, Giesecke's
defense attorney, Jan Handzlik, said the potential sentences for
fraud "can be quite staggering" for executives, including for "some
of my clients, who didn't realize they were going to be subjected to
this."</TE>
<TE>   At the same conference, Weingart told the audience of securities
lawyers, regulators and prosecutors: "A top executive could get 30
years to life under the new rules."</TE>
<TE>   The alternative, he said, is to plead guilty to charges carrying a
lower maximum sentence and cooperate with authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Critics complain that the extreme potential penalties will force
defendants into making guilty pleas when they're innocent.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to get people buying themselves out of these long
jail terms by perjury," said veteran Washington defense lawyer Robert
Bennett, whose clients have included former President Clinton and
Enron Corp. "It's their only way out."</TE>
<TE>   Federal sentencing guidelines in fraud cases have been toughened
over the years and were given a dramatic boost last year, especially
in cases in which financial losses are large.</TE>
<TE>   On the sentencing scorecard, for instance, a basic fraud with a
loss of a few thousand dollars would indicate a sentence with no jail
time for first-time offenders such as Shew and Giesecke.</TE>
<TE>   But after adjustments for factors such as abusing public trust,
victimizing more than 50 people and, especially, for costing
Homestore shareholders more than $100 million, the sentence mandated
by the guidelines is life in prison -- although it drops to the
25-to-30-year range for acceptance of responsibility and could be
lowered by other considerations.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys say prosecutors in major corporate corruption
cases are proposing plea agreements containing 15-to-20-year
sentences in negotiations with top executives who the defense
contends never had any intent to commit crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "What worries me is that there will be some white-collar guys who
won't plead to an agreement like that, go to trial and get a 30-year
sentence they don't deserve," Bennett said. "These draconian
sentences heretofore have been reserved for the worst of the worst --
drug kingpins and multiple murderers."</TE>
<TE>   The potential penalties were far lighter during the last wave of
high-profile insider-trading and bank-fraud prosecutions in the 1980s
and early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Ivan F. Boesky, the central player in Wall Street's
insider-trading scandals of the '80s, settled his case by paying $100
million in penalties, pleading guilty to one felony and serving two
years at the federal prison camp in Lompoc, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   That sort of deal was the norm in white-collar frauds before the
sentencing guidelines took effect in 1987, noted Sandra Jordan, a
University of Pittsburgh criminal-law professor and former
white-collar prosecutor. Even for defendants convicted of 20 fraud
counts with a maximum 100-year sentence, "you rarely saw anyone get
anything like five years," Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>   That slowly began to change by the early '90s, when Charles H.
Keating Jr. was convicted in state and federal court of looting
Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, costing taxpayers $2.9 billion
and Lincoln's mainly elderly depositors $285 million. Keating, whose
convictions were overturned, served less than five years of his
federal prison sentence of 12 years and 7 months.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought the deck was stacked against defendants then, but it's
nothing compared to what we have now," said Keating's attorney,
Stephen C. Neal.</TE>
<TE>   And given the anger over executives who grew rich while
shareholders and employees were devastated at companies such as
Enron, "no one is going to temper it any time soon," Neal added.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Judges' Discretion</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts say judges, though limited by the guidelines when
defendants lose at trial, may find ways to reduce overly harsh
sentences by citing health and family concerns, aberrant behavior and
effects on innocent employees. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals,
which reviews California decisions, has been especially willing to
accept such "downward departures."</TE>
<TE>   What's more, judges have wide leeway when prosecutors recommend
sentence reductions based on the cooperation of defendants who accept
plea agreements, Weingart pointed out.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys say they often try to tailor those agreements so
their clients admit to tax or other charges stemming from the fraud,
but with far lighter sentences.</TE>
<TE>   That was the case for John DeSimone, a relatively minor former
Homestore financial executive, who pleaded guilty to making $170,000
selling Homestore stock though he knew the company's financial
statements were inflated. If he cooperates to the satisfaction of
prosecutors, DiSimone could be sentenced to home confinement or
probation.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, legal experts will be watching closely for unusual
deals such as the one worked out with Michael Milken, the
controversial junk bond king.</TE>
<TE>   Milken pleaded guilty to securities violations in 1990 and was
sentenced to 10 years in prison. But because of provisions in his
cooperation agreement with prosecutors, he spent less than two years
in custody in a minimum-security prison and a halfway house in
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   It's unlikely that today's violators will see their sentences
reduced to that extent, because so many loopholes have been closed,
said Handzlik, Giesecke's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "The options that were provided by the sentencing laws then are no
longer on the table," Handzlik said. "There won't be any escape
clauses."</TE>

<LD>Allison Ash's first day as a reporter for KGPE-TV Channel 47 was
spent chasing dead cows.</LD>
<LD>   Ash and a cameraman had driven an hour south of here to report on
Central California's latest outbreak of infectious bovine
tuberculosis. They found the farm, but not the herd because the
animals had been slaughtered a week earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Still, the news must go on -- especially when it's sweeps season
and stations are clamoring for viewers to drive up ad rates. So,
dressed in a black suit and heels, Ash talked her way onto the muddy
farm lot last month and taped a "stand-up" report for the 5 o'clock
news.</LD>
<TE>   "Every market has its own personality," Ash said later as she
gamely prepared for another day in the trenches at a station where
sweeps month assumes a kind of importance unmatched in the big
metropolitan markets.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and other larger cities, ratings
and demographic information gleaned during the year's three sweeps
periods remain crucial in determining ad rates and bragging rights.
But stations in those top 55 TV markets have the benefit -- some call
it a burden -- of getting generalized viewership statistics every day
from Nielsen Media Research Inc., giving executives a good idea of
how they're doing.</TE>
<TE>   Not so in Fresno, which is ranked 57, and other markets where
stations can't afford the Nielsen overnights. For them, the sweeps
period rules the day, providing the only breakdown of viewership
information and thus determining how much local advertisers will pay.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually all that money is spent during local newscasts because
the big networks -- Viacom Inc.-owned CBS, General Electric Co.-owned
NBC and Walt Disney Co.-owned ABC, for example -- keep the lion's
share of prime-time commercial dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "Sweeps are like getting dressed up for church, inviting your
neighbors over for dinner," said General Manager Barry Barth of
Channel 47, a CBS affiliate. "You want to be at your best because
that's when you are being measured.... Unfortunately, the American
way is to compete."</TE>
<TE>   Just before Christmas, the results for the November sweeps will be
known and Barth may be able to loosen his collar -- or be forced to
hunker down for more combat. Among other things, he will learn
whether anyone is watching the three syndicated programs -- "Will &amp;
Grace," "Just Shoot Me" and "That '70s Show" -- the low-rated station
just bought as lead-ins to its all-important evening news hours.
Despite the technological revolution, the fortunes of Barth's station
are still tied to a practice that debuted in 1958, when CBS'
"Gunsmoke" was television's top-rated show. Ever since, families
throughout the country, selected by Nielsen, have been jotting down
the shows they watch in paper diaries. In Fresno, there are about 500
of those homes.</TE>
<TE>   CBS President and Chief Executive Leslie Moonves says the
monthlong sweeps, when the networks try to help the local stations by
giving them gussied-up programming, only steals quality shows that
could be spread throughout the year.</TE>
<TE>   "The sweeps system is an old and artificial way of doing
business," he said. "No network is happy having to schedule for
sweeps because in certain instances, it screws up the rest of the
year."</TE>
<TE>   For now, however, there's no alternative for the hundreds of
stations in smaller markets, where it can cost more than $1 million
annually to install the technology and pay the overhead for overnight
results.</TE>
<TE>   At Channel 47, and others like it, there's barely enough money to
cover the news.</TE>
<TE>   "Our anchors aren't sitting around drinking coffee eight hours a
day," News Director Thomas Burke said. Everyone, he said, is expected
to pitch in.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, for example, anchor Susie Frankeberger cleans the set,
which was painted one recent fall weekend by Burke and some of his
staff.</TE>
<TE>   Frankeberger returned two years ago to California's Central Valley
because the single mom wanted to be closer to her mother, a local
hairdresser.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole idea of sweeps is pretty bizarre," Frankeberger said.
"Like right now, it's fog season, and the most important thing we can
do this week is to tell people which schools are on a fog schedule."</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, she added, "we try to push every day to be
consistent."</TE>
<TE>   Consistency is difficult, however. In fact, the operation spends
so much of its time putting out fires, popular on-air personality Sam
Dog the Dalmatian seems a fitting mascot.</TE>
<TE>   Its creaky old transmitter is prone to breakdowns. The station
recently switched to an automated camera system that has provided
viewers with some unexpected candid moments: During a newscast, one
of the cameras on the set suddenly started rotating and showed the
weatherman standing casually in front of a big green screen without
the superimposed maps and graphics.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the recent Thursday during sweeps when Channel 47
began its 5 p.m. newscast with a poignant six-minute story about a
mother coping with the murders of her four children by her
ex-husband, who then killed himself.</TE>
<TE>   As the story unfolded on the screen, Burke noticed that a
competing station was leading its broadcast with the "breaking news"
that a school bus driver reportedly had been shot. The chase was on
as news vans raced up Highway 99 to Madera in a tight convoy.</TE>
<TE>   The local ABC station arrived first. Minutes later the NBC
affiliate and Channel 47 arrived in a virtual dead heat. Crews from
both stations extended the satellite poles from their vans.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Channel 47 was about to go live on the air, the other crew
powered up, cutting off the station's signal.</TE>
<TE>   Back in the newsroom, Burke and a knot of engineers and managers
watched helplessly as the picture dissolved into static. "Channel 24
is knocking us out," cried one news producer. "They're knocking us
off the air!"</TE>
<TE>   Although frustrated himself, Burke consoled the troops.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to win and everyone is hustling really hard, and then
some technical snafu happens," Burke said. "It might not be as
aggressive here as it is in Los Angeles, but we're still about trying
to get the information to the viewer and get it on the air first."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the bus driver had been grazed by a pellet that a
youth had launched with a slingshot.</TE>
<TE>   The station also has gone through three ownership changes in the
last three years.</TE>
<TE>   Ackerly Communications, which owns the Seattle Supersonics, sold
the station last summer to Clear Channel Communications Inc. Clear
Channel executives, recognizing the growth potential of the Fresno
market, vows to spend more on equipment so Channel 47 can become a
contender as it moves toward its 50th anniversary next fall.</TE>
<TE>   The station soon will be able to hire another cameraman to
complement its newest addition, reporter Ash.</TE>
<TE>   Ash, who worked in Pittsburgh before moving to Fresno, knows what
it's like to be on the other side of the divide, where there is money
for advisors and overnight ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "In those markets, they'd take the numbers so seriously -- it was
like the gospel," Ash said.</TE>
<TE>   In the morning, she recalled, the news executives would be
clustered around the printouts. "You'd know right away who was going
to be in a good mood that day."</TE>
<TE>   In Fresno, she said, "it's competitive but it's not
slash-the-tires-of-the-other-news-crews competitive."</TE>

<HD>United Pilots Offer Assurance to Fliers</HD>
<DH>Employees tell travelers the airline will continue flying
despite financial status. It is expected to file for reorganization.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times staff and wire reports</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>United Airlines' pilots union urged travelers Sunday not to abandon
the world's No. 2 carrier as it prepares to seek federal Bankruptcy
Court protection. The carrier's parent, UAL Corp., was expected to
file for reorganization today, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The Chapter 11 filing would be the largest airline bankruptcy in
U.S. history and among the nation's largest bankruptcies.</LD>
<LD>   The filing would put a federal judge in charge of overseeing the
tangled financial affairs of Oak Grove Village, Ill.-based United,
which has been unable to stop more than two years of swelling losses
and was rejected last week by the federal government for a
$1.8-billion loan guarantee.</LD>
<TE>   United, the largest carrier operating at Los Angeles International
and San Francisco International airports, operates about 1,700
flights a day, or about 20% of all U.S. flights.</TE>
<TE>   It plans to continue flying under bankruptcy protection. A
reorganization in Bankruptcy Court probably would result in fewer
flights, thousands of additional layoffs and other extensive
cost-slashing.</TE>
<TE>   United spokesman Joe Hopkins declined to comment and said the
airline would have no announcement Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   A source close to the company, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, told Associated Press the filing would be in Chicago today
but would not provide other details.</TE>
<TE>   The company's board of directors met in a special weekend session
to discuss United's emergency. Hopkins would not confirm that the
board, which recessed late Saturday, was in session again Sunday. But
a union source, who declined to be named, said the board reconvened
Sunday. United's unions have two seats on the board.</TE>
<TE>   United has 83,000 employees, including 6,500 in California.
Employees control 55% of the company.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders have told their members a bankruptcy filing is
imminent and unavoidable, and Chief Executive Glenn Tilton has told
employees it was becoming "a more likely outcome."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, United's employees Sunday sought to reassure customers
that the airline would continue flying despite its financial status.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after takeoff Sunday from Chicago's O'Hare International
Airport, 747 Capt. John Willis bluntly addressed passengers aboard
Flight 121 en route to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "No doubt you've read about the possibility of United filing for
bankruptcy," he said. "It's simply a financial operation. As far as
you're concerned, it should make no difference whatsoever.</TE>
<TE>   "We will keep flying for many years to come, and we will be here
as long as you will," Willis added.</TE>
<TE>   The airline's ability to serve its most loyal customers was on the
mind of Guido Bahler of Benlomond, Calif., who has accrued 400,000
frequent-flier miles as a business traveler.</TE>
<TE>   "United has always been good to me," Bahler said while waiting to
board a flight to Denver with his wife and child at O'Hare. "I hope
they'll pull through."</TE>
<TE>   The company sent an e-mail message to its frequent-flier holders
with assurances that members could continue to "accrue and redeem
miles with confidence."</TE>
<TE>   "Challenging times make a company stronger, leaner and more
focused," United marketing executive Chris Bowers said in his e-mail
to customers.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Sunday, United finished arrangements for $1.5 billion in
financing needed to keep flying while in bankruptcy protection,
people familiar with the situation said.</TE>
<TE>   The total amount of the so-called debtor-in-possession financing
remained fixed at $1.5 billion, but at the final hour, GE Capital
pulled out of the group of lenders and was replaced by CIT Group, the
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The other three lenders are J.P. Morgan Chase, Citibank and Bank
One, they said. Bank One, based in Chicago, will take the heaviest
exposure at $600 million. Of that, half is a separate credit line and
half is its share of the remaining $1.2 billion divided equally among
the four institutions.</TE>
<TE>   United has enough resources to operate throughout bankruptcy
protection but needs to swiftly cut further costs, said Ray Neidl, an
airline analyst for New York-based Blaylock &amp; Partners.</TE>
<TE>   "If this thing keeps dragging on a long time it will mean the loss
of customers and considerable resources," he said.</TE>
<TE>   United also has hired two high-profile public relations firms to
help it present a bankruptcy filing in the best possible light and to
encourage passengers to fly the airline.</TE>
<TE>   United proposed $5.2 billion in labor cutbacks by 2008 in its
pitch to the government, but the three-member Air Transportation
Stabilization Board found the business plan was not financially
sound.</TE>
<TE>   The carrier's shares fell 7 cents to 93 cents Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Dispute With USA Complicates Vivendi Reorganization</HD>
<DH>Media giant says it's working to resolve the tax-liability
issue with Barry Diller's e-commerce company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A thorny tax dispute with Barry Diller's USA Interactive is adding
another layer of complication to Vivendi Universal Chief Executive
Jean-Rene Fourtou's plans to reorganize and possibly spin off the Los
Angeles-based entertainment group.</LD>
<LD>   The dispute surfaced Friday when USA Interactive, the electronic
commerce company, accused Vivendi's U.S. entertainment division of
reneging on an agreement to cover its tax payments. Vivendi this year
paid $11 billion for a 5.4% stake in USA's entertainment assets,
which include Universal Studios, and formed Vivendi Universal
Entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   USA contends that Vivendi agreed to cover taxes stemming from the
transaction. The tax liabilities reportedly are valued at as much as
$620 million over 20 years.</LD>
<TE>   "USA has advised Vivendi that the contract language is entirely
clear on this point and, in fact, was the subject of negotiation
between the parties," according to USA's filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. "USA has asked VUE and Vivendi to
acknowledge the obligations expressly set forth in the agreement."</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi shot back Sunday, saying it "disagrees with USA's
interpretation of their partnership" with respect to the tax
obligations. The Paris-based conglomerate added in a statement that
"various matters related to the VUE partnership agreement are
currently the subject of review, discussion and negotiation between
the parties."</TE>
<TE>   A Vivendi spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the statement.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou told analysts last week that Vivendi is busy trying to
remove restrictions that limit his ability to sell or spin off the
U.S. entertainment group. Diller negotiated the restrictions when he
sold to Vivendi his USA entertainment assets, which, in addition to
the studio and theme parks, include the USA and Sci-Fi cable
channels.</TE>
<TE>   The tax dispute casts a spotlight on Diller's unusual dual roles
as a Vivendi executive and as a business partner. The media mogul
essentially sits on both sides of the fence in the dispute because he
is chief executive of USA Interactive, which operates such businesses
as Ticketmaster and Expedia.com, and is co-chief executive with
Fourtou of the newly reorganized U.S. entertainment group. Although
Diller does not have an employment contract with Vivendi, he owns
1.5% of the U.S. partnership.</TE>
<TE>   The dust-up also underscores the increasingly complex and murky
relationship between Diller and Fourtou, who rescued Vivendi this
summer after it nearly filed for bankruptcy protection due to
crippling debts from costly acquisitions, including the Universal
entertainment operations.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou has sent mixed signals on his partnership with Diller.
Fourtou, who has admitted to knowing little about the entertainment
industry, has made it clear he needs Diller to help him manage the
Universal movie studio, theme parks and record labels and prepare
them for a possible spinoff into a separately traded company next
year. Diller has been working on such a plan for months, company
sources say.</TE>
<TE>   But Fourtou also has stressed that he will not be solely dependent
on Diller and will consider other options, including selling the
Universal entertainment group.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi rebuffed a $13-billion offer by billionaire Marvin Davis
for its entertainment assets but will meet with Davis next month,
company sources say.</TE>

<CX>   Vivendi Universal -- An article in Monday's Business section
incorrectly stated that Vivendi Universal paid $11 billion for a 5.4%
stake in USA Interactive's entertainment assets, which included
Universal Studios. Vivendi paid about $11 billion for USA
Interactive's entertainment assets, which were combined with
Vivendi's Universal Studios to create a partnership called Vivendi
Universal Entertainment. The transaction also gave USA Interactive a
5.4% equity stake in the partnership.</CX>

<LD>Los Angeles County's infamously tax-averse voters surprised everyone
by approving a property tax increase last month to keep the county's
overburdened trauma and emergency-care system operating. The vote may
also have created the momentum to salvage the rest of the county's
troubled health-care system.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis called a news conference two weeks ago to announce
that state and county officials had finally agreed on a request for
federal aid for the network of hospitals and clinics that serves the
county's huge low-income population. The Bush administration had
resisted working with just the county, insisting that the state get
on board. Now that it has, federal Medicare and Medicaid Director Tom
Scully is scheduled to talk with local officials today.</LD>
<LD>   The state and county are asking the federal government to waive
certain rules on how the state may spend federal Medicaid dollars.
The county received a waiver in 1995 and again in 2000 to get through
an earlier crisis. The federal aid, however, tapers off each year;
that decline would leave the county with a deficit of hundreds of
millions of dollars by 2005.</LD>
<TE>   As the tale is usually told, the county is in so much trouble now
because it failed to make the reforms called for in the earlier
bailouts. By shifting patients from costly hospitals to less
expensive outpatient care, the county was supposed to save money that
could then be used to keep the system running without additional
federal help. The savings didn't materialize. But a respected study
confirms that the county did make reforms. A 2001 evaluation by the
Washington-based Urban Institute cited new public-private clinics,
reduced emergency room use, a reduction of hospital beds and improved
efficiency. What prevented the expected savings was the sheer number
of new people without medical insurance seeking care at county-run
clinics and hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "Absent some broad federal or state health reforms that
substantially reduce the number of uninsured in Los Angeles," the
report said, "the demands on the county to meet the health-care needs
of its low-income population are enormous."</TE>
<TE>   The new waiver requests are based on programs that the Bush
administration already has approved elsewhere, allowing more
flexibility in the use of federal dollars to treat the poor.
Admittedly, these would be short-term fixes that would not begin to
touch the problem of 6 million Californians without medical
insurance, more than 2 million in Los Angeles County alone. The
county cannot begin to fix that on its own. With a helping hand,
however, it can keep the system afloat until the nation begins a
much-needed debate on a broken health-care system.</TE>

<LD>The Bush administration's outright rejection of the Kyoto treaty on
global warming, the International Criminal Court and the
Antiballistic Missile Treaty with Russia has earned it the label
"unilateralist" and the image of the lone gunslinger. But even the
superpower atop the globe sometimes needs allies, especially when it
wants to fight an international war against terrorism. It is
important to understand the concerns of nations whose help the United
States seeks in tracking down terrorist cells, freezing their funds
and bringing their members to justice.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, the Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press
brought some mixed news. Its survey of more than 38,000 people in 44
nations found sympathy for the United States after the attacks on the
Pentagon and World Trade Center but increasing discontent with U.S.
policies and attitudes. In 80% of the nations, most people viewed the
United States and its citizens favorably. However, in the Middle East
and Central Asia, perceptions were on the negative side.</LD>
<LD>   The research organization said opinions about the United States
were "complicated and contradictory," embracing some aspects of
America but decrying its influence. Typical of this was an Egyptian
businessman who said he envied U.S. residents their democracy but was
tired of seeing U.S. movies and fast-food restaurants all over Cairo.</LD>
<TE>   Differences over Iraq are stark, with a majority of those
questioned outside the United States believing that Saddam Hussein is
not a threat and that the main U.S. motive in threatening invasion is
control of Iraqi oil.</TE>
<TE>   A lone superpower, no matter how benign, generous and cooperative,
cannot fail to attract envy and discontent. But that is not the whole
story. Washington has to be more willing to engage other governments
and their citizens. That does not necessarily lead to policy changes,
but it does mean staying at the table through disagreements over
global warming treaties and the International Criminal Court. It is
better to keep the dialogue going, explain U.S. objections and try to
solve problems</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell did just that in the Security
Council debate on sending weapons inspectors back to Iraq, repeatedly
telephoning his counterparts to outline the U.S. position and seek
support. In contrast, the "my way or the highway" approach of some
others in the administration angers allies as well as foes and may
increase reluctance to provide troops in Afghanistan, freeze Al Qaeda
bank accounts and share the results of interrogation of terrorism
suspects. The U.S. must say explicitly that it needs and appreciates
the help of others.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has helped Muslims in Bosnia and Kosovo; it
provides assistance to Palestinians and others worldwide. Telling
that story while listening to other nations can increase
understanding of the United States and reduce global discontent with
its necessary leadership.</TE>

<HD>Clearing the Air at the Ports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ill wind blowing through the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles
comes from container ships that each day belch tons of diesel
particulate matter and gases. In addition to being inhaled by the
ports' immediate neighbors, the fouled air moves inland dozens of
miles to cast a pall over millions. So a proposal that could
noticeably cut emissions from ships docked at the ports is cause for
cheering, even if it is only a start.</LD>
<LD>   The ports are the local linchpin in international trade, which
anchors Southern California's economy by accounting for 420,000 jobs
across the region. Port operators and shipping lines foresee 6%
annual increases in the number of containers passing through the
ports. Good news for the economy but potentially bad for clean air.</LD>
<LD>   Cleaning up the waterfront is not an easy sell. There is a
worldwide glut of cargo ships, so cash-strapped owners resist buying
pollution-control devices. The United States can do little to force
foreign owners to clean up their diesel fleets. No single agency has
port jurisdiction, and international, federal, state, regional and
local authorities have not yet agreed on ways to act in concert.
Nobody, of course, wants to throttle back the region's most important
economic engine.</LD>
<TE>   Against that backdrop, any progress is notable. Executives at some
of the world's largest shipping lines are talking about shutting down
big ships' dirty diesel engines while the vessels are in port and
drawing power from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power
grid. Shipping lines could recoup their considerable equipment costs
through energy savings, the DWP would get a new customer and Southern
Californians could breathe easier.</TE>
<TE>   During his Friday "state of the harbor" address, L.A. Mayor James
K. Hahn promised that a third of the ports' own vehicles and
equipment would be replaced with lower-emissions alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Under financial incentives offered by the state and the South
Coast Air Quality Management District, tugboat owners are already
installing cleaner-burning diesel engines. Shipping lines are
eliminating two tons of emissions daily simply by slowing down ships
as they enter and leave the harbor. New federal regulations mean that
old diesel-powered trucks gradually will be replaced with cleaner
models.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, however, the ports are the region's single worst air
pollution problem. On an average day, 16 cargo ships anchored at the
ports release more smog-forming gases than 1 million cars.
Diesel-powered tugboats, yard tractors and trucks add to the
pollution mix.</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayers have poured tens of billions of dollars into
improvements at the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. The port's
operators, shipping lines, longshore workers and others with an
interest in the waterfront can return the favor by working with
regulatory agencies to clean up their act.</TE>

<HD>Bob Berg, 51; Saxophonist in Davis' Jazz Fusion Band</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Berg, a jazz saxophonist best known for his work in the Miles
Davis fusion band in the 1980s, was killed Thursday in a highway
accident in Amagansett, N.Y. He was 51.</LD>
<LD>   Berg's sport utility vehicle was struck by a concrete-hauling
truck that skidded across a snow-slicked road, police said. Berg was
pronounced dead at the scene. His wife, a passenger, suffered facial
lacerations.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Brooklyn, N.Y., Berg began studying classical piano at
age 6. He had switched to saxophone by 13, studying at the High
School for Performing Arts.</LD>
<TE>   He was admitted to the Juilliard School in 1968, where he studied
classical saxophone.</TE>
<TE>   His focus turned quickly to free-form jazz, where he was greatly
influenced by the work of John Coltrane.</TE>
<TE>   As the 1960s came to a close, Berg found work as a bebop player in
a band led by the organist Brother Jack McDuff. In the 1970s, he
played in groups led by the pianists Horace Silver and Cedar Walton.</TE>
<TE>   After several years with Walton, Berg joined Davis' jazz fusion
band, which mainly used electric instruments. The band drew on a
variety of idioms including rock, soul and funk.</TE>
<TE>   Several albums and tours came from the association with Davis,
which was followed by a solo recording career and a collaboration
with guitarist Mike Stern.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, Berg turned to acoustic jazz, playing in pianist
Chick Corea's quartet.</TE>
<TE>   Berg later formed his own quartet, which toured extensively in the
Caribbean and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Arja, and their two children, Berg is
survived by his mother and a brother.</TE>

<HD>Adele Jergens, 84; Blond Bombshell in Many Films</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adele Jergens, who played brassy platinum-blond bombshells and
film-noir femmes fatales in a string of B movies in the 1940s and
`50s, has died. She was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Jergens, who was a leading pinup during World War II, died Nov. 22
of undisclosed causes at her home in Camarillo.</LD>
<LD>   The former New York show girl primarily played leads and second
leads in 47 films, including "Ladies of the Chorus" opposite Marilyn
Monroe, "The Fuller Brush Man" starring Red Skelton, "The Dark Past"
with William Holden, and "Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible
Man."</LD>
<TE>   "Her image was always that of the tough chorus girl or gangster's
moll or the best friend of the lead," said Alex Gordon, a producer at
American International Pictures in the 1950s, who cast Jergens in
three pictures.</TE>
<TE>   "She was, you might say, a second-choice Joan Blondell type," said
Gordon. "In real life, she was just the opposite, a very sweet girl."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon used Jergens in Roger Corman's 1956 science-fiction film
"The Day the World Ended," starring Richard Denning, Lori Nelson and
Touch (Mike) Connors.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a good-hearted bad girl, the girlfriend of Mike Connors,"
said Gordon. "We got along so well together, I used her again in my
next picture, 'Girls in Prison,' " starring Denning and Joan Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   Film historian Alan Rode said Jergens developed a reputation as a
femme fatale in a handful of films noirs such as "Armored Car
Robbery," "Side Street" and "Try and Get Me."</TE>
<TE>   "She was one of the last links to the classic era of film-noir
movies," said Rode, who is writing a book about film-noir heavies and
had scheduled an interview with Jergens just before she died.</TE>
<TE>   "She was," Rode said, "part of a bygone era of burlesque girls and
men who wear fedoras -- an era where it was clear who wore the aprons
at home and served the martinis to their husbands and who were the
girls that the hard guys and bad men wanted to have."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1917, Jergens began dancing lessons at
9. Later dubbed "the girl with the million-dollar legs" by one of her
dancing teachers, she began working in the chorus at the Brooklyn Fox
Theater and as a Powers model.</TE>
<TE>   In 1939, she was named the Fairest of the Fair at the New York
World's Fair.</TE>
<TE>   Jergens, who also worked briefly as a Rockette, was named the No.
1 showgirl in New York at one point in the early '40s and received
her first break understudying burlesque stripteaser Gypsy Rose Lee in
the Broadway show "Star and Garter."</TE>
<TE>   "You know how those jobs are," Jergens said in 1948. "All I did
was stand around back- stage just in case Gypsy became ill. But those
things I thought only happen in the movies, where the understudy
proves to be a hit [and] wins a Hollywood contract ...."</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly what happened to Jergens. Spotted by a talent scout
when she filled in for the ailing Lee for two weeks, Jergens was
signed to a contract with Columbia Studios.</TE>
<TE>   She made her film debut with an uncredited role in "Together
Again" in 1944, then landed her first real part as a lead in a
Columbia serial called "Black Arrow."</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed "The Eyeful" by a studio publicist, Jergens made something
of a splash in 1945 with her first significant role, playing a
princess in "A Thousand and One Nights," starring Evelyn Keyes and
Cornel Wilde.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Times drama editor Edwin Schallert called Jergens "a
new and arresting personality in moviedom."</TE>
<TE>   In 1949, Jergens married actor Glenn Langan, her co-star in "The
Treasure of Monte Cristo." Jergens and Langan, who also appeared
together in the crime drama "The Big Chase" in 1954, were married
until Langan's death in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Their only child, a son named Tracy, died last year.</TE>

<HD>John W. Powers, 90; Legendary Officer in LAPD for 31 Years</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They called him Two-Gun Johnny. The Patton of the LAPD. A real cop's
cop.</LD>
<LD>   It says so in Joseph Wambaugh's best-seller "The Onion Field." He
was that well known.</LD>
<LD>   John William Powers, the third-generation street cop who spent 31
years with the Los Angeles Police Department in the rough-and-tumble
era from 1940 to 1971, has died. He was 90.</LD>
<TE>   Powers died Nov. 15 of cancer at his home in the little town of
Cool, Calif., not far from Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   He got the first nickname because of his bravado and derring-do in
his first year on the force.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 20, 1941, he was shot by a 15-year-old robber. Powers,
sure he was a goner, pulled out a second gun and killed his
assailant.</TE>
<TE>   For 20 years, he made it a habit to carry two guns. Everywhere.
Only in 1961 when he made the rank of inspector did he reduce his
arsenal to a single snub-nosed .38. And he carried a .45 in his
retirement, even to his daughters' weddings.</TE>
<TE>   Powers was called the Patton of the force, and a cop's cop, as
Wambaugh explained in his nonfiction book about the murder of LAPD
Officer Ian Campbell, because:</TE>
<TE>   "He was tall, like the general, with white wavy hair and eyebrows
like crow's wings. And Inspector Powers had the Patton charisma with
the line policemen, would talk their language at roll calls, would
brief stakeout squads and robbery teams in regard to shooting. A
good, clean bandit-killing pleased him as it does most policemen. He
was known as a cop's cop."</TE>
<TE>   He was in Wambaugh's book about the 1963 kidnapping of Campbell
and Officer Karl Hettinger and Campbell's murder in an onion field
near Bakersfield because of what he advised street cops to do
afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Controversial Memo</TE>
<TE>   Powers, who went to Bakersfield the night of the killing to
shepherd the investigation, wrote what came to be called "the
Hettinger Memorandum," which proved pretty controversial in the
ranks.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the edict was titled "Patrol Bureau Memorandum Number
11" and the subtitle or subject matter was "Rollcall Training --
Officer's Survival."</TE>
<TE>   What it said was never surrender or turn over your gun to "a
depraved criminal" as the two officers had done on a Hollywood side
street; try to distract the gunman to regain control of the
situation, take a hit if necessary, and always remember "if shot, all
wounds are not fatal."</TE>
<TE>   The language, which was written in the Cold War era, was tough and
typical Powers:</TE>
<TE>   "The police are engaged in a hot war. There are no truces, and
there is no hope of an armistice. The enemy abides by no rules of
civilized warfare.</TE>
<TE>   "The individual officer, when taking his oath of office, enters a
sacred trust to protect his community to the best of his ability,
laying down his life if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "All men return to dust. The manner of a man's living and dying is
of paramount importance. Although some moderns have attempted to sap
the strength and ideals of this nation by slogans such as 'I'd rather
be red than dead,' there are situations more intolerable than death."</TE>
<TE>   Many rank and file officers believed that the memo strongly
implied that Campbell could have prevented his own death and branded
both Campbell and Hettinger cowards.</TE>
<TE>   Hettinger, who was greatly troubled by the experience as he
testified through trial after trial that finally convicted and
imprisoned two men, left the force under a shoplifting cloud in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   But Powers did write from experience. Wounded in his one kill, he
wounded four other suspects in gun battles when he was on the
streets.</TE>
<TE>   64 Commendations</TE>
<TE>   In addition to working the Campbell murder case, he was a
commander during the 1965 Watts riots and helped lead the
investigation of the Charles Manson family murders of actress Sharon
Tate and six others in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   As he rose to lieutenant, captain in charge of Venice detective
and juvenile bureaus, internal affairs and Hollywood patrol
divisions, he earned 64 commendations.</TE>
<TE>   The last was for capturing kidnappers of a banker's son shortly
before his retirement on June 30, 1971, as commander in charge of
robbery-homicide.</TE>
<TE>   He received only one reprimand, and he issued it to himself -- for
driving a police car involved in a minor accident when he was captain
of internal affairs in 1959. His hobby was shooting -- marksmanship.</TE>
<TE>   And Powers was an experienced writer. His memos might have been
harsh but were always clear.</TE>
<TE>   He had written for "Dragnet" and in retirement penned his own --
unpublished -- 1,600 page autobiography, "Officer Survival."</TE>
<TE>   Family Trade</TE>
<TE>   Powers was born and reared in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., where his father
was a cop for 36 years. His grandfather was a policeman for 21 years
in nearby Newburgh, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   (Carrying on the family line, Powers' grandson, Robert Harwood, is
an officer with the San Francisco Police Department.)</TE>
<TE>   He moved to Los Angeles in 1939 and waited out the one-year
residency requirement to join the LAPD by working as bodyguard for
Hollywood mogul Jack Warner.</TE>
<TE>   Powers and his wife relocated to Cool four years ago to be closer
to their daughters. He dazzled El Dorado County Sheriff Hal Barker by
signing up for his Sheriff's Team of Active Retirees. Powers also
joined the Sacramento Area Blue Line Assn., a group of former LAPD
officers living near the state capital.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 66 years, Grace; two daughters,
Kathryn Powers and Carol Harwood of Cool, and one grandson.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the
William H. Parker Foundation's Canine Equipment Fund, 1880 N. Academy
Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90012.</TE>

<HD>Tired of Swimming Upstream, Salmon Farmer Moving On</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth R. Weiss</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TOFINO, Canada</DL>
<LD>Bill Vernon, one of British Columbia's pioneering salmon farmers,
cannot wait to escape the business.</LD>
<LD>   For 18 years, the founder of Creative Salmon has weathered Pacific
storms that can rip apart nets and empty his investment into the sea.
He has survived algae blooms that can wipe out an entire year's crop
in hours.</LD>
<LD>   He has struggled to control parasites and diseases. He has battled
marauding sea lions and fended off European conglomerates that have
gobbled up most of the region's independent salmon farmers.</LD>
<TE>   Yet it was another threat, one from his own community, that pushed
him to retire just shy of his 50th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "I shot a bunch of sea lions a few years ago," Vernon said. "I've
had people phoning and threatening to kill me and my family. It's
worn me out."</TE>
<TE>   Vernon is a casualty of growing friction in British Columbia over
salmon farms. The irony of Vernon's departure is that he has worked
hard to solve -- or avoid -- many of the ecological problems that
have plagued salmon farms.</TE>
<TE>   He rejects the idea of raising Atlantic salmon in Pacific waters.
His company is one of the few that grows native chinook salmon, even
though they are not as profitable as the faster-growing Atlantic
species.</TE>
<TE>   "If the MBAs were looking at this operation," he jokes, "they
would say, 'What are you doing?' "</TE>
<TE>   He packs fewer fish in each pen than the industry average to
reduce disease, pests and mortality. He has stopped using pesticides
and cut back on antibiotics. "This year, we harvested a million and a
half fish," Vernon said, "and none of them have had antibiotics."</TE>
<TE>   He rids his nets of algae and mussels through labor-intensive
scrubbing, rather than soaking the nets in copper sulfate and
contributing to the buildup of toxic copper on the sea floor.</TE>
<TE>   He regularly tests his salmon feed to avoid elevated levels of
cancer-causing PCBs or toxic dioxins. He has installed perimeter nets
around his farms to keep sea lions away. That way, his crews no
longer have to shoot them to protect the caged salmon.</TE>
<TE>   He was vilified after his workers shot sea lions, which is legal
in Canada. A local environmental group, Friends of Clayoquot Sound,
published gruesome photos of a burial pit with more than a dozen of
the marine mammals.</TE>
<TE>   Vernon says he was targeted because he obeyed the law, burying the
carcasses on land rather than leaving them to disappear in the ocean
as some other farmers do.</TE>
<TE>   "I had an environmental group say to me, 'It's too bad it was you.
You are one of the good guys.' "</TE>
<TE>   Vernon has been a vocal critic of industry practices.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry has made huge improvements, but can make much, much
more," he said. "If Atlantic salmon farmers want to continue, they
need to take current standards and raise them."</TE>
<TE>   Vernon believes salmon farming will never be wholly organic. It's
too difficult to control every aspect of farming the sea. Nor, he
said, will fish raised in pens ever match those from the wild -- in
taste, appearance or quality.</TE>
<TE>   "We just can't," he said. "We are going to end up with a higher
fat fish. The [caged] fish just don't get as much exercise as wild
salmon."</TE>
<TE>   Vernon still believes that farmed salmon are needed more than
ever, as wild stocks decline and the global appetite for salmon
increases.</TE>
<TE>   He has sold his company to his employees and leaves with a mixture
of pride in his business and sorrow over tensions with the community.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Vernon's efforts have not gone unrewarded. Whole Foods Market,
the largest U.S. retailer of natural foods, sells Creative Salmon's
chinook fillets in some of its stores.</TE>
<TE>   "We look for the most eco-friendly methods available," said Kate
Lowrey-Monteilh of Whole Foods. "We embrace those vendors who can
give us those options."</TE>

<LD>The home and belongings of a couple and their daughter who were
killed in August were auctioned by relatives to pay family debts.
About 250 participants observed a moment of silence for Michael and
Mary Short and 9-year-old Jennifer before starting bidding.</LD>
<LD>   The couple were found dead in their Bassett home Aug. 15. Jennifer
was missing until Sept. 24, when her remains were found in North
Carolina. The case remains unsolved.</LD>
<LD>   The auction raised about $140,000 to pay off back taxes and other

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Researchers have counted more than 14,000 birds killed by avian
botulism along Lake Erie this year, possibly the deadliest outbreak
since the disease was discovered here four years ago. Wildlife
officials said the toll in Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio and Ontario,
Canada, is probably much higher, because agencies are collecting only
a fraction of birds that die.</LD>
<LD>   The worst of the outbreak should be over, because colder weather
has arrived and the birds most prone to botulism -- such as loons and
mergansers -- are migrating, a researcher said.</LD>

<LD>Security guards at the Indian Point nuclear plant in Westchester

said there was no encouragement to raise security concerns. "Only 19%
of the security officers stated that they could adequately defend the
plant after the terrorist event of Sept. 11," said a report conducted
for Entergy Nuclear Northeast, which owns the plant's two active

<LD>   The report also said 59% of guards described a "chilled

<HD>Bush Rebuilds Economic Team</HD>
<DH>Democrats focus on pocketbook issues, saying tax cuts for
the wealthy would squander resources needed for the war on terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Judy Pasternak</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>While the White House prepared to names choices as early as today to
replace two ousted members of the administration's economic team,
Democrats took aim Sunday at the upper-bracket tax cuts at the heart
of President Bush's economic policy -- saying the country needs
resources to fight the war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Former Goldman Sachs Chairman Stephen Friedman is the likely
successor to Lawrence O. Lindsey as White House economic advisor. And
Bush has chosen CSX Corp. Chairman John W. Snow as Treasury
secretary, succeeding Paul H. O'Neill, administration sources told
the Washington Post late Sunday. Other news organizations confirmed
the report.</LD>
<LD>   Lindsey and O'Neill were abruptly forced out Friday.</LD>
<TE>   The shakeup is "long overdue," Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.) said on CNN's "Late Edition." But, he added, "simply
changing the team if you don't change the plan doesn't do anything at
all."</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials said last week that the president needed
better salespeople for his policies. On Sunday, a Commerce Department
spokesman, Trevor Francis, said that although the economy is weak,
Bush's tax cut had prevented an even worse slide.</TE>
<TE>   "To think that we've had 3 1/2% growth a little over a year after
the attack on our country and the stock market responding to
corporate misfeasance, it's almost remarkable where we are today," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "the economy can use an insurance policy, and Bush and
[Vice President Dick] Cheney are well aware of that," another source
said.</TE>
<TE>   The White House is expected to announce soon a package of stimulus
proposals that would make its income tax cuts permanent and possibly
speed up decreases that were to phase in later in the decade. A
number of "investor-friendly" moves, such as reduced taxes on
dividends and cushioning capital losses, are also being considered.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, meanwhile, linked the economy to the security issue
that Republicans wielded so powerfully in the midterm elections. Sen.
Jon Corzine (D-N.J.) said on "Fox News Sunday" that "Democrats should
make sure we have resources to protect the American people," and
warned against "governments with huge deficits."</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the first times we've been at war that we haven't
asked for sacrifice," Corzine added.</TE>
<TE>   On the same show, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) called for
"some investment in public works too, including particularly homeland
security money to the states and localities."</TE>
<TE>   On the Sunday talk shows, Democrats said any short-term tax cuts
to get consumers spending again should be targeted toward the working
and middle classes rather than the wealthy.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.), who won reelection Saturday, told Fox
that "95% of the people in Louisiana have household incomes of under
$75,000. So when I fashion a tax cut with the president, I've got
those people in mind."</TE>
<TE>   Former Vice President Al Gore said on ABC's "This Week" that the
Bush administration "drained $1.3 trillion out of revenues with this
current plan" and added: "The rich have been getting richer and I
don't begrudge them that, but the poor have been getting poorer."</TE>
<TE>   He suggested repealing tax cuts for the wealthy that are "yet to
occur" and canceling the scheduled elimination of the inheritance tax
while increasing the exemption.</TE>
<TE>   The White House will probably not take the recommendations that
the opposition party floated over the airwaves Sunday, but the
administration recognizes that Democratic votes may be needed,
especially in the Senate, to get its plan passed, said one source.</TE>
<TE>   Corzine, who worked with Friedman at Goldman Sachs, described the
presumed White House economic advisor as "a pragmatist, not an
ideologue" who is "interested in long-term fiscal stability in this
country."</TE>
<TE>   The White House post, unlike the nomination for Treasury
secretary, does not need Senate confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   Snow, 63, who was a Transportation Department official in the Ford
administration, is chairman, president and chief executive of CSX, a
freight and transportation conglomerate based in Richmond, Va. The
firm runs the largest rail freight network in the eastern U.S. Since
O'Neill's ouster Friday, the White House was said to be looking for a
successor with knowledge of how government works, a strong economics
background and good communication skills.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Snow, another possibility was said to be Gerald L. Parsky,
a Los Angeles financier who co-chaired Bush's campaign in California
and was rumored to be in the running when Bush first took office.
Another Californian mentioned was Charles Schwab, founder of the
brokerage that bears his name.</TE>
<TE>   Another on the list was Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, a
longtime friend of Bush who spent the weekend with him at Camp David.
Evans, said his spokesman, "enjoys his job as secretary of Commerce
and looks forward to continuing to work as a member of the
president's economic team as well as a member of the Cabinet."</TE>

<LD>   The achievements of conductor James Levine, actress and dancer
Chita Rivera, singer and songwriter Paul Simon, actress Elizabeth
Taylor and actor James Earl Jones were celebrated at the 25th annual
Kennedy Center Honors.</LD>
<LD>   "Each one of you is known to the American people in a way that
runs deeper than fame," President Bush told the honorees at a White
House reception Sunday. "Each new group represents a picture to
remember -- a conductor from the Met, a legend from Broadway, the
composer of 'Mrs. Robinson,' the face of Cleopatra and the voice of
Darth Vader."</LD>
<TE>   After hosting the reception at the White House, Bush and his wife,
Laura, attended a gala celebration at Washington's Kennedy Center.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Hollywood and political heavyweights attended a
black-tie reception and dinner at the State Department, hosted by
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.</TE>
<TE>   After dining on hickory-smoked salmon, golden corn risotto and
chocolate cake, Powell paid tribute to the awardees. He began by
comparing diplomacy and the performing arts:</TE>
<TE>   "At its very best, diplomacy, like art, extends the realm of the
possible. Each in their own way, American diplomacy and our
performing artists have opened up new ways of proceeding and
thinking. They have reached across cultures and borders."</TE>
<TE>   Powell also teased the honorees.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, 71, whose first movie was Stanley Kubrick's 1964 classic
"Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the
Bomb," is perhaps best known for his voice work as Darth Vader in the
"Star Wars" movies and King Mufasa in Disney's "The Lion King."</TE>
<TE>   Jones "has been an inspiration to young people around the world,
so much so that Warner Bros. wanted to make a movie of his life. They
put it off, though -- I wasn't available," Powell quipped.</TE>
<TE>   Rivera, who played Anita in the Broadway production of "West Side
Story," appeared in the film "Kiss of the Spider Woman" and performed
with the School of American Ballet.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, 59, who has won a dozen Grammys and is a two-time inductee
into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, was honored for his multifaceted
musical career, bringing elements as wide-ranging as traditional
African rhythms, rockabilly and salsa into his songs.</TE>
<TE>   Levine, 58, was recognized for "bringing one of the world's
foremost opera companies to unsurpassed artistic excellence." The
longtime artistic director of the Metropolitan Opera will take over
the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, 70, was recognized by actress Glenn Close for her prolific
career and commitment to AIDS research. "She commanded the screen
with unparalleled power ... and she used her power to help the less
fortunate, lending her money, her time, her passion, to causes most
in need of her help," Close said.</TE>

<HD>Much of N. Carolina Remains Powerless</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ken Ellingwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Their cherished trees had fallen to pieces, but residents were trying
not to do the same Sunday as storm-related power outages stretched
into a fourth day across much of North Carolina.</LD>
<LD>   As crews labored around the clock to remove fallen limbs and fix
power lines toppled during last week's ice storms, residents relied
on their neighbors and their own wiles to cope with blackouts that
may last a few days more. Those who could afford it went to hotels,
while others bunked down at the homes of fortunate friends or huddled
under an extra blanket or two against the chilly temperatures.</LD>
<LD>   At the home of Mildred Jeffries in the Wesley Heights
neighborhood, a fireplace in a tiny back room now was heater and
cooking stove in one. On Saturday, as the temperature outside
approached 20 degrees, 10 friends and relatives spent the night
packed snugly onto blankets in front of the fireplace. Making use of
a barbecue grill's metal grate and a trusted iron skillet, Jeffries,
a 50-year-old home care worker, kept three generations of loved ones
fed with steaks, rice and eggs cooked over the open flames.</LD>
<TE>   "We're making it," Jeffries said as a cheery fire glowed Sunday
afternoon. "I'm the oldest of 12, so I'm a survivor."</TE>
<TE>   The hardest hit areas in Charlotte were the older sections near
downtown -- where many of the city's venerable, century-old oaks
broke under the weight of the ice, raining thick limbs onto rooftops,
cars and power lines. By Sunday, neighborhoods such as Dilford were
still without power as tree workers lopped damaged limbs from
towering water oaks. The streets were lined with piles of bare
branches and overhead, many broken limbs still dangled precariously.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte calls itself "the city of trees" and even has an
ordinance to keep builders from clear-cutting to make way for new
developments. The cooling canopies are a stately feature of Dilford
and a handful of other neighborhoods. During the ice storm, those
limbs abruptly became menaces, slashing through utility lines like a
guillotine's blade. The storm has resurrected debate about the
virtues of burying utility cables.</TE>
<TE>   An army of utility workers, including more than 4,000 from 15
other states, gained ground Sunday in the battle to clear debris and
repair lines toppled by the storm, which hit with a malevolence not
seen here since Hurricane Hugo hit in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Duke Power, serving portions of both Carolinas, said
crews had restored electricity in 100,000 homes and businesses
Sunday, leaving fewer than 500,000 without power. That was down from
a peak of 1.3 million customers who lacked power after the storm.
Duke, which said the blackout was worse than that resulting from
Hugo, expected to have service restored almost everywhere by
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In the Raleigh-Durham area, the utility CP&amp;L reported that 116,000
customers remained without services -- down from a high of 464,000.
"It's been difficult because of the cold, but we've made tremendous
progress," company spokeswoman Jean McCormack said.</TE>
<TE>   The storm's death toll rose as authorities in Charlotte reported
that a 38-year-old woman died from carbon monoxide poisoning Sunday
after she burned charcoal in the fireplace of her apartment. The
woman, who was described as an immigrant from Sierra Leone in Western
Africa, was at least the third person statewide to have succumbed to
carbon monoxide. More than 200 other people across the state were
treated for inhaling carbon monoxide as a result of using charcoal or
gas grills or kerosene burners indoors.</TE>
<TE>   Officials tried to spread the word among immigrants about the
perils of carbon monoxide. At the police dispatch center in
Charlotte, authorities used a computerized system to call thousands
of homes in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods with a Spanish-language
message.</TE>
<TE>   In Lincoln County, a utility worker from Florida was killed when
his service truck overturned. Five others died since the storm from
other causes.</TE>
<TE>   A state of emergency was still in place in both Carolinas. North
Carolina Gov. Mike Easley mobilized 300 National Guard troops to
knock on doors in search of people needing help. Schools in the
Charlotte area were to remain closed and 400 people sought warmth in
four Red Cross shelters set up in area schools.</TE>
<TE>   At one shelter, about 124 elderly and disabled residents slept on
cots and hospital beds. Johnny Johnson, 40 and with severely limited
vision, said he fled his apartment when the blackout hit and had not
been back. "It was definitely cold," he said.</TE>
<TE>   City workers today were to begin cleaning up an estimated 750,000
cubic tons of fallen branches and snapped trunks -- the equivalent of
30 acres piled 15 feet deep. Residents like Jeffries were making the
most of what nature provided. Her son sawed up a massive limb that
narrowly missed the house. The chunks would keep the blaze going in
her fireplace-cum-kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   "God blessed me twice. [The limb] didn't hit the house and he
blessed me with wood," Jeffries said.</TE>
<TE>   Down the street, Samuel Ford sounded flustered. The blackout
already had cost him two days' work as a shelving installer -- one of
them was payday -- and he had to spend $35 on batteries and candles.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of even one more day in his frigid house was
"depressing," Ford said. But there was little to be done about it. "I
guess I'll try to stay sane and do the best I can."</TE>

<HD>Anger at Boston Cardinal Builds at Home While He's at
Vatican</HD>
<DH>Hundreds turn out to call for Law's removal after a week of
new disclosures in sex abuse scandal. But he wasn't there to hear
them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Mehren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Outside the stately Cathedral of the Holy Cross on Sunday, hundreds
of angry demonstrators heaped vitriol on the church most of them were
raised in. Brandishing posters of youthful sexual abuse victims, they
spoke of disappointment, betrayal and even criminal complicity on the
part of the leaders of this city's Roman Catholic archdiocese. They
chanted, alternating peals of "Law must go!" with forceful cries of
"Indict Law now, throw the bum out!"</LD>
<LD>   But the leader of Boston's 2.1 million Catholics heard none of the
entreaties. Cardinal Bernard Law, a church spokeswoman said Sunday,
was at the Vatican. "I can confirm that the cardinal is in Rome,"
said Donna Morrissey. She declined to say when the prelate had
departed, when he would return or what the nature of his visit was.</LD>
<LD>   It was at least the second sudden trip to Rome by Law since calls
for his resignation started soon after the clerical sexual abuse
scandal erupted in January. In April, Law paid a secret visit to Pope
John Paul II to offer his resignation as head of one of the largest
archdioceses in the United States. The pontiff urged Law to remain in
his post and tough out the crisis.</LD>
<TE>   But with new revelations about clerical misconduct, demands that
the cardinal step down dramatically escalated during the last week. A
vote by diocesan leaders to authorize the church here to file for
bankruptcy also fueled calls for Law's ouster.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, a group of priests drafted a letter urging Law
to quit. A copy of the letter, published in the Boston Globe, said:
"The priests and the people of Boston have lost confidence in you as
their spiritual leader."</TE>
<TE>   Morrissey said that she had not seen the letter and did not know
whether it had been delivered to the cardinal. On the second Sunday
of Advent, no explanation was offered for Law's absence at the
cathedral where he traditionally celebrates Mass.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very disappointed. I thought Cardinal Law would have the
courage to face us," said Anne Coughlin, who drove down from New
Hampshire to attend Mass at the parish she was raised in. When she
realized the cardinal would not be present, Coughlin made a sign that
said: "How can you lead us if you can't even face us?" Cathedral
ushers told her to roll it up and keep it out of view.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal's abrupt departure for Rome capped a week that
wracked this already beleaguered archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   First, thousands of pages of previously secret church personnel
documents were released -- revealing that priests here gave drugs to
young parishioners, seduced girls who were studying to become nuns,
led double lives with women and, in one case, threw a housekeeper
down the stairs. One day later, church finance leaders said the
archdiocese could file for bankruptcy to avoid almost 500 sexual
abuse lawsuits pending against it. Next, another once-secret file
showed that a priest here had fathered two children and failed to
seek prompt medical help when their mother suffered a fatal drug
overdose in his presence.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal then informed a group of priests that they could not
meet at a parish in suburban Newton, Mass., to discuss fundraising in
the face of the abuse crisis. They met anyway, and by Saturday, at
least 50 Boston priests reportedly had signed a petition calling for
Law's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   It was Father Walter Cuenin, the outspoken pastor at Our Lady Help
of Christians, who organized Friday's meeting of dozens of priests
who question how they can ask for donations when the abuse crisis has
seethed for close to a year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is pretty clear that the leadership of the bishop is
so compromised that he must resign," Cuenin said. "I don't see how he
can continue. It is regrettable, because he has done good things."</TE>
<TE>   From his pulpit in the vibrant parish of 2,600 families, Cuenin
gazed out Sunday at a sanctuary where every pew was filled and
supporters stood three deep in the rear of the church. "See, this is
what happens when you get banned in Newton," Cuenin deadpanned.</TE>
<TE>   The church roared with laughter and -- in a gesture seldom seen at
church -- gave the priest a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Then Cuenin used his homily to blast "a church that hides behind
lawyers and bankruptcy judges." Catholics in Boston, he said, "are in
exile from our real church. We are hurting."</TE>
<TE>   In louder, more acerbic tones, much the same sentiment was
expressed by the demonstrators who marched outside Law's cathedral
while worshipers took Communion inside. Paul Kendrick, a stockbroker
who traveled from Maine to rally against the cardinal, said he
bristled when he heard a church leader speak disparagingly about
protesters.</TE>
<TE>   "I said: 'We are not protesters. We are Catholics,' " Kendrick
said. "We are an oppressed church right now. The people are
oppressed. The priests are oppressed. For ordinary Catholics, there
is only so much soul-sickness they can take. That is why we are out
here today."</TE>

<HD>Secret Work at Cheney's House Rattles Neighbors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Neighbors of Vice President Dick Cheney are being shaken and rattled
at least once a day by mysterious blasts at the U.S. Naval
Observatory where Cheney lives.</LD>
<LD>   The Navy says the explosions are part of a construction project
that has been going on for several months, but won't say more because
the project is classified.</LD>
<LD>   Navy spokeswoman Cate Mueller described the work as an
"infrastructure improvement, a utility upgrade."</LD>
<TE>   She said they have tried to reassure the neighborhood -- which
includes the Washington residence of former President Clinton and his
wife, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) -- that the blasts will
not damage their homes. She said most understand that, because of
national security concerns, they can't reveal details or confine the
construction to a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Rieser, who lives half a block off Observatory Circle, said
each blast was "almost like thunder because it rolls and it lasts a
noticeable period, probably several seconds." He said the explosions
rattle windows that aren't shut tight.</TE>
<TE>   Rieser said his concern was that neighbors received no warning of
the project. "If this were a normal construction contract I would
expect that they would have told the neighbors."</TE>
<TE>   Mueller acknowledged that they were "not as aggressive up front in
warning" neighbors about the project.</TE>
<TE>   She said the construction is expected to last eight more months,
and for the time being there will be one or two blasts a day, each
lasting about three to five seconds.</TE>
<TE>   The blasts were being carefully monitored to assure they were well
under acceptable vibration standards so there would be no damage to
nearby residences or to facilities at the observatory, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Naval Observatory moved to its current location on
Massachusetts Avenue in northwest Washington in 1893. It became the
official residence for the vice president in 1974.</TE>

<HD>Rising Number of Uninsured Is Causing Safety Net to Unravel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Roland Palencia first arrived as executive director of the
Clinica Monsignor Romero three years ago, about 10 to 15 new patients
turned up each day at the nonprofit health center in a heavily Latino
neighborhood just west of downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Lately, the clinic has been inundated with 40 to 50 new patients a
day -- gardeners, janitors, garment factory workers, all with health
needs. And almost all without health insurance.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, we are not able to absorb that kind of demand," says
Palencia, whose modest budget allows for only five doctors to staff
the clinic on each shift. "What it means is sometimes we set an
appointment three months later. Sometimes they have to wait to see if
somebody who already has a scheduled appointment does not show up.
They might not be seen until 3 p.m., even if they show up at 8 a.m.
And these are not people who are there to receive an award; they're
in pain to start with. It's not a comfortable situation to wait that
long."</LD>
<TE>   For the U.S. health-care system, the lines at Clinica Romero are
like the first waves reaching the shore as a storm approaches. The
Census Bureau reports that in 2001, the number of Americans without
health insurance jumped to 41.2 million, up 1.4 million from 2000.
All signs point to a bigger increase this year. "I would be amazed if
the number of uninsured in 2002 grew by less than 2 million," says
Dan Hawkins, vice president for policy at the National Assn. of
Community Health Centers.</TE>
<TE>   People without insurance still get sick, or hurt on the job, or
hit by cars. And when any of that happens, they turn up, bloody or
fevered, at the providers of last resort -- the public hospitals and
nonprofit community health clinics that comprise the safety net for
the uninsured. Sometimes they have to wait too long when they get
there. Many times they see a doctor who has never met them before.
But almost always they are treated, whether or not they can pay.</TE>
<TE>   The providers of last resort fund this care for the uninsured
through grants from federal and local governments, charitable
contributions and the revenue they earn from treating patients who
are covered under Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program
or, more rarely, private insurance. But this safety net is unraveling
under the pressure of the rising number of Americans without health
insurance. The system simply can't bear the weight of providing for
so many individuals who have no means of paying for their care.</TE>
<TE>   The experience of Los Angeles County offers a preview of what's
ahead for the safety net elsewhere if the ranks of the uninsured
continue to grow. It's not a pretty picture. For at least a decade,
the county's system of public hospitals and clinics has been on the
edge of calamity.</TE>
<TE>   The system is groaning under such enormous demand that emergency
rooms are frequently forced to turn away arriving ambulances for lack
of space. Yet funding shortfalls have forced the county to steadily
retrench its services.</TE>
<TE>   Only two bailouts from the Clinton administration prevented
massive cutbacks in the 1990s. The county was faced with the prospect
of closing trauma centers and two public hospitals -- the Harbor-UCLA
and Olive View-UCLA medical centers -- until voters last month
approved a ballot initiative raising property taxes to provide them
with more money. And even with that, the county has been compelled to
close clinics and downsize hospitals to save some $350 million. It
will need to cut much further if the state and the Bush
administration, which has been resistant, don't cough up an
additional $230 million in the next few months.</TE>
<TE>   Mismanagement and bad decisions contributed to this perpetual
crisis. As Jonathan Cohn recently wrote in a perceptive essay in the
New Republic, the county system "evolved haphazardly, beset by
corruption and inefficiency."</TE>
<TE>   But the core of the county's problem is that it is being asked to
treat an unsustainably large number of uninsured patients: At least
2.5 million people, more than one in every four county residents,
have no health coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "People say the county should be more efficient. You can do a
better job managing," says County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky. "Sure,
we can all do a better job managing. But there is a structural
problem. Clearly, the number of uninsured is paramount to all our
problems."</TE>
<TE>   In the coming months, safety net providers around the country will
face an even tighter squeeze. Payments from Medicaid, the joint
state-federal health care program for the poor, provide the largest
source of revenue for both public hospitals and community health
centers.</TE>
<TE>   But states are warning of "draconian" cuts in Medicaid as they try
to dig out from deepening budget deficits. This means that even as
the public providers are forced to offer more uncompensated care for
the uninsured, they will face reductions in their most reliable
source of revenue.</TE>
<TE>   There are no inexpensive answers to these dilemmas. Washington
could ease the sting of Medicaid cuts by providing states an
emergency increase in funding for the program; the Senate voted to do
that last summer, but both the House Republican majority and the Bush
administration are leery. Bush is more enthusiastic about bolstering
the 3,500 federally funded community health clinics, such as Clinica
Romero; he wants to add 1,200 more by 2006, and in each of his first
two budgets, he has invested significant dollars toward that goal.</TE>
<TE>   Yet while the safety net providers clearly need more direct aid,
in many respects that's like buying a better Band-Aid. Even the
providers themselves recognize that the system can't be stabilized
without guaranteeing more Americans access to health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "We deeply appreciate the president's commitment to expanding
primary care services," says Hawkins, "but it should not be seen as a
substitute for insurance coverage."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's answer is a proposal to spend $90 billion on tax credits
over the next decade to help the uninsured buy coverage. But at best
that's another Band-Aid. The tax credit is so much smaller than the
cost of health insurance in most cities that most uninsured still
probably couldn't afford a policy. It's going to take much bolder
thinking -- and a lot more money -- to shorten the line of the
uninsured anxiously assembling every morning in Roland Palencia's
waiting room.</TE>

<HD>Priest Found Dead in Fire at Rectory Was Fatally Shot</HD>

<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>A Roman Catholic priest found dead in his church's rectory after a
fire had been shot to death, authorities said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Father William Gulas, 69, pastor of St. Stanislaus Church, died of
a single gunshot wound to the chest Saturday, the county coroner
said. His death was ruled a homicide. Police said they are
investigating a motive.</LD>
<LD>   "Father Gulas was very well liked in the community and he had a
number of friends, so this is really a mystery," a spokeswoman for
Mayor Jane Campbell said.</LD>
<TE>   A preliminary investigation shows Gulas had been shot and suffered
a blow to the top of his head before the fire was set, the Cuyahoga
County coroner said. Fire officials said the cause of the fire had
not been determined; the arson unit was investigating.</TE>
<TE>   Gulas was found in a first-floor office in the rectory. Two others
escaped.</TE>
<TE>   Gulas came to St. Stanislaus in 1993 and led a campaign to
renovate the 129-year-old church in the city's Slavic Village
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what a tremendous personal loss this is for this parish,"
Bishop Anthony Pilla said during a Saturday night Mass for Gulas at
St. Stanislaus. "We're just going to miss a good, holy priest in our
midst."</TE>

<HD>Parking, Screening Changes Due at Airports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Beginning today, the federal government will open parking lots at the
country's biggest airports that have been off-limits since Sept. 11
because of worries about car bombs.</LD>
<LD>   Officials also will change the way air travelers are screened
after they pass through security checkpoints over the next few weeks,
checking them only at randomly selected gates, Transportation
Security Administration spokesman Robert Johnson said.</LD>
<LD>   "We're trying to avoid screening Grandma two or three times as she
makes her way home for the holidays," Johnson said.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson said the prohibition on unattended vehicles parking within
300 feet of a terminal will be dropped today as long as the terrorist
threat level is at code yellow, or "elevated," the middle of a
five-point scale of risk developed after the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation agency chief James Loy was scheduled to announce
the change at an airport security conference co-sponsored by the
Airports Council International-North America and the American Assn.
of Airport Executives.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called 300-foot rule will be reimposed if the threat level
rises to orange or red, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Airports, though, will have to draw up plans outlining how they
would deal with the threat of an explosion. They won't have to close
the parking areas during an elevated threat if their plans don't call
for that, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   New layers of security allow the rules to be eased, Johnson said,
listing a better-trained screener work force, federal air marshals,
background checks of people who work beyond airport security
checkpoints and screening of checked baggage at 252 airports.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Hauptli, an airport lobbyist, said the airports have pushed
the TSA hard to let them reopen their close-in parking lots. "This
has been a thorn in the side of many airports," Hauptli said, and the
rule brought no significant improvement in security.</TE>
<TE>   Like the parking restrictions, screening passengers just before
they board their plane was on a "stupid rule" list that Loy drew up.
He promised to look at the list and try more common-sense approaches.</TE>

<HD>Democrats Prove a Point in South</HD>
<DH>They end disappointing election season with a Senate win in
Louisiana, showing Bush's soaring popularity in the region isn't
insurmountable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Not dead yet.</LD>
<LD>   That was the defiant cry of Southern Democrats on Sunday after
Sen. Mary Landrieu fought off a ferocious challenge, aided by
President Bush, in Saturday's runoff election in Louisiana.</LD>
<LD>   Landrieu's solid 52%-48% victory over Republican Suzanne Haik
Terrell -- whose campaign was bolstered by recent visits by the
president, Vice President Dick Cheney and other GOP heavyweights --
showed that even with Bush's popularity in the region soaring,
Democrats still could win with the formula that fueled the party's
Southern revival through the late 1990s: heavy black turnout combined
with a centrist appeal that attracts just enough moderate whites for
a majority.</LD>
<TE>   Landrieu's win, combined with the narrow victory of Democrat
Rodney Alexander in a Republican-leaning Louisiana House district,
provided a surprising coda to an election that had sent Democrats
reeling across the South. The results suggested that while Bush's
popularity is an enormous force, it is not an insurmountable one.</TE>
<TE>   After the Republican Southern gains in November, "Bush wanted this
Louisiana election to be an exclamation point," said Karl Struble, a
Democratic consultant who worked for Landrieu. "Instead, it's a
question mark."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's strength in the South still poses a threat to the region's
Democrats. In 2000, Bush carried all 11 states of the old
Confederacy, as well as Oklahoma and Kentucky. And he continues to
enjoy enormous job approval ratings in the South, which helped spur a
spike in Republican turnout that carried the party to breakthroughs
across the region last month.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Democrats suffered their deepest electoral losses in the
South. Republicans ousted Democratic incumbent governors in Georgia,
Alabama and South Carolina; won control of the state Houses of
Representatives in North Carolina and Texas; captured the state
Senate in Georgia; and convincingly ousted Democratic U.S. Sen. Max
Cleland in Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Just as dramatically, the party easily held four Senate seats left
vacant by the retirement of longtime GOP incumbents. Despite high
hopes for the contests -- in North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas
and Tennessee -- the Democratic nominee didn't win more than 45% of
the vote in any of them.</TE>
<TE>   All this reversed a Democratic mini-revival across the region
through the late '90s that saw the party recapture two U.S. Senate
seats and grab a majority of governorships in the Deep South states.</TE>
<TE>   Although the network exit-polling system collapsed this year, the
available evidence suggested that the problem for Democrats was less
a failure to turn out their core African American supporters than a
crippling erosion among white voters, who are now backing Bush.</TE>
<TE>   In Georgia, for instance, the Republican vote surged in virtually
all-white exurban counties outside Atlanta and rural areas. In Texas,
according to final Republican polls, Tony Sanchez, the Latino
Democratic gubernatorial nominee; Ron Kirk, the Democratic African
American Senate nominee; and John Sharp, the conservative white
Democrat running for lieutenant governor, all failed to attract more
than one-third of the white vote.</TE>
<TE>   In all those victories, Bush's popularity appeared to have been a
critical ingredient.</TE>
<TE>   "George W. Bush becoming the face of our party and changing, in
effect, the social location of our party -- so we are seen as still
conservative but also compassionate, and we are seen as a
pro-education party -- has been critical," says Ralph Reed, the GOP
chairman in Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Landrieu's surprisingly strong victory -- her 40,000-vote
margin was nearly seven times larger than her advantage in 1996, her
first race -- may have shown Democrats a formula for how to cope with
Bush's appeal in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Landrieu benefited not only from a large black turnout in New
Orleans -- which she carried with a resounding 80% of the vote -- but
also a solid performance among whites, especially blue-collar voters.
Her campaign's polling suggests she may have won as many as 38% of
whites -- which combined with African American votes is enough for
Democrats to win in most Southern states.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it shows it is permissible to stand up to the president
strongly, clearly and directly," said Jim Jordan, executive director
of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Or as Landrieu herself put it on "Fox News Sunday": "People
rejected the notion that we need to send a label to Washington. We
need to send leaders to Washington."</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand, Landrieu had touted her support for Bush on many
issues -- particularly the war against terrorism and his tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   But she also had argued that she would oppose him when his
policies hurt the state -- citing administration trade policies on
steel and especially sugar as her principal examples -- and suggested
that Terrell would simply toe the White House line.</TE>
<TE>   "I will support the president when he is correct and ...
advocating on behalf of Louisiana, but I will not be a rubber stamp
for that president or any president," Landrieu had declared at one
point.</TE>
<TE>   That was almost exactly the same formulation Arkansas Atty. Gen.
Mark Pryor used in fashioning the Democrats' one major bright spot in
the South last month: his defeat of Republican Sen. Tim Hutchinson.</TE>
<TE>   The overlap isn't surprising; after Landrieu's failure to win a
majority in the November election forced her into Saturday's runoff
-- she took about 46% of the vote, with Terrell and two other
Republicans splitting just over 50% -- she fired her campaign staff
and hired Struble, the Democratic consultant who shaped Pryor's
message.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not coincidental," said Jordan. "This is putting into
action learned lessons."</TE>
<TE>   For Landrieu, that argument "crystallized" (in Struble's phrase)
in her charge during the campaign's last week that the Bush
administration had reached a secret deal to increase imports of
Mexican sugar -- an unattractive prospect for the state's growers.</TE>
<TE>   Landrieu criticized the administration more sharply on that issue
than almost any Southern Democrat challenged the president on any
front this fall.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in the last week that's what turned it," said Struble.
"We were really building a case about her being independent and Suzie
Terrell being a rubber stamp and ... [the sugar dispute] brought to
life the argument we were making in a personal way."</TE>
<TE>   Mitch Bainwol, executive director of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, said that argument did not have nearly as much
impact as Democrats believe.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he maintains the key to Landrieu's survival was the
Republican success at winning control of the Senate in November. That
undercut Bush's argument that it was imperative for voters to send
him senators who would support his agenda -- which proved to be
perhaps the most powerful Republican weapon this fall in states, like
Louisiana, that Bush carried in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Had this really been a race that would have determined control of
the Senate, our message would have been much easier," Bainwol said.
"Then the race would have been not about what Mary Landrieu has done
for Louisiana or not, but do you want [Massachusetts Democratic Sen.
Edward M.] Kennedy or Bush to drive policy for the nation."</TE>
<TE>   Whether Landrieu truly showed Southern Democrats a way to counter
Bush's appeal probably won't be apparent until 2004. Five Southern
Democratic senators -- Ernest F. Hollings in South Carolina, John
Edwards in North Carolina, Zell Miller in Georgia, John B. Breaux in
Louisiana and Blanche Lambert Lincoln in Arkansas -- will all be on
the ballot that year, as will Bush.</TE>
<TE>   And although Landrieu's victory probably has all five breathing
easier today, they will continue to face the challenge of coexisting
with a popular president from the other party who has shown himself
willing, even eager, to use his prestige in campaigns against them.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as Bush's leadership is strong, he is going to put
pressure on a lot of those Southerners," says Rice University
political scientist Earl Black, co-author of the recent book "The
Rise of Southern Republicans."</TE>

<HD>Guam Asks U.S. Disaster Relief</HD>
<DH>Entire island territory is without electricity and water
after Typhoon Pongsona roars through with wind gusts hitting an
estimated 180 mph.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HAGATNA, Guam</DL>
<LD>A day after Guam was raked by a severe typhoon with wind gusts
estimated at more than 180 mph, the U.S. territory today asked for a
federal disaster declaration.</LD>
<LD>   Although Typhoon Pongsona had moved away from the island, Guam
still was being shaken by winds up to 70 mph.</LD>
<LD>   No deaths were reported, but the entire island was without
electricity, and water and sewer systems aren't expected to be fully
operational for several weeks, Gov. Carl Gutierrez said today. "There
is no doubt that the impact of this latest storm will be
devastating," Gutierrez said in a letter asking President Bush to
declare Guam a federal disaster area.</LD>
<TE>   Pongsona hit Guam on Sunday, covering the island for hours. The
sustained wind speed estimated at 150 mph around the eye of the storm
gave Pongsona "super-typhoon" status. The storm blasted some spots
with gusts up to 184 mph, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Barrigada resident Jackie Cabreras said her brother's house lost
its roof and his mother-in-law's house also lost part of the roof.
"They ran over here during the typhoon," she said. "When they were
running here, the wind was pushing against them. My other brother had
to go out to the porch to pull them in."</TE>
<TE>   A wind speed of 117 mph was clocked before the National Weather
Service's wind sensor failed, along with its radar.</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez said it would take some time to determine the typhoon's
full impact on island infrastructure because of the extent of the
damage and the limited number of engineers available to do surveys.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation is that we have a very severe storm lasting a very
long time," governor's spokesman John Ryan said. "After a storm of
this severity, we are looking at a lot of damage -- a lot of things
loose and to the point where 40-mile winds and 50-mile gusts might
snap something off that normally it would not."</TE>
<TE>   Eight people missing after a fire at a fuel tank farm operated by
Mobil Oil Micronesia were later accounted for, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   By early today, the storm was centered about 100 miles due west of
Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands. Saipan is about 100 miles
northwest of Guam.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Plans to Plug Afghans' Porous Border</HD>
<DH>A checkpoint chain is among projects offered to private
investors. But security concerns are still keeping some contractors
away.</DH>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>To slow the flow of illicit drugs, terrorists and contraband into and
out of Afghanistan, the United States is planning to finance the
construction and maintenance of 177 checkpoints staffed by a
12,000-strong border police unit, officials said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The plan came to light at an investment conference sponsored by
the U.S. Embassy at which officials dangled hundreds of millions of
dollars in prospective supply contracts and construction projects
before a group of local and foreign businesspeople in hopes of
spurring interest in Afghanistan's reconstruction and of boosting the
economy.</LD>
<LD>   Maj. Gen. Karl W. Eikenberry described the construction and supply
of a border checkpoint chain as a "guaranteed market." The general,
who is in charge of the U.S. military's training of a new Afghan
army, did not say how the border police unit would be staffed.</LD>
<TE>   Col. Jesse Munoz of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said the
checkpoints would include offices, sleeping quarters and, in some
cases, clinics, and would cost an average of $300,000. A contract to
build the checkpoints could be awarded as early as April, and they
could be in operation in two to three years, Munoz said.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview later Sunday, Arif Noorzai, Afghanistan's minister
of frontiers and tribal affairs, said he had not been formally
apprised of the U.S. plan. But he applauded a crossing network as
vital to fighting terrorism and protecting the country's economy and
environment.</TE>
<TE>   The checkpoints might also give President Hamid Karzai's
government a way to collect more duties on imports and bolster its
revenue base. Poor customs collection is one of many reasons the
government has had to rely on international donors to finance
four-fifths of its budget.</TE>
<TE>   Smuggling is rife at border crossings, especially along the
heavily traveled frontier with Pakistan. So are exports of illegally
cut Afghan timber, Noorzai said. And the U.S. is concerned about the
free flow of Al Qaeda and Taliban remnants from Pakistan along
Afghanistan's southeastern border, where clashes between those
fighters and U.S. forces have been frequent.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has repeatedly stressed that Afghanistan's recovery and
pacification after decades of strife depend on the involvement of
private investors, both domestic and foreign, in the reconstruction
process. U.S.-funded public works projects represent some of the
prime investment opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "Security and reconstruction go hand in hand," U.S. Ambassador
William B. Taylor, special emissary for donor assistance in
Afghanistan, told those at the meeting Sunday, including two dozen
local businesspeople.</TE>
<TE>   But businesspeople here and officials of various governments say
private investors continue to postpone committing money to
Afghanistan because of security concerns, a lack of technically
trained personnel and delays in the delivery of international aid to
finance infrastructure improvements.</TE>
<TE>   "When we first came here, we were optimistic. But things have
slowed down quite a bit," said Robert Mojave, regional manager of
Dynatek Corp., a Los Angeles-based manufacturer of pumps and
generators.</TE>
<TE>   More hopeful was Shah Aqa Massoud, president of Marammat
Construction of Kabul, who recently returned to this country after
years of exile in the Netherlands.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very optimistic about the future, and we will participate
regardless of the difficulties prevailing in the country now,"
Massoud said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the single biggest business opportunity touted Sunday
involved the U.S. military's training of a new Afghan national army
numbering 70,000 soldiers. Over the next few years, the U.S. plans to
solicit bids worth up to hundreds of millions of dollars to help
house and supply that force. The first portion, a $16.1-million
contract to build a barracks, will be formally awarded next Monday,
Munoz said.</TE>
<TE>   Eikenberry added that the military will soon be in the market for
20,000 pairs of boots and 40,000 uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not talking high-tech material," the general told the
group. "Our strong feeling is that equipment should be provided by
Afghans and [the money] go back into the Afghan economy."</TE>
<TE>   Information on construction and supply contracts for Afghanistan
being solicited by the U.S. government can be found on the Web site
www.export.gov/afghanistan.</TE>

<HD>DNA Found in Bali Linked to Man in Bombing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENPASAR, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>DNA found at the site of the Oct. 12 Bali blasts indicates that the
explosions killed a man who participated in the plot, the chief
investigator said today.</LD>
<LD>   Imam Samudra, the suspected ringleader in the blasts, had told
police that a man named Iqbal detonated a bomb inside his backpack at
Paddy's bar, the first of three near-simultaneous explosions that
killed 191 people. His statement has fed fears that terrorists are
adopting suicide tactics not previously seen in Indonesia, the
world's most populous Muslim nation.</LD>
<LD>   Police said last month that they were collecting DNA from Iqbal's
relatives to see whether it matched DNA found at the site.</LD>
<TE>   "Iqbal has been confirmed as the suicide bomber," said police Gen.
I Made Mangku Pastika, the chief investigator in the blasts. "This
must be a concern for the government since it's a new method."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Pastika's remarks, it remains possible that Iqbal blew
himself up accidentally or that co-conspirators rigged the device to
kill him on purpose.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have blamed the attack on an Al Qaeda-linked group,
Jemaah Islamiah.</TE>

<LD>About 3,000 women, mainly from the former Soviet Union, are sold each
year into Israel's sex industry, which takes in about $1 billion
annually, a parliamentary report said, slamming the country's justice
system for lax punishments.</LD>
<LD>   The women are usually smuggled in by traffickers who promise them
legitimate jobs. Once in Israel, they are sold to pimps for between
$3,000 and $6,000 each, the report said.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli courts generally reach a plea bargain with the pimps and
sentence them to community service, or up to two years in prison,
which the report said is not a deterrent.</LD>

<HD>Church Caught in Ethnic Enmity</HD>
<DH>Rain is ruining a 10th century house of worship in Turkey.
A critic blames neglect on fear of Armenian territorial claims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amberin Zaman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>AKDAMAR ISLAND, Turkey</DL>
<LD>Perched atop this island in Lake Van, the red stone church of Akdamar
is prized by Armenians the world over as one of the finest surviving
monuments of their ancient civilization.</LD>
<LD>   After withstanding more than a millennium of desecration, looting
and war, however, one of the holiest sites of the Armenian Orthodox
Church is facing ruin.</LD>
<LD>   Rainwater seeping through cracks in the dome is washing away
biblical frescoes that adorn the interior. And as dirt and moss build
up inside the cracks and force them open, the dome could collapse at
any time, according to Mete Tozkoparan, an archeologist here in
remote Van province in eastern Turkey.</LD>
<TE>   "We must start restoration work immediately if the church is to be
saved," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As a government official in this predominantly Muslim nation and
director of the state museum in Van, Tozkoparan is not permitted to
comment on why the work hasn't begun, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Huseyin Celik, the minister of culture and a member of the
ruling Islamic-rooted Justice and Development Party, does not mince
words: "What we are up against is an undeclared policy by certain
narrow-minded individuals within the state of discrimination against
Armenian monuments in Turkey."</TE>
<TE>   Victims of that alleged policy include a cathedral in Ani, near
Turkey's border with Armenia. Authorities have rejected funding
offers from Western governments for the structure's restoration,
saying they will carry out the work themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "The fear of these policymakers is that if Christian sites are
restored, this will prove that Armenians once lived here and revive
Armenian claims on our land," Celik said during a recent interview in
Van. Restoring the church on Akdamar, he said, will be a priority for
the new government formed by his party, which won a majority of seats
in parliament during the Nov. 3 election.</TE>
<TE>   Muslim Turks and Christian Armenians remain bitterly divided over
allegations that hundreds of thousands of ethnic Armenians were
massacred in eastern Turkey during and after World War I. Turkey
denies charges of genocide. Its officials insist that Armenians took
up arms alongside invading Russian forces during the war and that
most of the victims died of starvation and exposure while fleeing the
combat.</TE>
<TE>   The "genocide section" at the Van museum features a grotesque
collection of skulls and bones, the remains of people allegedly
slaughtered by Armenians. The display is intended as evidence that
thousands of Turks also perished in the fighting.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, with quiet U.S. encouragement, officials,
journalists and businesspeople from Turkey and Armenia have been
holding low-profile meetings to explore ways to overcome the dispute
and pave the way for diplomatic and trade ties between their
countries.</TE>
<TE>   Progress has been slow. Yet a steady trickle of ethnic Armenians,
including members of the diaspora, has begun to visit Turkey to
rediscover roots and visit holy sites. For many, a highlight is the
20-minute boat ride to Akdamar Island, which lends its name both to
the church and to a fine Armenian cognac.</TE>
<TE>   The name is explained by a popular legend. A nobleman who fell in
love with a princess named Tamar would swim to the island for
nocturnal trysts. One stormy night he drowned in the choppy waters,
uttering a guttural "ach" and her name. Upon news of his death, the
princess died of a broken heart. The island has been called Ach Tamar
-- or Akdamar -- ever since.</TE>
<TE>   The church was built in the 10th century by Armenian King Gagik I
and is said to have once served as the ecumenical seat of the
Armenian patriarch. Built in Armenian style, with a conical dome, the
church is unique on account of the ornate relief work -- a zoo of
birds, snakes and lions intermingled with angels, saints and warriors
-- that decorates its facade.</TE>
<TE>   According to Tozkoparan, shepherds would use the figures for
target practice. In January, visiting museum officials intercepted
looters seeking gold and other treasures falsely rumored to be buried
at the site.</TE>
<TE>   The Van museum is responsible for maintaining the structure but
lacks the funds to do so. Yet when the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce
offered, before the current national government took office, to
finance a $2-million restoration plan, the federal Culture Ministry
turned it down, citing "technical shortcomings."</TE>
<TE>   The real reason was that some of the funds were believed to have
come from Armenian sources, said an archeologist familiar with the
project, who declined to be identified. Undaunted, the Istanbul group
recently submitted a revised plan. The ministry says it will make a
decision by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   Hrant Dink, editor of Agos, a small Armenian-language weekly
published in Istanbul, said Turkish authorities "know very well how
much the restoration of such monuments could boost tourism revenue,
yet their paranoia always seems to be stronger than their common
sense."</TE>
<TE>   "All this nonsense will soon end," pledged Celik, the culture
minister. "If we Turks expect tolerance in the West, then we should
extend the same tolerance at home."</TE>

<DL>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates</DL>
<LD>Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for recent attacks in Kenya that
killed 16 people and vowed even more "lethal" assaults against Israel
and the United States in a statement attributed to the group that
appeared on a militant Web site Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "I hereby confirm what has been issued by Al Qaeda political
office regarding our responsibility for the Mombasa attacks in
Kenya," leading Al Qaeda member Sulaiman abu Ghaith said in an audio
statement on the site.</LD>
<LD>   "The Christian-Jewish alliance will not, God willing, be safe from
attacks by the moujahedeen.... The alliance's installations and
facilities everywhere will be subject to attacks," he said. "The next
phase will witness bigger and more lethal operations."</LD>
<TE>   The Web site has carried statements by Muslim militants, including
Al Qaeda. The pan-Arab satellite TV station Al Jazeera broadcast
parts of the statement and said the voice sounded similar to that on
past Al Qaeda videotapes featuring Abu Ghaith.</TE>
<TE>   In Kenya last month, a hotel bombing killed 10 Kenyans, three
Israelis and three bombers and an Israeli charter jet narrowly missed
being brought down by missiles.</TE>

<DL>GAZA CITY</DL>
<LD>Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian woman and wounded her three
children as well as a second woman in a Gaza Strip refugee camp early
Sunday, Palestinian witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   Nahla Aqel, 40, her 14-year-old daughter and her 4- and 7-year-old
sons were walking home on a road near the border fence separating the
Gaza Strip from Egypt when Israeli troops opened fire from a position
nearby, Palestinian witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   "The woman and her family were walking in the middle of the
street, and I saw her fall, and blood covering her body, and not far
from her, the ... children also fell," said witness Samir abu Shahin.</LD>
<TE>   Aqel died of a bullet wound in the neck, Shahin said. Her
4-year-old son was shot in the head, and her daughter was shot in the
back. Their wounds were considered life-threatening, Shahin said.</TE>
<TE>   The 7-year-old was also wounded moderately, doctors said, but the
nature of his injuries was not clear.</TE>
<TE>   A second woman was shot in the head, Shahin said, but no further
details were available.</TE>
<TE>   Israel said soldiers shot at armed Palestinians trying to
infiltrate a Jewish settlement, Rafiah Yam, and had no information on
civilians being shot.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, two Israeli soldiers were seriously wounded early
Sunday when a bomb went off on the Israeli-Lebanese border. A jeep on
routine patrol along the western part of the border ran over an
explosive device. One of the soldiers lost both his legs, doctors
said.</TE>
<TE>   Two other soldiers were wounded, one lightly and another
moderately, when a bomb exploded next to their jeep near the West
Bank town of Tulkarm, army officials said.</TE>

<HD>President's Struggle Is Part of Battle for Venezuela's
Future</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>One week into a general strike that has rocked this nation, President
Hugo Chavez is again in a fight for his political life.</LD>
<LD>   Eight months ago, Chavez's often chaotic pursuit of a plan to
improve the lives of millions of Venezuela's poor led to a coup that
ousted him for 48 hours.</LD>
<LD>   Then, his foes were relying on the country's military to get rid
of Chavez, but he was restored by loyal troops. Now, his opponents
are relying on the country's second most powerful force: the oil
industry.</LD>
<TE>   Striking oil workers -- from dockworkers to top executives -- have
crippled the state oil company, PDVSA, the nation's most important
business and the third-largest supplier of petroleum to the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   By shutting down key parts of the production chain, PDVSA workers
have managed to freeze oil exports, slash the availability of
gasoline and thrust the country to the point of political crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than fold, however, the combative ex-paratrooper Chavez has
chosen to fight -- in a battle that could profoundly affect the
ongoing struggle over the future of Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to confront them, and we are going to defeat them,"
Chavez said of the striking workers during a five-hour stemwinder
Sunday on his weekly television and radio show. "No matter what
happens, we are going to defeat them."</TE>
<TE>   But it was obvious just how difficult the battle promises to be.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez spent a fourth day in an unsuccessful attempt to replace
the striking crew of a tanker anchored in Lake Maracaibo in
northwestern Venezuela, a ship holding 280,000 barrels of gasoline,
or enough to fill domestic needs for a day.</TE>
<TE>   He threatened during his speech to begin firing disobedient PDVSA
employees, characterizing their work as a "public service." He said
he had the right to take over private gasoline delivery companies and
was also making plans to replace the company's board of directors,
all of whom had offered to resign.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez also sent national guard soldiers to gas stations
throughout Caracas, the capital, as long lines of cars backed up in
search of fuel. Many stations were closed, and those still open were
unsure how much longer supplies would last.</TE>
<TE>   There were some small signs of hope Sunday. A source close to
negotiations between Chavez and his opponents said the two sides had
agreed to formal talks today that would include discussion of an
"electoral packet."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents have sought a nonbinding February referendum on Chavez's
rule, which the president has opposed by insisting that the
constitution would allow only a binding vote in August, halfway
through his term. Now, after three people were killed at a protest
Friday night, the opposition has hardened its demands and wants his
resignation and new elections.</TE>
<TE>   The discussions will include everything from the referendum to a
constitutional amendment that would permit early elections, the
source said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, if the battle over control of the state's oil
production proves difficult, it is also crucial if Chavez is going to
be able to carry out his "Bolivarian revolution," named for the
famous 19th century liberator of South America, Simon Bolivar.</TE>
<TE>   Since he swept into office in December 1998, Chavez has pursued an
almost messianic vision to reshape Venezuela, a country whose oil
riches have not reached most of its 24 million people, 80% of whom
live in poverty.</TE>
<TE>   His overwhelming popularity, after decades of rule by deeply
corrupted traditional political parties, allowed him almost total
control. He created a new constitution, a new assembly and a new
judicial system.</TE>
<TE>   Using special powers granted him by the assembly, he passed a
series of laws last year that raised the ire of powerful sectors
throughout society. One allowed the forced sale of idle land for
redistribution to the poor. A second mandated that the state control
a majority of the shares in new oil exploration.</TE>
<TE>   Like other Latin American reformers, such as Chilean President
Salvador Allende, a socialist who nationalized industries to improve
the lives of the poor, Chavez awoke resentment among the elite, long
used to running Venezuela through political and family alliances.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike Allende, whose overthrow by a CIA-backed coup in 1973
came in the midst of the Cold War, Chavez also has managed to
alienate people from the left and the poor.</TE>
<TE>   The controversial laws -- passed without debate in the
democratically elected assembly -- catalyzed groups normally at odds
to join forces against the maverick president.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's largest business grouping, Fedecamaras, grew
apoplectic over the new laws, which it saw as anti-business. Leaders
of the country's largest labor union, the Confederation of Venezuelan
Workers, grew angry after Chavez launched a long and ultimately
unsuccessful battle to install a close ally as its president.</TE>
<TE>   Military officers and the conservative Roman Catholic Church
became uncomfortable with Chavez's growing flirtation with leftist
ideology, as he improved ties with Cuba and his close friend Fidel
Castro.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela's largest media outlets also turned on Chavez, blaming
his aggressive complaints about their critical editorials and
coverage for a series of attacks by Chavez supporters -- including a
bombing.</TE>
<TE>   And, finally, even many in the middle class turned against Chavez
as oil prices dropped and the economy soured.</TE>
<TE>   Most recent polls show Chavez with about 25% to 30% support --
most of it among the poor, who see in him someone who has at least
shown some interest in improving their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to tell the truth to all Americans: This is the real
Venezuela," said Reimundo Palma, a gay rights activist marching in a
sea of Chavez supporters Saturday. "There are hundreds of thousands
of people supporting our president.... He's going to be here
forever."</TE>

<HD>Wanted Iraqi May Be Al Qaeda Link</HD>
<DH>Abu Wael was Hussein's liaison or an opponent of the
regime, depending on whom you believe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Wright</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SULAYMANIYAH, Iraq</DL>
<LD>A mystery in the U.S.-declared war on terrorism is unfolding in a
warren of mountain caves in northeastern Iraq known as Little Tora
Bora, home to a core group of Al Qaeda fighters and a small army of
local allies.</LD>
<LD>   The mystery is personified by an enigmatic Iraqi based in the
remote mountains who has U.S. intelligence asking: Who exactly is Abu
Wael?</LD>
<LD>   The answer could be pivotal in determining whether Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein really has connections to Osama bin Laden. So far, the
evidence is both intriguing and contradictory.</LD>
<TE>   One body of evidence points to Abu Wael as a senior Iraqi
intelligence officer and as Hussein's secret liaison with Al Qaeda
and its Iraqi affiliate, Ansar al-Islam, or Supporters of Islam. That
would make him the long-sought connection between Iraq and Al Qaeda
-- and justification for tying a U.S.-led military operation in Iraq
to the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But other evidence suggests that Abu Wael is a senior official in
Ansar who deeply opposes Hussein as an autocrat in a secular regime
that has brutally repressed Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   The intelligence behind both claims comes largely from prisoners
held at an unassuming compound of whitewashed buildings that houses
the intelligence headquarters and jail in this bustling Kurdish city
about an hour from Little Tora Bora. In recent months, the Kurds who
run an autonomous statelet in northern Iraq and are allied with the
United States have taken dozens of prisoners who have provided new
pieces of the puzzle for U.S. intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   That puzzle is still far from complete. But some facts are not
disputed: Shortly before the Sept. 11 attacks, a group of Al Qaeda
fighters left Afghanistan, and traveled smugglers' routes through
Iran into northern Iraq's Kurdistan. Their goal was to establish a
backup base for Al Qaeda, according to Al Qaeda members, U.S.
intelligence and Kurdish officials.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Qaeda fighters set up in the town of Al Biyara and nearby
mountain villages where Kurdish militants had begun imposing the
strict Islamic rule used by Afghanistan's ousted Taliban regime.
Ansar was then led by the charismatic Mullah Krekar, who had trained
in the 1990s in Pakistan under Abdullah Azzam, one of Bin Laden's
early mentors. Abu Wael, who spent time in the 1990s in Afghanistan
with Al Qaeda, was one of Krekar's top lieutenants, the sources said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Post-9/11 Tension</TE>
<TE>   Local tensions quickly escalated after Sept. 11. Within two weeks
of the terrorist attacks in the United States, Ansar extremists
attacked security forces of the pro-U.S. Kurdish government here.
More than 20 Kurds were killed, their throats slit and bodies
mutilated. Sporadic and deadly clashes have ensued.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Ansar tried to assassinate Barham Salih, the prime
minister of the eastern sector of Iraqi Kurdistan, and only missed
through a fluke of timing. But five bodyguards were slain. In its
Little Tora Bora redoubt, Ansar also tested primitive chemical
weapons, including a cyanide gas, on farm animals this year, U.S. and
Kurdish officials say.</TE>
<TE>   For the Kurds, the 600 to 700 Ansar fighters and the 35 to 100 Al
Qaeda members are now the most serious threat in Kurdistan, the only
Iraqi region not under Hussein's control -- and the only region that
would welcome U.S. troops to oust him. Fighting broke out again
Wednesday when Ansar guerrillas launched a surprise attack on Kurdish
security forces, reportedly killing dozens.</TE>
<TE>   So what has Abu Wael been doing in Kurdistan? Beyond the basic
facts, stories from several prisoners diverge widely -- and the
mystery deepens. The tales from two men illustrate the intelligence
quandary.</TE>
<TE>   Qassem Hussein Mohammed, 36, is a hulking Iraqi with a neat
mustache who bears a slight resemblance to the Iraqi president. He
claims to be an Iraqi intelligence agent captured by the Kurds in
January en route to find Abu Wael, a colleague of 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   According to Mohammed, Abu Wael was a major in the Iraqi army who
joined Hussein's top intelligence unit after finishing law school. He
eventually became the clandestine link between Hussein's regime and
Al Qaeda, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1995, Abu Wael was instructed by Baghdad to go to Afghanistan
to be the connection between Al Qaeda and Baghdad. He did this five
years, until he came back to Kurdistan in 2000," said Mohammed, who
slowly chain-smoked through a long interview at the intelligence
headquarters here.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed says he knows the details because he was the courier
between Abu Wael and Baghdad -- traveling to both Afghanistan and
Kurdistan.</TE>
<TE>   The Kurds are eager to believe the linkage, which might bring U.S.
intervention. But Hussein and Al Qaeda are odd bedfellows, U.S.
officials and analysts note, in light of the Iraqi leader's political
paranoia about militant Islam, often a threat during his 23-year
rule. He has ruthlessly quashed any Islamic stirrings.</TE>
<TE>   But Mohammed, sentenced by the Kurds to six years in prison for
spying, said the unusual alliance emerged out of a shared hatred for
the United States and, more recently, a desire to uproot their joint
U.S.-backed Kurdish rivals.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam's long-term interests," said Mohammed, "were more
important than the ideology of an Islamic group."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Turning Point</TE>
<TE>   The turning point was the 1991 Persian Gulf War. In 1992, Hussein
hosted Ayman Zawahiri, Bin Laden's top strategist and founder of
Egypt's Islamic Jihad, said Mohammed, who claimed to be in charge of
guarding the delegation. Iraqi intelligence has also occasionally
trained both Ansar and Al Qaeda operatives in explosives, chemical
weapons and suicide missions, he alleged.</TE>
<TE>   If true, this would be the most damning evidence yet uncovered
about Hussein's links to Al Qaeda -- a theory of top Bush
administration officials that came into question after recent denials
by Czech officials that Sept. 11 hijacker Mohamed Atta and Iraqi
intelligence had met in Prague, the Czech capital.</TE>
<TE>   But none of it is true, insisted Qayis Ibrahim Qadir, 27, a wiry
assassin with a long, unkempt beard who said he worked closely with
Abu Wael. Qadir was captured after trying to assassinate Salih, the
Kurdish prime minister, and killing his bodyguards. The only one of
three assassins to survive, he described himself as a "jihadi" and
member of Ansar who also spent time in Yemen and worked with Al Qaeda
in Kurdistan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another Version</TE>
<TE>   "Abu Wael is one of our leaders who spent many years in
Afghanistan and knew Osama bin Laden. He would never work for Saddam,
the worst kind of nonbeliever and a tyrant," Qadir said with vehement
assurance in a separate interview.</TE>
<TE>   "In practical terms, it might be useful to have the support of a
ruler or to play one ruler off against another," he added. "That's
what they want you to believe. But I can promise you -- 1 million
percent I promise you -- that Abu Wael had no ties to Saddam Hussein.
We don't have ties to any rulers."</TE>
<TE>   Ansar's immediate mission is to expand its following and territory
in Kurdistan and later to challenge the secular rule in Baghdad,
Qadir said.</TE>
<TE>   The identity and status of Abu Wael have become all the more
important lately because Mullah Krekar, whose real name is Najm Din
Faraj Ahmad, was stopped in Iran in September and deported to
Amsterdam, where he is still being held. U.S. intelligence believes
Ansar now wants to take Americans hostage to press for a swap.</TE>
<TE>   But the whereabouts of Abu Wael are also in question. Mohammed,
the Iraqi intelligence agent, says he had been dispatched to
Kurdistan because Baghdad had lost contact with the Ansar official
late last year. The last Iraqi intelligence knew, he said, Abu Wael
was going to Afghanistan to meet Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Again, not so, said Qadir, the confessed assassin. Abu Wael was
still working this year around Little Tora Bora.</TE>
<TE>   And so the picture gets fuzzier. Said one senior U.S. official:
"It's one of the bottomless mysteries we face these days. We're not
sure where he is -- or if he's even alive."</TE>

<CX>   Terror link -- An article in Section A on Dec. 9 about an Iraqi who
may offer a link between the Baghdad regime and Al Qaeda said the
leader of an Iraqi group affiliated with the terror network studied
with a mentor of Osama bin Laden in the early 1990s. He studied with
him in the 1980s.</CX>

<HD>Turnout in Serbia Presidential Election Falls Short Once
More</HD>
<DH>Kostunica again is the top vote-getter in the balloting. He
promises to launch a legal appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia</DL>
<LD>For the second time this fall, Serbia failed to elect a president as
too few voters showed up Sunday to cast ballots, exit polls showed.</LD>
<LD>   The state electoral commission said turnout was about 45% of the
6.5 million eligible voters, below the required 50% and slightly less
than when the vote failed in October.</LD>
<LD>   The failed vote heralds a continued period of uncertainty and
power battles among the politicians who ousted Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.</LD>
<TE>   Current Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica, a self-styled
moderate nationalist, was the top vote-getter, winning 58%,
independent observers said.</TE>
<TE>   Vojislav Seselj of the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party got
36%. Borislav Pelevic, an expert kick-boxer and candidate of the
Serbian Unity Party, founded by late Serb warlord Zeljko Raznatovic,
a.k.a. Arkan, had 3.4%, election monitors said.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, Kostunica denounced the 50% turnout requirement and
said the number of eligible voters was "inflated" with dead and
nonexistent people. He said he will appeal to the Serbian
constitutional court and international institutions.</TE>
<TE>   Kostunica also came first in a September election but did not
secure an absolute majority. In October's failed runoff, he outpolled
a candidate backed by his archrival, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran
Djindjic.</TE>
<TE>   Kostunica and Djindjic, who cultivates the image of a pro-Western
economic reformer, were the two leading figures in the alliance that
toppled Milosevic. But they have since been engaged in a power
struggle.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear what would happen if officials declared Sunday's
vote invalid. The constitution has no such provisions.</TE>
<TE>   Kostunica indicated previously that he would seek early
parliamentary elections. His rival would like to see the law changed
to have the president elected by Serbia's parliament.</TE>
<TE>   That would give Djindjic a chance to nominate a candidate of his
choice who would be assured of victory, because Djindjic controls the
legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Many voters stayed home amid widespread apathy, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "What is there to vote for when nothing will change after Sunday?"
asked Radmila Micic, an unemployed economist and mother of two. "I'd
better stay home Sunday and see to lunch."</TE>

<HD>Few to See Full Iraqi Report</HD>
<DH>The U.S. and other permanent Security Council members will
get an unedited version. Details that could aid arms proliferation
are to be excised for the rest.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As Iraq's 12,000-page weapons declaration winged its way toward
United Nations headquarters Sunday, the U.S. government scrambled to
negotiate full access to it while trying to make sure that some other
members of the Security Council received a censored version, U.S. and
U.N. officials said.</LD>
<LD>   By late Sunday, a compromise had been reached that would allow the
five permanent members of the Security Council -- the United States,
Britain, Russia, China and France, all of which have nuclear weapons
-- to receive unedited copies of the declaration, Bush administration
and Security Council officials said.</LD>
<LD>   However, before handing Iraq's report over to the 10 elected
Security Council members, officials will expunge details that they
fear might help other countries make their own nuclear, chemical or
biological weapons and ballistic missiles, sources said.</LD>
<TE>   An Iraqi official said Sunday that the declaration would show that
his country has no weapons of mass destruction, and he demanded that
the United States produce evidence to support its charges to the
contrary. But the official appeared to imply that Iraq had at some
point been close to building a nuclear bomb.</TE>
<TE>   The diplomatic dance over who will be permitted to analyze Iraq's
documentation seemed to foreshadow struggles between the Bush
administration and its uneasy partners on the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   Among the tensions cited by experts Sunday was whether the United
States and Britain can share intelligence that could help inspectors
find evidence to prove whether the documentation is false without
fear that the information would leak and blow the cover of Iraqi
informants or other intelligence sources. Then too, what will happen
if the inspectors fail to produce evidence to support the Bush
administration's claim that Iraq is not in compliance with Security
Council demands? And what if there is no Security Council consensus
on whether Iraq is in "material breach" of the U.N. resolutions
demanding that it disarm?</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, one day ahead of the U.N. deadline, Iraq handed over
a dossier of 11,807 pages, 352 pages of supplements and a stack of
computer disks. A U.N. official carried the material to the island of
Cyprus, the base for the U.N. weapons inspectors, and then on to
Vienna, headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency. An
IAEA senior official, Jacques Baute, was waiting to pick up the 2,100
or so pages of material pertaining to Iraq's nuclear program.</TE>
<TE>   Baute was trailed by a phalanx of television cameras, which filmed
the green suitcase as it was rolled through the Vienna airport. The
footage was broadcast over and over Sunday while experts debated what
the documents might contain.</TE>
<TE>   The nuclear documents will be analyzed in Vienna, while the rest
of Iraq's declaration -- on the status of the country's chemical,
biological and missile programs -- will be scrutinized at U.N.
headquarters in New York, where it arrived Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   But there was confusion about how the most sensitive disclosures,
if any, were to be handled, and by whom.</TE>
<TE>   A U.N. official said the head of the IAEA, Mohammed Baradei, had
come under pressure from a number of Security Council members,
including the United States, who wanted copies of the nuclear
documents. But he resisted making them available because of concerns,
raised by the agency even while the United Nations was debating the
latest resolution, that details of Iraq's nuclear weapons program
could leak and serve as a primer for other nations seeking the atomic
bomb, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course he's under pressure," the official said. "Every day
there's been contact. The last we heard officially was that IAEA
would sanitize the nuclear declaration, which would then go to the
Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know how it is going to come out," the official added.
"There is some confusion about how this decision gets made."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell spent much of
the weekend on the telephone, speaking Saturday with diplomats in
Russia, France and Mexico and Sunday with the foreign minister of
Mauritius about how the sensitive documents would be handled. Still,
as of midday Sunday, a senior administration official said, "it's not
decided yet who will get it when and in what edition."</TE>
<TE>   Later Sunday, however, another Bush administration official and a
Security Council diplomat said an arrangement had been reached to
give the unexpurgated document only to the five permanent members.
This satisfied the administration and the proliferation concerns
raised by the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Hans Blix.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it was unclear how it would be implemented without
infuriating the 10 elected members of the council -- Colombia, Syria,
Cameroon, Guinea, Singapore, Mexico, Norway, Bulgaria, Mauritius and
Ireland. But because Colombia now holds the council's presidency, it
too presumably would receive a copy of the full report, the diplomat
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, former weapons inspector Jonathan Tucker said Sunday,
a sensitive issue has been the identity of the suppliers of dual-use
technologies, which can be employed for either commercial or military
purposes. Companies around the world cooperated with UNSCOM, the
former U.N. inspection team, on the condition that they not be
identified publicly, he said; giving their names and describing their
technologies could be "a road map to other countries interested in
obtaining dual-use technology," he said. The five permanent Security
Council members, however, are presumed to already have access to such
information.</TE>
<TE>   The concerns about security are compounded by the belief that in
the previous rounds of weapons inspections, which ended in 1998,
Russia provided intelligence that helped Baghdad not only anticipate
where the U.N. inspection teams would search but ensure that they
found nothing. Moreover, during negotiations over the Security
Council resolution this fall, a Russian diplomat was spotted handing
a copy of a draft text of the resolution on Iraq, meant for council
deliberations only, to an Iraqi diplomat.</TE>
<TE>   "You certainly can't guarantee that it won't leak out," the
Security Council diplomat said. "The Iraqis could give it to [other
countries], or someone from the IAEA or UNMOVIC [the current
inspection teams] could leak it."</TE>
<TE>   But the diplomat also said the information in the declaration
could prove unenlightening.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't seen it yet," the official said. "The whole thing
could be a bit overblown."</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference in Baghdad on Sunday, Amar Saadi, who
identified himself as a British-educated chemist and one of many
advisors to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, bristled at American
descriptions of the declarations as "a telephone book" designed to
bury the truth in paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   He said the documentation was so massive because the U.N.
resolution required Iraq to identify all dual-use technologies and
facilities. That means Iraq had to list every factory and facility
that could conceivably be used to make nuclear, chemical or
biological weapons, even though they are not being used for such
purposes, Saadi said.</TE>
<TE>   "You will be surprised when you know that the Ministry of Interior
is included because it operates water treatment plants and sewage
treatment plants, and those plants require chlorine and other
chemicals for treatment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other facilities -- such as canneries and breweries, which contain
fermentation equipment; hospitals, which have laboratories;
petrochemical, fertilizer and food-processing plants; and any others
drawing more than 10 megawatts of electricity -- had to be included,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Saadi appeared to confirm Western assessments that Iraq
was close to making an atomic bomb in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the complete documentations, from design to all the other
things," he said. "We haven't reached the final assembly of a bomb
nor tested it.... It's for the IAEA to judge how close we were. If I
tell you we were close, it is subject[ive], maybe promotional."</TE>
<TE>   Saadi said the declaration was "comprehensive and truthful" and
demanded that the Bush administration immediately produce any
evidence it has to the contrary.</TE>
<TE>   But former weapons inspector Richard O. Spertzel told CNN's "Late
Edition" on Sunday that intelligence agencies have to be mindful of
the evidence they disclose, noting that Iraq's position has long been
"Show us everything you have, and I'm sure we can explain it all
away."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and U.N. officials and former weapons inspectors said it
could take weeks to analyze the contents of the declaration. The
documents will be examined for inconsistencies and omissions and
checked against a list of unresolved issues left by the U.N.
inspection team that departed Iraq in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "It's real forensic work," said former chief inspector Richard
Butler. "Inspectors will want to discern from the documents what Iraq
has not said."</TE>
<TE>   Former American weapons inspectors and U.S. officials appeared to
be trying to lower public expectations for the kind of evidence that
might be considered sufficient to determine whether Iraq is cheating.
Inspectors need not catch Iraq red-handed with possession of a banned
weapon in order to demonstrate a pattern of deception or
noncompliance, they stressed.</TE>
<TE>   "The point of inspections is not to find the smoking gun. It might
be just to find the smoke," former inspector David Kay told CNN.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, 35 more U.N. inspectors and some helicopters arrived in
Baghdad to bolster the inspection teams there.</TE>

<HD>Timing Is Key for Ahmanson</HD>
<DH>Project opponents hope to stall a decision on environmental
report until Jan. 6, when a slow-growth supervisor takes office.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As in comedy -- and there's very little of that in the protracted
controversy over Ahmanson Ranch -- timing is everything in this
development's planning process.</LD>
<LD>   Jan. 6 motivates the project's supporters to surge and its
opponents to stall.</LD>
<LD>   Because on that day, Ventura County Supervisor Frank Schillo, who
endorses the $2-billion mini-city, leaves office and critic Linda
Parks is sworn in, perhaps shifting the board's majority in favor of
Ahmanson's foes.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the supervisors will open a public hearing on an
environmental study of the Ahmanson Ranch development, which plans
for an eventual 3,050 homes on grazing land near Calabasas.</TE>
<TE>   Although the report is focused on the builder's plan to protect
the endangered spineflower and red-legged frog on the project land,
the recent discovery of a toxin used in rocket fuel has raised
concerns about the safety of water for the golf course.</TE>
<TE>   The developer, Washington Mutual Bank, would like the supervisors
to vote as soon as possible to certify the environmental report so
construction can begin.</TE>
<TE>   But previous hearings have attracted so many speakers that it is
likely the board will continue to hear testimony Dec. 17. If it still
can't get to a vote before its end-of-year recess Dec. 20, it will
not be able to take up Ahmanson Ranch until January -- after Schillo
has left and Parks has arrived.</TE>
<TE>   And that, opponents think, might force the developer to think
twice about whether to press on, risking a negative vote and further
delay, or consider a deal to sell the land or turn it over to a land
conservancy for huge tax credits.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Steve Bennett, a leading anti-sprawl activist and
project critic, has asked Washington Mutual to agree to extend the
public comment period by nearly four weeks -- until Jan. 28.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the holiday season," Bennett said, explaining his reasoning
for the extension. The leanings of current and future supervisors are
not a factor, he said. "We shouldn't artificially rush or delay these
hearings."</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, the developer wants to press on.</TE>
<TE>   "We see no good reason for any further delays," spokesman Tim
McGarry said. "The process has already been quite lengthy, and we'd
like the board to hear the matter now."</TE>
<TE>   However long the comment period lasts, many people will want to
discuss perchlorate contamination.</TE>
<TE>   The chemical, which has been linked to thyroid problems, has been
detected near Ahmanson Ranch and in water wells in Simi Valley.
Scientists are unsure whether it migrated from Rocketdyne's Santa
Susana Field Laboratory or came from firecrackers, fertilizer, road
flares or some other source. No study has linked the perchlorate
discoveries to Rocketdyne.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental activists, including Ahmanson Ranch opponents, have
seized on the discovery of perchlorate as a reason to study the
development further.</TE>
<TE>   Schillo said he does not think the chemical threatens public
health. The area's tap water comes mostly from Northern California,
not the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's a serious problem, then everybody ought to move out of
Simi Valley, because there's a lot of perchlorate in Simi Valley,"
Schillo said. The chemical isn't relevant to the upcoming Ahmanson
hearings, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can talk about anything you want," but the environmental
study up for review is about "frogs and flowers," he said. "It has
nothing to do with traffic, perchlorate or anything else."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor John K. Flynn, the board's chairman, said he is willing
to listen to new information.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in public hearings before, and a good logical argument
has been presented that has caught my attention. That could happen
here," he said. "My mind is wide-open."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors Judy Mikels, a supporter of the Ahmanson Ranch
project, and Kathy Long, whom Ahmanson opponents have identified as a
potential swing vote, could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said she will be in the audience, to prepare in case the
vote is called after she takes office.</TE>
<TE>   The Ahmanson Ranch project, first approved in 1992 by Ventura
County supervisors, is on the Los Angeles County line, overlooking
the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   It would include about 8,000 residents, a town center with 400,000
square feet of office and retail space, and a championship golf
course and hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The project survived more than a dozen legal challenges and was
ready to break ground until scientists working for the developer
discovered rare frogs and flowers on the development site.</TE>
<TE>   Now, three years later, a potent group of opponents, including
Hollywood celebrities headed by director Rob Reiner, has joined
leading Valley politicians and environmental organizations in a
campaign to buy and preserve the ranch as parkland.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the project argue that it would fill a dire need for
more housing, and that developers should not now be penalized for a
change in the political climate since the project was approved 10
years ago.</TE>

<HD>Cuts Target Ill and Aging</HD>
<DH>The governor seeks to slash $2 billion from health-care and
welfare programs. Support for nursing homes would be hard hit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Morain</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>As part of the budget-reduction package that he has proposed to close
a huge shortfall this year, Gov. Gray Davis is urging lawmakers to
cut an array of services to the elderly and ill, such as cutting back
on syringes for diabetics and reducing payments to nursing homes that
care for 200,000 aging and infirm Californians.</LD>
<LD>   Educators were among the first to complain about Davis' budget
proposals, which include $3.1 billion in cuts to public school
spending. But the Democratic governor also proposed $2 billion in
cuts to welfare and health-care programs primarily for the poor.
Health and human services spending cuts amount to his second-biggest
target.</LD>
<LD>   Lawmakers face stark choices when they arrive in Sacramento today
to begin vetting Davis' overall proposal to start filling the state's
$21-billion-plus budget gap by a combination of cuts and other
adjustments that amount to $10.2 billion. Those represent the first
move toward closing the budget deficit, which includes the estimated
shortfall in this year's budget as well as the projections for an
even bigger problem for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1.</LD>
<TE>   Under Davis' plan, the University of California would lose $74
million and the California State University system would be cut $60
million. Transportation projects would be shelved, school districts
would lose billions of dollars and state workers could face layoffs.
Virtually every state department is facing reductions.</TE>
<TE>   In health care, among Davis' proposals are recommendations to
eliminate payments for dental care and to stop paying for medical
supplies such as rubber sheets for poor people. Many experts said
infirm people need such supplies to remain in their homes and avoid
going to nursing homes. Davis also urges a 10% cut in payments to
nursing homes, after having embarked on a push two years ago to
improve nursing-home care.</TE>
<TE>   Davis wants the Legislature to act by the end of January. Once
serious hearings begin, most likely next week, Davis' fellow
Democrats will mount the strongest opposition to overall health and
welfare cuts. But Republicans are likely to oppose some specific cuts
-- and nursing home care is one.</TE>
<TE>   "Historically, nursing homes have been grossly underfunded," said
Sen. Dick Ackerman (R-Irvine), a budget committee member who like all
but seven legislators voted for the nursing-home overhaul two years
ago. "They don't have enough nurses. They don't have trained
employees. People in nursing homes need that care."</TE>
<TE>   Several Democrats have said that they won't consider cuts until a
consensus emerges on tax hikes. Like Republican legislators, Davis is
refusing to embrace tax hikes at least for now, instead focusing on
cuts. Even so, the cuts Davis proposed Friday would fill less than
half the budget hole.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like we're being asked to do the heavy lifting," said
Sen. Don Perata (D-Alameda). Davis administration officials
acknowledged that the cuts in nursing home payments and health
services are tough ones.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no good choices," Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio
said Sunday. "It is obviously the last resort."</TE>
<TE>   Although the proposed cuts to programs that serve the aging and
sick are large, their precise impact is hard to gauge at this stage.
Finance Director Tim Gage and Diana Bonta, director of the Department
of Health Services, which regulates nursing homes, seemed uncertain
Friday about the implications of a 10% cut in payments to nursing
homes. Neither could say how much a 10% cut would save the state.</TE>
<TE>   Bonta could not say whether nursing homes would accept fewer
indigent patients if payments are reduced by 10%. And Gage could not
say specifically how many people would lose health-care benefits if
Davis' proposals are enacted, other than to place the number at more
than 200,000.</TE>
<TE>   At an annual cost of $9.8 billion, the Medi-Cal program pays the
health-care costs of 6.4 million indigent elderly and disabled people
each month. Davis proposes to trim $167 million from Medi-Cal
starting in the third quarter of the 2002-03 fiscal year. If spread
over a full year, that could translate to nearly 7% of the total
spent on Medi-Cal.</TE>
<TE>   Davis Proposals</TE>
<TE>   Davis is urging that:</TE>
<TE>   * Income rules be changed. A family of four earning $18,000 a year
is eligible for Medi-Cal now. Davis would lower that to $12,000,
saving about $6.2 million in the fourth quarter and $118 million next
year.</TE>
<TE>   * Aid recipients be required to fill out eligibility forms once
every three months, rather than once a year. The administration
expects that recipients would fail to fill out the extra paperwork,
and fall from the rolls. That would save $5 million for the remainder
of the current year, and $85 million in the coming fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   * The state end payments for many so-called optional Medi-Cal
benefits, saving $63.3 million in the final quarter of the fiscal
year. One such benefit is dental care, costing $48 million a year.
Medical supplies, such as syringes and test strips for diabetics,
catheters and rubber sheets, also are considered optional.</TE>
<TE>   * The state enact a 10% cut in Medi-Cal payments to physicians and
others who provide care for elderly and disabled poor people, saving
the state $90 million in the fourth quarter. The category includes
payments to nursing homes.</TE>
<TE>   The recommended cuts in those areas represent a departure for
Davis. As part of his "aging with dignity initiative," the governor
in his first term increased state oversight of nursing homes, boosted
payments to the facilities by 10%, and ordered pay raises and
improved training for nursing home workers. At the time, nursing
homes were receiving a flat $88 per patient per day.</TE>
<TE>   The steps came in response to a 1998 federal report finding that
problems in 30% of the state's homes resulted in death or serious
injury to residents. Many of the same problems were identified by a
state watchdog agency in the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   With small rate hikes granted earlier this year, nursing homes
receive daily Medi-Cal payments ranging from $131.08 per patient in
the Bay Area to $103.54 in Los Angeles. A 10% cut would lower
payments to Los Angeles-area homes almost to the old levels.</TE>
<TE>   "Where do you make that up?" Pat McGinnis, executive director of
the California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform in San Francisco,
asked, referring to a 10% cut in government payments. "You make it up
by increasing the private payment rates ... and by not taking as many
Medi-Cal patients."</TE>
<TE>   Patients often begin their nursing home stays by paying from their
own pockets. But with homes costing about $5,000 a month, savings
accounts become depleted, McGinnis said. Government payments account
for some or all of the nursing home costs for 64% of the about
200,000 Californians a year who enter such facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The California Assn. of Health Facilities, the main nursing home
lobby organization, estimates that 160, or nearly 10% of the state's
nursing homes, are in bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Warning that more homes would become insolvent, Betsy Hite,
spokeswoman for the group, said a 10% cut would average $13 per
patient per day. Although the cut would save the state about $175
million over a full year, Hite said the federal government matches
state payments to nursing homes. So a $175-million cut in state
payments would result in a matching cut of $175 million from the
federal government.</TE>
<TE>   Health-care workers also would feel the impact of such cuts, their
advocates said.</TE>
<TE>   Nursing home workers earn as little as $8 or $9 an hour in the Los
Angeles area, and simply cannot withstand a pay cut, said lobbyist
Beth Capell, who specializes in health-care issues for clients such
as the Service Employees International Union, which represents
nursing home workers.</TE>
<TE>   "A 10% cut is astonishing," Capell said. "It will mean real wage
cuts."</TE>
<TE>   Tax Hike Interest</TE>
<TE>   Some Davis allies seem frustrated that the governor won't reveal
what, if any, tax hikes he might support, as he proposes his array of
cuts. Others wonder if Davis, by suggesting that the state stop
paying for such basics as rubber sheets or syringes, is trying to
underscore the depth of the state's budget situation -- and soften up
opposition to tax hikes later.</TE>
<TE>   In either case, some Democrats warn that they are wary of backing
the governor in this area.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a direct hit on seniors and the most vulnerable
population," Perata said.</TE>
<TE>   "As a Democrat, I'm not in office to further exacerbate hardship
on vulnerable people," he said.</TE>

<HD>A Local Viewpoint for Federal Task Force</HD>
<DH>Sheriff Carona, on the homeland security panel, stresses
action at the community level.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mai Tran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sheriff Michael S. Carona, who was appointed last week to advise
President Bush's Homeland Security Task Force, said he intends to
push for strong coordination between the federal and local fight
against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Carona, one of 14 officials across the nation selected to be
advisors, said his experience in local law enforcement will give
homeland security leaders in Washington a good perspective on how
their policies are felt at the community level.</LD>
<LD>   One of his top goals, he said, is to persuade the federal
government to provide additional training to police and emergency
services personnel so they can develop preventive programs as well as
deal with acts of terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   He said he wants to see a national strategy that can be
implemented at the local level.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's so far out there, others can't use it either," said
Carona, who attended his first meeting in Washington last week.</TE>
<TE>   For example, he said, the county has a new 800-megahertz radio
communications system, but it doesn't connect with officials in other
parts of the country and would not be useful during a nationwide
emergency.</TE>
<TE>   Carona said that, for a plan to work on a national scope, the
federal government would have to share resources, including access to
public health response teams in case of biological or chemical
emergency.</TE>
<TE>   "The beauty of the advisory council is to examine the best
practices across America and recommend the best ones," Carona said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he opposes use of funding from local law enforcement and
fire agencies to fight terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't take a cop off the street to fight terrorism," Carona
said. "This should be done with new dollars, not at the expense of
programs that have been developed and work."</TE>
<TE>   He also said he wants the money invested in homeland security
distributed evenly.</TE>

<HD>Dean Felled by Scandal Had 2 Faces</HD>
<DH>Many at Boalt Hall call John Dwyer a top educator. Others
say he had a weakness for seducing students.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maura Dolan, Rebecca Trounson and Carol Pogash</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The boy who began life in a Midwest trailer park worked his way as a
young man into the chambers of the U.S. Supreme Court, where he
clerked for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.</LD>
<LD>   Though at times restrained and even shy, he rose to the top job at
one of the nation's leading law schools, displaying a charm in public
that sometimes dazzled donors, alumni and colleagues. He became a
mentor and friend to students at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of
Law; they lined up outside his office to see him.</LD>
<LD>   And then John P. Dwyer risked it all.</LD>
<TE>   These days, according to friends, he sits alone in his cliff-side
condominium in North Beach, reading supportive e-mail and simmering
over a sexual harassment charge that forced him, on the eve of
Thanksgiving, to resign as Boalt Hall's dean.</TE>
<TE>   The intensely private Dwyer opens his morning paper to read
detailed accounts of how he allegedly fondled and undressed a law
student while she was passed out drunk. His mood, friends say, ranges
from sadness to fury. In a terse statement on the day he resigned, he
admitted only to a single consensual -- albeit inappropriate --
sexual encounter with a student that did not involve intercourse. He
has not spoken publicly since.</TE>
<TE>   Boalt Hall was Dwyer's world. Now 51, he received his law degree
there and taught in its classrooms for 18 years, the last two as
dean. "It was everything to him, his family, his life," said June
Beltran, his third wife. Beltran, who is more than 10 years younger
than Dwyer, began dating him when she was a third-year law student.
They are now divorced.</TE>
<TE>   Tall and attractive, the dean worked hard. The lights in his
office often burned till midnight. He had a knack for raising money
-- crucial at a public school that hopes to compete with private
institutions like Stanford and Harvard, which have large endowments.</TE>
<TE>   Dwyer was "so powerfully smart and so remarkably dedicated to this
institution that even though he's not a particularly outgoing or
social person, he grew to embrace the idea of fund-raising with the
greatest possible commitment," said Louise Epstein, Boalt's assistant
dean for alumni relations and development. Many students said they
felt he truly cared for them. He was always accessible, at times
holding office hours in the school cafe.</TE>
<TE>   But there was another side to him: He had a reputation for dating
female students far younger and less powerful than he.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Dwyer, his younger brother, said in an interview Sunday that
when he learned John had to resign as dean, "My first reaction to
that was I bet it is sexual harassment." John would boast about
having sex with students, said Andy Dwyer, a sex discrimination
lawyer in New Jersey who has been estranged from his brother for more
than 10 years. "He was really proud of the fact that he could seduce
women."</TE>
<TE>   'Bill Clinton of Boalt'</TE>
<TE>   Even after Dwyer became dean in 2000, students joked about his
alleged flirtations and dalliances. He was dubbed by some the "Bill
Clinton of Boalt Hall."</TE>
<TE>   One source at the law school who declined to be identified said
that "a lot of women are attracted to him, and he loves it -- people
idolize him, and he feeds off that." But the source never heard
anyone Dwyer has dated complain about him.</TE>
<TE>   Monique Morales, 31, who took a class from Dwyer, said she is
troubled by what she has read of the complaint against him, but she
never saw any hint of impropriety. She attended a student party at
his home, and the students afterward cajoled him into going dancing
with them, she said.</TE>
<TE>   University policy prohibits dating that raises a "conflict of
interest" -- which officials say bars professors from dating students
currently in their classes. UC Berkeley officials, without discussing
Dwyer's case, say that deans are not supposed to date students in
their school.</TE>
<TE>   But the allegations against Dwyer go beyond simple dating; the
young woman who lodged the complaint against him in October alleges
he sexually assaulted her. According to the alleged victim's lawyer,
the woman had been drinking with friends from the law school in
December 2000. She ran into Dwyer, who offered to drive her home. He
came inside to use the bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney, Laura Stevens, said her client passed out on her
bed, and when she awoke in the middle of the night, she found Dwyer,
fully clothed, with his head resting on her chest, intimately
touching her. She had been partially undressed.</TE>
<TE>   Just 'Flirtatious'</TE>
<TE>   Beltran is skeptical. "Perhaps he is flirtatious, but he is not a
criminal," she said. "I would host parties for his students all the
time. He had these young, beautiful law students falling all over
him. He was warm, charming and witty. But that is different from
sexual assault."</TE>
<TE>   Dwyer's marriage to Beltran ended in divorce when "he fell in love
with someone else," Beltran said softly. She said she did not know
whether his new interest at the time was a student. Beltran referred
to herself as Dwyer's second wife, and his colleagues at Boalt also
said she was his second wife, but she was actually his third. His
brother Andy said that John's first marriage was to a Kentucky women
he met in college. Asked about this Sunday, Beltran said John had
implored her to keep his short first marriage a secret. The second
wife declined to be interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   Students and faculty say Dwyer moved in a law school culture where
faculty are expected to socialize with students, to invite small
groups to their homes and to attend law school functions where heavy
drinking is often the norm.</TE>
<TE>   "He was caught halfway between generations," said an adjunct
professor at Boalt who asked not to be identified by name. "Ten, 20
years ago, professors thought [sleeping with female law students] was
one of the perks of the job.</TE>
<TE>   "But then the revolution came.... He is young enough to know
better, to know the rules, but the temptation is just so great."</TE>
<TE>   Dwyer is a baby boomer, born in the Midwest in 1951. Close friends
said he had an unhappy childhood. The eldest of four children, Dwyer
grew up in Grand Rapids, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Dwyer said their parents came from impoverished backgrounds
-- their maternal grandfather was a coal miner. When John was an
infant, he and his parents lived for a short time in a mobile home.
But the family prospered. Their father eventually became a corporate
executive, and the family had a comfortable, upper-middle class
lifestyle, Andy Dwyer said. Beltran said John Dwyer had ugly memories
of his early years, and his brother does not dispute that this might
be the case. Andy Dwyer said their mother was a disciplinarian.</TE>
<TE>   During their seven years of marriage, Beltran never met a single
member of his family, she said. When his father died, his brothers
called him, and his sister e-mailed him. "He didn't even call us
back," Andy Dwyer said. He said he stopped talking to John when John
refused to have contact with their other siblings.</TE>
<TE>   Dwyer went to DePauw University in Indiana as a rector scholar, an
honor given to students who have shown "extraordinary academic
achievement," and majored in chemistry and math. He won a National
Science Foundation Fellowship, an academic coup, and went to graduate
school at the prestigious California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   After one year at Caltech, Dwyer told his advisor, Aron
Kuppermann, that he wanted to pursue law instead of science because
law would give him more contact with people and be socially useful.</TE>
<TE>   Kuppermann talked Dwyer into earning his PhD in chemical physics
anyway -- which he did in four years, rather than the usual five. On
his thesis, he thanked Kuppermann and even acknowledged his parents.</TE>
<TE>   Dwyer excelled in law just as he had in science. He graduated at
the top of his class, and managed to publish scientific papers while
at Boalt. After clerking for O'Connor and U.S. Court of Appeals
Justice Harry E. Edwards, Dwyer could have pursued a lucrative career
in a pedigreed law firm. Instead, he joined the public defender's
office in Washington, D.C., a prestigious post.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Feldman, a major donor to Boalt, remembers Dwyer being asked
once how he could have defended bad people. According to Feldman,
Dwyer said: "They're not bad people.... They are ordinary people in
terrible trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Feldman recalled the words last week, echoing them as he described
Dwyer's predicament: It's "a case of a good person doing a bad
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Dwyer returned to Boalt Hall in 1984 as a law professor. Again he
soared, winning a teaching award in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Marchegiani, 25, who took a "properties" class from Dwyer two
years ago, said Dwyer was the best teacher he had at Boalt. "He had a
gift for making you stay interested," Marchegiani said.</TE>
<TE>   Dwyer alienated some faculty members with his acerbic edge. But
when he was promoted to replace Dean Herma Hill Kaye two years ago,
Dwyer tempered his blunt manner. He worked to make the faculty and
student body more diverse, courted alumni donors and raised large
amounts of money for the school.</TE>
<TE>   Kate Gordon, an Oakland lawyer who is a friend, said running the
school eventually began to gnaw at him emotionally.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was kind of killing him," she said. "Every decision
that went wrong really affected him. He really loved that school."</TE>
<TE>   In his final speech to alumni, six days before his resignation, he
gave no hint of the pressures that engulfed him. Epstein, the
assistant dean for alumni relations, recalled him as "dazzling," even
"with the sword of Damocles hanging over him."</TE>
<TE>   Now, at his condominium off a path with no street sign, the buzzer
to his condo is always busy. He does not answer his telephone. A
friend said he feels besieged.</TE>
<TE>   "Teaching is the thing he loved most in the world -- I don't think
there is any question about that," said his friend Gordon. "And I
don't think he is going to get to teach again."</TE>

<HD>Friends Lament Slaying, Violence</HD>
<DH>Would-be robbers kill a South L.A. man loved by a community
that has mourned many others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Gottlieb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was a protest last month against the violence in this South Los
Angeles neighborhood, where the streets so often are ruled by gangs,
drugs and prostitution, where jobs are scarce and where small
businesses struggle for air.</LD>
<LD>   Marchers led by Msgr. David O'Connell walked the mile down South
Figueroa Street between Imperial Highway and Century Boulevard,
stopping at each spot where someone had been killed in the last year.
They stopped eight times.</LD>
<LD>   Another body was added to the toll over the weekend, a man
familiar to those who attend Ascension Catholic Church, which is
O'Connell's parish. Celso Mazariegos, who owned the flower shop
across the street and the hair salon down the block, was slain
Saturday night.</LD>
<TE>   Police said two men came into the tiny flower shop at the corner
of South Figueroa and 112th Street at 6:15 p.m. and tried to rob it.
Mazariegos, 50, started to run, police said, but one of the gunmen
shot him just outside the front door. His 13-year-old son, who often
played on the street near his parents, watched him die, friends said.
Police did not know if anything was taken.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the whole community cried over the loss of that man,"
said a 39-year-old homeless man named Ike. "I didn't know anybody who
had contact with him that didn't like him."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the flower shop Sunday, votive candles were arranged in
the shape of a cross near where Mazariegos' body fell. The flower
shop, Floreria Janet, was open. It is small enough that two customers
make a crowd.</TE>
<TE>   A glass display case was filled with white teddy bears, and flower
arrangements sat on a counter. A pair of Christmas trees sat outside
the doorway.</TE>
<TE>   Customers came in to place orders, not knowing what had occurred,
while others milled about, wondering how this could happen.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a good man," said Jafet Chavez, 20. "He didn't cause
trouble with nobody. It's a tragedy how they killed him."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone in the neighborhood seems to have their own story about
the violence. "It's not safe anymore," Sandra Thomas, 58, said to her
granddaughter as they entered a Mexican restaurant/mini-market. She
said her 32-year-old son was robbed at gunpoint a couple of years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Rocia Magdalena, 17, said the restaurant had been robbed three
times in the three years her family has owned it.</TE>
<TE>   Mazariegos lived the American story of the immigrant who arrives
with nothing and works hard to build a life for his family. He came
from the southern Mexico state of Chiapas about 20 years ago. Working
as a gardener, he saved his money and opened his own gardening
business, eventually building it to 25 customers. He saved more,
friends said, and opened the beauty salon, which his wife ran, and
the flower shop across the street.</TE>
<TE>   He hired people to run the flower shop during the day, but after
finishing his gardening work, he'd take over until closing time at
7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   He still had time to help coach his son's soccer team and bought
the squad their uniforms. He also had a 14-year-old daughter and
three grown children in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a good father, a good husband," O'Connell said.</TE>

<HD>A Little R&amp;R in Maui Precedes the Budget Battle</HD>
<DH>Between golf, snorkeling and relaxing in the sun, several
lawmakers attend a conference sponsored by the prison guard union.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Vogel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAHAINA, Hawaii</DL>
<LD>At 7 a.m. Saturday, California Sen. Richard Alarcon, a Democrat from
Sylmar, ordered a coffee to go from the terrace restaurant at the
Sheraton Hotel here. A warm breeze from the beach crossed the
resort's palm grove and koi pond and whispered across the veranda,
launching another lovely December day in Hawaii.</LD>
<LD>   Today, Alarcon will be back in Sacramento to confront an ugly
task: cutting government services and possibly raising taxes to close
a projected revenue gap bigger than the entire budgets of many
states.</LD>
<LD>   But over the weekend, he was hundreds of miles away -- in Maui,
snorkeling, working out at the hotel fitness center and playing golf
at taxpayers' expense.</LD>
<TE>   Like nearly a dozen fellow lawmakers, Alarcon flew to Maui on
Wednesday to attend a conference sponsored by the California
Correctional Peace Officers Assn., the 26,000-member union of prison
guards. The conference involved three morning panel discussions on
Thursday and Friday -- one of which Alarcon skipped -- leaving
lawmakers ample time for play before their departure Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Attendees included three out of four of California's legislative
leaders, and the wives of many of the lawmakers. Most of the
politicians promised to pay for the Maui trip with their own money or
campaign accounts, which in some cases include thousands of dollars
in donations from the prison guards.</TE>
<TE>   But Alarcon said he would have the Senate -- California taxpayers,
in other words -- foot the bill for his $450 flight. The rest of the
costs, including his $300-a-night room at the swank Sheraton, would
partly be covered with the tax-free $125 senators receive each
working day for living expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't be here if I didn't think there was a benefit in
coming here," said Alarcon, looking island casual in khaki shorts and
a T-shirt. "Relationship-building is critical in this business."</TE>
<TE>   But what some lawmakers call "relationship building," others call
special access that might translate into extra clout for prison
guards when budget negotiations get underway in earnest. Advocates
for the poor and schools, for instance, were working last week to
protect their share of a shrinking state budget. But only the prison
guard representatives, whose members recently received a sizable pay
hike from the state government, hobnobbed with leaders of the
Legislature on the sands of Maui.</TE>
<TE>   Those attending the two-day conference -- union leaders, lawmakers
and a few lobbyists -- said no special favoritism would result from
the get-together, which featured seminars on state issues as well as
free time for golf and other recreation. Instead, they described it
as a forum that allows them to talk more openly and honestly than the
partisan posturing of the Capitol usually permits.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like when we're in Sacramento," Sen. Liz Figueroa
(D-Fremont) insisted from her hotel suite overlooking world-famous
Ka'anapali Beach. "We can sit down and have candid discussions about
the budget."</TE>
<TE>   The senator said she is paying "every penny" of the Maui excursion
from her own pocket. She certainly isn't hiding it from voters. While
other lawmakers snorkeled, golfed or shopped, Figueroa spent Saturday
morning in her hotel room, signing two boxes of Christmas cards for
constituents. The cards, purchased at the hotel gift shop, feature
the Hawaiian Christmas greeting -- "Mele Kalikimaka."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Watchdogs Offended</TE>
<TE>   Government watchdogs say there is much to find offensive in the
Hawaii trip.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the major social programs in the state are going to be on
the chopping block," said Paul Ryan, a project director at the
nonprofit Center for Governmental Studies in Los Angeles. Groups that
lack the resources to host appealing fetes for legislators, he
argued, wield less clout and are more vulnerable to severe cuts to
their programs.</TE>
<TE>   Such coziness -- and the perception of the influence it creates --
also make voters cynical, Ryan argued. "When we have voters who feel
that their votes matter far less than campaign contributions being
given, such as from CCPOA," he said, "that's a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last few decades, the prison guards association has
gradually become a Capitol heavyweight with few peers. The union,
known for its strategic support of Democrats and Republicans, helped
to elect Davis in 1998 by contributing $2.1 million to his campaign.
Since then, the union has given Davis an additional $1.46 million in
direct and indirect donations.</TE>
<TE>   Announcing his $10-billion budget-cutting package Friday, Davis
said no area of government would be spared. The Department of
Corrections, however, fared better than most. Under Davis' proposals,
the agency would lose $13.56 million from its overall budget of about
$5 billion. By comparison, Davis proposes $74.3 million in midyear
cuts, from an overall budget of $4.48 billion, to the University of
California, and nearly $60 million, from a budget of $3.45 billion,
in reductions for the state university system. This year the guards
union won pay raises of 37%, spread over five years, from the Davis
administration, a package that will cost more than $500 million
annually when fully implemented. Only one legislator, state Sen. Tom
McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), voted against the raises.</TE>
<TE>   In the debate over how to close California's budget gap, Davis has
suggested reopening some employee contracts, though the prison guards
have not been singled out.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the criticism that has dogged their trip, lawmakers who
made the trek to Hawaii offered no apologies. Among them was Assembly
Minority Leader Dave Cox (R-Fair Oaks).</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a "Lahaina Yacht Club" T-shirt and navy blue shorts, Cox
said his trip, and that of his wife, would be covered by campaign and
personal funds. He also said he spent "an appreciable amount of time"
during the week with Mike Jimenez, the prison guard union president,
discussing ways to reduce prison costs.</TE>
<TE>   "I make no apologies for being here," he said. "This was a
legitimate legislative conference."</TE>
<TE>   Cox added: "I would have gone to Bakersfield if that's where the
event was."</TE>
<TE>   "But I might have stayed home," interjected his wife, Maggie,
drawing a sharp look from her husband.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson looked well-rested Saturday as he
reclined on a lounge chair overlooking azure waves and the black rock
cliff of Pu'u Keka'a.</TE>
<TE>   But Wesson, wearing shorts, a tan polo shirt and bright white
tennis shoes, said the trip, pleasant as it may have been, would not
change the fact that he gives the state's prison guards no more
consideration than any other special interest group in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Taking the Heat</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes when you're an elected official you have to take the
heat," said the Culver City Democrat. "I can take the heat."</TE>
<TE>   Wesson said he worked throughout the trip. Even during a dinner of
filet mignon and coconut-crusted mahi mahi at a Lahaina restaurant,
Wesson said he and Cox worked -- handling Assembly housekeeping
duties such as committee and seating assignments.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson said no taxpayer money will be spent for Assembly members
traveling to Maui. His trip, as well as his wife's and a staff
member's, will be paid for with campaign funds, which can be spent on
travel so long as it involves a political, legislative or
governmental purpose.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Brulte, the Senate's Republican leader, plans to pay for his
trip from his officeholder account -- a fund to which people and
corporations can donate to cover a lawmaker's expenses. After losing
a golf tournament Saturday afternoon and using the Internet in the
hotel's business center to check the results of a Senate race in
Louisiana, Brulte said he would take a nap.</TE>
<TE>   He brushed aside those who suggest it was inappropriate for
legislators to gather with leaders of the prison guards union even as
Davis was unveiling potentially far-reaching budget cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "Should I turn down an invitation to speak in Hawaii simply
because Gray Davis has bankrupted California?" said Brulte. "I don't
think so."</TE>
<TE>   Other people on the trip included Sens. Roy Ashburn
(R-Bakersfield) and Jim Battin (R-La Quinta) and Assemblyman Russ
Bogh (R-Cherry Valley). Also attending was Board of Equalization
member Bill Leonard, a former legislator.</TE>

<HD>Currents of Uncertainty Make Vote in Water War Anything but
'Final'</HD>
<DH>If Imperial Valley OKs sale of Colorado River supply, many
factors could challenge deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EL CENTRO</DL>
<LD>EL CENTRO -- Even if the Imperial Irrigation District approves a
75-year deal to sell water to San Diego County and save coastal
Southern California from a threatened cutback in its water supply,
the complex pact could be scuttled through disagreement or
exhaustion, officials concede.</LD>
<LD>   A vote by the water district in this conservative farming region
is looming as early as this evening, and the Bush administration is
talking tough about cutting off the tap from the Colorado River if
the water district doesn't agree to a deal to send water to the
coast.</LD>
<LD>   But the administration's sign-or-else Dec. 31 deadline could prove
to be a toothless tiger, and it is highly likely that the Imperial
district could delay a decision for months without California losing
a drop.</LD>
<TE>   Welcome to the world of Western water policy, where nothing
happens quickly, things are often not as they appear, and time, as
former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt was fond of saying, is
measured not in months and years but in decades.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is the federal government's attempt -- first under
Babbitt and now Interior Secretary Gale Norton -- to persuade the
farmers of Imperial Valley to sell some of their enormous share of
the Colorado River to San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   The prospective sale is also supported by the state government,
which sees it as a solution to federal officials' demand that
California reduce its overall use of Colorado River water. Other
Western states are pressuring Washington to ween California off
surplus water above its legal entitlement.</TE>
<TE>   After marathon negotiations guided by Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg
(D-Sherman Oaks), the four agencies involved in the prospective water
sale -- the Imperial district, the San Diego County Water Authority,
the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, and the
Coachella Valley Water District -- reached a tentative agreement Oct.
15.</TE>
<TE>   But to get even such a preliminary deal, the parties used a
strategy common to water disputes: agreeing to delay deciding key
details until sometime in the indefinite future.</TE>
<TE>   Sticky Details</TE>
<TE>   One of those sticky details involves potential damage to the
Salton Sea -- the smelly, discolored body of water that straddles
Riverside and Imperial counties and depends on agricultural runoff
from the Imperial Valley for its continued existence.</TE>
<TE>   If Imperial Valley sells water to San Diego, that means less
runoff for the Salton Sea. Less runoff means the sea will shrink, the
water will become even saltier, and birds and fish will become
increasingly imperiled.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law requires partners in a water deal to pay for any
environmental damage resulting from that deal. Officials at the
Imperial Irrigation District, however, are worried that their
district will get stuck with a bill for "fixing" the sea, which could
run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Kirk, executive director of the Salton Sea Authority, is
disappointed that the tentative agreement reached Oct. 15 does little
to address the long-term problems of the Salton Sea. Even the "final"
agreement before the irrigation district today proposes, at best,
only a temporary solution: For the first 15 years of the 75-year
agreement, the Imperial Irrigation District would provide enough
water to stabilize the sea.</TE>
<TE>   "When government faces a tough choice, it often postpones a
decision or appoints a commission," Kirk said. "With the Salton Sea,
it's done the former."</TE>
<TE>   Kirk also said he agrees with the Imperial Valley farmers that
they could be "left holding the bag" for the sea's problems.</TE>
<TE>   But even the temporary solution for the sea has a major snag:
state and federal regulations that prohibit diverting Colorado River
water directly to the Salton Sea.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada and Arizona officials have already warned of dire
consequences (read: litigation) if California tries to save the sea
by using water from the river. (Such suits would claim that use of
Colorado River water for the Salton Sea is not a "beneficial" use, as
defined in arcane state and federal law.)</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Interior Secretary Bennett Raley, meeting Thursday with
the Imperial board, suggested that the federal government would not
object if river water made its way to the Salton Sea. A suggestion,
however, is not a promise, and farmers and board members did not
appear to be placated by Raley's words.</TE>
<TE>   Imperial lawyer David Osias, after Raley left, said the next year
will be consumed by negotiations among the four agencies about the
Salton Sea and who will pay for its restoration. Without an agreement
on that point, the deal will not survive, Osias said.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the Salton Sea, there are still details involving how
money paid by San Diego County will be used to offset hardships
potentially caused by taking farmland out of production: loss of jobs
for farm workers, possible reduction in sales and property taxes to
run local governments and schools, and loss of revenue for
farm-dependent businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The tentative settlement calls for a three-person governing board
to make decisions about disbursements. But history suggests that the
Imperial district finds it difficult, if not impossible, to make sure
that such money filters down to farm workers and others.</TE>
<TE>   About $13 million from a previous water deal a decade ago sits in
a bank account, unused.</TE>
<TE>   If the Salton Sea and "third-party" impact problems are not
enough, there is also the matter of voluntarism and widespread
opposition to water sales among farmers, many of whom are the
descendants of pioneers who turned Imperial Valley from a desert
wasteland into a place of agricultural bounty.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing in the would-be agreement forces any individual farmer to
reduce his or her water use to sell it to San Diego. If not enough
farmers sign up, the deal cannot succeed.</TE>
<TE>   One scenario is that farmers will balk at the price being offered
and demand more money. The Oct. 15 agreement sets a base price of
$258 per acre-foot for water that costs the farmers $15.50.</TE>
<TE>   But farmers insist that those numbers are misleading and that San
Diego officials and editorialists who say the farmers are being
offered windfall profits are wrong. They note that from the $258 per
acre-foot, the Imperial district will take a slice for overhead, and
farmers will need to use much of the rest to pay for water
conservation infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   By one estimate, neither the Imperial district nor any farmer will
see a profit from the water deal for two decades. Their resentment
over being characterized as greedy is palpable.</TE>
<TE>   Nation Is Watching</TE>
<TE>   "Our families came out here a hundred years ago and busted their
humps making this desert bloom," said Imperial board member Bruce
Kuhn. "We know the eyes of the state and national government are upon
us, but we're not going to go bankrupt to send water to the coast."</TE>
<TE>   Raley said that if Imperial does not approve the agreement, he
will immediately suspend the rules that allow California to receive
surplus water from the Colorado River. For years the Metropolitan
Water District, which serves 17 million people in six counties, has
received 600,000 to 800,000 acre-feet of surplus water each year --
enough for upward of 6 million people.</TE>
<TE>   Though the rules would be suspended immediately, reducing the flow
of surplus water to California could take months, maybe an entire
year, Raley said. And what would happen if the Imperial district,
say, approved the agreement in March?</TE>
<TE>   The surplus rules would be reinstated without California having
lost a pint of the liquid gold.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the face of opposition and outright animosity in the
Imperial Valley, Raley remains confident that a deal is possible. A
water lawyer in Colorado before joining President Bush's
administration, he said he is not discouraged by the complexities of
water negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a reason in the 1931 seven-party agreement [allocating
the Colorado River among Western states] that this was not all worked
out," said Raley. "This is hard stuff."</TE>

<HD>Abducted as Infant, Boy, 6, Is Found</HD>
<DH>He was living less than two miles from home with a woman
suspected of killing his mother.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a rainy spring day in 1996, 4-week-old Le-Zahn Williams was
abducted from his home in Vallejo, Calif. The suspected kidnapper
left behind his mother's murdered body, set aflame.</LD>
<LD>   For years, police chased leads across the country, and desperate
family members turned to television programs such as "Unsolved
Mysteries" to air their plight: "Where is Le-Zahn?" they asked.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, in a breakthrough that shocked relatives, police
believe they found the boy, now 6 years old, living with the
22-year-old woman suspected of killing his mother. The boy was
growing up in a house less than two miles from his real family's
home.</LD>
<TE>   "It's overwhelming," Henrietta Williams, Le-Zahn's paternal
grandmother, said at a Sunday gathering of the boy's relatives. "That
makes me feel really sad. We couldn't find him, and he was so close."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Vallejo police acting on an anonymous tip arrested
22-year-old Latasha Brown on suspicion of kidnapping and murder.
Brown's mother, Dolores Ann Brown, 44, also was arrested on a child
concealment charge.</TE>
<TE>   Police suspect that Latasha Brown may have had a relationship with
the boy's father, Lathan Williams, and acted out of jealousy.
Williams, a local rapper now serving a prison sentence for armed
robbery, dedicated one of his CDs to his son and slain ex-girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   "He is very happy that his baby is OK," said Henrietta Williams,
who notified her son over the weekend. Family members hope to be
reunited this week with Le-Zahn, who they said remains in the custody
of Child Protective Services.</TE>
<TE>   Police told them that the boy is in good health and had attended
local schools. Family members said Le-Zahn had been raised believing
that Brown was his biological mother.</TE>
<TE>   Latasha Brown is suspected of killing Le-Zahn's 17-year-old
mother, Daphne Boyden, in May 1996 in the home that Boyden shared
with her mother and son. On the day Boyden was killed, police said
neighbors saw two women entering the residence less than an hour
before it burst into flames.</TE>
<TE>   Family members said they never lost hope during their long ordeal.
Henrietta Williams kept a key chain with a picture of Le-Zahn. His
maternal grandmother, Riva Lee Boyden, hung several portraits of her
grandson around her home. The pictures were taken when the boy was
only 16 days old.</TE>
<TE>   Family members expressed concern for Le-Zahn's emotional health as
he adjusts to life with his real family. But they plan to provide him
a normal life, showered with love.</TE>
<TE>   "I only knew him for a few days ... I don't know what he looks
like now," Boyden said, "but everything is rosy, rosy."</TE>

<HD>Letter From Bishops Draws Mixed Reactions</HD>
<DH>Divisions within the Catholic Church are reflected in the
way parishioners take the warnings of more sexual-abuse lawsuits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Wilson and Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Father Martin Benzoni paused uncomfortably midway through his Sunday
Mass at St. John the Baptist Catholic Church.</LD>
<LD>   "You may have read about the letter," he told parishioners at the
Costa Mesa church.</LD>
<LD>   With that, he turned from the day's lesson of St. John wandering
in the desert 2,000 years ago to a letter by the state's 12 bishops
warning of a possible onslaught of costly new sexual-abuse lawsuits
against the church and its clergy.</LD>
<TE>   In Roman Catholic churches across California, many -- but not all
-- priests took to the pulpit to read the letter, which outlined
changes in state law that waive the statute of limitations on
sexual-abuse charges through 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "This law allows people to file lawsuits against dioceses and
California employees based upon claims that rose many decades ago,"
the letter said. "The Catholic Church has been falsely portrayed as a
large corporation with 'deep pockets.' "</TE>
<TE>   Reaction from parishioners was mixed, reflecting deep divisions
within the church.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like the new law," said Darlene Powers, 70, who has
attended St.John's for 20 years. "Every 10-year-old knows to go tell
their parents if someone touched the.... If you're 40, and you were
abused when you were in high school, it's water down the drain."</TE>
<TE>   St. John's is one of many churches across the country caught in
the scandal. A former pastor was placed on paid leave in November
after he was accused in a lawsuit of sexually abusing a boy in the
early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Catherine Hicks of Los Angeles attended church at St. Paul the
Apostle in Westwood, where the bishops' letter was tucked in the
weekly bulletin but not read aloud. She was unimpressed by concerns
expressed by the bishops that churches could be bankrupted by the new
law.</TE>
<TE>   "So? The church started with nothing, and we can start over with
nothing," Hicks said. "The bad priests should not be protected. I
think the parishioners should be talking about it weekly."</TE>
<TE>   At Ventura's 220-year-old San Buenaventura Mission, Msgr. Patrick
J. O'Brien read the letter at the noon Mass, then moved on. Church
member Jim Stiffler said he was upset that there was no further
comment, saying it was all too typical of the church's reaction to
allegations from the scandal's outset.</TE>
<TE>   "When he started to read it, it was in such a businesslike
manner," said Stiffler, a manufacturer of aircraft parts who lives in
Oxnard. "There was no compassion to it. I just didn't want to hear
it."</TE>
<TE>   Stiffler said that the state law "won't do any good for the
church" but added that top church officials should be blamed for the
losses any individual parishes might suffer.</TE>
<TE>   "The hierarchy never took care of the problem," he said. "When you
get down to it, they handled it terribly."</TE>
<TE>   At Our Lady of the Assumption in Ventura, parishioner Jim Farley
was highly critical of the law, contending that it's nothing more
than a get-rich-quick scheme for people who see the church as an easy
target.</TE>
<TE>   "Priests who violated children should be prosecuted," said Farley,
a well-known defense attorney and a deacon at his church. "But I
think we're way beyond that now. We're now heavily into the greed
factor."</TE>
<TE>   The law could cripple day-to-day operations at some parishes and
would never have been passed if the prime target were a school
district, a government agency or a corporation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   At Holy Family Cathedral in Orange, Jim Watson, 31, a lawyer from
Orange, said he was glad the letter was read.</TE>
<TE>   "The parish is being upfront, aggressive and reassuring, so that
was very helpful," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, members of the national Survivors Network of Those Abused
by Priests handed out fliers and a letter from the mother of an
alleged abuse victim. Sherida Ruiz, 54, said she was there to
encourage parishioners to hear both sides of the story and let them
know that it is OK for them to come forward.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz alleged that her son, who is now 33, was molested by a priest
when he was 10. She said he is contemplating whether to sue under the
new law.</TE>
<TE>   "This is protecting our children and seeking justice, not fighting
the statute of limitations," Ruiz said of the new law.</TE>
<TE>   After reading the letter at St. John's in Costa Mesa, Father
Benzoni groaned before returning to the day's Gospel readings.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate these things," he said. "But they're important. They're
important."</TE>

<CX>   Accused priest -- An article in Monday's California section about a
letter read in Catholic churches on Sunday incorrectly reported the
date that a former pastor of St. John the Baptist Catholic Church in
Costa Mesa was put on leave after he was accused of molesting a boy
in the 1980s. He was placed on leave in November 2001, not last
month.</CX>

<HD>Breaking the Language Barrier</HD>
<DH>Classes help Mixtec farm workers first learn Spanish and
then English.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandra Murillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a dreary Friday night in Oxnard, and instructor Noemi Quiros
lays out her Spanish books, hoping the rain won't keep all her
students away.</LD>
<LD>   It doesn't. About 10 minutes later, two men whisper apologies for
their tardiness as they take their seats.</LD>
<LD>   It may be a typical night-school scenario, but this is not a
typical class.</LD>
<TE>   The students, Mixtec Indians from southern Mexico, came to the
United States speaking only an indigenous language known as Mixteco.
They work in Ventura County's many farm fields, unable to understand
either the Spanish of their fellow workers or the English of their
bosses.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing this disadvantage, they've come to Quiros' class to
catch up.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult for them to walk around with any confidence," said
Antonio Flores, 24, a Mixtec outreach worker at California Rural
Legal Assistance, who began running the classes in August with the
help of several volunteers. "They're scared of being robbed, of being
stopped by police. They end up isolating themselves, essentially like
birds in a cage."</TE>
<TE>   The classes, taught twice a week at the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints on Elm Street, range from beginning Spanish to
conversational English. The students learn to speak and write in
Spanish first and then tackle English.</TE>
<TE>   Farm worker Fidel Rivera, 24, remembers feeling isolated when he
arrived from Oaxaca. He was scolded in English as he was learning how
to work the fields but was unable to understand the problem. He felt
embarrassed.</TE>
<TE>   "People treated us like we were so strange," Rivera said.</TE>
<TE>   Mixtecs -- about 80,000 in California, according to some studies
-- are younger, poorer and more likely to be in this country
illegally than the rest of California's low-wage farm workers. Their
inability to communicate and the lack of Mixteco-speaking advocates
make them vulnerable to dishonest growers.</TE>
<TE>   Outreach workers estimate that there are up to 10,000 indigenous
workers in Ventura County. Throughout the state, efforts to reach the
Mixtecs are underway. California Rural Legal Assistance and other
farm worker advocacy groups have expanded efforts to educate them
about labor laws and their civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   In Oxnard, dozens of Mixtecs go to Las Islas Family Clinic, where
they are given food, clothing and other services. The clinic also
offers a weekly Spanish literacy course.</TE>
<TE>   Three years after arriving in the U.S., Rivera has worked
alongside enough Spanish-speakers to pick up most of the language.
But without English, he knows he's only halfway to having a voice.</TE>
<TE>   So he comes to the Oxnard church every weekend, joining other
Mixtecs taking on their third language.</TE>
<TE>   Next door, a beginning class attempts to sound out words from
children's Spanish books. Quiros patiently guides Maximino Lopez and
Tomas Mendoza through various Spanish sounds and syllables. Neither
knows how to read or write.</TE>
<TE>   Paloma, the Spanish word for pigeon or dove, is causing them some
trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't guess," she scolds them gently. "You're supposed to be
sounding out the words. Just play with the sounds we've learned and
you'll get it."</TE>
<TE>   "It'll take me a half-hour," Lopez said, joking.</TE>
<TE>   During the last few minutes of class, Quiros gives a basic math
lesson in the hope that the men will learn enough to recognize when
they're being cheated.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want you guys to distrust people," Quiros said after a
lesson on counting money. "I just want you to be careful and be able
to protect yourself."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez is from the impoverished Mexican state of Oaxaca, where he
tended goats on a family farm before economic troubles drove him
across the border to find work in Oxnard's raspberry fields. He's had
his share of trouble with growers who took advantage of his limited
language, he said. Once, he was given a bad check for a week's worth
of work.</TE>
<TE>   "We went to cash it and there were no funds, but there was nothing
we could do," Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   He concentrates now on learning Spanish, so he can finally write a
letter home. Someone in his village will translate, and his family,
whom he hasn't seen in four years, will know that he's OK. In it,
he'll promise to return soon, although Lopez said that may be wishful
thinking.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I'll ever make enough money to go home for good,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Flores said he had no trouble recruiting volunteers to teach
classes.</TE>
<TE>   Quiros, a housecleaner from Oxnard, jokingly said she got involved
because she's "a busybody." But she also was looking for a way to
help Mixtecs, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I would always see them among themselves, speaking in their
language, and I wondered how they could accomplish the simplest
tasks," Quiros said. "I mean, if your language is so totally
different from ours, how do you get through a visit to the
supermarket, the Laundromat? How isolated must you feel when you
can't even understand the signs?"</TE>
<TE>   But Mixtec farm worker Rivera said he no longer feels so alone.</TE>
<TE>   "I speak good Spanish now and can defend myself pretty well around
Spanish speakers," he said. "If I can learn Spanish, then English
can't be so bad."</TE>

<LD>Ooh, what a come-on -- just the kind of thing the rest of the country
loves to use to point to "those California wackos."</LD>
<LD>   The subject of the state Senate's insurance committee
informational hearing last week: "Haunted Houses: Do claims make
houses uninsurable in California?"</LD>
<LD>   Before all you movie producers climb aboard a plane for
Sacramento, read on.</LD>
<TE>   The hearing concerned the state of homeowners insurance in
California. Committee chair Jackie Speier, a Hillsborough Democrat,
heard allegations of manipulation -- that, in violation of Prop. 103,
some insurance companies are using credit information to create an
insurance "score" that determines whether home buyers will be offered
insurance. Speier's office says that in her district, it can
sometimes be easier to buy a house than to buy insurance for it,
except under the last-resort California Fair Plan or Lloyd's of
London.</TE>
<TE>   A retired San Francisco cop recounted how he told his insurance
company that he lost his wedding ring and asked whether it was
covered under his homeowner's policy. Even though he never got an
answer, much less any reimbursement, he said that his insurer
evidently filed his question as a "claim." When he switched to
another insurer, it promptly canceled him for not telling them he had
made a "claim" on his earlier policy.</TE>
<TE>   As for the haunted house part, the committee heard from a woman
who paid premiums for more than 20 years and, after a few
roof-leaking claims for water damage totaling $2,000, she found her
house is considered uninsurable, except through a higher-priced
Lloyds of London policy.</TE>
<TE>   Even though she fixed the problem, her house is now "haunted" with
a kind of insurers' felony record as a bad risk. The new roof doesn't
exorcise its "record."</TE>
<TE>   And that really is scary.</TE>
<TE>   Sister Countries Are Anyone's Guess</TE>
<TE>   The signs, they are a-changin'. Last week's repeat episode of "The
West Wing" dwelt on tensions between the People's Republic of China
and Taiwan -- and the city of Los Angeles was also avoiding an
international incident, on the mainland.</TE>
<TE>   A monument to L.A.'s score of sister cities no longer refers to
the actual nations where one would find those 20 cities.</TE>
<TE>   When the 32-foot signpost went up in September near City Hall,
China complained that Taipei was identified as a city in Taiwan. More
than a half-century after the Nationalist Chinese fled the Communist
revolution for the island now known as Taiwan, China still considers
Taiwan to be a renegade province.</TE>
<TE>   To appease the Chinese -- and smooth Mayor James K. Hahn's
panda-hunting trade trip last month to Asia -- Los Angeles briefly
changed the sign to place Taipei under Chinese control.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that offended the Taiwanese.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the man who dreamed up the signs, council member Tom
LaBonge, stripped all the country names off the cities. Admirers of
the sign will have to puzzle out on their own the home countries of
Kaunas (Lithuania) and Lusaka (Zambia).</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge joked that he'd add one more "little directional sign --
to the library over at Fifth and Flower -- the geography section."
And that would be in L.A., in the U.S. of A., but don't tell anyone
we said so.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood's Reluctant Republicans</TE>
<TE>   Look under "Democrat" in the encyclopedia and you might find Mike
Medavoy's picture. The A-list Hollywood producer has donated early
and often to Democratic candidates and causes.</TE>
<TE>   Not long ago, he got one more phone call asking, in rather an
oblique way, for money.</TE>
<TE>   But this came from Republicans, on behalf of newly minted House
majority leader Tom DeLay. The caller told Medavoy that for a $500
donation toward a pro-Bush administration ad in the Wall Street
Journal, he could receive a National Leadership Award, and be an
honorary chairman of the Business Advisory Council, which is, its
phone line says, "a project of the National Republican Congressional
Committee."</TE>
<TE>   Medavoy's assistant, Jeff Steele, checked it out, and Medavoy
asked him to call back and leave this message: "This is a scam to get
money for Tom DeLay's PAC, or whatever it is. If he calls me about
giving money to poor people or disadvantaged people, I'm more than
happy to do this, but I'm not going to be pulled into this one."</TE>
<TE>   Steele did call, and then, puckishly, proposed that he get the
award instead.</TE>
<TE>   Medavoy described Steele's phone exchange: They agreed to give
Steele the honors, "just send us 500 bucks. Jeff said, 'I don't have
it.' They said, 300? 'Sorry, I can't.' 'Well, send us a hundred.' 'I
don't have a hundred.' 'OK, OK, you've got it anyway,' the voice on
the other end responded.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeff," declared his boss, "was having fun."</TE>
<TE>   Medavoy says someone already sent him a membership card to the
Republican National Congressional Committee -- why, he isn't sure.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe because I had a subscription to [something related to] Fox
News -- or the Wall Street Journal."</TE>
<TE>   Beltway Showdown Over Soda</TE>
<TE>   More cola wars -- in the Beltway.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic Rep. Henry A. Waxman, the ranking Democrat on the
committee on government reform, zapped off a letter to Health and
Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson demanding to know why the
U.S. is balking at a World Health Organization draft report that
calls for cutting down on soda drinking in a campaign to fight
obesity.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. argued in its formal comments that "evidence that soft
drinks are associated with obesity is not compelling."</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. opposition to WHO's efforts to fight obesity around the
world," Waxman wrote in dudgeon, "needs an explanation."</TE>
<TE>   In Waxman's own backyard, L.A.'s board of education banned soft
drinks sales at all 677 schools after recent reports found high rates
of obesity in young children -- some of whom received more than 10%
of their daily calories from soft drinks. Children's obesity has
doubled in more than two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Coca-Cola relied in 2001 on foreign markets for 62% of its $20.1
billion in sales and 76% of its $4-billion profit. During World War
II, Coke persuaded the U.S. government to ship its drink wherever
military forces went, across the globe.</TE>
<TE>   Point Taken</TE>
<TE>   * A Sacramento jury has levied a $4.5-million judgment on the
state's Department of Education and departing Supt. Delaine Eastin on
behalf of an adult-education consultant who says he was unfairly
demoted after blowing the whistle about federal money being misused
by community groups that were supposed to offer adult English
classes. Federal criminal charges were later brought against
operators of adult programs in Sacramento and Los Angeles. Department
officials say they intend to appeal.</TE>

to hang a big plaque with the words "In God We Trust" in the City

council member who supported the plaque and wasn't reelected --
flipped the vote.</TE>

<HD>Fish Farms Become Feedlots of the Sea</HD>
<DH>Like cattle pens, the salmon operations bring product to
market cheaply. But harm to ocean life and possibly human health has
experts worried.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth R. Weiss</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PORT McNEILL, Canada</DL>
<LD>If you bought a salmon filet in the supermarket recently or ordered one in
a restaurant, chances are it was born in a plastic tray here, or a place
just like it.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of streaking through the ocean or leaping up rocky
streams, it spent three years like a marine couch potato, circling
lazily in pens, fattening up on pellets of salmon chow.</LD>
<LD>   It was vaccinated as a small fry to survive the diseases that race
through these oceanic feedlots, acres of net-covered pens tethered
offshore. It was likely dosed with antibiotics to ward off infection
or fed pesticides to shed a beard of bloodsucking sea lice.</LD>
<TE>   For that rich, pink hue, the fish was given a steady diet of
synthetic pigment. Without it, the flesh of these caged salmon would
be an unappetizing, pale gray.</TE>
<TE>   While many chefs and seafood lovers snub the feedlot variety as
inferior to wild salmon, fish farming is booming. What was once a
seasonal delicacy now is sometimes as cheap as chicken and available
year-round. Now, the hidden costs of mass-producing these once-wild
fish are coming into focus.</TE>
<TE>   Begun in Norway in the late 1960s, salmon farming has spread
rapidly to cold-water inlets around the globe. Ninety-one salmon
farms now operate in British Columbian waters. The number is expected
to reach 200 or more in the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   Industrial fish farming raises many of the same concerns about
chemicals and pollutants that are associated with feedlot cattle and
factory chicken farms. So far, however, government scientists worry
less about the effects of antibiotics, pesticides and artificial dyes
on human health than they do about damage to the marine environment.</TE>
<TE>   "They're like floating pig farms," said Daniel Pauly, professor of
fisheries at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. "They
consume a tremendous amount of highly concentrated protein pellets
and they make a terrific mess."</TE>
<TE>   Fish wastes and uneaten feed smother the sea floor beneath these
farms, generating bacteria that consume oxygen vital to shellfish and
other bottom-dwelling sea creatures.</TE>
<TE>   Disease and parasites, which would normally exist in relatively
low levels in fish scattered around the oceans, can run rampant in
densely packed fish farms.</TE>
<TE>   Pesticides fed to the fish and toxic copper sulfate used to keep
nets free of algae are building up in sea-floor sediments.
Antibiotics have created resistant strains of disease that infect
both wild and domesticated fish.</TE>
<TE>   Clouds of sea lice, incubated by captive fish on farms, swarm wild
salmon as they swim past on their migration to the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the concerns, the biggest turns out to be a problem fish
farms were supposed to help alleviate: the depletion of marine life
from overfishing.</TE>
<TE>   These fish farms contribute to the problem because the captive
salmon must be fed. Salmon are carnivores and, unlike vegetarian
catfish that are fed grain on farms, they need to eat fish to bulk up
fast and remain healthy.</TE>
<TE>   It takes about 2.4 pounds of wild fish to produce one pound of
farmed salmon, according to Rosamond L. Naylor, an agricultural
economist at Stanford's Center for Environmental Science and Policy.</TE>
<TE>   That means grinding up a lot of sardines, anchovies, mackerel,
herring and other fish to produce the oil and meal compressed into
pellets of salmon chow.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not taking strain off wild fisheries. We are adding to
it," Naylor said. "This cannot be sustained forever."</TE>
<TE>   In British Columbia, the industry, under pressure from
environmentalists, marine scientists and local newspapers, is taking
steps to mitigate some of the ecological problems.</TE>
<TE>   "We have made some mistakes in the past and we acknowledge them,"
said Mary Ellen Walling, executive director of the British Columbia
Salmon Farmers Assn. "We feel the industry is sustainable, if
well-managed, and we have a code of practices that is followed by all
of our member companies."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 30 farms are preparing to move to less ecologically fragile
areas, under orders from Canadian authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Some farms have installed underwater video cameras to detect when
fish quit feeding, so workers can stop scattering food pellets. Many
farms are switching to sturdier nets to stop fish from escaping and
keep out marauding sea lions, which are shot if they penetrate the
perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   The industry now recognizes that it will soon be pushing the
limits of the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   "There will come a time when our industry will use more of the
fish oil and fish meal than is available," said Odd Grydeland, an
executive at Heritage Salmon in British Columbia. "Our biggest
challenge is to find substitute grains for fish meal and fish oil."</TE>
<TE>   Farm-raised salmon now dominates West Coast markets, arriving
daily from Canada and Chile. About 80% of the salmon grown in British
Columbia goes to markets from Seattle to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The salmon industry took off so fast in British Columbia in the
1980s that the provincial government, worried about the environmental
toll, imposed a ban in 1995 on any new farms.</TE>
<TE>   The industry responded by stuffing, on average, twice as many fish
into each farm. Today, farms typically put 50,000 to 90,000 fish in a
pen 100 feet by 100 feet. A single farm can grow 400,000 fish. Others
raise a million or more.</TE>
<TE>   The moratorium on new farms was lifted in September by the
provincial government after voters elected a pro-business slate of
lawmakers and administrators. As a result, 10 to 15 farms are
expected to open each year over the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   Five international companies -- three of them based in Norway --
control most of the existing farms. Nearly all are situated around
Vancouver Island, which begins outside Seattle's Puget Sound and
extends up the coast for 300 miles.</TE>
<TE>   It's a lightly populated place of stunning beauty. Cedar, hemlock
and Douglas fir grow right down to the high-water mark.</TE>
<TE>   Massive tides flush rich blue-green waters through the archipelago
of islands, straits, bays and inlets, nurturing five types of wild
salmon. These, in turn, attract seals, sea lions, white-sided
dolphins and the world's best known pods of killer whales.</TE>
<TE>   Residents rely on boats and seaplanes to reach surrounding islands
that host many of the farms. Each farm is a cluster of pens, often
interconnected by metal walkways and tethered offshore by a lattice
of steel cables, floats and weights.</TE>
<TE>   In the midst of this idyllic setting, signs of strain on the
marine environment are bubbling to the surface much the way diseases
and parasites, incubated in European salmon farms, fouled the fiords
of Norway and the lochs of Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   In Norway, parasites have so devastated wild fish that the
government poisoned all aquatic life in dozens of rivers and streams
in an effort to re-boot the ecological system.</TE>
<TE>   "The Norwegian companies are transferring the same operations here
that have been used in Europe," said Pauly, the fisheries professor.
"So we can infer that every mistake that has been done in Norway and
Scotland will be replicated here."</TE>
<TE>   Dale Blackburn, vice president of West Coast operations for
Norwegian-based Stolt Sea Farm, said his staff works very closely
with its counterparts in Norway. But, he said, "It's ridiculous to
think we don't learn from our mistakes and transfer technology
blindly."</TE>
<TE>   Still, more than a dozen farms in British Columbia have been
stricken by infectious hematopoietic necrosis, a virus that attacks
the kidneys and spleen of fish.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanine Siemens, manager of a Stolt farm, said, "It was really
hard for me and the crew" to oversee the killing of 900,000 young
salmon last August because of a viral outbreak.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a boat pumping dead fish every day," she said. "It took a
couple of weeks. But it was the best decision. You are at risk of
infecting other farms."</TE>
<TE>   Farms are typically required to bury the dead in landfills to
protect wild marine life and the environment. But Grieg Seafood
recently got an emergency permit from the Canadian government to dump
in the Pacific 900 tons of salmon killed by a toxic algae bloom. The
emergency? The weight of the dead fish threatened to sink the entire
farm.</TE>
<TE>   About 1 million live Atlantic salmon -- favored by farmers because
they grow fast and can be packed in tight quarters -- have escaped
through holes in nets and storm-wrecked farms in the Pacific
Northwest.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists fear these invaders will out-compete Pacific salmon and
trout for food and territory, hastening the demise of the native
fish. An Atlantic salmon takeover could knock nature's balance out of
whack and turn a healthy, diverse marine habitat into one dominated
by a single invasive species.</TE>
<TE>   Preserving diversity is essential, biologists say, because
multiple species of salmon have a better chance of surviving than
just one.</TE>
<TE>   John Volpe, a fisheries ecologist at the University of Alberta,
has been swimming rivers with snorkel and mask to document the spread
of Atlantic salmon and their offspring.</TE>
<TE>   "In the majority of rivers, I find Atlantic salmon," Volpe said.
"We know they are out there; we just don't know how many, or what to
do about them."</TE>
<TE>   His research focuses on how Atlantic salmon can colonize, if given
a chance. It has terrified the U.S. neighbors to the north. Alaskan
officials banned fish farms in 1990 to protect their wild fishery. So
they don't take kindly to British Columbian farms creeping toward
their southern border.</TE>
<TE>   Although native Pacific salmon are rare and endangered in the
Lower 48, Alaska's salmon fisheries are so healthy they have earned
the Marine Stewardship Council's eco-label as "sustainable." The
council's labels are designed to guide consumers to species that are
not being overharvested.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the prospect of genetically modified salmon that can
grow six times faster than normal fish has heightened anxiety. Aqua
Bounty Farms Inc., of Waltham, Mass., is seeking U.S. and Canadian
approval to alter genes to produce a growth hormone that could shave
a year off the usual 2 1/2 to three years it takes to raise a
market-size fish.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial fishermen and other critics fear that these
"frankenfish" will escape and pose an even greater danger to native
species than do the Atlantic salmon.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody can predict just what that means for our wild salmon,"
Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles said. "We do see it as a threat."</TE>
<TE>   Canadian commercial fishermen, initially supportive of salmon
farms, have grown increasingly hostile. They were stunned in August
when their nets came up nearly empty during the first day of the wild
pink salmon season in the Broughton Archipelago at the northeast end
of Vancouver Island.</TE>
<TE>   "There should have been millions of pinks, but there were fewer
than anyone can remember," said Calvin Siider, a salmon gill-netter.
"We can't prove that sea lice caused it. But common sense tells you
something, if they are covered by sea lice as babies, and they don't
come back as adults."</TE>
<TE>   Alexandra Morton, an independent biologist and critic of salmon
farms, began examining sea lice in 2001 when a fishermen brought her
two baby pink salmon covered with them.</TE>
<TE>   Collecting more than 700 baby pink salmon around farms, she found
that 78% were covered with a fatal load of sea lice, which burrow
into fish and feed on skin, mucous and blood. Juvenile salmon she
netted farther from the farms were largely lice-free.</TE>
<TE>   Bud Graham, British Columbia's assistant deputy minister of
agriculture, food and fisheries, called this a "unique phenomenon."</TE>
<TE>   "We have not seen that before. We really don't understand it," he
said. "We've not had sea lice problems in our waters, compared to
Scotland and Ireland."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon farmers point out that the sea louse exists in the wild.
Their captive fish are unlikely hosts, the farmers say, because at
the first sign of an outbreak, they add the pesticide emamectin
benzoate to the feed.</TE>
<TE>   Under Canadian rules, farmers must halt the use of pesticides 25
days before harvest to make sure all residues are flushed from the
fish. If that's done, officials said, pesticides should pose no
danger to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   European health officials have debated whether there is any human
health risk from synthetic pigment added to the feed to give farmed
salmon their pink hue.</TE>
<TE>   In the wild, salmon absorb carotenoid from eating pink krill. On
the farm, they get canthaxanthin manufactured by Hoffman-La Roche.
The pharmaceutical company distributes its trademarked SalmoFan,
similar to paint store swatches, so fish farmers can choose among
various shades.</TE>
<TE>   Europeans are suspicious of canthaxanthin, which was linked to
retinal damage in people when taken as a sunless tanning pill. The
British banned its use as a tanning agent, but it's still available
in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   As for its use in animal feed, the European Commission scientific
committee on animal nutrition issued a warning about the pigment and
urged the industry to find an alternative. But in response, the
British Food Standards Agency took the position that normal
consumption of salmon poses no health risk. No government has banned
the pigment from animal feed.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists in the United States are far more concerned about a
pair of preliminary studies -- one in British Columbia and one in
Great Britain -- that showed farmed salmon accumulate more
cancer-causing PCBs and toxic dioxins than wild salmon.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists in the U.S. are trying to determine the extent of the
contamination in salmon and what levels are safe for human
consumption.</TE>
<TE>   The culprit appears to be the salmon feed, which contains higher
concentrations of fish oil -- extracted from sardines, anchovies and
other ground-up fish -- than wild salmon normally consume. Man-made
contaminants, PCBs and dioxins make their way into the ocean and are
absorbed by marine life.</TE>
<TE>   The pollutants accumulate in fat that is distilled into the
concentrated fish oil, which, in turn, is a prime ingredient of the
salmon feed.</TE>
<TE>   Farmed salmon are far fattier than their wild cousins, although
they do not contain as much of the beneficial omega-3 fatty acids.</TE>
<TE>   The industry complains that environmental activists have
misinterpreted the contaminant studies, needlessly frightening
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "The concern is that people will stop eating fish," said Walling,
of the British Columbia Salmon Farmers Assn. "Salmon is a healthy
food choice. Our Canadian government says this is a safe food."</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists in British Columbia and Scotland recently
launched campaigns urging consumers to boycott farmed salmon until
the industry changes many of its practices.</TE>
<TE>   At the least, they want the farms to switch to solid-walled pens
with catch basins to isolate farmed fish -- and their diseases, pests
and waste -- from the environment. The ideal solution, they say, is
to have the farmed stock raised in landlocked tanks.</TE>
<TE>   Protests notwithstanding, the industry is expected to get a lot
bigger. Demand for seafood is rising and will double by 2040,
according to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization. Nearly
half the world's wild fisheries are exhausted from overfishing, thus
much of the supply will likely come from farmed seafood.</TE>
<TE>   "Aquaculture is here to stay," said Rebecca Goldburg, a biologist
who co-authored a report on the industry for the Pew Oceans
Commission. "The challenge is to ensure that this young industry
grows in a sustainable manner and does not cause serious ecological
damage."</TE>

<LD>   The $15,000 ad is the latest sign of UCI Medical Center's
revved-up campaign to transform its image as the county's hospital
for the poor into that of an innovative health-care center rivaling
the best in the nation.</LD>
<TE>   UCI is not just fighting for patients with the best hospitals in
Orange County, like Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport
Beach, but with top-flight Los Angeles-area medical centers such as
UCLA and Cedars-Sinai, and even the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the medical center is cutting back on care for
the poor, and those beds are being filled by paying patients lured by
the ads in newspapers, magazines and radio highlighting the
hospital's specialists and state-of-the-art equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The ad campaign also has a deeper purpose: to help attract the
attention of potential donors. To meet state earthquake safety
requirements, UCI is planning a $370-million hospital, which
officials there hope will cap its image turnaround. Bonds and other
sources are expected to pay for most of the construction, but UCI
expects to have to raise about $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to let the community know about the facility, and the
visibility [from advertising] can't hurt," said Dr. Ralph Cygan, the
center's chief executive. "We're also trying to tell the
philanthropic community in Orange County it's not a project that
benefits just the university but is a unique resource for the entire
community."</TE>
<TE>   Advertising is not new to the medical center. But this campaign,
which began in May, marks the hospital's most concerted effort with
themed advertising spotlighting UCI's excellence.</TE>
<TE>   One ad touted UCI for having the county's only robotic-assisted
surgery machine. Another announced, "We're making cancer more
treatable." Still another bragged that the medical center was the
only hospital in the county that U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked
among the nation's best, landing 29th in gynecology and 43rd in
treating kidney disease.</TE>
<TE>   When the Web site www.bestdoctors.com listed 40 UCI physicians,
they became the focus of another ad. The same thing happened when a
coalition of mainly Fortune 500 benefit managers called UCI the
safest hospital in California.</TE>
<TE>   Cygan said the new emphasis came about because community and
business leaders, many of them on panels that advise the medical
center or help it raise money, were telling hospital officials they
were doing a poor job of telling its story. The ads are aimed not
only at prospective patients but at doctors who might then be more
likely to make referrals to UCI.</TE>
<TE>   "People haven't associated this facility with high-quality
university health care," Cygan said.</TE>
<TE>   The new campaign targets families likely to have health insurance
that will pay the bills. The ads have appeared in local newspapers
and editions of Time, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated and U.S. News that
are delivered to Orange County's wealthiest ZIP Codes, said Susan
Rayburn, the medical center's vice president of external affairs.</TE>
<TE>   UCI officials would not say exactly how much money they are
spending on advertising. Cygan said the center's $3-million annual
marketing budget has dropped slightly, but a greater proportion now
is devoted to advertising.</TE>
<TE>   UCI is by no means the only area hospital to advertise, especially
around the fall and spring, when businesses allow employees to change
health plans.</TE>
<TE>   Debra Legan, vice president of marketing for Hoag, said the
hospital's ad campaigns result in more phone calls and referrals. The
most successful ads, she said, are those that run on the sides of
buses.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make sure when people are diagnosed with something,
we're on the top of their mind," Legan said.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone is told they have cancer, we want them to know there's
a cancer center at Hoag hospital, and they should check it out."</TE>
<TE>   Hospital advertising was low-key until the mid-1980s. But as
managed care and Medicare changes made health care more competitive,
hospitals began to advertise much more frequently, said Rick Wade,
senior vice president of the American Hospital Assn. in Washington,
D.C. He said that because some units lose money, hospitals must
attract patients for treatments that bring profits.</TE>
<TE>   UCI officials say they are determined to erase the image of the
medical center as the county hospital; it stopped fulfilling that
role after UC Irvine bought it 26 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Four months ago, UCI began cutting back the number of people it
treats under the county's Medical Services for the Indigent program,
which provides care for people age 21 through 64 who earn too much to
qualify for Medi-Cal but aren't old enough for Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   The care is limited to services that protect life or prevent a
significant disability or serious deterioration of health.</TE>
<TE>   Cygan said other Orange County hospitals were not taking in their
share of these patients, that it was costing the medical center too
much money to subsidize them, and that UCI was jammed with too many
poor patients to serve anyone properly or to meet the university
hospital's teaching and research missions.</TE>
<TE>   Despite caring for those from the indigent program and other poor
patients, UCI Medical Center made $30 million last year, Rayburn
said. Much of those profits were funneled to the medical school for
teaching and research.</TE>
<TE>   Rayburn said the heightened advertising campaign was necessary
because research showed that when people were asked to name the
county's best hospitals, they mentioned Hoag and St. Joseph instead
of UCI.</TE>
<TE>   "We had everybody familiar with the academic part of UCI, and that
we were near The Block at Orange," said Pam Rimar, the medical
center's marketing services manager.</TE>
<TE>   The medical center is staffed with 300 doctors on faculty at the
UCI College of Medicine. Dr. Thomas Cesario, dean of the medical
school, said the campaigns help recruit clinical professors who rely
on their practices for much of their income.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to get them here unless we get them access to patients,
and this shows them we will get them access to patients," Cesario
said of the ads.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the doctors themselves are the focus of ads, such as a
recent one on Ralph Clayman, chairman of the department of urology.</TE>
<TE>   He invented a technique that allows surgeons to remove a kidney
using two fingertip-sized incisions, reducing pain and complications
and dramatically improving recovery time.</TE>
<TE>   Another spotlighted Dr. Kenneth Chang, and his technique of using
an endoscope and ultrasound to diagnose gastrointestinal cancer
without surgery.</TE>
<TE>   UCI is working on a new ad campaign expected to debut in February.
Along with a "best doctors and best hospitals" ad, they will push
specific hospital programs, Rayburn said, such as a new geriatric
center or a comprehensive digestive disease center, the first in
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "We want people to think of us as more than the place the
ambulance takes them when they get really sick," Rayburn said.</TE>

<DL>LOS ALAMOS, N.M.</DL>
<LD>A "culture of theft" at Los Alamos National Laboratory costs
taxpayers millions of dollars each year and endangers national
security, according to two investigators recently fired by the
laboratory.</LD>
<LD>   Glenn A. Walp and Steven Doran, both former police officers, say
they were recruited by Los Alamos officials this year to investigate
corruption at the lab, which houses the nation's nuclear secrets and
monitors the quality of the nuclear arsenal.</LD>
<LD>   But after finding far more corruption than Los Alamos officials
suspected -- including hundreds of missing items that could prove
valuable to terrorists or rogue nations -- the investigators were
handed identical letters of dismissal Nov. 25 and escorted from the
laboratory by armed guards.</LD>
<TE>   While becoming yet another embarrassment for the famously troubled
laboratory, the firings have sparked outcries in Congress and
conspiracy charges in the public.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to rue the day they did this," said Pete Stockton,
senior investigator with Project On Government Oversight, a nonprofit
group that monitors waste and fraud in the federal government. "This
ranks as one of the stupidest things I've ever seen an institution
do."</TE>
<TE>   Laboratory officials say the investigators were fired because
their overly aggressive tactics and combative attitude alienated
workers. But the investigators contend they were fired because their
bosses cared less about safeguarding one of the nation's most
important scientific and military sites than about protecting the
image of the University of California, which runs Los Alamos for the
Department of Energy.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamos officials acknowledge that the FBI and the Department
of Energy are looking into several leads turned up by the fired
investigators. Walp and Doran say those leads include glaring lapses
in security -- such as one worker who tried to buy a $30,000
customized Ford Mustang with laboratory money, and another who used
her laboratory credit card to get $2,500 in cash at a casino.</TE>
<TE>   UC officials said Friday that they will urge the Energy Department
to widen its inquiry into Los Alamos to include the firings. "We want
them to address the assertion that [Walp and Doran] may have been
fired in retaliation for [their] investigation," said Michael Reese,
spokesman for UC President Richard Atkinson.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamos -- home in the 1940s to the Manhattan Project, the
nation's historic nuclear weapons program -- has been sullied in
recent years by a series of security breakdowns, including the
disappearance in June 2000 of classified computer hard drives that
later turned up behind a copy machine, and the December 1999
indictment of Wen Ho Lee, a former lab scientist accused of leaking
nuclear secrets to China.</TE>
<TE>   Although nearly all charges eventually were dropped against Lee,
he was found to have removed secret data from the laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   "Through the years there has been ingrained within the laboratory
this culture of theft," said Walp, 61, former head of the
Pennsylvania State Police who was hired to lead the internal security
force at Los Alamos in January. "There is an attitude that [theft] is
the price of doing business."</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamos workers joke about theft increasing around the
holidays, Walp said, because some fill out their Christmas lists with
big-ticket items from the lab. "The problem isn't with scientists,"
Walp said. "They're just there doing their jobs. It's the middle
people."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after arriving at the laboratory, Walp wrote a damning report
that estimated $3 million in equipment had been stolen since 1999.
Among the missing items were more than 260 computers -- some from the
most sensitive areas of the laboratory, where nuclear weapons are
designed.</TE>
<TE>   The report, Walp said, only served to irritate his bosses, who
often told him that his first loyalty was to the University of
California, not the U.S. taxpayer.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamos spokesman Jim Danneskiold dismissed the charge that the
facility is rife with corruption. "There is no culture of theft
here," he said. "People do not walk out of here with property."</TE>
<TE>   Danneskiold said roughly one-tenth of 1% of the lab's $1-billion
inventory disappears each year, far below the percentage that large
retail stores deem acceptable. Many items that appear stolen, he
said, are actually stored in some forgotten Quonset hut or World War
II-era shed.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamos has more than 2,000 buildings on its 40-square-mile
site, he said, and things get mislaid. However, he insisted, "there
is no evidence that there is any classified information on computers
reported as missing."</TE>
<TE>   Although Walp and Doran considered themselves investigators,
Danneskiold said, they had no "investigatory powers" and were hired
to only gather information and act as "liaisons with law
enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   "The reason for terminating their employment was that they had
lost the confidence of different officials they had to work with,
both inside the laboratory and outside," Danneskiold said.</TE>
<TE>   Doran and Walp, however, said it was absurd to expect them to
retain the confidence of workers they were questioning. "It's the
most screwed-up system you ever saw in your life," said Doran, 39,
whom Walp hired at the laboratory in July. "The fox is watching the
chicken house."</TE>
<TE>   Doran also scoffed at the suggestion that missing items were
merely misplaced. "One of the missing items was a 2-ton magnet," he
said. "How ... do you lose a 2-ton magnet?"</TE>
<TE>   Casual attitudes about missing inventory, Doran said, should raise
serious doubts about the laboratory's overall mission. "If you see
the way they handle their money and their property," Doran said,
"what would lead you to believe they do any better with national
security?"</TE>
<TE>   Walp said he suspected that Los Alamos officials generally
preferred a look-the-other-way policy when he learned that one worker
caught stealing $1,800 had been asked quietly to repay the money.
There was no thought of prosecuting, Walp said, although such a theft
of federal property was a felony.</TE>
<TE>   The most shocking case of theft, Walp and Doran said, involved two
workers with access to all top-secret areas. The workers allegedly
went on a brazen spree, using lab purchase orders to acquire hundreds
of items, including spy gear, for reasons that remain unknown.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unbelievable," said Doran, a former Marine and ex-police
chief in Idaho City, Idaho. "They bought camping equipment,
backpacks, lock picks, beacons, radio equipment, high-speed digital
cameras, $9,000 worth of the best knives money can buy, tractors,
lawn mowers, wood chippers, floor sanders, fencing, decks, carports,
high-pressure washers, air conditioning units."</TE>
<TE>   Also, the two workers stole cryogenic freezers, which Doran said
could be useful to anyone developing biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   More frightening, Walp said, the two workers would have been easy
prey for blackmailers hoping to gain entry to the laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys had keys to everything," Walp said. "There wasn't any
nook or cranny in the [restricted] Black Areas they didn't have
access to. All it would take would be for somebody to walk up and
say, 'I know what you're doing, and either you do this for me or I'm
going to the cops.'</TE>
<TE>   "Did it happen? Probably not. Could it happen? Yes."</TE>
<TE>   The two workers have been placed on paid leave, Los Alamos
officials said, while the FBI investigates.</TE>
<TE>   Doran called it unfair and insulting that workers suspected of
felonies remain on paid leave, while he and Walp were summarily
fired.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Doran said, he and Walp received outstanding performance
reviews just before being fired. Walp even got a $5,000 bonus.</TE>
<TE>   Both Walp and Doran have hired lawyers and may file a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   They also may testify before Congress. A spokesman for the House
Committee on Energy and Commerce said the firings have prompted grave
concern among lawmakers, who likely will hold hearings soon and send
a team of their own investigators to Los Alamos in the next few
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "For some time now, the committee has been quietly looking into
operations at Los Alamos," said Ken Johnson, spokesman for Rep. W.J.
(Billy) Tauzin (R-La.), the committee chairman. "But these dramatic
new developments clearly warrant full-scale congressional
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, the accusations are extraordinary, and we're determined
to get to the bottom of this mess."</TE>

<HD>West Comes Up Dry on Plans for Drought</HD>
<DH>Modern trends get in the way of solutions as key reservoirs
fall below capacity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Vartabedian</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES, N.M.</DL>
<LD>Severe drought has ravaged the fabled Rio Grande, leaving expanses of
muck where a 40-mile-long lake once lapped against the desert floor.</LD>
<LD>   The reservoir at Elephant Butte Dam, a lifeline for large portions
of New Mexico and Texas, has dropped 75 feet below the brown
sandstone cliffs at its abutments. The river is so emaciated, it has
even lost its way to the dam, forcing federal workers to dig a
$9-million trench through the muck in hopes of capturing whatever
water does flow.</LD>
<LD>   And for all the demands on the dwindling river, priority goes to
an endangered silvery minnow, which has won a court order that
guarantees its share of the precious water.</LD>
<TE>   Conditions along the Rio Grande mirror the chaos and upheaval in
virtually every major Western watershed, where key reservoirs are
well below capacity and in some cases bone-dry.</TE>
<TE>   "Every indication is that in large portions of the West, we are in
a historic drought," said John W. Keys III, commissioner of the
Bureau of Reclamation, the federal agency that operates 348
reservoirs supplying water to the West.</TE>
<TE>   "Lord only knows how long it will last. I wouldn't even hesitate a
guess."</TE>
<TE>   The history of the West has been punctuated by long periods of
drought, and the prophecy of a water crisis is nothing new.</TE>
<TE>   But increasingly, modern trends -- urban growth, environmental
concerns and climate patterns -- are magnifying weather trends,
placing even greater strains on the limited resources west of the
100th meridian, where the humid East meets the arid West and natural
precipitation cannot support agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   The future holds even more grim news: New studies by climate
experts at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography predict global
warming will aggravate the West's problems.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be more frequent droughts and more severe droughts,"
said climate scientist Tim Barnett of Scripps. "It is not a good
scenario. We have a lot of social decisions to make."</TE>
<TE>   Making those decisions for the future, however, will require
wading through policies of the past: Water use in the West is ruled
by byzantine legal and political structures formed more than 100
years ago. A spaghetti bowl of local, state and federal agencies
oversees the Western watersheds, and conflicts often end up in the
nation's courts.</TE>
<TE>   Though the bureaucratic system has difficulty coping with current
conditions, the future promises even more challenges.</TE>
<TE>   The Scripps Institution, in a series of 15 reports, predicts two
problematic trends. Precipitation levels will drop in many areas,
particularly in the Colorado River Basin where they could decrease
10% and trigger a one-third falloff in water reservoir storage.</TE>
<TE>   Equally threatening is a projection that all across the region
more precipitation will fall as rain, rather than snow, and that
winter snowmelts will occur earlier in the season.</TE>
<TE>   Wildfires will double in size, it predicts.</TE>
<TE>   And with less snow stored in the mountains, hydroelectric
generation in the Pacific Northwest will decrease in the summer when
electricity demands are highest, said Dennis Lettenmaier, a
University of Washington engineering professor who participated in
the Scripps study.</TE>
<TE>   Such disaster scenarios are not far off from what is already
occurring in much of the West in the current drought.</TE>
<TE>   Water levels this year at Lake Powell, the massive Colorado River
impoundment behind the Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona, were the lowest
since the dam was built. Hydrologists say rainfall in the river basin
was the lowest since records began in 1906.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions across the Northwest, from Washington to Montana, are
similarly bleak. Precipitation in the vast Columbia River Basin has
run 50% below normal in recent months, leaving officials worried that
this winter could duplicate the dry conditions of the last two
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Major rivers like the Missouri, Yellowstone, Snake, Pecos,
Colorado, Sacramento and Klamath are all running low and in some
cases at fractions of normal flows. The Rio Grande carried just 13%
of its normal flow this year, according to Bureau of Reclamation
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of acres of farmland are being taken out of production
in Texas, according to Texas Department of Environmental Quality
water master Carlos Rubinstein.</TE>
<TE>   Irrigators and some state officials want the federal government to
shut off water deliveries to Mexico in retaliation for failing to
make good on a half-trillion-gallon water debt owed to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Hill, general manager of Bay View Irrigation District in
Texas, says the only long-term solution is to build a canal from the
Mississippi River to the dry Plains. Such an audacious plan was long
considered in the era of dam building, but abandoned for its
staggering costs and environmental consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Sante Fe, N.M., has declared a Stage 3 water emergency, clamping
tight restrictions on car washing, lawn watering and other routine
activities.</TE>
<TE>   The worst may be coming. Under age-old water laws, the city is
supposed to empty its municipal reservoir into the Rio Grande. State
officials are desperately trying to arrange a water swap to avoid
that step.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions are just the opposite in Yuma, Ariz. While it has not
received any measurable rain in 27 months, it has no shortage of
water. The desert city holds one of the oldest municipal claims to
Colorado River water, according to Yuma Mayor Larry Nelson.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had no adverse impacts in Yuma from the lack of rain," he
said. "But we are conserving water, because it is the right thing to
do."</TE>
<TE>   Across the West, water officials are hoping that a predicted El
Nino weather pattern will bring relief, though it's far from a sure
bet. Even with a wet winter, it would take years to redress the
shortages in much of the region.</TE>
<TE>   California reservoirs are well below normal levels. Shasta Lake,
the state's largest, holds 2.3 million acre-feet, about half of its
capacity. Lake Oroville, ranked second, is storing 1.2 million
acre-feet, about a third of its capacity.</TE>
<TE>   (An acre-foot is enough water to supply two families for about a
year, according to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.)</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the state's sources of water are below normal," said
Jeanine Jones, drought preparedness manager for the California
Department of Water Resources.</TE>
<TE>   The Metropolitan Water District, which supplies most of Southern
California's water, says it has adequate storage for a few years even
if drought continues. It draws from the state's northern dams and the
Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   Lake Mead, the impoundment of the Colorado at Hoover Dam, is about
one-third below full capacity. The Bureau of Reclamation predicts
that the level will continue to drop over the next two years, though
it does not expect to go so low that the MWD would lose any of the
water it currently receives from the river.</TE>
<TE>   "The water crisis is upon us in many parts of the West," said
Denise Fort, a University of New Mexico law professor who chaired a
presidential commission on Western water policy four years ago.
"There is no unallocated water in the West, with only rare exception.
Water is going to be a limitation to future development."</TE>
<TE>   Western states have boomed, emerging as the fastest-growing
centers in the nation. But the growth occurred during an uncommonly
wet period in the region's history, from the 1970s to the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Fort said that the report on water policy was only the first step
of a comprehensive reform of Western water management, which is
gaining in urgency as populations grow and environmentalists
successfully sue to enforce the Endangered Species Act.</TE>
<TE>   The dire conditions at Elephant Butte Dam are a microcosm of the
multiple pressures building across the West.</TE>
<TE>   The drought has left much of the lake dry and the river has
disappeared into a flat expanse of muck and nonnative salt cedar
trees, an Asian species that consumes large quantities of water. In a
somewhat desperate measure, the Bureau of Reclamation has deployed
four massive floating excavators to dig an 18-mile channel for the
Rio Grande behind the dam.</TE>
<TE>   As matters stand, the reservoir is only holding 15% of its
capacity and users will get only a fraction of their regular
allocations next year.</TE>
<TE>   Two irrigation districts draw on the reservoir and the
fast-growing city of El Paso depends on it for half its supply.
Mexico also is entitled to an allotment under a 1906 treaty.</TE>
<TE>   Every gallon of water that flows into the reservoir in a normal
year is allocated to somebody, meaning that it will take many years
of above-average flow to refill the lake.</TE>
<TE>   But people are not the only demand on remaining water.</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of environmental groups sued the Bureau of Reclamation
this year to force water releases to support the silvery minnow, an
endangered fish below the dam.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge James Parker ruled in favor of the
environmental groups and his decision could have ramifications at
reservoirs nationwide. An appeal was filed and oral arguments will
begin next month.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the suit, the Bureau of Reclamation was forced to
buy water for $100 an acre-foot to support the minnow, said Steve
Hansen, deputy manager of the agency's Albuquerque area office. By
comparison, farmers in the region pay about $50 an acre-foot for
their crops of alfalfa and pecans.</TE>
<TE>   The minnow rescue has cost taxpayers $4.8 million so far, just
another effect of the drought, but unavoidable like all the others.</TE>
<TE>   "What has happened in this basin is just the leading edge of what
the entire West is going to experience," Hansen said. "It is going to
create a new era of learning how to adapt to competing needs. Nobody
has a road map for it. That is being duked out in the courtrooms."</TE>

<TE>   Although many of the major reservoirs west of the 100th meridian
are typically low at this time of year, before it starts to snow in
the mountains, most of the artificial lakes are below their 15-year
averages due to several years of drought in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Precipitation</TE>
<TE>   Decreased precipitation the last few years has resulted in
below-normal dryness through most of the West. Levels are based on

<HD>GOP-Led Senate Won't Be a Pushover for Bush</HD>
<DH>Many of the committee chairmen are mavericks who bring
their own ideas to the table.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Republican takeover of the Senate will provide President Bush
with powerful new allies to push his agenda -- a phalanx of GOP
lawmakers leading the committees where the essential work of shaping
legislation occurs.</LD>
<LD>   But based on their track records, many of these committee chairmen
will not be mere rubber stamps for the administration. The new Senate
barons include a cadre of mavericks and independent thinkers who
bring their own ideas and quirks to the legislative table.</LD>
<LD>   Heading the Appropriations Committee is the wily and combative Ted
Stevens of Alaska, who often pushes for more spending than Bush
wants. The new chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Richard
G. Lugar of Indiana, is an internationalist who has been less than
eager to plunge into war with Iraq. The Commerce Committee's incoming
chairman was Bush's nemesis in the 2000 GOP presidential primary:
John McCain of Arizona.</LD>
<TE>   Once Congress convenes Jan. 7, this lineup could present Bush with
an early leadership challenge: keeping his own party's power brokers
in line.</TE>
<TE>   "If Ted Stevens or John McCain gets his back up, then the
administration is in for a real tough time," said Steve Smith, a
political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Having Republicans at the helm even on their rambunctious days
will be far better for Bush than having Democrats head the Senate
committees. The GOP chairmen will lend muscle to key Bush initiatives
in energy, the environment and defense policy. And whatever their
personal priorities, the chairmen will be under enormous pressure to
toe the administration line. That's because Republican control of the
new Senate resulted, in part, from Bush's barnstorming in this year's
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "For once, you will have a lot of people in the Senate feeling
they do owe him," said Barbara Sinclair, a political science
professor at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the chairmen-in-waiting, such as Stevens and McCain, are
returning to posts they held for the first five months of 2001,
before James M. Jeffords' defection from the GOP gave Democrats the
majority. Others are new in their posts.</TE>
<TE>   Taking charge of the Budget Committee is Don Nickles of Oklahoma,
a fervent believer in cutting taxes and limited government. He is
critical of fiscal decisions Congress has made even when the GOP
controlled both chambers in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "We were spending like crazy," he said. "It's been phenomenal.
It's not sustainable."</TE>
<TE>   His philosophy represents a huge change from that of the panel's
outgoing chairman, Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), who railed against GOP tax
cuts and the toll they took on domestic programs and the budget
deficit. But Nickles also differs from the Republican who served as
chairman or the ranking minority member of the Budget Committee for
the last 22 years: Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico. Less
confrontational in personality, Domenici has been more wary of tax
cuts than many Republicans during times of budget deficits. And as a
member of the Appropriations Committee, he has been more sympathetic
with that panel's chronic pleas for more money.</TE>
<TE>   "Domenici came up in the Senate at a time when it was very
collegial and bipartisan and not very ideological," said Stanley E.
Collender, a federal budget expert with the public relations firm of
Fleishman-Hillard. "For Nickles, the budget has always been a vehicle
to cut taxes."</TE>
<TE>   Domenici is switching jobs to head the Energy and Natural
Resources Committee, where he will be an assist to Bush's
production-oriented energy policy.</TE>
<TE>   The next chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public
Works, James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, is expected to support efforts to
scale back government regulation. Inhofe long has been concerned
about environmental regulations that he believes burden energy
producers and refiners -- important industries in his home state. He
also has urged more stringent cost-benefit analysis of regulations.</TE>
<TE>   That's an abrupt shift in attitude from that of Jeffords, who
after becoming an independent chaired the committee under Democratic
rule.</TE>
<TE>   Inhofe also is seen as more pro-business than the last Republican
chairman of the committee, Bob Smith of New Hampshire. Smith,
defeated in his party's primary earlier this year, sided occasionally
with the environmental lobby. In a prominent break with Bush, Smith
opposed oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</TE>
<TE>   Probably no chairman will be more important to Bush's domestic
agenda than Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who will regain
chairmanship of the Finance Committee. In that post, he is expected
to back Bush's drive to cut taxes.</TE>
<TE>   But Grassley also has a populist streak that could put him at odds
with the administration on other issues. For example, this year he
sponsored a bill opposed by the White House that would have cracked
down on corporations that evade taxes by setting up headquarters in
foreign tax havens, such as Bermuda.</TE>
<TE>   In the early weeks of the new Congress, much attention will be
focused on Stevens and the Appropriations Committee. As the panel's
chairman, he will be a key player as lawmakers work on a slew of
spending bills that remain unfinished for the fiscal year that began
Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Most domestic programs are being funded by a stopgap measure that
provided only short-term funding at previous levels, delaying
expected increases for a raft of agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is pressing hard for Congress to stick to his overall budget
target of $750 billion. Stevens and other Budget Committee members --
Republicans and Democrats alike -- for months had been arguing more
money is needed. The disagreement sparked an open clash between
Stevens and Bush's budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr.</TE>
<TE>   After November's election, Stevens said he will try to stick with
the president's request. But sources close to the committee say any
Bush victory may be only temporary: The panel would likely approve
some spending requests later in the year in a supplemental
appropriation bill.</TE>
<TE>   Next year, Lugar will be a key player in the debate on whether and
when to go to war with Iraq. And some on Capitol Hill believe he may
provide a counterweight to the administration's more bellicose
instincts.</TE>
<TE>   Lugar, a respected foreign policy expert, challenged the
administration during this fall's debate on a resolution authorizing
the use of force against Iraq. With Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr.
(D-Del.), he offered an alternative that would have put more
restraints than the White House wanted on its prerogatives. But under
heavy pressure from the White House, Lugar backed down and voted for
the administration-backed measure.</TE>
<TE>   At the Commerce Committee, McCain will return with a
market-oriented approach to industry regulation that fits well with
Bush's views. But the panel also gives McCain a platform for the
populist issues that often set him at odds with Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Another Republican who has never shied from conflict with the
White House is Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, who will head the
Banking Committee.</TE>
<TE>   As chairman and ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee
in recent years, he has been vocal in his criticism of the country's
intelligence agencies. And on other banking issues, Shelby is more
consumer-oriented than most GOP lawmakers, including retiring Sen.
Phil Gramm of Texas, the last Republican to chair the panel.</TE>
<TE>   Two other key panels will be chaired by Republicans Bush almost
assuredly can count on.</TE>
<TE>   Chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee will transfer from one of
the Senate's leading liberals -- Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont -- to
one of its prominent conservatives -- Orrin G. Hatch of Utah. From
there, Hatch can whisk through Bush's nominees for judgeships who
have been slowed or blocked by Leahy.</TE>
<TE>   As chairman of the Armed Services Committee, John W. Warner of
Virginia will help shape defense policy. He is a friend of the
Pentagon and supporter of Bush's policy on Iraq.</TE>

<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   Our legislative leaders have been boondoggling in Hawaii while
Sacramento bleeds a rapidly widening flow of red ink. Their attention
is urgently needed back home. But let's look at the big picture.</LD>
<LD>   You recall the background:</LD>
<TE>   The prison guards union -- a generous donor of political money
and, in turn, recipient of state government largess -- feted
lawmakers last week at a Maui resort. It was called a "conference" --
political gab in the morning, then golf, the pool ...</TE>
<TE>   Three of the four top leaders -- and several other lawmakers --
fled California's near-bankrupt capital two days after the new
Legislature was sworn in. The trio were Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson
(D-Culver City), Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho
Cucamonga and Assembly GOP Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) had the good
sense to stay home. "I didn't feel like going to Hawaii," he says.
Fact is, Burton is a political workaholic who can't sit still for two
minutes, especially on an island.</TE>
<TE>   But about that big picture:</TE>
<TE>   Union lobbyists and legislators argue that few tax dollars were
spent. In fact, they say, not even union dollars paid for the
lawmakers' travel. They dug into their own pockets (most likely their
political kitties).</TE>
<TE>   Also, they'll tell you, this makes for tight bonding -- these
legislators and lobbyists chatting casually in their Hawaiian shirts
over breadfruit and coconut milk.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, I think we'd all be better off if [Gov. Gray] Davis had
gone along," says political analyst Tony Quinn. "If those people
could deal with Davis in a social atmosphere, they'd get along
better."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, it's noted, there wasn't much action last week in the
Capitol. Lawmakers took the oath Monday. Davis met with leaders
Tuesday. Then it was off to Hawaii. The governor didn't propose his
$10.2-billion package of spending cuts until Friday.</TE>
<TE>   They'll all be back today for the convening of a special budget
session called by the governor.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing illegal about traipsing off to Maui. Just capitalizing on
some perks of office. Schmoozing. Relaxing.</TE>
<TE>   But let's take a closer look at this picture. At the blemishes.</TE>
<TE>   Even if legislators did pay for the travel out of their campaign
accounts, so what? That's money from special interests, including the
26,000-member guards union. The guards gave Wesson $15,000, Brulte
$6,000, Cox $2,000. Now it's legally laundered into boondoggle
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, these indirectly are taxpayer dollars. Where do the
guards get their money to donate? Same place as teachers. The public
purse.</TE>
<TE>   The guards have given Davis about $1.5 million during his first
term and, last winter, won a 37% pay hike spread over five years.
You'd hope that labor contract would be renegotiated, since the state
is facing a deficit of perhaps $30 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeking negotiations with all [employee] units," state
Finance Director Tim Gage said Friday. "We're asking them to
recognize that the state is in a dire financial circumstance."</TE>
<TE>   Wonder whether the guards' lobbyists agreed to any pay rollbacks
during all that bonding with legislative leaders in Hawaii?</TE>
<TE>   It's fair to ask, during this bleak time of certain budget cuts
and probable tax hikes, just how do the disabled in nursing homes and
the middle-class moms worried about their kids' schooling bond with
legislative leaders?</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to have that kind of access," says Pat Leary, lobbyist
for the California State Assn. of Counties, which does not contribute
campaign money. "This is about the fairness of the budget process."</TE>
<TE>   It's another example of why we need public financing of campaigns.
The public, not money-doling special interests, should be buying off
the politicians. That should be the perception and the reality. Now
it's often neither.</TE>
<TE>   "It's understandable why voters are turning out in decreasing
numbers," says Paul Ryan, who pushes campaign reform at the Center
for Governmental Studies. "They perceive their elected officials to
be bought out by large campaign contributors. And they consider their
vote to have little influence on public policy."</TE>
<TE>   More immediately, tropical junkets with money-lubricating
interests hardly instill public confidence in legislators who must
return home and begin whacking the people's services and hiking their
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   But the rationale I find most lame is that, hey, nothing was
happening back at the office. I've got no work to do. Real leaders
generate work and create action.</TE>
<TE>   I'd wondered why the lawmakers didn't stay in session last Monday
and start staunching the red ink. Why wait for the governor? Now we
know.</TE>
<TE>   A lousy start for a new Legislature -- its leaders acting like
undisciplined gluttons who can't keep their hands off a dessert tray.</TE>
<TE>   Frame it anyway they want, this picture just doesn't look good.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Cuts Gas Prices to Regain Sales Lost to U.S.</HD>
<DH>Some Tijuana residents are glad to avoid lines at border
crossings, but others say higher quality fuel is worth the wait.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TIJUANA</DL>
<LD>Business is brisk at the Pemex gas station at Juarez and Madera
streets. The steady stream of cars and taxi drivers rarely lets up,
and attendants wait on customers quickly to keep lines from forming.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Baldomero Gutierrez said sales have increased by 25% in
less than a week, and he is expecting business to keep booming as
word spreads about suddenly lower gas prices.</LD>
<LD>   Attempting to reverse a trend of Mexicans driving over the border
for cheaper American gas, President Vicente Fox lowered prices Dec. 1
at nearly 500 government-owned stations along the border from
California to Texas. In the past, unleaded regular gas at Mexican
pumps cost as much as 60 cents more per gallon than at stations just
over the border in the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   "The most important thing is that we maintain competitiveness on
the northern border," Fox said when he announced the cuts in
Acapulco.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, the government-owned
oil monopoly, said they hope the lower prices on the border will
prevent gas station closures and reduce contraband sales. The
increased business also is expected to help the government, which
gets about a third of its annual revenue from Pemex. Government
officials estimated that Mexicans crossing the border to buy gas in
the United States were costing the country $54 million each year.</TE>
<TE>   The move reflects the increasing power of Mexico's northern state
governors, who pressured Fox into slashing prices and increasing
competition in the border zone, said George W. Grayson, a Mexico
specialist at the College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Grayson said the border-state governors saw the struggling Pemex
stations and knew that it was better to sell gas at lower prices than
lose customers. Now the U.S. stations are the ones bound to lose
business, he said. Some Tijuana residents said they are thankful to
avoid lengthy border crossing lines and buy gas locally. Others,
however, said they plan to continue driving into the United States
for higher quality gas.</TE>
<TE>   Jesus Meza, who manages a Chevron station in San Ysidro, Calif.,
said that he doesn't know what to expect in the future, but that his
customers haven't deserted him yet. "Even if it's the same price,
they tell me the quality is better here," he said. "It's better for
their cars."</TE>
<TE>   Pemex officials insist that their gas is the same quality as that
in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Pemex prices now will be adjusted weekly to match U.S. prices.
Tijuana prices will be in line with those in Chula Vista, Calif.,
while the cost of gas will be the same in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, and
El Paso. Last week, prices for unleaded gas in Tijuana dropped from
about $2.10 per gallon to roughly $1.60.</TE>
<TE>   The change follows a pilot program in Ciudad Juarez, where
government officials said price cuts saved several gas stations from
shutting their doors. In the Mexican state Baja California last week,
sales increased by as much as 40% along the border, said Gov. Eugenio
Elorduy Walther and Pemex officials.</TE>
<TE>   At Gutierrez's Pemex station in Tijuana, Manuel Otero recently
pulled up in his station wagon taxi to buy $15 worth of gas. Otero
said he used to purchase just enough gas in Tijuana to cross the
border into the United States, where he filled up the tank nearly
every day. "But now, with the price the same, why go?" he said,
adding that he wasted at least an hour every time he drove to San
Diego. "I'll leave my money here in Tijuana."</TE>
<TE>   The accountant at another nearby Pemex station, Luis Yanez
Navarro, said the cuts will help Tijuana's economy as a whole by
keeping more consumers in town. "The change should be on a national
level," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone feels that lower prices are enough to persuade
them to buy gas locally. Tijuana university student Pauline Bretts
said she still plans to buy American gas because it lasts longer than
Mexican gas.</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico, "I fill it up, and the same day it's gone," Bretts said
as she filled up the tank of her Nissan Pathfinder on the U.S. side
of the border.</TE>
<TE>   Bretts said it's just as convenient for her to fill up in San
Diego because she frequently shops or sees movies on the U.S. side of
the border. She said she buys gas in Mexico only if she doesn't have
time to make the trip.</TE>
<TE>   At the next pump over, bus driver Antonio Guerrero said he, too,
plans to keep buying gas in the United States because he believes
attendants in Mexico tamper with the pumps. "There are more
guarantees for the client here," he said.</TE>

<HD>Center Opens City's Cultural Lines of Communication</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Los Angeles, a city with one of the world's most diverse
populations, disputes between people from different cultures are
common. Sometimes the disputes are relatively minor, such as
arguments between renters and landlords. Sometimes the disputes turn
into ugly physical confrontations.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a lot of conflict in this city between people of
different languages and different ethnic backgrounds ... and there's
a need for more people to help solve the problems," says Najeeba
Syeed-Miller, executive director of the Asian Pacific American
Dispute Resolution Center. "Our goal is simple: Help people live
together peacefully."</LD>
<LD>   Established in 1989, the downtown center serves mostly the city's
Asian and Pacific Islander population, but also works increasingly to
mediate problems among people from all backgrounds.</LD>
<TE>   The organization has a team of mediators, many of them volunteers,
trained to recognize and honor subtle cultural differences as they
wade into disputes. They work face-to-face with people at the
center's downtown offices and consult by telephone. And they work
with businesses, helping them identify ways to solve racial and
cultural differences.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times it comes down to the simple issue of respect,"
said Syeed-Miller. "One way of solving problems is to teach people
about respecting differences."</TE>
<TE>   Syeed-Miller came to Los Angeles to head the center after
graduating from Indiana University's law school in 2000. She was born
in Kashmir, a region in India long troubled by religious and ethnic
violence.</TE>
<TE>   "I resolved when I was young that I would devote myself to help
build bridges," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Leyva builds bridges, thanks to about 25 hours of training
at the resolution center. The 17-year-old senior at Foshay Learning
Center, a school near USC for kindergarten through 12th grade, is a
key figure in a peer-mediation program that the resolution group runs
on the Foshay campus. Last year, teens like Leyva worked on more than
80 cases at the school, and the program was recognized by the Los
Angeles County Human Relations Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "Before I got into this, I would just sit on the sidelines and
watch people who had problems, afraid of getting involved," said
Leyva, who plans to go to college and become a veterinarian. "Now I
am right in there, bringing people together. It's helped me be more
assertive and given me skills that are going to help me for my whole
life."</TE>
<TE>   The resolution center staff wants to create more programs like the
one at Foshay in other Los Angeles schools, if it can raise enough
money. The group has received a $15,000 grant from the Los Angeles
Times Holiday Campaign, money collected in last year's seasonal
fund-raising effort. Funds raised in the annual Holiday Campaign
benefit charitable agencies throughout Southern California.</TE>

<HD>Hundreds March in Procession for Virgin of Guadalupe Image</HD>
<DH>The ceremony in Echo Park honors the massive replica that
was sent to the Los Angeles Archdiocese from Mexico.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Hernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Her image was on T-shirts, gold pendants and felt banners held high
above the heads of hundreds who paraded through Echo Park on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The procession at Our Lady of Loretto Church honored the Virgin of
Guadalupe, the dark-skinned representation of the Virgin Mary, which
adorns homes and shops -- postmodern murals to key chains -- and many
believe is a staunch defender of the poor and meek.</LD>
<LD>   "To her, there's no racism, no languages. She loves us all," said
55-year-old Alicia Alvarez, who was carrying a print of the Virgin in
a wooden frame so big she barely got her arms on either side of it.
Sweat shone on her brow, and she looked a little fatigued.</LD>
<TE>   "It's worth it," Alvarez said.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez was drawn to this year's procession because of the arrival
of a special "official replica" of the original Virgin of Guadalupe
image that was sent to the Los Angeles archdiocese from Mexico. The
massive replica of Mexico's patron saint was driven through the
streets on the back of a pickup truck.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds carried her image as they sang devotional songs or
recited prayers, serenaded by mariachi bands.</TE>
<TE>   All this week events such as Sunday's procession in Echo Park will
take place throughout the area leading up to Thursday, the Virgin of
Guadalupe's official feast day.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday before sunrise, "guadalupanos" will meet at the former
Cathedral of St. Vibiana downtown for a procession of the image to
the new Our Lady of the Angels Cathedral, where religious groups will
mark its arrival.</TE>
<TE>   There also was a Virgin of Guadalupe procession in downtown Santa
Ana on Sunday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   More parishioners than in previous years are expected to
participate this year because newly canonized St. Juan Diego, who
first saw the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe in 1531, is being
honored today.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a life-giving time," said Father Vicente Lopez of St.
Raphael Church in South- Central Los Angeles, who helped organize the
week's events. "There's music, there's dance, there's church, there's
bishops, there's cardinals -- and there's the virgin."</TE>
<TE>   Reaching out to immigrant Latinos with indigenous roots was a
factor in organizing this year's events, Lopez said. "They welcome
her here because they call her the immigrant virgin, the pilgrim
virgin that walks their walk."</TE>
<TE>   At Sunday's procession, Maria Ortiz, 44, blew kisses and crossed
herself as the massive image came by. Ortiz said the image protected
her son from harm.</TE>
<TE>   "When they shot at one of my sons in front of our house," she
said, "I yelled out, 'Sweet little mother, you are the only one who
can shield him!' And look: Nothing happened to him. Because she is
our shield, and she always will be."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Events</TE>
<TE>   * Monday: St. Juan Diego feast day at Our Lady of the Angels
Cathedral: Mass and performances by indigenous dance and music
groups.</TE>
<TE>   * Tuesday: Aztec "blessing ceremony" and performance of play "La
Virgin de Guadalupe Dios Inantzin" at Cathedral Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   * Wednesday: Vocalist Sergio Almazan and organist Francisco Santos
perform a variety of devotional music in English, Spanish and Latin
at the cathedral.</TE>

procession and Mass led by Cardinal Roger M. Mahony at 5:30 a.m. at

<HD>Letter From Bishops Draws Mixed Reactions</HD>
<DH>Divisions within the Catholic Church are reflected in the
way parishioners take the warnings of more sexual-abuse lawsuits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Wilson and Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Father Martin Benzoni paused uncomfortably midway through his Sunday
Mass at St. John the Baptist Catholic Church.</LD>
<LD>   "You may have read about the letter," he told parishioners at the
Costa Mesa church.</LD>
<LD>   With that, he turned from the day's lesson of St. John wandering
in the desert 2,000 years ago to a letter by the state's 12 bishops
warning of a possible onslaught of costly new sexual-abuse lawsuits
against the church and its clergy.</LD>
<TE>   In cathedrals and parish churches throughout California, many --
but not all -- Catholic priests took to the pulpit to read the
letter, which outlined changes in state law that waive the statute of
limitations on sexual-abuse charges through 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "This law allows people to file lawsuits against dioceses and
California employees based upon claims that rose many decades ago,"
the letter states. "The Catholic Church has been falsely portrayed as
a large corporation with 'deep pockets.' "</TE>
<TE>   Reaction from parishioners was mixed, reflecting deep divisions
within the church.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like the new law," said Darlene Powers, 70, who has
attended St. John's for 20 years. "Every 10-year-old knows to go tell
their parents if someone touched the.... If you're 40, and you were
abused when you were in high school, it's water down the drain."</TE>
<TE>   St. John's is one of many churches across the country caught in
the scandal. A former pastor was placed on paid leave in November
after he was accused in a lawsuit of sexually abusing a boy in the
early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Catherine Hicks of Los Angeles attended church at St. Paul the
Aspostle in Westwood, where the bishops' letter was tucked in the
weekly bulletin but not read aloud. She was unimpressed by concerns
expressed by the bishops that churches could be bankrupted by the new
law.</TE>
<TE>   "So? The church started with nothing, and we can start over with
nothing," Hicks said. "The bad priests should not be protected. I
think the parishioners should be talking about it weekly."</TE>
<TE>   At Ventura's 220-year-old San Buenaventura Mission, Msgr. Patrick
J. O'Brien read the letter at the noon Mass, then moved on to other
matters. Church member Jim Stiffler said he was upset that there was
no further comment, saying it was all too typical of the church's
reaction to abuse allegations from the scandal's outset.</TE>
<TE>   "When he started to read it, it was in such a businesslike
manner," said Stiffler, a manufacturer of aircraft parts who lives in
Oxnard. "There was no compassion to it. I just didn't want to hear
it."</TE>
<TE>   Stiffler said that the state law "won't do any good for the
church" but added that top church officials should be blamed for the
losses any individual parishes might suffer.</TE>
<TE>   "The hierarchy never took care of the problem," he said. "When you
get down to it, they handled it terribly."</TE>
<TE>   At Our Lady of the Assumption in Ventura, parishioner Jim Farley
was highly critical of the law, contending that it's nothing more
than a get-rich-quick scheme for people who see the church as an easy
target.</TE>
<TE>   "Priests who violated children should be prosecuted," said Farley,
a well-known defense attorney and a deacon at his church. "But I
think we're way beyond that now. We're now heavily into the greed
factor."</TE>
<TE>   The law could end up crippling day-to-day operations at some
parishes and would never have been passed if the prime target were a
school district, a government agency or a corporation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   At Holy Family Cathedral in Orange, Jim Watson, 31, a lawyer from
Orange, said he was glad the letter was read.</TE>
<TE>   "The parish is being upfront, aggressive and reassuring, so that
was very helpful," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, members of the national Survivors Network of those Abused
by Priests handed out fliers and a letter from the mother of an
alleged abuse victim. Sherida Ruiz, 54, said she was there to
encourage parishioners to hear both sides of the story and let them
know that it is OK for them to come forward.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz alleged her son, who is now 33, was molested by a priest when
he was 10. She said he is contemplating whether to sue under the new
law.</TE>
<TE>   "This is protecting our children and seeking justice, not fighting
the statute of limitations," Ruiz said of the new law.</TE>
<TE>   After reading the letter at St. John's in Costa Mesa, Father
Benzoni groaned before returning to the day's Gospel readings.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate these things," he said. "But they're important. They're
important."</TE>

<CX>   Accused priest -- An article in Monday's California section about a
letter read in Catholic churches on Sunday incorrectly reported the
date that a former pastor of St. John the Baptist Catholic Church in
Costa Mesa was put on leave after he was accused of molesting a boy
in the 1980s. He was placed on leave in November 2001, not last

<HD>Hospital, Nurses Reach Accord</HD>
<DH>If approved, the pact would be the first for them at Long
Beach Memorial and would increase pay and benefits for 1,300 people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bettina Boxall</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years of tense labor relations and union organizing, one of the
largest privately run hospitals on the West Coast has agreed to a
contract that will increase pay and retirement benefits for 1,300
nurses.</LD>
<LD>   The accord between Long Beach Memorial Medical Center and the
California Nurses Assn. is the first contract for Long Beach Memorial
nurses, who started negotiations with the hospital in February and
staged two one-day strikes this fall.</LD>
<LD>   "It's one of the most important hospitals in California," said
David Johnson, Southern California director of the nurses
association. "Nurses at Long Beach Memorial view this as a
breakthrough that other nurses can emulate."</LD>
<TE>   Johnson said the contract, on which hospital nurses will vote
Tuesday, creates a step salary system that ties pay to experience,
calls for guaranteed employer contributions to the nurses' retirement
plan and sets up a process to resolve staffing disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital spokesman Brian Greene said the administration would not
release details of the agreement before the nursing staff had been
informed of it. In a statement, hospital Chief Executive Byron
Schweigert said: "We're pleased that we have reached an agreement for
a three-year contract with the CNA bargaining team. Both sides have
agreed on nursing salaries as well as a defined contribution plan
that will benefit our nurses in their retirement."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said the average wage increase for nurses will total 21%
over the life of the contract. The old profit-sharing retirement
plan, in which hospital contributions varied depending on the
institution's finances, will be replaced by guaranteed annual
contributions ranging from 4% to 9% of salary. And unresolved
disputes over staffing levels will be referred to arbitration,
Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   The contract settlement is part of a push to unionize hospital
nurses in Southern California, where most registered nurses have not
belonged to a union. One of five hospitals run by Memorial Health
Services, Long Beach Memorial has 741 beds and, after Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, is the second largest privately operated hospital in
the West. The agreement comes just days before nurses at Cedars-Sinai
are scheduled to vote on whether to join the union.</TE>

<HD>How to Wash 11,000 Panes? Ingeniously</HD>
<DH>For Garden Grove's Crystal Cathedral, a company's solution
is design and sweat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Haldane</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Randall Edwards wants to see some identification.</LD>
<LD>   You can't be too careful these days, says the manager of Mr. Crane
Inc. -- he could inadvertently be talking to a spy from the
competition.</LD>
<LD>   Other crane companies have tried to lure away its high-profile
customer, Garden Grove's Crystal Cathedral, Edwards insists.</LD>
<TE>   But a spokesman for the cathedral says that's not likely to
happen. Mr. Crane has provided the resounding answer to a longtime
prayer for the 3.5-million-cubic-foot church, home to the weekly
"Hour of Power" broadcasts to millions worldwide and now presenting
its elaborate annual "Glory of Christmas" pageant.</TE>
<TE>   The question posed by the prayer: How to wash the estimated 11,000
windows from which the cathedral derives its name? The answer: Lots
of elbow grease. Oh, yes, and a huge crane with a brush-equipped
basket designed specifically for the purpose.</TE>
<TE>   "We designed it, we built it, and only we know how to operate it,"
Edwards assures his now-clearly identified visitor from the press.
That expertise is exercised for three grueling weeks each August.</TE>
<TE>   "Being 260 feet up in a basket, you can see a long way," says
Edwards, 46, whose company is based in Orange. "When we're over there
washing, we get lots of attention."</TE>
<TE>   The prayer at issue was first uttered in 1988 after three
cathedral employees -- hoisted aloft by a rented crane -- spent two
months painstakingly washing each glass pane with a paper towel
dipped in Windex.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so expensive," Edwards recalls, "that they had to find
another way. A guy appeared in our office and asked if we could
figure out a better way to wash the windows. An employee sat down,
thought about it and started coming up with ideas from his head,
which he chalked on the floor."</TE>
<TE>   It took former employee Ron Lytel about a month to draw up a plan.
The problem, in addition to the sheer number of windows involved, was
the slope of the cathedral and its lack of footholds -- all of which
made access almost impossible. So Lytel designed a basket that could
hang from a 175-ton hydraulic crane.</TE>
<TE>   Weighing about 2,000 pounds, the 4-by-10-foot metal basket --
owned by Crystal Cathedral and stored there -- carries five workers
aloft. Water mixed with industrial-strength ammonia is supplied from
a diesel pump below to several long, rotating brushes on the basket's
bottom and side. As the crane guides the basket's brushes along the
building's glass roof and walls, designers say, the men in the basket
hit the tough spots by hand.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to wear a full mask, because the stuff is lethal," says
Edward Quiroga, the cathedral's 49-year-old head rigger, who, as part
of his responsibility for maintaining everything above ground level,
oversees the annual washing of the windows.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to tell my friends that I don't do windows," says the rock
musician-turned-electrical engineer, "but I guess I can't say that
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The task is performed in three steps. First, the basket crew tests
each pane with tiny suction cups to identify those needing repair.
Windows that come loose -- usually about 500 a year -- are
immediately caulked and resealed. Second, the washing is done.
Finally, all leaks are repaired.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hot up there in August," he says. "With the reflection off
that glass, there's nowhere to run and nowhere to hide. It requires
strong protective glasses and lots of Gatorade."</TE>
<TE>   But the job also has its charm. "There's a real sense that you're
doing something special and unique," Quiroga says. "You're more than
200 feet in the air and you look around and the world is going about
its business, but there are five guys up in that basket experiencing
something different."</TE>
<TE>   The real satisfaction, though, comes when the task is completed.
"For the first couple of weeks," he says, "it's breathtaking, truly
awesome. Everyone is elated to see the cathedral clean. I get a lot
of compliments and feel a sense of achievement."</TE>
<TE>   Then reality sets in.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot tell a lie," Quiroga reports: "It doesn't take but a
month or six weeks before the windows need cleaning again."</TE>
<TE>   Church officials have considered washing them more often, he says,
but the job costs $85,000 a crack.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frustrating," says the window washer who's really an
electrical engineer. Shading his eyes with a cupped hand, Quiroga
surveys the sparkling glass mountain of a building on a November
afternoon. "It doesn't look as bad as it will in eight months," he
announces finally, "but I can see the dirt already."</TE>

<HD>Stars Shine on Theater Troupe</HD>
<DH>Ventura's 5-year-old Rubicon company has benefited from,
among other things, its founders' friendships with celebrities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josef Woodard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It started out with a budget of zero, high hopes and the help of
friends like Ted Neely and Carl Anderson, stars of the original
"Jesus Christ Superstar."</LD>
<LD>   Five years and 100,000 tickets later, the Rubicon Theatre Company
boasts a budget of $1.6 million, visiting celebrities and a permanent
home in downtown Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   That's quite a feat for a 207-seat company for which ticket sales
account for only a third of the budget.</LD>
<TE>   Sitting in her third-story office in the Laurel Theatre, with
views of Ventura and the ocean beyond, Karyl Lynn Burns is surrounded
by boxes of paperwork, posters, photographs and other reminders of
productions past.</TE>
<TE>   Burns, who founded and runs the group along with her husband,
James O'Neill, describes her mission: "Indigenous theater, which has
a tight relationship with the community, is really my soapbox."</TE>
<TE>   That local connection has been bolstered by celebrity glitter. The
troupe was launched with a reprise of "Jesus Christ Superstar"
featuring Neely and Anderson. Stephanie Zimbalist has appeared in
both runs of "The Rainmaker," and Linda Purl starred in "The Little
Foxes." More recently, John Ritter was in the world premiere of Jenny
Sullivan's autobiographical "J for J," and last season also featured
the likes of Joe Spano and Harold Gould.</TE>
<TE>   This past weekend, Stacy Keach was part of a fund-raiser at a
private home. And Tuesday, celebrated actors Robert Morse and Susan
Clark will perform, for one night only, Truman Capote's "A Christmas
Memory." It will be taped by Gold Coast Broadcasting for airing
during the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   Currently running is "Forever Plaid," an easy-does-it musical for
the holidays. The fifth season will also feature the more substantial
"A Streetcar Named Desire," starring Purl, and "Art," with Richard
Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill spoke on the phone recently from New York City, where he
was holding auditions for the coming season.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of the artists who come to work really like
[Ventura]," he said. "They appreciate the hometown atmosphere, the
hospitality, the weather, the beach and the whole ambience.... At the
same time, they appreciate the commitment to quality we hope we
have."</TE>
<TE>   The group began in 1998 with Burns and O'Neill's desire to fill a
void. "There was a lot of good community theater here, but there had
not been a professional theater company in Ventura's 150-year
history," Burns said. Professional companies use Equity Union actors
and usually pay higher salaries.</TE>
<TE>   Burns had been an actress, publicist and executive director of the
Ventura Chamber Music Festival for several years. O'Neill was in the
touring production of "Jesus Christ Superstar" as Pontius Pilate.</TE>
<TE>   After "Superstar," staged in late 1998 at the Ventura Theatre, the
company put on "Darrow" in the county courthouse and "Romeo and
Juliet" at the Bella Maggiore Inn in downtown Ventura, before taking
the play into the schools as part of an outreach program.</TE>
<TE>   They had planned to do "Shirley Valentine," featuring Burns
herself, in someone's kitchen. Suddenly, though, the search for a
permanent home ended. Doug Halter and Joe Murray decided to buy a
historic church and turn it into a theater. They extended an
invitation to the then-itinerant Rubicon. As a result, Burns says,
"Someone's kitchen was spared."</TE>
<TE>   The Laurel, she says, has "been the ideal place for us to incubate
and grow and develop an audience. We never would have made it in a
bigger house. Doug and Joe have made this enormous commitment to
making the building work, so we've been able to focus on the
programming."</TE>
<TE>   A tour of the building, built in the 1920s, reveals a bustling
compound mostly taken up by the Rubicon, along with other groups,
including the Ventura County Master Chorale.</TE>
<TE>   In one stairwell are posters from every production thus far. In
the lobby are autographed glossies of assorted actors, including Jack
Lemmon, Steve Allen, Larry Hagman and Amanda McBroom.</TE>
<TE>   Burns remembers Lemmon's role in a last-minute presentation of
"Love Letters" early in 2000, which helped to "cement in people's
minds that we intended to be professional. We were probably at a
stage where our vision outstripped our resources, but maybe they
could see the potential if they supported it."</TE>
<TE>   Locally, the Rubicon has become a magnet for staff and volunteer
forces. Down in the basement are Dotty Novatt and Shari Wolfe,
president and vice president of the Grand Dames, a 300-member
volunteer squad. "It's very satisfying to be involved with this,"
Novatt said. "It's a great group of people."</TE>
<TE>   The operation has grown to include more and more staff, including
a production manager and graphic designer, jobs done by O'Neill and
Burns until recently.</TE>
<TE>   Burns and O'Neill literally met onstage while playing villains in
"Man of La Mancha" in the mid-1980s. O'Neill has continued to do
occasional acting via the company, as in last year's production of
George Bernard Shaw's "The Devil's Disciple." Burns put acting on a
back burner for a time to take on behind-the-scenes duties and
logistical wrangling.</TE>
<TE>   "I stopped after 'The Little Foxes,' " she said, "because I had a
moment on stage when I was thinking about whether or not I sent out
enough [funding] proposals that week. I love it too much not to be
entirely present when I'm doing it. I made a pact with the board to
take a couple of years to just work on this side of it."</TE>
<TE>   Burns is coming back to the stage occasionally now and will
perform with O'Neill in "Dancing at Lughnasa," opening Feb. 26.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so invigorating to be part of the process from all sides,"
Burns says. "But there's a little part of me that feels a little
squelched. I need to [act] every so often so I remember what it's
about."</TE>
<TE>   One goal the founders share, funds permitting, is opening a second
venue.</TE>
<TE>   "It would serve a lot of purposes," O'Neill said. "In one venue,
you might end up doing things that are more mainstream, popular
things that keep the company going. In the other, smaller venue, you
might end up doing things that are more challenging and looking to
the future."</TE>
<TE>   But even while looking to the future, O'Neill is quick to point
out that he's grateful for the present.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really encouraged that people are getting it, getting what
it's going to take and the process of how we're going to get there,"
he said. "They really want it, as they've shown, not only by showing
up but by putting their money where their mouth is.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a pretty quick rise, by any account."</TE>

<HD>Scooter Rolls Into a Political Tempest</HD>
<DH>After San Francisco city supervisors ban Segways from
sidewalks, Mayor Brown promises a veto.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris O'Connell</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>When inventor Dean Kamen rolled out his much anticipated two-wheeled
creation dubbed the Segway Human Transporter late last year, he
predicted the device could be the answer to urban ills from pollution
to traffic congestion.</LD>
<LD>   The electrically powered vehicle, which resembles a rotary
lawnmower, moves at speeds of up to 12.5 mph, and Kamen hoped it
would replace the car as the vehicle of choice for short trips of
less than five miles.</LD>
<LD>   What Kamen failed to foresee was how some people in San Francisco
-- a city known for walkers -- would react to the idea of sharing
their sidewalks.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't care if it's gyroscopes or what it is," Jeanne Lynch said
of the technology that enables the vehicle to move almost as a
seamless extension of the human body. "You just get some clown on
their Segway to speed it up and the people on our sidewalks are going
to be victims."</TE>
<TE>   Lynch, 73, is a member of Senior Action Network, a group that
represents 25,000 seniors in San Francisco and lobbied to keep
Segways off the city's sidewalks. Seniors and disabled people in
particular, Lynch said, are afraid of being knocked over by the
virtually silent vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Their efforts were successful. On Nov. 25, San Francisco became
the first municipality in the nation to impose a ban on the vehicles
when city supervisors voted 8 to 2 to keep them off sidewalks, out of
public transit stations, and off buses and trains. They are allowed
on city streets.</TE>
<TE>   But the fight isn't over yet. Mayor Willie Brown has said he
intends to veto the ordinance, and a new state law permitting Segways
on sidewalks means that each city and town in California can decide
how to regulate the vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Although it was introduced late last year, consumer models just
went on sale in November on Amazon.com for $4,950, with an expected
delivery date of March. So far, 32 states have enacted legislation
allowing Segways on streets and sidewalks, but none has passed an
outright ban.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation classifying
Segways as "electric personal assistive mobility devices," thus
allowing them on sidewalks throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   Almost as soon as Davis signed the bill, San Francisco Supervisor
Chris Daly, with encouragement from Senior Action Network and walking
and bicycling enthusiasts, introduced the anti-Segway ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   Daly, who rode a Segway when a lobbyist visited his office and
called the technology behind it "great," said sidewalks in San
Francisco are already too crowded. "We're the densest city in
California, we have a large disability community, and we have
competition for space on our sidewalks," Daly said.</TE>
<TE>   P.J. Johnston, a spokesman for Mayor Brown, countered that a ban
on the Segway is premature. "The concerns about pedestrian safety are
legitimate and ought to be discussed, and perhaps the city will seek
restrictions of some form," Johnston said. "But banning something
before it's been tested or put into play is poor public policy, to
say the least."</TE>
<TE>   Technology and business advocates have called the ban shortsighted
and bad for business.</TE>
<TE>   "The Segway can hopefully improve mobility and decrease
congestion," said Steven Gottlieb, a spokesman for the Bay Area
Committee, a public policy organization for 250 chief executives.
"The Board of Supervisors is a little out of sync with innovation."</TE>
<TE>   Matt Dalida, director of state government affairs for New
Hampshire-based Segway LLC, said the company was hoping that
technology-savvy San Franciscans would be among the company's first
customers.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we're disappointed. The action is premature," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Citing more than 50,000 hours of tests conducted on the sidewalks
of various cities -- including Boston, Chicago, Seattle and a trial
run by the U.S. Postal Service in San Francisco -- without a
pedestrian injured, Dalida said that supervisors and pedestrian
advocates overreacted.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Livingston, executive director of Senior Action Network,
dismissed those safety claims. "A new form of pedestrian injury will
take place," he said, "and it will be called 'pedestrian injury by
Segway.' "</TE>

<HD>UCI's Hospital Aims to Move Up-Market</HD>
<DH>Medical center touts its quality in ad campaign while
seeking donors for a new facility. Its care for the poor has been cut
back in recent months.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Gottlieb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jaw set, legs bent and torso twisted in full swing, Anaheim Angels
third baseman Troy Glaus adorns the cover of Sports Illustrated's
special issue commemorating the team's World Series victory. On the
back is another familiar name in Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   "The Best hospital congratulates the Best team," the full-page
color ad says. "UCI Medical Center is as unique to Orange County as
the Angels are."</LD>
<LD>   The $15,000 ad is the latest sign of UCI Medical Center's
revved-up campaign to transform its image as the county's hospital
for the poor into that of an innovative health-care center rivaling
the best in the nation.</LD>
<TE>   UCI is not just fighting for patients with the best hospitals in
Orange County, like Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport
Beach, but with top-flight Los Angeles-area medical centers such as
UCLA and Cedars-Sinai, and even the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the medical center is cutting back on care for
the poor, and those beds are being filled by paying patients lured by
the ads in newspapers, magazines and radio highlighting the
hospital's specialists and state-of-the-art equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The ad campaign also has a deeper purpose: to help attract the
attention of potential donors. To meet state earthquake safety
requirements, UCI is planning a $370-million hospital, which
officials there hope will cap its image turnaround. Bonds and other
sources are expected to pay for most of the construction, but UCI
expects to have to raise about $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to let the community know about the facility, and the
visibility [from advertising] can't hurt," said Dr. Ralph Cygan, the
center's chief executive. "We're also trying to tell the
philanthropic community in Orange County it's not a project that
benefits just the university but is a unique resource for the entire
community."</TE>
<TE>   Themed Ads</TE>
<TE>   Advertising is not new to the medical center. But this campaign,
which began in May, marks the hospital's most concerted effort with
themed advertising spotlighting UCI's excellence.</TE>
<TE>   One ad touted UCI for having the county's only robotic-assisted
surgery machine. Another announced, "We're making cancer more
treatable." Still another bragged that the medical center was the
only hospital in the county that U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked
among the nation's best, landing 29th in gynecology and 43rd in
treating kidney disease.</TE>
<TE>   When the Web site www.bestdoctors.com listed 40 UCI physicians,
they became the focus of another ad. The same thing happened when a
coalition of mainly Fortune 500 benefit managers called UCI the
safest hospital in California.</TE>
<TE>   Cygan said the new emphasis came about because community and
business leaders, many of them on panels that advise the medical
center or help it raise money, were telling hospital officials they
were doing a poor job of telling its story. The ads are aimed not
only at prospective patients but at doctors who might then be more
likely to make referrals to UCI.</TE>
<TE>   "People haven't associated this facility with high-quality
university health care," Cygan said.</TE>
<TE>   The new campaign targets families likely to have health insurance
that will pay the bills. The ads have appeared in local newspapers
and editions of Time, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated and U.S. News that
are delivered to Orange County's wealthiest ZIP Codes, said Susan
Rayburn, the medical center's vice president of external affairs.</TE>
<TE>   UCI officials would not say exactly how much money they are
spending on advertising. Cygan said the center's $3-million annual
marketing budget has dropped slightly, but a greater proportion now
is devoted to advertising.</TE>
<TE>   UCI is by no means the only area hospital to advertise, especially
around the fall and spring, when businesses allow employees to change
health plans.</TE>
<TE>   Debra Legan, vice president of marketing for Hoag, said the
hospital's ad campaigns result in more phone calls and referrals. The
most successful ads, she said, are those that run on the sides of
buses.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make sure when people are diagnosed with something,
we're on the top of their mind," Legan said. "If someone is told they
have cancer, we want them to know there's a cancer center at Hoag
hospital, and they should check it out."</TE>
<TE>   Competitive Medicine</TE>
<TE>   Hospital advertising was low-key until the mid-1980s. But as
managed care and Medicare changes made health care more competitive,
hospitals began to advertise much more frequently, said Rick Wade,
senior vice president of the American Hospital Assn. in Washington,
D.C. He said that because some units lose money, hospitals must
attract patients for treatments that bring profits.</TE>
<TE>   UCI officials say they are determined to erase the image of the
medical center as the county hospital; it stopped fulfilling that
role after UC Irvine bought it 26 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Four months ago, UCI began cutting back the number of people it
treats under the county's Medical Services for the Indigent program,
which provides care for people age 21 through 64 who earn too much to
qualify for Medi-Cal but aren't old enough for Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   The care is limited to services that protect life or prevent a
significant disability or serious deterioration of health.</TE>
<TE>   Cygan said other Orange County hospitals were not taking in their
share of these patients, that it was costing the medical center too
much money to subsidize them, and that UCI was jammed with too many
poor patients to serve anyone properly or to meet the university
hospital's teaching and research missions.</TE>
<TE>   Despite caring for those from the indigent program and other poor
patients, UCI Medical Center made $30 million last year, Rayburn
said. Much of those profits were funneled to the medical school for
teaching and research.</TE>
<TE>   Rayburn said the heightened advertising campaign was necessary
because research showed that when people were asked to name the
county's best hospitals, they mentioned Hoag and St. Joseph instead
of UCI.</TE>
<TE>   "We had everybody familiar with the academic part of UCI, and that
we were near The Block at Orange," said Pam Rimar, the medical
center's marketing services manager.</TE>
<TE>   Message to Doctors</TE>
<TE>   The medical center is staffed with 300 doctors on faculty at the
UCI College of Medicine. Dr. Thomas Cesario, dean of the medical
school, said the campaigns help recruit clinical professors who rely
on their practices for much of their income.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to get them here unless we get them access to patients,
and this shows them we will get them access to patients," Cesario
said of the ads.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the doctors themselves are the focus of ads, such as a
recent one on Ralph Clayman, chairman of the department of urology.</TE>
<TE>   He invented a technique that allows surgeons to remove a kidney
using two fingertip-sized incisions, reducing pain and complications
and dramatically improving recovery time. Another spotlighted Dr.
Kenneth Chang, and his technique of using an endoscope and ultrasound
to diagnose gastrointestinal cancer without surgery.</TE>
<TE>   UCI is working on a new ad campaign expected to debut in February.
Along with a "best doctors and best hospitals" ad, they will push
specific hospital programs, Rayburn said, such as a new geriatric
center or a comprehensive digestive disease center, the first in
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "We want people to think of us as more than the place the
ambulance takes them when they get really sick," Rayburn said.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Police Investigating 4 Stabbings</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oxnard police on Sunday were investigating a series of fights that
left four Oxnard residents with stab wounds and two others with minor
injuries.</LD>
<LD>   A number of the men attended a party in the 2900 block of Sturgis
Road, police said. Fights erupted over several hours after the party
broke up about 3 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   Suffering multiple stab wounds were Samuel Avila, 25; Omar Jasso,
23; Aaron Flores, 23; and Luis Lomelli, 21. None of the injuries were
listed as life-threatening.</LD>
<TE>   The other men injured were Jonathon Whiting, 22, and Joseph
Chavez, 22. They told police they had been assaulted in the vicinity
of San Jose and Kohala streets. It was not immediately clear whether
those incidents were linked to the stabbings.</TE>
<TE>   Officers interviewed victims at St. John's Regional Medical Center
in Oxnard and Community Memorial Hospital and Ventura County Medical
Center in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Police, who are seeking additional witnesses, said the incidents
may be gang-related.</TE>

<HD>Orange Bowl Had Juice, so Rose Bowl Gets Pulp</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Rose Bowl got its dream matchup Sunday, Iowa vs. USC, featuring
possibly the top two finishers in this week's Heisman Trophy
balloting -- quarterbacks Brad Banks and Carson Palmer.</LD>
<LD>   Too bad this terrific Rose Bowl game is going to be played in the
Orange Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   The good news is the Orange Bowl, far as we know, did not insist
the Rose Parade be moved from Pasadena to South Beach. This will come
as a big relief to Bob Eubanks.</LD>
<TE>   And to the many absurdities of the bowl championship series, add
this one: Had UCLA defeated Washington State on Saturday, and not the
other way around, the Rose Bowl would have been USC versus Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks again, Bob Toledo.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Orange Bowl played the BCS rule book like a fiddle,
exercised every clause and loophole known to Perry Mason and ended up
with the best bowl game of the bunch -- yeah, maybe even better than
No. 1 Miami vs. No. 2 Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl gets a very good game pitting two-loss, top-10
teams, Washington State and Oklahoma -- a game the Holiday Bowl would
die for.</TE>
<TE>   When you look at it, really, the Rose Bowl only missed its
traditional matchup by two digits: Big 12 minus two equals Big Ten,
right?</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl hoped this USC-Iowa matchup would not happen,
thought it would not happen, prayed it would not happen, yet in the
end grossly underestimated the self-serving, money-driven,
perfectly-within-its-rights interests of the Orange Bowl against the
long-term best interests of the BCS.</TE>
<TE>   Having USC-Iowa in the Orange Bowl put the Rose Bowl in a bad
public relations spot, but in the end, money trumped tradition.</TE>
<TE>   USC vs. Iowa is a five-star game for the Orange Bowl, and that's
all that mattered to the Orange Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   You wonder what Jim Murray, the late, great Times columnist, would
have written of this development. With due respect, we offer our best
guess.</TE>
<TE>   Having Iowa and USC play in the Orange Bowl is like having the
Christians and lions face off in a parking lot. It's like making
Horowitz play the accordion, Pavarotti singing lead in a barbershop
quartet.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Rose Bowl hard-liners who never wanted to join the BCS in
the first place are probably being coaxed down from the tallest Rose
Parade floats.</TE>
<TE>   Wasn't last year sinful enough, when the Rose Bowl was moved to
Thursday night, two days after the parade?</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, instead of No. 1 Miami against No. 2 Oregon, the
computer geeks handed the Rose Bowl lucky-to-be-there Nebraska, which
was promptly corn-fed to Miami in a game that was over by halftime.</TE>
<TE>   And now this?</TE>
<TE>   Instead of the Lawry's Beef Bowl, are Iowa and USC are going to
stage a stone crab-eating contest at Joe's?</TE>
<TE>   Mind you, the BCS is sensitive to the Rose Bowl's plight.</TE>
<TE>   "If I said it wasn't an issue, I'd be lying," BCS Coordinator
Michael Tranghese said Sunday. "I think all of us in dealing with the
Rose Bowl probably don't have as much appreciation for what they have
been through. It's hard enough for them not to have Iowa and I think
they were expecting Iowa and Southern Cal in different bowl games.
And I think for the longest time this week we were headed in that
direction."</TE>
<TE>   Directions changed and, tradition be damned, the Orange Bowl did
what was best for the Orange Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   In this brave new BCS world, you cut the best deal you can and run
for cover.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl put on its best face Sunday in welcoming outsider
Oklahoma to its game. For what it's worth, Sooner Coach Bob Stoops
was a no-show on the conference call.</TE>
<TE>   Gee, didn't he know this was the Rose Bowl? Coach Mike Price of
Washington State, the legitimate Rose Bowl anchor as Pac-10 champion,
tried his best to put the best spin on it.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to be kidding me," he said of the debate over this
year's game. "This is a great game."</TE>
<TE>   In a way, Price is right. This could have been a Washington
State-Colorado Rose Bowl had Oklahoma not won Saturday night's Big 12
title game.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the broader issue will not, and should not, go away.</TE>
<TE>   What the Rose Bowl needs to do in the off-season is march into BCS
headquarters and demand the same protection for its brand that Notre
Dame got from the BCS for simply being Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, at this moment, Notre Dame lawyers probably are drafting
a clause in which all 10-2 Notre Dame teams that lose to USC by 31
points be granted an automatic BCS bid.</TE>
<TE>   Since the BCS is already filled with a thousand provisions, what's
one more going to hurt?</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl ought to get out a legal pad and get the BCS to sign
off on a clause in which the Rose Bowl can never lose both Big Ten
co-champions in years it doesn't have the national title game.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Rose Bowl might get an earful about BCS chips
falling where they may from Tranghese, the BCS chief and Big East
commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Virginia Tech was left out of the BCS mix despite going
10-1 with quarterback Michael Vick.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't get a lot of sympathy then," Tranghese said. "I didn't
get much support from anybody, to be perfectly blunt about it. I
reminded everybody, 'Don't cry to me in 2002.' The system has never
been perfect. I make no bones about that."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Tranghese acknowledged the Rose Bowl issue needs to be
addressed because, "for the overall good of college football, I'm
concerned."</TE>
<TE>   As for talk about the Rose Bowl leaving the BCS, we ask, leave it
for what?</TE>
<TE>   One of the problems is that the Rose Bowl is at philosophical odds
with its partners.</TE>
<TE>   While the Rose Bowl was bemoaning its fate Sunday, commissioners
Tom Hansen and Jim Delaney of the Pac-10 and Big Ten were in the
corner counting the $18 million each conference will split for
putting two schools into the BCS.</TE>
<TE>   What's the problem?</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl can't pull out of the BCS without the Pac-10 or Big
Ten, unless it wants to forge a new East-West partnership with the
Mountain West and Conference USA.</TE>
<TE>   No, the Rose Bowl is stuck in this BCS muck, for better or worse,
mostly worse.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing it can do now is roll up its sleeves and play
hardball.</TE>
<TE>   For 55 years, the Granddaddy had no decision to make when it came
to the participants. It simply waited for the Pac-10 and Big Ten
champions to be crowned and then handed out roses.</TE>
<TE>   But, you know, there may come a year down the road when the Rose
and Orange bowls end up submitting pieces of paper for the same
at-large pick.</TE>
<TE>   Let's say that at-large pick is Miami, and the Orange Bowl really
wants the Hurricanes.</TE>
<TE>   And let's say the Rose Bowl, using its one-time preferential pick,
wants Miami too.</TE>
<TE>   While the Rose Bowl would sympathize with the Orange Bowl's desire
to keep Miami at home, it takes Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing personal, you know, just business.</TE>

takes Oklahoma.</DH>

<LD>USC is going to South Florida to play Iowa instead of New Orleans to
play Georgia because of a bit of trickery the Orange Bowl pulled out
of the bowl championship series playbook.</LD>
<LD>   Perfectly legal, mind you, a variation of the old end-around.</LD>
<LD>   Taking advantage of a one-time option provision in the BCS
contract, the Orange Bowl was able to trump the Sugar Bowl's bid and
match No. 5 USC against No. 3 Iowa in Miami on Jan. 2, bringing a
merciful end to one of the most bizarre weeks in the history of bowl
bidding.</LD>
<TE>   Up until Oklahoma defeated Colorado in the Big 12 championship
game Saturday night, it appeared USC was headed to the Sugar Bowl to
play Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   But the Orange Bowl switched gears and took USC to play against
Iowa in a matchup that, for about 55 years, would have made a
mouth-watering Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl lobbied against pairing the co-champions of the
Pacific 10 and Big Ten conferences in the Orange Bowl, but had no
legal recourse to stop the move.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned a lot about the BCS this year and the way it
operates," Rose Bowl Chief Executive Mitch Dorger said Sunday. "We
did not anticipate all the subtleties of the system. Everything was
conducted this year in accordance with the rules."</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl understood that, as perceptions go, an Iowa-USC game
in the Orange Bowl simply did not look good.</TE>
<TE>   There were even questions Sunday as to whether the Rose Bowl, out
of frustration, might pull out of the BCS when the contract expires
after the 2005 season, but Dorger gave no indication that would
happen.</TE>
<TE>   "We are committed in the BCS system," he said. "We have no
position with regard of where we might go or if any changes are
needed or not."</TE>
<TE>   When asked if he was worried about whether the Rose Bowl might
pull out, BCS Coordinator Michael Tranghese was emphatic.</TE>
<TE>   "No, absolutely not," he said. "I think we've invested a great
deal into this. I think at the end of the day, measuring everything
it's done, the high side clearly outweighs the down side."</TE>
<TE>   When the Orange Bowl made its final chess move, the fractious BCS
bowl picture was at last finalized.</TE>
<TE>   Miami (12-0) and Ohio State (13-0), which finished first and
second in the BCS standings, will play in the Jan. 3 Fiesta Bowl for
the undisputed national title.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl will pair Pac-10 co-champion Washington State (10-2)
against Big 12 champion Oklahoma (11-2), while the Sugar Bowl will
play host to Florida State (9-4) and Georgia (12-1), champions of the
Atlantic Coast and Southeastern conferences.</TE>
<TE>   The irony is that for all the confusion and controversy
surrounding this year's BCS, the system will pair the nation's two
undefeated schools in a title game that could not have been made
under the old format.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll remind everybody," Tranghese said, "that eight years ago you
could have not brought together Ohio State and Miami. Ohio State
would have been in Rose Bowl and Miami would have been in the Orange
Bowl and everybody would have been clamoring for it. They would have
said, 'look at the stupidity of this system.'</TE>
<TE>   "And now we bring them together and now everyone wants to focus on
everything else except the fact two teams, No. 1 and No. 2 and
undefeated, are going to get a chance to play."</TE>
<TE>   The problem with the BCS this year was the three major bowls not
participating in the national title game.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl agreed to join the BCS in 1998 knowing it could lose
its traditional Pac-10/Big Ten pairing even in seasons when it was
not hosting the national title game, but that realization hit hard
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did the Rose Bowl lose Iowa (11-1) to the Orange Bowl, it
then had to watch as the Orange Bowl used a legal maneuver to take
USC (10-2).</TE>
<TE>   "We were familiar with all the rules," Dorger said. "What I think
came to light for us was the way in which those rules can create more
permutations and combinations than we previously anticipated."</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl wasn't the only big player befuddled. Notre Dame,
which at 10-2 thought it had a good shot at receiving a BCS bowl bid,
ended up in the Gator Bowl, roughly a $12-million pay cut.</TE>
<TE>   So how did the Orange Bowl get USC?</TE>
<TE>   Among myriad rules in the BCS contract is one that allows a bowl
with a higher payout to jump order in the selection process.</TE>
<TE>   How it works: With Miami and Ohio State lost to the Fiesta Bowl,
the Orange Bowl got the first pick and took Iowa. The Rose Bowl,
selecting second and wanting to avoid a Washington State-USC rematch,
selected 11-2 Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   That left USC -- guaranteed an at-large berth in one of the four
BCS bowls because of its No. 4 finish in the BCS rankings -- and
Florida State to fill the last two spots.</TE>
<TE>   The Sugar and Orange bowls both submitted on paper the schools
they wanted in order of preference. Both bowls selected USC first. In
accordance with BCS rules, the Orange Bowl exercised what is called a
preferential pick, earning the one-time right to take USC.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange Bowl earned this right by paying roughly $200,000 more
a season, $900,000 over the life of the BCS contact, than the Sugar
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "Our board labored with the decision," Orange Bowl Chief Executive
Keith Tribble said.</TE>
<TE>   Tribble had to know the decision would not please the Rose Bowl,
yet he saw this as a one-time opportunity to get a premier matchup
and much better than the alternative -- Iowa vs. four-loss Florida
State.</TE>
<TE>   Tribble said the USC option "probably became more into focus after
the games of Saturday materialized." He said he was sensitive to the
Rose Bowl's concerns but ultimately had to make the best deal for his
bowl under the rules.</TE>

<HD>Iowa Fans Find Bowl Issue a Bit Thorny</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Houston Mitchell</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The people in charge of the Orange Bowl have made no friends in Iowa
by selecting the Hawkeyes to play USC on Jan. 2, preventing an
Iowa-Washington State matchup in the Rose Bowl. A quick check of "The
Hawks Nest," an Internet bulletin board devoted to the Hawkeyes,
finds many irate fans, some of whom suggest the Orange Bowl committee
do some things that are probably anatomically impossible. A look at
the tamer comments:</LD>
<LD>   From regalhawk: "Guess I won't be looking out from inside the Rose
Bowl seeing the sunset over the San Gabriel Mountains as I had hoped.
$270 down the drain. Did the Orange Bowl even take into consideration
all the Iowa fans who would be unable to change their travel plans? I
don't even suspect the Orange Bowl will be a sellout. The whole BCS
system can stick it."</LD>
<LD>   From noblehawk: "I think 80% of us fans, myself included, are
disappointed. We had our tickets ready to go. Who the heck wants to
go to Miami? I wouldn't be surprised if the Rose Bowl tells the BCS
to stick it for the following years. Today the Iowa ticket office
told me I could have eight tickets if I wanted them for the Orange
Bowl. We were only allowed to get four for the Rose Bowl, so the
school knows this is going to be a tougher sell, thousands of Iowa
fans had their trips planned out. I guess I'll save my money and
watch this on TV."</LD>
<TE>   Add Hawkeyes: But the voice of reason comes from poster HawkDevil:
"Why not use those tickets, fly out to LA, get a rental car and drive
to Las Vegas? I had to change my plans but I am going to Vegas for
New Year's now, betting on some bowl games, hitting the craps tables
and watching the Orange Bowl at the sports book at the Bellagio."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Eric Karros played 1,579 games at first base for the
L.A. Dodgers, second behind Steve Garvey's 1,672. Who are Nos. 3, 4
and 5?</TE>
<TE>   Colorful guy: David Beckham has the names of his two sons tattooed
on his back -- and promises there's room for more.</TE>
<TE>   The English soccer star said Sunday he added the name of his
second son, Romeo, to go with the tattooed name of first son,
Brooklyn.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got my other son on my back, so I had to have this one,"
Beckham told BBC television.</TE>
<TE>   The hard part is finding a tattoo artist who doesn't use his
hands.</TE>
<TE>   Speed racer: Ralf Schumacher is having problems on the road -- and
it has nothing to do with Formula One.</TE>
<TE>   The German driver was caught speeding by Austrian police and could
lose his driver's license, Austrian radio reported.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher was on the way to a party given by his BMW-Williams
team when he was stopped. He was going 80 in a 50-mph zone.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher lives in Austria and already lost his license for two
weeks after getting caught for speeding in April 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Police must have studied drafting techniques to catch him.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Wes Parker (1,108), Ron Fairly (557) and Eddie
Murray (458).</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Some advice from Iowa fan redhawk on what regalhawk
can do with his Rose Bowl seats: "You can probably find an Oklahoma
fan who will swap his toothless sister for those tickets. Always look
on the bright side."</TE>

<KH>CLEVELAND 21, JACKSONVILLE 20</KH>
<HD>A Hail Mary by Couch Is Well-Met by Morgan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JACKSONVILLE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The old "Kardiac Kids" were downright boring compared to these new
Cleveland Browns.</LD>
<LD>   In another game decided in the final minute, the Browns beat
Jacksonville, 21-20, when Quincy Morgan caught a desperation heave
from Tim Couch for a touchdown with no time left Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought I had seen everything I could in football," Coach Butch
Davis said. "I guess I hadn't."</LD>
<TE>   Davis has coached 29 games with the Browns. This was the 16th
decided in the last minute.</TE>
<TE>   Officials needed 90 seconds to review and uphold Morgan's 50-yard
touchdown catch, and when that drama was complete, Phil Dawson kicked
the extra point for the winning margin.</TE>
<TE>   Davis sprinted off the field with his son in his arms. Jaguar
Coach Tom Coughlin fell flat to the ground in disbelief.</TE>
<TE>   "Comments are beyond me right now," Coughlin said.</TE>
<TE>   The Browns (7-6) looked all but out of the playoff chase after a
13-6 loss to Carolina last week. But it's folly to count them out.
Their victory, combined with Pittsburgh's surprising loss to Houston,
pulled them within a half-game of the Steelers in the AFC North.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan fought off tight coverage from Fernando Bryant on the final
play. As the two fell to the ground, Morgan cradled Tim Couch's pass
into his body with his right hand.</TE>
<TE>   Side judge Bill Spyksma signaled touchdown. Coughlin insisted he
saw the ball hit the ground, but after the review, referee Ron Winter
said there was no indisputable evidence to overturn the play.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what makes this game so amazing," Morgan said. "Any play
can occur on any given Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   The Jaguars (5-8) lost their third straight and are guaranteed a
non-winning record for the third consecutive season.</TE>

<HD>Buccaneers Give Vick a Lesson in Reality</HD>
<DH>Quarterback is held to 15 yards rushing as Tampa Bay's
defense dominates 34-10 victory over Atlanta.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Stop the revolution, Michael Vick wants to get off.</LD>
<LD>   If the Atlanta quarterback felt a touch of vertigo Sunday, it's
because Tampa Bay's top-ranked defense spun him every direction,
knocked him helmet over heels, and tried to corkscrew him into the
Raymond James Stadium turf. The final tally: a 34-10 victory for the
Buccaneers (10-3), and a revolting afternoon for the NFL's Michael
Jordan.</LD>
<LD>   "We shut down what they said was unstoppable," said defensive end
Simeon Rice, part of a Buccaneer defense that limited Vick to 15
yards rushing and ended an eight-game unbeaten streak by Atlanta
(8-4-1).</LD>
<TE>   Consider this: With less than two minutes remaining in the third
quarter -- just before Vick's longest completion of the day -- his
quarterback rating was a bottom-scraping 19.5 and the Falcons had
amassed only 79 yards and four first downs.</TE>
<TE>   "Those guys have speed," said Vick, who has averaged eight yards
rushing against the Buccaneers, 64.8 in his other 10 games. "They
have speed that other teams don't have. And when you have a defense
with guys that can move around and can run as fast as the guys you
have on offense, you're going to have to fight for everything you
get."</TE>
<TE>   The star quarterback of this game was Tampa Bay's Brad Johnson,
who completed 23 of 31 passes for 276 yards and four touchdowns. Two
of those touchdowns went to Joe Jurevicius, who finished with a
game-high eight catches for 100 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers dominated in total yards, 421 to 181; first downs,
22 to 10; and time of possession, 33:58 to 26:02.</TE>
<TE>   In his last five games, Johnson has 15 touchdown passes, one
interception. And in the last three games, he has emerged triumphant
against the NFC's two most acclaimed quarterbacks: Green Bay's Brett
Favre and Vick.</TE>
<TE>   At least temporarily, Tampa Bay's performance should quiet those
people who bemoan the offense's No. 24 ranking and anemic running
game, which is ranked second to last.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything has been fairly negative," Tampa Bay Coach Jon Gruden
said of what he hears from "stat freaks" who criticize the offense.
"With our players, they're very sensitive to some of those things --
and they should be -- but there have been some promising things to
happen offensively. But we've got to earn our respect, as a team and
as an offensive club."</TE>
<TE>   The offense made up some ground Sunday. The resounding message,
though, was the Buccaneer defense can't be budged.</TE>
<TE>   "The talk all week was, 'How do you stop Michael Vick? How do you
stop Michael Vick,' " Gruden said. "I didn't hear anybody in America
say, 'How do you go up against this defense?' We haven't been chopped
liver all season."</TE>
<TE>   It was the second time this season Vick was pushed through the
Buccaneer meat grinder. In his first game against them -- a 20-6
victory by Tampa Bay two months ago -- Vick missed the second half
because of a strained left shoulder. That left everyone wondering
what might have happened had he been around for the whole game.
Sunday, everyone got their answer.</TE>
<TE>   The performance of the defense was even more impressive because it
mostly came without the help of Pro Bowl safety John Lynch, who
suffered a neck injury in the first quarter and watched the rest of
the game from the sideline. He walked off the field on his own power
and X-rays taken of his neck revealed no damage.</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers intercepted one of Vick's passes -- two if you
count the pick by linebacker Derrick Brooks, whose 74-yard return for
a touchdown was wiped out by an encroachment penalty -- and sacked
him twice.</TE>
<TE>   Vick didn't see what hit him in the third quarter when he was
flattened from behind by defensive end Greg Spires while dropping
back to pass.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy's like Houdini back there in the pocket," Spires said.
"For me to get a sack on him, I was very happy. I hope they got a
picture of that because I want to put that poster on my wall."</TE>
<TE>   Vick, who rushed for 173 yards against Minnesota last week, made
one highlight-reel play against the Buccaneers. He dropped back in
the second quarter, rolled left then right, avoided sack attempts by
Warren Sapp and Rice, and just got off a pass to tight end Alge
Crumpler, who made a one-handed grab for a 20-yard gain.</TE>
<TE>   It was Crumpler who scored Atlanta's lone touchdown, on a
five-yard reception early in the fourth quarter. That also was the
only touchdown the Falcons have scored against Tampa Bay this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers, who were coming off a 23-20 loss at New Orleans,
have proven they can bounce back strong after defeat. They lost their
opener to the Saints, then won five in a row. Then, after a loss at
Philadelphia, they rebounded by winning four in a row.</TE>

<KH>KANSAS CITY 49, ST. LOUIS 10</KH>
<HD>Vermeil Has Gift for Rams: A Long Off-Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>It ended with a big, loud thud for the St. Louis Rams.</LD>
<LD>   Their three-season playoff run, which included two Super Bowl
appearances and one championship, came crashing to a halt Sunday in
one of the most lopsided losses in franchise history.</LD>
<LD>   Dante Hall returned two kicks for touchdowns and Priest Holmes ran
for 132 yards and two more scores, leading Kansas City and Coach Dick
Vermeil to a 49-10 victory over the injury-battered Rams.</LD>
<TE>   "It's embarrassing," Ram cornerback Dexter McCleon said. "That's
all you can say. There wasn't anything good that happened today."</TE>
<TE>   The third-most lopsided loss in team history, combined with San
Francisco's 31-27 victory over Dallas, officially eliminated the
NFC's troubled defending champions (5-8) from playoff contention.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something I'm not used to," said cornerback Dre' Bly. "So
it's tough."</TE>
<TE>   By coincidence, the coach that eliminated the Rams was Vermeil,
who coached St. Louis to the Super Bowl title after the 1999 season.
Vermeil then retired unexpectedly, only to come back a season later
to coach the Chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing vindictive or personal in regards to beating the
St. Louis Rams," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, he had to return a $2-million consultant contract
the Rams had given him upon retiring. And the commissioner ordered
the Chiefs to give the Rams a second- and third-round draft pick as
compensation.</TE>
<TE>   The 49-point outburst was the second in a row for the Chiefs, who
improved to 7-6 with their fourth victory in six games.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams, after starting the season 0-5, had gone on a five-game
winning streak behind backup quarterback Marc Bulger. But with Bulger
and Kurt Warner injured, they've lost three in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Working behind a patchwork offensive line, where only one man was
starting in his normal position, Jamie Martin was sacked six times,
intercepted twice and lost a fumble that was returned 42 yards for a
touchdown by defensive end Duane Clemons.</TE>

<LD>   What: "The Last Game"</LD>
<LD>   Where: ESPN, Tuesday, noon</LD>
<TE>   This may be one of the best sports documentaries ever made. It has
it all -- an incredible story filled with suspense and raw human
emotions. The conclusion is so perfect it's as though it's part of a
screenplay -- except it's doubtful any screenwriter could have come
up with it. In this case, truth is better than fiction.</TE>
<TE>   "The Last Game" tells the story of a successful high school
coach's final season. The coach is Mike Pettine of Central Bucks West
High in Doylestown, Pa., northeast of Philadelphia. In 1998,
Pettine's team won its second consecutive state championship. C.B.
West had won 30 games in a row going into the 1999 season. This film
tells the story of that season, one Pettine decides to make his last.</TE>
<TE>   Pettine faces undefeated North Penn, coached by his son, Mike Jr.,
in its regular-season finale and two weeks later in the playoffs,
which adds to the drama.</TE>
<TE>   Two struggling filmmakers from Philadelphia, T. Patrick Murray and
Alex Weinress, chose Pettine as the subject for a documentary on high
school football. It turned out to be a good choice. Jim Lampley
thought so much of the project he became an executive producer.</TE>
<TE>   The film, also available in DVD and videotape, was selected best
documentary at the Sonoma Film Festival earlier this year. It was
sold to ESPN, which has already aired it on its award-winning series,
"The Season," and will air it again Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   One doesn't have to be a high school football fan, or even a
sports fan, to enjoy this story. However, it's not always pretty.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing is sugar-coated. There are times Pettine comes across as a
jerk. And some of his players come across as arrogant. It's all here
-- the good and bad of high school football.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Doug Moss, the Mighty Duck vice president of business operations,
will resign to become president of the Phoenix Coyotes, a hockey
source said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Moss declined to comment on the situation. But a source said that
Coyote officials contacted Moss immediately after Jim Lites resigned
as team president last month to become the Dallas Stars' president.</LD>
<LD>   An announcement is expected within a few days. Moss will
officially join the Coyotes in three weeks.</LD>
<TE>   The move comes eight months after Moss was hired to run the
business side of the Ducks. Moss has tried to generate renewed fan
interest in a franchise that finished last in attendance last season.
He cut ticket prices on 9,053 seats and instituted a more
fan-friendly environment at the Arrowhead Pond.</TE>
<TE>   Moss, 49, was the Buffalo Sabres' president and chief executive
from 1994-96. Before that he spent one season as the International
Hockey League commissioner. He was president of the Madison Square
Garden Network from 1992-94.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The NHL board of governors will begin meetings today in Phoenix.
Among the topics will be the medical coverage for players on Canadian
teams. As of Jan. 1, the Canadian Medical Protective Assn. will make
malpractice insurance available to doctors at major league sporting
events.... Duck defenseman Ruslan Salei sat out for the fifth time in
six games because of back and abdomen injuries.</TE>

<HD>Duo Works for the Ducks</HD>
<DH>Surprising Havelid and fitter Olausson score goals as
defense translates into offense in 3-0 win over Predators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was little reason to expect much from defenseman Niclas
Havelid. He was a spare part, a damaged one at that, as Mighty Duck
General Manager Bryan Murray began to piece together a roster last
summer.</LD>
<LD>   The expectations were placed elsewhere, on Fredrik Olausson,
another defenseman, brought in to provide some offense from the blue
line.</LD>
<LD>   Their role reversal has steadily evolved.</LD>
<TE>   Havelid, fully rehabilitated from a knee injury suffered in
January 2001, has provided the offense. Olausson became the question
mark, trying to regain the form that made him so successful for 14
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   That balanced out a little Sunday, when each scored goals to push
the Ducks to a 3-0 victory over the Nashville Predators in front of
an announced 11,979 at the Arrowhead Pond.</TE>
<TE>   Havelid scored to give the Ducks a 1-0 lead in the first period.
Olausson, expected to play his 1,000th NHL game Wednesday, made it
2-0 in the second period with his first regular-season goal since
Nov. 7, 2001. They were part of a tapestry that made the Ducks'
return from a five-day trip a fine homecoming.</TE>
<TE>   Petr Sykora scored his second goal in as many games. The Ducks had
two power-play goals. Goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere had light duty,
but stopped 20 shots for his 10th career shutout.</TE>
<TE>   But the emphasis afterward was on the defense, specifically the
offense from the defense.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't score if you don't have a fourth guy on the attack,"
Duck captain Paul Kariya said. "Teams back-check so hard. They have
four guys back [on defense] half the time. You have to attack to
score.</TE>
<TE>   "Nicky has been very good all year, jumping up into the play,
creating offensive scoring chances. It was nice to get Freddy
involved. He played one of his strongest games. That was a good two
points for us."</TE>
<TE>   Which let the Ducks continue to loiter in an area previously off
limits ... the playoff race.</TE>
<TE>   The Predators were a bit fatigued in playing their third game in
four nights. They didn't have a shot on goal until 16:52 into the
first period.</TE>
<TE>   Nor was history on their side after Kariya returned a pass to
Havelid, who stuck a shot just under the crossbar for a 1-0 lead
14:32 into the first period, a lead the Ducks took into the dressing
room.</TE>
<TE>   "The first 10 minutes of the game were obviously the key," Giguere
said. "We wanted to show them we were not going to give them
anything."</TE>
<TE>   Nothing was clearly what the Predators were going to get late in
the second period when Sykora redirected a Matt Cullen shot for a
power-play goal and a 3-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The victory moved the Ducks into seventh place and gave them 31
points in 29 games, the best start in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to continue to hang around," Coach Mike Babcock said.</TE>
<TE>   That is what Olausson has done much of the season. He helped
Detroit win the Stanley Cup last season and the Ducks picked him up
with the mandate to help improve the power play.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, he struggled from the start of the season and took himself
out of the lineup in November to get in playing shape, returning only
after Ruslan Salei injured his back. Olausson, though, was a
non-issue because of Havelid, who has four goals, tops among Duck
defensemen.</TE>
<TE>   Olausson chipped in on a second-period power play.</TE>
<TE>   Said Olausson: "I'd rather do it now than 30 games down the road."</TE>

<KH>NEW YORK JETS 19, DENVER 13</KH>
<HD>Broncos in Fade Pattern</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>On a day of individual milestones, the New York Jets wanted to talk
about collective achievement.</LD>
<LD>   Such as winning their fifth game in the last six, a 19-13 victory
over Denver that severely damaged the Broncos' playoff hopes. And
rallying to win for the first time with Chad Pennington at
quarterback.</LD>
<LD>   And staying alive in the AFC East race despite being outplayed for
much of Sunday's game in the wind and occasional flurries.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a total team win," said Pennington, who connected with
Laveranues Coles on a 28-yard touchdown pass play into the wind to
put the Jets (7-6) in front 17 seconds into the fourth quarter. "The
offense came through and grabbed the lead and the defense held it."</TE>
<TE>   Coles, who went over 1,000 yards receiving for the first time in
his three-year career, came through to make a spectacular grab.</TE>
<TE>   He beat Tyrone Poole's single coverage to make a diving catch at
the two, then rolled untouched into the end zone for a 16-13 lead.
Coles finished with six catches for 126 yards and has 73 for 1,022
this season.</TE>
<TE>   "It was sort of weird, because my helmet was kind of fluttering
around in different directions," Coles said. "I didn't get focused on
the ball until the last second."</TE>
<TE>   Curtis Martin became the 16th player to go over 10,000 career
yards rushing and scored the Jets' other touchdown. Martin did not
play a pivotal role Sunday, but he did his share. All of the Jets
did.</TE>
<TE>   The loss was the third in a row for the Broncos (7-6). They were
in position to win in the final minutes, but Brian Griese, back from
a knee injury, was picked off at the New York two by rookie Jon
McGraw, his first career interception.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we deserve it right now," said Griese, who
completed 28 of 37 passes for 266 yards. "We've lost three in a row
and any team that has lost three in a row doesn't deserve to be a
playoff team."</TE>
<TE>   New York's bend-but-don't-break defense, led by Marvin Jones' 17
tackles, helped keep the Jets one game out of the AFC East lead.</TE>
<TE>   Denver is two games behind AFC West-leading Oakland (9-4).</TE>

<HD>Murray Sends Message</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hand-wringing was the order of the day Sunday for the Kings, who
treated Saturday night's 4-2 loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets as if
it were a playoff game instead of one of 82 during an interminable
regular season.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, it didn't help that they'd also lost two of their
previous three games at Staples Center, most recently Thursday
against Nashville.</LD>
<LD>   Originally scheduled for a day off, the players were told to
report for an 11 a.m. practice that would not require pucks. In other
words: Skate till you drop. Some were brought into Coach Andy
Murray's office to meet with the coach, his assistants and General
Manager Dave Taylor.</LD>
<TE>   It was not for a pat on the back.</TE>
<TE>   Then, at the appointed hour, with the players dressed for
practice, they were told, via a message on a grease board, to go
home.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a message in itself: We're not very happy, get out of
here," Murray said. "People may say, 'You're overreacting; it's only
a loss.' But we take the losses more seriously than the wins. That's
the feeling I want to have."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky, sidelined since Nov. 23 because of
back spasms, will try to practice today and might be able to play
Tuesday night at Nashville, Murray said.... Because of injuries, the
Kings' top line of Jason Allison, Ziggy Palffy and Adam Deadmarsh has
been intact for only four games, producing 16 points, eight by
Allison.... Craig Johnson, weakened by flu, sat out the last two
games, but Murray said he might not have played anyway. The veteran
winger has two points in 24 games, none in his last 17, and hasn't
scored a regular-season goal since March 4, a 36-game drought. He
scored 13 last season.</TE>

<HD>Shaq, Lakers Get Some Elevation</HD>
<DH>Rounding into form, center moves well while scoring 32 as
L.A. beats Utah, 110-101, for rare two-game win streak.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers were not going to knock the occasional fall-out-of-the-sky
miracle, whatever it was that happened on the same floor a couple of
nights before.</LD>
<LD>   But routine had its place too, something about them leaning on the
same two guys, gaining a little on a first month misspent, playing
through the ends of most quarters.</LD>
<LD>   They defeated the Utah Jazz, 110-101, Sunday night at Staples
Center because Shaquille O'Neal drew closer to his usual game, and
because Kobe Bryant again played well in all of the corners they
needed him to.</LD>
<TE>   It was their second consecutive win, and you'd only need to have
paid attention for a short while to know that's not too small of an
accomplishment. A win Tuesday in Golden State would give them their
first three-game winning streak, by then 23 games into a season
they're hoping will meld into a fourth consecutive title.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal had 32 points -- he made 13 of 19 shots -- and 11 rebounds.
Bryant, on a sore groin that tightened again in the fourth quarter,
had 25 points and 14 assists, the latter one shy of his career high.
He also had five steals.</TE>
<TE>   Last week they lost dismally by eight points in Utah, where their
energy was shot and their postgame patience short, O'Neal actually
calling for more manpower. Karl Malone scored 29 points then; he had
11 -- on three-for-16 shooting -- Sunday. And so the Lakers appear to
have emerged from the Dallas Maverick experience -- the 27-point
fourth-quarter comeback -- with a healthy desire to hold that
momentum.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand the importance of these games now," Bryant said.
"We have to come ready to play. And we're back to playing Laker-style
basketball."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal might have thought so, too, but the world would never know.
Around the time the locker room opened for reporters to enter, he was
rolling from the parking lot in his new Hummer. This much is true: It
appears to be becoming an easier game for O'Neal, who is jumping
higher, quicker and without having to load up. He blocked three
shots, and was around the rim more often.</TE>
<TE>   "And," Coach Phil Jackson said, "he recovered a missed shot, was
back at the rim quickly. In fact, Tex [Winter] mentioned to him he
looked like he was getting himself back into game shape."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers led by as many as 20 points midway through the fourth
quarter, and for most of the game kept the Jazz at arm's length.
There remained a habit for turnovers (21, leading to 25 Jazz points)
and the occasional defensive lapse (Andrei Kirilenko scored 30 points
in 36 minutes), but Jackson was otherwise satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   "I liked our aggressive behavior tonight," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Before the first quarter was done, Utah center Greg Ostertag and
Coach Jerry Sloan were ejected by the same referee.</TE>
<TE>   It left the Jazz with six fewer fouls and seven fewer feet to use
against O'Neal, a problem for Utah on a night O'Neal became a little
more mobile, a little more physical.</TE>
<TE>   "You are never going to guard Shaq anyways," Sloan said. "He is
going to score with ease. They let him sit in the lane for a
half-hour, he's got an advantage to start with."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers, of course, see that quite differently. Ostertag,
Bryant said, "didn't want to play against Shaq. That's the whole
reason he did that."</TE>
<TE>   Jarron Collins and John Amaechi took their shots, and by the end
of the first quarter O'Neal had made seven of eight attempts and
scored 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   It looked hopeless for the Jazz. Utah had won three games in a row
and nine of 10, then looked startled by the Lakers' fast start, a
34-point first quarter, but wasn't totally overrun.</TE>
<TE>   After playing dismal basketball for the better part of six weeks,
the Lakers had put up back-to-back, end-to-end quarters, outscoring
the Mavericks and Jazz by a combined 78-36.</TE>
<TE>   Ostertag left the floor arguing that he'd been fouled by O'Neal,
and in the arms of teammate Matt Harpring, who tried in vain to keep
his center in the game. Ostertag's fit on his way to the locker room
included kicking a pile of towels near the Utah bench and tearing
down part of a tarp over the tunnel, a spectacular show for an adult.
Sloan was gone six minutes later, run off by referee Derek Richardson
as well.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers played on, only too happy for the help. They improved
to 9-13, 6-4 with O'Neal in their lineup, knowing they're just
getting started on the routine again.</TE>
<TE>   "All in all, I think the confidence seems to be pretty up," Bryant
said. "Guys came out and really started hitting some shots.
Hopefully, that will keep up."</TE>

<HD>Gramatica Ends Horrid Matchup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Two bad teams needed overtime to determine which was worse Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Gramatica kicked a 42-yard field goal with 10:48 left in
overtime and the Arizona Cardinals ended a losing streak at six with
a 23-20 victory over the Detroit Lions, who lost their fifth
consecutive game overall and 15th in a row on the road.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a huge, huge win for where we are right now," Coach Dave
McGinnis said. "I love the effort. I still don't like the record, but
I love the outcome."</LD>
<TE>   Gramatica also had field goals of 29 and 41 yards. The 41-yarder
tied the score, 20-20, with 3:20 to go in regulation. The Cardinals
(5-8) never led until his final field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Jake Plummer completed 24 of 43 passes for 228 yards and two
touchdowns, despite a depleted corps of receivers. It was the 21st
time Plummer had brought his team back from a tie or a deficit in the
fourth quarter; he has done it in all five of Arizona's wins this
season.</TE>
<TE>   The game was the 21st this season to go to overtime, tying the
1995 league record.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit (3-10) lost in overtime for the second time in three
games. The Lions were beaten by Chicago, 20-17, on Nov. 24 when Coach
Marty Mornhinweg chose to kick off after winning the overtime coin
flip and the Bears drove to a field goal.</TE>
<TE>   The announced crowd of 28,640 was Arizona's smallest this season
and its fourth under 30,000.</TE>
<TE>   Two penalties in the overtime helped the Cardinals. Todd Lyght was
called for pass interference for the second time in the game to keep
the drive going.</TE>

<HD>Azevedo Leads Stanford to Men's Water Polo Title</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Azevedo scored four goals, drew several key ejections and forced
a turnover in the closing seconds Sunday to lift Stanford to a 7-6
victory over California in the NCAA men's water polo championship
game at Loyola Marymount's Burns Recreation and Aquatics Center. It's
the second consecutive title for the Cardinal and 10th overall.</LD>
<LD>   Azevedo, a sophomore from Long Beach, scored four of his team's
last five goals.</LD>
<LD>   His fourth goal came on a backhand shot with 4:42 left, giving the
Cardinal a 7-4 lead. California, which was trying for its 12th
national title, pulled to within one on Greg Panawek's goal with 1:46
left, but couldn't capitalize on its last two possessions. Azevedo
clinched the victory when he knocked down a pass from Todd Hylton
with 10 seconds remaining.</LD>
<TE>   "He's a great, great player," California Coach Kirk Everist said.
"He's got a wealth of experience, practically growing up on the
national team."</TE>
<TE>   Azevedo, who at 18 was the youngest member of the 2000 Olympic
team, began developing his skills while tagging along with his
father, Ricardo, a member of 1976 and 1980 Olympic teams, and an
assistant coach for the U.S. teams in 1992 and 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Azevedo said his adrenaline began pumping after teammate Peter
Hudnut scored two goals in the opening minutes to give the Cardinal a
2-0 lead. California tied the score, 3-3, midway through the second
quarter, but Azevedo drew an ejection on the next possession and
scored off his own rebound to give Stanford the lead for good.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted nothing more than to send [the seniors] out with a
championship," Azevedo said.</TE>

<TE>   Didier Cuche of Switzerland shrugged off a 10-minute delay while
course workers repaired safety nets and won a World Cup super-giant
slalom at Beaver Creek, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Cuche beat Liechtenstein's Marco Buechel by 0.08 seconds on the
Birds of Prey course for his fourth career win in eight seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Cuche covered the tight course in 1:18.83.</TE>
<TE>   Austria's Hannes Trinkl was third in 1:18.93. Bode Miller of
Franconia, N.H., was sixth in 1:19.12.</TE>
<TE>   Austria's Stephan Eberharter, seeking his fourth consecutive
Alpine skiing victory, went wide in a turn early in his run and
couldn't recover, finishing in a tie for 15th at 1:20.09.</TE>
<TE>   Eberharter, the defending World Cup overall, downhill and super-G
champion, had won four of the first six events this season.</TE>
<TE>   The demanding course claimed six skiers among the first 30,
including Daron Rahlves of Sugar Bowl, Calif., who fell only 11
seconds into his run.</TE>
<TE>   Austria's Fritz Strobl, starting 28th, crashed through two safety
fences.</TE>
<TE>   He appeared to be unhurt, but the lengthy delay to repair the nets
forced Cuche, starting 29th, and Eberharter, starting 30th, to wait.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic bronze medalist Karen Putzer of Italy won a World Cup
super-G at Lake Louise, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Putzer finished in 1:10.68. Germany's Martina Ertl was second in
1:10.97 and France's Carole Montillet, the winner of Saturday's
downhill, was third in 1:11.13.</TE>
<TE>   Four-time Olympic biathlon champion Ole Einar Bjorndalen of Norway
won his 25th World Cup event, beating defending overall champion
Rapahel Poiree of France by 29 seconds in a pursuit at Ostersund,
Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   Bjorndalen covered the 12.5-kilometer race in 35:46.4. Germany's
Kati Wilhelm won the women's 10-kilometer pursuit, finishing 16.1
seconds ahead of Russia's Olga Zaitseva.</TE>
<TE>   Bjorn Kircheisen of Germany won his third World Cup Nordic
combined event in three days at Trondheim, Norway, and Johnny
Spillane of Steamboat Springs, Colo., posted his third consecutive
top-three finish.</TE>
<TE>   Kircheisen beat countryman Ronny Ackermann by 10 seconds in the
7.5-kilometer cross-country ski race.</TE>
<TE>   Spillane was third, 18.1 seconds behind. He was runner-up Friday,
3.3 seconds behind Kircheisen, and third Saturday, 1.4 seconds back.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Henrik Zetterberg's goal 1:59 into overtime gave the Detroit Red
Wings a 4-3 victory over the St. Louis Blues on Sunday night in a
matchup of the Central Division's two top teams at Detroit.</LD>
<LD>   Zetterberg one-timed a pass from Jason Woolley past St. Louis
goaltender Fred Brathwaite from the bottom of the right circle.</LD>
<LD>   "I was pretty sure he was going to pass it to me," Zetterberg
said. "It was a lucky shot. I think it went through the five hole."</LD>
<TE>   Brathwaite thought he should have stopped the shot.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the game, I have to make that save," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Blues' Cory Stillman took an elbowing penalty with only four
seconds remaining in regulation time and Zetterberg scored right
after the penalty expired.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Cajanek's goal with 2:12 left in the third period tied the
score at 3-3 for the Blues, who were without Keith Tkackuk and Pavol
Demitra, and sent it into overtime. He tipped in a shot from the
point by Barret Jackman 40 seconds after the Red Wings had taken the
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Chelios' goal with 2:52 left gave Detroit a 3-2 lead. His
slap shot from the left point deflected in off the stick of the
Blues' Steve Dubinsky.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Mellanby's power-play goal 4:56 into the third period tied
it at 2-2. His slap shot from the high slot beat Curtis Joseph low to
the glove side with Mathieu Dandenault off for tripping.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit scored twice in the second period to take a 2-1 lead.
Brett Hull tied the score at 1-1 with a power-play goal 1:44 into the
second period. He put in a rebound only seconds after he had hit the
goal post with a slap shot.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton 3, Atlanta 0 -- Tommy Salo stopped 15 shots at Atlanta
for his third shutout in 10 games as the Oilers continued to play
solid defense.</TE>
<TE>   Jiri Dopita, Ethan Moreau and Anson Carter scored for the Oilers,
who improved to 10-2-1 in their last 13 games. They've allowed only
18 goals in that span, and have limited opponents to two or fewer
goals in 10 of the 13.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta, which had scored 27 goals in its previous six games, is
.500 (7-7-0-2) in its last 16 games.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 4, New York Rangers 1 -- Bryan Berard and Joe Thornton
scored goals late in the second period, leading the Eastern
Conference-leading Bruins at Madison Square Garden.</TE>
<TE>   Ivan Huml and Marty McInnis added third-period goals for the
Bruins, who won for the seventh time in eight games. John Grahame
made 23 saves to improve to 9-2-1.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 3, Tampa Bay 1 -- Theo Fleury scored a tiebreaking goal
with 4:57 left in the third period to help the Blackhawks win at
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Fleury, playing only his second game this season, scored when his
shot from right wing struck the post and angled in over the goal line
behind goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin.</TE>

<KH>SAN FRANCISCO 31, DALLAS 27</KH>
<HD>Owens Is Guest Star Once Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>IRVING, Texas</DL>
<LD>Terrell Owens keeps finding ways to make Dallas Cowboy fans
miserable.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco 49ers' star not only caught two touchdown passes
in the fourth quarter -- including the game-winner with 12 seconds
left -- he rubbed it in with his words and his wardrobe after a 31-27
victory Sunday that clinched the NFC West title.</LD>
<LD>   Although Jeff Garcia led San Francisco (9-4) back from a 10-point
fourth-quarter deficit and guided the final scoring drive without
timeouts, Owens grabbed the spotlight by getting wide open in the
back of the end zone and hauling in the game-deciding touchdown pass,
an eight-yard play.</LD>
<TE>   "The play worked to perfection," said Garcia, who went 36 for 55
for 276 yards with no interceptions and three touchdowns, all in the
fourth quarter. Garcia also led his team in rushing with 50 yards,
including a 21-yard touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   Two years after punctuating a pair of touchdowns with celebrations
at the Cowboys' midfield logo, Owens showed up at Texas Stadium
wearing a leather jacket, leather pants and shoes all in Cowboy blue.</TE>
<TE>   Why? "Because I knew all eyes were going to be on me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Owens relished living up to his expectations. "It's kind of like
Michael Jordan taking the last shot at the end of the game," he said.</TE>
<TE>   While the 49ers went from a possible third loss in four games to
winning their first division title in five years, the Cowboys (5-8)
lost their shot at their first three-game winning streak since they
started the 1999 season 3-0.</TE>

<KH>GREEN BAY 26, MINNESOTA 22</KH>
<HD>Packers Chill Bitter Vikings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GREEN BAY, Wis.</DL>
<LD>For all but the final few minutes of a game played in single-digit
temperatures, the Minnesota Vikings looked as if they were the ones
accustomed to freezing conditions and not the Green Bay Packers.</LD>
<LD>   But Tony Fisher's 14-yard touchdown run with 1:06 left gave Green
Bay its first lead of the game and a 26-22 victory over the Vikings
on Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   Darren Sharper picked off Daunte Culpepper's desperation pass as
time expired and returned the ball 66 yards before finally being
stopped at the Minnesota 16-yard line.</LD>
<TE>   The bad blood between the rivals boiled over at that point as
Viking tight end Jim Kleinsasser gave a two-handed shove to Packer
safety Marques Anderson near the Minnesota bench. As players from
both teams converged to break up the fracas or join in, Viking
defensive tackle Chris Hovan jawed with Packer quarterback Brett
Favre. Hovan said he followed Favre toward the Packers' tunnel to
shake his hand but instead got an earful of taunts from Favre, who
was surrounded by coaches that looked like bodyguards.</TE>
<TE>   "This thing just got bigger," Hovan fumed of his budding feud with
Favre.</TE>
<TE>   Favre shrugged it off: "I think he wanted to see our locker room.
He may have wanted a piece of me. But he's too big for me."</TE>
<TE>   Favre said he didn't say anything disparaging to Hovan.</TE>
<TE>   Hovan disagreed: "Yes, he did disrespect me. I can't wait for next
year."</TE>
<TE>   The victory enabled the Packers (10-3) to keep pace with
Philadelphia and Tampa Bay for home-field advantage in the NFC
playoffs. The Vikings (3-10) reached double-digit losses for the
second season in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Favre improved to 34-0 in home games when the temperature at
kickoff was 34 or lower.</TE>

<KH>CAROLINA 52, CINCINNATI 31</KH>
<HD>Smith Sends Clear Message to Bengals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Knowing that actions speak louder than words, Steve Smith finally did
something to make the Carolina Panthers proud of him again.</LD>
<LD>   Smith, struggling on and off the field in a disappointing second
season, scored three touchdowns -- two on punt returns -- and had a
career-high 313 yards to lead the Carolina Panthers to a 52-31
victory over the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   His touchdowns earned him hugs and high-fives from his teammates,
most of whom were slow to accept him when he returned last week from
a suspension for beating up teammate Anthony Bright, who was
hospitalized for two days and filed charges against Smith.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't have to show the team anything -- they showed me that
they trust me by letting me play," Smith said. "I'm just trying to be
a pro. I've got to remember where I am and how fortunate I am to be
in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to practice well and be the new Steve."</TE>
<TE>   Carolina (5-8) won its second consecutive game, set a franchise
record for points scored, had a season-high 401 yards and improved to
3-0 against AFC North teams.</TE>
<TE>   Rodney Peete completed 21 of 29 passes for a season-high 319 yards
-- four yards short of his career high -- and three touchdowns. Smith
had five catches for a career-high 144 yards and Muhsin Muhammad had
eight catches for 106 yards. The Panthers tied Oakland for the most
points scored this season.</TE>
<TE>   But their offense didn't get rolling until the second half --
Carolina's 16 points in the first half were scored by its defense or
special teams.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati (1-12) got a solid outing from quarterback Jon Kitna,
who threw for two touchdowns and ran for another. The Bengals must
win two of their last three games to avert their worst record in
franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not playing good football, we do bad things," Bengal end
Justin Smith said.</TE>

<KH>NEW ENGLAND 27, BUFFALO 17</KH>
<HD>Brady Keeps Upper Hand</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FOXBORO, Mass.</DL>
<LD>For the second consecutive season, Tom Brady is pushing Drew Bledsoe
toward a disappointing finish.</LD>
<LD>   Bledsoe threw four interceptions, and his former understudy threw
two touchdown passes as the New England Patriots beat the Buffalo
Bills, 27-17, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   That put the Patriots (8-5) in first place in the AFC East by a
half-game over Miami, which plays Chicago tonight. The Bills (6-7)
trail by two games with three to play.</LD>
<TE>   This was Bledsoe's first game at New England since the team traded
him following its Super Bowl win.</TE>
<TE>   "Every game I've ever played I've taken personally, this one more
than most," Bledsoe said. "With the turnovers, it falls heavily on my
shoulders."</TE>
<TE>   At least Bledsoe reached the playoffs last season with the
Patriots. He suffered a severe chest injury late in the second game,
and Brady took over. Brady kept the job after Bledsoe healed, then
became the MVP of the Super Bowl, which Bledsoe watched from the
sideline.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe's career was revived in Buffalo, and he helped the Bills
go from a 3-13 season to challenging for the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   But his four interceptions Sunday were the most he had thrown in
33 games, and the Bills lost for the fourth time in five games.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels weird [playing against Bledsoe]," Patriot center Damien
Woody said. "I think the trade worked out well for both teams. It
certainly worked out for us."</TE>
<TE>   New England led, 20-0, at halftime on the way to its fifth win in
six games.</TE>
<TE>   "With everybody so bunched together in the standings, we have to
be in playoff mode," New England safety Lawyer Milloy said. "We
understand that each week, if you lose a game, you could be bumped
out of the playoffs."</TE>

<LD>Is it physically possible for an NFL team to lose a game during its
open date?</LD>
<LD>   The theory is worth testing, so maybe the Cincinnati Bengals or
the Detroit Lions can get a government grant for further research
next year. But until then, scientists, mathematicians, statisticians
and philosophers will have to make do with the incredible raw data
provided by Sunday's Houston-Pittsburgh box score.</LD>
<LD>   On Sept. 22, the Sunday of their open date, the day they played no
one, the Pittsburgh Steelers gave up 0.0 yards per passing play, 0.0
yards per rushing play and 0 first downs.</LD>
<TE>   On Dec. 8, with the expansion Houston Texans somehow allegedly
involved, the Steelers gave up 0.7 yards per passing play, 1.4 yards
per rushing play and three first downs.</TE>
<TE>   And lost, 24-6.</TE>
<TE>   Forget the two-kicks-to-make-one overtime victory over Cleveland
and Tommy Maddox's franchise-record 473 passing yards in the 34-34
tie with Atlanta. Sunday's scrimmage at Heinz Field, where the home
team took on the blocking sled and lost, qualifies hands down as the
Steelers' weirdest game of their 2002 season, if not their history.</TE>
<TE>   To paraphrase the late Al McGuire, Houston quarterback David Carr
passed for 10 more net yards than a dead man ... and still beat the
Steelers by 18 points.</TE>
<TE>   Carr and his teammates managed 47 more yards than "IDLE" ... and
still outscored the Steelers, three touchdowns to none.</TE>
<TE>   "We won, 24-6," Carr acknowledged, because it said so, right on
the scoreboard, "but we didn't do anything."</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh held a 422-47 edge in total yards.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh held a 95-40 edge in offensive plays.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh had 24-3 edge in first downs.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh lost in a rout.</TE>
<TE>   The Texans, who tend to go overboard whenever they win a game,
have already published a glossy 144-page coffee-table book titled
"Opening Night," which chronicles their four quarters of glory in
their 19-10 inaugural triumph over Dallas. Alert the printer, Volume
II is on its way. Working title: "Victory By Inertia."</TE>
<TE>   Carr was right; the Texans won -- and they didn't do anything. The
Steelers, shaking their heads and muttering to themselves as they
left the field, had to be thinking: If only Maddox had done the same
-- if he hadn't done anything -- they might have had a chance.</TE>
<TE>   In his first game back since getting knocked out of the Steelers'
Nov. 17 loss at Tennessee, Maddox threw 57 passes and completed 32 --
30 to teammates, two to Houston cornerback Aaron Glenn. Glenn went 70
yards and 65 yards, for Houston touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Maddox also scrambled twice for six yards. Once, he left the ball
on the ground, just gingerly laid it there, as if he were pausing to
wash his hands before completing his run around right end. Houston
cornerback Kenny Wright retrieved the ball and carried it 40 yards --
for another Texan touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   With three defensive touchdowns, each the result of Maddox
turnovers, and a 43-yard field goal by Kris Brown, the former Steeler
kicker driven out of Pittsburgh for driving Bill Cowher crazy, the
Texans had their 24 points. When Pittsburgh could counter with no
more than a couple of field goals of its own, the Texans also had the
fourth victory of their existence.</TE>
<TE>   In was a big day for turning nothing into something quite
substantial, none of it very good for the Steelers. In Jacksonville,
Cleveland scored with nothing left on the clock, when Tim Couch had
nothing left to do except heave a desperate Hail Mary toward the end
zone and the Jaguar defense could do nothing right on the play.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 20-14, Couch needed 50 yards in one play. The Browns
knew it. The Jaguars knew it. Everyone watching in Jacksonville and
Cleveland knew it. So what were the Jaguars doing in single coverage
on Quincy Morgan, who had already scored on a 60-yard reception?
Especially when Morgan is 6 feet 1 and the lone Jaguar covering him,
Fernando Bryant, is generously listed at 5-10?</TE>
<TE>   Morgan outjumped Bryant for the ball -- will wonders never cease?
-- and came down with the touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Out of nowhere, the Browns are 7-6 and within a half-game of 7-5-1
Pittsburgh in the race for first place in the AFC North.</TE>
<TE>   Jacksonville Coach Tom Coughlin usually responds to heartbreaking
defeats by cutting the kicker. (Danny Boyd, who under-hit a squib
kickoff that set up Couch's fling-and-a-prayer, is the Jaguars'
fourth kicker this season.) What does Coughlin do after this one?
Fire his defensive coordinator? Or, perhaps, himself?</TE>
<TE>   With three games left in the regular season, six of eight division
races remain unsettled. Green Bay clinched the NFC North championship
last week. San Francisco won the NFC West title Sunday when the 49ers
edged the Cowboys, 31-27, on a last-second touchdown pass from Jeff
Garcia to Terrell Owens and the Rams were routed in Kansas City by
their old coach, Dick Vermeil, 49-10.</TE>
<TE>   (That was a fittingly surreal conclusion to the Rams' three-year,
two-Super Bowl playoff run. After being humiliated by their
cross-state rival and eliminated from playoff contention, the Rams
marked the occasion by forming a reception line to wrap joyful bear
hugs around Vermeil).</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia is on the verge of its second consecutive NFC East
title after third-string quarterback A.J. Feeley won his second
consecutive start, 27-20, over Seattle. The Eagles, 10-3, can wrap up
the championship with a victory over Washington or a loss by the 7-6
New York Giants to Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   In the NFC South, Tampa Bay (10-3) stayed a game ahead of New
Orleans (9-4) with its 34-10 victory over Atlanta, limiting Falcon
quarterback Michael Vick to 158 fewer yards than he managed the
previous week. But nothing really is settled in a division where the
Buccaneers swept the season series from the Falcons, who swept the
season series from the Saints, who swept the season series from the
Buccaneers.</TE>
<TE>   In the AFC, Tennessee and Indianapolis are tied at 8-5 atop the
South after the Titans' 27-17 win over the Colts and New England
assured itself of at least a tie for first in the East when the
Patriots defeated Buffalo, 27-17, to complete a season sweep of
ex-Patriot Drew Bledsoe. New England is 8-5, a record Miami can match
with a victory over Chicago tonight.</TE>
<TE>   And in San Diego, the Raiders (9-4) moved a game ahead San Diego
(8-5) in the AFC West with a 27-7 victory over the Chargers.</TE>
<TE>   What's it all mean?</TE>
<TE>   At this point, nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Which is not necessarily a bad thing, as the Houston Texans will
attest.</TE>

<HD>Raiders Enjoy Day in San Diego</HD>
<DH>Gannon sets an NFL passing record in a 27-7 victory in
which Chargers' Brees and Tomlinson are stifled. Oakland takes
division lead.</DH>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Another 300-yard passing game for Rich Gannon. Another rowdy crowd.
Another three-interception game for the defense.</LD>
<LD>   Just another Oakland Raider victory.</LD>
<LD>   Gannon, the Raider quarterback, passed for 328 yards as the
Raiders defeated the San Diego Chargers, 27-7, Sunday to move into
sole possession of first place in the AFC West.</LD>
<TE>   Before a raucous crowd of 67,968, with Raider fans bellowing
louder than Charger fans, the Charger offense sputtered and the
defense was porous.</TE>
<TE>   "We had opportunities but we stepped on our own feet," safety
Rodney Harrison said.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders (9-4) moved a game ahead of the Chargers (8-5) in the
division. The Chargers have lost four of the last six; the Raiders
have won five in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Gannon set an NFL record with his 10th 300-yard game in a season,
breaking a tie among him, Kurt Warner, Warren Moon and Dan Marino.</TE>
<TE>   (Another record was the more than 120 arrests made for fighting
and drunkenness among fans, a high number even for a Charger-Raider
game.)</TE>
<TE>   Charger running back LaDainian Tomlinson gained only 57 yards in
18 carries and quarterback Drew Brees was sacked twice and threw
three interceptions, including one in the third quarter when the
Chargers were on the verge of taking the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a young quarterback who is going to be outstanding
[but] there are going to be days like this," Charger Coach Marty
Schottenheimer said.</TE>
<TE>   Down 13-7 at halftime, the Chargers pushed to the Oakland 30 with
a 37-yard punt return by Tim Dwight and a 15-yard run by Tomlinson.
But a Brees pass intended for Dwight was intercepted by Raider
cornerback Tory James at the 13.</TE>
<TE>   Two plays later, Gannon connected with Jerry Rice for a 56-yard
gain. A one-yard touchdown run by Zack Crockett pushed the Raiders'
lead to 20-7.</TE>
<TE>   The 56-yard play, said Rice, "really jump-started us."</TE>
<TE>   Said Gannon: "The way the defense played today, I felt we had to
take advantage of some of the opportunities, and that was one of
them."</TE>
<TE>   Brees was 22 for 41 for 239 yards. Schottenheimer said he never
considered pulling Brees in favor of veteran Doug Flutie. But he did
bench rookie standout guard Toniu Fonoti in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "We struggled up front," Schottenheimer said.</TE>
<TE>   When the Chargers beat the Raiders, 27-21, in overtime in Oakland
earlier this season, Tomlinson gained 153 yards, including the
game-winning 19-yard touchdown. Not this time.</TE>
<TE>   "Our guys put a lot of hits on number 21 [Tomlinson]," Raider
Coach Bill Callahan said. "I thought that was one of the deciding
factors."</TE>
<TE>   Gannon completed 26 of 41 passes and Rice caught seven passes for
113 yards.</TE>
<TE>   One bright spot for the Chargers was Eric Parker, who caught a
career-high seven passes for 96 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers' only score came on a one-yard dive by Tomlinson in
the second quarter. With his 57 yards he set a Charger single-season
record of 1,375, eclipsing the mark of 1,350 set by Natrone Means in
1994.</TE>
<TE>   "It's bittersweet," Tomlinson said. "Obviously you want a win to
go with it but that's not the way it worked out."</TE>

<LD>OneWorld lost but dodged a death penalty. Team Dennis Conner won, but
its hopes for this America's Cup died with the Arbitration Panel's
decision Sunday night that the Seattle team broke the rules, if not
seriously enough to be disqualified.</LD>
<LD>   That was the ironic and extraordinary outcome of a submission to
the panel by the New York Yacht Club and Yacht Club Punta Ala,
representing Team Dennis Conner and Italy's Prada team, respectively,
that the team owned by billionaires Craig McCaw and Paul Allen had
stolen design information from Team New Zealand.</LD>
<LD>   The panel of five international sailor-jurists penalized OneWorld
one point for all subsequent series it may sail, including the
America's Cup Match against defender Team New Zealand in February.
That means OneWorld would have to win five of seven races in the
current Louis Vuitton Cup challenger semifinals and six of nine in
the challenger finals and America's Cup Match to survive.</LD>
<TE>   Their opponents still would need to win the usual four of seven or
five of nine.</TE>
<TE>   Team Dennis Conner, which was Conner's ninth America's Cup, was
eliminated by OneWorld in the quarterfinals repechage round, 4-0, but
had hoped to advance if OneWorld was disqualified. The team still has
a protest pending with the event's International Jury, but the jury
was not expected to exceed the arbitration panel's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The semifinals were scheduled to start Sunday, with OneWorld
meeting Prada and Switzerland's Alinghi meeting San Francisco's
Oracle BMW, but high winds postponed the racing until today.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a stack of affidavits and two days of hearings, the
decision turned on OneWorld's own admission of a seemingly
insignificant infraction. Ian Mitchell said that when he defected
from Team New Zealand to join OneWorld after the 2000 defense, he
brought along design information on a disk and an obsolete computer
that sat forgotten in his garage until the issue arose in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   OneWorld accepted the penalty bitterly, not only complaining about
its severity but blasting Sean Reeves, the New Zealand lawyer who led
the defections to Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "We respectfully submit that the America's Cup Arbitration Panel
has respectfully leveled an extremely harsh judgment against OneWorld
in response to the team's own voluntary disclosure," a statement
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst that should be said of us, beyond the fact that we
hired a man who turned out to be crooked and gave bad advice, is that
we have a designer who told us of an old backup disk and a
seven-year-old computer in his garage that he never used and OneWorld
never knew he had.</TE>
<TE>   "We have decided to proceed through the racing and hold our heads
high, knowing in our hearts that we assembled, with the exception of
Reeves, a fantastic team of good, talented people who came together
to win with a higher purpose."</TE>

<HD>Brooks Gets a Break</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>The New Orleans Saints had enough working in their favor that they
didn't need to risk further injury to Aaron Brooks.</LD>
<LD>   So they pulled their starting quarterback and finished off the
Baltimore Ravens without him.</LD>
<LD>   Deuce McAllister ran for 127 yards and three touchdowns, and the
Saints capitalized on numerous Raven mistakes in a 37-25 victory
Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Brooks left in the third quarter with New Orleans up, 20-7. He
bruised his right shoulder one week earlier against Tampa Bay, and
although he wanted to continue, Saint Coach Jim Haslett had seen
enough.</TE>
<TE>   "We just felt he was struggling a little bit in the third quarter,
and we decided to take him out," Haslett said. "He didn't have that
much practice this week, and it's tough on a quarterback when he
doesn't practice."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks was replaced by Jake Delhomme, who promptly helped the
Saints (9-4) convert a Jamal Lewis fumble into a McAllister
touchdown. He then led a 10-play drive that produced a field goal for
a 30-17 lead with 6:28 left.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks, who completed nine of 25 passes for 123 yards and a
touchdown, warned Delhomme earlier that he might be needed.</TE>
<TE>   "In the second quarter, he said to stay loose," Delhomme said.
"When he came out for halftime, he said stay loose. So I knew I'd be
going in."</TE>
<TE>   Delhomme completed seven of eight passes for 103 yards.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans blocked two punts, recovered three fumbles and twice
intercepted passes by Jeff Blake, who also lost a fumble.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, who started for New Orleans in 2000 and was a backup to
Brooks last season, completed 18 of 39 passes for 316 yards for
Baltimore (6-7).</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't make any turnovers, if we don't give them anything,
we win this football game," Blake said. "Everything they got, we gave
them. You give a team like that that type of field position, they're
going to beat you."</TE>

<LD>Were you a little chilly Sunday evening when temperatures in parts of
Los Angeles dipped into the 40s? Think of the fans and players for
the Green Bay Packers and Minnesota Vikings during Sunday night's
26-22 Packer victory at Green Bay, Wis., when the temperature at
kickoff was 11 degrees.</LD>
<LD>   What was the NFL thinking scheduling a night game at Lambeau Field
in December?</LD>
<LD>   The game between the border rivals marked the latest -- by 30 days
-- that the league had ever scheduled a night game in Wisconsin.</LD>
<TE>   The wind chill was 6 degrees at kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be just great. This is football weather, right?" said
Dennis Michels of Antigo, Wis. "But we're not going to take our
shirts off."</TE>
<TE>   A Packer fan refusing to take his shirt off? Sacrilege.</TE>
<TE>   Norma Cruz of Green Bay said she would have preferred a noon
kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   "For Green Bay, they should schedule day games," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Catheline of Chicago said it wouldn't have made much
difference.</TE>
<TE>   "It's only about 10 degrees warmer in the daytime," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda Krysvak, of North Aurora, Ill., whose family has had season
tickets since 1957, said this was nothing compared to some playoff
games -- the Ice Bowl in 1967 or the NFC championship in 1996, when
the temperature at kickoff was 3 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she was dressed in several layers and had heat packs in her
shoes. Reminding people everywhere of an annoying commercial from a
few years ago, Krysvak added: "If I fell down, I couldn't get up."</TE>
<TE>   Sean Lannan, who was born in Minneapolis, had two pair of wool
socks, two pair of long underwear, four shirts, a coat, gloves and a
hat.</TE>
<TE>   "The pain is now bearable, that's all," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he'd rather be in Green Bay than in the climate-controlled
Metrodome any day.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it. Being a football fan, it couldn't be better," Lannan
said. "It's the essence of football, sitting outside and enjoying the
game -- which I don't get to do being a Vikings' fan." He also
doesn't get to see a lot of wins by his team.</TE>
<TE>   Both teams practiced outdoors during the week in preparation for
the frigid night, although the Packers had several layers of clothing
Friday and Viking Coach Mike Tice made his players go out in short
sleeves so they would know exactly what it would feel like.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst thing about it is the commercial breaks," Packer safety
Darren Sharper mused. "Because we're out there in the middle of the
field and can't run to the heater."</TE>
<TE>   What a bunch of wimps.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dante Hall returned a punt and a kickoff for touchdowns in the
first half of Kansas City's 49-10 win over St. Louis, the first Chief
player to do both in the same game. Hall is the 20th player in NFL
history to return two kicks for scores in a game.</TE>

<KH>HOUSTON 24, PITTSBURGH 6</KH>
<HD>Texans Don't Need to Expand Offense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>No NFL team ever played worse on offense and won. What made the
difference was very few teams -- much less an expansion one -- have
played a game like this defensively.</LD>
<LD>   Aaron Glenn scored twice on long interception returns and the
Texans scored the first three defensive touchdowns in their history,
all off Tommy Maddox turnovers, to stun Pittsburgh, 24-6, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The Steelers (7-5-1) were 6-1-1 in their previous eight games, the
NFL's best record over that span except for Atlanta's 7-0-1, yet lost
to a first-year team that completed only three passes and had only
three first downs. The Texans were outgained, 422-47, the fewest
yards ever by a winning team in NFL history.</LD>
<TE>   "To hold a team to 40-some yards, that's incredible," Steeler
tackle Wayne Gandy said. "But to get 400 and some yards and still
lose? I've never heard of such a game."</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably, the Steelers lost to an expansion team in its first
season of existence for the third time since 1995. The Steelers lost
to Cleveland, 16-15, in 1999 -- only weeks after beating the Browns,
43-0 -- and to expansion Jacksonville in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not the typical expansion team," Glenn said. "We're not
going to lay down and say, 'Oh, we're not supposed to win, we're an
expansion team.' We have nothing to lose, we're trying to be a
spoiler."</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh's loss and Cleveland's last-play 21-20 win at
Jacksonville cut the Steelers' AFC North lead over the Browns to a
half-game.</TE>
<TE>   Maddox couldn't have had a much worse day in his first game since
being briefly paralyzed by a hit Nov. 17 in Tennessee, despite
throwing for 325 yards.</TE>
<TE>   His fumble was returned 40 yards for a touchdown by Kenny Wright
on Pittsburgh's first possession, and Glenn's 70-yard interception
return the next time the Steelers had the ball made it 14-0.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn sealed it with a 65-yard interception return touchdown --
the fifth of his career -- with 12:58 remaining in the game.</TE>

<HD>Violent Moment Changed 2 Lives</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You might know where they are now. Rudy Tomjanovich coaches the
Houston Rockets. Kermit Washington directs a charity called Project
Contact in Portland, Ore.</LD>
<LD>   You might remember where they were exactly 25 years ago when
Tomjanovich and Washington were NBA players.</LD>
<LD>   And if you were there at the Forum, when the Rockets played the
Lakers the night of Dec. 9, 1977, you might never forget it.</LD>
<TE>   Sometimes in sports, moments of great importance are distilled
into a simple descriptive term that makes them instantly
recognizable. For instance, Joe Montana's touchdown pass to Dwight
Clark became "the Catch." Originally, "the Catch" was made by Willie
Mays when he hauled in that booming World Series drive by Vic Wertz.
California's improbable five-lateral scoring play against Stanford is
"the Play."</TE>
<TE>   What happened that night 25 years ago is "the Punch."</TE>
<TE>   It is the most infamous punch in NBA history and it occurred at
the end of a play, when Tomjanovich came running up behind
Washington, who was scuffling with Rocket center Kevin Kunnert.
Washington turned and hit Tomjanovich squarely in the face with his
right hand that carried such power that Tomjanovich was out of action
for more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   The punch changed everything. Tomjanovich eventually returned to
the Rockets, but was never the same player. Washington was suspended
without pay -- and was never the same player.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, 25 years later, for a reporter who watched it all
happen, it is a memory that refuses to fade.</TE>
<TE>   It's sort of odd, what you can dredge up.</TE>
<TE>   Probably the sound, that's what comes first. The sound
Washington's fist made as it crushed part of Tomjanovich's skull. You
could hear it all the way up in the press box, halfway up the west
side of the Forum. There wasn't courtside seating for the media in
those days and reporters sat at a temporary working table.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in near darkness watching the court, it was almost like
watching a movie. Tomjanovich fell backward, his head bouncing off
the hardwood court. He started bleeding immediately and somebody
brought towels to mop up the blood.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, no one realized the consequences of the punch. Not
even Tomjanovich, who walked off the court holding a towel to his
head and believing he had only broken his nose. A few reporters left
their seats, took the back stairs down to the locker room level and
were stunned to see people preventing an angry Tomjanovich and an
equally enraged Washington from tangling again.</TE>
<TE>   Fights were not exactly new in the NBA and this one didn't seem so
much different. In fact, Houston's 5-foot-9 Calvin Murphy had been
involved in about half a dozen fights, usually because he was getting
elbowed in the head trying to get through screens. In the NBA,
Murphy's head was at elbow level.</TE>
<TE>   The way Murphy saw it, the best way to fight was to make it short,
which meant getting in the first punch.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy and Tomjanovich roomed together on the road and no two
players were closer, although they seemed to be an odd pair, the
trash-talking African American guy from Norwalk, Conn., and the
laid-back, 6-8 Polish guy from Hamtramck, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   When Murphy learned that doctors had told Tomjanovich in the
hospital that he could have died from the punch, Murphy cried.</TE>
<TE>   He never got into another fight.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe what got to him was finding out that Rocket trainer Dick
Vandervoort had covered the mirror in Tomjanovich's hospital room
with a towel so he wouldn't see how badly his face was damaged.</TE>
<TE>   Tomjanovich was never in another fight either, but the important
thing was that he did come back to play. He wore a clear, plastic
mask, and he still had his usual jump shot, angling the ball off the
glass. He was no longer as effective, though.</TE>
<TE>   Washington? His reputation was soiled. He bounced around and soon
was out of the league.</TE>
<TE>   These days, the NBA has some of the strongest rules to prevent
fights. Any player who leaves the bench to join in a fight is
penalized. The threat of automatic ejection, suspension and heavy
fines is surely a deterrent.</TE>
<TE>   Tomjanovich is a successful head coach with two NBA titles in
Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Washington is looking for a job. He runs the nonprofit project,
which raises money to set up free medical clinics in Africa.</TE>
<TE>   He and Tomjanovich have talked about what happened and have
established a relationship, but neither has forgotten his position
that night 25 years ago. Washington was only protecting himself and
Tomjanovich was trying to make peace.</TE>
<TE>   And a quarter of a century later, there is renewed interest in the
Rudy-Kermit incident, which is the subject of a new book by John
Feinstein.</TE>
<TE>   Its title? "The Punch."</TE>

<KH>TENNESSEE 27, INDIANAPOLIS 17</KH>
<HD>McNair Plays Through Pain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>If sore ribs and turf toe can't stop Steve McNair, the Indianapolis
Colts certainly didn't have much of a chance.</LD>
<LD>   McNair missed practice for a second week in a row because of pain
in his ribs. But he looked physically sound Sunday, completing 19 of
23 for 237 yards and a touchdown as the Titans beat the Colts, 27-17,
Sunday in a matchup of AFC South leaders.</LD>
<LD>   "To do what he did today and last week without the benefit of
practice is really unbelievable," Colt Coach Tony Dungy said.</LD>
<TE>   McNair completed 14 consecutive passes at one point, and kept
drives alive by scrambling for 49 yards despite turf toe on his right
foot.</TE>
<TE>   "It goes back to high school when my coach told me that when
you're in pain, you tend to stay more focused on what you have to
do," McNair said. "I took that to heart, and I think that's how I
play now."</TE>
<TE>   The victory gave Tennessee (8-5) -- which also got two rushing
touchdowns from Eddie George -- a sweep of its season series with the
Colts. The Titans have won seven of their last eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis (8-5) outgained Tennessee on offense, 389-348, but
202 of the Colts' yards came when they were trying to play catch-up.
Colt quarterback Peyton Manning, who will have some swelling in his
knee checked by a team doctor today, threw for 297 yards and one
touchdown but had three passes intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   Colt receiver Marvin Harrison, who dropped one pass in the end
zone, improved his reception total to 640 to break Raymond Berry's
franchise record.</TE>

<HD>Bruins Follow Where Kapono Leads for Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jason Kapono looked around half-empty Pauley Pavilion on Sunday and
thought, enough is enough.</LD>
<LD>   He had returned to UCLA for his senior year rather than jump to
the NBA because, in his words, "I haven't won anything." Never mind
that the Bruins reached the NCAA's round of 16 in each of his three
seasons.</LD>
<LD>   This season he had found out what not winning anything actually
feels like. The Bruins had dropped two exhibitions and their first
two regular-season games.</LD>
<TE>   Enough was enough.</TE>
<TE>   Kapono became a whirling dervish in a headband, equaling a career
high with 28 points to lead an 81-58 blowout of Long Beach State and
sparing the Bruins the ignominy of losing their first three for the
first time since 1940.</TE>
<TE>   The forward's trademark perimeter jumper was clicking. He made 12
of 19 shots, including four three-point field goals. But he was more
impressive in the paint, grabbing rebounds, making twisting layups
and aggressive putbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Kapono had seven of UCLA's 44 rebounds, including five on offense.
He had three of the Bruins' 20 assists. Afterward, instead of having
to explain a disheartening loss, he was able to joke about reaching
his career-high point total for the fifth time.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm like a credit card with a low limit, I max out at 28," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   His pre-holiday spree did enough damage to the 49ers (1-4), who
stayed even for 13 minutes before sinking. UCLA outscored them,
49-33, in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   It was all Kapono early. He had seven field goals in the first
half, when no other Bruin had more than one, and three times
converted offensive rebounds into baskets.</TE>
<TE>   "I was out there scrapping," he said. "I didn't want to lose
today."</TE>
<TE>   Kapono's energy proved infectious. The Bruins had 23 more rebounds
and 15 more assists than Long Beach, which shot 39.6% and made two of
15 three-point tries. Sharpshooting 49er guard Tony Darden made one
of six from long range and scored 14 points.</TE>
<TE>   The return of Ryan Walcott was another boost for the Bruins. The
sophomore point guard, who had sat out the first two games as a
penalty for playing in an exhibition during his redshirt year, made
up for lost time, notching a career-high seven assists with no
turnovers in 23 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "You could clearly see the impact of Ryan Walcott," Coach Steve
Lavin said. "He makes us a very quick team."</TE>
<TE>   Lavin utilized the quickness three minutes into the second half,
employing a full-court press that forced four 49er turnovers in three
minutes and triggered a 22-6 run.</TE>
<TE>   The sleepy announced crowd of 6,358 finally roared its approval
when a blocked shot by forward Dijon Thompson led to a three-point
shot by Kapono. T.J. Cummings, who made the assist rather than take a
contested shot, waved his arms in the air and bumped shoulders with
Kapono.</TE>
<TE>   "T.J. could have shot the ball, but he turned down an average shot
to get me a pure shot," Kapono said. "I was proud of him."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson did not start because a sprained right thumb had caused
him to miss two practices this week, but he grabbed nine rebounds, a
career high, in 24 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman center Michael Fey started for the first time and did
little, missing two shots and committing four turnovers. However, his
presence enabled Cummings to move from center to forward and
contribute 12 points and five rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "T.J. was patient," Lavin said. "He allowed the game to come to
him."</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Kapono reached out and grabbed it by the collar. Tired of
losing, tired of Pauley Pavilion feeling like a morgue, he made a
difference.</TE>
<TE>   "It finally looked like my old home court out there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And when the student section began chanting, "Ja-son Ka-po-no" in
the second half, it sounded like a home court too.</TE>
<TE>   "Jason realizes he's a senior and he needs to have a good season
for us to be successful," Lavin said. "He opens things up inside when
he aggressively catches and shoots. Defenses have to honor that."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>This is the new NBA, where video review is an option -- and sometimes
even mandatory. And this is new territory for the Lakers, who still
have to show us something even after producing one of the most
stirring victories in franchise history.</LD>
<LD>   Their impressive comeback from a 27-point fourth-quarter deficit
Friday against the Dallas Mavericks gave the appearance that they had
found their championship ways. Sunday's game against the Utah Jazz
was time to see if Friday was a fact or a fluke.</LD>
<LD>   So now, after working through a 110-101 victory over the Jazz, we
can offer the confirmation.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers are back. At least they're back to the method that
worked well enough to win 58 regular-season games last season.</TE>
<TE>   One quarter at peak level by them is enough to beat most NBA teams
on most nights. They can't be expected to produce another 44-15 super
quarter as they did Friday night against Dallas, but they did convert
that remarkable finish into a fast start Sunday, and that was all
they needed.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers came out and put together 12 solid minutes, shooting
56% from the field, recording assists on seven of their 10 field
goals. If they hadn't missed seven of their 13 free throws they could
have posted another 40-point quarter. They still outscored Utah,
34-21, giving them a 78-36 spread against their opponents over two
consecutive quarters.</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz outplayed and outscored the Lakers in two of the final
three quarters, but that wasn't enough. Not when Shaquille O'Neal is
setting up deep enough in the lane and getting high enough off the
ground to score 32 points with 11 rebounds and three blocked shots.
Not when Kobe Bryant is controlling the game like an upgraded, deluxe
version of Steve Nash, driving through the lane for layups and
creating shots for teammates like Brian Shaw (11 points).</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were good enough for just long enough -- and it was all
enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Like old times," Shaw said. "Like old times."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, it's a step," Coach Phil Jackson said. "We couldn't quite
sustain the effort. [The starters] should have been off the court the
last five minutes, but we couldn't sustain the effort."</TE>
<TE>   The important thing the Lakers did was sustain the momentum they
created Friday. A loss Sunday wouldn't have erased the memories of
that accomplishment, but it would negate the progress. The Lakers
simply need to win games: five more in a row to get above .500 and 41
of their remaining 60 to reach the 50 victories Jackson said they'll
need to be a playoff team.</TE>
<TE>   This victory really began in the unusually quiet locker room at
halftime Friday night, when they were 28 points behind the Mavericks.
Even the usually vocal guys were quiet. They all made the decision,
internally, that they would at least put up a better showing on
national television. Anything but the complete embarrassment they
displayed in the first half, which resulted in them being booed
louder than they ever had at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   As Shaw said, "We're not going out like that."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal has been jumping out on screen-and-rolls and defending
little guards like Steve Nash and John Stockton, something he
normally doesn't do until playoff time. Jackson has gone to his
veteran-heavy playoff rotation (say hello to the bench, Slava
Medvedenko).</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are playing seriously again.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew how we were going to come out," Bryant said. "I knew we
were going to play hard. Our defense tonight was really what keyed
it. But I know guys respond to momentum. It's an emotional game."</TE>
<TE>   Just being the Lakers won't be enough to win games anymore. As
they enter their fourth season with Jackson coaching essentially the
same personnel, the rest of the league is catching up to them the way
NFL defenses catch up to the latest offensive wrinkle.</TE>
<TE>   "What we've been doing over the last three years, I think in some
ways we've become predictable," Shaw said. "Teams are scouting us
better. They're daring us to do certain things. We have to be able to
execute that much more. Because Phil's not going to let us stray too
much away from this triangle and what he wants us to do out on the
floor."</TE>
<TE>   But they know that as long as they're getting the ball to Kobe and
Shaq, they'll be OK.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Utah hung around much longer than it should have on a night
Karl Malone made only three of 16 shots and looked all of 39 years
old. The Jazz appeared more fired up to take on the officials than
the Lakers, leading to first-quarter ejections for center Greg
Ostertag and Coach Jerry Sloan.</TE>
<TE>   But Andrei Kirilenko put up 30 points (it only seemed as if he had
30 by halftime) and creaky backup point guard Mark Jackson was the
quickest guy on the court at times and the Laker lead was as small as
three points in the final minute of the first half.</TE>
<TE>   So it was still a bit of a contest even though "we just played
real soft," Sloan said.</TE>
<TE>   (With Jim Mora off the scene, it's official: there's no coach
better to listen to after his team loses than Sloan. Other comments
on his squad: "We didn't deserve to win.... We have to have people
that play hard and who are interested in the game.... I didn't say
the game was unfairly officiated. I though we played unfairly for
anyone who had to pay the money to come see us play.")</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson was a little hard on his team too. But it's mostly
for show. Kind of like old times.</TE>

<HD>Gifford There for Friend</HD>
<DH>Former 'Monday Night' announcer will speak at funeral of
Arledge, his longtime colleague.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry Stewart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank Gifford and Roone Arledge were about as close as could be.
Gifford was among the few people outside Arledge's immediate family
who visited the former president of ABC Sports and ABC News regularly
before he died Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "I was closer to Roone than my own brother," Gifford said Friday.
"He was my boss, but he was my friend first."</LD>
<LD>   Gifford will speak at Arledge's funeral today at 10:30 a.m. at St.
Bartholomew's Church in New York.</LD>
<TE>   Gifford visited Arledge last Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday at New
York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. On Thursday, Arledge's
wife, Gigi, called to tell Gifford her husband had died.</TE>
<TE>   "When Gigi called, she didn't have to say anything," Gifford said.
"I knew he was gone."</TE>
<TE>   Gifford said Arledge had been battling prostate cancer for six or
seven years.</TE>
<TE>   "What a lot of people don't know is he had quadruple bypass heart
surgery on New Year's Day this past January," Gifford said.
"Considering that he was also battling the cancer, he came through
that pretty well."</TE>
<TE>   Gifford said he hadn't seen his friend during the Thanksgiving
holiday and when he came to the hospital Monday, Gigi told him he
wasn't in good shape.</TE>
<TE>   "I held his hand, but he wasn't really able to communicate,"
Gifford said. "But I stayed at the hospital to talk with Gigi."</TE>
<TE>   Gifford and Arledge played golf at Deepdale Golf Course on Long
Island every Friday until Arledge's failing health prevented him from
playing beyond the spring of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Gifford told Gigi a story from one of those outings, a few days
after Howard Cosell's funeral in April 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "We were talking about Howard as only two men who knew him well
could," Gifford said. "On this one hole, after I duck-hooked one into
the woods, I made a gesture up toward the sky and said, 'OK, Howard,
you got me.'</TE>
<TE>   "Then Roone also duck-hooked one into the woods, almost in the
exact same place I did. Howard got him too.</TE>
<TE>   "After that, we always referred to that hole as 'Howard's hole.'</TE>
<TE>   "Anyway, as I was finishing telling this story to Gigi, Roone
suddenly began to talk. I don't want to say exactly what he said, but
he essentially said he was playing better than me that day."</TE>
<TE>   Those were the last words Gifford heard from his friend of more
than 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you what a great friend he was," Gifford said. "Our
lives kind of paralleled one another's. We seemed to have the same
problems in our lives at the same time, and he was always one I could
confide in."</TE>
<TE>   Arledge put Gifford in the "Monday Night Football" booth in 1971,
and Gifford remained there until 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "The past couple of years, Roone and I had the time to spend a lot
of time together, and we did," Gifford said. "I'd visit him regularly
in the hospital and we'd often walk the halls and reflect on how
things were and how they are today.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a wonderful newsman and a wonderful human."</TE>
<TE>   Gifford also had some nice things to say about Gigi.</TE>
<TE>   "She was wonderful for Roone," Gifford said, "a pillar of strength
through all of this."</TE>

<HD>Notre Dame Adds Texas to Its List</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unranked Notre Dame won its third straight game over a ranked team,
upsetting No. 2 Texas, 98-92, Sunday in the championship game of the
BB&amp;T Classic at the MCI Center in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   In a matchup of two of the nation's best point guards, Notre
Dame's Chris Thomas got the better of Texas' T.J. Ford down the
stretch.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas finished with 19 points and eight assists and made two free
throws with 25 seconds left to give Notre Dame (8-1) a 96-92 lead.</LD>
<TE>   The Longhorns (5-1) erased a 13-point second-half deficit and led
by five with three minutes left, but Thomas' three-point basket with
2:06 left gave the Fighting Irish an 85-83 lead they never
relinquished.</TE>
<TE>   No. 8 Florida 68, South Florida 52 -- The Gators improved their
winning streak against nonconference opponents at home to 33. Over
the last three seasons, Florida (6-2) is 24-1 in December games. The
Bulls (4-1) were looking to open the season with five straight wins
for the fourth time in school history.</TE>
<TE>   No. 9 Maryland 93, George Washington 82 -- The Terrapins played
some long ball to beat the Colonials in the third-place game of the
BB&amp;T Classic at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland (4-2), which made only four of 17 three-point attempts in
an upset loss to Notre Dame on Saturday, was 12 of 17 against the
Colonials (3-3).</TE>
<TE>   Steve Blake had career-highs of 27 points and five three-pointers
and Drew Nicholas added 27 points to lead the defending national
champions.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska 80, No. 20 Minnesota 60 -- Andrew Drevo, a transfer from
Division II Morningside College, scored 10 points as the Cornhuskers
(3-3) took a 16-0 lead and never looked back at Lincoln, Neb. Drevo
finished with 27 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Gophers (4-1) missed their first five shots and committed five
turnovers before Scott Bauer scored 5:59 into the game to end the
drought.</TE>
<TE>   No. 21 Michigan State 79, Cleveland State 47 -- The Spartans held
the Vikings without a basket for the final 7:30 of the first half
during an 18-1 run as they took a 37-14 lead at East Lansing, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland State (4-4) ended the drought of nearly nine minutes
early in the second half and outscored Michigan State, 10-4, to pull
within 17 points. But the Spartans (4-2) responded with a 12-1 run to
take a 53-25 lead to regain control.</TE>

<HD>Davis Is the Latest Test</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers haven't exactly played their best defense against the
league's top guards. To be sure, the NBA is top-heavy with talented
guards who can turn opponents to mush with crossover dribbling and
slashing moves to the basket.</LD>
<LD>   But the Clippers' track record in the opening 20 games of the
season has been dismal, dating to opening night, when Ricky Davis of
the Cleveland Cavaliers scored 25 points against them.</LD>
<LD>   Kobe Bryant of the Lakers scored 33 against the Clippers. Jason
Kidd of the New Jersey Nets twice scored 35 points against them.
Orlando's Tracy McGrady scored 32 and 35. Houston's Steve Francis
scored 31, as did Sacramento's Bobby Jackson.</LD>
<TE>   Next: Baron Davis of the Hornets tonight at New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, a former UCLA standout, has a herniated disk that might
require surgery before season's end, however.</TE>
<TE>   Davis originally was scheduled to sit out for five games, but was
sidelined for only one last week. His streak of 262 consecutive games
to begin his NBA career ended when he sat out the Hornets' victory
against the Boston Celtics. But he has since played in three in a
row.</TE>
<TE>   Given that the Hornets played without Jamal Mashburn because of
health problems last season, the question of when to have surgery is
a difficult one for Davis and the team.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll leave it up to him," Hornet Coach Paul Silas said recently.
"But I hope [he doesn't need it]. That would really set him back and
set us back."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coincidence? A free agent at season's end, Elton Brand had 25
points and 13 rebounds Wednesday against Miami and tied his season
best with 26 points plus 17 rebounds Saturday against Minnesota.
David Falk, Brand's agent, watched both games at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Brand has scored 20 or more points in five consecutive games and
taken 12 or more rebounds in four in a row, raising his season
averages to 18.4 points and 12.1 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at New Orleans, 5:30 PST</TE>
<TE>   Site -- New Orleans Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KXTA (1150).</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Clippers 8-12, Hornets 15-6.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Hornets (2001-02) -- 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- This is the Clippers' first visit to play the Hornets at
New Orleans. The franchise relocated from Charlotte, N.C., during the
off-season. The Hornets have won their first 11 games at New Orleans,
but haven't been filling the 17,200-seat New Orleans Arena. Six of 11
home dates have attracted crowds of fewer than 14,000. Poor
attendance was one of the major reasons the league approved the
Hornets' move.</TE>

<HD>West Virginia Coach Is Angry at Notre Dame</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>West Virginia Coach Rich Rodriguez lashed out at Notre Dame after the
Fighting Irish accepted a berth in the Gator Bowl and denied the
Mountaineers a New Year's Day game.</LD>
<LD>   No. 15 West Virginia (9-3) will play unranked Virginia (8-5) in
the Continental Tire Bowl on Dec. 28 in Charlotte, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   The Irish got shut out of the bowl championship series after they
were routed by USC, 44-13, a week earlier, so Gator Bowl officials
chose Notre Dame rather than West Virginia.</LD>
<TE>   The Mountaineers normally would have gone to the Gator Bowl as the
second-place team in the Big East.</TE>
<TE>   The No. 11 Irish (10-2) settled for an invitation to play No. 17
North Carolina State (10-3) on Jan. 1 with a $1.6-million payout.</TE>
<TE>   The Continental Tire Bowl has a $750,000 payout, although West
Virginia will instead receive $1.85 million from the Big East as its
bowl share for finishing second.</TE>
<TE>   With Ken Haines, Continental Tire Bowl executive director
listening on a conference call, Rodriguez said something needs to be
changed about the way the Big East's bowl selections are made.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if slighted is the right word, but I do question
sometimes what is Notre Dame's affiliation with our league,"
Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame, an independent in football but a Big East member in
nearly every other sport, was added to the league's portion of the
BCS mix after the 1997 season.</TE>
<TE>   "All the athletic directors agreed to this," Big East spokesman
Rob Carolla said. The contract, which was recently renewed, runs
through 2005.</TE>
<TE>   "I know this agreement was made earlier," Rodriguez said. "I'm
just a football coach and our players are just players, but we don't
understand some of the political things. I don't understand why Notre
Dame is getting the best of both worlds.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Big East is a great league and we can stand on our
own. In my opinion, Notre Dame either needs to get in or get out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Timmy Chang completed 33 of 54 passes for 437 yards and led a
93-yard game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter to give Hawaii
a 41-40 victory over San Diego State late Saturday night in Honolulu.</TE>
<TE>   The victory gave the Warriors (10-3) their best record since 1992,
when they went 11-2.</TE>
<TE>   Lon Sheriff completed 31 of 47 passes for 420 yards and three
touchdowns for San Diego State (4-9).</TE>
<TE>   J.R. Tolver of the Aztecs caught 18 passes for 283 yards and two
touchdowns.</TE>

<KH>PHILADELPHIA 27, SEATTLE 20</KH>
<HD>Feeley, Defense Give One-Two KO Punch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>A.J. Feeley was good enough at quarterback, and the Philadelphia
defense turned in another solid effort.</LD>
<LD>   Duce Staley ran for 100 yards, Feeley, the third-string
quarterback, threw for 190 yards and two touchdowns, and the Eagles
intercepted three of Matt Hasselbeck's passes to beat the Seattle
Seahawks, 27-20, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "We played a solid game," linebacker Levon Kirkland said. "A lot
of people counted us out when Donovan McNabb went down, but this team
has proven we can win without him if we need to."</LD>
<TE>   Feeley's 20-yard touchdown pass to Todd Pinkston early in the
third quarter gave Philadelphia a 27-6 lead, and the Eagles (10-3)
held on for their fourth consecutive victory and seventh in the last
eight games.</TE>
<TE>   They're 3-0 without McNabb, the starting quarterback who has a
broken right ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "It just goes to show we're not a one-man team," Feeley said.</TE>
<TE>   The Seahawks (4-9) pulled to within 27-20 on Hasselbeck's 11-yard
pass to Jerramy Stevens with 45 seconds to play, but the Eagles
recovered Seattle's onside kick and ran out the clock.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle outgained Philadelphia, 367 yards to 316, but that was
aided by a late push.</TE>
<TE>   Hasselbeck threw for two touchdowns in the last 17 minutes, and
the Seahawks made things interesting for the second consecutive week.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't finish a game. Why is that?" defensive tackle Chad Eaton
said. "We've had two games coming down to an on-side kick, which
means we're getting better every single game. We just don't win."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia must wait at least one more week to clinch its second
consecutive NFC East title.</TE>
<TE>   Hasselbeck completed 24 of 45 passes for 223 yards with two
touchdowns against the league's No. 3-ranked defense.</TE>
<TE>   "We had opportunities in the red zone to come away with
touchdowns," Hasselbeck said. "They were good drives but we came away
with field goals. I had some interceptions that didn't help."</TE>
<TE>   Shaun Alexander had 123 yards in 17 carries, the first time in his
seven 100-yard rushing games that Seattle has lost.</TE>

<KH>NEW YORK GIANTS 27, WASHINGTON 21</KH>
<HD>Redskins Turn This One Over</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LANDOVER, Md.</DL>
<LD>The New York Giants nearly ran out of people to play defense Sunday,
so they had to use a castoff from the opposing team. All he did was
force the game-clinching turnover.</LD>
<LD>   Backup safety Kato Serwanga, released Monday from Washington's
injured reserve list and signed by New York on Wednesday, stopped a
potential game-winning drive when he stripped the ball from receiver
Darnerien McCants in the Giants' 27-21 victory over the Redskins.</LD>
<LD>   Cornerback Ralph Brown, forced into starting duty because of
injuries, had an interception and a fumble recovery in the first
half. Altogether, the Giants (7-6) forced five turnovers despite
playing without five defensive starters and kept their minuscule
playoff hopes alive</LD>
<TE>   "I was looking on the backs of the jerseys of a few guys to figure
out what the heck, who is this?" defensive end Michael Strahan said.
"Without those guys, we wouldn't have won today."</TE>
<TE>   Brown had two dazzling runbacks to set up touchdowns, Kerry
Collins completed 17 of 31 passes for 212 yards and two touchdowns,
and Cornelius Griffin had three of New York's six sacks and forced a
fumble as the Giants won for the first time in three games.
Washington is 5-8.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's counting us out, but we're still alive," said Coach
Jim Fassel, who had critics calling for his job last week. "It will
be over when we say it's over."</TE>
<TE>   The two second-half turnovers were huge tide turners. The Giants
had been sapped of momentum -- their 17-0 lead was down to 17-14 --
when Washington's Champ Bailey fumbled a punt. Two plays later, the
Giants scored on Tiki Barber's one-yard run, and a 36-yard field goal
by Matt Bryant padded the lead.</TE>
<TE>   But they needed one last big play. Serwanga, who was sidelined
with a knee injury all season before his unexpected release, came
through when he stripped McCants at the Giant 30-yard line with 3:59
to play.</TE>
<TE>   "Surreal would be a good word," Serwanga said, "because a lot has
happened. From injured reserve to a week later playing against a team
you were just hanging out with for two years -- all in a matter of 72
hours. That's a bit much for me."</TE>
<TE>   Collins said he hasn't even said hello to Serwanga.</TE>
<TE>   "He just started to put the milk and sugar in the coffee," Collins
said. "But the guy's out there, what can you say? We'll all talk to
him now."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants played without linebackers Mike Barrow and Dhani Jones
and cornerbacks Will Allen and William Peterson. Defensive lineman
Keith Hamilton is out for the season.</TE>

<HD>Tiger's Prowl Falls Short</HD>
<DH>After eight-shot lead is reduced to one by the host,
Harrington recovers to beat Woods by two strokes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Bonk</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How much of a lead do you have to have on Tiger Woods and still win?</LD>
<LD>   The answer is eight shots, or at least it came close to that on
Sunday at Sherwood Country Club, where Padraig Harrington took an
eight-shot lead over Woods after two holes, blew all of it but one,
and still hung on to win.</LD>
<LD>   For degree of difficulty, Harrington gets high marks for this
victory, and also a very high stack of dollar bills -- 1 million of
them.</LD>
<TE>   Sure, Harrington might have been breathing heavily by the end of
the day, but he squeezed out a two-shot victory over Woods in the
$3.8-million Target World Challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard somebody on the course say, 'He's getting in your head,'
" Harrington said of Woods. "Well, he's been there all day.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that Tiger was going to come at me. I knew I was going to
feel the pressure. I did always feel it was still in my hands, no
matter what Tiger did. I was in control."</TE>
<TE>   As far as comebacks go, this one was fun for everyone, with the
possible exception of Harrington, although it didn't come close to
Woods' victory at Pebble Beach in 2000 when he trailed Matt Gogel by
seven shots with seven holes to play.</TE>
<TE>   Woods never caught Harrington, but twice climbed to within one
shot on the back nine.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington started with a six-shot lead over Woods and still had a
three-shot lead with five to go, but double bogeyed the 14th when he
hit his second shot out of bounds and Woods found himself just one
shot behind.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a pretty good shot at it," Woods said. "Eight back, I got
it down to one, I gave myself an opportunity. I just hit a bad shot
at the wrong time."</TE>
<TE>   At the 16th, the last par five, Harrington made a birdie and Woods
fell two shots down even though he chipped in to save par after
pull-hooking his second shot 30 yards left of the green on top of a
hill.</TE>
<TE>   But Woods rolled in a 12-footer to birdie the 17th and the margin
was again one shot.</TE>
<TE>   That other bad shot Woods talked about was his second shot at the
18th when he missed the green and wound up with his only bogey of the
round.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington rolled in a short putt for par, signed for a one-under
71 and a 20-under total of 268, smiled broadly and waited for
somebody to hand him the $1-million winner's check. It's unofficial
money, but real nonetheless, the same as his victory, Harrington
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I count it in my official book as a win," he said. "Against
Tiger, against a world-class field. This will give me confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Woods made $500,000 as runner-up and donated the money to his
foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Woods had six birdies and a bogey and his 18-under total of 270
was actually three shots better than last year, when he finished with
a 64 and beat Vijay Singh by three shots.</TE>
<TE>   Because there was so much cash on hand and they needed to split it
only 16 ways, there really weren't any losers.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Rich Beem was five shots worse than anyone else, he
was the only player who failed to break par, and he still made
$130,000.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to say that's a bad week.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Davis Love III showed he knows how to make money on the
last day when he shot a 65. That moved Love up from eighth place,
which meant he gave himself a nice little raise of $150,000 and a
check for $300,000 for third place.</TE>
<TE>   Chris DiMarco also was effective, but he had a longer way to go
than Love because he started the day in 11th place. But when DiMarco
closed with a 64, he finished seventh, and that increased his prize
money from $142,500 to $170,000.</TE>
<TE>   Colin Montgomerie had a 67 and tied for fourth with Bernhard
Langer, who had a 69. They made $220,000 each.</TE>

<LD>Showing once again she's more comfortable coming from off the pace,
Madame Pietra was a dominant winner in the $73,210 Corona Handicap on
Sunday at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Carl Grether and trained by Howard Zucker, the 5-year-old
Roy mare and 7-5 favorite toyed with her five rivals for her second
victory in a row. Ridden by Patrick Valenzuela, Madame Pietra
completed the six furlongs in 1:09.</LD>
<LD>   Outrun early when Wild Tickle set the pace while engaged from the
outside by Channing Way, Madame Pietra made a big move around the
turn while wide to take the lead, and from there it was just a matter
of how big her winning margin would be. At the finish, she had 2 1/2
lengths on 5-2 second choice Habibti, who has lost seven in a row
since winning the Hollywood Starlet on Dec. 16.</LD>
<TE>   "Howie's done a heck of a job with her," Valenzuela said. "He's
taught her how to relax the first part of the race. She relaxed
behind the leaders today and when I asked her around the turn, she
really smoked."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After a lengthy struggle, trainers based in California finally
have an agreement for a cheaper workers' compensation insurance
package.</TE>
<TE>   Supported financially with cash and letters of credit by tracks
throughout the state, trainers have a new deal with American
International Group.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very gratifying that every segment of the industry got
behind this," Ed Halpern, executive director of the California
Thoroughbred Trainers, said in a prepared statement. "It was a
concerted effort. That's what got it done and represents a positive
step that should help to keep horsemen in California."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Composure, second to the unbeaten Storm Flag Flying in the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies on Oct. 26 at Arlington Park, will be
heavily favored against a small field in the $200,000 Hollywood
Starlet on Saturday at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Rmisvesta, Summer Wind Dancer, Watching You and Tizalovelylady are
the only others considered probable for the 1 1/16-mile race.</TE>

<HD>Sour Season for Long Beach Poly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly an hour had passed since Santa Ana Mater Dei upset top-seeded
Long Beach Poly, 21-20, Saturday in a Southern Section Division I
semifinal at Edison Field, yet Poly Coach Raul Lara lingered in the
Jackrabbit locker room.</LD>
<LD>   Seated amid the handful of grim players who remained, his faced
fixed in a glazed expression, Lara talked about how Poly completed "a
heck of a season" despite the devastating conclusion.</LD>
<LD>   "We got to go to Hawaii, beat Kahuku and won the Moore League
title," Lara said.</LD>
<TE>   Though he was sincere, Lara's words had a hollow ring to them.
Despite an eighth consecutive league championship, Poly, with an 11-2
record, completed its worst season since 1996, when it finished 9-4
after losing to Mater Dei in a semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   Poly's 2002 highlight reel includes a bushel of victories over
overmatched teams but few high-quality wins.</TE>
<TE>   The Jackrabbits, whose strength of schedule was rated 15th out of
the 24 Division I teams by calpreps.com, thought they had notched a
big victory over two-time defending Hawaii state champion Kahuku in
Week 2. But Kahuku went on to lose in the quarterfinals of the Oahu
Interscholastic Assn. playoffs and finished 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   Poly had a chance to make a statement three weeks later against
Concord De La Salle, the nation's top-ranked team, but fell flat and
lost, 28-7.</TE>
<TE>   The Jackrabbits went undefeated in Moore League play, but the
merit of that accomplishment is debatable. Moore League teams, with
the exception of Poly, compiled a 13-13-1 record against nonleague
opponents, including the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   In the first two rounds of the playoffs, the Jackrabbits rang up
convincing victories over Huntington Beach Edison and Rialto
Eisenhower -- teams having relatively down seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the game against unseeded Mater Dei, with a conclusion
that left Poly feeling empty.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even though Woodland Hills Taft's high-flying offense has scored
524 points -- an average of 40 a game -- it is an improved defense
that has carried the Toreadors to their second consecutive City
Section championship game.</TE>
<TE>   Never was that more apparent than in their 31-13 semifinal victory
over Venice.</TE>
<TE>   The Toreadors intercepted five passes, forced six turnovers and
held the Gondoliers to a season-low point total.</TE>
<TE>   Taft's defining performance was fueled by its secondary, which
dominated Venice quarterback Eddie Miller and his group of big-play
receivers. Miller, who came into the game with 3,665 yards passing,
completed 10 of 23 passes for 185 yards and gave up all five
interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "We just had to execute," said Taft defensive back Paul Pratt, who
had two interceptions. "We mostly played zone and I thought we could
have had a couple more [interceptions]. We wanted to force the
quarterback to make the throws."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Using a no-huddle, no-nonsense offense, Ventura St. Bonaventure
overcame its stiffest challenge since a Week 2 loss to Newhall Hart
by rallying for a 46-40 victory over Moorpark.</TE>
<TE>   The top-seeded Seraphs (12-1) bounced back from three 10-point
deficits and survived a wild final 18 1/2 minutes in which 42 points
were scored to advance to the Division IV championship, where they
will face third-seeded Westlake Village Westlake (11-2).</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Brian Stevens found Nick Pierson with two consecutive
touchdown passes in the second half, the second of which gave St.
Bonaventure the lead for good early in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Whitney Lewis also increased his production in the second
half, rushing for 60 yards, two touchdowns and two two-point
conversions after touching the ball only four times in the first
half.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis finished with four touchdowns -- three rushing and one
receiving -- as the Seraphs won their 15th consecutive postseason
game.</TE>
<TE>   St. Bonaventure, which won Division XI titles the last three
seasons, last lost a playoff game in 1998, when it was beaten by
Santa Monica St. Monica, 30-24, in a Division XI quarterfinal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Almost 24 hours after his decision to go for a late two-point
conversion backfired during a 29-28 loss to top-seeded Hacienda
Heights Los Altos in a Division VI semifinal, Tustin Coach Myron
Miller said he stood by his choice.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have the kicking game to go into overtime," Miller said.
"The best chance we were going to have was to go in from the
three-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   "The play was open, we just didn't execute it."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, tight end Chris Barrett stood alone in the end zone, but
Marquis Malcolm couldn't get him the ball after defender Brigham
Harwell stepped in front of him, delaying the pass. When Malcolm
finally released the ball, Caleb Flores stepped in front of Barrett
to make the game-saving interception.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Altos had a great field-goal kicker [Peter Suarez] and in
overtime, the kicking game becomes even more important," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt our best chance to win the game was on the three-yard line
right then and there. The kids would have mutinied if I had said to
go for one."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lancaster Paraclete found the move from Division XII to Division
XI a little unsettling after its six-year, 22-game postseason winning
streak was ended during a 41-17 loss to top-seeded Carpinteria.</TE>
<TE>   The Spirits, who had won five consecutive section titles entering
this season, lost to a senior-laden Carpinteria team that had the
benefit of playing powerhouse St. Bonaventure every year before the
Seraphs moved to Division IV this season.</TE>
<TE>   "They definitely had the competitive edge," Paraclete Coach Jeff
Cortez said of Carpinteria. "After the game, it felt kind of empty. I
was at a loss for words with our team."</TE>

<LD>   27 Consecutive victories for top-seeded Mission Viejo, which plays
second-seeded Newhall Hart -- owners of a 35-game unbeaten streak --
Saturday in the Division II championship. The game cannot end in a
tie.</LD>
<LD>   32 Years since the City Section championship game featured two
teams from the San Fernando Valley. In 1970, Granada Hills and
quarterback Dana Potter defeated San Fernando, 38-28. Top-seeded
Woodland Hills Taft plays sixth-seeded Lake Balboa Birmingham in the
final Friday night at the Coliseum.</LD>
<TE>   150 Career victories by Santa Ana Mater Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson

Division I semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   BIG WINNERS</TE>
<TE>   * Foothill running back Mike Liti had three touchdowns and 175
yards as the Knights defeated rival Orange El Modena, 45-7, in a
Division VI semifinal. Liti had 46 yards rushing against the

<LD>Fifty wins is out there, they think.</LD>
<LD>   It might not get the Lakers home-court advantage in the second
round. Or, for that matter, in the first.</LD>
<LD>   But having started their season with 13 losses in 20 games, and
standing this morning at 9-13, they'll have little choice but to
leave the big, impressive regular-season records to the Dallas
Mavericks and Sacramento Kings, if it is to be.</LD>
<TE>   "I told [the team] they have to win 50 games," Coach Phil Jackson
said Sunday night. "That's basically the parameters of the league. Or
60, or whatever you can win."</TE>
<TE>   Sixty appears out of reach.</TE>
<TE>   After a light practice Saturday that followed Friday night's
improbable victory over Dallas, Jackson said he assumed, or hoped,
there would be a carry-over, and the Lakers rolled from a 44-15
fourth quarter into a 34-21 first against Utah.</TE>
<TE>   "Some nights, against the best teams in the league, if you have an
emotional win like that it can lead to an emotional lift," Jackson
said. "[But] that's not going to get us by in January."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant, who strained the right side of his groin Friday night
and nearly didn't make it to the end against Dallas, said he was
better by Sunday, and should be better still by Tuesday's game at
Golden State.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't really put it in full fourth or fifth gear," he said,
"but it was well enough to play well."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's preferred first five -- Shaquille O'Neal, Samaki Walker,
Rick Fox, Derek Fisher and Bryant -- started together for the first
time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson also tightened his rotation -- Robert Horry, Brian Shaw
and Devean George had the big minutes off the bench -- and Slava
Medvedenko and Mark Madsen did not play.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mexican league championship race was reduced to four teams Sunday
on an afternoon of playoff upsets and surprises.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest upset came at Azteca Stadium in Mexico City, where
Santos Laguna shocked defending champion Club America, 2-1, and
ousted it from the tournament, 5-4 on aggregate, after the teams had
tied the first game of the quarterfinal series, 3-3.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest surprise came after Toluca had shut out Chivas of
Guadalajara, 3-0, reversing an earlier 2-1 setback to also advance to
the semifinals. Toluca Coach Wilson Graneolatti quit the team in
order, he said, to preserve his "dignity."</LD>
<TE>   Also reaching the final four, but without similar fireworks, were
UNAM, which edged Cruz Azul, 3-2 after a 0-0 tie in the first game,
and Morelia, which completed a 7-2 aggregate rout of UAG with a 4-1
victory in the second game.</TE>
<TE>   The news was being made by Santos Laguna and Graneolatti, however.</TE>
<TE>   The latter said he was angry at the attempt by Rafael Lebrija,
Toluca's president, to bring former coach Ricardo Lavolpe, now
Mexico's national team coach, back for Sunday's game after Toluca had
lost the first leg of the quarterfinal series at Guadalajara.</TE>
<TE>   "I've stopped being the coach and I'm doing it for my dignity,"
Graneolatti said after Toluca had clinched its semifinal place with
goals in the final 16 minutes from Salvador Carmona, Jose Cardozo and
Vicente Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   "I took the decision before the start of the match. I don't want
to lose my dignity. I've got nothing against the club."</TE>
<TE>   Club America, meanwhile, was sent reeling by a first-half goal
from Mexico national team striker Jared Borgetti and it fell further
behind when German Villa accidentally put the ball into his own net.</TE>
<TE>   A late penalty kick by Cuauhtemoc Blanco was not enough to save
the defending champions.</TE>
<TE>   Brazilian Final</TE>
<TE>   Santos overcame the difficulty of having to play its "home" half
of the Brazilian championship final at its opponent's stadium Sunday
as it defeated Corinthians, 2-0, in the first game of the two-game
final in Sao Paulo, Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   Alberto gave Santos the lead in the 15th minute off a pass from
Diego, and the underdogs doubled their advantage two minutes from the
end when Renato scored off a pass from Robinho.</TE>
<TE>   Santos was forced to play the game at the Morumbi stadium because
its own Vila Belmiro stadium holds 5,000 fewer fans than the 25,000
minimum required by the Brazilian soccer federation for championship
matches.</TE>
<TE>   Moroccan Triumph</TE>
<TE>   Wydad Casablanca became the first Moroccan team to win the African
Cup Winners Cup on Sunday and thereby set the stage for the North
African nation to sweep both of the continent's top club prizes.</TE>
<TE>   Wydad, which won the first match of the two-match final, 1-0, in
Casablanca, lost the second, 2-1, Sunday to Asante Kotoko of Ghana in
front of 80,000 in the Ghanaian city of Kumasi, but Mustapha Talha's
away goal was enough to earn Wydad the title.</TE>
<TE>   Raja Casablanca can give Morocco the sweep if it defeats Zamalek
of Egypt on Friday in Cairo in the second game of the African
Champions Cup final.</TE>
<TE>   El Salvador Wins</TE>
<TE>   El Salvador defeated Mexico, 4-3 on penalty kicks, after the teams
had played to a 1-1 tie after 120 minutes in the final of the XIX
Central American and Caribbean Games Saturday at Estadio Cuscatlan in
San Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   Rafael Marquez put Mexico in front in the 15th minute, but Josue
Galdamez tied the game during injury time at the end of the first
half. Missed penalty kicks by Mexico's Luis Perez and Juan Carlos
Cacho then handed the Salvadorans their first soccer gold medal at
the Games since 1954.</TE>

<HD>Toledo Facing a Fateful Day</HD>
<DH>UCLA coach meets today with athletic director after
uncertain status contributes to team getting a lesser bowl bid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA is headed for a town that will take a bet on anything, but
wagers on whether Bob Toledo will be back for another season had
better be laid quickly.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruin coach of seven years is expected to learn his fate today
in a meeting with Athletic Director Dan Guerrero.</LD>
<LD>   Uncertainty surrounding the coaching job might have cost UCLA a
better bowl bid than the one it accepted Sunday. The Bruins will play
in the Las Vegas Bowl against New Mexico on Christmas Day.</LD>
<TE>   A 48-27 loss Washington State on Saturday left UCLA with a 7-5
record, 4-4 and in a four-way tie for fourth place in the Pacific 10
Conference. The Bruins were passed over by the Holiday Bowl (which
took third-place Arizona State), the Sun Bowl (which took 4-4
Washington) and the Insight Bowl (which took 4-4 Oregon State).</TE>
<TE>   Holiday and Insight bowl officials indicated that the prospect of
inviting a team with a lame-duck coach was a consideration in
bypassing UCLA, although the school's reputation for not bringing
many fans to road games was a bigger factor.</TE>
<TE>   The Sun Bowl did not want the Bruins because they played in the
game recently, in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea on the decision-making process" of bowl officials,
Toledo said. "I do know it's been very difficult for our team. There
is a lot of doubt and uncertainty."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo has a record of 49-32, but is 24-24 since a 20-game winning
streak and Pac-10 titles in 1997-98. UCLA has lost four in a row to
rival USC, and the 52-21 defeat to the Trojans Nov. 23 prompted loud
calls for a coaching change.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero, in his first year at UCLA after 10 years as athletic
director at UC Irvine, has not tipped his hand. He has refused
interview requests since the USC game, prompting sources at Irvine to
believe he is poised to make a change.</TE>
<TE>   "When he dropped out of sight for a while, he was getting ready to
fire somebody," said one person close to Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   After the loss to Washington State, Guerrero would not give Toledo
a vote of confidence, saying he had not made a decision. Toledo is
uncertain whether his boss will continue in an evaluative mode during
their meeting or simply hand him either a contract or a pink slip.</TE>
<TE>   Another course of action could be to demand that the coach make
changes on his staff, including hiring somebody to take over
play-calling.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to the meeting with Dan and coming to a
decision," Toledo said. "He either already knows what he wants to do
or is close."</TE>
<TE>   Given an opportunity, Toledo plans to fight for his job.</TE>
<TE>   "We won three in a row before losing our last two, but
unfortunately that's not what people remember," he said. "We won two
championships and people expected an awful lot after that."</TE>
<TE>   Does he believe losing his job would be unfair?</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I do," he said. "To do what we've done this season
with so many freshmen playing, I think it says something about the
future of this football team. It's sad this has gone on. It's hurt
us. It's hurt our recruiting, it's hurt my coaching staff and it's
hurt the players."</TE>
<TE>   While no Bruin players have said their coach should be fired,
several are noncommittal. Others back Toledo.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was my decision, I'd keep him," senior cornerback Ricky
Manning Jr. said. "He's got a chemistry built here that will lead to
winning seasons. He's a good coach and the program is rising."</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero has made it clear that his expectations for a coach go
beyond wins and losses. He expects every Bruin player to give maximum
effort at all times. Toledo believes his team has done so despite
one-sided losses to clearly superior USC and Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   "[Guerrero] refers to 'busting it,' and I think we've done so,"
Toledo said. "We played hard every game. There was not a game our
kids laid down. We put people in the seats and off the field our kids
improved tremendously."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the decision, Toledo wants to coach in the Las Vegas
Bowl, which provides an $800,000 payout to UCLA. His friend, former
Bruin assistant Rocky Long, is the New Mexico coach. UCLA has not won
a bowl game since beating Texas A&amp;M in the 1998 Cotton Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids will be excited to play in a bowl game, that's all that
matters to them," Toledo said. "It's a great reward, especially for
the seniors. I feel very strongly about that. This team is a family."</TE>
<TE>   His own family is handling the torturous uncertainty. Toledo's
wife, Elaine, tearfully thanked Bruin supporters while holding one of
her granddaughters near the locker room Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA Chancellor Albert Carnesale had private words with Toledo and
gave him a warm embrace.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it was a goodbye hug should be determined today.</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>Patterson Ready and Waiting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His baseball cap was askew, but Andre Patterson said his grades are
in order.</LD>
<LD>   The sophomore forward watched in street clothes as UCLA defeated
Long Beach on Sunday, and in the locker room afterward said he is
excited about the prospect of rejoining the team in time to play
Northern Arizona on Dec. 17.</LD>
<LD>   Patterson said he earned two A's and one C at Santa Monica City
College this fall, which exceeds the B-average he needed for
reinstatement at UCLA. The term at Santa Monica ended Friday and he
officially receives the grades today.</LD>
<TE>   However, his academic hearing to be reinstated is not until Dec.
16 because the UCLA quarter extends through this week.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel good about it," he said. "I want to play basketball."</TE>
<TE>   Patterson, a 6-foot-7 power forward, could add much-needed
rebounding and interior defense. He averaged 2.3 points and 2.1
rebounds in nine minutes a game last season but academically had
difficulty. He regained ground during the summer, getting B-minuses
in four classes at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "Andre has worked extremely hard," Coach Steve Lavin said. "He
could make a big difference for us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jon Crispin came to UCLA with a reputation for being an accurate
long-range shooter. Although he sat out last season under transfer
rules, the former Penn State guard showed as much during practices.
Sunday, he finally got to display his touch in a game, making three
of six from three-point range and scoring 11 points in 13 minutes
against Long Beach State.</TE>
<TE>   "I've really tried getting beyond being passive, without forcing
shots," he said. "It's a tough thing to balance when you're playing
limited minutes."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA is 9-0 against Long Beach State, but having a game at Pauley
Pavilion was a new experience for first-year 49er Coach Larry
Reynolds.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up in L.A. and was a big Bruin fan," he said. "It was
special to me to come out of the locker room and see Coach [John]
Wooden sitting in the stands."</TE>
<TE>   However, he wasn't especially pleased with how his team played in
the 81-58 loss. "I thought we could have hung in there longer," he
said. "In the second half, one mistake just got piled on top of
another."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The 23-point margin of victory was the Bruins' largest since a
93-65 victory over Villanova on Jan. 13, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   *UP NEXT</TE>
<TE>   UCLA vs. Portland, Saturday, 5 p.m. -- Portland Coach Michael
Holton is a former Bruin player and longtime Bruin assistant. The
Pilots are 3-2 after losing to Oregon State on Saturday.</TE>

<KH>USC REPORT</KH>
<HD>Miami Nice for Surprised Trojans</HD>
<DH>USC had expected to play in Sugar Bowl, but is happy for
the opportunity to play in major bowl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC players and coaches awoke Sunday morning with sweet thoughts
about their place in the bowl championship series picture.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans believed they were bound for New Orleans and a Sugar
Bowl date with Southeastern Conference champion Georgia.</LD>
<LD>   But Orange Bowl organizers opted to defy what passes for
convention in the BCS, and made a game that pits fifth-ranked USC
(10-2) against third-ranked Iowa (11-1) on Jan. 2 at 5 p.m. PST at
Pro Player Stadium in Miami.</LD>
<TE>   "Going to Miami is a little bit of a shocker," senior offensive
lineman Zach Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   It will be the first Orange Bowl appearance for USC and Iowa,
co-champions of the Pacific 10 and Big Ten conferences, respectively.
Iowa Coach Kirk Ferentz called it a Rose Bowl-style matchup on "the
wrong coast."</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll said he was looking forward to playing the
Hawkeyes in the only bowl game on Jan. 2.</TE>
<TE>   "It just seems like one more great spotlight moment for us," said
Carroll, whose team opened the season with a prime-time game against
Auburn and finished it in prime time against Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we'll be awed by it. I think we'll feel comfortable
in the setting even though it's a long way from home."</TE>
<TE>   Junior cornerback Marcell Allmond said Trojan players did not have
a preference between the Orange and Sugar bowls.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a BCS bid; you can't be choosy," he said. "A bowl is a
bowl and I'm happy to be in one of the biggest. I just want to play
football."</TE>
<TE>   USC was assured of a BCS bowl when top-ranked Miami defeated
Virginia Tech on Saturday and advanced to the national championship
game against Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl, thereby solidifying the
Trojans' hold on the No. 4 spot in the BCS rankings. The Sugar Bowl
appeared to be the Trojans' probable destination after Washington
State secured the Rose Bowl berth with a victory over UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   But Orange Bowl organizers could not resist a matchup between
teams ranked fourth and fifth in the BCS standings and featuring
Heisman Trophy candidates. USC quarterback Carson Palmer, Iowa
quarterback Brad Banks and certain attendance by tens of thousands of
sun-starved Hawkeye fans helped sway Orange Bowl officials to act on
a provision in the BCS agreement that allowed them to take USC and
Iowa as at-large teams.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't realize the Orange Bowl would exercise their option to
go and get us," Carroll said. "The fact that they did, I think, was a
big-time move by them. It's pretty special."</TE>
<TE>   USC is 6-2 against Iowa, but has not played the Hawkeyes since
defeating them, 55-0, in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans, who have a seven-game winning streak, meet an Iowa
team that has won nine consecutive games since a nonconference loss
to Iowa State on Sept. 14.</TE>
<TE>   The Hawkeyes have not played since defeating Minnesota on Nov. 16.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a great opportunity for our team to relax and enjoy what
they worked so hard to accomplish over the course of the regular
season," Ferentz said. "We got back to work this past Monday. I'm
confident that we have a good plan and if we follow it, we'll be
ready to go when the New Year comes around."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll, who coached defensive backs at Arkansas when the
Razorbacks upset Oklahoma in the 1978 Orange Bowl, said the Jan. 2
game would allow most Trojan players to spend the holidays with
family. USC will probably depart Los Angeles for Florida on Dec. 26.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be the only game in town and, hopefully, we'll put together
a game that will be the best game of the New Year's holiday," Carroll
said. "I hope everyone celebrates this season by going with us and
spending New Year's in Miami."</TE>
<TE>   Said Allmond: "We have enough senior leadership to go in there and
handle our business. This is another chance to show people what USC
is all about."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman linebacker Oscar Lua suffered a torn anterior cruciate
ligament in his right knee and will have surgery in the next week or
two, Carroll said. Lua, who backed up senior Mike Pollard, was hurt
during practice Saturday. He will attempt to return by training camp
in August. Carroll said weakside linebacker Melvin Simmons could back
up Pollard.... Those interested in purchasing tickets and/or travel
packages to the Orange Bowl can do so online at USC's Web site:
www.usctrojans.com. Tickets also can be purchased through the
school's ticket office. Information: (213) 740-4672.</TE>

<DL>HARTFORD, Conn.</DL>
<LD>The USC women's basketball team had hoped at this point in the
schedule it would be competitive enough for a test against defending
national champion Connecticut.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday, the Trojans learned they weren't close, getting rolled by
the third-ranked Huskies, 68-44, before 16,294 at the Hartford Civic
Center.</LD>
<LD>   The Huskies (7-0) had no difficulty claiming their 46th
consecutive victory, which tied Tennessee for the second-longest
streak in women's college basketball history. (The record-holder is
Louisiana Tech, which won 54 consecutive games from 1980-82.)</LD>
<TE>   USC's shooting woes, which have dogged the team this season, sank
to record levels against Connecticut. The Trojans (4-3) made 12 of 66
shots, tying the team record for fewest field goals, set against
Oregon State on Jan. 29, 2000. The Trojans' field-goal percentage
(18.2%) eclipsed the former mark of 24%, logged against Washington in
1990.</TE>
<TE>   Take away the totals of Ebony Hoffman (who made six of 17 shots
and had 22 points and 14 rebounds) and Aisha Hollans (four of 16, 11
points), and the rest of the Trojan roster was a combined two for 33.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe we shot 18% and only lost by [24]," USC Coach
Chris Gobrecht said. "Just imagine how good we'd be defensively if we
could knock some shots down."</TE>
<TE>   It was the third time this season the Trojans have lost to a
top-10 team by double digits. They had reason to feel better about
their efforts in the losses to Kansas State and Notre Dame. There
wasn't much upside to Sunday's defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought [Connecticut] was obviously more aggressive than we
were, and a lot more physical," Gobrecht said. "The only real
physical player we have is Ebony; for the most part she did her job.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're going to play at this level, we really have to step up
our physical toughness. We've been fine hanging with the teams
[ranked] 15 and down. But when we play the top 10 we need to step up
our toughness, mentally and physically."</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma wasn't gushing about his team,
either. Even though Connecticut led by as many as 26 and got 24
points, 14 rebounds and six blocks from star Diana Taurasi and 11
points from freshman Willnett Crockett, Auriemma found plenty of
fault with his team, starting with 30 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the most god-awful exhibition of basketball I have ever
witnessed," Auriemma said. "I figured their defense was probably
responsible for about 10 of our turnovers. You could make a case that
there was a foul on every possession ... people were holding,
grabbing, pushing and shoving and it was tough to get anything done
out there.</TE>
<TE>   "But we turned it over 30 times, who does that? [Many] were mental
mistakes, the wrong pass at the wrong time. There's no explanation
for it."</TE>
<TE>   It would be ill-advised to expect this Connecticut squad, with no
seniors, to approach the level of last season's 39-0 team.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some things remain the same. The young Huskies can still chew
up and spit out teams as they did against USC.</TE>
<TE>   The game momentarily was close. A three-foot hook shot by Kim
Gipson at the 11:43 mark drew the Trojans within 18-12. But USC,
which never led, would make only two more field goals in the half as
Connecticut carved up the Trojan defense with pinpoint passing,
offensive rebounds, accurate shooting (making 13 of 25), and
Taurasi's ability to drive past any defender for either layups or
fouls.</TE>
<TE>   By halftime the Huskies were breezing, 37-19. The Trojans were
rushing shots, missing shots (seven of 31) and not taking full
advantage of Connecticut miscues.</TE>
<TE>   "None of us were really into the game, myself included," Hoffman
said. "We had a size advantage, but they wanted it more. We basically
didn't have any heart.</TE>
<TE>   "We believed we could come in and have a game, but they are at a
level a lot higher than us."</TE>
