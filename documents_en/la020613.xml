<LD>MORAL HAZARD</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Kate Jennings</LD>
<TE>   Fourth Estate</TE>
<TE>   180 pages, $21.95</TE>
<TE>   "Cath. That's my name. At the time of the events I am recounting,
I was in my forties: bedrock feminist, unreconstructed
left-winger.... [My beliefs] were not so much unexamined as untested.
You can guess them: affirmative action, a woman's right to choose, a
judicious redistribution of wealth, parity for everyone in all
things." This crisp self-presentation, in the opening pages of Kate
Jennings' deftly titled new work, "Moral Hazard," flags the topic
about to unfold: the testing of one woman's staked-out, firmly held
set of principles.</TE>
<TE>   We never learn Cath's last name, nor much about her life prior to
"the events," save that like author Jennings, Cath hails from
Australia, moved to New York and has worked successfully as a
freelance journalist. Cath is also lately and happily married to a
gentle-spirited artist named Bailey.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty-five years older than me, imprudent as I, but who cared?
He saw the point of me.... He surrounded me with warmth." The reader
is trusted to fill in the blank past: 40-odd years of conscious
privilege, brimming with stimuli, low on pain. Emblematic, perhaps,
of the reader's own class and time. And if so, it is all the more
frightening to see this familiar world torn in two, its tent poles
and fabric destroyed in the few seconds it takes for a pen-fiddling
neurologist to sigh: "You will have to say good-bye to the man you
love." This could happen to us.</TE>
<TE>   Alzheimer's disease, dementia, "gaga, away with the pixies.... "
Those are all aliases for the random, baleful blow of fate that has
struck Bailey, the beloved and loving husband. Alzheimer's strikes
even harder at Cath, or so she seems to feel as the shared ordeal
drags on and deepens. From a certain point onward his panic will blur
and evaporate along with memory; she must accompany her man's
unraveling with eyes wide open.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with geometrically mounting medical costs, Cath quickly
hires a nurse's aide and signs on to a 9-to-5 job with benefits, as a
speechwriter for execs of a Wall Street private investment bank.
"Niedecker Benecke.... You will know it: not quite top tier." (This
cognoscente's "you will know," apropos of some utter fiction, is one
of the narrator's less appealing mannerisms, along with "dear reader"
and a penchant for emphatic italics.) To play mouthpiece for the
bosses ranks as a first giant step toward ethical meltdown, at least
for any woman bold enough, as Cath is, to equate American
corporations per se with "Nazi-occupied France, the Vichy
government.... In corporations there are out-and-out collaborators.
Opportunists. Born that way. But most of the employees are like the
French in the forties.... Hunkering down. Turning a blind eye."</TE>
<TE>   Given Bailey's situation, Cath understandably grants herself
absolution. However, a practical hazard remains: her sheer
cluelessness about finance, market economics, statistics--all that
stuff she's expected to eloquently represent. To the rescue comes a
disaffected risk analyst. Cath and Mike share extended "ciggie
breaks." "Beanpole Mike, angular and awkward as Abe Lincoln" and a
potential romantic entanglement, gladly plays Virgil, a guide through
the Hades of high finance. They're wonderfully matched: Expert Mike
is as prone to pages-long, righteous fulminations as is Cath, the
eager learner. Quickly and early, the narrative's balance, as
measured by word count, tips away from Bailey's poignant down-spiral,
and toward yet another brittle and sarcastic sendup of blinkered
corporate perfidy.</TE>
<TE>   Heads up, class! Whip out your PDAs and styluses and define the
following concepts: 1) hedge fund; 2) financial derivative; 3)
convergency trading. Drawing a blank? That could be because these
terms, though central to the spare and linear plot of "Moral Hazard,"
are never adequately defined. Instead we have an author's note: "For
readers unfamiliar with finance and wanting to know more than a short
novel can bear, I recommend.... " Poor compensation. Surely the book
could have been leavened with a handful of rough, robust definitions,
without incurring accusations of verbosity.</TE>
<TE>   Cath keeps her emotions on a tight leash. "I'd rather eat garden
worms than be earnest or serious. Or sentimental." Hard-edged
minimalism delivers real pathos in the scenes devoted to Bailey,
through the sheer horror of his disease and of the even greater
"moral hazard" Cath confronts in his plight.</TE>
<TE>   But where character development and background are throttled,
motivation suffers. The reader can only guess why Mike's vehement
opinions seesaw, what prompts Cath's periodic bouts of "sucking-up,"
why Mike eventually plumps for vindictive silence and who poor Bailey
was in better days. Presented without family or real friends, the
couple appears oddly marooned. And the cadre of bosses, while often
amusing, comprises mere cartoons.</TE>
<TE>   The fall through the trapdoor of fate. The parallel construction
of private moral hazard unfolding in tandem with free-market
turpitude. Reference to an actual '90s hedge fund
comeuppance--altogether, an intriguing premise for a novel. "Moral
Hazard" reads as its promising draft.</TE>

<LD>Warm-season lawn grasses such as Bermuda, St. Augustine and zoysia
should be looking their best. If yours is not, give it a thorough
soaking, then fertilize and water again. If it doesn't green up in a
few weeks, it may be time to replace the lawn (it won't live forever)
or have a professional lawn care company renovate it with power
tools. This is a good month for either job.</LD>
<LD>   "June drop" is the disturbing but natural tendency for fruit trees
to thin themselves by dropping part of their crops. You will probably
have to do additional thinning to keep fruit from touching and any
overladen branches from breaking. Water only every three to four
weeks to discourage fruit splitting.</LD>

<LD>Can You Kazoo?</LD>
<LD>   The kazoo may be the most popular musical instrument in the world.
That's because anyone can play it. Kazoos come in many shapes and
sizes, but the most popular kazoos look like the ones shown here.</LD>
<LD>   A kazoo has no keys or strings. So how does it make music? The
kazoo won't make any music unless you hum into it. Kazoos have a tiny
membrane inside that vibrates when you hum into the large end. But
you can't just blow into it! You have to hum. Once you've started
humming, you can then play a song just by going "toot-toot-toot" into
the kazoo.</LD>
<TE>   The earliest kazoo was an African instrument called the mirliton.
African villagers made them out of cow's horns and the membrane was
made of spider's eggshells! Mirlitons were used at special ceremonies
as a way for the villagers to change their voices in order to keep
evil spirits from recognizing them, sort of like voice masks. In the
1840s an African American by the name of Alabama Vest got the idea to
make the first American kazoo.</TE>
<TE>   Today, kazoos are made by the Original American Kazoo Co. in Eden,
N.Y. It is the only metal kazoo factory in the world. There is even a
kazoo museum there.</TE>
<TE>   At Symphony in the Glen's special Father's Day concert Sunday, you
and your dad can get a free kazoo, join the Symphony in the Glen
Kazoo Band and play a special piece with the orchestra. The
"kazooing" starts at 1:30 p.m. The concert begins at 3. For more
information, call (213) 955-6976 or visit us at www.symphony
intheglen.org.</TE>
<TE>   This Learning Link was written by Arthur B. Rubinstein, music
director of Symphony in the Glen, located in Griffith Park, near the
merry-go-round. To find parking, follow the blue and white signs.</TE>

<LD>Maxine Rudoff's students at Roscomare Road Elementary in Los Angeles
have these suggestions and comments on teasing.</LD>
<LD>   * Once my sister had her friends over and she was constantly
calling me "stupid, dork, idiot," and names like that. She did that
to be mean and cool to her friends. I just ignored her. I think if
you ignore the person that's teasing you, they'll stop. They just do
it because they are jealous and want attention. (Jenna, 8)</LD>
<LD>   * Once when I was in kindergarten someone teased me. I ignored
them completely and walked away. Try to avoid bullies. If they say
mean things, walk away. Later in their lives, bullies will have a
hard time. (Dylan, 9)</LD>
<TE>   * I am the oldest in my family so I do not really get teased at
home. But I get teased at school by my friends. They make up things
like the "Who Hates Claudia Club." So now they are not really my
friends. I told my mom and she said they were jealous, so I forgot
about it. (Claudia, 9)</TE>
<TE>   * Once when my sister teased me I just said, "Whatever you say to
me bounces off me and sticks to you like glue. So there." (Amy, 9)</TE>
<TE>   * In the second grade my brother called me all sorts of names like
dork, doofus, stupid, numskull, birdbrain and crybaby. I felt so mad
I could just beat him up! I just walked away and ignored him.
(Steven, 9)</TE>
<TE>   * Last year I was never good at races. I always came in last
place. This one boy every day would challenge me to a race. I said
"yes" thinking if I practiced more, I would get faster. But instead,
I stayed just the same. He would call me "slowpoke" and say that I
was the slowest person in school. Then one day he started calling me
names again. That was enough! I had a big surge of temptation to call
him names back. Instead, I swallowed my temptation and walked away.
That's what people should do. (Maddie, 9)</TE>

go up to the electronics department to look for something to buy with
my gift certificate? You can show Wendy the dollhouses, and then we
can get home in time for you to see the ballgame."</LD>
<LD>   "That's not a bad idea," said Riley's father, as he started
chasing after Riley's little sister, Wendy. She was already headed
for the toys.</LD>
<LD>   " 'Bout time we got rid of those two," Sam said as he walked
toward the escalators. "Your sister is even worse than mine."</LD>
<TE>   "She's not so bad," said Riley, as he looked back at his father
holding his sister in his arms so that she could peer inside the
dollhouses. But Sam was already halfway up the escalator. He didn't
even hear Riley's reply.</TE>
<TE>   "You oughta get this," said Sam, holding up a portable CD player.
"It only costs $28.95."</TE>

<HD>Sharing Winona's Pain but Not Her Publicist</HD>

<LD>I was stopped for shoplifting the other day at a Target store.</LD>
<LD>   I wasn't really trying to steal the small notebook in the bottom
of my shopping cart. It was just there. But for a fleeting moment of
guilt and apprehension, I looked into the soul of Winona Ryder.</LD>
<LD>   I'm not saying the winsome little thing is guilty or innocent of
trying to steal $4,760 worth of stuff from Saks Fifth Avenue in
Beverly Hills. Her lawyer says it's all a big mistake, and her
publicist is looking forward to explaining the whole thing.</LD>
<TE>   They are going to have ample time to do just that in court. Ryder
is charged not only with stealing, but also with possession of a
controlled substance without a prescription.</TE>
<TE>   My incident was also a big misunderstanding, but the object of the
misunderstanding cost not $4,760 but $1.98. Also, the controlled
substance I carried was for lowering my cholesterol and not for
launching me into orbit around the sun.</TE>
<TE>   Most shoplifters operate in my range, not in the range Ryder is
accused of occupying. However, store security personnel tend to
become testy over the little things too, because stores lose about
$10 billion a year to people who drop stuff into their bags or their
shopping carts without paying.</TE>
<TE>   The security guard who stopped me on my way out was short, square
and blunt. "Did you pay for that object in your cart, sir?" she asked
in the tone of a cop who had just caught me murdering my sister. Are
you killing your sister, sir?</TE>
<TE>   I had purchased a bunch of things, and the little notebook, silly
me, had been overlooked on the bottom of the cart and not placed for
payment on the counter.</TE>
<TE>   I looked at the notebook. I looked at the guard. The guard looked
at me.</TE>
<TE>   Freeze frame.</TE>
<TE>   I am standing there thinking about Winona Ryder. Some guys, caught
in a similar situation, might think about God or state prison or the
humiliation of disclosure or, worse, the anguish of public pity. For
me, it's the girl interrupted.</TE>
<TE>   I am reasonably certain that had I been charged with shoplifting,
the case would not have been treated with the same interest accorded
Ryder. I would not be invited to appear on "Saturday Night Live" to
make funny of my predicament, and even if a TV camera had smashed my
head open, no one would have noticed, much less sympathized.</TE>
<TE>   I am, however, fairly sure that my editors, all of them, might
take a dim view of having someone on their staff who steals $1.98
notebooks. Big-time thievery, while reprehensible, at least possesses
a kind of larcenous dignity. Stealing a cheap little notebook is
degrading and disgusting.</TE>
<TE>   I suppose, if it came to a trial, I could always plead insanity.
Many would support the plea, including, I'm sure, my wife and
children and a good many people in South Pasadena. Even the dog
thinks me a bit loony.</TE>
<TE>   It might work in Ryder's case too. She's seemed a little on the
eerie side since portraying the dark and haunted kid in
"Beetlejuice." The way she hung suspended in midair while singing
"Shake, shake, shake, senora ... " struck me as more real than
special effects. I was sure she was possessed of the supernatural
power that allowed her to float like a balloon.</TE>
<TE>   Actors are odd people. They are forever being arrested or at least
exposed for doing stupid things but generally manage to squirm out of
their predicaments. I can still see Hugh Grant on the Jay Leno show
winning our hearts being cute and mumbly after he was caught with the
hooker.</TE>
<TE>   Lacking their celebrity, however, I would become nothing more than
a pathetic journalistic hypocrite trying to undermine the American
profit motive. As I stand there, I think about making a break for it
and being shot down like a dog. At least I'd be moving.</TE>
<TE>   Resume action.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh," I said, looking down at the $1.98 notebook in my shopping
cart. "Oh." It sounded effeminate. Like "oooo."</TE>
<TE>   "Did you pay for that, sir?" the guard demanded, pointing to the
notebook. She reminded me of the tough female cop in the St. Louis
bus depot on the old "John Larroquette Show." I said I thought I had.
I really did think that.</TE>
<TE>   "Your receipt, sir," the guard demanded.</TE>
<TE>   My hand shook as I fished for the bill of sale. She took it,
studied it and said, "It's not on here." I felt like Walter Mitty as
James Cagney shooting it out with the cops. You'll never take me
alive!</TE>
<TE>   "You'll have to pay for that, sir."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, yes, wow, of course, sure, oooo."</TE>
<TE>   I hustled back to the register like a schoolgirl late for class,
paid the $1.98 plus tax and was out the door with the dark and
accusing glare of the guard burning between my shoulder blades.</TE>
<TE>   I decided then and there, and perhaps Winona should too, that I
would never be in a situation again where even the suggestion of
thievery could manifest itself. I was Walter Mitty in a white robe,
with the light of God shining on me, singing "Ave Maria."</TE>
<TE>   I really wasn't trying to steal the notebook. It was a terrible
mistake. The publicist I'm about to hire will explain it in more
detail next week on David Letterman.</TE>

<LD>In a converted warehouse on Ivar Avenue in Hollywood, Marines and
Navajo "code talkers" from World War II mingled with publicists,
agents and photographers at the "Windtalkers" after party Tuesday
night.</LD>
<LD>   Nicolas Cage huddled with Lisa Marie Presley in one corner as his
mother, Joy Vogelsang, chatted with Adam Beach at the next table.
Beach was enthusiastic about his co-star. "The rhythm of his soul ...
," he said before leaning over to tell Cage's mother how much he
admired her son.</LD>
<LD>   Cage's veneration was directed at the code talkers.</LD>
<TE>   "They were instrumental in helping to win the war," he said,
adding that a recognition of their effort was "a little overdue." The
movie, which charts how a group of Navajo Marines helped develop a
military code based on their dialect, was an important tribute, Cage
said.</TE>
<TE>   Chester Nez, 81, one of the original code talkers, couldn't see
Cage from where he was sitting. He and a group of his fellow Navajo
veterans were seated outside in the parking lot, which had been
furnished and carpeted for the occasion. But Nez didn't mind. He was
just happy to be there. "I've never been to Hollywood before," he
said. "It's a strange feeling to be part of the crowd. It's
wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   A couple of code talkers were brought in for a photo opportunity
with Christian Slater. Nearby, Arianna Huffington made her way
through the crowd, passing a group of Marines standing in a corner.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Defense had provided some technical advice to
the movie, and the party got the DOD stamp of approval. "We're all
excited to be here," said Maj. Jeff Nyhart of Camp Pendleton.</TE>
<TE>   Eager to be part of the Hollywood premiere, some had paid their
own way. Sgt. Freddy Ortiz, who'd flown in from Hawaii, said the $700
travel cost was worth it. "I expected it to be more on the wild
side," he said. "But it's kind of relaxed. I like it."</TE>
<TE>   Sitting outside on a leather couch and surveying the scene was
Morgan J. Freeman, a director (who's not related to the similarly
named actor). He had brought a friend from Long Beach and a game of
backgammon, in case the party got boring. Having just made "American
Psycho II," "a tiny movie," Freeman wondered aloud about the cost of
the premiere and party, including the 50-some valets outside. "I
could probably make three movies for this kind of money," he said.
"If I have an after party, there won't be any valets. People can park
their own cars."</TE>
<TE>   Parental Guidance</TE>
<TE>   Few people are more attuned to the quirky work habits of director
Robert Altman than his production-designer son, Stephen Altman, who
has worked on nearly every one of his father's 20 or so films since
1985. The young Altman started showing up on his father's sets at age
15, hanging around the set decorator. ("I have a corner of Brewster
McCloud's room that I did," he said, referring to his father's 1970
film.)</TE>
<TE>   In the spirit of Father's Day, Stephen Altman offered the
following assessment of his 77-year-old dad on the job: He doesn't
suffer fools. He likes to improvise to the point of confusing the
actors, but he's focused, decisive and enjoys surveying "everyone" on
a work in progress. "It's always a team effort with him," said
Stephen Altman, 45. "He really involves everybody and does a Tom
Sawyer on them, gets everyone whitewashing the fence and loving it."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Altman seemed to agree with his son's assessment. "I am
focused on my own vision, and that's all that interests me," he said
by phone Monday. "You've got to really love it to do it."</TE>
<TE>   The director's technique isn't easy. "Gosford Park" co-star
Stephen Fry put it this way in the liner notes of the DVD release
(due out June 25): "One or both cameras will be moving and you
somehow go in between them and say your dialogue off-camera and think
that it's making no sense. You do four camera rehearsals, which are
absolute chaos, and you think you are in a nightmare. But by the
sixth rehearsal, suddenly this kind of ballet has emerged."</TE>
<TE>   "It is 'Make it up as you go along,' " Stephen Altman said of his
father's technique. "I believe he has more fun just making the movie
than [focusing on] what the movie is actually about."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the unconventional atmosphere of the Robert Altman set,
father and son say they genuinely like working together. "If we ever
have a disagreement it's pretty washed over during the next [scene]
set-up or the next backgammon game," the younger Altman said. Barring
that, his father said, "If he doesn't behave, I spank him."</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "I look nothing like him. You put anyone in a tri-cornered hat and
a uniform and they're going to look like Napoleon." --Actor Ian Holm
on his third portrayal of the Gallic leader in the film "Emperor's
New Clothes," due out in Los Angeles on June 28.</TE>

<HD>X-Rated Fantasies in a Cartoon Genre</HD>
<DH>Japan's hentai films, with doe-eyed characters and bizarre
sexuality, find a U.S. market</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nami, a student nurse in the Japanese cartoon "Koihime," slumps into
an overstuffed chair and kicks off her shoes after a long day at the
hospital. As her eyes close, the girl--who looks like a human version
of Hello Kitty--slips into a surreal dream where amorous monsters
chase her and tug at her white uniform. Suddenly, she's grabbed by an
alien and pulled onto its gray gelatinous body.</LD>
<LD>   "My goodness, this is odd," she says as the creature rips off her
dress. "Whatever you are, do your worst!" Alien tentacles and other
appendages begin to fly--just another
animated-Japanese-school-girl-meets-alien love story.</LD>
<LD>   Springing out of the furthest edges of animation is the world of
hentai, a genre of triple-X cartoons that explores the sexual
frontiers in an incongruously childlike format.</LD>
<TE>   The star is typically a perky, doe-eyed female in a high school
uniform. Her co-stars range from slobbering businessmen and
sadomasochistic school officials to hormonal extraterrestrials. When
the two groups meet, their escapades are often a mix of graphic
violence, weird sex and plot lines that can only be described as over
the top.</TE>
<TE>   Hentai, which literally means "perversion," is a product of the
multibillion-dollar Japanese animation industry, better known on
these shores for such animated, G-rated favorites as "Sailor Moon,"
"My Neighbor Totoro" and "Kiki's Delivery Service."</TE>
<TE>   With the rise of the global Internet, the fantasy pornography of
hentai has moved quickly to the U.S. and evolved into one of the more
prevalent--and legal--forms of erotica. Today, hentai films can be
easily bought online or through mainstream outlets, including Tower
Records and Fry's Electronics, which stock small collections of the
genre. Though such tame outlets don't carry triple-X videos with real
actors, many of the hentai titles available at these locations are
labeled: "All characters depicted in sexual conduct or in the nude
are aged 19 years or older."</TE>
<TE>   Despite those labels, the genre has fallen into the heated legal
battle over morality and technology. The U.S. Supreme Court decided
in April that "virtual" child pornography--no matter how realistic it
appears--is protected by the 1st Amendment as long as real children
are not a part of it. Pending federal legislation is trying to get
around the ruling, and the House Judiciary Committee is expected to
take up the Child Obscenity and Pornography Prevention Act of 2002
today.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the measures become law, hentai is considered relatively
obscure, and so far sits near the bottom of the Department of
Justice's priorities.</TE>
<TE>   That there is even a market for hentai in the U.S. underscores an
economic reality in the triple-X world: As sexual imagery becomes
standard fare of mainstream media, the exhibition market is crammed
with competition. "At a certain point, what's different will sell,"
said Joe Giarmo, vice president of production at Van Nuys-based
NuTech Digital Inc., one of the leading producers and distributors of
Japanese animation, karaoke and hentai DVDs.</TE>
<TE>   Companies have rushed to draft American porn stars to dub hentai
in English, an assignment few industry veterans will refuse. Still,
when these actors and actresses review the tapes they will be working
on, the fantastical acts they see shock even their jaded
sensibilities. Many are taken aback by the success of their cartoon
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   At a recording studio in Burbank, adult-film actress Kobe Tai
watches a television monitor play back a scene in "Koihime." As the
gray gelatinous alien undresses Nami, the actress casts a skeptical
glance at the technicians in the sound booth as if to say: "Are you
kidding?"</TE>
<TE>   The technicians nod in agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "It's twisted, no doubt," Tai said.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the strange activity in hentai, assumed by critics to be
purely for shock value, evolved from artists who exploited loopholes
in Japanese obscenity laws, said Jonathan Clements, co-author of the
Anime Encyclopedia.</TE>
<TE>   One 1918 code specified that the adult "pubic area need not be
hidden, but there should be no anatomical details to draw the
reader's attention."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of blocking artists from creating pornography,
illustrators and pornographers thwarted the law by depicting sexual
organs in shadow or outline. Body parts were colored blue or
green--signifying that they couldn't possibly be human--or were
depicted as part of a monster. And animators began drawing female
characters that looked like busty preteens--devoid of pubic hair, and
thus theoretically outside the boundaries of the regulation. To
Western eyes, the characters appear childlike. But to Japanese
viewers, the distinction is not as clear.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, the seduction or sexual violation of such girlish
characters evolved into a socially acceptable catharsis within the
sexually repressed Japanese culture, an exorcism of fantasy that is
taboo in the real world, according to author Helen McCarthy,
co-author of "The Erotic Anime Movie Guide."</TE>
<TE>   Aficionados of Japanese animation, known as "anime," say that the
high school uniforms and childlike faces are a standard convention of
the genre; a cultural fetish long established as merely fantasy. Just
wearing a school uniform is also no clear sign that the characters
are underage. Uniforms are worn at some junior colleges in Asia, and
the girlish look, known as the kawaii style, is favored by women well
into their 30s.</TE>
<TE>   Some fans of hentai--which is aimed at an adult, mostly male
audience--say they are attracted to the look, not the content, of the
videos.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been a fan of Japanese [animation] since I was a kid reading
comic books," Samuel Chen, 33, said while shopping for hentai DVDs at
Fry's Electronics in Woodland Hills. "I like it the same way I like
R-rated movies. It's not for the porn. It's for the art."</TE>
<TE>   But there is no question that hentai, regardless of its cultural
cues, goes beyond what many consider acceptable. By the early 1990s,
hentai artists, buoyed by several court cases, launched into a kind
of nuclear arms race into ever more exotic and strange sub-genres,
from alien hentai to demon and robot hentai.</TE>
<TE>   In the classic series "La Blue Girl," high school student Miko
Mido, spends her nights battling sex-crazed demons who, among other
transgressions, ravage her sister, a girls' volleyball team and, of
course, the heroine herself--who turns out to be a ninja with magical
powers.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole demon-sex thing is a genre unto itself," said Ken
Wiatrek, marketing coordinator for ADV Films, a subsidiary of
Texas-based AD Vision Inc. "The whole hentai thing is odd. I know it.
You know it. But it makes perfect sense in Japan." The demand for
English-translated hentai is small but growing--as is the number of
films being created, say American film distributors. Animators
released 35 animated porn film titles in Asia in 1997, according to
Clements; last year, 96 films were released.</TE>
<TE>   Between the Asian companies that produce the films and the
American consumers who buy them is a handful of small companies
fighting to dominate this market. At NuTech's warehouse in Van Nuys,
stacks of animated Japanese movies cram every spare inch.</TE>
<TE>   Not so long ago, NuTech focused on distributing such G-rated films
as "Robin Hood" and "Alice in Wonderland." Now, there is little room
for Alice or Maid Marian, as piles of DVDs with such titles as
"Immoral Sisters" and "Erotic City" squeeze them out.</TE>
<TE>   The graphic nature of hentai has led American distributors such as
NuTech to take steps to try to avoid problems. "We edit out all the
clear-cut kids from hentai we license from Japanese companies. But
Japanese artists tend to make their characters look far younger than
they really are," Giarmo said. "For them, the sky's the limit. For
us, it's a balancing act."</TE>
<TE>   So far, hentai has managed to survive both stepped-up attacks by
the Department of Justice against online erotica and recent legal
battles over what is--and is not--child pornography.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, federal law made it a crime to sell or possess
"any visual depiction" that seems to show a sex act--simulated or
real--involving an actor who appears to be a minor. By definition,
even cartoons fell under the umbrella of illegality.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court struck down part of the law involving a new
generation of "virtual" pornographers who rely entirely on computer
images. So long as real children are not depicted--or "morphed" into
a sex scene--the image, film or photograph cannot be prosecuted as
child pornography, the court said.</TE>
<TE>   Federal investigators countered that the harm rests in the
proliferation of material that pedophiles could use to seduce a minor
or incite child abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Senate Judiciary Committee ranking Republican Orrin
Hatch (R-Utah) has backed a bill in response to the high court's
decision to void the Child Pornography Protection Act of 1996, a law
that he helped author. The measure "prohibits visual depictions of
actual or apparent minors engaging in the most hard-core forms of
sexual activity" when the depictions "lack serious literary,
artistic, political or scientific value."</TE>
<TE>   House Crime Subcommittee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), backed by
U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, authored a similar measure. The House
bill will be reviewed by the Judiciary Committee today.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it child pornography when there's no real child involved?"
said attorney H. Louis Sirkin, who represents the Free Speech
Coalition, a collection of adult filmmakers who challenged the
federal child pornography laws in the Supreme Court case. "How do you
prove the person engaged in an activity is over age 18 if the person
doesn't even exist?''</TE>
<TE>   For companies in the emerging U.S. hentai market, what matters
most is figuring out what customers want to buy.</TE>
<TE>   NuTech, which translates up to 10 new hentai movies a month,
expects to release several hundred titles in the U.S. by the end of
2003. And the company says it is in talks with cable television
operators to roll out hentai movies on pay-per-view. Rival firms,
such as Anime 18, a division of the New York publishing firm Central
Park Media, are also adding to the number of titles to hit store
shelves each month.</TE>
<TE>   "You can only watch so many girls contort in so many ways before
you're bored," said Giarmo of NuTech, referring to traditional
pornography. "This is not the same old thing."</TE>

<HD>Tile From Italy Rises and Shines</HD>
<DH>Durable and colorful glass mosaics are influencing the U.S.
market</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY BRYANT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone who's been dazzled by the more than 10,000 mosaic tiles in the
basilica in Venice's St. Mark's Square or walked over colorful mosaic
floors in Rome knows that this 5,000-year-old technique and the
images it can so easily depict has the power to amaze and amuse.</LD>
<LD>   Yet today, most mosaic tile work is neutral and unimaginative, the
result of makers catering to builders rather than designers.</LD>
<LD>   "The tile industry in general isn't known for being
designer-oriented," says Doug Harris, national sales manager of
Bisazza Italian Glass Mosaic Tile.</LD>
<TE>   Bisazza, based in Italy, is working to change that, along with a
number of other U.S. glass mosaic tile companies, including Ann Sacks
in Oregon, Oceanside Glasstile in Carlsbad, Calif., and Walker Zanger
in Sylmar.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the last five years, glass tile use has been growing.
Designers are always looking at new materials, even if they're old,"
says Brian Flynn, president of California Art Tile in the Pacific
Design Center. "Bisazza is the world leader in innovative designs and
colors."</TE>
<TE>   Fabio Novembre, art director of Bisazza, created the company's
latest collection, Smalto, by adding streaks of enamel to individual
glass squares. This technique, like the others Bisazza uses, is based
on an ancient Venetian glass-making method.</TE>
<TE>   The company developed an industrialized process that can replicate
and mass-produce what was once crafted by hand; each tile is
uniformly square, with cushioned and beveled edges and no sharp
corners.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Bisazza's mosaics, however, are still partially done by
hand, among them "Oro," which is made by placing 24-karat gold leaf
between two layers of glass.</TE>
<TE>   To illustrate the versatility of glass mosaics, the 1998 Academy
Awards' Governor Ball featured two 8-foot-high Oscar statues covered
with more than 80,000 3/8-inch glittery Oro squares.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, a 5-by-7-foot portrait of the late George
Harrison is being generated from a computer image, with each pixel
transformed into a colored mosaic tile. "We can take any computer
picture and turn it into a trompe l'oeil-like representation," Harris
says.</TE>
<TE>   At the recent International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New
York, Marco Braga, Bisazza's graphic designer, came up with some
fashion-friendly ideas to help designers rethink mosaic use.</TE>
<TE>   "Pois" has giant polka-dots in red, blue and black, while "Tartan"
translates textile plaid into glass, and "Pulsar" resembles an Op Art
work.</TE>
<TE>   To help interior designers visualize glass mosaic use, Liz
Patterson, manager of Mission Tile West in Santa Monica, has
installed Bisazza's "Le Sfumature" in viola, a violet color blend
merging from light to dark. "We put this wall in because glass
mosaics are so popular right now. People like their textures and
durability."</TE>
<TE>   As for toughness, glass mosaics have 0% absorption and so are
impervious to damage from acids or chlorine, making them perfect for
swimming pools and outdoor use.</TE>
<TE>   They are also resistant to UV rays and thus fade resistant. On the
design side, their shimmery, translucent look complements water,
which is why they're often used in bathrooms as well as pools.</TE>
<TE>   "The downside to glass mosaics is they can be tricky to install
and thus expensive. You have to learn by doing, not from a book,"
says Flynn, of California Art Tile.</TE>
<TE>   With prices for Bisazza glass mosaic ranging from $8.70 to $48.50
a square foot, depending on color, materials and elaborateness of the
design, a large project can prove costly.</TE>
<TE>   The richness in colors can't be duplicated in ceramic tiles,
however, and the small scale of the individual tiles allows enough
flexibility to cover almost any shape.</TE>
<TE>   The company was founded in 1956 in Vicenza, Italy, by Renato
Bisazza. Renato's sons, Piero and Marco, have joined the business and
are in the process of expanding it through showrooms in New York,
Barcelona and Milan. A Paris showroom will open soon, and Los Angeles
is being considered for another. The company's biggest market is
still in Europe, but Bisazza hopes American designers will
increasingly begin to recognize the merits of this ancient craft.</TE>
<TE>   Locally, Bisazza mosaics may be seen at Mission Tile West, 1207
4th St., Santa Monica, and 853 Mission St., Pasadena, as well as at
California Art Tile, Pacific Design Center, 8687 Melrose Ave., West
Hollywood, and at Walker Zanger, 8750 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood,
among other locations.</TE>

<HD>Not Going by the Book</HD>
<DH>Stamps, art papers and other handmade details transform the
staid yearbook at a Santa Monica school</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNINE STEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can mess with some school traditions--pick a new mascot, alter
the prom, crown a homecoming king--but the yearbook usually stays
pretty much the same year after year, decade after decade.</LD>
<LD>   That's what Marcia Moore, book arts teacher at Santa Monica's
private, highly progressive New Roads School thought, until that day
she got a call from school head David Bryan. "He said, 'How would you
like to do the yearbook?' And I said, 'You're out of your mind. Why
would I want to do a yearbook?' And he said, 'Because I want you to
come up with something new.' "</LD>
<LD>   That something new is a bold, creative mix of collage, rubber
stamp work and hand-decorated paper. When they pick up their
yearbooks today, New Roads students will also get a pair of dice and
a deck of faux playing cards, each card featuring a senior portrait
along with a quote of their choosing. (One wrote: "Life is a bar of
chocolate because it's so damn good.") These two bonus elements
establish the book's themes of luck and fortune.</LD>
<TE>   This spiral-bound yearbook is light years away from the
traditional hard-bound volumes most schools produce. Where other
schools work with yearbook companies that offer ready-made covers and
plug photos into existing templates, under the guidance of Moore, New
Roads student yearbook staff of ninth- through 12th-graders has made
a memento that is also a work of art.</TE>
<TE>   Some 380 students will be perusing their unique yearbooks today as
the year comes to a close at this 7-year-old school. New Roads
utilizes three campuses for grades six through 12, and provides an
academic program that encourages creativity and activism. This is
Moore's second round at this creative new approach, and where last
year's book was a jampacked jumble of photos, magazine clippings and
text, this year's edition resembles an artist's book or journal.
Already the new style has sparked a mini-trend among a handful of
local schools.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Moore and a few of her yearbook staff gathered in a
sun-streaked classroom to pore over advance copies of the book, which
includes students from all three campuses. The yearbook includes
individual seniors' pages--each of the 50 soon-to-be-graduates was
allowed to be creative with his or her own page--as well as small
individual shots of students, sports teams and faculty, and a
"Manifesto" section, where students express their views on various
political and social issues. A page devoted to the topic of feminism
features huge open red lips rimmed with a zipper, and this quote from
English journalist, novelist and critic Rebecca West: "People call me
a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a
doormat or a prostitute." Another page contains the 1st Amendment,
with a finger pointing to it.</TE>
<TE>   Photographs, text and magazine pictures are collaged onto pages,
with hand-decorated paper as background, creating a consistent look.
Quotes and titles are rubber-stamped by hand and pieced on the page.</TE>
<TE>   A sports section is devoid of predictable team photos, instead
using cropped close-ups of athletes, with quotes such as this from
Olympic gold medal swimmer Matt Biondi: "Persistence can change
failure into extraordinary achievement." Team members' names are
stamped on the page.</TE>
<TE>   But the book's most intriguing features are in the extras: the
deck of cards, the dice, and for those who preordered their books, a
magic potion packet tucked inside.</TE>
<TE>   The themes of luck and fortune, says Moore, came to the staff
quickly after the events of Sept. 11. "When the yearbook companies
came to me to sell themselves, all the images they had were
patriotic--firemen and flags--and I felt that trivialized the event."</TE>
<TE>   Here, the 1st Amendment is the only reference--and an oblique one
at that--to the tragedy that occurred at the beginning of the school
year. "We figured everyone else was going to be doing tons of stuff
like the flag and 'God Bless America,' " says Cooper Nagengast, a
16-year-old junior from Culver City who was on the yearbook staff.</TE>
<TE>   With the mandate to buck the system and produce a compelling,
lively yearbook for 2001, Moore bypassed the major yearbook companies
and instead responded to a flier from Chatsworth-based Promax Digital
printers. "She showed us the paste-ups and we thought it was very
creative and something we could easily accomplish," says Dino Archon,
manager of Promax Digital. "I think it's great to do a book this way.
The way the artwork is presented, it's youth-oriented, it's like MTV
videos. When it comes to most yearbooks they're still stuck in the
1930s."</TE>
<TE>   New Roads' 2001 yearbook cost the school $18,000 to produce; 2002
came in at $28,000. The increase was due to more pages, the deck of
cards and other extras. Funds come from the sale of the books ($50
each), advertisement sales and the school's yearbook budget. Moore
says the school barely breaks even on the project.</TE>
<TE>   Although it seems like a success story now, when Moore started on
the first new book last year, not everyone was excited about the new
approach. "When the seniors found out we were doing this book they
were basically hysterical," she recalls, "because they thought I
would eliminate everything. But I am aware of what yearbooks mean to
people." Moore knew she had a hit on her hands when all 350 of the
2001 books sold out. She upped this year's run to 450 and expects it
to be a success as well. Promax has since signed up five new schools
after using New Roads' 2001 book as a marketing tool.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at old yearbooks," says Domanique Byington, an
18-year-old senior and yearbook staffer from Venice, "you just say,
'Oh, that was my friend I had math with.' But 10, 15 years from now
I'm going to pull this out and think, 'God, we were so cool!' "</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Eminem Show" continues to dominate the national album chart,
selling another 808,000 copies last week--more than the rest of the
Top 10 combined.</LD>
<LD>   The figure pushes the Eminem album's 15-day total to 2.4 million,
making it the biggest-selling CD of the year. The runner-up is Alan
Jackson's "Drive," which has sold 2.1 million copies since its
release in mid-February.</LD>
<LD>   Three albums are at the 1.9-million mark: Vol. 9 of "Now That's
What I Call Music," "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" and Celine Dion's "A
New Day Has Come."</LD>
<TE>   How long can Eminem hold on to No. 1? The Detroit rapper could be
challenged by Korn, whose "Untouchables" was released Tuesday. The
hard-rock band's last album, 1999's "Issues," sold 580,000 copies in
its first week.</TE>
<TE>   "From first-day sales, it looks like the new Korn album will fall
somewhere in the half-million range, so the question is how much
Eminem will decline in his third week," Geoff Mayfield, director of
charts for Billboard magazine, said Wednesday. "It looks like it will
be a real race." After Eminem, the best-selling album last week was
Vol. 5 in the "Totally Hits" compilation series. "Totally Hits 2002"
sold 137,000 copies.</TE>
<TE>   New releases by three other artists entered the chart in the Top
10: Donell Jones (No. 3), Dirty Vegas (No. 7) and Avril Lavigne (No.
8). 'N Sync's pairing with Nelly on "Girlfriend" has been the
nation's best-selling single for three months.</TE>

<LD>   Sure, cartoons are for kids. Tell that to the Cartoon Network,
which has been indulging the kid in all of us for 9 3/4 years. To
celebrate, such an important anniversary, the Museum of Television &amp;
Radio is hosting the Cartoon Power! v screening series. The series
starts Friday with "The Powerpuff Girls," those "Chemical X"-enhanced
kindergarteners who kick butt and take names. But it's the weekend
marathons where you can really get the scoop on what's going down in
Townsville: all 49 episodes will be screened in five-hour sessions,
complete with "The Whoop-!#@ Girls!,"v Craig McCracken's student film
(made at CalArts) that introduced the little heroes. The Cartoon
Power series continues through Sept. 15 with other screenings,
including "Johnny Bravo," "Grim &amp; Evil," "Samurai Jack" and a
30-episode marathon of the fabulously surreal "Space Ghost Coast to
Coast."</LD>

<TE>   Nina Nastasia lives in Manhattan and records in Chicago (with
storied producer Steve Albini), but the folk-with-strings and
folk-with-rock-band songs on her current album, "The Blackened Air,"

distinctly her own.</TE>

Teacher." These and almost 200 other classic cars, rods and
motorcycles will be part of the second annual Barrett-Jackson

<TE>   John Sayles, who was alternative before it was hip, gets a
four-film retrospective this week at the Nuart. The series, "John
Sayles: An American Indie Pioneer," features twin double bills of the
New Jersey filmmaker's early work. His 1984 sci-fi satire "Brother
From Another Planet," starring Joe Morton, with Sayles and David
Strathairn as intergalactic bounty hunters, and the 1983 drama
"Lianna," starring Linda Griffiths as a young housewife who falls in
love with another woman, will be shown Friday through Sunday.
Starting Monday is Sayles' 1980 feature directing debut, "Return of
the Secaucus Seven," a pre-"Big Chill" drama about a group of '60s
student-radicals reuniting only to find that it was their own lives
that had changed radically. Screening with it is "Matewan," an
acclaimed 1987 labor drama about strife among coal miners in 1920s
West Virginia, featuring Chris Cooper as a serious union organizer
and James Earl Jones as a miner called Few Clothes, with
cinematography by Haskell Wexler.</TE>

<TE>   8pm Theater</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Kane's plays were beyond edgy in their use of explicit sex,
violence and mutilation as metaphors for humanity's capacity to
indulge its dark side. The British writer was both reviled and
celebrated (with Harold Pinter a chief champion) before her 1999
suicide at age 28. Productions in the U.S. have been extremely rare,
but now comes the West Coast premiere of "Cleansed," a litany of
horrors wreaked upon the inmates of a mental hospital. The play asks
whether love and a spark of humanity can endure despite utmost
suffering. It comes from Rude Guerrilla, a Santa Ana company with a
fondness for playwrights who transgress.</TE>
<TE>   "Cleansed," Rude Guerrilla Theater Company's Empire Theater, 200
N. Broadway, Santa Ana, 8 p.m. Regular schedule: Fridays and
Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2:30 p.m. Also July 3, 8 p.m. Ends July
7. $15. (714) 547-4688. No one under 17 admitted.</TE>

<LD>   The 10th annual KROQ Weenie Roast reflects the recent thaw in the
alt-rock titan's playlist, on which the unabated angst and aggro have
given way to a little peace, love and understanding. So along with
the hard stuff this year (Puddle of Mudd, System of a Down, the
Strokes, Papa Roach) comes a dose of Moby, Jack Johnson and Jimmy Eat
World.</LD>

<TE>   The schizoid, er ... eclectic state of popular music doesn't find
a more grandiose showcase than KIIS-FM's annual Wango Tango concert,
which in its fifth year moves to the vastness of the Rose Bowl to
make room for such strange bedfellows as intense rocker Alanis
Morissette and pint-size rapper Aaron Carter, subtle soul sister
India.Arie and long-ball specialist Celine Dion, volatile R&amp;B diva
Mary J. Blige and pop cartoon No Doubt. It all makes sense if you
listen to the Top 40 station long enough.</TE>

<TE>   8pm Dance</TE>
<TE>   As the Dance Kaleidoscope franchise twists in the wind for lack of
leadership, the local community is turning to such events as the
fourth annual Los Angeles Dance Invitational for major showcase
opportunities. A benefit for Gay and Lesbian Adolescent Social
Services Inc., the latest LADI performance will include dancing by 12
locally based companies, along with the winners of the Music Center's
Spotlight Awards in ballet and modern/jazz. In addition, expect a
presentation for distinguished teaching and an appearance by Broadway
diva Chita Rivera to accept an award for lifetime achievement. But
the hottest moments may well be seeing Stephanie Gilliland's
drop-dead-brilliant "Big Manuel" on a big stage or the latest
provocative collaboration between choreographer Robert Gilliam and
dancer Jamal Story. Seven local premieres are also featured.</TE>

new ABC talk show, he will bring his kinetic and wholly original
style of improvisational comedy-variety to the Orange County

talent, ranging from traditional to contemporary to blues to bop to

<LD>   Geoff Hoyle, who originated the role of Zazu in the Broadway
production of "The Lion King," has been compared to Charlie Chaplin,
Buster Keaton and Harpo Marx for his wildly inventive brand of
physical comedy. The actor-clown serves up new comic material and
such Hoyle classics as bulb-nosed Mr. Sniff in the world premiere of
his show, "A Feast of Fools," a wacky mix that includes on-stage
accompaniment by composer and multi-instrumentalist Gina Leishman.</LD>

the ghosts of their past in "Follies." The bittersweet Stephen
Sondheim-James Goldman musical, full of such classics as "I'm Still
Here" and "Losing My Mind," juxtaposes the retro follies numbers with
Sondheim's more contemporary character-</TE>
<TE>   developing songs, a musical parallel to the past and present lives

battle reenactments are a vast improvement on the originals. They
only last 30 minutes and no one gets killed or wounded. Not a
gangrenous limb in sight. And unlike real wars, you can bring a

Confederate camps will be given between skirmishes.</TE>

<TE>   As a young singer in San Francisco in the 1950s, Mary Stallings
drew inspiration from Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan, Carmen McRae and
others, but it was Dinah Washington who was her primary influence.
Then in the 1960s, Stallings worked with such greats as Louis Jordan,
Cal Tjader, Billy Eckstine, Dizzy Gillespie and Count Basie. During
the 1970s and '80s, Stallings put her musical career on the back
burner as she raised her daughter, taking only occasional club gigs
in and around the Bay Area. But she returned to performing full time
in the 1990s, coming back with more focused phrasing and a more
mature understanding of jazz's storytelling aspects.</TE>

<HD>Mixing It Up the Old-Fashioned Way</HD>
<DH>Standards from another era and fresh ingredients rule the
day at some watering holes around town</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS RUBIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Today's bars are all about time," laments Bob Casey. "Everything's
pre-made: Just add ice."</LD>
<LD>   Casey would know. He's worked in more than half a dozen watering
holes, from North Carolina to Florida. But these days--make that
nights--Casey's behind the bar at Cinnabar in Glendale, one of a
handful of places around town, from Trader Vic's to Michael's Room,
where things are done the old-fashioned way. It's not out of devotion
to retro; it's simply because those techniques make for
better-tasting drinks.</LD>
<LD>   At Cinnabar, most customers order from a special menu of vintage
and custom cocktails, from the Trader Vic's Mai Tai and the Raffles
Hotel Singapore Sling to the Cinnabar's own Negroni. Original
bartender Jason MacDonald, who moved to New York several years ago to
pursue his acting career, created that menu with owner Alvin Simon,
who was aiming for distinctive cocktails that fit the bar's look and
mood.</LD>
<TE>   Simon says, "Our signature is reviving classic drinks from the
'30s through the '50s, when people came to bars for cocktails, not
just a beer or a Jack and Coke."</TE>
<TE>   (The bar, too, speaks of another era: Simon purchased the huge
antique piece from the historic downtown joint Yee Mee Loo when it
closed. Tattered Chinese silk lanterns hang over the bar, and
cabinets on either side hold a collection of cocktail books from the
'40s and '50s.)</TE>
<TE>   Casey, who started working at Cinnabar 3 1/2 years ago, stepped
easily into the position.</TE>
<TE>   "I already knew half the cocktails on the list; that's why I got
the job," he says with a laugh. Moving fast, both hands flying like a
stock market trader's, Casey chats about the bar's specialties while
he works. He has no blender, and he's working with fresh lemon and
lime juices from the restaurant's kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   He carefully assembles a mojito, hand-pulling a few mint leaves to
order, then muddling them (think mortar and pestle) with a splash of
rock-candy sugar syrup, soda and lime juice "to release the oils," he
explains. He eschews sweet-and-sour mix, a timesaver that often gives
a canned, sickly sweet flavor to cocktails. Likewise, his mai tai
faithfully follows the Trader Vic's recipe: fresh lime juice, orgeat
syrup, and light and dark rums. Such hand-made exotic cocktails line
the bar and cover most dinner tables nightly at Cinnabar, which
speaks to their popularity with customers.</TE>
<TE>   A few other bartenders around town share Casey's enthusiasm for
authenticity. At Michael's Room in Los Feliz, there's a trio of
female bartenders (Traci McWain, Megan Mangum and Maggie McVeigh).</TE>
<TE>   "I make everything from scratch, including all mixes," McWain
says. An actress, writer and artist when not tending bar, McWain
whips up her Bloody Mary mix with tomato juice and fresh herbs while
setting up the bar for the night. Her sculpted arms, well displayed
by a sleeveless top, testify to nightly vigorous hand-shaking of
countless cocktails.</TE>
<TE>   But if McWain seems like a natural with the time-consuming,
vintage techniques, it's not something she's done in previous jobs,
including a stint at Mr. Stox in Anaheim. "There just wasn't enough
time," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Owner Michael Moore believes quality is essential to his success.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a high standard," Moore says. "It's the way we do things
in the restaurant," he says of the adjacent Hollywood Hills coffee
shop. "Our chef handpicks the vegetables every day at the market. We
have a lot of repeat customers because we operate at a certain
level."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   McWain uses only fresh juices--orange, grapefruit, lemon and
lime--all with plenty of pulp. She uses fresh egg whites in a brandy
Alexander and the various "sour" drinks, and she muddles orange rind
and cherries for a proper textbook (and labor-intensive)
old-fashioned.</TE>
<TE>   And it's not just the cocktails that get such special treatment.
McWain and the other bartenders devote equal attention to their
martini olives, marinating them in a variety of spices from the
kitchen. The mix changes from week to week and might feature a blend
of garlic, rosemary and peppercorns.</TE>
<TE>   The best--and most popular--cocktails in the house, McWain says,
are the margarita and the cosmopolitan, both made with fresh lime
juice.</TE>
<TE>   What does McWain drink when she goes elsewhere?</TE>
<TE>   Simple stuff, like beer or wine. She would never order margaritas
at another bar, she says, "because I know they're gonna stink."</TE>

<HD>A Subtle Sea Change in Sushi Style</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA BURUM</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sushi outlets have been opening in Southern California at a dizzying
pace. To distinguish themselves in this crowded arena, many new
places emphasize a specific style. Take Echigo and YuZu.</LD>
<LD>   Before you're even through the door at Echigo, a waitress advises,
"No California roll." As if the point needed emphasis, the words
"Traditional Tokyo-style sushi only, no California roll" also appear
on a blackboard that lists the day's available fish.</LD>
<LD>   Echigo calls to mind the sushi restaurants that cluster around
Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo, those casual little places that serve
whatever's freshest that day without fanfare. Similarly, Echigo's
sushi is utterly plain: no cucumber garnishes, no clouds of shredded
daikon, no intricate leaf cutouts.</LD>
<TE>   In the classic Edomae (old Tokyo) style, the sushi rice at Echigo
is so freshly cooked it's still warm.</TE>
<TE>   The knife work may be unspectacular here, but you're likely to
find, as I did, orange clam so fresh it's still moving or tiny pink
scallops served on the half shell with coral. One night there was
sweet, fresh Santa Barbara shrimp sushi. The luscious roe, still
clinging to the empty shrimp shells, came separately in a bowl with a
sprinkling of ponzu sauce.</TE>
<TE>   At these prices, don't expect freshly grated wasabi or new-harvest
green tea. There are several brands of premium sake, though.</TE>
<TE>   The room, on the second floor of a mini-mall, has plain
ebony-colored furniture, hospital-green tablecloths and a cordial
ambience. Unlike some sushi places, which more or less dictate what
you get, diners at the six or seven tables can order anything they
want. The bar is reserved for chef's choice (omakase) dinners, but
even there you can negotiate, to a degree. (Could tuna be omitted
from my meal? "Of course.") Still, everything is served in the proper
sequence, from the mildest- to strongest-tasting fish.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   YuZu Sushi Roll House &amp; Sake Bar is an old pizza place remodeled
in a spare, attractive way--not quite Japanese; call it Brentwood
chic. (From the look of the place, you'd expect most of the diners
drive SUVs, and you'd be right.) YuZu serves what it calls
"California-style" Japanese cuisine.</TE>
<TE>   Sushi purists might consider its complicated rolls a travesty, but
many evolved from regional Japanese lunch-box classics such as
futomaki (a hefty roll of omelet, sweet gourd and spinach), inari
(rice in fried tofu pouches) and chakin (sushi wrapped in thin egg
sheets).</TE>
<TE>   So YuZu's soft shell crab roll combines crab tempura with Alaskan
crab meat, avocado, cucumber and nori seaweed inside a thin carpet of
rice. Like a good burrito, it has just the right balance of crunch
and juiciness. In the YuZu special roll, the flavors of sweet, fresh
salmon, perfectly ripe avocado and rich, salty salmon roe merge
spectacularly with in a slightly brittle tofu skin wrapper. The usual
nigiri sushi is simple and fresh, though the selection here is fairly
limited.</TE>
<TE>   Even aficionados of creative rolls may find the Rolls-Royce roll a
bit excessive. It's a standard California roll (made with real crab)
under a salad-like topping of scallops, sliced tomato and a crunchy
smelt roe dressing. Groups of people order this like a tapa. Spicy
yellowtail crunch is raw fish garnished with tomato, herring roe and
a light, spicy mayonnaise, with fried wonton "chips" on the
side--this take on the nacho plate is so popular it has been joined
by a tuna version.</TE>
<TE>   The calamari tempura tastes of fresh oil; the pot stickers are OK.
But the Tokyo rib-eye Caesar salad, garnished with over-grilled beef,
and the soggy soba noodles with mushy eggplant and shiitake make the
kitchen seem amateur.</TE>
<TE>   And where was the advertised sake tasting? "That was a mistake,"
said the manager nonchalantly. In its place we got a list of premium
sakes to decipher by ourselves. At YuZu, the sushi rolls rock but the
sake bar hasn't arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Echigo, 12217 Santa Monica Blvd., No. 201, L.A. (310) 820-9787.
Lunch, noon to 2 p.m. Monday through Friday; dinner, 5:30 to 10 p.m.
Monday through Saturday. Beer and sake. Parking lot. All major cards.
Dinner for two, $45 to $85.</TE>
<TE>   * What to get: sushi, omakase dinner.</TE>

dinner, 5 to 10 p.m. daily. Beer and sake. Parking lot. All major

<HD>Down but Not Out</HD>
<DH>The big-money bouts have moved on, but boxing still thrives
on the fringe in Southern California</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY ROMMELMANN</AU>
<BD>Nancy Rommelmann is a Los Angeles-based freelance
writer. Her last cover story for Calendar Weekend was on swing
dancing.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So I'm watching Fox TV's "Celebrity Boxing 2" and wondering why. Why
is Darva Conger pounding on wee Olga Korbut as though not merely her
next 15 minutes of fame but her life depends on it? Why does Horshack
from "Welcome Back, Kotter," who's being whapped in the face by
"Saved by the Bell's" Screech, look as though he hasn't had a proper
night's sleep in months?</LD>
<LD>   And why do we bother to watch? Is it because we are so miffed that
we once bestowed that most ephemeral of modern gifts, fame, upon
these people that we need to see them beat on one another? "It's the
cheese factor," says my boyfriend, passing the popcorn.</LD>
<LD>   That cheese and boxing might be conceptually linked is a
relatively recent phenomenon, especially in Los Angeles, which for
much of the 20th century was a serious boxing town: Ninety-four world
title bouts were held at the Forum; the Olympic Auditorium, which
opened in 1925, hosted thousands of cards. By the '80s, however, the
Olympic had fallen into disrepair, and the Forum held its last fight
in 1999. In their heyday, they drew the top fighters and crowds of
more than 15,000.</LD>
<TE>   The big purses for the big bouts have moved on to Nevada, and
Southern Californians who don't feel like traveling and shelling out
hundreds if not thousands of dollars for a ticket make do with
pay-per-view.Still there is a reason to search out live boxing in
L.A.--not for the freak show but for the quickening, the
concentration; the way the spectacle in the ring becomes the only
thing; the prospect that one of the fighters you see might punch his
or her way into the big time. Besides, who among us cannot appreciate
the human condition distilled and decided in 12 rounds?</TE>
<TE>   To discover the current boxing scene, condensed yet intense, is to
search the city's edges where it foments. The venues have dropped to
a handful. The boxing itself ranges from small-time pro bouts to the
violent beauty of kickboxing. And the crowds? Often just 1,500 people
gathered in a hotel ballroom to see if the flyweight they've heard
about has a future, or because they and their buddies make a monthly
constitutional of Thursday night fights, or because their brother's
fighting, or because, after years of watching boxers get punched on
TV, they've got to see it up close.</TE>
<TE>   As for boxing's appeal for the rest of us, Joyce Carol Oates
writes of it in "On Boxing," her book-length encomium to the sport:
"Each boxing match is a story--a unique and highly condensed drama
without words. [Boxers] will know, as few of us can know of
ourselves, what physical and psychic powers they possess--of how
much, or how little, they are capable."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   At the Irvine Marriott, the parking lot is packed with BMWs and
high-end sports cars. In the lobby, a heavily male crowd buys beer
and sushi (you can also get hot dogs and other traditional stadium
food fare) from the bar before migrating toward the
crystal-chandeliered ballroom, where a monthly event that's been
going on for more than 17 years is about to start. "Welcome to Battle
in the Ballroom, the biggest little boxing show in America!" intones
the tuxedoed emcee, nodding at BITB's brand-new promoter, Oscar De La
Hoya, the World Boxing Council's junior-middleweight champion, who
waves to the 2,000-plus crowd--an olio of businessmen and surfer
dudes, car salesmen and cops--and pretends not to hear a group of
hecklers chant, "Vargas! Vargas!," a reference to Fernando Vargas,
whom De La Hoya will fight Sept. 14.</TE>
<TE>   As latecomers settle into folding chairs, the first bout on the
six-bout card begins. Felipe Gonzalez, who has "El Compadre"
embroidered on the waistband of his shorts, and Rogelio Ramirez,
making his debut, trade body blows; Ramirez takes one on the chin,
then two more. One sees the red welts rise and bloom on the boxers'
torsos, the bloodied spit fly out of their mouths; hears the crowd
keen with anguish and elation each time a punch lands with a dull
smack. After what seems like an eternity, the round ends, and we can
relax. Yes, we. Although one might give a hearty "Ooh" while watching
a fighter on TV take a punch, in person the experience is
excruciating--the involvement in his pain visceral and necessary and
arousing.</TE>
<TE>   "Get him," screams the crowd, as the timekeeper slaps the mat
(marking 10 seconds left to the round), and Gonzalez gets in a left
jab. "It's definitely different to see a guy get knocked out in
person than it is on TV," says Steve Andrijowych, a surfer from
Orange County with a scruff of goatee. "I like that it's a small
venue; it's a little bit more intimate."</TE>
<TE>   "Last time we were here, it was all knockouts," says his buddy,
Joe Doddy. "That's why you come, for the knockouts." Andrijowych
considers. "I disagree. I'm more here to see the sporting punch."</TE>
<TE>   Between fights, the Miller Lite card girls promenade around the
ring wearing sea-blue bathing suits and towering Lucite heels. They
toss complimentary T-shirts and baseball caps to the crowd, which
goes bananas, no one more than an 11-year-old boy ecstatically waving
his arms and screaming, "Meeeeeee." There are two messy fights, with
one opponent clearly outmatching the other, and then a bout between
two junior-bantamweight women. I can only say that watching women box
after watching men box is like watching a WNBA game after an NBA
game, in that it looks as though the participants are moving at
half-speed. Even this level of experience, however, is too grueling
for first-time boxing spectator Lisa Jaramillo.</TE>
<TE>   "If they come this way, I'm sheltering myself," she says, holding
up a copy of Ring Sports magazine. "There are bodily fluids flying
everywhere. I'm not scared, but I find myself asking, 'Why do they do
this?' " "I tried to explain it but it didn't go over," says her
husband, George, the assistant sheriff for Orange County. "Boxing
shows courage and determination, and there's a certain one-on-one
aspect that's different from other sports. There's a danger involved,
and finesse, and strength, and all the things that one looks to
sports for, and boxing really encompasses all of them."</TE>
<TE>   The last bout results in the evening's first knockout, the
junior-welterweight's head landing directly in front of De La Hoya.
What was it like for him to be on the other side of the ropes?</TE>
<TE>   "Strange," says De La Hoya. "If a fighter would see me from inside
the ring, and kind of look and want to say hi to me or something, I
had to be impartial, or else the other fighter would think, 'Oh,
you're favoring him,' so I just kept a straight face, trying to be
like a promoter. But as far as the show, gosh, it went great."</TE>
<TE>   Friday, 8 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   It's a different Marriott, this time in Norwalk, and a different
type of boxing, muay Thai, or kickboxing. The national sport of
Thailand, and fast gaining popularity here, muay Thai varies from
American boxing in that fighters can hit their opponents anywhere
(except the eyes and groin), with anything: fists, feet, limbs, head.</TE>
<TE>   "People think of muay Thai as legalized street fighting; it looks
so hard-core that it frightens them," says Paolo Tocha, a former
world champion who helped introduce muay Thai to America in such
films as "Bloodsport." "But really, it's a science, and very
spiritual." The ring in the ballroom is wreathed in red, white and
blue bunting, and the crowd of about 600 includes a lot of teenagers
and toddlers, many of whom are here to watch siblings compete.</TE>
<TE>   "The kicks over the head, the grabbing, those are all natural
moves for little kids," says Tocha, watching a 2-year-old perform a
kick-and-roll onto the carpet. "Still, muay Thai is nonstop violence;
it's no joke," adds Tocha, getting ready to ref the first bout, an
exhibition between two 12-year-old boys. "If you don't understand the
technique and how to block, you can get hurt very badly."</TE>
<TE>   The two 95-pound boys--one in royal blue shorts, the other in
aqua--spring at each other: Aqua lands a spinning kick in Royal's gut
within the first 10 seconds, causing him to curl up like a
caterpillar. Tocha lifts Royal from beneath his armpits and tells
him, "Breathe! Breathe!" Royal rallies and dives at Aqua; the crowd
cheers, and the music--horns, gongs and bells--revs faster and
louder. The boys grapple in and almost careen through the ropes, they
kick and hit each other with whatever is available, and watching it
is indeed as riveting and awful and adrenaline-producing as watching
a street fight, in that one literally cannot not take one's eyes off
the action. "I don't like seeing him up there," says Angel Plascencia
Sr., covering his face as his son Angel Jr.--Aqua--takes a shot to
the teeth.</TE>
<TE>   The violence ebbs and surges: Boxers perform the elegant wai kru,
a ritual that involves bowing to all four sides of the ring and
asking for protection; this, just before someone juts an elbow in an
opponent's throat or a jabs a knee that snaps bone, as in the case of
Jeff Fierro, who goes down in the sixth round with a broken femur.
Maybe. "Some of these guys," says Tocha, staring skeptically at the
mauve flush on Fierro's thigh, "they just don't want to get up."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The parking lot of Arrowhead Pond is dotted with guys sitting on
tailgates drinking beer. It's Saturday night, date night, and a
polyglot crowd of more than 5,000 people, including a preponderance
of couples, has shown up for Fight Night Live at the Pond. The venue
is massive (Arrowhead Pond is where the Mighty Ducks play), the setup
one we've seen in dozens of boxing movies: the dark arena, the
brightly lighted ring, the refs in zebra stripes and emcee with a
helmet of hair.</TE>
<TE>   "For years, I went to the Olympic Auditorium; that was in the
early '70s," says boxing fan Jim Sheble. "We came here last season,
and they had some pretty good fights--that's why we came back. We got
season tickets."</TE>
<TE>   "Though the season's shorter, maybe five fights all year," says
his friend Al Aguirre. Now in his 70s, he once managed former WBC
featherweight champ Danny "Little Red" Lopez. The fights are supposed
to start at 7 but don't, which gives people time to drink a lot of
beer and ogle the girls. Beloved, Summer and Michelle, three dancers
from a bikini bar in Long Beach, wear all-but-transparent,
rhinestone-studded gowns and parade up and down the aisles and around
the ring for no apparent reason but to inflame  the audience.
Finally, there's a fight, between super-featherweights Jesus Zatarin
(21-5-4) and Arnulfo Castillo (35-1-3). They come out, touch gloves
once, and begin some sort of love cha-cha; after 60 seconds, no one
has thrown a punch. The crowd jeers.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty-one KOs, against who? A sheep?"</TE>
<TE>   "Stop fighting like you're best friends!"</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Zatarin lands one, just as the round ends. "She's got a
better knockout," says Aquirre, as the Miller Lite girl's keister
fills the big screen suspended over the ring.</TE>
<TE>   "The card here tonight is not the greatest," says Peter Palmiere,
host of "Boxing Inside TV" on San Pedro's public-access station,
KPTV. "The local promotions don't have the money to bring in good
fighters, so even though it's interesting to see a lot of fighters
make their pro debuts, they make them against fighters with deficit
track records. Look at Joey Torres, against a guy with 0-1." That
Joey Torres is on the card at all tonight is, we're told during a
weepy video promo, something of a miracle: "They told me I'd never
get out of prison," says Torres, who did 21 years for a murder he
says he did not commit, and, at age 41, is making his boxing debut.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a joke, a freak show," says Palmiere. "But the American
people are attracted to the freak show."</TE>
<TE>   And speaking of cheese, here comes Torres, in a robe that reads
"Thug Life" and shedding crocodile tears. The crowd cheers,
sentimental favorite and all that, until he takes off his robe: At 5
feet 8, 199 pounds, he has a gut that is distended and sloppy, wet
and lumpy. Meanwhile, his opponent, Perry Williams, from Uganda, is a
taut 5 feet 11, 178 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "With Williams' reach, he's gonna kill him," says Aguirre. Torres
hangs out in his corner, punching himself in the head. When the bell
dings, he turns and sort of stares at Williams, who, 10 seconds into
the first round, taps Torres on the shoulder, and down he goes.
Looking shocked, Torres rolls onto his side; the ref wants to call a
TKO, but Torres bobbles up and over to Williams, who, at the mere
touch of Torres' glove, starts to weave.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you doing?" someone screams, as Williams falls into the
ropes. The crowd becomes enraged, yelling, "WWF! WWF!" as Williams
stumbles repeatedly. When he goes down in the second round and Torres
wins by TKO, the crowd chants its disgust.</TE>
<TE>   "Matches like that can really hurt the sport," says Palmiere.
"That was as bad as it gets."</TE>
<TE>   The crowd wants a real fight with heart and gets it:
light-heavyweights Julio Gonzalez (28-1) versus Joseph "The African
Express" Kiwanuka (27-4), who come out tough right away. They're
fast, they're in shape, they're evenly matched. The action is
nonstop, body blows and head shots; by the fifth round, both
fighters' shorts are covered in blood, and Gonzalez delivers two
punches to Kiwanuka's nose that send blood shooting through the air.
"Oh, God ... " moans the crowd, unable to look away from what is
stomach-churning, spellbinding, surreal and not our responsibility to
stop.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Gonzalez lands another on ("Oh, God") Kiwanuka's nose,
there's a flurry outside the ring, one guy punching another in the
face; the guy falls backward and overturns a press table, people pour
down from the stands and make it a melee. A dozen cops appear and
swing their clubs but can't stop the fight. Meanwhile, the fight
inside the ring is still going on, the crowd on its feet trying to
watch both sets of action. The perpetrators are finally handcuffed
and led up the aisle, where they break loose, setting off another
free-for-all; several dozen more people jump in, one knocks over a
cameraman and a cop, who almost lands in the lap of yours truly; I
stand on the arms of my chair and watch as the cop Maces the guy in
the face. The crowd is apoplectic with glee as people are handcuffed
and dragged from the arena.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that reminds me of the Olympic," shouts Sheble. Meanwhile,
the fight in the ring is called in the eighth, in favor of Gonzalez,
though few see what happened.</TE>
<TE>   The last bout of the night is the heavyweight division. At 5 feet
11, 272 pounds, Ronnie "The Bear" Smith (6-21) is one very big boy;
Javier Mora (12-0-1), 6 feet 2 and 243, wears a mouthpiece the colors
of the Mexican flag.</TE>
<TE>   The bell rings; Smith lumbers out, his body jiggling; he throws
punches as though he were asleep. Smith goes down in the second
round; the night is over. "Well, at least he tried," says Palmiere.
"Clearly, he was overweight, too old and outmatched, but he tried."</TE>

<LD>Boxing Scoring--Judges score each round based on who lands the most
punches, who's more aggressive and who's carrying the action of the
bout. Punches that land on the arms of an opponent don't count.
Rounds are three minutes long, with a one-minute rest period between
rounds.</LD>
<LD>   Rules vary from country to country, state to state and even boxing
organization to boxing organization. Here in California, most fights
use the 10-point must system, but there is no standing 8 count, no
three-knockdown rule, and fighters can be saved by the bell in the
last round only.</LD>
<LD>   Ten Point Must Scoring System--The winner of a round gets 10
points, the loser gets 9. If one fighter knocks his opponent down or
dominates him during the round, the winner still gets 10 points, but
the loser only gets 8 points.</LD>
<TE>   Three-Knockdown Rule--If a fighter is knocked down three times in
one round, he is considered knocked out and the fight is over.</TE>
<TE>   Saved by the Bell--If the fighter is knocked down near the end of
the round, the bell signaling the end of the round will "save" him,
even if he is down for longer than a 10-second count.</TE>
<TE>   Tomato Can--An opponent for an up-and-coming fighter, usually a
good bet to lose.</TE>
<TE>   Flesh Peddler--Manager who specializes in providing tomato cans
for bouts with up-and-coming fighters.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore first set out to make an
autobiographical film about the magic and power of movies in 1988,
little did he realize the impact it would have throughout Europe and
the U.S. "Cinema Paradiso" not only captured the hearts of critics
and moviegoers, it won a special jury prize at the Cannes Film
Festival in 1989 and the Oscar for best foreign-language film in
1990.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the two-hour version that audiences have come to know so well,
in which a small-time movie house washes away the despair of a
struggling Sicilian village in the '40s and '50s, and inspires a
wide-eyed boy to fall in love and later become a famous movie
director, is not the original vision Tornatore had in mind.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, the longer version, in which the melancholy movie
director (played by Jacques Perrin) returns to his village one last
time and desperately tries to rekindle the romance with the first
love that he has never forgotten (played by Brigitte Fossey), first
flopped in its native country. Heartbroken, Tornatore cut the
romantic payoff along with some other revealing footage, but it
didn't seem to make any difference until the film found new life at
the Cannes Film Festival and was snatched up by Miramax Films.</LD>
<TE>   Now, after all these years, the original director's cut of "Cinema
Paradiso" finally sees the light of day in the U.S. when it opens
Friday. What a difference the extra 48 minutes make. It's like
watching another movie. We get a sense of closure, and the story
takes on greater depth and complexity. The disparity between movies
and life becomes more ironic, and the great friendship between the
young boy and Alfredo (Philippe Noiret), the local film projectionist
who serves as his father figure is much darker.</TE>
<TE>   For Tornatore, there is a certain artistic vindication in getting
his original version released in the U.S, as he discusses the merits
of both versions through an interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that the long version, with all of its ingenious editing,
has more the form of an epic romance, which, behind its playful and
melancholy feel, cannot hide its tragic heart. The 125-minute version
is closer to a novel, is more reassuring and manages to make the
finale more strongly cathartic.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly in the [original] version of the film, the character of
Alfredo takes on much more layered and, at first sight, contradictory
tones. In the version shown around the world, Alfredo is an entirely
positive and reassuring character, a deus ex machina who can draw a
happy ending from what is only a bitter and melancholy denouement. In
the [original] version, Alfredo seems to betray Toto [the
protagonist] since it is he who pulls the strings of the young man's
life to the point of making him sacrifice the great love of his life
on the altar of another love, that for the cinema. In the shorter and
more consolatory version of 'Cinema Paradiso,' the plot frees [Toto]
from the need to have to make such a painful choice."</TE>
<TE>   Tornatore has Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein to thank for
releasing the original version of "Cinema Paradiso." According to the
director, Weinstein first approached him two years ago, but it wasn't
until last year's success with "Apocalypse Now Redux" that Miramax
made the commitment to release his director's cut.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to give a smart audience something to see this
summer," says Mark Gill, president of Miramax L.A. "These director's
cuts are fun and interesting--they provide a new way of thinking
about revered movies."</TE>
<TE>   Gill says he tested both versions of "Cinema Paradiso," and
viewers responded more positively to the director's cut. "They liked
getting an answer to the love of a lifetime, and it helped that this
version is a little steamier." It has an R rating.</TE>
<TE>   Like it or not, Gill says, we face a cultural problem in this
country. "We're only interested in what's new and different. Longer
versions spark conversation, like 'Apocalypse Now Redux,' which
aroused passions."</TE>
<TE>   Tornatore contends, however, that first impressions are harder to
shake. "It is certainly the case here that when a film we loved in
the past returns to the screen with new scenes added, comparison and
debate is inevitable. In general, people in the industry are more
interested to see the added details, but the majority of the public
usually remain tied to the first version of the film."</TE>
<TE>   "Cinema Paradiso" opens Friday at the Royal, 11523 Santa Monica
Blvd., West L.A. (310) 477-5581.</TE>

<DH>During aquarium sleepovers, kids learn about sea life in an
unusual environment</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROLYN PATRICIA SCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A trip to the aquarium no longer means neat lines of grade-schoolers
led past murky fish tanks, all the while being admonished to keep
their noses off the glass. At the Long Beach Aquarium of the Pacific,
a popular program has kids sleeping with the fishes--in the
non-"Godfather" sense of the phrase.</LD>
<LD>   "Lifestyles of the Fish and Famous," "The Reef That Never Sleeps"
and "Predator, Prey and Pajamas" are variations on the sleepover
theme. All share the same basic elements: Children, along with
parents and teachers or Scout leaders, come with their sleeping bags
to spend a night at the aquarium.</LD>
<LD>   The sleepover program, which began in 1998, has steadily grown in
popularity. Last year, the aquarium offered 80 sleepovers; this year
it'll have nearly 100. Aquarium director of education Amy Coppenger
explains the appeal: "At nighttime, the exhibits come alive and the
habitats look like a moonlit ocean."</LD>
<TE>   On a recent evening, the children and parents of a fifth-grade
class from Ellwood Elementary School in Goleta were greeted by
aquarium educators Gretchen Bazela, Alyssa Edwards and Sunshine
Thomas, who set the tone for the evening. The children sat
cross-legged under an 88-foot-long model of a blue whale suspended
from the ceiling of the grand hall.</TE>
<TE>   "Does anyone know the name of this animal?" asked Bazela, pointing
to the underbelly of the beast. "It's a whale!" the children shouted.
She described the dorsal fin, then made a pointed "fin" of her hands
atop her head, which became the signal for vertebrates throughout the
evening. A call-and-response system got kids' attention, too: After
learning the difference between a predator and its prey, when the
educators wanted quiet, they called out, "Predator!"</TE>
<TE>   "Prey!" the kids hollered back, but then got ready to listen.</TE>
<TE>   The average sleepover has about 45 participants, including
children and parents and guardians. Fifth-grader Justine Haight said,
"I would think you'd have to be in the fourth or fifth grade, so
you'd understand about the fish," but programs are open to kids as
young as 5.</TE>
<TE>   Young ones could get restless or possibly frightened, but
Coppenger said, "We've never had a youngster that didn't come to
enjoy the experience with the fish."</TE>
<TE>   Parents such as Terre Lapman enjoyed the process of discovery as
much as their children. "If you don't believe in God, you will after
you see this animal," she said, pointing to the Phycodurus eques or
the leafy sea dragon, tucked into a small corner tank. The creature
looks like the bent spokes of a wheel of twigs--each tipped with
fluttering, spotted green "leaves" that camouflage this exotic
species of sea horse.</TE>
<TE>   On the terrace, at a waist-high ray tank, Edwards demonstrated a
special two-finger technique for touching the rays. They feel slimy,
the educator warned the kids, but added, "Slime protects them from
bacteria and germs."</TE>
<TE>   Some squealed, "Eeew!"--but almost all reached into the shallow
pool. "I like the sting rays. I have a favorite one--that black one
over there," 10-year-old Taylor Gardiner gushed as she leaned in,
stretching her fingertips to just graze the sleek bat ray.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone had a favorite. "The penguins--they're so energetic.
They're so playful," said 10-year-old Robert Emmens. Classmate Nicole
Eisenbeisz insisted that the jelly room is the best: "The jellyfish
are flowing and they're so graceful."</TE>
<TE>   The unprecedented access to the exhibits, coupled with the
entertaining and informative sessions with educators, fueled lively
conversations.</TE>
<TE>   At dinnertime, pizza and drinks were gobbled up at an outdoor
amphitheater overlooking the seal and otter habitat.</TE>
<TE>   Then it was on to the 350,000-gallon Tropical Reef, where 2,000
fish--some 200 species, from the blue wrasse to the zebra
sharks--swim around a colorful coral reef. An aquarium diver in a wet
suit and equipped with a microphone entertained questions from the
kids: What's your favorite fish? Have you ever been bitten? Can you
do a back flip in the water?</TE>
<TE>   After games, sing-alongs, crafts and a snack break, the kids
selected a campsite--either the Tropical Reef or the sea otter
habitat. They would reconvene in the morning for breakfast with the
otters and sea lions, who get up early for their breakfast too and
make a lot of noise.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone, including the parents, was ready to turn in. As quiet
conversations died down to whispers, most sank into an especially
relaxed rest. The soft murmur of water circulating in the tanks and
the cool blue lighting made it easy to surrender to sleep and dreams
of the fishes.</TE>
<TE>   Sleepover at the Aquarium of the Pacific, 100 Aquarium Way, Long
Beach. $50 per person; for ages 5 and older. Tuesdays, Thursdays and
two Fridays a month. Preregistration required: (562) 951-1630 or
(888) 826-7257.</TE>

<KH>MY FAVORITE WEEKEND</KH>
<HD>Senor Amor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Adam Bregman</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>* The co-host of the "Molotov Cocktail Hour" on KXLU-FM (88.9),
Tuesdays, 11 p.m. to midnight. He has also been a DJ at 3 Clubs,
Liquid Kitty and Encounter.</LD>
<LD>   Books and Shampoo: On Friday night, I like to see what's happening
at the Soap Plant on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Feliz. They have the
greatest selection of books there, everything from fetish stuff to
noir to every sort of subculture to books about design and
architecture. They really have built up a nice library and likewise
with all their weird knickknacks and toys from all over the world.
So, if you want that hard-to-find Power Rangers shampoo or weird
masks from the jungles of Mexico, that's where you go to get it. And
their gallery shows are always really great too. I love all their
artists, you know, that's where Robert Williams and Joe Coleman and
all those guys were first shown. And they have good candy too.</LD>
<TE>   The King of Bangkok: I like to go to the Palm on Hollywood
Boulevard, where Kevin, the Thai Elvis, performs. It's a great Thai
restaurant. Unfortunately, it's really brightly lit. It sits in the
corner of a mini-mall. They have a little stage and he takes turns
with a guy who is maybe Armenian, who sings popular songs from back
in the day. And then they have this woman singing in Thai. But of
course, the star attraction is Kevin. He's just unbelievable. He
sounds a lot like Elvis and he's got the phenomenal wardrobe--the
jumpsuits with the high collars and the rings and the big glasses and
everything.</TE>
<TE>   The Lounge Bus: One thing that a friend, Julian, and I like to do
is we rent a bus and get, like, 60 people to go to lounges and piano
bars all over Southern California. Last time, we went to Crabby Joe's
downtown, this dive bar that's right next to a residence hotel. We
had everybody dress in formal attire, and we just completely took
over the place and the bartender--his name was Phil--couldn't have
cared less. Then we went to this really amazing restaurant, Dal Rae,
in Pico Rivera, an old-style surf and turf place. They have a
beautiful dining room and a nice bar area, where on the weekend they
have live entertainment. Apparently, the Rat Pack guys used to hang
out there. And then we went to this other piano bar-restaurant called
the Brass Dolphin in Downey, where the locals are swinging seniors.</TE>
<TE>   Another Bus Stop: We also went to the Commerce Casino, which is a
taste of Vegas 10 minutes from downtown L.A. They just renovated the
place and the lobby has these 15- or 20-foot-tall horses pulling this
chariot. I couldn't figure out the theme, but it's a sort of a
pantheistic thing--some Greek stuff, some Roman. They also have a
really great lounge there and every week, there's a different Top 40
band like the Super Sevens.</TE>
<TE>   If I Was a Japanese Man: One of my favorite stores is Record
Surplus on Pico in West L.A. They have a really great selection of
stuff and the prices are good. And for the hard to find stuff--but
you pay the price--I go to Atomic Records in Burbank. Whenever I go
out of town, I make it a point to go record shopping, and those are
typically my souvenirs. I was just in New York, and I got the
original Japanese cast of "Fiddler on the Roof." I have a lot of
"Fiddler" stuff. I've got "Fiddler on the Roof Goes Latin," and
Cannonball Adderley did "Fiddler on the Roof," and I have another
Japanese thing, "Fiddler on the Roof Goes Pop."</TE>
<TE>   Two Rings on Each Finger: By far, the greatest entertainer in Las
Vegas is Cook E. Jarr. He looks like a cross between Elizabeth Taylor
and Gene Simmons, and he wears spandex pants and has a codpiece and
every finger has rings. Some fingers have two rings. He does soul,
funk, ballads and contemporary stuff, and he's really funny. He works
the crowd and the greatest people go to see him. He always plays
late. He starts at midnight and goes to 4 a.m. and plays at different
casinos around town.</TE>
<TE>   Seoul Food: Sunday night, I'll go to the Prince, on Catalina in
between 8th and Wilshire. It used to be an old-school surf and turf
place, with the dark wood panels and paintings of 18th century
royalty. Now, it has turned into a Korean place and it has the same
exact decor, but it's like it was plunked down in Seoul, South Korea.
They play really loud Korean pop music and they have a really great
menu, all kinds of weird stuff.</TE>

<HD>More Sly Humor Than Gore in Barker's 'Crazyface'</HD>

<LD>Clive Barker fans are legion. But those who have carefully shunned
Barker's typical gore-fests, both cinematic and literary, might be
happily surprised by Barker's "Crazyface," now receiving its West
Coast premiere at the Sacred Fools Theater.</LD>
<LD>   Not that the play doesn't feature its share of the outre,
including a sadistic angel and a trio of commedia-inspired clowns
inflicting tortures on those who have fallen afoul of church and
crown. However, Aaron Francis, who directed and designed this
ambitious and impressively realized production, wisely emphasizes the
play's mordant humor, keeping its sanguinary elements to a minimum.</LD>
<LD>   A familiar character from European folklore (and the merry
prankster who inspired Richard Strauss' famous tone poem), Til
Eulenspiegel, otherwise known as Crazyface, is the engaging simpleton
around whom Barker's convoluted plot revolves. Til, played with
puckish intensity by Mark Schrier, is a ragtag itinerant who roams
Europe with his mother and three sisters-in-law--a Brechtian
procession reminiscent of "Mother Courage." Unseen by the others,
Til's constant companion is a hectoring Angel (Henry Dittman). The
Angel, Don Rickles with wings, needles Til into injudicious outbursts
that make the witch-hunting peasants very nervous.</LD>
<TE>   Denounced as a madman and under sentence of death, Til flees for
his life with his sister-in-law Annie (Tara Platt) in tow. Annie
joins a band of fierce female brigands and goes off to complete the
circuit of her implausible destiny. Meanwhile, Til, ever the victim
of chance, receives a mysterious box from a dying Spanish spy that
contains a substance so precious that the monarchs of Europe are
willing to fight to the death over it.</TE>
<TE>   Warfare, famine and intrigue soon rage, with Til at the center of
the apocalyptic vortex. Barker's dystopian romp encompasses a Cain
and Abel conflict, the Machiavellian connivings of an evil
Inquisitor, and plenty of slapstick, including a comical interlude
with a snorting family of pig farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Chock-full of sly topical references (the mysterious box as a
metaphor for nuclear capability, the Inquisitor as exponent of
religious fundamentalism), Barker's imaginative but untrammeled
parable is unfortunately long-winded. However, Francis and company
rise to the challenge of their material with aplomb.</TE>
<TE>   Schrier, the standout of the evening, spearheads a large and
gifted cast. Also noteworthy: John Sylvain's lighting, Laura
Esposito's costumes, Brenda Varda's original score, Jason Tuttle's
sound and Richard Gustafson's masks and props--essential to this
vivid, richly disorienting endeavor.</TE>
<TE>   "Crazyface," Sacred Fools Theater, 660 N. Heliotrope Drive,
Hollywood. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends June 29. $15. (310)
281-8337. Running time: 2 hours, 40 minutes.</TE>

<HD>All Wrapped Up</HD>
<DH>Michelle Shocked is determined to manage her own career,
even if that means shrink-wrapping thousands of CDs herself</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Michelle Shocked had any doubts about starting her own record
company to release her music, they surfaced a few months ago when
copies of her album, "Natural Dub," arrived at her Los Angeles home.
There she sat in her living room, surrounded by 100,000 compact discs
and, separately, their covers, all in need of assembly,
shrink-wrapping, packing and distribution--with her husband, writer
Bart Bull, shaking his head in amusement.</LD>
<LD>   "Bart told me not to do it," says Shocked, who recently turned 40.
"My business manager told me not to do it. But I wanted to know
myself what 100,000 CDs felt like. I wanted to see it with my own
eyes, do it with my own hands." And that's just what she did, with a
lot of help from her 20-year-old niece, Rachel Krieger, though none
from Bull.</LD>
<LD>   "I said, 'You can hand-knit these CDs as much as you want, but I'm
not going to do it.' " Bull says. "But it's her record company and
her call. After all those years [with a major label] seeing the
reports of how much was given away and how things were done, she from
the get-go wanted to do everything herself."</LD>
<TE>   And that, by and large, is how the Texas native is doing it, both
with her Mighty Sound label--officially launched with the release of
this album--and as a concert act. The operation is pretty much
self-contained. Bull, his abstention from CD packing chores
notwithstanding, has a full plate with management and booking duties,
while Krieger has been enlisted for just about everything, including
overseeing CD and T-shirt sales at concerts and even taking shifts
behind the wheel of the tour bus they bought recently.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of the album, mixing gospel-tinged themes with blues, folk
and reggae-rooted sounds for what several key reviews have deemed the
strongest collection of her career, have started slowly, but have
been steadily growing (nearing 10,000 according to Nielsen
SoundScan). The progress has been encouraging enough that plans are
now being made for the label to reissue her earlier albums (she owns
the masters) as well as albums by two other singer-songwriters, New
Orleans-based Mike West and Phoenix musician Hans Olson.</TE>
<TE>   It's a lot of work, but after going seven years without a real
home for her recordings, it's a job she has embraced.</TE>
<TE>   "There are challenges; there are going to be setbacks," she says.
"But I didn't start a label until I had the confidence of the
boldness of my vision. I didn't want to take this on being any less
bold in business than in music, and I'm a risk-taker. I don't want to
make my marriage the foundation of my business venture. But this is a
solid foundation we're building on. It takes a lot of faith to
declare that kind of confidence. You always want to hedge your bets.
But I'm declaring it."</TE>
<TE>   Shocked also made a declaration of faith in her music. There's an
overt, though highly personalized and nonevangelical Christian
orientation in "Deep Natural." The song "Can't Take My Joy" is
explicitly Christian, a testimony to strength she has found, its
message powered by her passionate singing and a loping, reggae beat.
The fervor runs throughout the album, mixing with tales of surviving
hardships and sorrow ("Little Billie," describing a woman challenging
grief by dancing on the coffin of her murdered son) and renewing the
storytelling grace and activist's sense of community that first drew
attention to Shocked. The reggae motif (explored further in a
companion remix disc, "Natural Dub") also threads through the album,
blending with folk, blues and, of course, gospel influences.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time she's brought her faith to the fore. It
was, in fact, both her growing interest in spiritual matters and her
history of taking musical turns that led to her acrimonious departure
from Mercury Records in 1996 when, after a series of three albums
exploring singer-songwriter styles, jump swing and rural African
American/blackface minstrelsy roots and related social issues, her
plans for a gospel-tinged collection were rejected by company
executives.</TE>
<TE>   She made the album anyway, titling it "Good Hearted Woman" and
selling it at her shows, and was ultimately granted release from her
contract. That started a period of career uncertainty as she looked
for a situation that would suit her artistic inclinations.</TE>
<TE>   It was a rough time, she says, but one that strengthened her
faith, forged through involvement with urban churches in L.A. and New
Orleans, where she and Bull lived for several years and maintain a
second home. It also brought a time of new creative possibilities,
explored with the aid of multi-instrumentalist Fianchna O'Braonain,
formerly of Irish band Hothouse Flowers, who became and remains her
musical right-hand man.</TE>
<TE>   "In 'Can't Take My Joy' I say, 'I went to the mountaintop /
looking for a victory / found it in a valley low,' " Shocked says.
"When I was at the lowest point in my career, I found the spiritual
success which sustains me whether the career is going great or not.
With that you can take on any battle. When you find your victory in
defeat, you know you have something sure."</TE>
<TE>   But, she adds, this is just the start of a new chapter for her,
inspired by the spiritual activism and musical individuality of Bob
Marley and Curtis Mayfield.</TE>
<TE>   "I see it in three phases," she says of her career path. "First
was the Mercury years, creating that trilogy, and that was leaving
the trail of bread crumbs for myself that if I ever got lost in my
artistic journey, it would remind me and my audience where I come
from.</TE>
<TE>   "Then, in the last eight or nine years, my career has been moving
in the direction where I am now, but I didn't have the wherewithal or
infrastructure to put it into reality.</TE>
<TE>   "Now this is the journey where I find my own true voice. I know
the voices that have touched me and influenced me, and now I'm
confident in my ability to distill and synthesize it into my own
voice."</TE>

Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano, 7 and 8:45 p.m. $25. (949) 496-8930.</TE>

<LD>   Trainspotting--Would it be bad taste to call the stage adaptation
of Irvine Welsh's "Trainspotting"--first a novel, then a movie--about
dropout heroin junkies in Edinburgh, Scotland, a shot in the arm?
Sure, but no more so than anything else about the fierce, bold,
harrowing production on stage at Hollywood's Theatre/Theater. For
those who recall graphic scenes from the 1996 movie, the first thing
that pops to mind before seeing the stage version is: They can't
really do that on stage, can they? Yes, they can. Yeah, they do. If
anything, the stage version, directed by Roger Mathey, is even more
in-your-face. Your guide through this world is Mark Renton, played by
the engaging Justin Zachary, who narrates the tale with a humorous
but heartbreaking combination of amorality and innocence. The cast
provides a fragile humanity that renders this dance with death
ultimately life-affirming.</LD>

<LD>Video</LD>
<LD>   Bert &amp; Ernie's Word Play. Sony Wonder. 50 minutes. VHS: $10. DVD:
$13. Ages 2-6.</LD>
<LD>   Move over Elmo. Longtime "Sesame Street" pals Bert and Ernie get
top billing as they play hosts of a variety show with a learn-to-read
theme in their first direct-to-video special. Naturally, little red
superstar Elmo is on hand--pun intended--along with Kermit, Cookie
Monster, Grover, Prairie Dawn, Zoe and other familiar and new Muppet
pals.</LD>
<TE>   Wrapped up in easy-to-follow songs and comic bits, each animated
or live-action "act" is a lesson in forming words and sounding them
out. Between acts, Bert tells bad jokes and tries to avoid saying
"go," designated as the pie-throwing word. A couple of highlights:
gifted physical clown Bill Irwin, a "Sesame Street" regular,
demonstrating "open," "closed" and "nevermind"; Cookie Monster
scatting in the jazzy "It Takes a Little Letter"; Kermit's escalating
frustration at the T-shirt shop, where he finds that he shares his
name with a "gorf," a "forg" and a "grof"; and Bert, Oscar and Cookie
Monster's Broadway-style encore, an ode to their favorite
things--pigeons, trash and cookies, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Sorcerers &amp; Wizards: Real Magic. Artisan's Family Home
Entertainment. 52 minutes. VHS: $10. DVD: $15. Ages 8 and older.</TE>
<TE>   Was there a real Merlin? What is the basis for magic wands and
witches' flying brooms? This Discovery Channel documentary explores
the roots of magic in herbal lore and pre-Christian religions, and
the legends that sprang from rituals and the human need to understand
the natural world.</TE>
<TE>   It's interesting stuff, although the talks by scientific experts
and the reenactments of wizardry and witchery don't mesh well,
despite an attempt--more silly than spooky--to sustain an eerie mood
by having the experts speak while sitting in shadow. Note: Some
content is too intense for younger kids.</TE>
<TE>   Audio</TE>
<TE>   Gina D's Kids Club. CD: $13 (plus shipping and handling; the video
is $15). (866) 466-2333; www.raven moon.net. Ages 3-6.</TE>
<TE>   This CD features songs from a wannabe TV show for preschoolers
that hasn't made it to the air yet, although the CD and the companion
video version include a song that urges kids to ask parents to send
family videos to the "show." That premature song should have been
excluded. Otherwise, the tuneful pop-style songs are typical of the
genre, offering upbeat encouragement for kids to feel special, smile
and have a good day. The pleasant, modestly budgeted, 30-minute video
is a blend of puppetry and live characters that include gentle
mom-type host Gina D, a clownish cook and a clownish Aussie sidekick
in khaki shorts, and animated segments.</TE>

<HD>Mordant Wit, on the Death of a Playwright</HD>

<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recorded history of Shakespeare's life is riddled with enough
gaps to invite speculation. So is that of his contemporary,
Christopher Marlowe, who was killed under mysterious circumstances at
age 29.</LD>
<LD>   Charles Marowitz weaves both playwrights into a fictive account of
that incident in the mordantly funny "Murdering Marlowe," presented
by Malibu Stage Company.</LD>
<LD>   Marlowe and Shakespeare were born in 1564, but by the time of his
death in 1593, Marlowe had revolutionized drama with such plays as
"Tamburlaine," "Edward II" and "Doctor Faustus." Shakespeare had not
yet written anything comparable.</LD>
<TE>   Embroidering freely on fact and working in a style of prose and
blank verse that approximates the one used by both writers, Marowitz
envisions the 29-year-old Shakespeare being tormented by Marlowe's
success. "Fame is but a narrow little stage, not wide enough for all
that mount its board," the young Bard says, while a huge re-creation
of the "Tamburlaine" title page hangs tauntingly over everything he
does.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Matthys' Shakespeare is alternately raging and sullen,
while JD Cullum's Marlowe is prone to airy boastfulness and the
frivolous pursuits of alcohol and sex.</TE>
<TE>   Serving as his own director, Marowitz infuses the action with
intrigue, dark humor and looming tragedy as Shakespeare is driven by
warring muses--his critical wife, Ann Hathaway (Terry Diab), and his
nurturing mistress, Emilia (Susan Duerden)--and as the incautious,
unapologetically homosexual Marlowe runs afoul of the outraged Robert
Poley (Richard Osborn) and Ingram Frizer (Christopher Moore).</TE>
<TE>   "Murdering Marlowe," Malibu Stage Company, 29243 Pacific Coast
Highway, Malibu. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 5 p.m. Ends June
30. $20. (310) 589-1998. Running time: 1 hour, 45 minutes.</TE>

<LD>   Gallery Owner Sentenced in Conspiracy</LD>
<LD>   In a ruling seen as a warning to those dealing in illegally
imported antiquities, a prominent Manhattan antiques dealer has been
sentenced to 33 months in prison and fined $50,000.</LD>
<TE>   Frederick Schultz, a former president of the National Assn. of
Dealers in Ancient, Oriental and Primitive Art, had been convicted
Feb. 12 of taking part in a conspiracy to sell antiquities stolen
from Egypt and valued at $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Schultz was also ordered to return an Old Kingdom bas relief he
illegally acquired from corrupt members of Egypt's antiquities
police--an object he was selling for $80,000, the New York Times
reports.</TE>
<TE>   Egypt is one of several countries that have banned the export of
antiquities in recent decades. The Schultz case establishes that
Americans who deal in them may be found guilty of handling stolen
property.</TE>

<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   Press, Buchanan Part of MSNBC's New Slate</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC's ongoing revamping of its lineup is taking the cable
channel further and further away from straight news.</TE>
<TE>   In a jab at CNN, the network said Wednesday it has hired liberal
Bill Press and conservative Pat Buchanan, former adversaries on CNN's
"Crossfire," to anchor a two-hour program weekdays from 11 a.m. to 1
p.m. Press lost his "Crossfire" seat earlier this year when the
program was revamped.</TE>
<TE>   The duo will start on July 15, when MSNBC is changing its
prime-time lineup</TE>
<TE>   Weekdays from 9 to 11 a.m., beginning next week, MSNBC is also
adding another team of political opposites, Curtis Sliwa and Ron
Kuby, the morning-drive anchors on New York's WABC-AM radio.
Conservative Sliwa is founder of the volunteer crime-fighters the
Guardian Angels; Kuby is a civil rights lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Couple Not Amused by 'Harassment' Gag</TE>
<TE>   A Washington couple has slapped a $10-million lawsuit on MTV and
Las Vegas' Hard Rock hotel-casino, charging that they were given a
room with hidden cameras.</TE>
<TE>   The equipment was intended to record their reaction to finding
what seemed to be a mutilated corpse on the premises. The footage was
to air on an MTV series, "Harassment."</TE>
<TE>   When James and Laurie Ryan tried to leave the room, two actors
posing as security guards forced them inside, and the show's host
emerged to reveal the gag.</TE>
<TE>   The Ryans claim their privacy was invaded. MTV and the Hard Rock
had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Joel Grey will induct Bernadette Peters into the Hollywood Bowl
Hall of Fame, and actor-director Eric Idle will lead a tribute to
George Harrison at the June 28 event, to be hosted by Oscar winner
Anthony Hopkins.... Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck will star as
parents of a teenage daughter in the next Kevin Smith film, "Jersey
Girl," which will be shot in Philadelphia this summer.... Director
Barry Sonnenfeld ("Men in Black 2") is reuniting with producer Scott
Rudin, Variety reports, on "Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate
Events," the first of what Nickelodeon hopes will be a series based
on Daniel Handler's eight books about a pint-sized trio of
orphans.... Universal Television Enterprises has signed Sarah
Ferguson, the Duchess of York, to host "Fergie," a talk-variety show
set to debut in September 2003.... Topanga Canyon's Theatricum
Botanicum has completed the S. Mark Taper Youth Pavilion, a 100-seat
outdoor amphitheater.</TE>

<LD>* "Central Station's" producer Arthur Cohn, director Walter Salles
and cinematographer Walter Carvalho have regrouped to create "Behind
the Sun," an austere yet rewarding parable on the futility of revenge
and the redemptive power of a self-sacrificing love. Set in rural
Brazil in 1910, it tells of a lethal, long-running feud between two
families into which the modern world at last intrudes with unexpected
consequences. Carvalho's superb cinematography, Antonio Pinto's score
and a dedicated cast and crew admirably sustain this poetic and
uncompromising film. With Ravi Ramos Lacerda, Rodrigo Santoro, Flavia
Marcon Antonio and Jose Dumont. In Portuguese, with English
subtitles.</LD>

<LD>"I don't sing many positive songs," Bonnie Raitt joked to her Wiltern
Theatre audience on Tuesday. "Women in grief, that's my thing."</LD>
<LD>   Maybe so, but the blues-rocker's two-hour concert rarely hit a
truly negative note, and not just because she was so buoyant. The
singer-guitarist hailed her musician friends and reminisced about her
early days playing L.A. clubs. She brought on guest performers such
as slide guitarist Roy Rogers and tuba-playing old pal Freebo. She
even gave her dad, Broadway star John Raitt, an early Father's Day
present in the form of a brief duet.</LD>
<LD>   Inspired from the beginning of her career by such Delta blues
artists as Mississippi Fred McDowell, Raitt, 52, certainly knows that
the blues let folks lament their troubles. But they're also about
perseverance through adversity, and the songs from her current album,
"Silver Lining," as well as earlier works, tended more toward themes
of resilience, hope, forgiveness and devotion than unredeemed
despair. Even the tune she played after making her jest, Irish
songwriter Paul Brady's "Not the Only One," celebrated a healed heart
rather than mourning a broken one.</LD>
<TE>   She cut a slim, elegant figure with her glamorous red hair and
bright green bell-sleeve sweater, but Raitt nevertheless was
down-to-earth, leading her band with the casual ease of a
30-year-plus veteran. The sense in her work of bouncing back and
being grateful reflected her experiences as an artist who tenaciously
waited a long time for commercial success, as an activist who works
for such causes as the Rhythm &amp; Blues Foundation, and as a woman who
has grappled with substance abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there were times Tuesday when you wished things were a little
more down 'n' dirty. Not that such songs as the stompin' "Gnawin' on
It" and the smoky "The Fundamental Things" didn't have a sexy,
sinuous feel. But though she blended different styles--blues, R&amp;B,
rock, folk, African, country--into a contemporary-sounding cross
between New Orleans funk-rock and Muscle Shoals soul-pop, most of the
edges were smoothed over (though never slick) to be easily digestible
for her mainstream fans.</TE>
<TE>   Her masterful slide-guitar work provided most of the grit, and
when Raitt did cut loose, crouching to the stage floor as if to
better reach gut level, you could imagine her really letting it rip.
Yet too often the tasty riffs became overly tasteful, and her fine
four-piece band could not do much to liven up some of the less
compelling material.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there were riveting moments that proved soothing and
obliquely spoke to these troubled times. The David Gray-penned
"Silver Lining" was a pulsing, watery call to appreciate the magic of
life. And Raitt's pointed rendition of Mose Allison's "Everybody's
Cryin' Mercy," from her 1973 album "Takin' My Time," nicely pulled
together her different threads of interest.</TE>
<TE>   When she sang the line "Everybody's cryin' peace on earth, just as
soon as we win this war," it became a heartfelt commentary on the
world's precarious state.</TE>

<DH>Edward Serotta's photos from a relief agency in Sarajevo
reveal the little dramas spurred by a big event.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>War images deliver more anguish, heartbreak and heroism than almost
any other genre of photography. Shot by adventurers who make a habit
of putting themselves in harm's way, these documentary works often
capture, in single frames of film, the emotional intensity of
life-and-death dramas.</LD>
<LD>   A recent spate of big-budget movies suggests that Hollywood has
learned a lesson or two from classic war reportage. But on the big
screen, getting up close and personal with violence and its aftermath
is nothing like it is in reality. Studio productions tend to turn the
drudgery of warfare into dazzling batteries of special effects so
overwrought with amped-up realism that real life pales in comparison.</LD>
<LD>   At the Skirball Cultural Center in Brentwood, a modest exhibition
of 46 black-and-white photographs by Edward Serotta zeroes in on the
unspectacular underbelly of life in a war zone. Titled "Survival in
Sarajevo: Jews, Bosnia, and the Lessons of the Past," it focuses on
the activities of La Benevolencija, a group of 54 Jewish, Croatian,
Serbian and Muslim volunteers.</LD>
<TE>   By Hollywood standards, Serotta's photographs are boring.
Eschewing the flashy glamour of movies, his works also have little in
common with the evening news, whose producers seem hell-bent on
proving that modern life is an endless series of random tragedies.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than seeking out sensational scenarios and inflating their
dramatic potential, Serotta has photographed people driven by the
desire to make their lives (and those of their neighbors) as normal
as possible.</TE>
<TE>   In May 1992, when Bosnian Serbs began a three-year siege of
Sarajevo, a handful of Jews did not flee the city. They maintained
their neutrality and transformed their synagogue into "a free and
open house for all." It became the headquarters for their
non-sectarian operations.</TE>
<TE>   Although not experienced relief workers, they set up a soup
kitchen that fed 300 people a day. They staffed a free walk-in
medical clinic and ran three pharmacies, which dispensed thousands of
free prescriptions. Wall labels and a book also inform viewers that,
when mail delivery was cut off, they organized a makeshift postal
service that delivered 100,000 letters. When telephone lines went
down, they provided two-way radio connections to other cities. They
also sent 2,300 refugees to safety on 11 air and bus convoys. Their
labors were funded by the American Jewish Joint Distribution
Committee and a long list of other charitable organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Serotta's photographs depict the men and women who
performed these unglamorous tasks day after day. In one, a dentist
making his bimonthly house calls grips a set of dentures with both
hands as he reaches toward the camera's lens. In another, a cook uses
a shovel-size ladle to stir a huge pot of beans. In a third, a
middle-aged man prepares to leave Sarajevo by bringing two suitcases
to the synagogue.</TE>
<TE>   All three of these simply printed images appear to have been
staged. The people seem to be striking poses. It is as if they are
going through the motions of what they would ordinarily be doing so
that the Berlin-based photojournalist can catch them in the act.</TE>
<TE>   In this sense, Serotta's pictures are shamelessly illustrative.
This shortcoming is forgivable, given the seriousness of the subject.
But the posed quality of his photographs has another effect: It gives
viewers a glimpse of each sitter's personality.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the shadow-shrouded dentist appears to have followed
Serotta's directions to the letter. The resulting image embodies
nothing but gentle earnestness. The bearded cook is more playful,
hamming it up for the camera. And the man with the suitcases is more
than a little put out by the request to have his picture taken. His
posture and expression suggest that he wants to be left alone but is
too well mannered to make a scene.</TE>
<TE>   A series of 18 portraits emphasizes the staged aspect of Serotta's
photographs. In each, he posed one, two or three volunteers before a
blank backdrop and had them hold a tool of their trade, like a prop
for a play.</TE>
<TE>   A balding man who holds three books and looks weary appears over
the handwritten title "Jakob is La Benevolencija's Legal Counsel."
"Vlado is in Charge of the Two-way Radio" shows a youth wearing an
L.A. Kings jersey, holding a microphone and looking uncomfortable as
only a teen can. "Igor is the Postman" portrays a young man with
letters fanned out in his hand. Disdain and impatience simmer beneath
his embarrassment.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than making light of these volunteers' contributions,
Serotta's portraits pay homage to the fact that they are amateurs.
Although many are highly trained specialists who donate their
expertise, not one is a professional relief worker. Do-it-yourself
ingenuity and let's-pretend play-acting come together in this
touching series.</TE>
<TE>   Other photographs are more candid, particularly those that depict
the recipients of La Benevolencija's assistance. One close-up of a
doctor and nurse bandaging a boy's leg sidesteps sentimentality and
gets right down to work. Several images of people speaking into
two-way radios show them to be so absorbed in their conversations
that they don't even know they're being photographed. A similar sense
is conveyed by Serotta's image of four women busily making holiday
preparations.</TE>
<TE>   In general, the kids and the elderly are the least self-conscious.
Snugly wedged onto a small sofa, five children who are supposed to be
watching a clown's performance are instead lost in their own little
dramas. Seated at her kitchen table, 84-year-old Donka Nikolich
enjoys a cigarette with her coffee and sweets. Her wrinkled face and
upright posture eloquently express the poise and defiance of her
afternoon ritual.</TE>
<TE>   In another image, she gets an injection from a nurse named Miki.
Clenching her teeth and squeezing her eyes shut, she appears to be in
great pain. But you soon realize it's just a small discomfort that
has caused her to react so extremely.</TE>
<TE>   That action-packed picture is a terrific emblem of Serotta's show
as a whole. It demonstrates that the ordinary events that make up
everyday life are anything but boring. Although these little dramas
often seem to be unimportant, they're a big part of what makes life
worth living.</TE>

<LD>The Upscale Airstream: In the heart of Beverly Hills, Fred Eric
(Vida, Fred 62) is opening a diner that looks like an enormous
Airstream trailer on the outside. Eric and architect Alexis Roworth
have given the interior a sleek, early-'60s look: blond wood and
desert tones, with gnome-shaped stools designed by Philippe Starck.
"The food will be pure pop Americana with fresh product," Eric says,
"everything you'd want to eat every day but livelier, brighter and
more fun." It has a full bar and will make old-fashioned doughnuts to
order 24 hours a day. Opens July 7.</LD>

<LD>   Bel-Air Changes: Since being hired by the Hotel Bel-Air four
months ago, Philippe Reininger has been testing more daring dishes
(e.g., rack of lamb in pistachio crust with Peruvian potatoes and
cinnamon polenta in honey date sauce) than the Bel-Air has been used
to. But some things will never change. Regulars insisted that certain
classics remain, including the lemon pancakes, tortilla soup, Cobb
salad and house smoked salmon.</LD>

along with David and Kathleen Fink (Highlands Inn). Manzke describes
his new menu as being a lot like Patina's. "But I'll be able to use
what's in my backyard," he says. "We have absolutely every resource
within a few miles." Meanwhile, Patina owner Joachim Splichal has
replaced him with his former sous-chef, Eric Greenspan.</TE>

<DH>Films at LACMA catch up with subjects from '50s Ireland,
revisit Holocaust outrages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LACMA's splendid series, Double Exposure: Photography, Film and the
Cinema, continues Friday at 7:30 p.m. with the Los Angeles premiere
of Dierdre Lynch's deeply affecting "Photos to Send: Retracing
Dorothea Lange's Travels Through Ireland."</LD>
<LD>   In 1954, the renowned Lange went to rural County Clare on a Life
magazine assignment, which also resulted in a book. Lynch, in 1997,
decided to find out what happened to the subjects of those pictures.
At the time of Lange's travels, Ireland was in the throes of high
unemployment and resulting migration, and Lynch tells us that her
filming brought back fond memories and opened old wounds.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the beautiful farmland of County Clare has been
increasingly turned over to more profitable forestry with some
incursions of tract housing. Yet many of the warm, unpretentious and
welcoming people Lynch encounters seem unchanged, although they and
their families are clearly more prosperous than they were in 1954.
Most seem content with how their lives have turned out, but the
subjects of three of Lange's favorite photos stand out.</LD>
<TE>   We learn, sadly, that the pretty girl whose portrait Lange posted
in her workroom to cheer her on a rainy day died only a year later of
a burst appendix. Another subject, then a self-assured teenager, is
tracked by Lynch to a comfortable Jersey City, N.J., row house, where
he said he's had a better life than had he stayed in Ireland. And a
woman who was 10 when she was photographed by Lange says the
photographer captured her anger then--an anger born of growing
awareness that the beautiful environment was being spoiled, she said,
by the church, which she said advocated that clergy and parents beat
their children.</TE>
<TE>   Lange appears in archival footage, commenting on her County Clare
photos and stating that "one should use the camera as if one would be
struck blind the next day." No wonder Lange's photos retain their
intense beauty and emotional impact, and with "Photos to Send,"
Lynch, who will be present at the screening, honors the photographer
as well as the people in her photographs.</TE>
<TE>   "Photographer," also screening Friday, is a devastating film even
among Holocaust documentaries.</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, about 400 color slides from the early 1940s turned up in
mint condition in a Vienna antique shop. They had been taken by
Austrian Walter Genewein, the Nazis' chief accountant for the Lodz
Ghetto, and their subjects were the inhabitants of the ghetto.</TE>
<TE>   The irony is staggering: A man who participated in the Nazis'
"Final Solution"--indeed, he got the German government to remit 80%
of ghetto workers' wages to his office--inadvertently became one of
its chief chroniclers.</TE>
<TE>   Polish filmmaker Dariusz Jablonski frames his film by having
Arnold Mostowicz, who was a doctor in the Lodz Ghetto and is an
Auschwitz survivor, tell his terrible story. Jablonski cuts between
the settings of Genewein's photos and those locales today, often
substantially unchanged, giving the film movement, tempo and relief
from images of gaunt faces ridden with despair and occasionally
contempt at being photographed. (323) 857-6010.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Warhol on Film, which accompanies MOCA's Andy Warhol
retrospective, continues Friday at the Pacific Design Center's Silver
Screen Theater with the 24-minute "Haircut (No.1)" (1963), followed
by "Henry Geldzahler" (1964). The first of at least three films shot
at Factory regular Billy Name's haircutting parties shows him cutting
a friend's hair while a naked young man relaxes nearby. Nothing
happens, yet a sexual tension builds. The second finds Warhol's
friend and Metropolitan Museum of Art curator Henry Geldzahler
slouched in the Factory's famous couch with Warhol's silent
16-millimeter camera turned on him for a whopping 88 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   As time goes by, this prominent member of Manhattan's cultural
elite becomes as bored and restless as we do watching him. He runs
his hand through his hair, puffs on a cigar, repeatedly picks up and
puts down a glass ashtray.In his relentless way, Warhol humanizes a
mandarin figure in the world of art who behaves just as most of us
would in the same situation.</TE>
<TE>   Among the films screening at the Pacific Design Center on
Wednesday is "Couch" (1964). Warhol shot an eight-hour version of
"Couch," and this version is roughly an hour of the 2 1/2 hours of
footage known to exist. Frankly, an hour is just about right for a
series of four-minute loops of Warhol's entourage shown engaged in
various activities on the large sofa that was a key Factory fixture.</TE>
<TE>   Some scenes show people eating bananas rather suggestively, a
precursor to the sequences of people engaged in sex, which made this
film such a challenge to exhibit back in the '60s. (Even so, Warhol's
1968 "Blue Movie," regarded as the first theatrical feature to show
actual sexual intercourse, did play L.A. and elsewhere.) Yet these
sequences stand in stark contrast to the deliberate, often impersonal
intensity of pornography. The film's various groupings--two men, two
men and a woman--are at once casual, spontaneous and tender.</TE>
<TE>   "Couch" also has much humor: A couple can become amorous while
someone runs a vacuum in disinterest. Another loop features the
voluptuous Naomi Levine reclining nude on the couch and trying in
vain to attract a man absorbed in working on his motorcycle.</TE>
<TE>   "Couch" has a refreshing naturalness and remains a harbinger of
the sexual revolution that was to emerge as the tumultuous decade
progressed. (213) 621-1745.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Asian Film Foundation launches its Midnight @ Sunset Film
Festival with Friday and Saturday midnight screenings at the Sunset 5
of "The Longest Nite" (1998), a brutal, convoluted but absorbing
gangster thriller set in Macao and directed by Patrick Yau Tat-chi
for producers Johnnie To and Wai Ka-Fai. Lau Ching-wan plays a tall,
imposing killer-for-hire who totes a bowling-ball bag and menaces
Tony Leung Chiu-wai's corrupt cop. A showdown becomes inevitable--but
the two adversaries don't realize they are just pawns in a larger
scheme orchestrated by an underworld kingpin. Unreadable English
subtitles render the preview video fairly inscrutable, but the film
has the feel of living up to its high reputation. (323) 848-3500.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The American Cinematheque will present an eight-day run of the
restored Jean-Pierre Melville classic "Bob Le Flambeur," starting
tonight at 7:15 and 9:30 in the Spielberg Theater at the Egyptian.
The 1955 release, Melville's first film noir, is a variation on John
Huston's "The Asphalt Jungle." Personal and stylish, it stars Roger
Duchesne in the title role as a onetime bank robber (and ex-con) and
now full-time Montmartre gambler, running out of luck but not
gallantry.</TE>
<TE>   Trench-coated, he's a Gallic Bogey with a code of honor who tries
to save a young girl from the street--never mind that she's only got
minks and Cadillacs on her mind. But he's tempted by that famous one
last big heist.</TE>
<TE>   The romantic "Bob le Flambeur" has a gritty, spontaneous flow--it
was photographed, largely at night, by New Wave icon Henri
Decae--amid actual locales, primarily around Place Pigalle. (323)

<DH>The always eclectic Playboy festival brings together all
kinds of fun-loving music fans</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was June 1998--a warm, sunny day at the Hollywood Bowl--and New
Orleans clarinetist Pete Fountain was knocking out a string of
Dixieland licks at the annual Playboy Jazz Festival. The capacity
crowd seemed to be digging the music. And Fountain, pleased,
responded with even greater flights of musical fancy.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly, in the middle of his solo, virtually the entire crowd of
18,000 erupted in an enormous cheer. Fountain paused for a brief
moment, then nodded his head and played on.</LD>
<LD>   What he didn't know was that many in the crowd were also tuned to
the final game of the National Basketball Assn. championship series.
The burst of excitement? A reaction to Michael Jordan's final-second,
championship-winning jump shot.</LD>
<TE>   Variations on that scene are played out each year at the Playboy
Festival, which is a mini world within a music festival. As the 24th
annual installment kicks off Saturday, once again the promise of the
festival, in addition to the jazz, is an all-day, foot-tapping,
let's-all-groove party that manages to bring Los Angeles'
multifaceted communities into more of an idealized,
we-can-work-it-out coming together.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1992, the year of the riots, the city was tense," recalls Dick
Rosenzweig, festival president. "I really had to consider whether we
should even go forward. But our history of bringing together almost
36,000 attendees of every race and ethnic character over the two days
was so strong that I felt the festival might actually be a bonding
experience. It went off perfectly."</TE>
<TE>   A stroll around the grounds of the Bowl during one of the
festivals provides an illuminating view of the sociology of the
event. Up in the nosebleed section, the walkway that runs above the
top level of seats is always filled. Picnic baskets, coolers, folding
chairs, even large beach umbrellas line the upper side of the path.
Strangers laugh and drink together as the music reverberates from the
stage below.</TE>
<TE>   Directly in front of that stage, in the high-priced boxes,
somewhat more refined partying takes place, often with linen-covered
tables, crystal wine glasses and catered meals. Despite the
juxtaposition of styles--and difference in price: top-of-the-Bowl
seats go for $15, upscale seats in the boxes for $95--there are
striking similarities. "The top and the bottom seats sell out first,"
says festival producer Darlene Chan. "On the top, I think it's
because some people feel that if they're not going to be down close,
they might as well sit in the cheaper area, buy a couple of seats ...
and have room to spread out and party.</TE>
<TE>   "In the boxes near the stage, the goal is the same, even though
they've paid considerably more to be up close while they're doing
it."</TE>
<TE>   In other parts of the Bowl, there are gatherings of jazz fans who
arrive with their own themes. One group goes for a Hawaiian theme,
according to Chan. "They come every year to have a sort of reunion
with each other."</TE>
<TE>   Other areas are filled with groups of employees who have taken
advantage of company block purchases of tickets--FedEx and UPS, among
others.</TE>
<TE>   But no matter where they start out, virtually no one remains
rooted in one place. The view from the stage usually reveals a
panorama of movement. People heading for food, drink or, well,
relief, fill the aisles. Clusters of fans hang out at one box or
another, or gather in groups at the upper-level benches.</TE>
<TE>   And from the top to bottom of the Bowl, race, ethnicity and
economic status are blurred into a rainbow of blended colors with the
mixture of jazz fans--African American, white, Asian, Latino, young,
old--seemingly the same in the boxes as in the lofty aerie.</TE>
<TE>   One particularly memorable moment a few years ago captured the
combination of the music, the atmosphere and the communal
interaction. It was late afternoon, Rosenzweig recalls, when there
was a commotion near the top of the arena as the crowd spotted a
couple on the grass making love.</TE>
<TE>   "So maybe that's the basic statement of the Playboy Jazz Festival:
Make love, not war."</TE>

<LD>Think of each day of the 24th annual Playboy Jazz Festival on
Saturday and Sunday as a sequence of three overlapping segments, each
with its own program of music contributing to its own special vibe.
Here's how the two days break out (with approximate timings). The
festival will be at the Hollywood Bowl, 2301 N. Highland Ave.,
Hollywood. For information, call (213) 480-3232.</LD>
<LD>   SATURDAY</LD>
<LD>   Fun in the Sun (2:30-6 p.m.): The festival kicks off with a taste
of the future of jazz in a set by the L.A. Multi-School Jazz Band
(directed by Reggie Andrews). Swingster Lavay Smith and Her Red Hot
Skillet Lickers will brighten the afternoon, setting the stage for
some laid-back listening to three fine straight-ahead jazz acts: the
Charles Mingus 80th Birthday Tribute Big Band, singer Nnenna Freelon
and Joe Lovano &amp; Gil Goldstein's "Salute to Caruso."</LD>
<TE>   Conga Line Time (6-8 p.m.): As the sun begins to dip over the
hillside and the beach balls fly, the now well-oiled crowd will snap
out of its listening mode in search of foot-tapping action. The
Preservation Hall Jazz Band with Pete Fountain, the Afro-Cuban jazz
of Arturo Sandoval and the salsa of Maraca offer plenty of
opportunities to boogie through the aisles.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Time (8-11 p.m.): When darkness falls and the bright lights
are turned on, who better to step into the spotlight than the world's
most visible jazz artist, Wynton Marsalis. One of the festival's
perennially popular acts, singer Etta James, is next, with the
soul/funk rhythms of Marcus Miller capping off the evening.</TE>
<TE>   SUNDAY</TE>
<TE>   Working on the Tan (2-5 p.m.): Second-day celebrants are advised
to bring along a sun block with a higher SPF number. But the music
begins with a distinctly cooler tone via the smooth-jazz trumpet of
Chris Botti. The rest of the programming displays the intriguing
eclecticism often present in the festival's afternoon segments via
the rhythms of the Gypsy group Les Yeux Noirs (The Dark Eyes), Bill
Cosby's all-star assemblage the Cos of Good Music, and the Latin jazz
of Tolu (with Justo Almario and Alex Acuna).</TE>
<TE>   Let's Boogie (5-7:30 p.m.): The lowering sun once again triggers
the need to toss off warm afternoon-cold wine lethargy and get the
endorphins flowing. The Count Basie Orchestra (conducted by Grover
Mitchell) has the answer. So does returning blues artist Keb' Mo',
once again expected to galvanize the fans and fill the aisles, with
singer Patti Austin wrapping the segment with a tribute to Ella
Fitzgerald (accompanied by the Basie ensemble).</TE>
<TE>   More Prime Time (7:30-10:15 p.m.): The bright lights return,
arcing through the summer night to showcase the all-star "Directions
in Music," featuring Herbie Hancock, Michael Brecker and Roy
Hargrove. As the evening winds down, the pop jazz of guitarist Lee
Ritenour and the funk rhythms of Karl Denson's Tiny Universe bring
the segment, as well as the 24th Playboy Jazz Festival, to a
lighthearted close.</TE>

<HD>At This Year's Festival, Women Lead the Way</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Associating "women" with the word "Playboy" isn't exactly shocking,
but the 24th installment of the Playboy Jazz Festival could easily be
subtitled "The Year of the Women."</LD>
<LD>   Female jazz singers have always been present at the festival;
still, this year's event, which takes place Saturday and Sunday at
the Hollywood Bowl, has some special qualities for fans of the
distaff side of jazz vocalizing.</LD>
<LD>   The distinctive musical wares of free-flying scat and ballad
singer Nnenna Freelon; eclectic artist Patti Austin (doing an Ella
Fitzgerald tribute with the Count Basie Orchestra); the blues-based
Etta James; and swing specialist Lavay Smith will be on display.</LD>
<TE>   That's a big improvement over last year, when the jazz singing
banner was turned over to rhythm &amp; blues shouter Toshi Reagon, lounge
revivalist Keely Smith, pop jazz vocalist Nancy Wilson and New
Orleans hot-jazz belter Banu Gibson.</TE>
<TE>   Why the change? One reason may well be the successes of Diana
Krall, Jane Monheit, Cassandra Wilson and others, reviving the female
jazz singing genre with an intensity not seen since the years of
Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald and Carmen McRae.</TE>
<TE>   When any kind of jazz CD sales peak over the 1-million-and-beyond
mark, as Krall's have, it attracts attention within the
bottom-line-oriented record business. So it's not surprising that
Festival Productions programmer Darlene Chan has raised the bar of
vocal music quality significantly higher for this year's concerts.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with the dilemma of how to fill nearly 18,000 seats for the
two consecutive days of the festival, Chan can't completely avoid
commercial factors when she makes her choices.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of things I have to take into account," she says.
"Existing tours--who can't be available because they're in Europe,
and so forth. The ego demands of some artists and managers, who
insist that we put them into a particular part of the schedule."</TE>
<TE>   But Chan's primary consideration has always been to find balance
between performers whose creative qualities demand they be present,
and this year's contingent of female vocal artists reaches across the
spectrum of tastes.</TE>
<TE>   The elegant Freelon has been critically praised since her first
album was released a decade ago. Five Grammy Award nominations later,
she is consistently listed among the top female jazz vocal artists.
Her latest album, "Tales of Wonder," released on Tuesday, is devoted
to songs by singer-songwriter Stevie Wonder.</TE>
<TE>   Austin, who has been singing professionally since age 4, is a
defining example of musical versatility. As an A-list studio artist,
she has sung backup for Roberta Flack and Angela Bofill, hit the top
of the pop charts via duets with James Ingram ("Baby Come to Me") and
covered jazz from smooth to straight ahead. Her latest project is
"For Ella," a tribute to Ella Fitzgerald, released on May 21, and her
festival performance will include much of the material from the new
CD, performed with the Count Basie Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody knows that I can really do this kind of music," says
Austin. "So this is a different expectation that I have to deal with,
and there's some doubt out there, over whether I can do it....
Especially from those who love Ella, who give me that look that says,
'All right, baby, don't mess up my mama's music.' "</TE>
<TE>   James, whose inimitable voice became familiar to millions via her
soulful rendering of "At Last" in a Jaguar commercial, has been
primarily known as a blues singer since "Dance With Me Henry" topped
the R&amp;B charts in 1955. But her 1994 Grammy Award-winning performance
in the best jazz vocal category for the album "Mystery Lady (Songs of
Billie Holiday)" affirmed her capacity to smoothly reveal the
linkages between jazz and the blues.</TE>
<TE>   The straightforward James insists, however, upon describing her
jazz skills in modest terms. "I always feel a little strange when
they put me on a jazz show," she says. "When I was younger, we had
all those hip jazz singers--Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald, Carmen
McRae--and I always think of jazz singers as being so cool. But I
guess I've got my own blues cool, even if I don't have that
scooby-doo cool like they do."</TE>
<TE>   Swing's the thing with Lavay Smith and her Bay Area band, the
colorfully titled Red Hot Skillet Lickers. But it would be a mistake
to characterize either Smith or her players as swing revivalists.
Working with mostly veteran musicians, she--in tandem with the
group's co-founder, pianist Chris Seibert--is willing to move into
bebop and beyond if she finds tunes that meet her requisite of
danceability.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting the feelings of all four of the women appearing at this
weekend's festival, Smith says: "I like to think that no matter what
I'm doing, I'm doing it in a classic jazz kind of way."</TE>

<HD>This 'Monster's Ball' Is Thornton's Show</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Halle Berry may have won the best actress Academy Award for her
moving turn in "Monster's Ball," but it is her co-star, Billy Bob
Thornton, who steals the DVD (Lions Gate, $30).</LD>
<LD>   In contrast to the very serious film, about a widow who falls in
love with the death row guard involved in her husband's execution,
Thornton is just one wild, quirky and funny guy. In a series of
outtakes from the film, he tries to crack up his fellow actors right
before very dramatic scenes. In one clip, he performs as his mentally
challenged character from "Sling Blade" in a "Monster's Ball" scene
with Heath Ledger, who plays his son. The two try to keep a straight
face, but eventually Ledger loses it and starts howling with
laughter.</LD>
<LD>   Thornton is also very entertaining on the commentary track
interacting with Berry and the Swiss-born director, Marc Forster. The
director asks Thornton if he liked the title sequence, in which
Thornton's character is slowly revealed to be sleeping. Thornton
tells Forster that he doesn't like title sequences because audiences
then immediately know they are watching a film and are taken out of
the story and performances.</LD>
<TE>   The actor says he's been asked frequently about the significance
of his character eating ice cream with a plastic spoon. Thornton, who
has admitted to having a fear of antique furniture, says he insisted
on plastic spoons: He didn't want to use a metal prop spoon for fear
of germs.</TE>
<TE>   And one interesting tidbit: The hotel room where Ledger and
Thornton's characters have an encounter with a prostitute is actually
the same room where evangelist Jimmy Swaggart was caught with a lady
of the evening.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unless you have to be the first on your block to own the digital
edition of Oscar-winning Ridley Scott's war drama "Black Hawk Down"
(Columbia TriStar, $27), just rent this DVD. The only extras on the
disc are a serviceable documentary, trailers, production notes and
filmographies. A special edition is in the works, complete with
Scott's commentary, although a release date has not been announced.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although "Kate &amp; Leopold" doesn't live up to its comedic
potential, Australian hunk Hugh Jackman gives a delightful, romantic,
Golden Globe-nominated performance as a duke from the 19th century
who, due to a rip in the space-time continuum, finds himself in 21st
century New York. There he falls in love with a driven career woman
(Meg Ryan). Liev Schreiber and Breckin Meyer also star.</TE>
<TE>   The handsome DVD (Miramax, $30) includes the theatrical version
and the director's cut. The latter includes a subplot that some
critics who saw the film before it was released believed bordered on
incest. So all of those sequences were deleted before the romantic
comedy was released.</TE>
<TE>   The disc also includes a featurette on the costume design, a
watchable "on the set" featurette, a still gallery, a music video of
Sting's Oscar-nominated tune, "Until," deleted scenes with commentary
from director and co-writer James Mangold and a separate audio track
with Mangold. On that track, he talks about how he wanted to create a
dream past in the early sequences and even an idealized contemporary
New York City. He hoped audiences would find "Kate &amp; Leopold" to be a
life-affirming movie that would recall the Doris Day romantic
comedies of the 1950s.</TE>

<TE>   Respond2 Entertainment and Hope Enterprises have released a
three-disc DVD set, "Bob Hope--The Ultimate Collection" ($60) that
contains six hours of memories of Hope's television career, which
spanned nearly half a century.</TE>
<TE>   The first disc features Hope's two-hour NBC special from the
mid-'70s that serves up clips from his first 25 years on the Peacock
network, including his first appearance on NBC in 1949. The guests
are a veritable who's who of Hollywood, ranging from John Wayne to
John Denver. The best sketch finds Hope going mano a mano in the
boxing ring with Rocky Marciano at Madison Square Garden.</TE>
<TE>   The second disc includes his 1970 Christmas special, "Salute to
the Troops," which features Richard Nixon, Connie Stevens and Miss
World. Also included on the disc is one of Hope's last yuletide
specials from the early '90s, "Hope for the Holidays."</TE>
<TE>   The third disc includes very funny bloopers from his NBC specials,
as well as two short comedies Hope made in the mid-'30s and one of
his first radio broadcasts when he was master of ceremonies for a
1935 installment of "The Intimate Review."</TE>
<TE>   To order, call (866) 305-1348 or go to www.bobhope.com.</TE>

<TE>   Another entertainment giant, Judy Garland, would have celebrated
her 80th birthday on Monday. To mark the day, Pioneer and Classic
World Productions Inc. have released another DVD culled from her
1963-64 CBS musical variety series, "The Judy Garland Show." The
latest disc, "The Judy Garland Show: Legends" ($30), is a must for
all fans of the actress, who starred in such movie musical classics
as "The Wizard of Oz," "Meet Me in St. Louis" and "A Star Is Born."</TE>
<TE>   Digitally mastered from the original videotapes, "Legends"
features eight Garland solos, plus solo performances by guests such
as Barbra Streisand and Vic Damone. There are duets with Tony Bennett
and Peggy Lee, and two outtakes, including her attempt at a concert
version of "Born in a Trunk."</TE>
<TE>   Also included: a trivia quiz, photos and audio commentary from
Garland historian Coyne Steven Sanders, who supplies many insights
into Garland and her troubled series but makes a few factual faux pas
along the way.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As the big-screen version of "Scooby-Doo" hits the screens Friday,
Warner Home Video is unleashing four volumes of animated adventures
of the quirky Great Dane and his pals Shaggy, Fred, Daphne and Velma
($15 each for VHS; $20 each for DVD). "Scooby-Doo's Original
Mysteries" includes the first five episodes, originally telecast in
1969, about the canine sleuth. DVD extras include a sampling of four
songs, a trivia challenge and recipes.</TE>
<TE>   The other titles include: "Scooby-Doo Goes Hollywood," "Scooby-Doo
and the Ghoul School" and  "Scooby-Doo's Creepiest Capers."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Also new this week is the three-disc set of "Buffy the Vampire
Slayer" Season Two (Fox, $60), which has all 22 episodes of the TV
show's sophomore year. Among the extras on the DVD are an interview
with creator Joss Whedon, photo galleries, biographies and
featurettes on the production and makeup design.</TE>

<LD>The five-week siege of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem that
ended May 10 was more than a standoff between the Israeli army and
the Palestinians inside. Behind the scenes, another clash simmered,
between Israel's chief negotiator and the prevailing political winds.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight's "Frontline" (8 p.m., KCET; 10 p.m., KVCR) examines the
inner workings of both conflicts, following the charismatic
negotiator (identified here as Lt. Col. Lior) and his team as they
try to isolate cornered terror suspects by encouraging those
Palestinians not on the Israeli wanted list to leave the church.</LD>
<LD>   The show is a fascinating window into what happened in the siege's
final three weeks, combining tapes from inside the church with
exclusive footage of operations in Manger Square after other media
had been banished.</LD>
<TE>   In contrast with much of the TV coverage at the time, director
Dimitri Doganis and crew reveal what it was like for those on the
scene.</TE>
<TE>   "If you create a political crisis, you will never find a
solution," Lior says, explaining his approach to the siege, which
ended through a U.S.-brokered deal that was essentially the same as
the one his team had set up. "If the crisis is between people,
between two troops, you can find a solution."</TE>
<TE>   As it did in early April with a program about Palestinian suicide
bombings, "Frontline" again brings viewers into the heart of the
Mideast hostilities.</TE>

<LD>New Cabinet department -- A graphic accompanying a story in Friday's
Section A on the proposal for a Cabinet-level department to oversee
homeland security included an incorrect figure. The total budget for
the four proposed agencies that would make up the department was
correct as $37.5 billion, but the budget for one of those agencies,
the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection office, is
$364 million, not $364 billion.</LD>

California Living about Elga Sharpe, the chief of protocol for Los
Angeles, an incorrect title was given for Sharpe's assistant. Ginger
Barnard is deputy chief of protocol. The same story mentioned a board
of commissioners, which should have been a reference to the L.A.
County Board of Supervisors.</LD>

<HD>Andersen Jury Comes to Deadlock</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge orders the panel to continue its
deliberations. A retrial would be a blow to the government case
against Enron, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>The jury deliberating in the Arthur Andersen obstruction-of-justice
trial said Wednesday that it was deadlocked, raising the prospect of
a mistrial unless the panel can reach a unanimous decision through
further discussions.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon ordered the panel of nine men
and three women to continue deliberations today in hopes of avoiding
a hung jury.</LD>
<LD>   "We are not able to reach a unanimous decision," the jury said in
a note to the judge after more than 56 hours of deliberations.</LD>
<TE>   Harmon gave jurors the so-called Allen charge, based on the U.S.
Supreme Court decision in Allen vs. the United States, telling jurors
that they have the best understanding of the case and that there is
no reason to believe the evidence would be tried "better or more
exhaustively" in the event of a retrial.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to ask you to continue deliberations," Harmon said.
"This is an important case. The trial has been expensive in time,
effort and money, to both the defense and the prosecution. If you
should fail to agree on a verdict, the case is left open and must be
tried again."</TE>
<TE>   Over the objections of the defense, however, Harmon did not
include a sentence instructing the jury that "if the evidence in the
case fails to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the accused
should have your unanimous verdict of not guilty." Harmon said that
instruction did not appear relevant and told the defense, "If I'm
wrong, you [can] get me reversed."</TE>
<TE>   Jurors must reach a unanimous verdict to convict or acquit the
firm.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors declined to comment on the deadlock. In the event of a
hung jury, however, Justice Department officials indicated this week
they would seek a retrial.</TE>
<TE>   One recent study of the use of the Allen charge in federal cases
found that it often results in a verdict, but the decision is
typically appealed. In cases in which the jury voted to convict after
receiving the Allen instruction, the study found, higher courts
reversed the verdict about 24% of the time.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Hardin expressed mixed feelings about the
situation, noting that the divided panel indicates that the
government has not been able to convince the panel--at least thus
far--that Andersen is guilty.</TE>
<TE>   "This jury, unlike everyone else, listened to the facts," Hardin
said. "The problem is, once you have half a loaf, you want the whole
loaf."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen was charged with a single count of obstruction of justice
for shredding documents related to its audit of Enron Corp., the
energy trader that filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history Dec.
2.</TE>
<TE>   A hung jury would be a blow to the case against Enron, one legal
expert said, because it would sap the government of valuable time and
resources. Instead of being freed to concentrate on Enron, certain
prosecutors on the Justice Department's Enron task force would have
to gear up for an Andersen retrial.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, potential defendants could interpret a mistrial as a
sign of prosecutors' weakness, opt to forgo plea bargaining and in
essence dare the Justice Department to try to convict them.</TE>
<TE>   "It would really slow down the momentum," said John J. Fahy, a
former federal prosecutor in New Jersey and now a partner in Newark,
N.J., law firm Reed Smith. "They indicted Andersen fast. They wanted
to keep the focus on Enron. It would be a setback."</TE>
<TE>   Failure to win a conviction in the current trial could result in
criticism against Justice Department officials, particularly criminal
division chief Michael Chertoff, for diverting resources on Andersen
when Enron is seen as the chief target.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem for the government is that Andersen's lawyers,
having seen and evaluated the prosecution's witnesses, would be able
to put up a stiffer defense the second time around.</TE>
<TE>   "No prosecutor ever wants a retrial," Fahy said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is little likelihood that the government would drop
the charges because it would represent too great a loss of face in
such a high-profile case, he added.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases after a mistrial, the opposing sides will try to
reach a settlement. But Fahy said Andersen would have little to gain
from a settlement because the company is rapidly disintegrating. And
Hardin said Wednesday that the company will not cut a deal with the
government.</TE>
<TE>   Going into the trial, the government was widely seen to have a
huge advantage. David B. Duncan, who led the Enron audit team out of
Andersen's Houston office, pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice
April 9 and agreed to cooperate as the prosecution's star witness.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, prosecutors consider obstruction to be one of the
easiest white-collar offenses to prove, in part because it doesn't
usually require jurors to understand complex financial details.</TE>
<TE>   The jury impasse "really points out the vagaries of the justice
system," said Stephen Meagher, a former federal prosecutor now in
private practice in San Francisco. "It's never a no-risk proposition
to go to trial."</TE>
<TE>   In the course of the trial, Justice Department attorneys argued
that Andersen executives feared regulatory sanctions for their Enron
work in part because the firm already had run afoul of the Securities
and Exchange Commission for its audits of Waste Management Inc. and
Sunbeam Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the firm's legal department then devised a way to
shield Andersen from regulators and investor lawsuits by urging the
Enron audit team to comply with the firm's little-invoked
document-retention policy, which called for disposing of drafts,
copies and other files deemed unnecessary once auditors reached their
final accounting decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen countered by saying its executives lacked criminal
intent, and destroyed files under legal business practices. The
defense dismissed the idea of a concerted effort to destroy
documents, pointing out again and again that the papers introduced as
evidence by government prosecutors had been saved--and not
destroyed--by Andersen employees.</TE>
<TE>   Although a conviction probably would result in SEC action to bar
Andersen from auditing public companies, few industry observers see
the company surviving under any scenario, even an acquittal.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen already has lost its biggest clients, and key partners
and offices within the company have cut deals to move their practices
to rival accounting firms. Industry power is expected to consolidate
in a Big Four of major firms--Deloitte &amp; Touche,
PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst &amp; Young and KPMG.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amgen Inc., the world's largest biotechnology company, said it would
buy back as much as $2 billion of its stock, which has fallen 32%
this year.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement, made after U.S. markets closed, sent shares of
Thousand Oaks-based Amgen up 4.5% to $39.87 in heavy after-hours
trading. The shares had closed off 58 cents at $38.17 on Nasdaq.</LD>
<LD>   Amgen has already repurchased about $1 billion of its own shares
this year, and the board's authorization extends that, the company
said. The additional shares are to be acquired from now until June
2004, Amgen said.</LD>
<TE>   The current price makes buying back shares a good investment for
Amgen, Chief Executive Kevin Sharer said.</TE>
<TE>   Though declining, Amgen's performance has outpaced the Nasdaq
Biotechnology Index, which has fallen 46% in 2002.</TE>

<HD>Chip Companies Gear Up for Profit</HD>
<DH>Technology: Results are looking up for firms dealing in
many sectors. PC sales hurt Intel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Motorola Inc. said Wednesday that it expects a profit this year after
losing nearly $4 billion last year, the latest sign that brisk
spending on personal gadgetry may be stabilizing the battered tech
sector and setting the stage for a modest recovery.</LD>
<LD>   "We expect to be profitable in the third quarter 2002 and for the
full year 2002," Ed Breen, president and chief operating officer of
the Schaumburg, Ill., company, said at a Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.
conference in New York.</LD>
<LD>   The comments from the world's second-largest cell phone
manufacturer follow a steady stream of upbeat news by chip companies,
including Fairchild Semiconductors Corp., National Semiconductor
Corp., Applied Materials Inc. and Microchip Technology Inc.</LD>
<TE>   A significant exception to the sunny forecasts, however, was Intel
Corp.'s surprise warning last Thursday that the sales are likely to
be lower than expected in the second quarter, from $6.2 billion to
$6.5 billion, down from previous projections of $6.4 billion to $7
billion.</TE>
<TE>   The conflicting data reflect Intel's dependence on personal
computer sales. About 60% of Intel's revenue comes from desktop PCs,
while 20% comes from server computers, according to Mark Edelstone, a
semiconductor analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.</TE>
<TE>   Although consumer electronic sales are strong, PC sales lag as
companies wait to spend money until a broader economic recovery
begins. Consumers also have held back spending on PCs, making do with
their current machines.</TE>
<TE>   "PCs are going to be late in responding to the recovery," said
Roger Kay, director of client computing at IDC in Framingham, Mass.
Kay projects PC sales will inch up 4.7% this year with a return to
double-digit growth in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "Intel's a very large company, but 80% of its business is PC- and
server-related," said David Wu, vice president of research at Wedbush
Morgan Securities. "The other guys have a very broad customer base
beyond PCs."</TE>
<TE>   Chip companies that sell products in several sectors will do
better in a mixed recovery, Wu said.</TE>
<TE>   Motorola's Breen said the company is seeing improvements in all
their business segments. The company gets 53% of its revenue from
selling cellular handsets and cell phone equipment, 15% from
semiconductors, 14% from two-way radios, and the remainder from
batteries, cable modems and television set-top boxes.</TE>
<TE>   Breen said he expects Motorola to increase its global market share
for cell phones to 18% in the second quarter from 17% in the first
quarter amid a flat market.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the bottom line improvement comes from an effort to reduce
costs.</TE>
<TE>   The company expects to have 100,000 employees worldwide by the end
of this year, down from a peak of 150,000 in August 2000, said Scott
Wyman, a company spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Motorola's expected profit will not include one-time costs related
to job cuts and other charges, which could bring the company's
overall bottom line into the red.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Breen's comments buoyed Wall Street, which pushed
Motorola's stock up 8.7%, or $1.25, to $15.66 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Shares in Fairchild Semiconductor, which sees a
stronger-than-expected 3% to 5% increase in sales from new orders,
increased 65 cents, or 2.7%, to $25.20. Intel shares gained $1.36, or
6.7%, to $21.58, both on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>FERC OKs Upgrade of Electricity Route</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. energy regulators approved a $300-million project to ease
congestion on a California electric transmission route that's been
blamed for some of the blackouts during the state's power crisis last
year.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said the project,
announced by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham in October, will bring
more power to the northern part of the state.</LD>
<LD>   The California Public Utility Commission had requested that the
project be rejected because state regulators haven't shown it's
necessary.</LD>
<TE>   "The need of this line has been made and proven," FERC Chairman
Pat Wood said Wednesday at the commission's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Congestion on the existing transmission line, known as Path 15,
played a role in California's rolling blackouts last year. At that
time, capacity problems on Path 15 limited the flow of electricity to
Northern California from Southern California, which then had a
surplus of electricity.</TE>
<TE>   The existing line is owned by Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and is
located near Los Banos in California's Central Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Since the original October agreement, Kinder Morgan Inc., Williams
Cos., PG&amp;E Corp.'s National Energy Group and Transmission Agency of
Northern California have backed out of the project "for various
business reasons," said LaVerne Kyriss, a spokeswoman for the Western
Area Power Administration. The agency is part of the Energy
Department and is managing the project.</TE>
<TE>   Western Area Power Administration, which will spend about $1.5
million on the project, will own the new line and have the remaining
transmission rights, Kyriss said. The agency already operates 17,000
miles of transmission lines.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Trans-Elect Inc. and PG&amp;E Corp. utility Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric are building a new line and upgrading facilities. The
project, which will provide power for 1.5-million households, will be
completed by the summer of 2004, Kyriss said.</TE>
<TE>   Trans-Elect has agreed to pay for most of the project in exchange
for 72% of the transmission rights, which the company can use or
sell.</TE>

<LD>Milan Panic, the man who said he was "born to fight" even when it
wasn't a good idea, chose not to Wednesday, announcing that he would
step down as chairman and chief executive of ICN Pharmaceuticals
Inc., the company he began in Los Angeles 42 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Panic's decision, made just 15 days after dissident shareholders
took control of the ICN board of directors, marks the end of a
successful but controversial stewardship that saw the firm grow from
a $200 stake and a converted washing machine into a global,
research-based pharmaceutical business.</LD>
<LD>   "There are better things in life to do than to fight, and I am 72.
It's time for me to consider doing something else," Panic said in a
telephone interview Wednesday. "If it helps the company, then I will
do well [as a shareholder] and my grandchildren will do well."</LD>
<TE>   Just how well the Costa Mesa-based company will do without Panic
at the helm is uncertain. Many analysts had predicted that ICN stock
would rise once Panic's control over the company had ended, because
ICN's past was as colored by Panic's problems as anything else, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently Panic had endured growing shareholder anger over the
lack of speed in building the company's share price. Some
shareholders said he didn't move fast enough in executing his plan to
break the company up into three entities. Panic also drew fire when
he accepted a $33.1-million bonus for managing the spinoff of
Ribapharm Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Panic had also made enemies among federal regulators. In 1998,
Securities and Exchange Commission officials sought to have Panic
ousted in connection with alleged trading violations involving ICN
stock. The Food and Drug Administration recently reprimanded ICN and
other pharmaceutical companies for misleading consumers and doctors
in promoting their drugs.</TE>
<TE>   And in December, ICN agreed to plead guilty to securities fraud
for misleading investors about its successful hepatitis C drug
ribavirin, agreeing to pay a $5.6-million fine.</TE>
<TE>   Panic, a flamboyant multimillionaire who was born in Belgrade, has
had a career of intrigue and controversy.</TE>
<TE>   As a teenager during World War II, he was a member of the Yugoslav
resistance fighting Nazi occupation. Ten years later he defected from
the new Communist regime, moving his family to New York.</TE>
<TE>   Panic launched his company from a Los Angeles garage in 1959. Its
first product was commercialized DNA, which paved the way for later
antiviral drugs from ICN.</TE>
<TE>   In July 1992, Panic, a U.S. citizen, took leave from ICN and was
elected prime minister of Yugoslavia. He withstood two votes of no
confidence by the Belgrade legislature as he advocated for peace in
the region, but lost a power struggle for the presidency to Slobodan
Milosevic, who quickly pushed him from office.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, Panic's business and personal life have been
only slightly less turbulent.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, he settled at least four sexual harassment suits, in
one case paying $3.5 million to ICN's former director of employee
relations, Debra Levy. Last year a court ordered Panic to pay child
support to Levy after DNA tests confirmed he was the father of her
14-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   If shareholders were expecting a leap in ICN stock from Panic's
departure, that has not happened. On the New York Stock Exchange, ICN
finished up 27 cents Wednesday to $24.88, still below the $27.80
price on the day of the ICN shareholders vote.</TE>
<TE>   Other analysts cautioned against high expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "The pharmaceutical industry is out of favor right now," said
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. analyst Herman Saftlas. ICN has "spun off
Ribapharm, and what's left in their product pipeline is relatively
mundane and they will have competition in the hepatitis C market in
the coming months."</TE>
<TE>   Panic said that he would advise the ICN on matters, but "only if
they want me to. I want to make this clear. I am out," he said, even
though he will remain on the company's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   Panic said that he wants to work in the field of human rights and
said that he has been asked to assist the president of Yugoslavia.</TE>

<HD>Court OKs Pay Deal for Chief at Global</HD>
<DH>Telecom: John Legere will receive annual salary, bonus and
incentive payments of as much as $5.3 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The top executive trying to revamp Global Crossing Ltd.'s operations
will be paid as much as $5.3 million a year in salary, bonus and
retention incentives, under a package approved by a Bankruptcy Court
judge in New York.</LD>
<LD>   The court's ruling means that John J. Legere, installed last fall
as chief executive of the faltering fiber-optic networking company,
will get more than $7.5 million in cash payments withheld pending the
court's decision.</LD>
<LD>   That money consists of a $3.5-million signing bonus, nearly the
same amount to cover taxes on the bonus and the rest in back pay. In
January, he received nearly $4.8 million to cover taxes on a
$15-million loan from a subsidiary.</LD>
<TE>   The contract approved by the court includes a quarterly $800,000
payment to encourage him to stay and help revive the company. The
so-called retention payment is one of the new twists on a generous
compensation package that also includes stock options, a potentially
lucrative perk should Legere be able to restructure the company.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing, whose Jan. 28 filing for bankruptcy protection
marked the nation's biggest telecommunications collapse, also would
pay Legere as much as $4 million if he can help the firm obtain up to
$1.3 billion in new financing or in proceeds from the sale of the
company or its assets.</TE>
<TE>   The company's bankers and unsecured creditors had been at odds
over Legere's pay. Bankers, who favor selling the company as soon as
is practical, wanted a much smaller package. Other creditors, though,
figure that any return they get in the future would be worth more
than they could get now: The proceeds from any sale would go first to
repay loans before they recover anything.</TE>
<TE>   Unsecured creditors favor a long-term plan to turn around Global.
The company itself is proposing that it seek new investors and
continue as an independent telecommunications enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, the banks probably need Legere in place through any
possible sale.</TE>
<TE>   "He's helping to try to create value that someone else would pay
for," one person involved in the bankruptcy proceedings said
Wednesday. "The banks can't afford to have him walk away now."</TE>
<TE>   The fluid nature of bankruptcy proceedings could lead some banks
to lend more money and become longer-term players.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing did not comment.</TE>
<TE>   Legere's salary of $1.1 million a year was reduced 30% after the
bankruptcy petition was filed to $770,000 until a reorganization plan
is approved or a sale is made. That remains the same under the
revised contract. His quarterly retention payments of $800,000 begin
Aug. 1. He will receive a bonus of 125% of the original $1.1-million
salary if certain performance goals are met--a bonus of $1.375
million.</TE>
<TE>   Those three provisions give him more than $5.3 million a year.
Besides the possible $4-million fee, he also will have a company-paid
$6-million life insurance policy.</TE>
<TE>   Legere will have to cover more of his own taxes from what was
designed as a $15-million loan that he did not have to repay. The
loan came from his prior position as CEO at Asia Global Crossing
Ltd., Global's 58%-owned subsidiary.</TE>
<TE>   The parent company, on hiring him, agreed to pay $13.5 million in
taxes and had paid nearly $4.8 million to date. Under the court-
approved deal, Legere will have to pay the remainder himself.</TE>

<HD>Stewart Still Firmly Planted</HD>
<DH>Media: Reports of insider trading are denied, though
company's stock falls. Demand for brand will stay strong, analysts
say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Martha Stewart were just about anyone else, she'd be in real
trouble.</LD>
<LD>   Magazine advertising, the anchor of her empire, has fallen
dramatically. Kmart Corp., the exclusive retailer of her products,
filed for bankruptcy protection in January. An unauthorized and
unflattering biography of her has been at the top of the bestseller
lists. And now questions are being raised over whether she used
inside information to sell shares of ImClone Systems Inc. just before
the stock took a dive.</LD>
<LD>   But Martha Stewart isn't just anyone else.</LD>
<TE>   Even as Wall Street sold off shares of her namesake company in
droves Wednesday--driving Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. shares
down $2.10 to close at $15, on volume more than 16 times higher than
average--most analysts agreed that investors would come back.</TE>
<TE>   That's because no matter what business, market or government
forces say about Stewart, millions of women and a fair number of men
across America continue to look to her and her products for their own
personal homemaking salvation.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of demand for Martha Stewart and her branded
products--that's really the issue here," said Jeffrey Klinefelter, an
analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis, after
Stewart's presentation Wednesday at the Piper Jaffray investor
conference in New York. "That will bring investors back. Right now
the market is very skittish and has knee-jerk reactions to negative
news."</TE>
<TE>   Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia is the umbrella organization for
all things Martha, including three magazines, a "how-to" television
show with six weekly episodes, a weekly appearance on CBS' "This
Morning," a cable TV cooking show, 34 books that have sold more than
10 million copies, a weekly newspaper column, a radio program and
more than 5,000 Martha Stewart products sold through direct mail or,
in the United States, at Kmart stores.</TE>
<TE>   The company's trouble Wednesday came as a result of Stewart's
close ties to Samuel Waksal, ImClone's former chief executive who was
arrested Wednesday on charges of conspiracy, securities fraud and
perjury related to an alleged insider trading scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Reports last week detailed Stewart's sale of 3,928 shares of
ImClone stock the day before the Food and Drug Administration
rejected the application for approval of ImClone's experimental
cancer drug, sending the pharmaceutical company's stock plummeting.</TE>
<TE>   Shares in Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia have fallen almost 21%
since those reports surfaced.</TE>
<TE>   Still, analysts said that for the moment, Wall Street is far more
concerned than Main Street with Stewart's proximity to ImClone.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an issue most of America either doesn't know about or
doesn't care about," said Alissa Goldwasser, a media analyst with
William Blair in Chicago. "I believe there is a tremendous
opportunity for the shares to rebound. I think it's misplaced concern
on the part of investors."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, most analysts say, the only real danger to Martha Stewart
Living Omnimedia is Stewart herself. As critics of the company have
long charged, Stewart is so identified with every single aspect of
the company that many question whether it can continue without her.</TE>
<TE>   Goldwasser said company executives are hoping to ensure the
ongoing health of the company whether she is around or not, as
Kentucky Fried Chicken did without Colonel Sanders. But that
transition is no easy feat.</TE>
<TE>   "I perceive a balancing act between having her as a charismatic
spokeswoman and ensuring the long-lived nature of the brand,"
Goldwasser said. "The key thing is to change her from a celebrity
into an icon. I think they're very aware and very focused on it."</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, however, the company is focused on putting to rest
any notion of impropriety on Stewart's part. Congressional
investigators have asked Stewart for her phone records in connection
with her ImClone trades.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement released Wednesday, Stewart said she had directed
her broker to sell her remaining ImClone shares if the stock fell
below $60. Her broker called Dec. 27 to advise that the shares had
fallen below that mark and Stewart sold her stake at $58.</TE>
<TE>   "After directing my broker to sell, I placed a call to Dr.
Waksal's office to inquire about ImClone," Stewart said. "I did not
reach Dr. Waksal and he did not return my call. In placing my trade I
had no improper information. My transaction was entirely lawful."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the ImClone imbroglio comes at a time when the
fundamentals are improving for Stewart's company. The advertising
market is rebounding, Kmart is locked into a minimum payment
guarantee and other retail suitors continue to wait hungrily in the
wings.</TE>
<TE>   The company in April announced first-quarter earnings of $2.9
million on sales of $68.7 million, beating Wall Street earnings
estimates by a penny a share, though still half the profit of the
same period a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1997, the company has increased sales by an average of 23%
annually, and earnings per share by about 18% per year. In 2001, the
company posted net income of $21.9 million on sales of nearly $296
million.</TE>
<TE>   But at a time when investors are nervous about any perceived
impropriety, Stewart's extensive creation is being punished for
something that will likely amount to nothing, analyst Klinefelter
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It probably presents a pretty compelling buying opportunity," he
said.</TE>

<DH>Internet: Plans by Universal and Sony to cut download
prices draw praise from some artists, but fate of albums remains an
issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY, CHUCK PHILIPS and P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the decision to offer tens of thousands of songs online, the
world's two largest record companies have steered onto an unlit road
with no clear destination.</LD>
<LD>   Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment revealed plans
this week to make much of their catalogs available for download at a
discount, going far beyond the major labels' previous--and as yet
unsuccessful--experiments in online distribution.</LD>
<LD>   Although the move drew praise from recording artists, retailers
and Internet music advocates, it also raised questions about the fate
of full-length albums and the companies' ability to succeed online in
the face of rampant Internet piracy.</LD>
<TE>   Those questions are difficult to answer, even by industry
executives involved in digital downloads for years.</TE>
<TE>   The companies' plans came as the Department of Justice interviewed
artists' representatives as part of an antitrust investigation into
the major record companies' online ventures.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said a team of federal officials looked for evidence of
anti-competitive practices in the way the companies distribute music
online--particularly through their own services.</TE>
<TE>   The initiatives by Universal and Sony do not rely on the
companies' jointly owned online distribution service, Pressplay.
Instead, they use independent distributors Liquid Audio Inc. and
RioPort Inc.</TE>
<TE>   By making a large selection of songs available in a format that
allows CD burning, the two companies are trying to offer consumers
something close to what they've gotten free from such online
file-sharing networks as Napster, Kazaa and Morpheus.</TE>
<TE>   "So now the major labels' message to the consumer is: 'Download
from us so that artists and songwriters get paid,' " said pop star
Don Henley. "To me, the issue is how much do they intend to pay the
artists. I suspect very little, if history is any gauge."</TE>
<TE>   So far, artist representatives say, Universal labels are proposing
fair royalty fees to acts with music sold through the new system.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposal, an artist signed to a contract with an 18%
royalty would receive 18 cents on the dollar for every track
downloaded--after reimbursing the label for recording costs, sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   That's significantly higher than what an artist receives under the
CD model, which, after packaging and "free goods" deductions, would
amount to about 9 cents per $1 single.</TE>
<TE>   Universal plans to make as much of its library of songs available
for downloading as possible, including new releases, starting later
this summer.</TE>
<TE>   The price is expected to be 99 cents per song and $9.99 per album,
and buyers will be able to burn the songs they download onto CD--a
major shift in the company's policy.</TE>
<TE>   Sony said it will increase significantly the number of
downloadable songs, cut the price 25% and enable burning. By letting
consumers buy individual tracks, rather than bundling them all into
albums, the companies could create new problems for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The industry has used singles--and lately, individual songs
released only to radio stations--as a promotional tool to induce
consumers to buy the full album. Labels rely on the higher price tag
of an album to recoup the cost of promoting an artist and cover
publishing fees, among other things.</TE>
<TE>   Many consumers who use file-sharing networks say they have no
other way to acquire the songs they want without paying for the ones
they don't. But if the labels persuade those consumers to pay for
downloadable tracks, they could undermine the bundling that's key to
their business models.</TE>
<TE>   "When you punt the bundle, that's when the trouble starts," said
Jim Griffin, chief executive of Cherry Lane Digital, a Los Angeles
media and technology consulting firm. "You cannot price a single low
enough to attract fans to buy it, or high enough for the labels to
cover the cost of developing an artist."</TE>
<TE>   Several artists and artist managers said they were not worried
about the effect downloaded singles might have on the album market.
Survival in a single-heavy sales world might push artists and
companies to produce better material, several managers said. It also
could prove to be prudent for the industry, allowing labels to return
to signing acts to modest single deals instead of costly long-term
album agreements.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a great exploratory step," said Scott Welch of
Mosaic Media Group, which represents Alanis Morissette, OutKast and
the Goo Goo Dolls. "It will force artists to create better songs and
companies to sell better content. The fact is if we don't start
making some concrete changes to give fans what they want, then all
we're doing is rearranging the deck chairs on the Titantic."</TE>
<TE>   Executives at several independent labels and online services that
offer downloadable singles say there just isn't enough data to tell
what effect the moves by Universal and Sony will have on CD sales.</TE>
<TE>   Matador Records, an independent label that already has made much
of its catalog available for downloading, said "it's really hard to
quantify" the effect of downloads on CD sales, if any.</TE>
<TE>   The only approach that seems to have worked is EMusic's
subscription service, which lets users download an unlimited number
of songs for a flat fee, said Patrick Amory, Matador's general
manager.</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, the new system will resolve several ethical
issues surrounding digital downloading, said artist manager Cliff
Burnstein.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing this will do is cut through the hypocrisy by giving
people the option of whether they want to buy or steal music," said
Burnstein, who along with Peter Mench runs Q-Prime, the agency that
represents Metallica and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't have to listen to anymore of that b.s. like 'I was
forced to download the single because the album had only one good
track on it,' " he added. "Now that you can buy your favorite single
for 99 cents, what's the argument going to be? We'll get down to the
truth, which is: 'I want it free. I'm too cheap to pay 99
cents....Screw the artists.' "</TE>

<HD>Insider Trading an Issue That Won't Go Away</HD>
<DH>Securities: It's not like the 1980s, but such cases are
increasing after years of decline, experts say.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though it generates far fewer headlines than in the days of Ivan
Boesky, insider trading has remained a persistent and serious problem
in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   As Wednesday's charges against Samuel Waksal, former chief
executive of ImClone Systems Inc., demonstrate, securities regulators
continue to pursue people suspected of illegally using confidential
information to reap easy profits in the stock market.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, experts say that after a decline in the early and
mid-1990s, insider trading on Wall Street has increased in recent
years, primarily among mid-level employees who assume they're too far
down the corporate totem pole to be detected. There also has been an
increase in the number of offshore cases in which foreign citizens
trade U.S. stocks on confidential information, experts said.</LD>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission brought 57 insider-trading
cases in 2001, compared with 40 cases in 2000 and 29 cases in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "It continues to be a problem," said Stephen Cutler, chief of the
SEC's enforcement unit. "Despite the many cases we've brought in this
area, some people just don't seem to get it. Either they think
they're going to get away with it or they ... don't think of it as a
violation of the law."</TE>
<TE>   In one example, adult film star Kathryn Gannon this week pleaded
guilty to federal charges that she traded stocks on confidential
information leaked to her by former Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.
Chief Executive James McDermott.</TE>
<TE>   McDermott, the first CEO of a Wall Street investment bank to be
charged with insider trading, admitted last year that he tipped
Gannon to pending bank mergers. He was sentenced to five months in
prison. She faces sentencing Sept. 20.</TE>
<TE>   In January, a case was filed against a former Wall Street analyst
who allegedly tipped off a friend to nonpublic information on several
upcoming mergers between public companies. The friend sold shares in
those companies, making profits.</TE>
<TE>   So far, no one is forecasting a repeat of the late 1980s, when a
rash of insider-trading scandals rocked Wall Street. Ivan Boesky, an
arbitrageur who agreed to pay $100 million to settle insider-trading
charges stemming from stock transactions in mergers and takeovers
that weren't public knowledge yet, came to symbolize the era's
insider-trading scandals.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't seen in recent years very high-profile players charged
and convicted ... but it still goes on and it's something we continue
to investigate and prosecute regularly," said James B. Comey, U.S.
attorney for the Southern District of New York.</TE>
<TE>   Securities lawyers said the bursting of the late '90s stock market
bubble has prompted a new type of insider-trading case. These are
typically part of a broader case of financial-reporting fraud
occurring at a company, rather than isolated cases involving a few
individuals.</TE>
<TE>   "We are seeing insider trading in connection with schemes to
manipulate a public company's stock price through falsifying offering
statements and [other financial documents filed with the SEC]," said
Jeff Isaacs, deputy chief of the major fraud section for the U.S.
attorney's office in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In these cases, insiders try to artificially inflate their
company's stock, then dump their shares at a profit before the price
falls, he said.</TE>
<TE>   For regulators, insider-trading charges can be easier to prove
than far more complicated cases involving accounting fraud and other
white-collar crime, said Boris Feldman, a securities law attorney at
Wilson Sonsini Goodrich Rosati in Palo Alto.</TE>
<TE>   "Insider-trading charges are more understandable to a jury and
easier for a prosecutor to establish than a complicated accounting
scheme," Feldman said.</TE>
<TE>   There hasn't been a rash of new insider-trading cases on the West
Coast, said Randall Lee, head of the SEC office in Los Angeles, but
such cases still are a core area of investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators also are trying to crack down on legal forms of insider
trading that may be perceived as unfair to investors. The SEC in
April approved a rule that would require companies to disclose stock
trades by top executives within as little as two days.</TE>
<TE>   The new rule was prompted in part by Enron Corp.'s collapse. Just
before the company crumbled, there were heavy stock sales by
insiders. While apparently legal, the sales were widely seen as
giving the Enron insiders a chance to preserve profits while
individual investors were caught when the stock subsequently plunged.</TE>
<TE>   In the ImClone case, the SEC alleges that Waksal gave negative
insider information regarding his company to family members, who sold
ImClone stock before the news became public.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the biggest insider-trading cases in years," said
Stephen Bainbridge, a UCLA law professor who wrote a textbook on
insider trading.</TE>
<TE>   "The SEC is under a lot of pressure these days to take an activist
role. People's stock portfolios are down 2 1/2 years running. They
want to see some heads chopped off."</TE>

<HD>Bank Insurance Fund Dips Below Key Level</HD>
<DH>Financial services: The drop raises the prospect that the
FDIC may have to levy fees on institutions next year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's Bank Insurance Fund has fallen below its required level
for the first time since 1995, regulators said Wednesday, increasing
the chance of new fees on banks to replenish the fund, reformation of
the deposit-insurance system, or both.</LD>
<LD>   Experts see no widespread problems for banks, however. Although
the recession has hurt some institutions, total bank earnings were
$21.7 billion in the first quarter this year--the first time
quarterly profits exceeded $20 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Despite six bank failures in the first quarter, "the system is in
pretty good shape," and consumers with insured deposits have nothing
to fear, said Alexandria, Va., banking consultant Bert Ely.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the decline in Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. reserve
ratios, which began three years ago, has bankers, regulators and
legislators agreeing that changes to the deposit insurance status quo
are inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   The consensus: The FDIC will impose modest new assessments on
banks next year, and Congress ultimately will grant the FDIC greater
latitude in setting reserve levels and bank premiums. A near
certainty, the experts say, is a merger of the Bank Insurance Fund
with the Savings Assn. Insurance Fund, which covers savings and loans
and is better capitalized.</TE>
<TE>   If the two government funds were merged, their combined insurance
reserves would total 1.27% of all deposits, said Kevin Brown, a
senior analyst for the FDIC. The minimum ratio presumed healthy under
current rules is 1.25%; the bank fund declined to 1.24% in the first
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Bank Insurance Fund grew by $258 million during the
quarter, to $30.7 billion, that wasn't enough to offset the
$75-billion increase in insured funds.</TE>
<TE>   In a report on the insurance fund, FDIC Chairman Don Powell said
the biggest contributor to declining reserve ratios is a more
accurate method of estimating insured deposits at banks. The change,
which took effect this year, accounted for two-thirds of the
$75-billion increase in insured deposits last quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Ely expects political infighting in Congress, along with more
pressing concerns such as homeland security, to delay adoption of a
deposit insurance bill beyond the current year. That will leave the
FDIC to take steps to ensure the current deficit in reserves doesn't
grow.</TE>
<TE>   James Chessen, chief economist with the American Bankers Assn.,
said he expects the agency's list of "troubled" banks, which require
separate FDIC reserves, to begin declining later this year. That
could free up additional FDIC funds to replenish the insurance fund.</TE>
<TE>   At the most, experts say the FDIC will impose assessments of only
1 or 2 basis points--a penny or two per $100 in deposits--next year,
to bring the insurance fund to the required 1.25% level.</TE>
<TE>   "We are talking peanuts" at that level, Ely said. "The banking
industry in the early '90s was paying 23 basis points a year--for
four years."</TE>
<TE>   Those payments were part of a plan to replenish an insurance
system battered by years of heavy losses at commercial banks and
savings and loans. By 1996, the bank fund exceeded the 1.25%
threshold, a level at which healthy banks no longer were required to
pay premiums.</TE>
<TE>   Only 8% of the nation's banks currently contribute to the fund.</TE>
<TE>   Chessen credited the FDIC for helping troubled institutions
resolve their problems through recapitalizations or acquisitions. He
said, though, that the FDIC now has too much money--$1.3 billion--set
aside for bank failures, and that the nearly $31 billion in the Bank
Insurance Fund is more than enough.</TE>
<TE>   Bankers are split on one item in proposed legislation: increasing
the deposit insurance amount to $130,000 per account, which would
increase the need for FDIC reserves. Large banks--which can raise
funds by issuing commercial paper and through brokered
accounts--generally oppose higher limits. Community banks,
particularly in rural areas, generally support them.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Couple Can Sue Bochco</HD>
<DH>Courts: A federal appeals panel restores a lawsuit that
accuses the TV producer of copying an idea for 'City of Angels.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an embarrassment for A-list TV producer Steven Bochco, a federal
appeals court Wednesday ruled that his defunct CBS hospital drama,
"City of Angels," bore a "striking" resemblance to a series idea
allegedly pitched to him a decade ago by a Los Angeles couple.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling reinstates a lawsuit
filed by businessman Jerome C. Metcalf and his wife, Laurie, in March
2000, alleging Bochco infringed on their idea. That lawsuit was
tossed out last year by a federal judge.</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday's ruling does not mean that Bochco was found to have
copied their idea, only that the Metcalfs have a right to sue him
over it. In addition to reinstating the lawsuit, the ruling also
reverses the judge's order that the Metcalfs pay Bochco more than
$83,000 in lawyer fees.</LD>
<TE>   In his ruling, Judge Robert J. Kelleher wrote that the case should
be reinstated because of "the presence of so many generic
similarities" and said that "the similarities between the relevant
works are striking." The court also said that Bochco conceded he had
access to the Metcalfs' proposals, and that an actor in the show read
three versions of the scripts, submitted them to Bochco and that
Bochco liked them.</TE>
<TE>   "The numerous similarities between their work and what ultimately
became 'City of Angels' showed them their work had been infringed,"
said Robert F. Helfing, who represented the couple.</TE>
<TE>   But Bochco's lawyer, Edward A. Ruttenberg, said the ruling is
legally faulty and full of errors. He said that Bochco never conceded
that he saw the Metcalfs' proposal, adding that the producer formed
the idea long before they did.</TE>
<TE>   Ruttenberg added that the concept of a TV show set in an urban
hospital is a generic idea that can't be copyrighted, citing such
examples as "St. Elsewhere" and "ER."</TE>
<TE>   Ruttenberg said he will probably ask that the decision be reheard,
or that a larger, 11-member panel of judges hear the case. "If we
have to go to trial, we'll go to trial and we'll win," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bochco is one of television's elite, powerful executives who
create, write and produce top shows for networks. His credits include
"Hill Street Blues," "NYPD Blue" and "L.A. Law."</TE>
<TE>   In their lawsuit, the Metcalfs alleged that the series about an
urban hospital featuring a largely African American cast was based on
pitches they made to Bochco in the early 1990s through actor Michael
L. Warren, who ultimately starred in the show.</TE>
<TE>   "City of Angels" starred such actors as Blair Underwood, Warren
and Vivica A. Fox when it debuted in 2000. Despite such honors as
NAACP Image Awards, it was canceled later that year amid poor
ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Metcalf has alleged he first got the idea for the show after
reading two newspaper articles in November 1989 about the military
training doctors at urban hospitals and pitched the idea to Warren, a
social acquaintance who was one of the stars of "Hill Street Blues."</TE>

<HD>Economy Shows Modest, Uneven Gains in May</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's economic recovery progressed at a modest pace in late
April and May, although improvements were spotty, the Federal Reserve
said Wednesday in its latest snapshot of business activity around the
country.</LD>
<LD>   "The tone was one of modest but uneven growth, with some major
sectors showing signs of improvement while others softened or
remained weak," the Fed said in its "beige book" survey.</LD>
<LD>   Manufacturers--hardest hit by last year's recession--reported
higher production levels, shipments and orders, but there were
pockets of weakness. Suppliers of aircraft parts in Boston and San
Francisco said orders were down. Manufacturers in Philadelphia,
Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco said demand for telecommunications
equipment remained weak.</LD>
<TE>   Retail sales were flat in most areas, hampered by unusually cool
weather in some parts of the country. Automobile sales were mixed.</TE>
<TE>   On the real estate front, home sales mostly stayed robust as low
mortgage rates motivated buyers.</TE>
<TE>   But commercial properties continued to struggle, with most areas
reporting high vacancy rates and lower rental rates.</TE>
<TE>   The jobs market was sluggish, though the Boston, Philadelphia,
Richmond, Va., and Atlanta Fed districts reported higher demand for
temporary workers, an encouraging sign for future job growth.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed survey is based on information collected before June 3
from the Fed's 12 regional bank districts. It will be used by Fed
policymakers when they meet June 25-26 to discuss interest rate
policy. Most economists predict the Fed will leave short-term
interest rates--now at 40-year lows--unchanged through the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the Labor Department said import prices were unchanged
in May as falling costs for cars and capital goods offset price
increases for petroleum and industrial supplies.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Leo Kirch, the founder of Germany's second-largest media company,
sought protection from creditors for the rest of his business in the
country's biggest bankruptcy filing since World War II.</LD>
<LD>   Kirch Holding and its investment arm filed for insolvency, a
Munich court said. Kirch's other businesses--Europe's No. 1 film
library and a pay-television unit whose investors include Rupert
Murdoch--collapsed in April and May.</LD>
<LD>   The Munich-based company, which owns the broadcasting rights to
the soccer World Cup and has film contracts with Hollywood studios
including Walt Disney Co., is disintegrating after a four-decade
expansion led to $5.7 billion in debt and mounting losses. More than
80 companies, including Sony Corp.'s Columbia Pictures, are
interested in buying what's left.</LD>
<TE>   Kirch, 75, stepped down as chief executive in April to pave the
way for new management to sell the remains of the film rights company
he founded in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   Assets on sale include a film and TV library. Kirch also owns a
controlling stake in the company that runs Formula One racing and
more than 50% in Germany's biggest TV broadcaster.</TE>

<HD>Small Video Stores Fight Blockbuster in Court</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mom-and-pop video store operators prepared to battle Blockbuster Inc.
in federal court, alleging the video rental giant conspired with
movie studios to drive independent stores out of business.</LD>
<LD>   Blockbuster, the world's biggest video rental chain, rejects the
plaintiffs' charges that it broke antitrust laws by signing deals
with the studios that enabled it to obtain large numbers of new video
releases at low prices unavailable to independent retailers.</LD>
<LD>   Harry Munsinger, lead attorney for the three independent video
store plaintiffs in the case, said the revenue-sharing deals that
Blockbuster signed around 1997 marked the end of free and fair
competition in the video rental industry.</LD>
<TE>   Blockbuster, which has about 8,000 stores worldwide, said the
deals were normal commercial agreements that laid the foundation for
a dramatic turnaround in the Dallas-based company's fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   Jury selection for the trial began in U.S. District Court in San
Antonio. The plaintiffs in the case are Lone Star Videotronics of San
Antonio, Phoenix-Merchant Investments of Sacramento and the Big
Picture Video of Syracuse, N.Y.</TE>

<HD>CEO, President of Janus Capital Management Will Step Down</HD>
<DH>Executives: Tom Bailey, founder of its Janus Fund, will
remain chairman. The investment advisor is reorganizing as its funds
continue to slump.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tom Bailey, who launched the Janus Fund with a handful of investors
in 1969 and helped make it into a mutual fund powerhouse, said
Wednesday that he will step down as chief executive and president of
Janus Capital Management at the end of the month.</LD>
<LD>   Bailey, 64, decided to stop running Janus' daily operations after
investment director Helen Young Hayes and research director Jim Goff
began overseeing the investment team in January, spokeswoman Jane
Ingalls said. Bailey will remain chairman of Janus' funds, and a
five-person committee will manage Janus during the search for a new
chief executive.</LD>
<LD>   Denver-based Janus, the sixth-largest fund group, is overhauling
management as investors flee its slumping funds.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, Janus clients withdrew $12.1 billion from its stock and
bond funds, the largest net outflow among the 25 biggest U.S. fund
firms, according to Boston-based consulting firm Financial Research
Corp. Investors said Janus, whose growth was fueled by rapidly rising
technology stocks in the 1990s, may continue to diversify by adding
more shares of companies with slower, more consistent growth.</TE>
<TE>   There is no clear successor to Bailey, industry experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Hayes nor Goff is likely to be tapped CEO, said fund
industry consultant Geoff Bobroff. He predicted that Janus and its
parent firm Stilwell Financial Inc. will look outside for a chief
executive.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the big challenges that they have, and they clearly
recognize it, is the culture at Janus is very unique, and it's going
to take a fair amount of time to find someone," Bobroff told Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bailey last year said he intended to remain as chief
executive even after selling his stake in the money manager, some
investors said the sale made his departure a foregone conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   Janus had the fastest growth rate from 1996 to 2000 among mutual
fund groups with at least $25 billion under management, according to
Financial Research. The company's focus on tech stocks such as Nokia,
Cisco Systems Inc. and AOL Time Warner Inc. made its funds top
performers.</TE>
<TE>   But as the tech and telecom sectors led declines in U.S. stock
markets starting in March 2001, Janus' performance slid sharply,
leading to investors' massive withdrawals. Assets under management at
Janus dropped by more than half to $159 billion as of May 31, from
$330 billion at their peak in March 2000, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Janus handed stock investors the biggest average loss among the 20
largest fund families in 2001 for the second straight year, according
to a study by Boston-based investment management firm Kanon Bloch
Carre. Its diversified U.S. stock funds lost a weighted average of
24% last year, the study said.</TE>
<TE>   Janus has diversified its investments in the last year, reducing
its concentration in tech companies and increasing its
"value"-oriented holdings such as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. Bailey founded Janus with about 30 investors and $500,000 in
assets. In 1983, railroad operator Kansas City Southern Industries
Inc. bought a majority stake in the money manager, which it spun off
in 2000 along with other financial services business under the
Stilwell umbrella.</TE>
<TE>   Stilwell shares fell 43 cents to $19.13 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The stock is down 41.6% in the last year, more than twice
the decline of the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Higher After Volatile Trading Day</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Investors stage late buying spree despite
insider-trading charges at ImClone Systems and new profit warnings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks sprinted higher in a late rally Wednesday as investors, lured
by beaten-down prices, put aside their worries over a tepid corporate
profit picture and a stream of accounting scandals.</LD>
<LD>   Optimistic earnings forecasts from consumer goods giant Procter &amp;
Gamble and mobile phone maker Motorola gave investors encouragement,
and Microsoft led a surge in the final hour as traders speculated
that the world's biggest software maker might raise profit
projections.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 100.45 points, or 1.1%,
to 9,617.71 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained
21.94 points, or 1.5%, to 1,519.12.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts pointed to two encouraging signs: Both indexes closed
near their highs for the day, and trading volume was heavy. However,
despite the late-day rally, declining issues outnumbered advancers on
Nasdaq and were about even on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose a narrow 0.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Uncertainty over the corporate profit picture kept a cap on gains.
Analysts said doubts about the trustworthiness of corporate America
also gripped investors, heightened by insider trading charges brought
Wednesday against Samuel D. Waksal, former president and CEO of
biotechnology company ImClone Systems.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason to be optimistic is the economy and the market are
correlated," Chris Baggini, manager of the Gartmore Growth fund, told
Bloomberg News. "Consumers are going to start to move the whole
train."</TE>
<TE>   But some analysts discounted the day's gains, attributing them to
the trading practice of short covering. Short covering occurs when
traders are forced to buy stock to replace shares borrowed earlier
and sold "short" on the expectation of further declines.</TE>
<TE>   "People are buying back to get even," said Bryan Piskorowski,
market commentator at Prudential Securities. ''This is no brave new
world. One day of short covering in June is not the silver bullet for
the market."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, the Dow was down nearly 70 points as the
market was buffeted by bad news. But investors were encouraged when
the S&amp;P 500 managed to hold above the psychologically key 1,000 mark,
traders said.</TE>
<TE>   Tech heavyweights such as Microsoft, which surged $2.97 to $55.54,
and Intel, up $1.36 to $21.58, helped lead the way into positive
territory.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading, Treasury bond yields were little changed. The
U.S. dollar rallied against the yen and euro.</TE>
<TE>   Among other market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Maytag rose $2.97 to $45.27 a day after the appliance maker said
it will earn more than previously forecast. Rival Whirlpool jumped
$1.78 to $68.86.</TE>
<TE>   Other consumer-related companies that rose included Procter &amp;
Gamble, up $4 to $93; Coca-Cola, up 48 cents to $54.44; and Wal-Mart
Stores, up $1.85 to $58.30.</TE>
<TE>   * In the tech sector, Motorola soared $1.21 to $15.66 after saying
it will meet or exceed its forecasts this quarter, and Advanced Micro
Devices rose 34 cents to $9.67 after Prudential Securities raised its
rating on the chip maker's shares to "hold" from "sell."</TE>
<TE>   But the overall tech outlook remains murky: Siebel Systems sank
$2.48 to $15.18 after warning that its current quarter looks weak.</TE>
<TE>   * Advertising giant Omnicom Group plummeted $15.28 to $62.28 after
the Wall Street Journal said the company's practice of making
payments for acquisitions over several years may understate
liabilities. Omnicom called the article "inaccurate."</TE>
<TE>   * CMS Energy Corp. dropped $2.10, or 14%, to $13.01, after Moody's
Investors Service cut its rating on the power company's unsecured
debt from Ba3 to B3, making it a low junk grade.</TE>
<TE>   * Clear Channel Communications, Viacom and other media stocks fell
on concern about accounting issues, the economy and another wave of
consolidation in the radio industry. Clear Channel lost $3.91 to
$45.89, Viacom fell $2.30 to $46.60, and newspaper publisher Dow
Jones lost $1.86 to $51.26 after saying second-quarter profit will
miss analysts' forecasts because of lower ad sales.</TE>
<TE>   * In Europe, France's CAC-40 dropped 2.6%, Britain's FTSE 100 slid
1.7% and Germany's DAX index lost 2.1%. In other foreign trading,
Japan's Nikkei-225 index dropped 1.1%.</TE>

<HD>Judge Refuses to Dismiss Microsoft Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KRIM</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- A federal judge refused to dismiss the Microsoft Corp.
antitrust case Wednesday, handing a victory to state prosecutors
seeking stiffer sanctions on the company than it agreed to in a
settlement with the Justice Department.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly rejected the company's
argument that the states had no legal right to pursue national
antitrust sanctions. But her opinion was less an endorsement of state
authority and more a procedural ruling that the issue already had
been decided by other courts involved in the case.</LD>
<LD>   Last summer a federal appeals court ruled that Microsoft broke
antitrust laws, but it rejected a lower court's order to break up the
company. Instead, it sent the case back for hearings on how
Microsoft's conduct should be rectified.</LD>
<TE>   "This court is loath to presume, as Microsoft does, that the court
of appeals did not consider the jurisdictional issue of standing,"
the judge wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The decision means that the states' case can continue, though the
judge has yet to rule on several other pending Microsoft motions
that, were she to grant them, would eviscerate the sanctions sought
by the states.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides are scheduled to present closing arguments next
week.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa Atty. Gen. Tom Miller said the decision "confirms the
rightful role of state attorneys general to prosecute antitrust
violations."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said that "while we'd hoped for a
different outcome, ... we did raise some important constitutional and
policy issues with the court."</TE>
<TE>   The judge offered few clues in her decision about how she might
ultimately decide the case. But she hinted strongly that she is still
considering whether the Justice Department's view of how the case
should be resolved ought to take precedence in the rare cases in
which there is disagreement between states and the federal
government.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Justice Department and Microsoft have made that argument
in seeking to persuade Kollar-Kotelly to accept their settlement
deal.</TE>

<LD>UAL Corp.'s United Airlines will seek a U.S. loan guarantee to help
secure new financing if the world's second-largest airline's
employees agree to pay and benefit concessions, Chief Executive Jack
Creighton said.</LD>
<LD>   United had said it might apply for the assistance. Creighton said
UAL is making progress in concession talks with the pilots union and
met with the union representing mechanics and baggage handlers. The
carrier is close to reaching agreements with workers who aren't
represented by a union, he said.</LD>
<LD>   United has said it needs several billion dollars in labor cost
reductions in the next few years. Creighton reiterated that UAL
expects a loss in the current quarter and for the year. UAL's daily
losses are now "significantly" lower than the $5 million in the first
quarter, he said.</LD>

<HD>Japan Delays Tariffs on Steel From U.S.</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a temporary victory for U.S. steel, Japan said it would delay
slapping U.S. imports with 100% tariffs in a bid to ease the growing
steel row with its biggest trade partner.</LD>
<LD>   Japan had threatened the retaliatory measures on June 18 if the
United States failed to exclude Japanese products from safeguard
tariffs levied in March by President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   But Trade Minister Takeo Hiranuma called off the plan after a
phone conversation with U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Delta Air Lines Inc. expects a second-quarter loss of $170 million,
excluding one-time items, because of lower fares and revenue after
the Sept. 11 attacks, Chief Executive Leo Mullin said.</LD>
<LD>   "Despite 17 attempted fare increases over the past 30 days, none
has succeeded," Mullin told investors attending a Merrill Lynch
transportation conference. Delta shares fell $1.41 to $23.10 on the
NYSE.</LD>
<LD>   The loss will be about $1.38 a share, based on the 123.2-million
shares outstanding at the end of the first quarter. Analysts were
expecting the carrier to have a loss of $1.43 a share.</LD>

<LD>   * Crown Cork &amp; Seal Co., the maker of about a fifth of the world's
cans, said a court dismissed 376 pending asbestos cases against the
company related to a 1963 acquisition. The Philadelphia Court of

Pennsylvania corporate law that limits a successor company's asbestos
liability to the total value of the acquired company's assets.</LD>

<LD>   CFTC enforcement officials are reviewing hundreds of thousands of

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kmart Corp. filed its official restated earnings for the first three
quarters of 2001, reflecting changes in the way it reports vendor
discounts.</LD>
<LD>   The first-quarter net loss is $233 million, restated from a loss
of $25 million.</LD>
<LD>   For the second quarter, Kmart reported a loss of $377 million
instead of the previously reported loss of $95 million; and its
restated loss for the third quarter was $235 million instead of $224
million.</LD>
<TE>   Kmart has said that because of its bankruptcy filing and
uncertainty of its future relationships with vendors, it will record
the discounts--called rebates and allowances--only after it has a
formal agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, Kmart recorded the discounts in anticipation of
receiving them.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart filed for bankruptcy Jan. 22, following disappointing
holiday sales and a stock dive.The restated earnings don't change the
retailer's fiscal year 2001 earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart posted a loss of $2.42 billion, or $4.89 per share, for
2001. The company is to release its 2002 first-quarter earnings
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart closed at 97 cents, down 4 cents, on the NYSE.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of CMS Energy Corp. dropped after a leading credit rating
agency cut the power company's rating, raising the chances of a cash
crunch.</LD>
<LD>   CMS President and Chief Operating Officer David Joos said he was
"frankly disappointed" by Moody's Investors Service's decision, which
adds to the problems of a company whose chief executive resigned last
month amid a power-trading scandal.</LD>
<LD>   The Moody's downgrade, which occurred Tuesday, lowered the rating
on CMS senior unsecured debt from Ba3 to B3, making it a low junk
grade.</LD>
<TE>   Moody's cited CMS' problems "executing an aggressive growth
strategy," as well as weak cash flow and its need to refinance
upcoming debt, including a $450-million line of credit due Monday.</TE>

<HD>Safeway Shares Plunge 12%</HD>
<DH>Retail: Grocery operator, which faces stiff pricing
competition from Wal-Mart, cuts profit forecast for rest of 2002.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHADE ELAM</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Safeway Inc., the nation's third-largest supermarket operator,
lowered profit forecasts for the rest of the year and said it will
close stores and trim prices in an effort to stay competitive,
sending its shares into the biggest decline in at least two decades.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement sparked a sell-off in supermarket sector shares
as investors worried that conventional grocers could struggle into
the second half of the year as a result of an expanding Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., which attracts customers with lower prices on groceries.</LD>
<LD>   Safeway, which owns the Von's and Pavilion chains as well as its
namesake stores, said earnings will be as much as 6 cents a share
less than analysts' 77-cent average estimate for its second quarter
ending Saturday. Profit will be $2.86 to $2.90 a share for the fiscal
year, rather than the $3.15 analysts were expecting, the Pleasanton,
Calif.-based company said.</LD>
<TE>   Chief Executive Steve Burd said on a conference call that he plans
to close as many as 14 stores and reduce prices to compete with
larger rivals Kroger Co. and Albertson's Co., as well as Wal-Mart and
other discounters. Kroger is the owner of Ralphs Grocery Co.</TE>
<TE>   Safeway faces the looming threat of 40 new Wal-Mart super centers
planned for California over the next few years. Albertson's also has
announced plans for a $1-billion expansion in the state, where about
a third of Safeway's stores are located.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to have to defend their markets a little bit to get
sales," said David Yucius, president of Aurora Investment Counsel,
which owns 30,000 Safeway shares. "The bang they're going to get from
cutting costs won't be consistent with what they've done in the past
because of competition."</TE>
<TE>   Safeway shares fell $4.42 to $31.76 in New York Stock Exchange
trading, the lowest close since January 2000. The 12% drop was the
largest since at least 1981.</TE>
<TE>   On the NYSE, Kroger, the largest grocer, fell $1.30, or 6.1%, to
$19.90, and Albertson's dropped $1.51, or 4.7%, to $30.50.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said investors are concerned about narrowing margins as
supermarket chains slash prices to compete with Wal-Mart.</TE>
<TE>   Kroger, which competes with Safeway in about 45% of its locations,
and Albertson's, which competes in about 55%, lowered prices last
year and both gained market share, said Andy Wolf, an analyst for
BB&amp;T Capital Markets. Wolf has a "hold" rating on Safeway and doesn't
own the shares.</TE>
<TE>   Albertson's on Wednesday reiterated its profit forecasts of 53
cents a share for the first quarter and $2.31 for the year. Kroger
said it expects its profit, excluding some costs, to exceed
forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   Safeway may find it difficult to boost profit margins because it
already has the highest in the business, said Deutsche Bank
Securities analyst Charles Lemos.</TE>
<TE>   Safeway, which operates 1,782 stores, also cited disruptions in
its efforts to centralize buying and merchandising in reducing its
profit outlook.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it expects expenses of $60 million to $70 million
in the second quarter to close the stores, mostly in Texas and
Illinois, and fire workers as it centralizes marketing and
restructures a 29-store labor contract.</TE>
<TE>   Capital spending this year will be cut by about 10% to $1.9
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the company may have been too ambitious in its five-
year, same-store sales forecasts of 3% to 4% growth.</TE>
<TE>   Burd said sales at stores open at least a year, excluding new and
closed locations as well as replacement stores, will decline this
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "We will try very hard to make this a one-quarter event," he said.</TE>

<HD>Spanish Broadcasting Suit Alleges Antitrust Actions</HD>
<DH>Media: Clear Channel, Hispanic Broadcasting are accused of
trying to bully the smaller firm out of radio market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spanish Broadcasting System Inc. on Wednesday sued its bigger
rivals--Clear Channel Communications and Hispanic Broadcasting
Corp.--accusing the two Texas companies of antitrust behavior
designed to squeeze it out of the Spanish-language radio market.</LD>
<LD>   Spanish Broadcasting filed its suit in U.S. District Court in
Miami on the same day that Los Angeles-based Univision Communications
Inc. announced that it was buying Hispanic Broadcasting in a
$3.5-billion stock deal. Clear Channel, the nation's largest radio
network, owns 26% of Hispanic Broadcasting. If the deal goes through,
Clear Channel, based in San Antonio, will own 7% of Univision.</LD>
<LD>   The suit filed by Spanish Broadcasting, a Miami-based company with
15 Spanish-language radio stations, includes multiple allegations of
corporate bullying by Clear Channel.</LD>
<TE>   The 20-page lawsuit alleges that, in an attempt to thwart Spanish
Broadcasting's 1999 initial public stock offering, Clear Channel and
Hispanic Broadcasting executives told Lehman Bros. investment bankers
that Spanish Broadcasting Chief Executive Raul Alarcon Jr. was a
"drug user and/or drug trafficker."</TE>
<TE>   Tensions between the two Spanish-language radio companies
heightened after a failed bid by Clear Channel to acquire Spanish
Broadcasting in 1996, the suit says.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel Chief Financial Officer Randall T. Mays allegedly
told Spanish Broadcasting that if it didn't accept Clear Channel's
offer, the company "will ultimately buy [Spanish Broadcasting] on the
Bankruptcy Court steps."</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel also waged bidding wars for stations that Spanish
Broadcasting wanted to buy to inflate the price, the suit contends.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel and Hispanic Broadcasting, based in Dallas, are
accused in the suit of using their clout to pressure other Wall
Street firms to abandon plans to participate in Spanish
Broadcasting's IPO or to provide analyst coverage of the company.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit claimed that in one instance a Clear Channel executive
allegedly threatened investment banking firm Deutsche Bank Alex.
Brown Inc. with the loss of $30 million in fees from Clear Channel
and Hispanic Broadcasting if the firm participated in its rival's
IPO.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel vehemently denied the charges. "Clear Channel
Communications has always operated its businesses--and continues to
operate them--fairly, honestly, legally and with the highest
standards of ethics," the company said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Hispanic Broadcasting, through a spokeswoman, said the firm hadn't
seen the suit but considered the allegations "baseless." Lehman Bros.
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish Broadcasting said it hired attorney David Boies to handle
its antitrust case. Boies represented former Vice President Al Gore
in his challenge of the 2000 presidential election results in
Florida. Boies also worked on behalf of the federal government in its
landmark antitrust case against Microsoft Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish Broadcasting's shares closed at $11.51, down 99 cents, on
Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel's shares closed at $45.89, down $3.91, on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Hispanic Broadcasting's stock closed at $26, up $1.55, also on the
NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Bristol-Myers Exec to Testify in ImClone Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. executive Brian Markison will be asked today
about how he learned four days beforehand that regulators would
reject a cancer drug developed by ImClone Systems Inc.,
Bristol-Myers' partner, said the chairman of the panel holding the
hearing.</LD>
<LD>   The Food and Drug Administration on Dec. 28 rejected ImClone's
application for Erbitux.</LD>
<LD>   Four days earlier, a FDA employee told a Bristol-Myers attorney
Dec. 24 that the agency found the application flawed, said Rep. James
C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee's oversight panel. The attorney passed the information on
to Markison, the company's vice president of oncology, Greenwood
said.</LD>
<TE>   "That may have been inadvertent, but that's what we have to get
to," Greenwood said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of New York-based ImClone have dropped 86% since the FDA's
announcement Dec. 28. The House committee, which oversees the FDA,
announced its investigation of ImClone on Jan. 18.</TE>
<TE>   Laurie Smaldone, Bristol-Myers' senior vice president of worldwide
regulatory affairs, will be the company's primary witness, according
to the witness list released by the committee. Bristol-Myers owns a
20% stake in ImClone and was helping develop Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone Chief Executive Harlan Waksal, brother of former CEO
Samuel Waksal, also will testify before lawmakers today, a panel
spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Five FDA employees, including Richard Pazdur, head of the division
that reviews cancer drugs, and Patricia Keegan, a senior official in
the division that reviews biologic products, will be questioned about
when the agency realized the Erbitux application was inadequate and
what the FDA told the company during the review process.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA workers were subpoenaed by the panel last week.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department
are investigating ImClone's handling of the Erbitux matter.</TE>

<HD>PC Shipment Figures for '01 Revised Upward</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Personal computer makers shipped 8 million more PCs last year than
previously reported, according to revised figures that include a
closer count of small manufacturers, research firm IDC said.
Worldwide shipments were 133.5 million, 6.3% more than the previous
estimate of 125.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   The revision means there is a larger base of PC users than
thought, which will affect estimates for purchases of peripheral
products and services such as printers and Internet access, said
Loren Loverde, director of IDC's Worldwide Quarterly PC Tracker.</LD>
<LD>   The revised figures don't change the fact that PC shipments fell
in 2001 for the first time since 1985. Including the new figures,
worldwide shipments fell 4% instead of the previously estimated 5%.</LD>
<TE>   IDC's revised figures showed that all of the top five vendors lost
market share. Dell Computer Corp. had the biggest change, falling to
12.9% from 13.7%.</TE>
<TE>   The revision didn't change the positions of any of the top five
manufacturers.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Symantec Corp., a maker of software that fends off computer viruses
and hacker attacks, will report first-quarter sales that are at the
upper end of its forecast, Chief Executive John Thompson said.</LD>
<LD>   The computer-security company had forecast sales of $280 million
to $290 million in the quarter ending June 30 and profit, excluding
certain costs, of 32 cents a share. Profit is expected to exceed that
forecast, which was based on sales in the middle of the range,
Thompson said during a presentation at a Bear Stearns Cos. technology
conference in New York.</LD>
<LD>   Symantec, based in Cupertino, Calif., expects sales in its fiscal
year ending in March of $1.22 billion to $1.25 billion, an increase
of as much as 17% from a year earlier.</LD>
<TE>   The company expects earnings for the year to be $1.42 a share,
based on sales at the middle of that range.</TE>
<TE>   Symantec shares rose 81 cents to $31.15 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Online purchases will grab a larger portion of U.S. retail sales this
year as they rise to $72.1 billion, according to a study of Internet
retailing.</LD>
<LD>   Internet buyers will account for almost one-fourth of all computer
and software retail sales this year, while a little more than one of
eight books sold will be purchased on the Web, said a study for
Shop.org, a trade industry group.</LD>
<LD>   A combination of more people shopping on the Internet and
increased repeat purchases will contribute to the increase, the
report said. Internet sales are projected to rise 41% from last
year's $51.3 billion and account for 3.2% of total retail sales of
$2.25 trillion as more women join men to shop online.</LD>
<TE>   The Internet will account for more than 5% of toy, travel, music
and video, event ticket, book and computer purchases this year, the
study said. Internet sales accounted for 2.4% of the $2.16 trillion
in total retail sales last year, Shop.org said.</TE>
<TE>   The study was produced from a survey of more than 100 retailers.</TE>

<HD>Toyota's Baja Plant Underway</HD>
<DH>Autos: Mexican officials hope the factory will bring
investments and thousands of jobs. Rail line to Western U.S. is part
of vision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TIJUANA</DL>
<LD>Ushering in what Mexican officials hope is a new industrial era for
Baja California, President Vicente Fox on Wednesday kicked off
construction of a new Toyota Motor Co. automotive factory that over
time may bring an influx of investments and thousands of jobs to the
state.</LD>
<LD>   Fox also provided new impetus for construction of a proposed rail
line to link Baja with the western U.S. transportation grid. By
transferring operating rights of such a line to the state from the
federal government, Fox hopes to jump-start a $250-million proposal
to make Ensenada a major rail-linked container cargo center.</LD>
<LD>   In remarks at the ceremony, Baja Gov. Eugenio Elorduy announced
that the first of several major Toyota suppliers has committed to
building a parts facility. Officials in the Baja state economic
development secretary's office said an additional three or four
supplier projects are imminent.</LD>
<TE>   Budd Co. of Troy, Mich., will build a metal stamping and forming
plant near the Toyota plant, Elorduy said. Company officials
confirmed plans to build the facility but declined to say how much
the company will invest in it. Budd operates a similar metal stamping
plant in Guanajuato state to supply a huge General Motors Corp. auto
factory.</TE>
<TE>   The groundbreaking comes as the light-assembly manufacturing
plants called maquiladoras continue to lose jobs and the work
migrates to other areas of Latin America and Asia where costs are
lower. Situated in a former olive grove about 20 miles east of
downtown Tijuana, the Toyota factory initially will make parts for
Toyota light trucks. But over time, the factory will be expanded to
make motors and then entire vehicles, Baja officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are days to be celebrated and this is one of them, one that
is bringing technology and new investment that will create jobs and a
new automotive cluster in Baja California," Fox said after he and the
chief executive of Toyota Motor Manufacturing North America, Teruyuki
Minoura, planted a ceremonial tree.</TE>
<TE>   Fox likened the effect of the Toyota factory on Baja California's
economy to that of General Motors and its arrival in the 1980s in
Guanajuato, where he was governor before being elected president in
December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Guanajuato has 60,000 auto jobs and has become one of Mexico's
most prosperous states. Dennis C. Cuneo, vice president of Toyota
Motor Manufacturing North America, said Toyota still had not decided
how much money it will invest in the first phase of factory
construction, nor on how many workers it will employ at first.</TE>
<TE>   "We always start out small and conservative, and if we are
successful, we expand," Cuneo told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota expects the first phase of construction to be complete by
fall 2004, when it will begin sending truck beds to its California
assembly plant. Toyota has 10 factories in North America, four of
which assemble complete vehicles, employing 20,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Tijuana facility is Toyota's first in Mexico. State and
federal officials say the auto maker is considering building a second
plant closer to the center of the country.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota is beginning construction as Baja and Mexican manufacturing
generally still is mired in a slump caused by the U.S. recession and
a strong peso that has made Mexico less competitive on the global
labor market.</TE>
<TE>   Maquiladora jobs nationwide fell to 1.1 million in March, the
latest month for which figures are available. That's a 21% decline
from the jobs peak of 1.3 million in November 2000. In Baja, over the
same period, maquiladora jobs shrank 24% to 218,439.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Romero, head of the Tijuana area association of maquiladora
operators, a trade group, said operating costs have risen as much as
23% in the last 18 months because of new tax and customs laws. Many
Japanese companies have closed production lines or entire plants and
moved operations to China or other lower-cost Asian countries, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In his talk, Fox said, however, that the Mexican manufacturing
sector showed encouraging signs of recovery in April, with output
rising 8% from the previous month.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal officials are hoping that Baja will enter a new
age of heavier industry and "value added" manufacturing. The key
element of the Baja rail proposal is a 65-mile line linking
Ensenada's port with Tecate, where it would link up with a currently
inoperative rail line that connects Baja with the Union Pacific grid
in the Imperial Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Baja state official Jesus Torres Acevedo said the state hopes to
open bidding within six months on construction of the rail line, part
of a plan to increase the prominence of Ensenada's container port and
to promote economic development of an interior strip of Baja
California.</TE>

<HD>Tyco Wins Approval for CIT Public Offering</HD>
<DH>Conglomerates: The SEC's OK comes as Moody's cuts the
company's credit rating to junk status.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tyco International Ltd. won government approval Wednesday for an
initial public offering of its CIT Group Inc. unit, a deal that could
raise as much as $5.8 billion for the cash-strapped company.</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission approval came after Tyco
agreed that CIT would slice the value of goodwill on its books by
$4.5 billion, reducing the value of Tyco's investment. Goodwill is
the difference between what a company paid for an asset and what it
is worth.</LD>
<LD>   The IPO is seen as crucial to Tyco because the Bermuda-based
company needs to pay more than $8 billion in debt through next
February.</LD>
<TE>   Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday cut the company's credit
ratings to "junk," or below-investment-grade status, and Standard &amp;
Poor's said it might follow suit if the CIT deal isn't completed
within two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you sell CIT, the liquidity issues will look a little
better," Mark Demos, an analyst with Fifth Third Investments, told
Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco--whose products range from medical supplies to burglar
alarms--has lost about $100 billion in market value since the
beginning of the year amid investor worries about its debt
obligations and corporate strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco shares fell 90 cents to close at $10.15 on the New York Stock
Exchange before the SEC's announcement, but news of the regulatory
approval pushed up Tyco's stock $2.35, or 29%, to $13.10 in
after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco, which bought CIT for $9.5 billion a year ago, said it will
restate earnings for its second quarter, which ended March 31, and
take a $4.5-billion goodwill charge for the IPO.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco International Group, the unit that sells most of Tyco's debt,
had its credit rating cut to Ba2, or "junk," from Baa3, the lowest
investment grade. The ratings might be cut further, Moody's said.
Tyco International Ltd. is rated Ba1.</TE>
<TE>   The credit rating cut means Tyco could be forced to repay $223
billion of yen-denominated debt because of so-called triggers
contained in lending agreements, Moody's said.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco also is under SEC investigation for alleged misuse of loans
by ousted Chief Executive L. Dennis Kozlowski, who was indicted for
tax evasion last week.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC had held off approving the IPO while it questioned the
finance company's goodwill accounting, sparking concern that the
offering might be delayed beyond Tyco's self-imposed deadline of June
30.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco's interim chief executive, John F. Fort, said Friday that the
SEC delay might push the sale into July.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco spokesman Gary Holmes was not available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco now can send out prospectuses for the offering to investors
and plan for a series of meetings with investors in Europe and the
United States to promote it.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco plans to sell 200 million shares for $25 to $29 each,
according to the company's IPO filing.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc. are managing
the IPO with J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. and eight other banks.</TE>

<HD>Dozens of Firms Object to Speedy Disclosure Plan</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Proposal by SEC aims to get company data to
investors faster. Opponents say time push could lead to errors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coca-Cola Co. and Eastman Kodak Co. are among more than 50 U.S.
companies objecting to a Securities and Exchange Commission plan to
speed companies' financial disclosures as a response to Enron Corp.'s
bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC rule proposal, which is being pushed by Chairman Harvey L.
Pitt, would give investors faster access to quarterly and annual
earnings reports of company finances. The plan supplements a separate
SEC proposal, issued Wednesday for public comment, that would give
companies two days to report developments on contracts, executive
changes and stock market delistings.</LD>
<LD>   At least 50 companies in the Fortune 500 and the four biggest U.S.
accounting firms have urged the SEC to drop or scale back the
quarterly report proposal. The corporations say the pressures from
tighter deadlines would lead to erroneous and incomplete reports at a
time when the SEC is pushing for fuller, more accurate disclosure.</LD>
<TE>   "The corporations have very valid concerns, and I think the SEC
will give great weight to their comments," said David B. Martin, a
Washington lawyer who headed the SEC's corporation-finance unit from
January 2000 to January 2002. "But while the SEC may compromise on
the deadlines or the timing, I'd be surprised if they drop the
proposal."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal, issued for public comment in April, would require
quarterly reports to be filed within 30 days of the end of the
quarter, rather than 45 days. Annual reports would have to be made
within 60 days of the end of the fiscal year, not the current 90.</TE>
<TE>   Facing pressure from Congress and investors, Pitt has advocated
fuller and faster disclosures to protect stockholders from the kind
of accounting failures that led Enron to file for bankruptcy
protection Dec. 2. The SEC also has opened dozens of accounting
investigations in recent months, including probes of Global Crossing
Ltd., WorldCom Inc. and Dynegy Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The Council of Institutional Investors, which represents pension
funds overseeing $1 trillion in assets, supports the SEC's plan.</TE>
<TE>   "It is vitally important for council members to have timely access
to clear and transparent financial information about portfolio
companies," the group said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC on Wednesday proposed making firms disclose sooner when
they've taken on new financial obligations or made executive changes.</TE>
<TE>   The plan, which was issued for public comment for 60 days, would
shorten to two days the deadline for filing disclosure forms on these
and other events. The deadline now is five to 15 days.</TE>
<TE>   More Newsletter Editors Are Becoming Bearish</TE>
<TE>   Pessimism about U.S. stocks among investment newsletter editors
rose last week to its highest since Sept. 28, according to a poll by
Investors Intelligence newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   The portion of editors considering themselves bearish, or
pessimistic, climbed to 34.7% from 31.3% the week before. Bearishness
reached a three-year high of 42.7% on Sept. 28, the second week of
trading after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The portion of editors considering themselves bullish, or
optimistic, declined to 42.9%, the lowest since Nov. 2. Bullishness
was 48.9% a week earlier and hit a four-year low of 33.7% after the
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Technical analysts, who try to predict stock moves based on price
patterns and other statistical measures, see a peak in pessimism and
a low in optimism as a "contrarian" sign that stocks may be poised to
gain.</TE>
<TE>   When the majority of investors are bearish, they already may have
pulled most of their funds from the market.</TE>
<TE>   Bethlehem Steel Gets New Ticker Symbol</TE>
<TE>   Bethlehem Steel Corp., the third-biggest U.S. steelmaker, started
to trade over the counter Wednesday with a new ticker symbol after
its shares were delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The new ticker symbol is BHMS, changed from BS on the NYSE. The
Bethlehem, Pa.-based company's shares were removed from the exchange
because they had traded for less than $1 for 30 consecutive days.</TE>
<TE>   Bethlehem Steel filed for bankruptcy protection in October. Last
year, it had a net loss of $1.95 billion on $3.33 billion in sales
because of low steel demand and competition from imports.</TE>
<TE>   The firm's shares Wednesday rose 5 cents to close at 30 cents.</TE>

<HD>When Skies Aren't So Friendly, Arm the Pilots</HD>
<DH>Fortified doors aren't enough.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CONRAD BURNS</AU>
<BD>Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) is a member of the Senate
Commerce Committee and the aviation subcommittee.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've never met a door that couldn't be opened or a pilot who's ever
seen an air marshal. So I was perplexed and disappointed when the
undersecretary of Transportation for security testified before the
Senate Commerce Committee that the pilots we entrust daily with
multimillion-dollar machines and thousands of lives aren't to be
trusted with side arms. He puts his faith in "fortified doors," a
seemingly nonexistent army of air marshals and--if all else
fails--in-flight maneuvers to throw terrorists off guard. Instead, he
should be thinking like the kamikaze terrorists that these pilots
could face.</LD>
<LD>   When I was in the Marines I learned that to defeat the enemy, you
must think like the enemy. For this reason, I believe the Justice
Department is better prepared to handle aviation security than
Federal Aviation Administration bureaucrats. Do they really think a
door--not a 9-millimeter gun--is a sufficient deterrent to future
Mohamed Attas?</LD>
<LD>   If people want to die hijacking planes, it makes sense to this old
cowboy that they die before they get the job done.</LD>
<TE>   That's why I am co-authoring a bill to create a voluntary program
to arm pilots and establish a training program for flight attendants.
Deadly force is the only language of deterrence a terrorist
understands. Without it, we're vesting our faith in the chimera of
air marshals and spotty airport security. A secure commercial flight
relies on preventive layers of security being 100% effective, 100% of
the time. We're foolish to expect that equation to work perfectly,
forever, just as we're foolish to believe in an impregnable door. A
fortified door is not fortified when the door is opened, as it must
be when attendants bring pilots their meals. Rather than allow pilots
to protect themselves, their aircraft and passengers with guns,
should the government mandate that pilots abstain from eating?</TE>
<TE>   Once airborne, flights are virtually defenseless. There are only
1,000 air marshals--who at the very least work in pairs--to service
more than 30,000 flights a day in the U.S. To build up a force
sufficient to staff every flight we'd need to create something nearly
the size of the Marine Corps.</TE>
<TE>   This is no time to be gunshy about terrorism. We give our soldiers
guns and send them to Afghanistan. We are prepared to give air
marshals guns and put them in the flight cabin. But we're prepared to
let pilots, almost two-thirds of whom have served in the military,
fend for the plane and passengers with their bare hands. Or arm them
with stun guns.</TE>
<TE>   American soldiers aren't asked to fight terrorists with toys and
temerity. Let's give trained men and women the right to self-defense.
And let's do that by using frangible ammunition, which disintegrates
upon impact with a metal surface but is strong enough to take down a
terrorist. That's how the terror will end, how the hijackings can
end. Not with a whimper but a bang.</TE>

<HD>Fuzzy Geography of the Mideast</HD>
<DH>What is the West Bank? The varying answers trip up the
peace process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRIDA GHITIS</AU>
<BD>Frida Ghitis' latest book is "The End of Revolution: A
Changing World in the Age of Live Television" (Algora Publishing,
2001).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A few years ago while on assignment in Amman, Jordan, I was chatting
with one of the friendly waiters at my hotel, who told me he was
Palestinian. His father, he explained, had come to Jordan from the
West Bank.</LD>
<LD>   Where in the West Bank, I asked.</LD>
<LD>   "Jaffa," he said, naming the old town by the sea next to Tel Aviv.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought you said the West Bank," I responded naively. Like most
people, I thought the West Bank was the narrow strip of land to the
west of the Jordan River occupied by Israel in 1967. He quickly
dispelled my misconception.</TE>
<TE>   "The West Bank," he explained, "goes from the river Jordan all the
way to the sea."</TE>
<TE>   His West Bank included all of Israel. Apparently my waiter
friend's ideas match the views of most Palestinians today, who,
according to a recent survey by a Palestinian polling group, say the
objective of the current uprising is not to end the Israeli
occupation of territories captured in 1967, but rather to "liberate
all of historic Palestine."</TE>
<TE>   That term in itself--historic Palestine--is hardly an example of
specificity, since there has never been a country called Palestine.
After World War I, with the Ottoman Empire defeated, the British
received a mandate to look after the region named Palestine by the
Roman Empire. The Turkish Ottomans had controlled the area for
centuries before the British took over. More than half of that land
of the Palestinian Mandate became an independent Jordan in 1946. Two
years later, in 1948, the United Nations divided the rest between
Arabs and Jews in a partition rejected by the Arabs, who immediately
went to war against Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The territory most non-Arabs consider under dispute today--the
West Bank and Gaza--was captured by Israel from Jordan and Egypt,
respectively, during the 1967 Six-Day War.</TE>
<TE>   Presumably those responding to this month's poll by the
Palestinian Jerusalem Media and Communication Centre did not mean
they want to take over Jordan, too, when they spoke of "all of
historic Palestine." What they want is all of Israel, in addition to
the 1967 lands.</TE>
<TE>   This fuzzy geography, a game of deliberate double-meanings and
frequent misunderstandings, is what made it possible for Israel and
the Palestinians during the years of the Oslo accords to move
confidently forward without making any real progress. Discussions
about returning the West Bank sounded good to both sides, when in
reality each party's definition was completely unacceptable to the
other. Israelis consistently tell pollsters that they support the
creation of a Palestinian state in most of the occupied territories,
and almost half of the Palestinians polled do support a vision of a
state along similar lines to what most Israelis envision.</TE>
<TE>   But the people controlling the fate of the Palestinians today have
no desire to compromise. Entities like Hamas and Islamic Jihad don't
even pretend to merely seek an end to the occupation. They openly
call for an end to Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's real motives are harder to discern. Former Prime Minister
Ehud Barak once believed Arafat indeed wanted a two-state solution.
The current Israeli leader, Ariel Sharon, has never believed in
Arafat's trustworthiness.</TE>
<TE>   On both sides the moderates have lost ground since the peace
process collapsed at the end of the Clinton and Barak
administrations.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian poll showed that, even though most believe Arafat
will win the next election, only 25% say they trust him more than any
other politician. Palestinians have never had a leader willing to
talk peace with Israel while preparing their people for
compromise--for a state whose borders will not reach all the way to
Tel Aviv and will not include all of Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   On both sides there are many who want peace. For now, however,
those whose definition of the West Bank includes all of Israel are
calling the shots on the Palestinian side. This puts Israel's cards
in the hands of people who believe Palestinians will always want to
destroy their country.</TE>

<HD>Tyco Chief's Art of Putting Himself First</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIANNA HUFFINGTON</AU>
<BD>Arianna Huffington is a syndicated columnist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Why?</LD>
<LD>   That's the question on everyone's lips in the wake of the
indictment of Tyco's former superstar chief executive, L. Dennis
Kozlowski, on charges of evading $1 million in sales taxes on
paintings he bought. Why would a man who earned $125 million last
year and owns planes, yachts and multimillion-dollar homes risk it
all to save a million bucks--probably about what he spends each year
to keep his fleet of Harley-Davidson motorcycles running?</LD>
<LD>   After immersing myself in Kozlowski's business history, I have a
different question: Why is anyone surprised? The alleged behavior
that has him facing prison is exactly the behavior that was the
hallmark of his run as Tyco's swashbuckling, take-no-prisoners CEO.</LD>
<TE>   Why is it, then, so shocking to learn that Kozlowski is now
accused of being a small-time con artist to avoid paying taxes on
$13.2 million worth of paintings wryly described by the New York
Times as "second-tier work by big-name artists"? This, after all, is
the same guy who, in 1997, moved his company's nominal headquarters
to Bermuda to--you got it--avoid paying taxes on billions in overseas
earnings. Apparently, life imitates business when it comes to the art
of cutting corners.</TE>
<TE>   According to the less-than-flattering portrait painted by
prosecutors, Kozlowski bought the high-end paintings--which included
a Monet and a Renoir--for his $18-million apartment on Fifth Avenue,
but had them routed through Tyco's offices in New Hampshire so he
wouldn't have to pay New York City's 8.25% sales tax. In one case,
the cooperative art dealers allegedly sent them directly to
Kozlowski's apartment while shipping empty crates to New Hampshire.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to this murky moral landscape, it turns out that Kozlowski
funded some art purchases with no-interest loans drawn from a Tyco
program designed to help employees buy company stock. Perhaps if he
had made do with a few LeRoy Neiman sports scenes and that perennial
classic, "Dogs Playing Poker," he could have avoided downsizing
employees and raiding their stock fund.</TE>
<TE>   It was maneuvers like these that, until his fall from grace, had
earned Kozlowski the admiration of Wall Street and a reputation as
America's "most aggressive CEO"--the title of a 2001 cover story in
Business Week. The magazine went so far as to laud Kozlowski, an
accountant by trade, for his "willingness to test the limits of
acceptable accounting and tax strategies." It took the Enron collapse
for Wall Street to stop applauding and start asking questions. The
disturbing answers caused stock in Tyco--a conglomerate whose
products include electronic parts, telecom systems, medical equipment
and burglar alarms--to lose three-quarters of its value this year,
costing investors $95 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere along the way, Kozlowski, the son of a New Jersey cop,
began to see himself and the company he led as one and the same. Like
so many other CEOs grabbing today's headlines, Kozlowski adopted the
outlook of France's Louis XIV, who notoriously proclaimed: "L'etat,
c'est moi"--"I am the state."</TE>
<TE>   If King Louis was Kozlowski's historical ancestor, convicted felon
Leona Helmsley--who once declared that only the little people pay
taxes--was his spiritual godmother. Dennis the Public Menace's
progress from tax aversion to tax evasion began with his
loophole-exploiting business practices and ended with his defrauding
the public out of tax money.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, prosecutors breathing down his neck, Kozlowski gave
the commencement address at New Hampshire's St. Anselm College. Freud
would have had a field day with his message to the Class of 2002.
"You will be confronted," he warned them, "with questions every day
that test your morals. Think carefully, and for your sake, do the
right thing, not the easy thing." You could almost see Kozlowski's
superego and id duking it out under his mortarboard.</TE>
<TE>   We've spawned a corporate culture that has made demigods out of
those doing the easy thing. Turning it around will take more than
noble commencement speeches. It will take throwing a few of those
demigods in jail. I can picture it now: "Still Life In Prison
Stripes."</TE>

<BD>Karen Kornbluh, a fellow at the New America Foundation,
was deputy chief of staff of the Treasury Department and worked in
the Federal Communications Commission during the Clinton
administration.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has largely ignored the nation's $700-billion
telecommunications industry's free fall, a costly mistake for the
U.S. economy. Stock prices are down 75%, and telecom companies are
expected to reduce their capital spending for the second year in a
row.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush should use today's White House high-tech industry
forum to announce a national broadband strategy.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. broadband usage--the number of households that use high-speed
Internet connections--is stalled at less than 10%. This delays the
productivity-enhancing new applications that require faster
connections and puts us well behind South Korea, where more than 50%
of households use broadband.</LD>
<TE>   The administration has yet to develop a broadband strategy and has
slowly unraveled rules granting entrepreneurs access to the network.
A House-passed bill would do more of the same. Democratic
congressional leaders and some Republicans are calling for universal
broadband; Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) has asked the president
to submit a plan to Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government took a leading role in such
productivity-enhancing infrastructure technologies as canals,
railroads, highways, electricity and telephone service. Now it should
create the conditions for the private sector to innovate and invest
in this new highway. Here's how:</TE>
<TE>   * Bush can create a more favorable investment climate by
announcing a national goal--much as President Kennedy focused on
getting a man to the moon--of universal, affordable broadband access
by 2005 and extra-high-speed access by 2010. He should restore the
government's commitment to competition and regulatory certainty by
announcing his administration will enforce rather than dismantle
current rules. Bush also should announce that he will bring together
the various industries to resolve issues such as how to handle
intellectual property to benefit consumers--and warn that the
government will step in if they can't solve the problems on their
own.</TE>
<TE>   * State and local governments should be required to get out of the
habit of protecting existing businesses by imposing fees and permits
on newcomers. Michigan Gov. John Engler took the lead in overriding
anti-competitive local measures. Federal standards must move quickly
to sweep away such rules around the country.</TE>
<TE>   * Regulators need to free the spectrum. During the last decade,
investment in wireless skyrocketed and prices declined as competition
thrived. This happened because in the mid-1990s, the Clinton-Gore
administration auctioned off parts of the spectrum that established
companies were warehousing to competitors eager to invest in new
services.</TE>
<TE>   Today, entrepreneurs have found new ways to provide wireless,
broadband connections at minimal cost by sharing airwaves--but no
spectrum is available for their new services. Broadcasters hold, for
free, twice as much spectrum as they need because the transition to
digital television is stalled. The president must insist on a hard
deadline for the broadcasters to go digital. A chunk of the freed
spectrum should be set aside for the new shared technology and the
rest auctioned off to new entrants.</TE>
<TE>   * The Bush administration should lead by example. Think of the
difference that could have been made a year ago by an automated
system that used artificial intelligence to follow up on FBI agents'
hunches by checking flight school rosters. Intel Chairman Andy Grove
once said that there are two kinds of companies: those that use
e-mail and those that will. Government needs to move from the second
category to the first. The sooner it starts using information
technology in innovative ways, the sooner spillover benefits will
begin.</TE>
<TE>   * Government should issue high-tech vouchers. Today's system is
anything but market-based; regulatory artifacts of the old Ma Bell
system of big monopoly-big bureaucracy distort prices and hinder
broad access. Far better would be a pro-competition broadband voucher
for low-income users or those in sparsely populated regions of the
country.</TE>

<HD>Has the Cardinal Learned?</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the meeting of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops that begins
today in Dallas, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony is expected to push for the
approval of a "zero-tolerance" policy against child sexual abuse by
priests. Mahony has put forth a lot of tough talk about zero
tolerance. Before he can persuade his fellow bishops to make needed
changes, he must first get his own archdiocesan house in order and
make sure that actions match words.</LD>
<LD>   Mahony can do that by ensuring that civil authorities are promptly
notified of any and all cases of alleged sexual abuse of minors by
priests in the archdiocese. This is what Mahony has said he stands
for, by voice and in writing. Yet, the actions of the archdiocese
often belie his words.</LD>
<LD>   Just last week, the Los Angeles Police Department complained that
it wasn't notified of an instance in which a priest was removed from
ministry after allegations that he engaged in inappropriate conduct
with a minor 28 years ago. Directly contradicting the policy stated
by the cardinal, the archdiocese's spokesman, Tod Tamberg, said the
church would first conduct an internal investigation to determine
whether the accusations were credible. That's the job of the police.</LD>
<TE>   If the archdiocese was counting on Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley to
fail to act on his threat to go to the grand jury to shake loose
information on abusive priests, it got a shock Wednesday. The grand
jury issued subpoenas to the archdiocese for documents on three
priests accused of child sexual abuse. Mahony said the archdiocese
would comply with the subpoenas. That's a start, but Cooley must take
the search for the facts all the way.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony is one of several bishops who have been hit with
justifiable criticism for the past transfer of priests after being
informed that they sexually abused minors. He says he has learned
from new research and greater awareness of the problem of pedophilia
within the clerical ranks.</TE>
<TE>   Let the lessons learned now be demonstrated. From the beginning of
this scandal, the church deeply wounded its credibility, telling the
faithful to do as it says, not as it does. The meeting in Dallas is
an important opportunity for Mahony and other bishops to put
consistent action behind all of the soothing words.</TE>
<TE>   Forgiveness is certainly appropriate within a religious context.
But sexual abuse of a child is a crime that demands criminal
penalties--the first time and every time.</TE>

<HD>Cleanup Time for Ralphs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years ago, four local grocery chains, prodded by the state
attorney general and environmentalists, signed landmark agreements to
convert some of their belching trucks from diesel fuel to
cleaner-burning natural gas. Three grocery companies have made good
on their commitment or are working on it. Only Ralphs has balked. It
owes better to the millions of families who shop in its stores.</LD>
<LD>   Diesel exhaust has been linked to higher rates of cancer,
respiratory problems and other ailments. Children who live near the
companies' warehouses have found their asthma exacerbated by fumes
from the hundreds of diesel trucks that go in and out daily.</LD>
<LD>   As part of the 2000 pacts, the Vons, Albertson's, Stater Bros. and
Ralphs grocery chains agreed to convert to natural-gas engines in all
of the smaller trucks known as "yard goats" that workers use to move
loads around inside their distribution centers. Each company,
including Ralphs, has now done that.</LD>
<TE>   The big-rig trucks that haul merchandise between warehouse and
store also were part of the agreements. State funding helps defray
the $30,000 to convert each truck. Vons has converted 60 new trucks
to natural gas; Albertson's and Stater Bros. are on track to convert
25 and 35 trucks, respectively. Ralphs hasn't retooled any of the 25
rigs it promised it would, balking in part because natural gas prices
soared after the deal was struck. But gas prices are down again.</TE>
<TE>   Ralphs also said the natural-gas switch became too costly after
the state Air Resources Board denied its request for conversion
funds. But Ralphs wanted to convert older trucks, some with 100,000
miles on them, and the air board says it only grants money to convert
new truck engines. Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer and the Natural Resources
Defense Council charge that Ralphs knew its application would be
rejected. Ralphs says the 2000 agreements permitted it to convert
older trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Ralphs' foot-dragging led Lockyer and the NRDC to ask a Los
Angeles judge for a contempt citation against the store. Last week,
the judge rejected their request, but that shouldn't be the end of
the story.</TE>
<TE>   Natural-gas vehicles are becoming a key part of commercial and
government fleets. Almost half of all transit buses nationally now
run on natural gas, as well as many trash trucks. They pollute less
and run well.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Vons, Albertson's and Stater Bros. bargained in
good faith. And after Ralphs agreed to the conversion deal, it bought
several new diesel trucks for which it probably would have received
state funds to switch to natural gas if it had applied. Ralphs should
do what it promised.</TE>

<LD>Awe-full, awesome creatures are these huge fires raging through
woodlands of Southern California and the West as warming summer
weather works its way inexorably north across unusually dry brush and
forests. Most Americans witness these blazes as dramatic images of
dirty white smoke, yellow flames and orange fire retardant spewing
from the bellies of fire-bombing planes. Impressive enough. But up
close, where brave humans turn their sooty faces toward the crackling
heat, these fires are noisy monsters, each with its own peculiar
personality that follows the whim of the winds and the availability
of fuel--brush, trees, gardens and the nice houses that increasingly
crowd wild-land fringes.</LD>
<LD>   Ahead of the flames come the stuffy scent of smoldering wood and
the sight of residents grabbing pets and heirlooms in flight from
destruction of what they always thought was their one safe place. Off
to the side, where helicopters constantly whop-whop in and out, are
camps where professional fire managers, who practiced all winter,
study terrain maps, satellite and aerial photos, weather data and
computer fire models. Sensors across the West even note every
lightning strike. It's a battle zone of tents with troops grabbing
sleep anywhere, radios crackling codes and coordinates, managers
running massive field kitchens, truck and bus routes, phone and water
systems.</LD>
<TE>   At times, as in Colorado, the strategy is to get out of the way,
so fast do wind-whipped flames hop for miles across treetops. At
other times, bulldozers and firefighters try to hem flames in,
narrowing the front. At night, when humidity rises, fires typically
lie down. Fighters pounce with picks, shovels and backfires. By
midmorning, like a sleeper rising to the heat, the fires surge. They
suck in air from behind to blast hot out front to preheat fuel.
Flames do not creep along the ground. One tree, then another and
another bursts into flame, a sizzling torch from top to bottom.</TE>
<TE>   At times, orange and bluish flames 100 feet tall whirl about in
fiery tornadoes that wobble weirdly across mountainsides, hurling
blazing branches like catapults. So intense is this heat, shooting up
thousands of feet, that these fires can evaporate rain showers in
mid-plummet.</TE>
<TE>   The fire sound is strange, a steady, ominous roar like an immense
furnace with the door blown open. This loud rumble ricochets off
hills until its eerie echo, like its smoke, seems to come from
everywhere. It's a diligent firefighter who resists distraction.</TE>
<TE>   Often overlooked in the public pandemonium is fire's natural
cleanup role, igniting another life cycle. Most fires hopscotch
through forests, leaving at least patches of trees and brush to
reseed adjacent burned areas.</TE>
<TE>   This summer's ashes will feed grasses and wildflowers next spring,
if the rains come. And after generations of waiting, lodgepole pine
cones, whose natural tar is melted only by a fire's heat, will have
popped open minutes after the flames passed, automatically planting
seeds of trees that love sun--to make, in a generation or two, shade
for the next species of trees that don't.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Even Tougher Love for Welfare Moms," Commentary, June 11: Because
welfare mothers have made chronically poor decisions in their lives
(children out of wedlock, multiple children, teenagers having
children, lack of education, drug usage), American taxpayers--who are
already taxed to the hilt--will be expected to continually reward
these poor decisions. UC Berkeley professor Bruce Fuller calls the
Bush welfare initiative "radical" and states, "the president's plan
would alter childhood as we know it."</LD>
<LD>   Professor, would it be the president's plan or the mother's lack
of planning that would alter childhood? It's also curious how the
left continually champions the push for more child care and the
merits of it, yet the professor calls 40 hours of child care
"grueling." Which is it? How does the professor balance "advancing
women's work opportunities while strengthening their parenting role"?
In real life, you can't have both, one will always be shortchanged
... unless one lives in the utopian academic world of the professor.
Because of ridiculously high tax rates, most couples and single
mothers not on welfare have grueling workweeks in excess of 40 hours
and send their children to child care ... all without state-sponsored
socialism.</LD>

<TE>   Thank you, Dennis Clausen, for your courage in setting aside the
humiliation and loss of pride that you felt and sharing the story of
your family's dependence on welfare ("The Kindness of Strangers,"
Commentary, June 9). There are millions of "Clausen children" in this
country who accepted the public's assistance in times of financial
need and who have more than repaid that support through subsequent
contributions to the nation's economy as workers and taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   We have heard too much about the failures of our broken welfare
system and not enough from adults who owe their current well-being to
the welfare assistance they received as children. Intimidated by the
stigma of welfare dependency, they have left the field to criticism
by the least-informed and most mean-spirited among us. I hope that
Clausen's example will offer courage to others to come forward and
tell their stories.</TE>

<LD>Re "High Court Backs Forced Confessions," June 11: After reading
about this 5th Amendment decision I was struck by some parallels
between our Supreme Court justices and our Catholic bishops. Both
have been given lifetime appointments without accountability. Both
inhabit "ivory towers" of legalistic theory. Both use their semantic
skills to arrive at conclusions that defy logic. Both explain why it
is right for them to have done wrong rather than admit their
mistakes. And both are out of touch with the people they purport to
serve.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Arafat, by Feeding on Martyrdom, Dooms His People," Commentary,
June 11: Robert Scheer is naive to suggest that "Yasser Arafat should
step aside." Why should he resign? The wily Palestinian Authority
president is winning the war in the Middle East. As the hatchet man
for Saudi, Syrian and Iraqi opponents to the existence of Israel,
Arafat is indispensable; as the negotiator who flatly rejected Ehud
Barak's unprecedented concessions, he is indefatigable; and as the
survivor of Israel's repeated military encirclements of his
headquarters, he has also proved to be irrepressible.</LD>
<LD>   Israel should seize the moment: Before he orders the next attack
on innocent Israeli citizens, capture Arafat and put him on trial.
Surely a methodical presentation of evidence of his murderous
reign--including transcripts of his incendiary speeches in Arabic,
documentation of arms shipments and financial records of rewards paid
for killings--would convince a civilized world that he is guilty of
crimes against humanity.</LD>

<TE>   Scheer proposes that the Palestinians "stand in front of tanks
with prayer books and flowers instead of sacrificing their young."
And, yes, it is absurd, but it is the only thing they haven't tried.
And they are only a step away from being shoveled into their own
graves.</TE>
<TE>   What we have are three leaders (President Bush, Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon and Arafat) who are incapable of achieving peace. It's
time for a change, for the following reasons: Bush, who has an
unashamed, blatant bias for Sharon, which will lead to more terrorist
attacks and may bury us in the end; Sharon, who will fight to the
last Palestinian, even if it kills many more Israelis and will solve
nothing; and Arafat, who has lost favor with everyone.</TE>
<TE>   It's time for the good citizens of each of these countries to
speak up and spell out for their leaders whom they want to represent
them in solving this 54-year-old problem. I vote for Secretary of
State Colin Powell. Anybody else in?</TE>

<LD>Re "Detention of a Citizen Questioned," June 12: How we deal with
terrorism is going to determine what kind of a country we're going to
have. Arresting American citizens on suspicion of plotting to commit
terrorist actions and holding them without charging them or allowing
them legal representation smacks of a police state, no matter what
justification we use.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, we need to protect ourselves, but at what cost? If we have
evidence against terrorists, let them be charged, tried and given the
maximum sentence under the law. To simply hold them and try to
extract information from them smacks of something I am reluctant to
describe.</LD>

<TE>   I am having a hard time climbing aboard any effort to free Jose
Padilla, the "dirty"-bomb suspect, even though I agree in principle
that traditional rules such as habeas corpus would ordinarily apply.</TE>
<TE>   I simply don't want this guy out on bail, running around trying to
take down our major financial and/or government institutions by
contaminating them with a radioactive bomb. If freed, why wouldn't he
attempt to complete his goal, and why should we take that risk?</TE>
<TE>   The way I see it, the U.S. either evolves quickly to deal with
terrorists or it dies. Our traditional legal protections were set up
for traditional criminals. Terrorists are different, in that their
goal is not personal enrichment or revenge against a specific
individual or two. They want to destroy or destabilize our entire
system. Look at 9/11. Not only were thousands of people killed, our
whole economy took a very strong hit from which it has yet to
recover. I only hope the Supreme Court, if the Padilla case gets that
far, sides with the Bush administration and finds a way to keep
terrorists locked up.</TE>

<TE>   When the USA Patriot Act was rushed through Congress, we were
assured that it would never be used against American citizens. I
deplore the intentions of Padilla (Abdullah al Muhajir) to detonate a
dirty bomb, but I find it more frightening that he has been arrested
and can be held indefinitely as an enemy combatant without being
charged.</TE>
<TE>   The brilliance of the Constitution is how it protects even the
rights of terrorists. To take away Padilla's constitutional rights
threatens us all. Timothy McVeigh killed scores of Americans but was
given a fair trial. We should demand the same for Padilla.</TE>

<TE>   It has been nine months since Sept. 11, and after reading the main
articles on the front page on June 11, I do not feel any more secure
and have a bad feeling about what could happen in the future. Al
Qaeda has demonstrated that it still has the intelligence and the
will to plot and execute terrorist plans. President Bush smoked them
out of their holes and got them running, but can he bring them to
justice?</TE>

<TE>   I am tired of watching the political cat and mouse game that the
Bush administration continues to play with the American people and
the Congress. Why is it that the arrest of Padilla is just coming to
light now? If he was arrested in May and the plot to use a
radioactive bomb was uncovered then, why are we just hearing about it
now? Is it only to help the FBI and CIA out of the dirty little mess
they find themselves in now? It doesn't make sense to waste money on
setting up a satellite link to have Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft tell us
from Moscow that they arrested someone back in May.</TE>
<TE>   Sorry, but I will not be quieted. I am tired of the erosion of the
Bill of Rights.</TE>

would please shut up. It certainly would not have helped in this
situation. Or are we now going to profile Latinos and Hispanics as
potential terrorists?</TE>

<LD>I agree with Douglas Cavanaugh's June 9 letter that prison is for
punishment, not rehabilitation. I also believe that once a jury
decides the guilt of a defendant and the judge pronounces sentence,
that sentence should stand. Therefore, California does not need a
parole board. Let's have an initiative to change the law to eliminate
parole for any prisoner. That would be another step to help reduce
crime in our state.</LD>

<HD>Don't Brand Ranching Families as Obsolete</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Ranchers Feeling the Heat" (June 8), about animal-rights activists
and restaurant and grocery chains urging ranchers in the U.S. to stop
the practice of branding their cattle because it is cruel to the
cows, misses the obvious. These are beef cattle; their ultimate
destination is dinner plates across America. Are restaurants and
grocery stores going to eventually stop selling beef altogether?</LD>
<LD>   Are the milking machines next? Will it be "humiliating" to the
cows if we milk them? If you follow the logic of animal-rights
activists, is their next step to eliminate beef and dairy products
altogether? Of course, they do not provide solutions to the economics
of their assertions. It is more important that, as a country, we work
to preserve and protect the industries and practices that built this
country into the great nation it is today.</LD>
<LD>   Many of these ranch families have been working the land of this
country longer than a lot of us have been here. This is a part of our
culture. The stories about how branding day is a day to celebrate
accomplishments, bring neighbors of all ages together, enjoy the
outdoors and bring the family together underscore the importance of
preserving something that has been done for generations.</LD>

<TE>   I am having a problem with the fact that these ranchers associate
good fun with wrestling a newborn calf to the ground and burning its
skin with the branding iron. Not abuse? Try doing that with someone's
dog or child, and see where you end up--probably in jail.</TE>

10,000 prison beds into desks for students in our overcrowded,
underfunded public schools. While the California Department of

<HD>Attias Convicted of Killing 4</HD>
<DH>Court: Jury finds the student murdered the pedestrians at
UC Santa Barbara when he ran them down. Trial's sanity phase is next.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>A jury Wednesday found David Attias guilty of murder in the auto
rampage deaths of four people last year, a case that focused
attention on the heavy partying lifestyle in the college community of
Isla Vista.</LD>
<LD>   The tousled Attias, looking even younger than his 20 years,
glanced back at his parents after the verdicts were read, but
otherwise showed little emotion. He has been under heavy medication
since his arrest immediately after the incident on Feb. 23, 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The four second-degree murder verdicts were the worst possible
outcome for Attias in this phase of the two-pronged trial, exposing
him to a possible life sentence in prison.</LD>
<TE>   The second phase, which will begin today, will determine whether
he was sane when he drove his turbocharged Saab into five pedestrians
16 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we're all disappointed," said defense attorney Jack
Earley, addressing reporters outside the second-floor courtroom of
Judge Thomas Adams. "Now we have to put on the next phase."</TE>
<TE>   The defense has argued that Attias, who has a record of emotional
problems dating to infancy, suffered a psychotic break the night of
the accident.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor, Patrick McKinley, claimed that though Attias is
clearly mentally ill, he knew what he was doing when he sped along
streets crowded with weekend partygoers. Witnesses described Attias
leaping out of his car and fighting onlookers, shouting "I am the
angel of death!"</TE>
<TE>   The jury deliberated almost six days before rejecting a possible
manslaughter verdict and choosing murder. Though Attias showed little
reaction, his father, television director Daniel Attias, slumped
forward slightly and put his arm around his wife. Afterward, the
parents slipped out of the courthouse without speaking to anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Earley said he hadn't had a chance to talk to his client after the
verdicts were read. His client's numb expression might not be a
result of the medication, he said. Earley said some people are too
stunned in the immediate aftermath of a guilty verdict to react.</TE>
<TE>   Acting With Malice</TE>
<TE>   In choosing murder, the jury decided that Attias acted with
malice, which would seemingly make it more likely that they will find
him sane.</TE>
<TE>   But Earley denied that, saying he remains hopeful that the jury
will find that his client was so mentally damaged that he could not
possibly meet the test of sanity: that he understood the nature and
quality of what he was doing and could appreciate the difference
between right and wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Earley called a parade of psychologists and psychiatrists to
testify about Attias' manifold mental and emotional problems, which
began when he bit himself and pounded his head against walls as a
small child. Many of those witnesses will return to the stand for the
sanity phase.</TE>
<TE>   From his early years, Attias had problems making friends. He
developed a deep rage that at 13 caused him to be hospitalized for
attempting to strangle his younger sister, Rachel. Over time, he was
diagnosed with everything from attention deficit to bipolar to
obsessive compulsive disorder and even budding schizophrenia as
therapists struggled to gain an understanding of what was misfiring
in Attias' brain.</TE>
<TE>   According to testimony, David Attias single-handedly turned his
household in Santa Monica into an emotional war zone. His father said
he tried to intervene with David as he was growing up. But the elder
Attias said he was absent a lot while building his career. He is a
well-known director of episodic television, having worked on "The
Sopranos," "Ally McBeal" and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer."</TE>
<TE>   Difficulty Coping</TE>
<TE>   Diana Attias was often left on her own trying to cope with her
son, and she made it clear during her day on the witness stand that
she was not up to it. Eventually, David's problems strained the
marriage. "I love my wife," said Daniel Attias. But her tendency to
withdraw "did make me very frustrated."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the parents didn't realize how serious their son's
problems were. Daniel Attias said he was pleased that his son managed
to gain admission to UC Santa Barbara, and he pushed him to stay
there even after his son asked to withdraw to attend a community
college.</TE>
<TE>   David's mental problems escalated at the college's Francisco
Torres Residence Hall, where he substituted marijuana and cocaine for
the medication he was supposed to take to control his behavior,
according to testimony. He had two auto accidents, yet he was given a
new car, something his father later regretted. "While I was concerned
about his driving, I was not alarmed," he testified.</TE>
<TE>   Messages From God</TE>
<TE>   Just before the fatal incident, dorm mates and others noticed a
grandiosity in David Attias. He reportedly drifted into delusion,
believing he was a prophet and that the rap lyrics he listened to
contained messages from God.</TE>
<TE>   According to Earley, the Friday night Attias went out cruising in
Isla Vista's pedestrian-choked streets, he was convinced he had to
lose his virginity or he would die.</TE>
<TE>   The incident focused fresh attention on the alcohol-saturated
party scene that prevails in the Isla Vista neighborhood on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Local governments have taken a number of steps to improve safety,
including approving the installation of fencing on the cliffs
overlooking the beach to prevent students from falling off. They also
are considering giving local deputies increased power to shut down
out-of-control parties.</TE>
<TE>   Brighter streetlights have been installed along Sabado Tarde.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor McKinley painted a different portrait. He put on
witnesses to show that Attias was reckless and arrogant as much as
unbalanced.</TE>
<TE>   One therapist testified to the young man's strong sense of
entitlement and belief that he was smarter than everyone around him.</TE>
<TE>   One thing that emerged from the trial was that life was never easy
for David Attias. According to testimony, he was made fun of,
especially when he tried to dance and meet coeds. He was nicknamed
"Crazy Dave."</TE>
<TE>   One challenge facing the jury was to reconcile these contrasting
images of the defendant with the person who sat mutely at the defense
table. Often dressed in a gray sweater--though he wore a blue one
Wednesday--and medicated, he frequently looked disinterested.</TE>
<TE>   His father rarely looked at him when he was on the stand, and the
younger Attias almost never turned to look into the audience when
they were in court.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of the dead were in frequent attendance, sitting on the
other side of the courtroom from Attias' friends and family, though
none was in court Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Those killed in the tragedy were Ellie Israel, 27, and Christopher
Divis, Ruth Levy and Nicholas Bourdakis, all 20.</TE>
<TE>   All were walking along Sabado Tarde in Isla Vista when Attias' car
struck them. A fifth victim, Albert Levy, suffered serious injuries
but recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Levy and Israel were in town from San Francisco, visiting Ruth
Levy, the night of the incident.</TE>

<HD>Joseph Bau, 81; Israeli Artist, Animator, Holocaust
Survivor</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Joseph Bau, a renowned Israeli artist and Holocaust survivor whose
secret marriage in a concentration camp in Poland was immortalized in
"Schindler's List" and whose own wartime efforts enabled more than
400 fellow Jews to escape, has died. He was 81.</LD>
<LD>   Bau, who was among the 1,100 Jews saved by Nazi industrialist
Oskar Schindler, died May 24 in a Tel Aviv hospital, where he had
undergone treatment for pneumonia.</LD>
<LD>   After immigrating to Israel in 1950, Bau became known in the media
as the Israeli Walt Disney for introducing animation to his new
country.</LD>
<TE>   He produced animated shorts for movie theaters and television,
produced animated public service announcements and created the
opening and closing titles and credits for virtually every Israeli
movie made from the 1950s through the '70s.</TE>
<TE>   In his later years, Bau received acclaim for his oil paintings,
which have been exhibited in galleries and Jewish community centers
across the United States and Canada, bearing witness to the tragedies
of the Holocaust and the perseverance of hope in human nature.</TE>
<TE>   Bau also wrote a well-received wartime memoir, "Dear God, Have You
Ever Gone Hungry?" The book, which is illustrated with his dramatic
pen and ink drawings, was published in Hebrew in 1982 and in English,
by Arcade Publishing, in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the horrors, Bau viewed his wartime experiences as a
series of miracles, one of which was meeting his wife, Rebecca, in
Plaszow, a concentration camp on the outskirts of Krakow.</TE>
<TE>   Bau didn't discover until decades later that his beloved, who was
sent to Auschwitz when Plaszow closed, had arranged to have his name
added to Schindler's list.</TE>
<TE>   The son of middle-class, secular Jewish parents, Bau was born in
Krakow in 1920.</TE>
<TE>   He displayed artistic talent at an early age and entered Krakow
University as an art major in 1938.</TE>
<TE>   His art studies came to an abrupt halt the next year, when German
troops invaded Poland and later herded Krakow's Jews into a walled
ghetto.</TE>
<TE>   While at the university, Bau had learned Gothic lettering, and his
ability landed him a job producing maps and signs for the Nazis,
first in the ghetto and then in Plaszow, where many of the prisoners
worked in the nearby factory run by Schindler.</TE>
<TE>   Bau's job enabled him to forge documents and identity papers that
allowed more than 400 Jews to escape the ghetto and the camp.</TE>
<TE>   Years later, when asked why he hadn't forged documents for
himself, Bau replied: "Then who would have done it for the other
Jews?"</TE>
<TE>   "He had a mission to save people," his daughter, Clila Bau-Cohen,
said by telephone from her home near Tel Aviv.</TE>
<TE>   "We would say, 'Tell us, aren't you sad you had to go through this
hell for five years?' He said, 'If I did escape, how would I have met
Mom?'</TE>
<TE>   "That's how our parents raised us: In everything bad, there's
always something good coming out of it."</TE>
<TE>   When Bau met 19-year-old Rebecca Tannenbaum, she was serving as
manicurist for Amon Goeth, the sadistic camp commandant who routinely
tortured the prisoners and shot them for sport.</TE>
<TE>   He kept a gun at Rebecca's elbow, warning that he would shoot her
if she so much as nicked or scratched him.</TE>
<TE>   For Jews in the camp, courtship could be just as lethal.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing that couples who were caught merely holding hands would be
executed, Bau and Tannenbaum shared their first kiss at night behind
the latrine.</TE>
<TE>   And even though any man who was caught in the women's camp after
the gate closed would be shot instantly, Bau went ahead with their
clandestine wedding.</TE>
<TE>   He traded four loaves of bread for a silver spoon and paid four
more loaves to the jeweler in the camp watchmakers' shop to turn the
silver into two wedding rings.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on the night of Feb. 13, 1944, Bau exchanged his striped cap
for the white kerchief that women used to cover their shaved heads
and sneaked into his mother's hut in the women's camp.</TE>
<TE>   There, as he and his bride stood next to his mother's bunk, she
performed the unofficial wedding ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Bau later scoffed at Steven Spielberg's cinematic version of the
wedding, in which friends build a makeshift ceremonial wedding tent
out of a bedsheet held up by two brooms.</TE>
<TE>   "That's complete nonsense," Bau told a reporter. "Whoever heard of
sheets in a camp--we slept on rags."</TE>
<TE>   After the ceremony, the newlyweds went to Rebecca's hut, where
they climbed up to her pallet on the third tier and waited for the
lights to go out. They never did: The Germans had begun searching the
women's quarters for concealed men.</TE>
<TE>   It was too late for Bau to escape, so his bride and two of her
bunk mates covered him with the rags they usually used as pillows and
he lay hidden beneath their heads while they pretended to be asleep.</TE>
<TE>   They knew the guards' search had ended when they heard the screams
of two young men who had been discovered and were beaten to death.</TE>
<TE>   Only a miracle, Bau wrote in his memoir, had saved him from being
discovered.</TE>
<TE>   But he knew he wasn't safe yet after hearing the blare of a siren
calling all the men in the camp to the mustering grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Again covering his head with the white kerchief, Bau dashed out of
the hut only to discover that the electrified gate was closed.</TE>
<TE>   As a searchlight swept by, he decided to risk leaping over the
electrified fence.</TE>
<TE>   Score yet another miracle as he landed safely on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   When Plaszow was being closed down and Schindler began drawing up
his now-famous list of Jews who would work at his new factory in
Czechoslovakia, Rebecca visited Goeth's Jewish male secretary to
remind him that he owed her a favor for the time she prevented a
guard from shooting his mother.</TE>
<TE>   When the secretary started to write down her name on the list,
Rebecca substituted her husband's name.</TE>
<TE>   Bau didn't find out what his wife had done until after the movie
"Schindler's List" was released in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca Bau told a reporter that she had had faith in her own
survival but feared for her husband.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband was more important to me than I was, and I wasn't
afraid," she said.</TE>
<TE>   While Bau went to Czechoslovakia to work at Schindler's factory,
his wife was sent to Auschwitz, where she managed to talk her way out
of being sent to the gas chamber three times.</TE>
<TE>   The Baus were reunited after the war and legally married Feb. 13,
1946, two years to the day from their unofficial camp wedding.</TE>
<TE>   "They always celebrated two dates," said Bau-Cohen. "They were
such a special couple."</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca Bau died in 1997 after 53 years of marriage.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Bau-Cohen, Bau is survived by another daughter,
Hadasa Bau, who divides her time between Winnipeg, Canada, and
Ramat-Gan, Israel; and four grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Lawyer Bids to Get Blake Out on Bail</HD>
<DH>Crime: Actor's attorney asks the judge to throw out the
lying-in-wait element of the murder charge. He also says police
compromised the investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Blake's attorney asked a Los Angeles judge Wednesday to reduce
the murder charge against the actor and let him out of jail on bail.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Harland W. Braun also resumed his war of words with
prosecutors, saying Los Angeles police detectives compromised their
investigation by allowing a freelance author to watch them at work.</LD>
<LD>   Blake, star of the "Baretta" television series of the late 1970s,
was arrested in April and charged with murdering his wife, Bonny Lee
Bakley. Police allege that he approached five people to kill her
before shooting her to death in Studio City last year.</LD>
<TE>   In court papers, Braun argued that the lying-in-wait allegation
should be declared unconstitutional and the charge dismissed. Without
that element, Blake would no longer face capital charges and would be
eligible for bail, Braun said. To prove the lying-in-wait allegation,
prosecutors must show the same things they would have to demonstrate
to convict Blake of the lesser crime of first-degree murder. That,
Braun argued, permits prosecutors to arbitrarily decide who will and
will not face the death penalty, and is unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   A San Diego trial judge declared the same statute
unconstitutionally vague earlier this month in an unrelated capital
murder case.</TE>
<TE>   Although that ruling is not binding on other judges, Braun hopes
that Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash will make a
similar finding in the Blake case.</TE>
<TE>   Nash denied a previous bail request. He ruled last month that
Blake was not eligible for bail because he is charged with a capital
crime, although prosecutors have said they will not seek execution.</TE>
<TE>   Braun again argued that Blake does not pose a flight risk or a
danger to society and said his client has cooperated with authorities
in the year since the crime. He said prosecutors charged Blake with
the special circumstance of lying in wait solely to deny him bail.</TE>
<TE>   The actor, 68, has been held without bail at the Men's Central
Jail downtown since his arrest April 18 at the Hidden Hills home
where he lived with his daughters. A hearing on Braun's motion is set
for Tuesday in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney also said Wednesday that the presence of author Miles
Corwin at the crime scene, at Blake's home and at witness interviews
"tainted the investigation." It also gave police "a hidden agenda"
for targeting the actor as the prime suspect, the attorney said.
Corwin at the time was on a book leave from the Los Angeles Times. He
left the paper in January.</TE>
<TE>   "What if they hadn't charged Blake in the murder?" Braun asked.
"Then how would the book end?"</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Cmdr. Gary Brennan said Wednesday that Corwin spent a year
researching a book on the department's Robbery-Homicide Division,
observing five criminal investigations, including Bakley's. He said
the arrangement with Corwin, who did not return telephone calls
Wednesday seeking comment, was approved by then-Chief Bernard C.
Parks and does not violate department policy.</TE>
<TE>   "We are absolutely confident it doesn't compromise the case, the
credibility of detectives," Brennan said. "When the trial is
concluded, we are sure any objective observers will agree with us
when they have full access to the facts.</TE>
<TE>   "Harland Braun might want us to debate and discuss the merits of
the case in the media," he said. "It is a debate we refuse to engage
in. This is a homicide investigation being conducted with credibility
and professionalism."</TE>

<HD>Bill Blass, 79; Defined American Style</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIMI AVINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Blass, the designer who in his 50-year career helped define a
distinctly American style of fashion, died Wednesday night at his
home in New Preston, Conn. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Blass' death was confirmed by friend Helen O'Hagan, who said he
died of cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Although Blass had the manners and poise of Cary Grant, dressed
like an English gentleman and spoke with an upper-class accent of
indeterminate origin, he was born in Fort Wayne, Ind., the son of a
hardware store owner. If he wasn't an aristocrat by birth, he
understood how those who were wanted to dress: in flattering, classic
clothing that was neither too flashy nor avant-garde. Before Blass
and a few other innovators capitalized on American women's ability to
make sporty clothes look dashing, a more formal, fussy style,
dictated by Paris designers, ruled international fashion.</LD>
<TE>   His role in New York society was as precedent-setting as his
designs. Before Blass, designers were unknown hired hands who would
literally and figuratively use the back door. He was the first
"dressmaker" to be accepted into the same caste as his clients, and
his social ascent changed the status of ambitious designers, paving
the way for the era of the designer as celebrity, when Ralph Lauren,
Calvin Klein and Donna Karan became superstars whose sales benefited
from their carefully marketed images.</TE>
<TE>   Why Blass?</TE>
<TE>   "He was special," said Michael Groveman, who ran Blass' company
for more than a decade. "He walked into a room, and he filled it up."</TE>
<TE>   When Blass came to New York in 1939, his idea of fashion was
inspired by the glamorous lives he had seen portrayed in Hollywood
films of the Depression by stars such as Carole Lombard and Constance
Bennett. The New York garment district was a rough neighborhood then,
but he didn't lose sight of the images of stylish women that
initially drew him to fashion. Before long, he got to know the
real-life counterparts of Hollywood's sophisticates, and demonstrated
a knack for creating clothes they wanted to wear.</TE>
<TE>   In a memoir published in the New Yorker magazine in 1997, Blass
wrote that, before World War II, "the city was the most extraordinary
place to see wonderfully dressed women. Everybody dressed up. You put
on clothes for lunch, clothes for cocktails, clothes for dinner,
whereas today you go to work, lunch and dinner in the same ... black
pantsuit."</TE>
<TE>   As women's wardrobes changed, Blass adapted. Yet he never stopped
offering proper suits for day and dazzling evening gowns. He was so
inventive that often younger designers would discover a look--a
cashmere sweater and ball-gown skirt as a relaxed alternative to an
evening dress, for example--only to realize that Blass had done it 30
years earlier. Camel's hair polo coats, peacoats and striped sailor's
T-shirts, the sort of garments that Ralph Lauren later made staples
of his collections, were first elevated by Blass. He remade these
preppy basics in luxurious fabrics, or combined them with more
elegant pieces, before the juxtaposition of opposites was an accepted
fashion idiom.</TE>
<TE>   After beginning his career as a sketcher, the designer served in
the Army for three years, then returned to an industry still heavily
influenced by European fashion. Yet, he realized, "American women
have a way of wearing clothes which doesn't date them. The
best-dressed ones have had a sense of themselves which didn't depend
in the least on what the world was wearing. And so it came to me that
there could be a way of designing for women that was, in the best
sense, American."</TE>
<TE>   According to Blass, "A certain nonchalance is always a constant in
American clothes .... Having the confidence to mix things up is very
American." He applauded women who wore his tailored jackets over Gap
T-shirts, tucked into Banana Republic trousers.</TE>
<TE>   He called his loyal followers "gals," and his clients, who
included Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush, Barbara Walters and the late
Katharine Graham and Pamela Harriman, became friends. Although he
made several attempts at marketing moderately priced lines, his forte
was expensive clothing (a suit would cost $3,500), for a group often
described as "the ladies who lunch." If he addressed one of them as
"babe," or "kid," it wasn't because he couldn't remember names, but
because he liked the sound of it. And so did they.</TE>
<TE>   A sought-after escort, Blass knew the tastes and preferences of
his affluent clientele because he was a guest in their homes and
attended their charity benefits. For all his social dexterity, he
acknowledged he didn't relate well to people on a personal level, and
details of his private life were kept secret.</TE>
<TE>   Louise Grunwald, wife of former U.S. Ambassador and Time Magazine
editor Henry Grunwald, a Blass client and friend, said, "Bill was
very winning, but in a wry and ironic, not a saccharine way. That
shouldn't sell dresses, but somehow it does. He's a man who wears
well in many different situations, with a wide range of interests--he
probably read three books a week. He was very talented, and
understood American women and that they like to look pretty, and I'm
not sure that a lot of designers get that today. His clothes were
truly timeless. I wish I'd held onto some Blass things I had 25 years
ago, because they'd still look wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s, Blass became known as a designer for Maurice
Rentner. He was one of the first American designers to have his name
on a label--Bill Blass for Maurice Rentner, initially. When he bought
the company in 1970, changing its name to Bill Blass, it was rare for
a designer to own his own firm. He proved to be a shrewd businessman,
breaking new ground in exploring the lucrative world of licensing,
putting his name on everything from menswear to home furnishings.</TE>
<TE>   A menswear line introduced in 1967 was hugely successful, in part
because men wanted to dress like him. "His personal style was so
remarkable," said Los Angeles socialite Nancy Vreeland, who worked
with Blass from 1966 until the early '70s. "He very much respected
and patterned himself after the Duke of Windsor. He brought a keen
appreciation of masculine tailoring and fabrics to his women's
clothes, yet gave them tremendous femininity."</TE>
<TE>   As Blass' name and image became better known, he was even in
demand to design automobile interiors, which he did for Lincoln in
the '70s. And he was the first designer to have his name on
chocolates, in the '80s. He pioneered appearances in department and
specialty stores, where he proved to be a master salesman--a single
visit to a Saks Fifth Avenue branch could bring in $700,000 or more.
By making regular road trips, he became familiar with the wardrobe
needs of women in cities like St. Louis and Cincinnati. He wasn't
always the darling of fashion magazines, but Blass' gals, throughout
the country, were loyal.</TE>
<TE>   "Those trips taught me about what works and doesn't work in
different parts of the country," Blass wrote in his New Yorker
memoir. "Black, of course, was a New York invention. But in bright,
sunny cities like Houston and Los Angeles, black looks terrible. I
always say to women that when you're out at night and in a sea of men
in dark suits, wear red or white and you'll be noticed."</TE>
<TE>   A founding member of the Council of Fashion Designers of America
and the trade organization's honorary president from 1979 to 1981,
Blass received the group's lifetime achievement award in 1997 and a
special award as the Dean of American Fashion in June 2000. He was
the first recipient of a CFDA award for humanitarianism, which
recognized his support of AIDS research and other charities. In 1994,
the Bill Blass Public Reading Room was dedicated, to commemorate his
$10-million endowment to the New York Public Library.</TE>
<TE>   Blass suffered a minor stroke in December 1998, while at a Saks
Fifth Avenue store in Houston. He retired after his Spring 2000
collection was presented in September 1999. Groveman, who had been
chief financial officer, bought the $700-million-a-year company.</TE>
<TE>   A diagnosis of tongue cancer early in 2000 made it difficult for
Blass to remain as involved with the company as he had intended when
he gave up full-time designing chores, but by the end of the year, he
was feeling strong enough to work part time.</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- By the time Lt. Morris Jeppson stepped off the B-29
that day, it was clear this had been no ordinary mission: The plane
was called the Enola Gay, and the United States had just unleashed
atomic power as a weapon.</LD>
<LD>   So Jeppson, like other crew members, grabbed a few keepsakes --
namely, the green and red "plugs" that had deactivated, then armed,
the bomb, dubbed "Little Boy." He tossed the thumb-sized switches
into his duffel bag.</LD>
<LD>   This week, several wars and 57 years later, Jeppson sold the plugs
at a San Francisco auction--and suddenly, the federal government is
very interested once again in a couple of forgotten tokens from the
birth of the Nuclear Age.</LD>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors in San Francisco have asked a judge to block
sale of the artifacts. In court documents, the Air Force Material
Command Law Office argues that the plugs are classified military
property, not souvenirs, and are potentially dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing is scheduled for Friday morning. Government
representatives say they will ask for a restraining order blocking
the auction, which brought $150,000 to Jeppson, now a retiree living
in Las Vegas, and a $17,500 commission to Butterfields Auctioneers
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Implicit in the government's argument is that the time is not
right to encourage public dissemination of weapons technology--not
when authorities are investigating whether Al Qaeda operatives
planned to detonate a radioactive bomb in America.</TE>
<TE>   "That whole issue will be fleshed out in documents that will be
filed," Jocelyn Burton, chief of the civil division at the U.S.
attorney's office in San Francisco, said of the dispute, first
reported in several Bay Area newspapers. For those involved in the
sale, however, the government's vigilance seems overblown.</TE>
<TE>   Not only are the plugs defunct technology, they argue, but they
have been displayed in the past in museums. What's more, they are
merely the mechanism that armed the bomb and had nothing to do with
its inner workings--making them little more complicated than the
electrical switches that operate a household toaster, the buyer said
in an interview Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The security issue is absurd," said Clay Perkins, 68, of Rancho
Santa Fe, a former rocket scientist for General Dynamics who has
dabbled in San Diego-area real estate development since his
retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Perkins bought the plugs at auction Tuesday, but the sale was
temporarily blocked by the government before he could take delivery.</TE>
<TE>   "They say this poses a risk to the public," Perkins said. "There
is simply no way that knowing what is inside these plugs would be of
any scintilla of use to anyone who wants to understand how a nuclear
bomb works."</TE>
<TE>   Perkins said the plugs will be displayed in his home amid his
collection of rare military memorabilia, including a Spanish cannon
carried on a ship that was sunk in the 16th century.</TE>
<TE>   The "Little Boy" A-bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, on Aug.
6, 1945.</TE>
<TE>   The blast killed about 80,000 people. Tens of thousands more died
later from the after-effects. The U.S. military's decision to drop
the bomb has been second-guessed ever since, with some seeing it as a
merciless attack on civilians. Others say there is little question
that the bomb, and a second one dropped on Nagasaki, forced Japan to
surrender and brought World War II to a close.</TE>
<TE>   That first bomb contained an array of machinery that, at the time,
was highly sophisticated, including radar systems and barometric
sensors that ensured it wouldn't detonate until it was a scant 1,500
feet above Hiroshima. What's more, the bomb itself was still
experimental, despite a series of successful tests.</TE>
<TE>   "If it had blown up early, it would have been awfully embarrassing
to wipe out the whole Air Force," Perkins said.</TE>
<TE>   So military engineers installed two types of plugs--green ones
that effectively shorted out the bomb's electrical connections, and
red ones that completed the connections and armed the bomb. Shortly
before the bomb was dropped, Jeppson, a weapons test officer, crept
into the Enola Gay's unpressurized bomb bay and switched the plugs,
arming the bomb.</TE>
<TE>   "That was my job," Jeppson said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   After the flight, Jeppson kept three of the green plugs, gave away
two and took one home. The red plugs used to arm the bomb were
destroyed in the blast. The red plug that was sold at the auction was
an extra that apparently was aboard the plane but was not used.</TE>
<TE>   "These are arguably the most important historical objects that
came out of the 20th century," Perkins said. "They are the only thing
left of the first bomb that used nuclear energy. [The bombs] started
the good, peaceful uses of nuclear energy, as well as war
applications."</TE>
<TE>   Monique Crine, a Butterfields spokeswoman, said: "The case against
us is made without merit.... We really anticipate that the matter
will be resolved shortly."</TE>
<TE>   The plugs were just one piece of a large aviation memorabilia
auction at Butterfields this week.</TE>
<TE>   The auction included a tan aviator's suit worn by famed World War
I ace Eddie Rickenbacker, a photograph of a 1903 flight signed by
Orville Wright, and a pistol that aviator Charles Lindbergh carried
to the 1935 trial of the man accused of kidnapping Lindbergh's baby.</TE>
<TE>   A number of other Enola Gay artifacts also were sold, most of them
from the collection of Theodore "Dutch" Van Kirk, the B-29's
navigator. The collection includes the original in-flight navigator's
guide and Van Kirk's clock, sextant and radio headset.</TE>
<TE>   Van Kirk's collection, however, did not include any of the
plugs--and they brought, by far, the most money of any of the Enola
Gay artifacts this week.</TE>
<TE>   "These are keepsakes," Jeppson said. "There is nothing secret
about them. And they are not government property."</TE>

<HD>Suit Accusing Cooley of Malicious Prosecution Is Dismissed</HD>
<DH>Court: Judge says the plaintiff, who was tried in a bribery
case in 1995, did not prove his case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge Wednesday dismissed a suit accusing Los Angeles
County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley and a fellow prosecutor of malicious
prosecution in a 1995 bribery and perjury trial against a defense
attorney.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Dean D. Pregerson, granting a motion by Cooley
to dismiss the suit, said Leonard R. Milstein of San Luis Obispo
failed to prove his allegation that the prosecutors "engaged in any
coercive or abusive techniques" in their investigation.</LD>
<LD>   Milstein, formerly of Woodland Hills, had charged that Cooley, who
was a deputy district attorney in 1995, coerced an inmate to give
false testimony in the bribery trial. Milstein's suit said Cooley
launched the investigation against him although he knew or should
have known that he was innocent.</LD>
<TE>   Cooley on Wednesday called Milstein's lawsuit frivolous.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the harassment of frivolous lawsuits such as these, I
have always felt strongly that a public prosecutor's job is to pursue
cases of alleged corruption of the justice system and within
government," he said. "That was the case then [in the Milstein
probe]. That is the case now."</TE>
<TE>   Wiley Ramey, Milstein's lawyer, said he will appeal the decision
to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. "I am very disappointed in
the judge," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Milstein's suit charged that Cooley and Robert Foltz launched the
bribery and perjury investigation against him in retaliation for his
successful defense in 1989 of a man accused of the drug-related
murders of two men</TE>
<TE>   During the capital murder trial, Milstein directed suspicion away
from his client and toward a key prosecution witness by calling a
County Jail inmate to testify against the prosecution witness.</TE>
<TE>   The jury acquitted Milstein's client of one murder charge and
deadlocked on the second. He later pleaded guilty to a reduced charge
of manslaughter and received an eight-year sentence.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, Cooley visited the inmate behind bars. Cooley later said
the inmate admitted fabricating evidence and lying during his
testimony in the murder trial at Milstein's request.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley then launched the prosecution against Milstein and won a
conviction in May 1995. Milstein was sentenced to three years in
prison, but a state appellate court threw out the conviction,
declaring that it was based on insufficient evidence.</TE>
<TE>   In his ruling, Pregerson rejected claims that Cooley should not
have investigated Milstein because he should have known the lawyer
was innocent. The judge said the prosecutors started the probe
because three inmates reported that Milstein tried to persuade them
to give false testimony at the murder trial.</TE>
<TE>   "The record of the investigation shows that there was evidence
that perjury and obstruction of justice may have occurred during the
... trial," Pregerson wrote, referring to the murder trial of
Milstein's client.</TE>
<TE>   Noting Milstein's 1995 conviction, Pregerson said that the later
reversal "does not prove innocence." Nor does it show that Cooley
should have known when he authorized the probe that Milstein was
innocent, the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   He said there was no evidence Cooley or Foltz applied any "undue
influence" on investigators.</TE>
<TE>   "The court finds that [Milstein] has not pointed to evidence that
supports the proposition that [Cooley and Foltz] used investigative
techniques that were so coercive and abusive that they knew or should
have known that those techniques would yield false information."</TE>

<LD>   Ron Le, Jack San and Anthony Nguyen were not their usual talkative
selves, she said. Duran, 17, remembers going to class with Nguyen and
wondering why he was sitting at the back of the room, resting his
head on the desk. And Tho Ton wasn't even at school.</LD>
<LD>   Her worries were warranted. Ton wasn't at school because he had
been arrested the day before. The other three would be arrested later
Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Students at Bolsa Grande High School in Garden Grove were stunned
by the news that the four, all seniors, face court dates in the
killing of a 14-year-old while their classmates are getting ready for
Wednesday's graduation ceremonies.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Fernandez was gunned down early Saturday morning after
taking a cab from an Internet cafe in Garden Grove. Le and San, both
18, and Nguyen, 17, face charges of murder with gang enhancement
allegations in the crime. Nguyen was charged as an adult. Prosecutors
added a lying-in-wait allegation to the other charges for Ton, 18,
which could make him eligible for the death penalty. He is being held
without bail. The other three are being held in lieu of $500,000
bail. Arraignment is scheduled for June 28.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is really shocked," Duran said. "They would be the last
people that I would expect to be in a gang. They really never got in
trouble until now."</TE>
<TE>   While police describe the youngsters as notorious gang members,
their school peers call them caring, respectful students who were
involved in campus activities. Ton, Nguyen and San were on the
school's varsity basketball team. Le is a teacher's assistant for the
business law class.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disappointing," said Chris Sanchez, 17, who took the class
and described Le as friendly and always joking with students. "I'm
struggling to graduate and it's shocking for something like this to
happen so close to our graduation. Anything can happen."</TE>
<TE>   Police would not reveal details of the students' records or their
alleged gang involvement to protect the ongoing investigation. They
still don't know the motive for the shooting, Garden Grove Police Lt.
Scott Hamilton said.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting occurred about 12:50 a.m. Saturday at the
intersection of Lampson Avenue and Adelle Street after Fernandez and
his friends exchanged hostile looks with several youths in the
parking lot of the I.C.E. Internet Cafe on Brookhurst Street. Police
believe the older teenagers followed the boys' taxicab in one or more
cars and that one of them shot the 14-year-old as he paid the cab
fare.</TE>
<TE>   Neither police nor prosecutors would identify which suspect they
believe was the gunman. Fernandez was not tied to a gang, police
said, but they are treating the incident as a gang-involved crime.</TE>

<HD>Board Scrubs Plan to Fence Popular Sand Dune</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calling the idea too drastic, Manhattan Beach's City Council has
rejected a proposal to build a fence around a 100-foot-high sand dune
that draws athletes and children from around Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   The city's Parks and Recreation Department proposed the fence
after residents complained about crowds converging on the dune during
the summer, blocking driveways with cars and leaving litter. In
addition to the fence, the department wanted to require adult users
to make reservations before climbing the dune.</LD>
<LD>   "A fence sends out a message that no one's welcome in this
community and that's just not true," said Councilman Walt Dougher,
who along with the rest of the council voted against the proposal.
"The reservation system was a little too bureaucratic and the fence
was just a little draconian, in my opinion." Sand Dune Park covers a
three-acre parcel in a residential area and has only two parking
spots, both designated for disabled people.</LD>
<TE>   On summer weekends, the dune can draw more than 300 people a day,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   About 2,550 used the dune in March, a 52% increase from the same
time last year.</TE>
<TE>   For years, neighbors have complained of unruly fitness buffs who
wake them from their slumber.</TE>
<TE>   "It's chaos," said Steve Santos, a member of Residents for Sand
Dune Safety, a group that supported fencing as a way of controlling
the number of people who used the dune.</TE>
<TE>   Other Manhattan Beach residents opposed the idea, fearing it would
limit public access.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, the City Council is an elected body and it accurately
read the feeling of the community," said Larry Teitelbaum, who
mobilized a group of Manhattan Beach residents against a fence at the
park.</TE>
<TE>   The council did give the Parks and Recreation staff the power to
temporarily close the park if problems of noise, traffic and litter
become worse.</TE>
<TE>   Santos called it a Band-Aid solution: "It's not going to fix the
problem," he said. "We'll be back here next year."</TE>

<HD>Council Bid to Kill DWP Pact Delayed</HD>
<DH>Spending: Vote on PR contract to promote conservation is
postponed after activists pack chambers to support the deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some two dozen community activists spoke in support of the Department
of Water and Power's $2.4-million contract with a public relations
firm to promote conservation, prompting the Los Angeles City Council
on Wednesday to put off a decision on whether to kill it.</LD>
<LD>   The contract was approved by the DWP Board of Commissioners last
week against the wishes of Mayor James K. Hahn and Controller Laura
Chick. The two had wanted DWP to wait until Chick finishes an audit
of the $60-million public-benefits program, which funds the contract.
The audit is expected to be finished next month.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Jack Weiss, who sponsored the motion to veto the
contract, remained optimistic after Wednesday's hearing.</LD>
<TE>   "We certainly got their attention, and there are a number of
serious questions which remain on the table," he said. "I want to
make sure we're getting everything we can possibly get for every buck
we spend."</TE>
<TE>   DWP officials say the contract with the Lee Andrews Group is
essential to helping them promote an energy conservation program
called Green LA. Delaying the contract as the city enters the hot
summer months would be a mistake, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be some loss of programs and momentum if we don't have
the money over the next few weeks," said David Wiggs, DWP's general
manager.</TE>
<TE>   The PR firm will work with community-based organizations to spread
DWP's message on renewable energy, conservation, energy efficiency
and other environmental issues through next May 31. The contract
includes an optional one-year, $2.4-million extension.</TE>
<TE>   However, Chick, a longtime critic of the agency, said Wiggs and
other DWP officials were "dishonest" and "disingenuous" during the
hearing. Chick said she was disappointed that the council failed to
take action and that attention was diverted from the appropriateness
of the contract to the value of conserving energy.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened in council were some very interesting attempts to
turn people's attention from what this really was about," she said.
"This was about a multimillion-dollar public-relations contract. It's
not about disrupting environmental and community services. Absolutely
not."</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of religious leaders, environmentalists, businessmen and
others packed the council chambers to support the contract.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Cox appeared dressed as Green Power Girl, a superhero
created to promote Green LA. Wearing a green wig, huge sunglasses and
a cape, she told council members she has talked to students in 60
schools. "I'm just urging you to without delay support this
contract," she said. "Support programs like [this] that really
outreach to the community. You don't have to wear a cape to be a hero
if you conserve energy."</TE>
<TE>   Members of churches and temples throughout the city supported the
program's goals.</TE>
<TE>   "This program mirrors what we teach our children about caring for
the Earth," said Michael Cunningham, administrator of the Episcopal
Diocese of Los Angeles. "We hold these program up as an example of
what we teach our children."</TE>
<TE>   Weiss' motion was scheduled to be considered at the next council
meeting. Late Wednesday, however, Weiss proposed a compromise that
would allow DWP to retain the PR firm without tying up city funds for
a year. In a letter to Wiggs and DWP Commission President Kenneth
Lombard, Weiss proposed retaining the firm on a month-to-month
contract until Chick's audit is completed.</TE>

<HD>State Weathers Shift of FBI Agents to Counterterrorism</HD>
<DH>Intelligence: Move will have little impact in California's
other operations, including drug enforcement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A nationwide shift of more than 500 FBI agents to counterterrorism
jobs will have little impact on other operations of the four major
FBI offices in California--even drug investigations, officials say.</LD>
<LD>   One reason is that many agents had already transferred to
counterterrorism duties in California long before last week's
announcement by FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III.</LD>
<LD>   The transfer of narcotics agents to counterterrorism is likely to
involve relatively fewer agents in California, because the state is a
major drug trouble spot, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Mueller announced last week that the FBI was transferring 400
narcotics agents and 118 white-collar and violent crime agents to
counterterrorism duty--increasing the nation's counterterrorism force
to 3,718.</TE>
<TE>   "We are waiting now for congressional approval of this plan," said
FBI Assistant Director Ron Iden, head of the FBI's 650-agent Los
Angeles office. "With regard to L.A., the shifts have already been
pretty much made.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be some reduction in our work in drug enforcement, but
we will continue to work the high-priority cases," Iden said. "There
won't be a situation here in L.A. where we're entirely pulling out of
investigative cases.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be no impact on white-collar or organized crime," Iden
added. "The number of agents in L.A. will remain the same."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. Debra W. Yang agreed with Iden's assessment. She said
the reallocation of FBI resources since Sept. 11 has had no
noticeable impact on criminal cases handled by her office "and I
don't expect it will" as a result of the latest shift.</TE>
<TE>   Michele Leonhart, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration's
Los Angeles office, agreed that the DEA and FBI will continue to work
major drug cases in the area with other police agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "On any given day, we have maybe 10 or 20 FBI agents working cases
with DEA squads," she said. "We will hope that doesn't change much,
because the drug problem is so enormous in this area. On the other
hand, we also realize that their primary mission is terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   While FBI officials usually resist giving detailed numbers of how
many agents are assigned to specific squads, some insight into the
counterterrorism shift was provided by Larry A. Mefford, assistant
special agent in charge of the San Francisco division, in April
testimony to a congressional subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   "Since Sept. 11 ... approximately 30 agents [in San Francisco]
have been reassigned to the counterterrorism program," he testified.
"This doubles the number of agents conducting terrorism-related
investigations."</TE>
<TE>   Mefford added: "The reorganization resulted in terrorism squads
being located in the major metropolitan areas of San Francisco,
Oakland and San Jose. The geographical placement of these squads
enhances the counterterrorism program's abilities to address the
terrorism threat throughout the region."</TE>
<TE>   Most San Francisco agents transferred to counterterrorism were
taken from drug and organized crime squads, Mefford said.</TE>
<TE>   DEA officials in San Francisco said they expect to maintain the
number of investigations in the area, despite the loss of some
assistance from the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   "They certainly help us some, but we will be able to keep the same
level of operations," said DEA spokesman Rich Myer.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Mason, new head of the FBI's Sacramento office, which has
more than 100 agents, said the key for a relatively smaller regional
office is flexibility.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to have 30 people doing counterterrorism, but half
of them not knowing what they are doing," he said. "We just can't let
our white-collar force dwindle, because there are areas we work here
that we don't work elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect we will lose a few drug agents," Mason added. "But we
will stay active in the multi-agency groups we already work with."</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, both the DEA and FBI have long worked closely in
combating major Mexican drug smuggling organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "It remains to be seen how many people will be cut, but I would
think it would be really minimal," said Donald Thornhill, DEA
spokesman in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they recognize the drug fight here as particularly
difficult. But whatever they end up doing, we will step up to the
plate and do whatever is necessary."</TE>

<HD>Fireworks Ban Fizzles as Fillmore OKs Sales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sticking with tradition, the city of Fillmore will celebrate the
Fourth of July with the usual snap, crackle and pop.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council on Tuesday night decided to go forward with the
sale of so-called safe and sane fireworks, despite pressure from
Ventura County officials concerned about the potential for more brush
fires.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Don Gunderson said such sales would discourage the use of
the illegal kind, which are much more powerful and can be fired great
distances.</LD>
<TE>   "We'll maintain the status quo," he said. "It's better ... than
creating a situation where more illegal fireworks might be used."</TE>
<TE>   The council's decision came after county Supervisor John Flynn and
county Fire Chief Bob Roper urged the city to suspend fireworks sales
in light of the 21,000-acre wildfire burning in nearby Los Padres
National Forest. The cost to fight that blaze, which began June 1,
has exceeded $13 million. Fillmore is one of 229 cities
statewide--but the only one in Ventura County--that allows nonprofit
groups to sell fireworks during the week leading up to the Fourth of
July. The devices, approved by the state fire marshal, do not
explode, dart across the ground or lift into the air.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, safe and sane fireworks can start fires, particularly if
they are tossed into the trash while still hot or if set off in the
woods.</TE>
<TE>   At least nine fires in Ventura County were started by fireworks in
recent years, costing more than $5.6 million to extinguish.</TE>
<TE>   Fillmore Fire Chief Pat Askren assured council members at their
Tuesday meeting that the state fire marshal has no plans to curb
fireworks sales throughout California. But he recommended the city
prepare fliers advising customers that current weather conditions
make it particularly important that fireworks be used properly.</TE>
<TE>   "If you set it in the middle of the street, it doesn't set a
fire," Askren said. "If you take it out in the brush, you will set a
fire."</TE>
<TE>   Groups that sell fireworks in Fillmore also are being asked to
remind out-of-town customers that it is probably illegal to set them
off where they live. In Ventura County, only Fillmore allows amateur
fireworks displays.</TE>
<TE>   As a member of the Sunrisers Rotary Club, Gunderson has worked at
the group's fireworks sales booth in the past. "When customers ask,
the information we provide is: 'We do not know what the ordinances
and regulations are in your area, but you are welcome to set them off
in any of our public parks, at school grounds and at the high school
stadium before the fireworks show,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fillmore has been a mecca for regional revelers willing to drive
up to an hour for fireworks to take home. "I'm not responsible for
the people of the city of Thousand Oaks or the San Fernando Valley,"
Askren said. "When they take them back and set them off across their
city lines, they're breaking the law. But I can't enforce it."</TE>
<TE>   Flynn had asked county attorneys to look for ways to stop
Fillmore, but lawyers said the law does not give the county power to
regulate city fireworks sales.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's governor this week halted all amateur fireworks sales
because of the fires engulfing that state. But in California, Gov.
Gray Davis is not considering such a prohibition. No state lawmakers
from this area have called for such a ban, and Sen. Tom McClintock
(R-Thousand Oaks) said to do so would be un-American.</TE>
<TE>   "Bureaucrats love to treat everyone as if they're irresponsible
children," McClintock said. "I do believe people should be
responsible for using fireworks safely and be held accountable if
they don't. But banning fireworks for every responsible person in the
community is unjust."</TE>

<HD>Security a Top Concern, Fox Says</HD>
<DH>Border: Immigration reform stalls in wake of 9/11 attacks,
according to Mexican president.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TIJUANA</DL>
<LD>Mexican President Vicente Fox said here Wednesday that heightened
security along the U.S.-Mexico border since Sept. 11 has obliterated
any chances of easing immigration regulations in 2002.</LD>
<LD>   "Not this year, maybe next," Fox said at the opening session of
the National Assn. of Hispanic Journalists' 20th annual convention.
"We must ensure that our war against terrorism moves forward." At the
same time, he said, both nations must work to facilitate the movement
of people across the border. More than 1 million cross every day.</LD>
<LD>   Stepped-up security at major crossing points has forced migrants
to take perilous routes across the desert. In the last week, at least
14 Mexican immigrants have died in the Arizona desert and more than
100 have had to be rescued.</LD>
<TE>   "Additional steps must be taken to avoid these painful deaths,"
Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Wednesday, at the Grand Hotel Tijuana, Fox and Gov. Gray
Davis, who is waging an increasingly aggressive campaign for
reelection, said the relationship between the Mexican government and
California is continuing to improve.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico is now California's largest trading partner. Over the past
four years, trade with Mexico has increased more than $4 billion and
created an estimated 50,000 jobs in California.</TE>
<TE>   Davis cited several recent accomplishments, including the sale of
50 megawatts of power from Baja California to the San Diego area, an
amount expected to increase to 200 megawatts--enough to serve 200,000
homes--by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The governor noted that Mexicana Airlines will soon inaugurate a
flight from Mexico City that will stop at Guadalajara before
continuing to Sacramento. And he announced expansion of Blue Shield's
Access Baja HMO, which handles health care benefits for 40,000 people
who live in Baja California and work in California. Davis said the
families of legal workers will now get health care too.</TE>
<TE>   "We are two people with one future, and our future is getting
brighter by the day," Davis said.</TE>

<HD>Police Tape of Westerfield Is Played</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The man accused of killing Danielle van Dam told police that he was
"pretty drunk" the night the girl disappeared and does not remember
the hours after he left a bar where he was trying to socialize with
her mother, according to a police tape-recording played for the jury
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't remember how I got home--that's how bad it was,"
Westerfield told a police interrogation specialist two days after the
7-year-old disappeared. In the same interview, Westerfield denied any
involvement in the abduction.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses have testified that Westerfield was at a neighborhood
bar the night of Feb. 1 while Danielle's mother and two of her female
friends were enjoying a "girls' night out" of drinking, dancing and
smoking marijuana. The girl was found to be missing about 9 a.m. the
next morning.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Westerfield--his advances spurned by
Brenda van Dam and the other women--left the bar early, sneaked into
the Van Dam home and kidnapped Danielle. Her nude, decomposing body
was found Feb. 27 in a rural area.</TE>
<TE>   In the interview with interrogation specialist Paul Redden,
Westerfield denied any amorous intentions toward Brenda van Dam, who
lived two doors away, saying, "She's not my type."</TE>
<TE>   He also said he could not recall Danielle.</TE>
<TE>   "If you brought [Danielle] in right now, I wouldn't be able to
tell her from five other, 10 other, kids," Westerfield is heard
saying on the tape-recording. "I wouldn't be able to recognize her."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Westerfield stuffed Danielle's body into
his recreational vehicle and, after a meandering trip of several
hundred miles to the Imperial Valley desert, dumped her body "like
trash" in the Dehesa area of San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   In his interview with Redden, Westerfield said he was in the
desert scouting for camping places to take his son.</TE>
<TE>   "Does this sound weird to you?" he asked Redden. "It's perfectly
normal for me."</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Westerfield referred to a spot in the desert as
"this little place we were at." Redden said he found the use of "we"
suspicious, because Westerfield insisted that he was alone.</TE>
<TE>   In court documents released before the trial, Redden is quoted as
saying that he concluded that Westerfield was lying about not being
involved in the disappearance.</TE>

<HD>Guard Jailed on Suspicion of Groping 2 Patients</HD>

<LD>A Glendale hospital security guard is in jail for allegedly groping
two female patients and inappropriately touching another, authorities
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Fernando Rivas, 40, was arrested early Sunday after Glendale
Adventist Medical Center staff contacted police about a patient
complaint, Glendale Police Sgt. Kirk Palmer said.</LD>
<LD>   The Eagle Rock resident was charged Tuesday with two counts of
sexual battery and one count of battery and is being held in lieu of
$75,000 bail in Los Angeles County Jail, Palmer said.</LD>
<TE>   On June 2, a 45-year-old woman told hospital staff that a security
guard matching Rivas' description groped her, hospital spokeswoman
Alicia Gonzalez said. But police were not called until two more women
complained Sunday, Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital has disciplined the two employees who failed to
report the June 2 incident, Gonzalez said.</TE>
<TE>   A statement from the medical center said that it "takes this
matter very seriously. The hospital regrets the incident and is
sparing no effort or resources to fully examine processes in the
interest of protecting our patients."</TE>
<TE>   Glendale Adventist has placed the company that Rivas worked for,
Healthcare Security Services, on a 90-day probation, during which
time the hospital will decide whether to keep its services, Gonzalez
said. The hospital began a contract with the company May 17.</TE>
<TE>   According to its Web site, Healthcare Security Services is based
in Denver and provides services in six states including California.
Company officials could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Glendale Adventist Medical Center was the employer of respiratory
therapist Efren Saldivar, the self-described "Angel of Death," who
was sentenced in April to life in prison without parole for killing
hospital patients.</TE>

<CX>   Arrest statement--A story in Thursday's California section
incorrectly attributed a statement about a guard charged with groping
patients at a Glendale hospital. Sgt. Kirk Palmer of the Glendale
Police Department said a 45-year-old woman told hospital staff June 2
that she was groped by a security guard. Glendale Adventist Medical
Center spokeswoman Alicia Gonzalez did not make that statement.</CX>

<HD>Grand Jury Finds Ways to Improve Joplin</HD>
<DH>Juveniles: Boys home needs full-time special-ed teacher,
weekend nurse but gets high marks overall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's home for delinquent boys needs a weekend nurse and a
full-time special education teacher, according to a grand jury report
released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   With these and a few minor adjustments, however, the report gives
the Joplin Youth Center high marks.</LD>
<LD>   "We liked it very much," said Jenny Rue, an Orange County Grand
Jury member and the report's primary author. "The center is well-run.
We felt that they are really trying to help the kids and doing a good
job at it."</LD>
<TE>   The center, in the hills above Rancho Santa Margarita, is home to
64 boys, ages 14 and 15, in the custody of the Orange County
Probation Department. Besides offering a disciplined guidance
program, the center has a fully accredited high school.</TE>
<TE>   The report recommended having a nurse work weekends, when the boys
engage in sports and could be injured, and a full-time special
education instructor for those with learning disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   The facility already has nurses on site during the week and
part-time special education instructors.</TE>
<TE>   Other suggestions offered by the grand jury included hiring a
clerk to help process student transcripts and scheduling monthly
coordinating meetings between the center's director and various
program specialists.</TE>
<TE>   "It was more of a complimentary report than a negative one," Rue
said. "None of these are major problems, but things that could be
changed."</TE>

<HD>Officer Testifies Suspect Killed His Canine Partner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Oxnard man wanted on a felony warrant pulled a knife on an
arresting officer, fled and then fatally stabbed a police dog that
had been ordered to apprehend him, the officer testified Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Robert Perez told a Ventura County Superior Court judge
that he saw Timothy Knight, 20, move his right hand, which was
holding the knife, in an upward motion after the dog grabbed him.</LD>
<LD>   Perez testified that there was no way his canine partner, Rudy,
could have jumped onto the knife, given the location of the wound.</LD>
<TE>   The 4-year-old Belgian Malinois was stabbed once in the left lower
chest and died after being rushed to a pet emergency clinic after the
April 19 incident. Rudy was the Oxnard Police Department's first dog
to die in the line of duty.</TE>
<TE>   Knight is charged with harming a police dog, resisting arrest,
exhibiting a weapon to a police officer while resisting arrest and
violating his probation on a stolen property case. He is being held
in jail in lieu of $510,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   During a preliminary hearing Wednesday, Knight sat at a counsel
table dressed in a jail uniform, his hands shackled at his waist.</TE>
<TE>   According to court testimony, Knight was wanted on an outstanding
warrant on the evening of April 19 when an Oxnard police officer
attempted to pull him over for allegedly not wearing a seat belt.</TE>
<TE>   Knight ran into a residential neighborhood, and police officers
went door to door looking for him, witnesses testified.</TE>
<TE>   Claudia Reyes, a neighbor who knew the Knight family, testified
that she later agreed to give Knight a ride to a convenience store.</TE>
<TE>   An Oxnard police officer saw Knight getting into the vehicle and
radioed the information to other officers, according to testimony.</TE>
<TE>   When Reyes pulled around a corner in west Oxnard, Perez recognized
the description of the car and pursued it, he testified. When the car
was pulled over, he ordered the man in the back seat to get out.</TE>
<TE>   It was Knight, he testified. The defendant got out on the opposite
side of the car, Perez said, and pulled out a knife.</TE>
<TE>   "I immediately drew my service weapon and took a few steps back,"
Perez testified. "I continually told him to drop the knife."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Knight backed away and then ran toward a residential
neighborhood. Perez ordered Rudy, who was waiting in the police car,
to stop the suspect, the officer testified.</TE>
<TE>   When the dog reached Knight, he said, the defendant turned, still
holding the knife, and Rudy grabbed his right arm.</TE>
<TE>   Perez said he saw Knight move his hand upward, Rudy stumble and
the knife fall to the ground. Knight then began hitting the dog on
the head and Perez tackled the suspect, the officer testified. It
wasn't until later that Perez noticed blood on the ground, realized
the dog had been stabbed and rushed Rudy to a veterinary clinic in
Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Before they left the scene, Perez testified, he heard Knight
taunting: "You should have just shot me."</TE>
<TE>   On cross-examination, Knight's lawyer questioned the police
tactics in apprehending his client.</TE>
<TE>   At the conclusion of Wednesday's hearing, Superior Court Judge
Colleen Toy White found there was sufficient evidence to order Knight
to stand trial on the charges. A trial date is expected to be set
later this month.</TE>

<HD>Judge Orders Evaluation for Molester</HD>
<DH>Law: Prison sentence for Ventura County attorney, who
admitted to lewd conduct with girl, is withheld until a study is
conducted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attorney Robert Silver made an appearance in a Ventura County
courtroom Wednesday afternoon, but not as an officer of the court.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Silver, who has practiced law in the county for 36 years,
was taken into custody and sent to state prison for molesting a girl
three decades ago in his law office and at his Ojai home.</LD>
<LD>   "This man is a criminal," the victim, now 41, testified during an
hourlong sentencing hearing in which she described how Silver, now
67, repeatedly fondled and sexually assaulted her starting when she
was 5.</LD>
<TE>   "I begged him as a child to stop," she told the court. "Put this
man in jail, please."</TE>
<TE>   But Superior Court Judge Bruce Clark declined to impose the
maximum eight-year prison sentence sought by prosecutors Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Clark sent Silver to the California Department of
Corrections for a 90-day psychological evaluation, saying he needed
additional information before handing down a final ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in a sports jacket, brown pants and cowboy boots, Silver,
who has no previous criminal record and is still a practicing
attorney, was handcuffed by deputies and led to a holding cell. His
sister and church pastor watched from the courtroom gallery.</TE>
<TE>   Outside court, the victim, a Redondo Beach resident, sighed and
said the judge's decision was par for the course.</TE>
<TE>   She has spent the last decade trying to bring Silver to justice,
first filing a civil suit against him in Orange County Superior Court
and then seeking criminal charges after state lawmakers changed a law
to allow certain sexual assault cases to be filed after the statute
of limitations has expired.</TE>
<TE>   In court Wednesday, attorneys made reference to the unusual path
that Silver's case has taken.</TE>
<TE>   The civil complaint was filed in 1991 and took nine years to
litigate. Silver, advised by his lawyer that he could not be
prosecuted because the three-year statute of limitations on lewd acts
with a child had run out, admitted in depositions and at trial to
fondling the girl, according to court records. Silver denied, and
still does, that more serious sexual conduct occurred.</TE>
<TE>   An Orange County Superior Court judge ruled that the truth was
probably somewhere in between the testimony offered by Silver and the
victim, but ruled in her favor. She was awarded $450,000, which was
later reduced to $200,000 to be doled out in monthly payments.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, as the civil case was pending, state lawmakers in 1994
enacted a law that under certain circumstances allows sex crimes to
be revived after the statute of limitations has expired.</TE>
<TE>   After that law was challenged as unconstitutional in court,
revisions were made. In 1999, the California Supreme Court upheld the
legislation after ruling that it did not violate constitutional
principles.</TE>
<TE>   When the victim in Silver's case read a newspaper article about
the law, she contacted Ventura police and reported the alleged sexual
abuse by Silver--34 years after it began.</TE>
<TE>   "Be aware, some of us will gain our strength and our identity
back," the victim wrote in a prepared statement this week. "And then
we will hunt you like we were hunted."</TE>
<TE>   In April 2000, Silver was charged with eight counts of lewd acts
on a child and one count of forcible rape. After two years of legal
challenges and delays, he pleaded guilty in April 2002 to five counts
of lewd acts with a child.</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's sentencing hearing, Deputy Dist. Atty. Nancy Ayers
argued that after so many years, it was time for Silver to be
punished for his crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Ayers called it an egregious case and urged Clark to send Silver
to state prison.</TE>
<TE>   But Deputy Public Defender Todd Howeth argued that Silver is not a
danger to the community and should be released on probation.</TE>
<TE>   Howeth said his client is paying restitution through the civil
judgment, probably will lose his license to practice law and will
have to register as a sex offender.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a broken man," Howeth said.</TE>
<TE>   Clark asked the lawyers for more specific information about the
sexual conduct that occurred.</TE>
<TE>   But because there has not been a trial, or even a preliminary
hearing on the matter, the facts remain in dispute. Clark ordered the
90-day study and made no further comment.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll just have to wait and see," Ayers said after the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   As of Wednesday, Silver remained in good standing with the State
Bar of California and could continue to practice law. But bar
association officials in Los Angeles confirmed late Wednesday that
they had received written notice of Silver's convictions and were
planning to forward the material today to an administrative judge,
who was expected to temporarily suspend Silver's law license--by
Friday--until a formal hearing can be held.</TE>
<TE>   Bar spokeswoman Kathleen Beitiks said the suspension would have
occurred closer to Silver's guilty pleas, but it took Ventura County
court officials several weeks to prepare and mail documents.</TE>
<TE>   Following the suspension, bar officials would conduct an
investigation into Silver's case and schedule a hearing to determine
the fate of his bar card. Penalties range from a reprimand to
disbarment.</TE>
<TE>   As he left the courthouse Wednesday, Pastor Lyn Thomas of the
Wesleyan Church in Ojai said that Silver is not the predator
portrayed in court.</TE>
<TE>   Silver momentarily halted Wednesday's court proceedings to consult
with the pastor behind closed doors.</TE>
<TE>   "The man as you see sitting there in the courtroom," Thomas said,
"is truly a different man from 20 or 25 years ago."</TE>

<HD>Special School for Immigrants to Close</HD>
<DH>Education: Decision reflects costs, shift in philosophy.
Backers call campus an oasis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bellagio Road Newcomer Center, a leafy Bel-Air refuge for
children who recently immigrated to Los Angeles, will close at the
end of this month, a casualty of budget cuts and changing ideas about
educating youngsters from other countries.</LD>
<LD>   Emphasizing intensive language instruction and social
acculturation, Bellagio is among only a few such schools across the
nation, including facilities in Sacramento, San Francisco and New
York City.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Board of Education voted 4 to 2 to close the
12-year-old Bellagio program last month, citing declining enrollment
and inefficiencies at the 390-student campus. Bus transportation
alone cost the district $550,000 a year. And district leaders such as
school board member Marlene Canter, who represents the area, say the
facility would be better used as a charter school to lure
middle-class families away from private schools.</LD>
<TE>   Bellagio's demise represents a philosophical shift within the Los
Angeles Unified School District since voters' approval in 1998 of the
anti-bilingual education measure, Proposition 227. Some district
officials say immigrant children should be educated at their
neighborhood schools rather than at special centers--echoing
decentralization trends like the mainstreaming of special education
students. They also contend that Bellagio coddles immigrant students
by failing to follow district standards on reading and testing.</TE>
<TE>   But the campus' supporters say it has been a rare oasis for new
immigrants in a large and bewildering school district that often
fails even native-born English speakers. They say Bellagio has
provided immigrant students with knowledgeable teachers sensitive to
their needs.</TE>
<TE>   Even critics of the newcomer center agree that the district must
do a better job at educating Los Angeles' immigrant student
population. About 10,000 such students enroll at L.A. Unified schools
each year, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   'Not Enough Services'</TE>
<TE>   "There are not enough services out there for these kids," said
Rita Caldera, supervisor of bilingual and immigrant education
programs throughout the overcrowded district. "One psychologist and
one social worker is not enough in a school of 2,000 or 3,000
children."</TE>
<TE>   Some of Bellagio's students had never been inside a classroom
before arriving in Los Angeles. An ongoing joint study by L.A.
Unified and the Rand Corp. think tank has found that one-third of all
new immigrant children in the district were exposed to violence in
their home countries before immigrating and show symptoms of
post-traumatic stress syndrome. That figure does not include a
significant number traumatized during their trek to America,
researchers say.</TE>
<TE>   Every morning school buses ferry children from hardscrabble
downtown neighborhoods, past massive estates adorned with
bougainvillea vines and copper gates, to Bellagio. Set against the
Santa Monica Mountains, Bellagio is a complex of buildings with
shaded walkways and lavender bushes planted by a band of Bel-Air
volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Few Discipline Issues</TE>
<TE>   Teachers say there are few discipline problems, although there
have been occasional spats between Latino and Korean students, the
two largest ethnic groups at the school. Two-thirds of Bellagio's
students come from Latin America, and 18% come from Korea. Most of
the rest are from China, Armenia or Africa. Bellagio's students range
from third to eighth grade and are supposed to stay no more than one
year, though nearly 30% remain longer.</TE>
<TE>   Williams Bonilla, 15, has been at Bellagio for more than two
years. He made a one-year trek alone to California from Honduras,
leaving behind his mother and their cardboard shanty. The journey
took so long because he walked and hitched rides on trains most of
the way. Occasionally he stopped in a town to work and make some
money.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I didn't eat nothing," he said. After living on the
street for several months in Los Angeles, he was adopted by a local
family who enrolled him at Bellagio, the first school he had ever
attended.</TE>
<TE>   Now he reads motorcycle magazines and speaks halting English.</TE>
<TE>   'I Came Here to Work'</TE>
<TE>   "I came here to work and get money for my family," he said. "But
now I want to stay in school so I can be something in life."</TE>
<TE>   Bellagio was the state of the art in immigrant education when the
program opened in 1989. The former elementary campus had been unused
for years, because most of the neighborhood families sent their
children to private schools.</TE>
<TE>   "The intent was to have several schools like Bellagio all over the
city," said Rose Marie Durocher, who formerly headed the Immigrant
Student Assessment and Placement Center at Plasencia Elementary
School northwest of downtown. From thousands of immigrant youngsters,
that center referred to Bellagio only those who had extreme
difficulty with English, were illiterate or had emotional problems
related to circumstances in their native countries.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Durocher said, the philosophy is "these children need to be
assimilated immediately."</TE>
<TE>   Dianne Nezgoda adopted her 11-year-old daughter, Eugenia, in
Russia almost two years ago and first enrolled her at Warner Avenue
Elementary, their neighborhood school in Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   "They placed her in fourth grade because that was
age-appropriate," said Nezgoda. "But she was so frustrated--while she
was learning her ABCs, the other kids were learning about the
respiratory and circulatory system. She'd come home crying every
night." Eugenia moved to Bellagio and now reads at grade level.</TE>
<TE>   She will be ready next fall when she re-enrolls at Warner, Nezgoda
said, "but it has taken time."</TE>
<TE>   One-Year Limit</TE>
<TE>   Richard Alonzo, superintendent of the subdistrict that includes
Bellagio, said that the school retained too many students past the
one-year limit and that he feared the practice could breach civil
rights regulations. The only other newcomer school in L.A. Unified is
attached to Belmont High School and avoided such intense criticism,
say district officials, because it is less segregated than Bellagio
and moves students of high school age into regular school programs
more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Alonzo also said Bellagio has failed to attract enough new
students and to consistently test them. Supt. Roy Romer complained to
the school board that Bellagio has not used the district's preferred
reading program--Open Court.</TE>
<TE>   But Bellagio staff members said their enrollment has fallen
because the Plasencia immigrant assessment office stopped referring
as many students last year, when the district cut staff at that
center. Jim Sanchez, a counselor at the center, said Alonzo's office
ordered him to refer immigrant students to neighborhood schools until
those filled to capacity and to regard Bellagio as a last resort.</TE>
<TE>   Alonzo denied that students were kept from Bellagio and insisted
that most parents chose neighborhood schools on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Rochelle Farkas, a counselor at Bellagio, said any students who
stay more than a year either enrolled late in the first year or were
unprepared for regular schools because of emotional or academic
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Bellagio teachers said they have tested nearly every student who
was eligible, although some received parental permission, as is their
right by law, to opt out of standardized tests in English. Those who
took Spanish-language assessment tests scored at or above the
district average, according to teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a group of vocal Westside parents has recently proposed
to rent 12 classrooms at Bellagio from the district for $250,000 a
year to house their New West Charter Middle School. Other portions of
the campus may be devoted to teacher training.</TE>
<TE>   Canter said her support for that charter plan had nothing to do
with the closing of the newcomer school.</TE>
<TE>   "I think charter schools are an opportunity for a large
bureaucracy like ours to bring in new ideas," she said. "And they're
a way to keep families in L.A. Unified."</TE>
<TE>   But some Bellagio supporters don't believe Canter's contention.</TE>
<TE>   'A Bunch of Baloney'</TE>
<TE>   "That's a bunch of baloney," said Stacy Price, a bilingual
coordinator at Bellagio who believes that the program is being
shuttered to make way for the charter school.</TE>
<TE>   School board member Julie Korenstein, who voted against Bellagio's
closure, also said she suspects a link. "I think it's terrible to
close it down for children coming in from nations all over the world
attempting to assimilate into American culture, and use it instead
for a charter school," she said.</TE>

<HD>Web Used in Fight Over Nuclear Waste Disposal</HD>
<DH>Safety: Internet users see how close they live to highways
and rail lines proposed for transit of material to Nevada site.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 7.5 million Californians live within one mile of major rail
lines and highways that could be used to transport radioactive waste
to Yucca Mountain in Nevada, the proposed repository for high-level
nuclear waste, according to the Environmental Working Group.</LD>
<LD>   The nonprofit group, based in Washington, D.C., and Oakland, has
created a Web site that allows users to type in their home address or
any other U.S. location to find out how close they are to proposed
transport routes to Yucca Mountain.</LD>
<LD>   Staff members of the nonprofit organization said they used maps
contained in a Department of Energy environmental impact statement on
shipping nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain, enlarged them and combined
them with local school maps, census and transportation safety data to
create www.mapscience.org.</LD>
<TE>   "What we're trying to do," said Bill Walker, vice president of the
group in Oakland, "is make it easy for the individual person to see
just how close a proposed nuclear waste route is through their
neighborhood, including locations of schools and hospitals."</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the group said they were not taking a position
on the Bush administration's widely contested plan to store the waste
at Yucca Mountain, 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas. But they said
they had worked with and received funding from opponents of the
proposed site.</TE>
<TE>   "All we're trying to say is that we don't believe the American
public has been offered the kind of information to participate fully
in this decision," said Walker.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Davis, a spokesman for the Department of Energy, said that
although preliminary route maps had been prepared, the routes could
change by 2010, when the facility is scheduled to open.</TE>
<TE>   "These are routes based on current regulations," said Davis. "Some
of them may be used, some of them may not."</TE>
<TE>   But the working group's senior vice president, Richard Wiles, said
the safest routes for transporting an estimated 77,000 tons of waste
from 131 nuclear reactors throughout the country will be railroad
lines and interstate highways, which go through and near major
population centers.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming out of most these reactors, you have to get out onto a
main interstate or main rail line as soon as you can," said Wiles.
"They may want to take the 5 instead of the 405 leaving San Onofre or
Diablo [the two active nuclear reactor sites in Southern California]
but basically they'll have to go through Los Angeles and the Inland
Empire on the interstates. There's no other way to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Kerekes, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, which
represents the owners/ operators of nuclear plants, said: "We have a
35-year sterling track record" of safely transporting nuclear waste,
and that would not change if Yucca Mountain becomes the final
destination. He said the Department of Energy had stated "quite
explicitly" that rail transport would be preferred over highways.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said that the Web site would be of no use to terrorists
because no final routes have been determined, and specific shipment
information will be classified.</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit group said it just wants to increase public
discussion before a final Senate vote on the designation of the site,
which could come as soon as June 25. The House voted last month to
rebuff an attempt by Nevada officials to block the plan.</TE>
<TE>   The Environmental Working Group received funding from the Las
Vegas Sun newspaper's publisher, who has been an outspoken critic of
the plan, as well as from the Turner Foundation and others, according
to the group.</TE>
<TE>   The organization is perhaps best known for a Web site it created
to inform the public of federal farm subsidy recipients.</TE>
<TE>   A group spokesman said that since the nuclear waste Web site
debuted Tuesday, 35,000 users had visited and 50,000 maps had been
generated.</TE>

<LD>A federal judge said Wednesday he will not block an $88.9-million
inheritance award to former Playboy Playmate Anna Nicole Smith unless
the son of her late husband posts a bond for half that amount.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Court Judge David Owen Carter in Santa Ana said E.
Pierce Marshall would have to guarantee some payment to Smith if he

<LD>   Pierce Marshall has bitterly contested any award from the estate

<LD>A woman who moved into a new housing tract in Paramount called the
city with an unusual complaint. The local pizza shops will not
deliver to her address because it doesn't yet appear in the Thomas
Guide map book.</LD>
<LD>   "I demand pizza now!" the woman said. "I pay taxes, and my
children and I deserve pizza."</LD>
<LD>   Well, there's always the frozen variety ... but beware the
complicated instructions. Howard Cohen of North Hills bought one
brand of frozen pizza that carried the warning: "Cook before eating."</LD>
<TE>   No second helpings here! UCLA hosted a Digestive Diseases Luncheon

<TE>   It was a hair-styling shop. The name was familiar but not the

<HD>Oracle E-Mail Urged Big Donations</HD>
<DH>Probe: Lobbyist wrote that gifts to lawmakers would
solidify deal. Firm says it ignored his advice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN and CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Oracle lobbyist Ravi Mehta outlined for his bosses a detailed plan
for contributing money to legislators as a way of solidifying the
company's $95-million software contract with the state, including a
recommendation that Oracle help fund a college project of a key state
senator's son, according to an e-mail released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Mehta sent the e-mail on Jan. 5, at a time when state auditors
were preparing what turned out to be a highly critical review of the
contract between the state and Oracle Corp. and its partner, Northrop
Grumman subsidiary Logicon.</LD>
<LD>   Oracle released the e-mail and other documents to the Joint
Legislative Audit Committee, which is examining the deal struck in
May 2001 without competitive bids.</LD>
<TE>   Oracle executives said Wednesday that Mehta resigned at the
company's request on May 31, and they distanced themselves from both
Mehta and the memo he drafted. Although the company paid Mehta at
least $8,000 a month, including a $25,000 bonus after the state
entered the software deal with Oracle, Kenneth Glueck, head of
Oracle's governmental affairs, said the company followed none of
Mehta's January suggestions related to campaign donations.</TE>
<TE>   In the memo, Mehta urged that Oracle governmental affairs
executive Robert Hoffman expedite the contributions, noting "early
support [goes] a lot farther than coming in when we need something."
Mehta suggested making donations of between $1,000 and $10,000 to
eight lawmakers and candidates, including Assembly Speaker Herb
Wesson (D-Culver City).</TE>
<TE>   Mehta's most unusual suggestion involved the son of Sen. Steve
Peace (D-El Cajon), a member of the Joint Legislative Audit
Committee. Peace has been among Oracle's harshest critics, going so
far as to label one of Oracle's executives as "either stupid or
corrupt."</TE>
<TE>   The memo noted that Peace had been "extremely critical" of how the
agreement was struck and had opined that the Northrop Grumman
subsidiary could have engaged in illegal acts. Mehta then noted that
Peace's chief of staff, Dan Howle, called him in October saying that
Bret Peace, a student at Stanford University, "is working on a
project and looking for corporate sponsorship," and wondered whether
Oracle would consider donating money to the project.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe Oracle should seriously consider making a contribution
directly to Stanford and earmark it for this project," Mehta wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Howle, who since has left Peace's office,
acknowledged calling Mehta and several other representatives of
high-tech firms seeking money to help finance young Peace's project,
a magazine. He dropped it when Bret Peace called back to say that the
university did not want him to pursue outside funding, Howle said.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't turn out to be anything; he pulled the plug," said
Howle, whose sister, state auditor Elaine Howle, wrote the report
that led to investigations of the Oracle deal by the Legislature and
Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer and prompted an inquiry by the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Peace, asked whether the call by his former aide was
appropriate, said: "I would rather he had not done so."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a typical Ravi thing," Peace said. "He's got a problem with
somebody. He thinks he is going to solve it with a campaign
contribution. That's why Ravi is in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Bret Peace told The Times that Oracle was one of several companies
considered as possible donors for a project he and other students
were contemplating. "This idea was never followed through with, and
no funds were solicited from any companies."</TE>
<TE>   Among others mentioned in the memo, Mehta predicted that Wesson
"will be very helpful to Oracle." Noting that he was scheduled to
have dinner with Wesson in January, Mehta was seeking $10,000 for the
speaker, and another $10,000 for Assemblyman Marco Firebaugh (D-Los
Angeles).</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Mehta sought money for Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza
(D-Long Beach), noting that she would chair the Assembly Budget
Committee, which would have oversight of the Oracle deal. Oracle
"will need her to ensure" that the contract remains in place, he
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Mehta also sought money for key Republicans, Assembly Budget
Committee Vice Chairman John Campbell of Irvine and Assembly
Republican Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks, who "was helpful to us
during the audit debate."</TE>
<TE>   Mehta had been scheduled to testify before the Joint Legislative
Audit Committee on Wednesday. But his attorney, Matthew Jacobs, sent
a letter to the committee saying Mehta would not appear, prompting
Chairman Dean Florez (D-Shafter) to obtain a subpoena. Jacobs' letter
suggests that even if Mehta is forced to appear, he will invoke his
constitutional right against incriminating himself.</TE>
<TE>   Mehta became a Capitol lobbyist after serving as then-Gov. Pete
Wilson's chairman of the Fair Political Practices Commission, the
government agency most responsible for enforcing regulations
governing campaign donations and lobbying.</TE>
<TE>   He has been a key figure in the investigation into the contract.
Last June, he handed a $25,000 campaign donation to Arun Baheti, Gov.
Gray Davis' director of high-tech affairs, shortly after the deal had
been struck. Davis forced Baheti to quit after Baheti acknowledged
accepting the check in violation of Davis' policy against mixing
politics and policy matters.</TE>
<TE>   At roughly the same time that Mehta sent the memo to Oracle
executives, the company was retaining Kurt Sjoberg, the former state
auditor, to prepare a report defending the deal. Florez, the
investigating committee chairman, said the memo, coupled with
Sjoberg's hiring, suggests that Oracle was "ramping it up" to defend
against the coming criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle executives disputed that assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically he made these suggestions and they were all rejected,"
Oracle's Glueck said of Mehta, adding that Mehta made many
recommendations during the three years he did work for the firm. "We
followed very, very few of them."</TE>
<TE>   Glueck called the memo "in very poor taste," and said it does not
reflect on how Oracle conducts its business and lobbying.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time that you commingle business and political contributions,
it's something that sends up red flags in my head," Glueck said. "The
guy who was head of FPPC should know better."</TE>
<TE>   Mehta was forced to resign as chairman of the Fair Political
Practices Commission in 1997 after he criticized Proposition 208, a
measure approved by voters that sought to restrict campaign donations
and that the commission was supposed to enforce. Later, the FPPC
fined Mehta for diverting $7,000 from a campaign committee set up to
support then-Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren in his run for governor in 1998.
Mehta used the money to paint his Porsche sports car.</TE>

<HD>Teen's Attendance Is One for the Books</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jessica Andrade blames her sister for her imperfect attendance
record.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Ana girl caught chicken pox from her in preschool,
forcing her to take a week off and start her race for perfect
attendance in kindergarten.</LD>
<LD>   But for the next 13 years, through softball tournaments and tennis
matches, calculus workshops and 24-hour bugs, Jessica never missed a
day of school.</LD>
<TE>   The 17-year-old will receive an award for this accomplishment when
she takes her degree today from Century High School in Santa Ana,
where she was a star athlete and earned a 4.0 grade-point average.
Three other Orange County students also will finish with a perfect
attendance record from kindergarten through high school. Jessica
credits her parents--Santiago, 48, and Lourdes, 41--for raising her
as a responsible child involved in many activities. They started her
softball career at a local park when she was 6 and encouraged her to
start playing tennis as a freshman.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not only an award for me, it's for my parents," Jessica
said. "A lot of parents are really indulgent, letting their kids stay
home just because they don't feel like going to school. Mine kept me
focused on the day-to-day stuff and my future."</TE>
<TE>   Her sister, Erica, a 19-year-old Cal State Long Beach student,
almost had perfect attendance but for that bout of chicken pox and an
excused absence for junior high cheerleading camp.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica started making a concerted effort to reach 13 years of
perfect attendance after fifth grade.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes when I felt sick, I was really dragging," Jessica said.
"Once I just slept through all my classes. But I was there."</TE>
<TE>   Named the tennis team's most valuable player all four years,
Jessica also played softball--every position but first base--and was
involved in the school's math club.</TE>
<TE>   In the fall, Jessica will study at UC Irvine, where she will major
in math. She hopes to become a math teacher at a local
school--ideally, her alma mater.</TE>
<TE>   She had planned to attend Cal State Fullerton until the beginning
of her senior year, when Century math teacher Bill Snyder encouraged
her to consider a UC school.</TE>
<TE>   Snyder, also Jessica's softball coach and senior advisor, said,
"She would do everything you asked her to do, and she would do it
well. Even more than the perfect attendance, it's that whole attitude
that impresses me most."</TE>
<TE>   Glittering paper cutouts of butterflies cover the door to
Jessica's bedroom, where candles fill the shelves and
butterfly-strewn netting floats over her bed.</TE>
<TE>   Pictures of her boyfriend, whom she has been dating for 14 months,
crowd one cork board. She said the boy had a ditching habit before
they started going out.</TE>
<TE>   But after the couple starting dating, he came to school every day
to be with her, even on Senior Ditch Day, when they were two of the
four seniors in class.</TE>
<TE>   Her father said Jessica pushed herself to go to school each day,
even when he and his wife, a data processor, asked her to take a day
off after grueling weekend tennis tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   "We told her to get some rest, but she wouldn't consider staying
home," said Santiago Andrade, a janitor. "Being responsible--that's
just the way she is."</TE>

<HD>2 More Join Claim Over Alleged Abuse by Teacher</HD>
<DH>Oxnard district: Amended filing alleges another Camarillo
High instructor discussed the case in class, worried it might cost
her a raise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two more teenage boys have joined a multimillion-dollar claim
alleging that school officials initially ignored complaints brought
against a Camarillo High School science teacher accused of molesting
several students.</LD>
<LD>   Six boys and their families are now seeking up to $46 million in
damages from the Oxnard Union High School District, Camarillo High
School and several individual employees.</LD>
<LD>   School district officials could not be reached for comment late
Wednesday after Carol Woo, the district's attorney, reported the
latest development in the case.</LD>
<TE>   The original claim, filed by Ventura attorney Brenda Andrade on
June 5, alleges that officials--from an athletic director to top
district administrators--were warned on several occasions, as early
as 1999, of inappropriate behavior by 30-year-old teacher Chad
Pridgen and failed to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   It further accuses district officials of conspiring to conceal
evidence that might have helped the alleged victims' case, including
destroying documents and withholding information.</TE>
<TE>   The amended claim includes new allegations that school employees
are continuing to harass the alleged victims by discussing the claim
in class. Just last week,the claim says, a math teacher told her
students that she disapproved of the legal action because it could
take money away from the school and hurt her chances of getting a pay
raise next year.</TE>
<TE>   According to the claim, other students began chiming in, not
realizing that one of the alleged victims was in the class. He felt
humiliated and insulted and wanted to leave, but feared that would
reveal his identity as one of the boys accusing Pridgen of sex
crimes, the claim said.</TE>
<TE>   In bringing up the issue in class, the teacher "sought to enrage
the students against the suit contemplated by plaintiffs and dissuade
potential victims from reporting misconduct," the claim alleges.</TE>
<TE>   The teacher declined to comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Attached to the claim filed June 5 is a transcript of
investigators' interview with Rachel Hornbek, a junior varsity girls
soccer coach who worked with Pridgen at the high school.</TE>
<TE>   In the interview, she said several players on her team who were
acquainted with boys on Pridgen's team told her that Pridgen gave
students alcohol at his house parties and had a "regular habit of
describing his sexual exploits the night before to them."</TE>
<TE>   According to the claim, Hornbek relayed her concerns about
Pridgen--which also included his tendency to leave the team
practicing unsupervised--to Athletic Director Mike Smith.</TE>
<TE>   In October, three months before Pridgen was arrested, she wrote a
letter to Camarillo High Principal Sylvia Jackson detailing her
concerns. The letter, a copy of which was included in the claim, said
Hornbek had heard "reports that Pridgen shared sexually explicit
stories from his personal life" with students.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County prosecutors have charged Pridgen with 39 felony and
misdemeanor counts involving 11 teenage boys, all but two of whom are
current or former Camarillo High students.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's investigators say Pridgen used his authority as a
teacher to coerce students into performing sex acts for him, from
masturbation to oral sex. Court documents allege that from the spring
of 2000 until January 2002 the teacher had students come to his
Camarillo home almost every weekend for parties that included
alcohol, pornography and sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen, who taught upper-level science courses and coached soccer
and tennis at the school for six years, has been on unpaid leave
since his Feb. 5 arrest. He is free on $500,000 bail, and a
preliminary hearing is set for July 23.</TE>

<LD>The Wolf fire in Los Padres National Forest near Ojai was 85%
contained late Wednesday, and fire officials were anticipating total
containment by early Friday evening.</LD>
<LD>   For a third consecutive day Wednesday, firefighters held the blaze
to 21,278 acres while a fleet of helicopters dropped loads of water
and fire retardant, said Joe Pasinato, a U.S. Forest Service
spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   More than 1,200 firefighters were fighting the fire, but officials
were gradually releasing personnel, many of whom will be reassigned
to major fires in Colorado.</LD>
<TE>   Since the Wolf Fire started June 1, the cost of fighting it has
reached $13.2 million.</TE>

<HD>Jury Demands Priests' Records</HD>
<DH>Courts: Grand jurors issue subpoenas for personnel files of
three clerics accused of abuse. Their attorney seeks to have the
action voided.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON and LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A grand jury issued subpoenas Wednesday to the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Los Angeles to force it to hand over the personnel
records of three priests under criminal investigation for alleged
sexual abuse of minors.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley turned to the grand jury to
obtain the personnel files after a lawyer for the priests objected
two weeks ago to the release of the documents. Cooley's office
declined to comment, but two sources familiar with the process said
the grand jury had acted.</LD>
<LD>   The subpoenas escalated pressure on Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, who
was in Dallas as the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops prepared to
convene for the first time since the church was rocked by the sexual
abuse scandal. Mahony's handling of two of the priests named in the
subpoenas has been a point of controversy.</LD>
<TE>   Michael Hennigan, a Los Angeles attorney representing the
archdiocese in the cases, said he had received subpoenas from the Los
Angeles County Grand Jury for documents related to Father Michael
Stephen Baker, who is retired; Father Michael Wempe; and Father David
Granadino.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said the archdiocese would comply with the subpoenas. But a
lawyer who represents the individual priests said he will ask a judge
to stop the documents from being handed over, contending that it
would violate state and federal privacy laws.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had the files waiting," Mahony said. "What we've been
reminding people is these priests all have attorneys, so it isn't our
decision. The district attorney and their attorneys have to work this
out. There are a number of ways to do it, and a subpoena is fine."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said the files contain psychological evaluations, so it is
no surprise that the priests' lawyers would object.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony transferred Baker to several parishes after the priest told
him in 1986 that he had molested young boys. The cardinal later
approved a secret $1.3-million settlement to two men allegedly abused
by Baker in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal has said he erred when he transferred Wempe, who is
accused of molesting children, to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center about
14 years ago without telling hospital officials.</TE>
<TE>   Wempe was among eight priests Mahony forced to retire earlier this
year after the archdiocese adopted a "zero tolerance" policy for
abusers in the wake of a lawsuit settlement. Since then the
archdiocese has placed a handful of other priests on leave because of
allegations. One of them is Granadino, a priest at St. Francis of
Rome church in Azusa and the subject of a county Sheriff's Department
probe into accusations that he molested boys in Norwalk and Azusa.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said he expects the documents to be handed over next week,
barring objections. "We want these cases dealt with and justice done
one way or the other to get it over with.... The one thing that does
not help us is just to have this thing month after month after
month."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter last month, Cooley threatened Mahony with a grand jury
investigation unless the cardinal gave law enforcement agencies all
documents related to the priests under criminal investigation for
alleged abuse. The archdiocese agreed to turn over the documents. But
prosecutors suspended a May 30 deadline because of the legal
objections made by Donald Steier, the priests' attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Steier said Wednesday that he will file a motion to quash the
subpoenas and ask a judge to hold a closed review of the files to
hear his objections.</TE>
<TE>   Steier noted that in a 1995 molestation case involving Ted Llanos,
a Long Beach priest who has since died, he succeeded in having a
subpoena for documents quashed. He compared his philosophy to that of
"individual police officers [who] assert similar objections when
their personnel files are sought in litigation."</TE>

<HD>Defense Says Girl Coerced to Make Sex Charges Against Coach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the first day of the trial of a high school basketball coach
accused of having sex with a Glendale girl on his team, the coach's
attorney argued Wednesday that two other faculty members had coerced
the student into making false accusations.</LD>
<LD>   The defense lawyer contended that two female coaches resented Paul
Calvin Clark III's promotion to athletic director at Ribet Academy,
the Los Angeles private school where they all worked. So they pressed
the high school freshman into falsely saying that she and Clark were
having sex, the attorney argued.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the prosecution presented a former student from a
different school where Clark had previously worked who testified that
she had a relationship with him when she was underage.</LD>
<TE>   Clark, 34, of Duarte faces felony charges carrying up to 16 years
in prison for various alleged sex acts in 2001 with a minor
identified as "Jessica V.," a member of the girls' basketball team at
Ribet. Clark no longer works at the school, which is in the Glassell
Park neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   In his opening statement Wednesday in a Pasadena courtroom,
Clark's attorney, Robert M. Bernstein, told the jury of nine men and
three women that the two female coaches surreptitiously videotaped
Jessica while pressuring her into admitting a sexual relationship
with Clark. Bernstein plans to show jurors that tape.</TE>
<TE>   "This case is merely about sex, lies and videotape," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrea Austin said in her
opening statement that even though Clark's relationship with Jessica
was consensual, he still committed statutory rape by having sex with
her while he was 33 and she was 15.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a case about a betrayal of trust," Austin said.</TE>
<TE>   For her first witness, Austin put on the stand Robyn Hayes, who
played on Clark's basketball team at Immaculate Conception School in
Monrovia seven years ago. Hayes, now 21, testified that she and Clark
began having consensual sex when she was 14. She said she denied the
relationship to others until last year, when a Los Angeles County
sheriff's detective asked her about it during his investigation of
Jessica V.'s allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Before Hayes took the stand, Bernstein attacked her credibility,
telling jurors that she is "an accomplished liar" who had a sexual
relationship with Clark only as an adult.</TE>
<TE>   Clark and Jessica V. are alleged to have had sex multiple times in
the first six months of 2001--in his office at Ribet Academy and in a
locker room there, at his home and in his car.</TE>
<TE>   Their final encounter allegedly occurred in early July 2001, when
Jessica's parents discovered her missing from her bedroom in their
Glendale home. Her father testified Wednesday that he called Clark
that night to ask about Jessica's whereabouts because the girl's
cousin, who was sleeping over, told him that Jessica had telephoned
her coach before leaving the house.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica V. is expected to testify today.</TE>

<LD>To the delight of anti-secessionists, the leaders of San Fernando
Valley's largest business group Wednesday postponed its expected
launch of a campaign supporting a split from Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Delegates for the San Fernando Valley United Chambers of Commerce
said they need more time to study the secession measure on the Nov. 5
ballot. They voted 17-16 to delay taking a formal stand on secession
until their meeting in July.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, the group's governmental affairs committee recommended
that the chambers support a municipal divorce.</LD>
<TE>   "It's troubling to me," said Williams Powers Jr., chairman of the
group, which includes 25 chambers and a professional organization.</TE>
<TE>   He is also an executive board member for Valley VOTE, which is
spearheading the breakaway movement.</TE>
<TE>   Powers chastised chamber representatives who said they needed to
poll members and pore over a state commission's report on secession,
which was released last month.</TE>
<TE>   The chambers have had ample time to make an informed decision on
secession, Powers said.</TE>
<TE>   "I would encourage all of you to take action," Powers said.</TE>
<TE>   He predicted the group will decide next month to support
secession.</TE>
<TE>   Kam Kuwata, Mayor James K. Hahn's political strategist, said the
hesitancy of the chamber leaders showed how little people know about
secession. "There's also the uncertainty and possible risk," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce announced its
opposition to secession movements in the Valley and Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hahn on Wednesday praised the decision of Van Nuys
Homeowners Assn. President Don Schultz, a former Valley VOTE member,
to oppose secession. Hahn called Schultz's action a sign that support
for the breakup is crumbling.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's fight against secession also picked up the support of
the Los Angeles County Democratic Central Committee, which voted
unanimously Tuesday night to oppose a breakup.</TE>
<TE>   "While we acknowledge there are problems, most acutely felt by
residents of Valley, we felt the best solution is for us all to roll
up our sleeves and work to make the city better rather than break it
up piece by piece," said committee Chairman Eric Bauman.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, the board of the Police Protective League, the
labor union for Los Angeles police officers, held a closed-door
meeting on secession and a source said afterward that the
organization will soon announce its opposition.</TE>

<HD>O.C. to Pay Family in Inmate Death</HD>
<DH>Courts: Supervisors will settle the jail brutality suit for
$650,000, a county record. Money goes to victim's two kids.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the largest jail brutality settlement ever in Orange County, the
Board of Supervisors voted Wednesday to pay $650,000 to the family of
an inmate who died from head injuries allegedly inflicted by
sheriff's deputies.</LD>
<LD>   Gilbert Garcia's two surviving children contend in a civil rights
lawsuit that deputies beat their father shortly after he was booked
into the county's Intake Release Center in Santa Ana on May 30, 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Thirty minutes after the inmate's arrival, a jail nurse checked
Garcia's cell and noticed him vomiting what appeared to be blood.
Garcia was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died two days later.</LD>
<TE>   Coroner's officials said he died of internal bleeding caused by a
fractured skull.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies have denied any role in Garcia's death and point to a
district attorney's investigation that concluded Garcia suffered his
head injury before he was admitted to the jail.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, supervisors voted 4 to 1 in closed session to
approve the settlement. The dissenting vote was cast by Todd Spitzer,
who declined to comment until the agreement is finalized by a judge
in the next few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The family's attorneys said Garcia's children, ages 12 and 6, will
receive nearly $300,000 as part of the settlement. The rest of the
award will pay their attorneys' fees.</TE>
<TE>   The highest previous settlement for a brutality case in the jail
system was for $100,000. That case involved a 43-year-old inmate who
died in 1995 after fighting with deputies. From 1991 to 2000, the
county paid out a total of $445,000 in injury claims filed on behalf
of inmates.</TE>
<TE>   While the civil case is now closed, Garcia's death continues to
draw scrutiny from federal authorities. Last year, the FBI launched a
probe of Garcia's death to determine whether deputies violated his
civil rights. The case is one of five similar probes into claims of
brutality by deputies in the Orange County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Garcia's family criticized how the Sheriff's
Department and the district attorney's office conducted their
investigation and called on officials to refer the case to the grand
jury for a more independent review.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the worst cases I've ever seen in terms of how strong
the evidence was and the nature of the injuries," civil rights
attorney R. Samuel Paz said.</TE>
<TE>   But Garden Grove police, who originally arrested Garcia, said they
reviewed the case and believe he was injured before entering jail.</TE>
<TE>   "We were convinced that his trauma did not occur while he was in
custody," Sgt. Mike Handfield said. "It's still an open, unsolved
homicide case."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia was arrested by three Garden Grove police officers after he
was seen banging on the sliding glass window of a stranger's
apartment. Garcia smelled of alcohol, according to police reports.</TE>
<TE>   The officers noted in reports that Garcia did not appear to have
any injuries, and witnesses said police treated him well. Police
discovered that an arrest warrant had been issued for him for drunk
driving, so one of the officers drove him to the county jail.</TE>
<TE>   A jail nurse examined Garcia and also noted that he had no obvious
bruises, investigative reports show.</TE>
<TE>   But Garcia appeared very drunk, slurring as he spoke, so deputies
escorted him to a cell to sober up.</TE>
<TE>   Grainy jailhouse surveillance footage shows Garcia on the floor of
his cell with deputies inside removing his shoes. The inmate's family
says it was then that deputies beat him.</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy found that along with his fractured skull, three of
Garcia's ribs were broken. His chest, arms and face were badly
bruised and cut. The doctor who conducted the autopsy told
investigators that some of the bruises were days old.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials declined to comment until the settlement is
final.</TE>

<HD>Pasadena's Secret Garden Delights Visitors</HD>
<DH>Closed since 1997, the 34-acre campus is still impeccably
groomed. A housing development plan is in the works.</DH>

<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A half block from the intersection of Colorado and Orange Grove
boulevards, the launching point of the Rose Parade, is Pasadena's
secret garden: the sprawling grounds of the former Ambassador College
campus.</LD>
<LD>   Hidden behind a row of stately old homes and condos along Orange
Grove Boulevard, the elaborate gardens and the 100-year-old mansions
catch visitors by surprise:</LD>
<LD>   Enter off West Green Street, and fragrant, drooping branches of
giant deodar cedars mingle with the outstretched arms of century-old
native oaks. The reflecting pool and towering Egret Fountain of the
Ambassador Auditorium rise on the east. The "great lawn" spans nine
acres, bisected by a rock-lined stream that tumbles into koi ponds
and a garden pool. An enormous Moreton Bay fig tree stands like a
green mountain near the middle.</LD>
<TE>   A Mediterranean villa sits atop the western slope, next to an
English Tudor and an Italian renaissance mansion, which was once home
to one of Pasadena's most celebrated millionaires.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea this was here or what it was," said Gloria
Cabrales, 52, of South Pasadena, who discovered the gardens two years
ago. "I keep coming back--the water, the trees, the peacefulness. I
enjoy it so much. But is this supposed to be a college? Where are the
students? There is never anyone here."</TE>
<TE>   The almost complete absence of people on the 34-acre grounds,
which is owned by the Worldwide Church of God, has created a
mysterious air on the campus since it closed in 1990. Although the
place is all but deserted, the gardens remain impeccably groomed,
with running fountains and streams. Shrubs are trimmed. Empty
sidewalks are lined with scented star jasmine. Empty benches under
giant shade trees are kept clean. Lawns are edged, and the thick
grass is devoid of footprints.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials say preserving their gardens and campus mansions
has been a 55-year-old "labor of love" that since the mid-90s has
cost about $2 million a year to maintain. Grounds Manager Ron
Grassman, who has a degree in agriculture from Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo, was attracted to the gardens 30 years ago, when he saw the
stone-lined streams in church literature.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea they were man-made until I got here," he said.
Grassman is in charge of a strict pruning, mowing, irrigation and
fertilizing regimen. No mildew on his crepe myrtle watch. A tightly
pruned Japanese boxwood is the key to a precisely terraced garden. A
little blue dye in pond water keeps the algae away.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all so beautiful; it just makes you wonder what it was like
to live here back then," said a 24-year-old Monrovia woman, on a
Sunday morning stroll with her parents.</TE>
<TE>   On a balmy day, when running water and bird songs are the only
sounds, it's hard to believe the future of this paradise is so
uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   The property has been the subject of debate in Pasadena for nearly
three years. A housing project of 1,700 units over 48 acres was
working its way through City Hall when developer Legacy Partners
abandoned its effort in April amid delays and community opposition.
Legacy had agreed in 1999 to buy the entire campus after the city
approved its plan.</TE>
<TE>   Now the church says it will develop the site, using the former
Legacy plan as its blueprint. The church expects to announce a
development partner in weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the gardens and the historic mansions will be preserved,
said Bernard W. Schnippert, the church's director of finance and
planning. But instead of college students, the grounds will now be
maintained for the owners of the new luxury condos and million-dollar
homes. The future of the long-closed Ambassador Auditorium,
considered one of the finest concert halls in Southern California,
will also be decided in the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news is that so far the gardens have been recognized and
everyone is trying to keep much of its history intact," said Sue
Mossman, executive director of Pasadena Heritage.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the future, it won't be the site's first make-over.</TE>
<TE>   The history of the mansion now known as Merritt House began in
1903. That year, Hulett C. Merritt, investment banker, builder of
railways, multimillionaire at age 29 and reputedly the largest
stockholder in U.S. Steel, bought 2 1/2 acres of prime real estate
along South Orange Grove Boulevard. It was known then as
"Millionaires Row," named for the mansions being built by some of
America's wealthiest industrialists.</TE>
<TE>   Merritt built the 16-room, two-story Italian renaissance mansion,
filled it with art and parked the first domestic-made car in Pasadena
in its driveway. Leading up to the house is a long terraced staircase
flanked by 22 columnar Italian Cypress trees, each 60 feet tall.</TE>
<TE>   After Merritt's death in 1956, the house was sold to Ambassador
College and was remade into the home economics department, kitchen
and all.</TE>
<TE>   In its next life, it is slated to become the community center for
condo owners. Two other mansions might be transformed into
bed-and-breakfast establishments.</TE>
<TE>   As the church acquired more properties with their lavish
landscapes, it turned in 1963 to Garrett Eckbo, the dean of West
Coast landscape architects, to merge old gardens into a campuswide
design. More than 1,200 trees now grace the landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Grassman remembers the 1980s, when 1,200 students and 1,000
college employees brushed elbows on the pathways and studied beneath
the shade of his trees.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in the mid-1990s, a doctrinal schism erupted in the
Worldwide Church of God and much of the membership was lost, leading
to the closure of the college.</TE>
<TE>   As the new development plan runs through comprehensive studies and
City Hall analysis, the gardens remain suspended in time. Although
the land is private property, the church does not turn away strollers
and lunchtime visitors.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our secret garden, our secret playground, right girls?"
said John Fleck to his two daughters, Andrea, 5, and Renee, 9. They
brought Frisbees, bubbles and lunch Sunday afternoon to the site and
had the acreage to themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to keep coming here as long as we can."</TE>

<LD>A tanker truck was rear-ended Wednesday on Interstate 5 near Camp
Pendleton, spilling its cargo of jet fuel, blocking southbound lanes
for more than five hours and backing up traffic past San Clemente.</LD>
<LD>   A car collided with the truck and slid underneath it, said Officer
Phil Konstantin of the California Highway Patrol.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses to the 1:10 p.m. incident just south of Las Pulgas Road
in San Diego County said two people in the sedan fled on foot.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. Marine Corps personnel apprehended two people and turned them
over to the CHP for questioning, Konstantin said.</TE>
<TE>   The truck driver suffered minor injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The freeway was closed in both directions from 4:45 to 5:45 p.m.
while a hazardous-materials unit mopped up 20 gallons of fuel that
had spilled onto the road. All lanes reopened at 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Some travelers stuck in the jam that stretched more than 10 miles
into Orange County used roadside shrubbery as a rest area.</TE>
<TE>   One man with a bicycle pedaled to the front of the southbound
traffic line and returned with word that the next exit was three
miles away and that a cab up ahead wasn't moving but its meter was
running nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of motorists got an impromptu tour of the Marine base
when traffic was diverted off the freeway at the Las Pulgas exit.</TE>
<TE>   A CHP officer pulled over and lectured one driver who tried to
dodge the mess by driving in the emergency lane.</TE>
<TE>   "It's slow-going," said Mark Reeves, another CHP officer. "But
people have to be cautious when hazardous materials are involved."</TE>

<HD>Base Digging for Possible Chemical Agents</HD>
<DH>Edwards: Air Force to excavate WWII-era trenches near
airmen's dorms and move any hazardous materials to a safer area of
the facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Concerned that World War II-era trenches at Edwards Air Force Base
could contain mustard gas and other chemical warfare agents, the
military will begin a $4.5-million cleanup effort next week near a
group of airmen's dormitories, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The four buried trenches--part of a chemical storage yard that
closed in 1946 on the sprawling base north of Lancaster--were
discovered a few years ago as the Air Force made plans to build the
dorms about 25 feet away, Edwards spokesman Gary Hatch said.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists found no evidence of hazardous materials in the soil
around the trenches at that time, Hatch said, but the Air Force now
wants the trenches excavated.</LD>
<TE>   The cleanup will take about five months, he said, with crews
working inside a specially constructed mobile tent equipped with air
filtration systems. The soil will be placed in a lined dump on the
base's testing ground and any hazardous materials will be placed in
metal bins and stored in a warehouse on the base, far from regular
activities.</TE>
<TE>   "We're proceeding like there might be some materials in there,"
said Hatch, who added that no personnel would be relocated during the
process. Money for the cleanup will come from a U.S. Department of
Defense fund for environmental cleanups, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lyle Talbot, a member of the local environmental group Desert
Citizens Against Pollution, said he believes the chances of finding
chemical warfare agents are pretty high. Air Force records indicate
that the yard may have contained the blistering agents mustard gas,
lewisite and phosgene, as well as the choking agent chloropicrin.</TE>
<TE>   Talbot, a former member of the base's Restoration Advisory Board,
said no records have been uncovered that prove the chemicals were
destroyed: "They just apparently disposed of them in the trenches."</TE>
<TE>   Edwards officials said military records from the 1940s show that
the base didn't have the personnel on hand to close the chemical yard
properly, but they are not certain what actually happened.</TE>
<TE>   Though the U.S. Armed Forces have not produced chemical warfare
agents since 1991, authorities and communities across the country are
still dealing with their complicated legacy, said Craig Williams of
the Chemical Weapons Working Group, a Kentucky-based organization
that advocates cleanups of stockpiles.</TE>
<TE>   The Army is working on plans to dismantle its eight chemical
weapons stockpiles in the United States, said Larry McCaskill,
spokesman for the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland, where
1,600 tons of mustard agent have been stored since World War II and
are soon to be neutralized.</TE>
<TE>   On the campus of American University in Washington, D.C., the Army
is removing chemical warfare agents left from tests conducted there
during World War I, Hatch said.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Kornguth, director of the University of Texas' Biological
and Chemical Countermeasures Program, said it is possible that the
50-year-old chemicals at Edwards or elsewhere may no longer be a
health hazard. But Talbot, who said he has been fighting for the
cleanup since the mid-1990s, said it's important for the Air Force to
do the right thing at Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a number of offices within a quarter-mile of the site,"
he said. "Now, it's a chapter we can close."</TE>

<HD>Baldwin Park Man Agrees to Be Extradited to Thailand</HD>
<DH>Law: Defendant is a member of Garden Grove-based Free
Vietnam group and faces terrorism charges in bombing attempt at
embassy in Bangkok.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man who was arrested at John Wayne Airport last year in connection
with the attempted bombing of the Vietnamese Embassy in Bangkok will
be extradited to face trial for terrorism in Thailand, U.S.
prosecutors said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Van Duc Vo, a member of a Little Saigon-based organization
dedicated to overthrowing Vietnam's Communist government, was charged
in the United States with conspiracy to use a weapon of mass
destruction.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. attorney's office decided to drop the charges after Vo
agreed not to fight extradition to Thailand.</LD>
<TE>   Vo's trial is expected to shed light on Free Vietnam, a Garden
Grove organization run by several exiles that claims to have
established military training camps on Vietnam's border and vows to
one day "liberate" their homeland.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of Free Vietnam said they didn't order Vo to bomb the
embassy but described him as one of the organization's longtime
leaders. In the wake of Vo's arrest, the government of Vietnam called
on U.S. authorities to take action against Free Vietnam, which it
labels a terrorist organization.</TE>
<TE>   Vo faces nine counts of firearms and explosive charges in Thailand
and could be extradited within the next few months, said assistant
U.S. Atty. Andrew Brown. Vo said he is innocent and will vigorously
fight the charges in Bangkok.</TE>
<TE>   .</TE>
<TE>   Vo, 42, of Baldwin Park, was arrested Oct. 12 after he stepped off
a plane from Seattle. Prosecutors alleged that Vo and another man
checked into the Reo Residence Hotel in Thailand and bought two cell
phones four days before the bombing attempt.</TE>
<TE>   At 4 a.m. on June 19, 2001, Vo allegedly placed a backpack full of
explosives in front of the Vietnamese Embassy's gates and threw a
brown cardboard box over the fence, authorities said. The box
contained 11 pounds of diesel fuel and ammonium nitrate--the same
type of mixture used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, prosecutors
said.</TE>
<TE>   Both bags had notes attached and were linked to a detonator that
was supposed to be activated by a cell phone. Prosecutors said the
detonator malfunctioned, preventing a explosion that could have
killed or injured dozens of people. Vo, a former architectural
student and construction contractor, is a commander of the Thailand,
Cambodia and Vietnamese region for Free Vietnam. The group has been
battling the Vietnamese government for years, publishing opposition
newspapers inside the country and mounting "war games" on the border.
Authorities also have linked Free Vietnam members to attempted
bombings at Vietnamese embassies across Asia and Europe. Vo's
brother, Van Tri Vo, is facing charges for attempted bombings in
Manila.</TE>
<TE>   Vo's attorneys said their client had no intention of blowing up
anything in Bangkok. They said Vo didn't plant the bombs, and once he
saw them tried to alert authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to save innocent lives," said Jimmy Tong Nguyen, an
investigator working for the defense. "He's a peaceful person with
good judgment, not a terrorist."</TE>
<TE>   More than 40 supporters, including Vo's parents and his oldest
daughter, Diane, and some members of the Free Vietnam group, packed
the courtroom to show their support.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always told him to take care of his family," said Vo's
mother, Tim Nguyen, 77, of Baldwin Park, as she wiped away tears.
"But he is so adamant about overthrowing the Communists. He'd rather
die at sea than live under their rule."</TE>

<LD>The Wolf fire in Los Padres National Forest was 85% contained late
Wednesday, and fire officials were anticipating total containment by
early Friday evening.</LD>
<LD>   For a third straight day Wednesday, firefighters held the blaze to
21,278 acres while a fleet of helicopters dropped water and fire
retardant, said Joe Pasinato, a U.S. Forest Service spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   More than 1,200 firefighters were battling the blaze but officials
were gradually releasing personnel, many of whom will be reassigned
to major fires in Colorado.</LD>
<TE>   Since the Wolf fire started June 1, the cost of fighting it has
reached $13.2 million.</TE>

<HD>Palestinians in Gaza Have Roadblock Rage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GUSH KATIF, Gaza Strip</DL>
<LD>The four-hour wait at an Israeli roadblock had left Wafa Ashur
exhausted and enraged--again.</LD>
<LD>   In her arms, she held her 8-month-old daughter, Rawiya. Wedged
between her and another passenger in the stifling taxi was her
5-year-old son, Saado, his eyes dulled with boredom and fatigue. And
as far as the eye could see ahead and behind them were hundreds of
other Palestinian mothers, fathers, children, workers and students,
caught in what for thousands of Palestinians is a daily ritual.</LD>
<LD>   Roadblocks have become the most hated and ubiquitous symbol of
Israel's military intrusion into Palestinian lives in the last 20
months. And no roadblock is more tortuous than the one here at Gush
Katif, where the only north-south artery of the Gaza Strip intersects
a road that connects a cluster of 15 Jewish settlements to pre-1967
Israel.</LD>
<TE>   On this desolate and dusty stretch of roadway, Israel's stated
policy of sparing Palestinian civilians in its fight against
militants has broken down. Here, and at dozens of other roadblocks in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the endless waits at checkpoints that
the army says are vital security measures have created the sort of
mass misery for Palestinians that successive Israeli governments
tried for decades to avoid.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two years, Palestinian militants have repeatedly
attacked civilian and military convoys traveling to and from Gush
Katif, killing and wounding Jewish settlers and soldiers in suicide
bombings and drive-by shootings. All told, the militants have killed
about 20 Israeli civilians and 35 soldiers in Gaza since hostilities
erupted in September 2000, according to the army.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the attacks, the army has imposed what it
acknowledges are draconian measures designed to separate the two
peoples. They are steps that the army says it knows exact a heavy
toll.</TE>
<TE>   "This pressure we are putting on them is no good for us," said
Brig. Gen. Zvi Fogel, chief of staff for the army's southern command.
"When normal civilians are kept here for hours, they become angry and
frustrated. We know that if the situation goes on like this for a few
more months, the potential for suicide bombers will be much greater."</TE>
<TE>   Fogel said he is trying to limit the hardships imposed on Gaza's
1.5 million Palestinians as the army tries to protect the 8,000
Jewish settlers living in closely guarded communities scattered among
them. But in a conflict where Palestinian teenagers and even women
are now carrying out suicide attacks on Israelis, anything resembling
normality is becoming a fading memory for most of the people living
here.</TE>
<TE>   "It is purely harassment, to blackmail us," fumed Abdel Rahman
Katrousi, an engineer with the Palestinian Authority who was stuck at
the Gush Katif roadblock on the same day as Ashur. "They would love
to make us surrender. This is a prelude to transfer."</TE>
<TE>   He was referring to a concept once embraced only by the radical
fringe of Israeli politics that is gaining popularity with the right
wing as the fighting wears on and Israeli casualties mount. Under
such a "transfer," large numbers of Palestinians from the West Bank
and Gaza Strip would be voluntarily or forcibly expelled to
neighboring Arab states.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians say they believe it is not just out of security
concerns that the Jewish state blocks their roads, barricades their
towns and bans their workers from entering Israel. Many believe that
the measures are meant to deny them the possibility of earning a
living or leading a productive life, and force them to emigrate.</TE>
<TE>   Katrousi, who lives in Rafah, on Gaza's southern border, said he
leaves at 8 a.m. every day for what used to be a half-hour commute to
his office in Gaza City. These days, he said, he is lucky if he makes
it to work by 11 a.m. Sometimes, he arrives as late as 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, I sign in and turn around and come back," he said
gloomily. "Then I wait here for I don't know how long. One time, it
took me 36 hours to get home."</TE>
<TE>   Other Palestinians take extraordinary measures to avoid the long
lines, even driving on the beaches of the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Fogel vehemently denies that the army is trying to make life
impossible for Palestinians. "The settlers of Gush Katif need the
Palestinian workers, and the Palestinians need the settlements as
places to work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It takes too long for vehicles to pass through the Gush Katif
roadblock, Fogel acknowledged, but Palestinian civilians are
suffering because "we have become much more suspicious of the
population." On the day that Ashur and her children and several
hundred other Palestinians ended up sleeping at the roadblock, he
pointed out, soldiers had found weapons in some cars, wanted
militants in others.</TE>
<TE>   "We arrested 23 people that night," he said. Some, he said, were
trying to carry out attacks on the settlers.</TE>
<TE>   Over the protests of Palestinians and some settlers, the army is
in the process of completing a $3-million east-west overpass that
will allow the settlers of Gush Katif to drive on a bridge over the
intersecting north-south artery on which the Palestinians drive.</TE>
<TE>   The bridge is guarded by two reinforced concrete towers equipped
with night-vision devices and other high-tech systems, Fogel said.</TE>
<TE>   It is lined on either side with concrete blocks that make it
impossible to see who is driving on it from below.</TE>
<TE>   The army has destroyed orchards and homes around the bridge where
attackers might lurk and intends to fortify its underbelly to protect
it from suicide bombers driving on the Palestinian road that passes
beneath.</TE>
<TE>   The general dismissed criticism from some settlers who have said
they will boycott the bridge as unsafe because it separates them from
the Palestinians and makes them easy targets for attack.</TE>
<TE>   On the contrary, he said, the bridge will both protect settlers
and "act almost as a highway for Palestinians" once it is completed,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians traveling north-south will be able to do so with far
fewer waits at the roadblock once settlers are driving safely
overhead, Fogel said.</TE>
<TE>   And those few Palestinian workers who still have jobs in Gush
Katif will soon be given magnetic cards and passed through roadblocks
where computers will confirm their identities.</TE>
<TE>   South of the settlement bloc, soldiers are building a checkpoint
that the general said will function "like an airport terminal" for
workers who now wait an hour or longer to be searched and allowed
into the settlements.</TE>
<TE>   "It should reduce the waiting time in the mornings to about 20
minutes," Fogel said.</TE>
<TE>   But few of the people stuck daily at the Gush Katif roadblock
believe that the remedies Fogel speaks of will be implemented soon,
or will improve their lives when they are.</TE>
<TE>   Like everyone else in line the afternoon of June 2, Ashur had no
idea when the cars ahead of her would begin to move, when the
soldiers would decide to let them through. She only knew that the
trip from nearby Khan Yunis to Gaza City that used to take 20 minutes
each way now routinely takes six hours round trip.</TE>
<TE>   She must make the trips, Ashur said, because Gaza City has the
only hospital here capable of operating on Rawiya to correct her
clubfoot. For the last month, she has taken Rawiya in for tests at
least twice a week.</TE>
<TE>   "On Wednesday, when I was coming back from the hospital, they
closed the roadblock at 1 p.m. and we had to sleep here, in the taxi,
until 4:30 Thursday morning," Ashur said. "There is no one to leave
Saado with, so I must bring him. I tried to approach the soldiers, to
explain about the baby. They told me: 'Go away.' I have to just wait
and wait. What can I do?"</TE>
<TE>   The roadblock has opened opportunities to some enterprising
Palestinians, among them young boys who "rent" themselves to drivers.
The army requires at least three passengers per vehicle, a safety
precaution meant to reduce the risk that a vehicle will be used for a
suicide attack, the Palestinians explained.</TE>
<TE>   When a driver is alone, or has just one passenger, he "rents" boys
who stand on the side of the road, paying them about 50 cents to make
the slow, sometimes dangerous trip past the checkpoint.</TE>
<TE>   "I make the trip twice a week, every Saturday and Tuesday," said
Ramzi abu Taha, a 35-year-old engineer who commutes between his home
in Rafah and his office in Gaza City. From Saturday until Tuesday, he
said, he sleeps in Gaza to avoid the commute. Munir Elghawage, a slip
of a boy who said he was 14 but looked much younger, sat beside him
in his taxi.</TE>
<TE>   "I picked him up," Taha said. "I'll pay him a couple of shekels
for making the ride. We have to keep coming through. We have to
resist. We have no choice."</TE>
<TE>   In the last few months, roadside stands have sprung up to sell
those stuck here everything from falafel sandwiches to sweets.</TE>
<TE>   Ayman Moussa opened his stand a month ago. He sells falafel
sandwiches for about 20 cents apiece. "My customers are always
exhausted," said Moussa, 35, who sold cell phones before the fighting
broke out. "They are frustrated and angry--imagine how you would
feel, sitting in a car for 10 hours."</TE>
<TE>   The day that hundreds were trapped at the roadblock overnight,
Moussa said, he sold 1,000 sandwiches. But other days, the roadblock
suddenly opens "and I have to throw food out." Still, he said he is
confident enough that the situation will continue that he plans to
bring in a generator, install a refrigerator and expand his menu.</TE>
<TE>   Gesturing to the men and boys playing cards, drinking coffee or
huddling in groups near their cars, Moussa said the long waits are
hardest on the women. "There is no bathroom here," he said. "In our
culture, they cannot simply get out of their cars and relieve
themselves on the side of the road. It is very, very difficult for
them."</TE>
<TE>   All around, boys carrying pots of steaming tea and coffee or boxes
of ice cream bars wove among the parked cars and vans, peddling their
wares. Four busloads of teenagers from a technical school run by the
United Nations in Gaza City played cards under scraggly bushes that
provided scant shade and talked about the rage they feel as they sit
here every day.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, it can take five or six hours to get to school," said
Abram Arbashli, an 18-year-old from Khan Yunis. Several dozen boys
leave school by 4 p.m. and sometimes arrive home by midnight. The
boredom, he and others said, is hard to cope with.</TE>
<TE>   As they spoke, a fight broke out between two boys. Dozens quickly
joined in, and a brawl ensued until adults stepped in to break it up.
Such fights, the youths said, are commonplace as tempers fray.</TE>
<TE>   But all said they have never considered quitting school. "We have
to continue our education," Arbashli said. "In two more months, I'll
have my diploma."</TE>

a gasoline bomb at a Roman Catholic elementary school in west
Belfast, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Police said the bomb was thrown through a window of a classroom at
the Holy Rosary School, near Ormeau Road, scene of recent clashes
between Protestants and Catholics. The classroom suffered severe
smoke and water damage and the windows of four other classrooms were
broken, a spokesman said. Nobody was injured.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate incident Tuesday night, Catholics in north Belfast

<LD>   Serbian leaders formally ended a boycott of Kosovo's fledgling
government and took an oath of office alongside their ethnic Albanian
colleagues, the Yugoslav province's U.N. administration said.</LD>
<TE>   The Serbs swore to act "in the best interests of all the
inhabitants of Kosovo without discrimination on any ground."</TE>
<TE>   Kosovo's Serbs earlier had insisted on the establishment of a
special ministry for refugee returns as a condition for entering the
ethnic Albanian-dominated government. Instead, two new posts were
created: an inter-ministerial coordinator for refugee returns and a
senior advisor to the office of Kosovo's U.N. governor.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Faults Colombia in Joint Drug Battle</HD>
<DH>Military: Congressional report says S. American nation
hasn't provided the personnel it pledged. White House is seeking more
aid for the effort.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Even as the Bush administration is lobbying to increase U.S. military
aid to Colombia, the South American nation is failing to do its part
in a joint effort to combat narcotics trafficking, according to an
unreleased congressional report.</LD>
<LD>   The report, from the General Accounting Office, says Colombia has
failed to provide military pilots for 14 U.S.-supplied Black Hawk
helicopters, leaving the high-tech aircraft idle. It says the
country's armed forces have not supplied all the personnel promised
for programs to train pilots and mechanics, and recently cut back on
drug crop-eradication programs because of "political concerns."</LD>
<LD>   Plans for using U.S. military aid "have fallen substantially
behind schedule, and prospects for near-term fixes are bleak,"
according to the brief report, which has not been released publicly
but was provided to relevant congressional committees this week.</LD>
<TE>   It is the first time that a government report meant for public
circulation has faulted the Colombian armed forces' cooperation in
Plan Colombia, the anti-drug effort to which the United States has
committed about $2 billion since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   It reflects the view, held by many who advocate a stepped-up U.S.
role, that the Andean nation must do its share if the United States
is to provide the additional money and assistance the Colombians
seek.</TE>
<TE>   But those who doubt the wisdom of greater U.S. activity also are
likely to seize on the report as evidence that the three-sided fight
involving left-wing insurgent groups, right-wing paramilitary forces
and the Colombian military will become a quagmire for the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   In the short term, the report's results will add to the pressure
on Colombia's president-elect, Alvaro Uribe, to commit greater
resources to the battle. Uribe, who was elected last month and takes
office in August, is to meet in Washington next week with Bush
administration officials and congressional leaders.</TE>
<TE>   One U.S. official who asked to remain unidentified said that
although leaders of the incoming Colombian government are demanding
increased U.S. aid, "if they're not doing their part, it makes no
sense for us to provide it." The official noted that Colombia is
already the third-largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid.</TE>
<TE>   John P. Walters, head of the Bush administration's drug control
office, has been arguing that Colombia needs to at least double its
spending, which now amounts to about 3.5% of the country's gross
domestic product, on the anti-drug effort.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Colombian Embassy in Washington said they had not
seen the GAO report and were unable to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The report says that many U.S. officials interviewed "expressed
frustration with the overall pace of Plan Colombia, and the lack of
Colombian commitment to the program, and expressed interest in having
GAO examine the status and effectiveness of U.S. counter-narcotics
assistance to the Colombian military."</TE>
<TE>   Plan Colombia called for the United States to provide 14 Black
Hawk and 30 new Super Huey helicopters to transport U.S.-trained
counter-narcotics troops to conduct anti-drug operations. All the
Black Hawks have arrived, and the Super Hueys are due before the end
of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The Colombian army was supposed to provide about 250 pilots for
training and other personnel for mechanics training. But it has been
slow to do so, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   It says the Colombians also were not maintaining 10 older Huey
UH-1H helicopters that were sent to provide initial training for the
pilots.</TE>
<TE>   The Colombian government is relying on the State Department's
contractor, DynCorp, to maintain a fleet of 36 Huey UH-1N helicopters
that were provided as an interim step until the more advanced
helicopters arrived.</TE>
<TE>   The report also notes that the Colombian government has not
increased military spending, nor has it changed its conscription laws
to provide more manpower for the military force. Colombian laws
exempt high school graduates from combat duty.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has asked Congress for permission to begin
using aid not only for the counter-narcotics fight in Colombia but in
a broader military effort to fight insurgents whom the administration
considers terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Congress will soon begin considering an administration request for
an additional $400 million in aid for fiscal 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Rieser, an aide to Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), who has
urged caution in the U.S. mission, said the report "obviously raises
a lot of questions that need to be answered."</TE>
<TE>   "This needs to be a partnership, and we have to be much clearer
with the Colombians about what they need to do if the United States
is going to continue to provide this kind of support," Rieser said.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Isacson, an analyst at the Center for International Policy in
Washington, said that although other aspects of Plan Colombia have
come in for official criticism, "this is the first time that they
have pointed a finger at the Colombian army for what's been happening
here."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Shifter, a Latin America specialist at the Inter-American
Dialogue in Washington, said the report reflected "a sense of
disappointment that is broadly shared" about Colombia's contribution
to fighting its war.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Plane Crashes in Afghanistan; 3 Killed</HD>
<DH>War: The MC-130 does not seem to have been hit by hostile
fire, officials say. Seven are injured.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An Air Force combat plane carrying 10 crew members and passengers
crashed Wednesday shortly after taking off from a military base in
Afghanistan, killing three on board, U.S. defense officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The other seven people on the MC-130 were transferred to a
military medical facility in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar for
treatment. The bodies of the three who were killed were recovered at
the site, the Pentagon said.</LD>
<LD>   Military officials did not know what caused the 9:30 p.m. crash
about 40 miles southwest of the city of Gardez, but they said the
four-engine, propeller-driven Combat Talon aircraft did not appear to
have been struck by hostile fire.</LD>
<TE>   The crash occurred in a mountainous region where U.S.-led
coalition forces have been searching for Al Qaeda and Taliban
holdouts.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon is investigating the crash. The names of those on
board were being withheld.</TE>
<TE>   Before Wednesday, 37 U.S. service members had been killed in and
around Afghanistan since the war began in October, said Marine Lt.
Col. David Lapan, a Pentagon spokesman. Of those, 18 were killed in
action, including 15 by hostile fire and three in a "friendly fire"
incident. The rest died in aircraft and other accidents and, in at
least one case, apparent suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Those figures exclude CIA agent Johnny "Mike" Spann, who was
killed in November in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.</TE>
<TE>   The Combat Talon is a version of the C-130 cargo plane modified
for combat use by Special Forces. It is designed to penetrate hostile
airspace at low altitudes to pick up and drop off troops and
supplies. It is equipped with special night-flying capability, can be
refueled in midair and land on short runways.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier versions of the aircraft were used in the attempted
rescues of Americans at a Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camp in 1970 and
of American hostages in Iran in 1980. The plane delivered Army
Rangers to Grenada in 1983 and Panama in 1989. C-130s were used as
bombers in the Persian Gulf War in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Before the latest incident, a dozen Americans had died in
Afghan-related air crashes. The downing of a CH-53E Super Stallion
copter killed two Marines in northern Afghanistan on Jan. 20.</TE>
<TE>   An air tanker crashed in Pakistan on Jan. 9, killing seven
Marines. An F-14 Tomcat fighter jet crashed during training in the
Mediterranean Sea, killing a Navy pilot March 2. And a Black Hawk
helicopter went down in Pakistan on Oct. 19, killing two soldiers.</TE>

<HD>Biotechnology Debate Takes Center Stage at Food Summit</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: As activists and delegates weigh in,
researchers unveil a new effort to fund 'gene banks' to save unusual
crops from extinction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>As delegates at a U.N. summit on world hunger debated the risks and
benefits of genetically modified crops, agricultural researchers on
Wednesday announced a new effort to save unusual strains of food
plants from extinction.</LD>
<LD>   The move to establish a $260-million endowment to guarantee steady
funding for key "gene banks" around the world would preserve a wide
variety of food crop seeds, the U.N.-backed group of research
organizations said. The seeds could be used both as a source of genes
for biologically engineered new crop varieties and to produce new
hybrids by traditional crossbreeding.</LD>
<LD>   "All crop improvement--whether it's through conventional plant
breeding ... [or] the latest genetic engineering techniques--requires
genetic diversity," Geoffrey Hawtin, director general of the
Rome-based International Plant Genetic Resources Institute, said at a
news conference. "So we do not look on these gene banks as being
either supportive of or counter to the issue of genetic
modification."</LD>
<TE>   Some delegates at the four-day U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization-sponsored summit, which concludes today, have raised
concerns about biotechnology, but the general tone has been
supportive.</TE>
<TE>   That stance has drawn sharp criticism from participants in a
parallel conference of nongovernmental organizations, where many
would like to ban production of all genetically modified organisms,
often referred to as GMOs.</TE>
<TE>   Vandana Shiva, a prominent Indian campaigner against genetically
modified crops, said the world hunger summit is "really a summit for
promoting GMOs and their trade and free circulation."</TE>
<TE>   Anti-GMO activists argue that genetically modified seeds are being
pressed on farmers not because they boost yields and potentially
reduce hunger but rather because they enrich the firms holding the
patents.</TE>
<TE>   The Food and Agriculture Organization takes the position that more
biotechnology research targeted at helping developing countries
should be supported by governments and international organizations.
The project to support gene banks could play a role in such efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The new endowment should be sufficient, Hawtin said, to ensure the
preservation of varieties identified as the most important in an
international treaty on plant genetic resources approved last year by
a Food and Agriculture Organization conference and signed so far by
43 countries.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,300 gene banks around the world preserve 6.6 million
samples of food crop seeds or wild plants, including hundreds of
thousands of different varieties, according to U.N. statistics. Seeds
are usually placed in sealed jars or packets and frozen, which allows
them to be stored for decades.</TE>
<TE>   But many key facilities, often government-run, receive only
year-to-year funding and now face gradual cutbacks that threaten the
loss of many varieties currently preserved, Hawtin said. The
endowment, which will be sought from public and private sources,
would be paired with steps to better coordinate the global effort to
store seed samples, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Participants in the U.N. summit have raised issues such as whether
corporate patents on genetically modified seeds lock poor farmers out
of the benefits. Some delegates also question whether genetically
modified food may pose health risks.</TE>
<TE>   People in Europe in general and Italy in particular tend to be
more skeptical of genetically modified foods than are most Americans.
A poll of Italians this year by the Milan-based Giannino Bassetti
Foundation, which studies innovation in business, found that 38% of
respondents opposed any sales of genetically modified foods and 95%
said that if they are sold, they should be clearly labeled.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a document on ways to attack poverty and hunger--approved
by delegates without dissent--backs "research into new technologies,
including biotechnology."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of biotechnology are particularly critical of so-called
terminator technology, in which high-yield or pest- and
disease-resistant seeds are modified so that seeds from the crops
they produce will not germinate. In many poorer countries, farmers
save part of their crop for the next planting, but anyone using this
technology must buy new seeds every year.</TE>
<TE>   Critics at the parallel conference have also charged that firms
selling genetically modified seeds engage in "biopiracy" when they
use genetic material from poor countries to produce patented
products.</TE>
<TE>   But such criticisms did little to dent the enthusiasm for
bioengineering at the official summit.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Agency for International Development, for example,
distributed materials detailing its efforts to use both traditional
hybrid techniques and biotechnology to produce nutrient-enhanced
varieties of cassava, beans, sweet potatoes and maize. The agency has
supported the development of high-iron beans, high-beta-carotene
sweet potatoes and maize rich in vitamin A, iron and zinc, it said.</TE>
<TE>   About 2 billion people in poorer countries suffer from deficiency
of at least one nutrient.</TE>

<HD>Signs of Al Qaeda Presence Seen in Kashmir, U.S. Says</HD>
<DH>Asia: Rumsfeld, in visit, backs India's claim that
terrorists are operating in the disputed region.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>Al Qaeda fighters appear to have moved into the disputed region of
Kashmir, U.S. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Wednesday,
backing a key Indian allegation that terrorists operating in Pakistan
remain a serious threat.</LD>
<LD>   Rumsfeld, who is visiting India and then Pakistan in an effort to
further ease military tensions, said there are signs that Al Qaeda
terrorists are near the volatile cease-fire line that divides the two
nations' areas in Kashmir.</LD>
<LD>   "I have seen indications that there are in fact Al Qaeda operating
in the area that we're talking about, near the Line of Control,"
Rumsfeld told a brief news conference after talks here with Indian
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.</LD>
<TE>   "I do not have hard evidence of precisely how many, or who, or
where," Rumsfeld added. "And needless to say, there are an awful lot
of people in the world who want to do anything possible to stop Al
Qaeda from planning and executing additional terrorist acts."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld did not say on which side of the line Al Qaeda fighters
are believed to be operating. When asked whether U.S. forces would
take their hunt for the fighters into Kashmir, the defense secretary
did not answer directly but praised Pakistan's assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "Specifically, in the case of Al Qaeda in Pakistan, the Pakistan
government has been very cooperative with the United States in
helping to locate and, in a number of instances, they have actually
captured Al Qaeda and turned them over to us, which has been a very
helpful thing," Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Before flying Wednesday night to Islamabad, Pakistan's capital,
Rumsfeld held a series of meetings with Indian officials, including
National Security Advisor Brajesh Mishra and Defense Minister George
Fernandes.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians remain skeptical about Pakistani President Pervez
Musharraf's promise to stop militants from using Pakistan as a launch
pad for attacks against India. But for now, they appear to have
accepted U.S. assurances that the Pakistani leader is sincere.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Fernandes repeated his claim that Taliban troops and Al
Qaeda fighters from Afghanistan had found sanctuary in Pakistan's
unruly North-West Frontier Province and in the roughly one-third of
Kashmir controlled by Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "We are deeply concerned that these cadres would be encouraged to
indulge in terrorist violence against India," Fernandes told a
regional security conference in Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   India has used that danger, and other perceived threats, to
justify keeping several hundred thousand troops on high alert along
the front line with Pakistan and will feel vindicated by Rumsfeld's
confirmation that Al Qaeda fighters appear to be in the same area.</TE>
<TE>   But Musharraf on Wednesday repeated his assertion that the danger
of war between the two nuclear-armed neighbors won't pass until India
pulls its forces back to peacetime positions.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation will remain grim till we disengage on the border,"
Musharraf told reporters after talks with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah
in the Red Sea city of Jidda.</TE>
<TE>   Although tensions are easing, the Pakistani leader said, things
"can change any time."</TE>
<TE>   India and Pakistan reported heavy exchanges of artillery fire
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan said Indian forces shelled five areas in the southern and
western parts of the portion of Kashmir it controls. A Pakistani
soldier reportedly was wounded by artillery fire near the town of
Sialkot, a few miles west of the border with the Indian-controlled
sector of Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   Indian army spokesperson Lt. Col. S.K. Singh said two Indian
civilians were killed during clashes across the front line near
Naushahra, about 60 miles northwest of Jammu, the winter capital of
India's Jammu and Kashmir state.</TE>
<TE>   Singh said Indian and Pakistani troops also unleashed heavy
artillery barrages on the northern and southern ends of the Siachen
Glacier, which, at about 20,000 feet, is the world's highest
battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   It is also an extraordinarily expensive place to wage war because
ammunition, fuel and supplies such as bread and milk must be
airlifted in. So the glacier has long been a symbol of the madness of
a seemingly endless conflict between two countries that suffer some
of the worst poverty in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld praised India's announcement this week that it was
reopening its airspace to Pakistani commercial flights, which are
still not allowed to land at Indian airports, and withdrawing several
navy ships from threatening positions along Pakistan's Arabian Sea
coast.</TE>
<TE>   But Pakistan's Foreign Ministry called the moves "gestures which
carry little substance." It criticized India for not addressing what
Pakistan considers the main cause of tension--the two countries'
55-year dispute over Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   "We trust that India will soon announce further steps leading to
the resumption of a meaningful dialogue between the two countries,
especially the core issue of Kashmir," a Foreign Ministry statement
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan hopes that the crisis will lead to international
mediation in the conflict for control of Kashmir, a mainly Muslim
territory that India and Pakistan each claim, but where support for
outright independence is strong.</TE>
<TE>   During his talks with Indian leaders, Rumsfeld didn't present
specific proposals to ease tensions but discussed various options,
according to a U.S. official who briefed reporters.</TE>
<TE>   They included planting electronic monitoring devices, which Indian
intelligence sources ruled out in interviews this week as a largely
ineffective tool against infiltrators along the Line of Control. The
line runs 450 miles through rugged, often mountainous, terrain.</TE>

<HD>Uneasy Calm on a Stretch of Kashmir Front</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHAKOTHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>For all the talk of easing tensions between India and Pakistan, the
reality of relations between the subcontinent's large and quarrelsome
neighbors lies here in the mountains of Kashmir.</LD>
<LD>   It isn't pretty.</LD>
<LD>   Strung out along either side of a 450-mile cease-fire line drawn
after a 1971 war, soldiers from two of the world's largest armies
remain on high alert. At some points in the rugged Chakothi sector,
where 13,000-foot peaks plunge almost vertically into valleys
thousands of feet below, less than 100 yards separate Indian and
Pakistani positions.</LD>
<TE>   Senior Pakistani military officers said this week that they had
detected no hint of relaxation along the front.</TE>
<TE>   "It's every bit as volatile as it was two or three weeks ago,"
said Brig. Iftikhar Ali Khan, who commands Pakistani forces along a
30-mile stretch of the Line of Control that divides Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   So far, he said Tuesday, there has been no discernible decline in
the sporadic shelling or exchanges of small-arms fire across the line
that have become part of the rhythm of life since the two armies
mobilized this year.</TE>
<TE>   Chakothi itself last came under intense fire May 18. Khan said
Indian forces sent an estimated 600 to 800 rounds of artillery
crashing into and around the town that day. It was one of the most
intense barrages since the crisis began about six months ago. Several
of those rounds appeared to have landed in an army administrative
area, while at least two went through the roof of the local secondary
school a few hundred yards away.</TE>
<TE>   Mumtaz Ali, a janitor at the school, said that no one was
killed--though school was in session at the time--because students
had been evacuated to nearby underground shelters.</TE>
<TE>   Nazeen Bibi, 28, wasn't so lucky.</TE>
<TE>   Family members said she was killed by one of the barrage's first
rounds when she was caught in the open as she walked across a field
with her 1-year-old daughter.</TE>
<TE>   In quieter times, the Indian and Pakistani area commanders would
meet briefly about once a month on a bridge over the Jhelum River, at
the Line of Control. They would check a hotline connecting military
headquarters of the two countries to make sure that it was working.
Those checks stopped in December, and there has been no contact
since.</TE>
<TE>   This week, an uneasy calm prevailed in the Chakothi sector. From
the horizontal slit of a Pakistani observation post, Indian army
positions on mountain slopes several hundred yards ahead were clearly
visible but quiet.</TE>
<TE>   As a Pakistani army patrol moved cautiously down a dirt track in
the direction of the border, the only sounds audible were those of
nature: chirping birds, occasional thunder from rain clouds gathered
above jutting peaks and the rush of the Jhelum River in full flow as
it carried the late spring Himalayan snowmelt through the narrow
valley floor below.</TE>
<TE>   Frequent rains have enabled a generous layer of ferns and other
undergrowth to thrive among the majestic pines and spindly hardwood
trees despite the altitude, making it possible for small groups to
operate undetected, especially at night. India's claims that Pakistan
trains and then helps Islamic militants infiltrate the line to
conduct armed attacks in Indian-controlled areas have been a major
factor in the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Khan, however, insisted that no such groups have gone through his
sector.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is allowed to cross the line," he said. "No one."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, along the narrow twisting road leading west from
Chakothi, about a dozen buses carted protesters to a rally in
Muzaffarabad, the capital of the Pakistani-controlled portion of
Kashmir. They were going to demonstrate against Pakistani President
Pervez Musharraf's recent promise to halt the infiltration by
militants.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue to cross the Line of Control as the struggle for
Kashmir's freedom continues," pledged Qazi Hussain Ahmed, leader of
Pakistan's largest religious-based political party, Jamaat-i-Islami.
"We will not allow a weak ruler to sell out on Kashmir."</TE>

<HD>Afghans Take Turns at Venting</HD>
<DH>Politics: First full day of loya jirga is vibrant and rowdy
as delegates discuss nation's ills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Eager to vent their views after two days of perceived deal-making
behind their backs, delegates to Afghanistan's freewheeling grand
assembly took to the floor Wednesday with passionate debate, an ode
to warlords, a scuffle with peacekeepers and veiled threats that
renewed civil war is looming.</LD>
<LD>   This ravaged nation's first grappling with democracy in decades
was rowdy enough to make the uninitiated mindful of the adage that no
one wants to watch laws or sausages in the making.</LD>
<LD>   But by local standards, the first full day of the weeklong
gathering to choose national leaders stimulated vibrant and overdue
discussion of all that ails Afghanistan. The delegates' unbridled
enthusiasm portended a more raucous and unpredictable exchange than
seemed likely earlier this week, when foreign diplomats and Afghans
holding interim power were scripting the session before it opened.</LD>
<TE>   Delegates seized on their chance to pontificate with gusto,
arguing early into this morning.</TE>
<TE>   The marathon talks ostensibly focused on choosing a conference
chairman. The selection was a formality, but it didn't seem so as
delegates channeled pent-up energy into the decision at hand after
their chief task--electing a head of state--was essentially taken
from them. Interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai is expected to be
named transitional president without serious challenge before the end
of the week.</TE>
<TE>   After an overnight session, the delegates selected as conference
chairman Ismail Qasimyar, the chief of the organizing committee of
the loya jirga, or grand assembly, despite his perceived
collaboration with the Karzai Cabinet and Western diplomats to ensure
that the interim prime minister is chosen as leader.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammad Zaher Shah, the nation's former monarch, withdrew his
candidacy for head of state Monday under U.S. pressure. Former
President Burhanuddin Rabbani did likewise Tuesday, leaving the field
largely clear for Karzai. The 44-year-old ethnic Pushtun interim
leader is widely respected, but delegates have been chafing under the
impression that their role has been hijacked by secret wheeling and
dealing.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the enthusiasm for discussion was feverish, if not always
refined. Turbaned elders, sartorial emigres and newly empowered women
lined up by the dozens to make their points, often to lambaste
organizers for giving gunmen who destroyed Afghanistan during 23
years of war a place at their forum.</TE>
<TE>   "We were told the loya jirga would be off-limits to those with
blood on their hands, yet we see these people everywhere," charged
Safar Mohammed, an elderly delegate. "There are so many men with guns
here that I don't know if I'm at a loya jirga or a military
convention."</TE>
<TE>   The warlords' residual power was apparent in a clash between one
delegate's bodyguards and German peacekeepers early Wednesday. When
troops of the International Security Assistance Force stopped two
truckloads of gunmen headed for the loya jirga site, four of the
Afghans drew weapons, inciting a scuffle that ended with the
bodyguards being handed over to local police.</TE>
<TE>   The gunmen were escorting Afghanistan's ambassador to Britain,
Ahmad Wali Masoud, brother of the late warrior Ahmed Shah Masoud, who
was assassinated by Al Qaeda agents two days before the Sept. 11
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Masoud told journalists Wednesday that the scuffle outside the
assembly site was "a very small misunderstanding that was cleared up
quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Armed undercover agents of the National Security Directorate, a
state intelligence force under the control of the late Masoud's
fellow commanders in the Northern Alliance, also have been stalking
the giant tent where the delegates are gathering.</TE>
<TE>   Afghans' notorious reflex to reach for the gun was apparent in the
not-so-subtle warnings of warlord Abdul Rasul Sayyaf,  who said he
was dismayed to hear his fellow delegates speaking ill of the
moujahedeen fighters who had helped liberate them from Soviet
occupation and the Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   "I say to my friends here who are insulting the gunmen that we owe
our peace and freedom to the army," he said in a fiery warning.</TE>
<TE>   Because Sayyaf still controls one of the more menacing armed
factions accused of human rights abuses against ethnic rivals, his
defense of the past bloodletting was taken by many as a threat of
reprisal.</TE>
<TE>   Some foreign observers watched the displays of military muscle
with more wonder than dismay. "I was amazed to see in the first and
second rows those so-called warlords sitting together," European
Union envoy Klaus-Peter Klaiber told a news conference. "It tells me
one thing: The interim administration has decided to try to integrate
former warlords into policymaking in Kabul. If they succeed, that
will be an achievement."</TE>
<TE>   The spirited debate reflected Afghans' hunger for stability and
acceptance in the wider world. So eager were the delegates to do
their part in ushering in a new era that, at one point, more than 30
candidates were vying to chair the conference. They also spurned
breaks suggested by the temporary chairman, Qasimyar, especially as
he came under fire for using the podium to further his candidacy to
run the show.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you thinking about in considering this inefficient old

<HD>Taliban Leader Reportedly Says Bin Laden Still Plotting</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>A Russian newspaper on Wednesday published what it said was an
interview with the leader of the ousted Taliban regime, claiming that
Osama bin Laden was alive in Afghanistan and threatening new attacks
on Americans.</LD>
<LD>   The online edition of Argumenty i Fakty weekly said Mullah
Mohammed Omar replied "a few days ago" through the Internet to
questions sent to him in the early spring through mediators,
including former Taliban officials and Arab journalists.</LD>
<LD>   Bin Laden "is alive and in Afghanistan," Omar was quoted as
saying. "Osama helped us during the war with the Russians, he would
not leave us now."</LD>
<TE>   The newspaper, which gave no details of Omar's whereabouts, could
not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   It quoted Omar, who fought the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in
the 1980s and led the Taliban to power in the 1990s, as saying "the
holy war is only just beginning."</TE>
<TE>   "The fire from this war will reach America, and it will burn the
capital that launched an unjust attack on Muslims," he was quoted as
saying.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Renews Hunt for Rwandan War Crimes Suspects</HD>
<DH>Africa: Tycoon Felicien Kabuga is first target of a
campaign that includes rewards and a task force.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>In the months preceding Rwanda's 1994 genocide, Felicien Kabuga
imported thousands of hoes, machetes and a variety of other garden
implements to use as weapons to kill hundreds of thousands of ethnic
Tutsis and moderate Hutus, authorities say.</LD>
<LD>   The powerful businessman also funded radio advertisements that
urged fellow ethnic Hutus to wipe out the entire Tutsi race,
according to U.N. war crimes investigators.</LD>
<LD>   Eight years later, the 66-year-old Kabuga is still on the run,
bouncing from European cities to capitals in Africa. On Wednesday,
the U.S. special envoy for war crimes announced a renewed campaign,
including a specialized task force and rewards of up to $5 million,
to hunt down Kabuga and other alleged architects of the massacre of
more than 800,000 people in the Central African nation.</LD>
<TE>   "While they are fugitives of justice, they can run but they cannot
hide," said Pierre-Richard Prosper, the U.S. ambassador at large for
war crimes issues. "We are now in pursuit."</TE>
<TE>   Prosper, a former Los Angeles federal prosecutor, said the
Nairobi-based campaign to nab Kabuga and his cohorts showed that the
United States was moving into hiding spots of people who committed
crimes against humanity.</TE>
<TE>   In Kenya, Prosper got assurances from top law enforcement
officials, including Atty. Gen. Amos Wako, that they would support
the U.S. efforts. Kenya has been accused of helping to harbor Kabuga
and other Rwandan war criminals.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday night, Prosper and a team of U.S. officials including
Jendayi E. Frazer, President Bush's advisor on African affairs,
traveled to Rome where they were scheduled to meet with Joseph
Kabila, president of Congo.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators with the U.N. International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda believe Kabila's support is essential in bringing to justice
some top planners of the Rwandan genocide, who now live in Congo.</TE>
<TE>   Rwanda has insisted that its soldiers and Congolese rebels they
support will not pull out of eastern Congo until Kabila's government
stops supporting Hutu militias that participated in the genocide.</TE>
<TE>   Prosper said he plans to tell Kabila, who is attending the U.N.
World Food Summit in Rome, that the issue of Rwandan war criminals
has to be resolved before peace can return to Congo.</TE>
<TE>   Kabuga, according to Prosper, is among the most wanted suspects in
the Rwandan war crimes.</TE>
<TE>   With a vast empire that included tea estates, transport companies,
a flour factory and numerous other business, he was considered
Rwanda's wealthiest businessman until the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic
Front (RPF) army overthrew the Hutu government in July 1994, halting
100 days of genocide.</TE>
<TE>   Kabuga belonged to the akazu, or little house, an elite group of
Hutus who saw their grip on power threatened by advancing Tutsi
rebels, according to U.N. investigators.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. indictment alleges that Kabuga used his riches to fund
Hutu militias that butchered Tutsis and moderate Hutus. His money
also supported Radio Mille Collines, which called on Hutus to fill
mass graves with the bodies of Tutsis.</TE>
<TE>   After the RPF entered Kigali, the Rwandan capital, Kabuga fled to
Switzerland, where he deposited a large portion of his fortune,
according to reports by investigators and observers. He later moved
to other countries and continued to elude war crimes investigators.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the U.S. government's Reward for Justice program,
which offers large sums of money for information leading to the
arrest of war crimes suspects, announced that it was willing to pay
up to $5 million to learn the whereabouts of genocide suspects.</TE>
<TE>   The offer failed to reap immediate success, so the United States
decided to revitalize its campaign with wanted posters and fresh
announcements that tipsters could benefit from millions of dollars.
This week, advertisements bearing Kabuga's picture appeared in daily
newspapers here in Kenya.</TE>
<TE>   Prosper said investigators believe that Kabuga has frequented
Nairobi and other Kenyan cities.</TE>
<TE>   International Crisis Group, a highly respected Brussels-based
think tank, published a report last year accusing top Kenyan
government officials of helping to protect Kabuga from arrest.</TE>
<TE>   The investigators traced Kabuga to houses owned by the nephew of
Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi, according to the think tank. After
searching one of the houses, investigators found a handwritten note
suggesting that a Kenyan police officer had tipped off Kabuga,urging
him to flee, according to the group's report.</TE>
<TE>   Kenyan officials have denied sheltering any genocide suspects.
Wako, the attorney general who on Wednesday shared a dais with
Prosper, said Kabuga had previously eluded local police.</TE>
<TE>   Francois Grignon, International Crisis Group's director for
Central Africa, said that since the Sept. 11 attacks, Kenyan
authorities have cooperated "more fully" with the U.S. war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "Kenya now knows that the U.S. is actively counting on its
support," Grignon said. The new campaign "is going to put more
pressure on Kenyan authorities, and the government of the Congo, to
deliver."</TE>

<HD>NBA Eyes China's Rare Ming</HD>
<DH>Shanghai player is 21 years old, 7 feet 5 and talented. But
meeting Chinese demands will be a tall order for the U.S. team that
drafts him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LUSHAN, China</DL>
<LD>Watch out, America. A Chinese kid might be on his way to rock your
basketball world.</LD>
<LD>   He stands 7 feet 5 in his bare feet. (Shaquille O'Neal? A
diminutive 7 feet 1.) And he once shot a three-pointer over Michael
Jordan.</LD>
<LD>   Some in the National Basketball Assn. love his height and his
potential so much, they expect him to become this year's top draft
pick. He would be among a handful of foreigners to reach that stature
in the world's premier basketball league.</LD>
<TE>   You might say it's the dawning of the Ming Dynasty. The reign of
Yao Ming, a 21-year-old native of Shanghai.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, there remains some skepticism.</TE>
<TE>   After watching Yao at an NBA-sponsored practice this year, some
scouts questioned whether the young man with the nice shooting touch
could transition to the faster, rougher NBA game.</TE>
<TE>   But it's a gamble some teams seem willing to make.</TE>
<TE>   "In one national game, he shot 21 times and made 21. How often do
you hear that?" said Carroll Dawson, the general manager of the
Houston Rockets, winner of this year's first pick in the June 26
draft, who have indicated that they are serious about drafting Yao.</TE>
<TE>   But all good things come with a price.</TE>
<TE>   This once-in-a-generation basketball prodigy is no mere athlete.
He is China's national treasure, a symbol of growing Chinese
status--and a priceless bargaining chip.</TE>
<TE>   Any team that wants Yao in its uniform must first duke it out with
the Communist sports machinery.</TE>
<TE>   For Americans, it's a crash course on the vast cultural difference
between the capitalist assumptions of U.S. professional sports and
the paternalistic power of the Chinese state.</TE>
<TE>   For the Chinese, it's a golden opportunity to flex their
diplomatic muscle and remind the world that China's got what everyone
wants.</TE>
<TE>   "America has Michael Jordan, and China has Yao Ming," said Li
Yaomin, the manager of Yao's current team, the Shanghai Sharks.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were the NBA, I'd give anything for a player like Yao Ming,"
Li said.</TE>
<TE>   Yao's personality, however, seems at odds with such a ferocious
sport.</TE>
<TE>   He used to refuse to dunk because he didn't think that it was
nice. He likes to read ancient history. He hates to show off his
height: The first thing he does when he walks into a room is sit
down, even if it's on his duffel bag.</TE>
<TE>   His looks are equally disarming.</TE>
<TE>   His skull almost scrapes the ceiling in corridors of the modest
Lushan Hotel here, where he stayed last month during a warmup game
with the Chinese national team for upcoming competitions. His size 18
footsteps echo off the walls. But compared with 335-pound Shaq, he's
practically scrawny. And his pensive brow, forlorn stare and graceful
arms give him more the look of a schoolboy in love than a gladiator
in the hard-core world of basketball.</TE>
<TE>   Few dispute that Yao has talent.</TE>
<TE>   But many caution against high expectations. They say Yao will have
to put on some weight--he could stand to add about 30 pounds to his
roughly 300-pound frame--and become accustomed to NBA play before his
talents and potential can truly be evaluated.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got incredible skills. For a guy his size, that makes it
more unusual.... He's really coordinated," said Mitch Kupchak, Laker
general manager. "But the No. 1 concern is that he needs a lot of
work on his upper body."</TE>
<TE>   Former NBA star Bill Walton has described Yao in terms of
potential, which he called "huge."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Larry Brown of the Philadelphia 76ers said of the Chinese
standout: "In four years, he could be one of the best players in the
world."</TE>
<TE>   Money Matters</TE>
<TE>   If Yao is picked first, the NBA's rookie salary structure could
pay him about $12 million over three years, plus endorsements. That's
a big raise from the $70,000 a year he earns now. But according to
NBA rules, Yao's home team is only entitled to a transfer fee of
$350,000.</TE>
<TE>   That is not what China is expecting.</TE>
<TE>   The central government is demanding 50% of Yao's earnings and
endorsement income--for the rest of his career. Yao must then split
the remaining half with the Sharks, his coaches and his agents.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, the Sharks want the NBA team that signs Yao to
supply training camps in the U.S., coaching help and NBA-level
American players to help them become the Lakers of China.</TE>
<TE>   "In the U.S., parents spend money to train athletes," Li said. "In
China, the state pays for everything. We feed him, we dress him, and
we house him. When a child grows up, he must take care of his mother.
There's nothing strange about that."</TE>
<TE>   So for the Rockets, a lucky draw has turned into an international
gamble.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all rather new and very interesting," Dawson said before
he left for China this week to hash things out face to face.
"Basketball-wise, that's a slam dunk. He's got finesse, he's got
strength, he's got scoring capacity. His athletic ability and his
size are outstanding. He makes everybody play better. That's the kind
of man we want."</TE>
<TE>   Politically, it's still a bit up in the air.</TE>
<TE>   A breakthrough appeared possible this week after two days of
meetings in Shanghai: The Sharks said they would allow Yao to go to
the NBA. But they won't sign any agreement with the Rockets, or
confirm the final conditions, until the Rockets draft Yao later this
month in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "What if they don't choose him? Then we would have signed a
contract for nothing," Li said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockets still need further approvals from sports authorities
in Beijing, the Chinese capital, including working out details
allowing Yao to return home to help China with international
competitions.</TE>
<TE>   Even when a deal is reached, everything is subject to change in
China. So technically, the Rockets could yet walk away empty-handed.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese make tough negotiators. They know the NBA's weak
spots--a dearth of really big players and a shrinking domestic
audience. China offers a star center with the rare combination of a
giant's size and a little guy's skill. The country also boasts 300
million hoop fans and 1.3 billion potential television viewers and
customers of sports gear. It doesn't get more enticing than that.</TE>
<TE>   The Sharks turned down the NBA last year when the team needed Yao
to help win the national championship. He did. That put the Sharks in
an even better bargaining position.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope they don't price him out of the market," said Billy
Hunter, executive director of the National Basketball Players Assn.
"The question is the ultimate cost. Even if an agreement could be
made, we'll have to wait and see how well he performs in the league.</TE>
<TE>   "Basketball doesn't get better than in the NBA. He's going to be
encountered with the likes of Shaquille O'Neal, Alonzo Mourning and
Dikembe Mutombo. They're really going to test Yao Ming's mettle."</TE>
<TE>   There are several cases of top picks who couldn't make it in the
NBA. Still, few other draft picks have come with this much mystery
and uncertainty.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the simplest thing to explain about Yao is his height. His
parents were basketball players. His father is 6 feet 10, and his
mother is 6-4. He played for the Shanghai team, and she was captain
of the Chinese national women's team. His grandfather, a retired
factory worker, is 6-8.</TE>
<TE>   "My parents would probably prefer for me to go to college and play
basketball only as a hobby," Yao said in his calm baritone at last
month's warmup game here in this central Chinese mountain retreat. "I
like history and archeology. I wish I could visit Egypt."</TE>
<TE>   'Maybe It's Fate'</TE>
<TE>   But in a country's where the nation's interest precedes one's own,
basketball could be Yao's only calling. "Maybe it's fate," Yao said,
but he wouldn't elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   He's not allowed to. He is on loan to the Chinese national team
for the upcoming Asia Games and the World Basketball Championship for
Men. His Beijing handlers have ordered him to avoid the media and the
subject of the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   But watching him dominate the game in China, it's obvious that
he's exhausted the local competition and itching to move on.</TE>
<TE>   "He's unstoppable when he gets close to the basket," said Tab
Baldwin, coach of the New Zealand national team, which lost to the
Chinese in a game here. "He was able to move through people. Once he
gets more strength in his upper body, he'll be an outstanding NBA
player, possibly an All-Star in two or three years."</TE>
<TE>   For now, not even Yao's parents are sure how things will work out
for their only child.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what's going to happen. It's up to our country,"
Yao's father, Zhiyuan, said in Shanghai. "My hope is he can go to the
NBA, improve his skills and come back to serve his country."</TE>
<TE>   At the Shanghai sports schools where Yao spent most of his life,
it's clear that the making of a basketball legend is no family
affair.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese basketball remains a relic of the country's
planned-economy days. Government scouts comb the nation's elementary
schools looking for children with above-average height. They enroll
them in after-school programs to see how they develop. They move the
most promising into full-time sports academies. Some join the junior
division of the local basketball team.</TE>
<TE>   The very best leap to the adult league. The teams now are run by
clubs but still funded by the government. The Sharks, for example,
are backed by a state-owned Shanghai TV station.</TE>
<TE>   Slow Beginnings</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't like basketball very much in the beginning,"
acknowledged Li Zhangming, who was Yao's first coach, when he was 9
years old. "He was so much taller than the other kids and an awkward
mover. It took time to cultivate his interest, by playing games and
making him feel the fun of basketball."</TE>
<TE>   But since Yao's first contact with the sport, no Chinese coach has
treated him as an ordinary talent. By looking at his parents and
X-raying his huge hands, they knew how tall he was going to be.</TE>
<TE>   "There are now plenty of Chinese over 6 feet tall," said Wang Qun,
another Shanghai coach who watched Yao grow up. "But there's only a
small handful in a billion Chinese who are over 7 feet."</TE>
<TE>   The other two, part of China's "Walking Great Wall" trio, are
already in the NBA. But Dallas' Wang Zhizhi and Denver's Menk Bateer
are somewhat shorter and older, no comparison to Yao in potential
drawing or earning power.</TE>
<TE>   To make sure the 9-year-old Yao didn't skip training, coach Li
picked the boy up from school every day and rode his bicycle beside
him to the gym. While other kids paid 70 cents for a school meal, a
high price in the 1980s, Yao got a free lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Government scouts considered him such a rare find, they wanted to
keep an eye on him 24 hours a day. So they persuaded his parents to
enroll him in Shanghai's elite sports academy as early as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "He was only 12 but already 6-5," coach Wang said. "We knew he
would keep growing. We didn't trust the lower-level sports schools.
We wanted him here so our specialists could make sure he got enough
to eat and sleep and that his bones were growing properly."</TE>
<TE>   Food was a big part of his royal treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody else ate in the cafeteria, but Yao ate in a special
kitchen reserved for champions," Wang said. "Only Olympics and world
competition winners could eat there."</TE>
<TE>   Ask him if he would make his own children play basketball, Yao
grimaced and said, "Basketball is too bitter." Then he doubled back
to add, "That's too far down the road to think about. I'm still a
child myself."</TE>
<TE>   Yao won't blame the sport for robbing him of a normal childhood.
But he has plenty of sympathizers back at his old sports school.</TE>
<TE>   "I was picked out of a lineup in second grade," said Ji Bing, 14,
who is 6 feet 1. "I didn't even know what basketball was."</TE>
<TE>   Like other tall Chinese children, Bing has been shooting hoops
every day, including Saturdays and summer vacations, since he was a
small boy.</TE>
<TE>   "Even during our day off, we have to jump rope at home and get our
parents' signature to prove it," Bing said. "But none of us will ever
be as tall as Yao Ming."</TE>
<TE>   Legions of young fans across the country can't wait to see their
idol conquer the NBA. They believe there is no question that he will.</TE>
<TE>   "He is so tall and so handsome, he is our Prince Charming," Chen
Chen, 16, gushed during the game here against the New Zealanders. "If
he goes to the NBA, he'll be in basketball heaven."</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, there's still a roommate and an extra long cot waiting
for him back at the Sharks' third-floor dorm.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't approve, he doesn't go," said Li, the Sharks' boss.</TE>

<HD>Bush Considers Plan for Interim Palestinian State</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Controversial idea is among options White House
will look at to draft a peace proposal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration is debating whether to push for a provisional
Palestinian state as an interim solution to break the deadlock in the
Middle East peace process, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials acknowledged that the idea is virtually certain to
spark controversy among Israelis, Palestinians and the wider Arab
world for a host of reasons. These include Israeli concerns that such
a step would, in essence, reward Palestinian violence against the
Jewish state. Arabs, meanwhile, are likely to worry that creation of
a provisional Palestinian state would stall movement toward a
permanent one.</LD>
<LD>   The White House hastened to note that the idea is just one of
several on the table on the eve of the administration's discussion
about how to proceed in reviving the peace process. President Bush is
to huddle with his national security team Friday to begin charting a
course in advance of an international conference that the State
Department hopes to hold as soon as next month.</LD>
<TE>   The idea came to light as witnesses reported that Israeli troops
had pulled out of the West Bank city of Ramallah, ending a two-day
blockade of Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   The weight given to the idea of a transitional Palestinian state
was underscored when Powell talked about it in an interview published
Wednesday in a leading Arab-language newspaper, Al Hayat, based in
London.</TE>
<TE>   The administration is committed to the creation of a new state,
Palestine, which Bush first broached in a speech at the U.N. last
fall and mentioned again April 4.</TE>
<TE>   But because of the chasm between Israel and the Palestinians over
how to achieve that, the State Department is working on the concept
of an interim state that, though not yet spelled out, would provide a
more formal government structure for Palestinians but defer
settlement of the three major disputes. These are the borders of a
new state, the status of Jerusalem--which both sides claim as their
capital--and the return of Palestinian refugees.</TE>
<TE>   Bush "knows that to get to that vision [of a Palestinian state],
it may be necessary to have a provisional state, an interim step. It
may take several steps to get there," Powell told Al Hayat.</TE>
<TE>   The idea has gained some ground, according to one well-placed U.S.
official, because it could prove one of the few means of
accomplishing often-conflicting goals. First, it could give the
Palestinians hope and undermine extremists without having to deal
with the thorny issues that have prevented a final settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "You create a provisional state so that you have something in the
very near future that the Palestinian people can see as a step on the
way toward the settlement of this in a comprehensive way, something
they can put their hopes in ... something the international community
can invest in with some confidence," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, it might buy time for the Palestinian Authority to implement
major reforms--which in turn could weaken Arafat's singular hold on
the group's power and bring a new generation of leaders into a more
democratic government before a formal state is born, said the
well-placed U.S. official, who asked to remain anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   Powell pointedly noted that the provisional state would have to
demonstrate "good governance," establish effective security
organizations and stamp out corruption.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can put all of that in that kind of a state, it will
become more efficient and it will help us develop the confidence that
is needed between [Israel and the Palestinians] to move forward," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   A provisional state could also serve as the vehicle for
introducing the formal mechanisms of a nation, including a
constitution, a national assembly and an independent judiciary,
according to State Department officials.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of a provisional state is likely to spark sharp questions
from Arabs, and perhaps outright opposition from Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has vehemently opposed any movement on
political issues without an end to Palestinian violence against
Israelis--which he blames on Arafat. Sharon stressed this position in
talks with Bush on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Arabs, meanwhile, would need assurances that Israelis will not
treat the provisional state as the final one and start building
security fences around it, said the well-placed U.S. official.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials acknowledge that they have their own concerns about
the concept.</TE>
<TE>   "An interim state is a flawed idea," said a State Department
official who asked to remain anonymous. "The problem is coming up
with something better."</TE>
<TE>   A top Palestinian official also responded coolly to the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what [Powell] means by that," senior Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat told Associated Press. "The main thing here is
to end the Israeli occupation and to have Israel withdraw" to its old
borders.</TE>
<TE>   Bush will meet today with the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud
al Faisal.</TE>
<TE>   Faisal wants to ensure that the U.S. keeps its focus on finding a
political settlement to the conflict--countering Sharon's efforts to
emphasize security issues first.</TE>

<HD>Beijing Newspaper Retreats, Apologizes for Capitol Gaffe</HD>
<DH>Media: After originally refusing, it retracts its report
that U.S. Congress threatened to leave its digs unless a modern
replacement was built.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>After initially refusing to run a retraction, this city's most
popular newspaper has apologized to readers for an erroneous report
that U.S. lawmakers were threatening to pull out of Washington unless
a fancy new Capitol was built.</LD>
<LD>   The state-run Beijing Evening News admitted in its Tuesday edition
that it had been snookered by a story published by the Onion, the
American publication known for its spoofs of current events. The
Onion reported last month that members of Congress were pressing for
construction of a brand-new Capitol, complete with a retractable dome
and luxury boxes, in order "to stay competitive."</LD>
<LD>   Last week, the Beijing Evening News rehashed the item as a real
news story, without citing its source.</LD>
<TE>   But after "our reporter in Washington checked out [the story], he
discovered that some of its contents were identical to the Onion's
joke article," the Beijing tabloid said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   It added that the quotes in the story were fake, such as an
alleged remark by Speaker of the House Dennis J. Hastert (R-Ill.)
that the Capitol was past its prime.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. Capitol has 200 years of history and is a precious part
of America's cultural heritage," the Evening News quoted unnamed
congressional staffers as saying this week. "It's impossible that it
should be torn down on a whim."</TE>
<TE>   Besides acknowledging its own lapse in judgment, however, the
paper also criticized the Onion, apparently still not fully aware of
the publication's mission as a purveyor of satire and laughs.</TE>
<TE>   "Some small American newspapers frequently fabricate offbeat news
to trick people into noticing them, with the aim of making money,"
the paper said. "This is what the Onion does."</TE>
<TE>   It cited a recent Onion article about the U.S. government issuing
life jackets to all Americans for some unexplained reason. "According
to congressional workers, the Onion is a publication that never
ceases making up false reports," the Evening News said.</TE>
<TE>   The Beijing paper's Capitol gaffe was picked up by Western media
and widely reported.</TE>
<TE>   At first, the international news editor, Yu Bin, ruled out a
correction, challenging a Times reporter to prove that the story was
false.</TE>
<TE>   But Tuesday's mea culpa conceded that a lack of vigilance had
resulted in the publication of "factual inconsistencies."</TE>
<TE>   "We are open to our readers' criticism, and we apologize," said
the tabloid, which has a circulation of 1 million.</TE>

<HD>Ex-CEO Is Accused of Insider Trading</HD>
<DH>XXXX</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON and DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The former chief executive of biotechnology company ImClone Systems
Inc. was arrested early Wednesday on charges of violating
insider-trading laws--marking the most prominent such case in years
and further sullying corporate America's image.</LD>
<LD>   Samuel Waksal, 54, who stepped down last month amid deepening
questions about his family's trading of ImClone stock, was accused of
tipping off two relatives to impending bad news about the company's
top drug prospect.</LD>
<LD>   Waksal was arrested at his loft in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood
at 6:30 a.m. by FBI agents. He was later freed on a $10-million bond,
co-signed by Harlan Waksal, his brother, who succeeded him as
ImClone's CEO.</LD>
<TE>   The arrest came a day before a scheduled congressional
subcommittee hearing on alleged insider trading at ImClone, in
particular by Samuel Waksal. A subcommittee of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee also will look into stock trading by Harlan
Waksal, a spokesman for the committee said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In a complaint filed by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan,
prosecutors allege that Samuel Waksal got word of an adverse decision
by the Food and Drug Administration about the company's experimental
cancer drug Erbitux. He allegedly leaked the information to two
people--not named in the complaint--who immediately sold shares that
were worth $10.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Samuel Waksal tried to sell almost 80,000 of his ImClone shares
but was blocked by two brokerage firms that demanded the company's
approval, the complaint alleges.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy surrounding Waksal includes businesswoman Martha
Stewart, a close friend of his.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart sold almost 4,000 ImClone shares the day before the FDA
announcement, but she maintained Wednesday that she had no privileged
information and did nothing wrong. Stewart was not charged in the
U.S. attorney's complaint and was not identified by the committee as
a focus of its investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The charges are the latest in a series of disturbing events
involving corporate America and some of its most visible executives.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive of
conglomerate Tyco International, was charged with evading sales
taxes. That followed mounting financial scandals at companies such as
Enron Corp. and Global Crossing Ltd., as well as broad criticism of
Wall Street stock analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas recent instances of wrongdoing centered on alleged
accounting and corporate financial chicanery, the cases involving
Tyco and ImClone have top executives accused of pursuing their own
financial well-being at the expense of taxpayers or shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone was the toast of the biotechnology industry a year ago,
based on expectations surrounding Erbitux, a colon cancer drug. To
celebrate the drug's potential, the Waksals threw a party at an
industry conference last spring at which revelers were entertained by
the Doobie Brothers. The company predicted that Erbitux would reach
the market this year and have sales of $1.5 billion by 2005--a
prospect that today appears highly unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   The scandals have taken a toll on the stock market, with the
current downturn blamed partly on investor distrust of large
companies. Some experts fear that such sentiment could dent the
fledgling economic recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "The significance of this case was that Samuel Waksal was a CEO of
a public company and he held a very powerful position, and he
exploited this position," said Helene T. Glotzer, assistant regional
director of the New York office of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which filed parallel civil charges against Waksal. "I
don't think there's much more that can undermine investor confidence
than conduct like this."</TE>
<TE>   Samuel Waksal was charged with six counts of securities fraud, two
counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and one count of
perjury for allegedly lying to SEC investigators.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, Waksal would face a maximum of 10 years in prison
for each of the securities fraud counts and five years each for the
conspiracy and perjury counts. He also could be liable for monetary
penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys Mark Pomerantz and Lewis Liman said in a statement that
the evidence against their client was "entirely circumstantial."</TE>
<TE>   "The government misread that evidence and it overreacted in
deciding to make today's arrest," the statement said. Waksal "looks
forward to the opportunity to defend" himself.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of his release, Waksal's travel is restricted to
portions of New York state. By Friday, he must put up $5 million in
cash and get signatures from two people willing to co-sign the bond.
Prosecutors alleged in their complaint that Waksal had more than $80
million in debts and owed payments of more than $800,000 a month.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Magistrate Frank Maas in New York signed a waiver Wednesday
evening allowing Waksal to travel to Washington to testify at today's
hearing. The Justice Department sought the waiver at the behest of
the committee, chaired by W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.).</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the committee said that if Waksal failed to
attend, he would be held in contempt of Congress. But Scott
Tagliarino, a spokesman for Waksal, said the former chief executive
planned to appear.</TE>
<TE>   Also expected to appear were Harlan Waksal and Brian Markison, a
vice president of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., the big drug maker that
invested $2 billion  in ImClone last fall to acquire marketing rights
to Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   A source close to the Waksal family said attorneys for Samuel
Waksal had discussed a voluntary surrender to the Justice Department
and had no indication, until his arrest, that it had been ruled out.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint alleges that Samuel Waksal learned Dec. 26 that the
FDA would soon notify the New York-based company that it would refuse
to consider ImClone's application to market Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   That night, the complaint says, Waksal tipped off the first
person, who sold 135,000 shares during the next two days. On the
morning of Dec. 27, Waksal allegedly informed the second person, who
promptly sold 39,472 ImClone shares.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA faxed ImClone a letter rejecting the company's request
about 4 p.m. Dec. 28, the SEC complaint says. ImClone announced the
news at 6 p.m. By the end of the next trading day, its shares had
sunk 16% from $55.25 to $46.46 on Nasdaq. They closed Wednesday at
$7.83, up 28 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Tauzin's committee is reviewing evidence that Harlan
Waksal sold 700,000 shares at $72 each--or about $50 million--of
ImClone stock Dec. 6, two days after learning from an employee that
the FDA might reject the company's Erbitux application.</TE>
<TE>   Committee spokesman Ken Johnson said that on Dec. 4, Lily Lee,
ImClone vice president of regulatory affairs, met with FDA officials
to discuss the company's application to market the cancer drug. At
some point in the meeting, Johnson said, Lee got "bad vibes" and
asked whether the FDA planned to reject the company's application to
market the drug.</TE>
<TE>   An FDA official told Lee that such an outcome was possible, and
Lee passed that information on to Harlan Waksal, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said the sequence of events "raises serious questions"
about what Harlan Waksal knew and whether it affected his decision to
sell ImClone stock.</TE>
<TE>   Harlan Waksal was unavailable for comment Wednesday. His attorney,
Carl H. Loewenson Jr., had no comment on the details of the
allegation.</TE>
<TE>   But he said: "Harlan Waksal has testified at the SEC and answered
all of their questions. He has not received a Wells notice, and he
will answer all questions put to him by the subcommittee."</TE>
<TE>   A Wells notice is a document from the SEC that informs targets
that the agency plans to file a lawsuit against it.</TE>
<TE>   A person familiar with the investigation said a rejection was one
of three outcomes described to Lee at the Dec. 4 meeting with the
FDA. According to the source, the agency told Lee that the
application otherwise could be accepted or delayed.</TE>
<TE>   "It is like coming to a stoplight," the source said. "It can be
red, green or yellow."</TE>
<TE>   The timing of Harlan Waksal's stock sale was coincidental, said a
source familiar with the situation. Harlan Waksal told the company's
board of directors in a memo Oct. 31 that he planned to sell a large
block of shares to pay taxes. He had incurred a large tax bill by
exercising options earlier in the year and by selling a large number
of shares to Bristol-Myers when the company bought its 20% stake in
ImClone.</TE>
<TE>   The sale was delayed until Dec. 6 by several factors, the source
said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Abigail Goldman in Los Angeles contributed to
this report.</TE>

triggered spontaneous, raucous and sometimes unruly celebrations in
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   At Staples Center, where more than 18,000 fans paid $10 each to
watch the game on wide-screen televisions, the victory brought a
deafening din and some minor vandalism, but nothing compared to the
melee that greeted the Lakers' championship two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   As people left the downtown arena, a few set bonfires and began
leaping over the flames. Near the 11th Street entrance, police
officers fired concussion rounds, scattering people in every
direction. Some of the 300 or so rowdy fans confronting police
uprooted trees and knocked over news racks.</TE>
<TE>   Scores screamed obscene chants at the police, who moved in
formation to disperse the crowds. At least two people were arrested,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "We were a little disappointed," LAPD Cmdr. Gary Brennan said. "I
expected them to be a little more behaved."</TE>
<TE>   Some fans broke windows of television news vans. At one point,
when someone outside Staples set fire to a shirt, police shot foam
bullets at the crowd. Many, including people in wheelchairs, began
backing up and trying to take cover.</TE>
<TE>   Most fans celebrated loudly but civilly, not just at Staples but
at homes, bars, restaurants, fitness clubs and other places
throughout the region.</TE>
<TE>   Omar Lang watched the game at a restaurant in Newport Beach owned
by former Laker Dennis Rodman. It was Lang's 25th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "It was awesome. I want to cry. The Lakers win, and it's my
birthday," he said as the game ended.</TE>
<TE>   In the final seconds, inside Staples, fans stopped watching and
simply started screaming, "Three-peat! Three-peat!" Confetti, Krispy
Kreme napkins and rolls of toilet paper flew through the air.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the kind of stuff you see on TV," said fan David Perry.
"This is the real L.A."</TE>
<TE>   The victory and the championship series were historic on many
fronts, and cemented O'Neal's reputation as one of the most
dominating players ever. He won his third straight Most Valuable
Player award in an NBA Finals, joining Michael Jordan as the only
player to win three straight Finals MVPs.</TE>
<TE>   The victory also meant that the Lakers had done something not
realized since they moved to Los Angeles from Minneapolis 42 years
ago: win three consecutive titles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a blessing," player Kobe Bryant said of his team.</TE>
<TE>   Laker owner Jerry Buss said he had moments in past years when he
doubted whether the team could do it, but on Wednesday he lamented
only that more fans couldn't witness the game firsthand.</TE>
<TE>   "To build another championship team like this, I'm so proud of
this I cannot even tell you," Buss said. "It's just a shame we
couldn't win on our own home floor."</TE>
<TE>   Plans call for a victory parade Friday beginning at 11:30 a.m.
near City Hall and proceeding on Figueroa Street to Staples Center,
where a rally will begin about 12:50 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The only other teams to win three consecutive NBA championships
are the Chicago Bulls, who did it twice behind Michael Jordan, and
the Boston Celtics, who won a remarkable eight straight
championships--five of them over the Lakers--from 1958 to 1966. The
Minneapolis Lakers were the first team to win three straight
championships, dominating the league from 1951-54.</TE>
<TE>   Before Wednesday's game, tickets to watch inside Staples Center
were being purchased from scalpers for as much as $50, some $40 above
the regular price. As soon as the game began, a four-block area
around Staples Center became a "secure zone," where cars and people
without tickets were not allowed to cross.</TE>
<TE>   Almost everyone in and around Staples was wearing a
uniform--either Laker purple and gold or LAPD blue. Officials said
about 1,000 police officers were on game duty throughout the city.
About 600 were in and around Staples Center, but another large
contingent was in the Crenshaw area, where problems with rowdy
cruisers and even shootings had in the past marred championship
celebrations.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Capt. Charlie Beck said the department established a heavy
police presence leading up to the championship clincher to set "a
standard of conduct."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great help," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, after the Lakers defeated the Indiana Pacers in
Game 6 at home, thousands of fans who had been watching on a giant
television screen outside Staples Center went on a melee, setting
bonfires, overturning cars, tossing garbage cans and smashing windows
for several blocks around the arena. Damage was estimated at more
than $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   There was no violence last year, when the Lakers won the
championship by defeating the Philadelphia 76ers in Philadelphia. As
they did this year, the Lakers allowed fans to watch on TV inside
Staples, and the celebration afterward was mostly orderly--and
supervised by a huge LAPD deployment.</TE>
<TE>   This year's championship series lacked some of the drama of those
past, and some Laker fans said it was beginning to feel routine. "But
there's still a lot of excitement," said Jeff Conn, 17, who bought a
new Laker cap and other purple and gold accessories at a Laker store
at Staples earlier Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   At McMurphy's Irish Pub in Old Pasadena, fans drifted in to watch
the game on 12 TVs. Nelson Amaya, 25, of Highland Park, was dressed
for the occasion in a Kobe Bryant jersey, but admitted that the game
lacked drama.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no competition in this game," he said. "But it's
definitely exciting because of the three-peat. It's the weight of it.
It's history in the making."</TE>
<TE>   Alan Fey, Staples Center's director of marketing, said sales of
Lakers gear have been "trending higher" compared to last year.</TE>
<TE>   Though he wouldn't give specifics, Fey said sales in the store and
in kiosks inside the arena are up between 10% and 20% this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually, when teams have a high level of success, there's a level
of complacency," Fey said. "But Lakers fans are great, we always do
really well here."</TE>
<TE>   Halfway across town at the Triple-A Flag and Banner Store, Vice
President Craig Furst said that although his sales of Laker car flags
and banners have fallen off, he doesn't think fans' enthusiasm has.
The company has a contract for Laker banners at Staples Center, but
also sells car flags and banners at 10 retail outlets.</TE>
<TE>   "We've sold several thousand flags and at least a couple of
thousand banners," Furst said.</TE>
<TE>   Furst attributed the difference to more competition from street
vendors, but the one hawking shirts and flags in a parking lot at
30th Street and Crenshaw said his business has fallen off too.</TE>
<TE>   "It's subsided a little," said Warren, whose unlicensed wares made
him reluctant to give a last name. "People have lost a little
enthusiasm because [the Lakers] are winning all the time."</TE>

DiMassa, Jessica Garrison, Jeff Gottlieb, Richard Marosi, Bob Pool,

<HD>Latino Voter Lawsuit Rejected</HD>
<DH>Redistricting: U.S. panel upholds congressional and
legislative remap. Aggressive safeguards are no longer needed, judges
say, because discrimination is easing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG and MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Discrimination against Latinos in Southern California elections has
shrunk to the point that they no longer require the most aggressive
forms of protection under the federal Voting Rights Act, a
three-judge federal district court panel ruled Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The judges dismissed a lawsuit brought by the Mexican American
Legal Defense and Educational Fund challenging parts of the
redistricting plan for congressional and state legislative seats
adopted by the Legislature after the 2000 census.</LD>
<LD>   The suit charged that district lines in the San Fernando Valley,
the southern part of Los Angeles County and part of San Diego County
reduced the ability of Latinos to be elected to office by creating
districts that were not majority Latino.</LD>
<TE>   Under the ruling, those districts will remain in place until after
the next census in 2010.</TE>
<TE>   "It is certainly not our view that racial discrimination no longer
affects our political institutions or motivates any portion of the
electorate," the judges wrote. But "whites and other non-Latinos are
currently far more willing to support Latino candidates for office
than in the past."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling could have a long-term impact on the drawing of
political boundaries across the region, giving legislatures more
freedom to draw lines without the need to create districts in which
Latinos are an outright majority.</TE>
<TE>   If new political district maps face court challenge, the ruling
could have a persuasive effect on other judges, said Thomas A. Saenz,
MALDEF vice president of litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Large numbers of Latinos now hold senior positions in the
Legislature, and Latino candidates often win elections in districts
with non-Latino majorities, the judges said. That evidence, they
said, shows that at least in Southern California, Latinos can obtain
political power without the need for carefully circumscribed
districts.</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen of 19 Latino members of the Assembly and all seven Latino
state senators voted for the redistricting plan that was challenged
in the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The 91-page opinion was a major defeat for the civil rights groups
that challenged the redistricting plan, in part because the suit was
dismissed without a trial, but also because the ruling was written by
a panel that lawyers considered highly sympathetic to civil rights
claims: Judge Stephen Reinhardt of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals and U.S. District Judges Christina A. Snyder and Margaret M.
Morrow.</TE>
<TE>   If appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, the case would be decided
by justices who in recent years have proven far more hostile to
voting rights claims by minority groups. An appeal would risk making
the ruling a nationwide precedent.</TE>
<TE>   The Voting Rights Act was passed in the 1960s, primarily to
protect black voters who had been shut out of political power in the
South. Over the years, its reach has expanded to other minority
groups whose attempts to secure political power were stopped by
racial-bloc voting.</TE>
<TE>   The "rapidly changing multiracial and multiethnic community that
is present-day Southern California" is a "fundamentally different
context" than the Southern states in which the voting rights law
developed, the judges said.</TE>
<TE>   That ruling amounted to a fundamental change in how the Voting
Rights Act is applied in the region.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen years ago, for example, federal judges found that white
officeholders had gerrymandered the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors to make it difficult for Latinos to win election.</TE>
<TE>   But "this is a very different case," the judges said, noting that
"Latinos are a far more formidable political force than they were in
the 1980s."</TE>
<TE>   The Latino population of Los Angeles County grew 34% between the
1990 and 2000 censuses, and Latinos make up about 46% of the county
population.</TE>
<TE>   That ruling is a "troublesome precedent," said Saenz, because it
"could permit intentional discrimination whenever a minority has
reached a certain modicum of political power." MALDEF must "take into
account what the Supreme Court currently looks like, and what its
track record looks like on issues like this," Saenz said.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Remcho, a lawyer for state Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson
(D-Culver City), said the decision acknowledges the changing nature
of California politics.</TE>
<TE>   "The court recognized that unlike the Southern states that gave
rise to many of the voting rights statutes, California really is a
state in which Latinos have had a chance to participate fully in the
process," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "What the court is saying is, 'Wait a minute. Latinos do have a
chance to elect candidates of their choice in these districts, and
they've had a full chance to participate in this process.' "</TE>
<TE>   As is always the case when legislatures redraw political lines,
last year's redistricting process was an intensely political
exercise.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Legislature sought to protect powerful incumbents,
particularly Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Mission Hills), whose brother,
Michael, directed the process for the Democratic majority.</TE>
<TE>   In its suit, MALDEF charged that the Legislature had violated the
Voting Rights Act by removing thousands of Latino voters from
Berman's district and placed them in a neighboring district
represented by Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks).</TE>
<TE>   Latinos are the largest single group in the newly drawn district,
but are not a majority. Legislators acted in part to protect Berman
against a primary challenge from a Latino opponent, other members of
the Legislature have said.</TE>
<TE>   But the lawmakers had no obligation to create a district with a
Latino majority because even in the district as now drawn, Latino
candidates have a fair shot at winning, the judges ruled.</TE>
<TE>   They cited several recent elections in which Latino candidates
received substantial support from non-Latino voters.</TE>
<TE>   In Berman's district, the judges noted that Rocky Delgadillo,
running for city attorney last year, and Antonio Villaraigosa,
seeking the mayor's job, outpolled their opponents with the help of
non-Latino crossover votes.</TE>
<TE>   In neither of the Los Angeles County districts being challenged
does any ethnic or racial group comprise more than 39.8% of
registered voters, the judges wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "It would therefore be political folly, if not suicide, for a
representative in either district to consider it his primary
obligation to act as a representative of a single racial or ethnic
group," they said.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Berman's district, the judges dismissed MALDEF's claims
regarding the congressional district now held by Rep. Bob Filner
(D-San Diego) and the state Senate seat held by Betty Karnette
(D-Long Beach).</TE>
<TE>   State Senate President Pro Tem John Burton praised the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "It just proves that the redistricting plan is what we've always
said it was--a good plan. It's constitutional in every area. And we
were able to increase representation in the Legislature for Latinos
and women and protect African American members."</TE>
<TE>   J. Morgan Kousser, a redistricting expert who testified in the
case for MALDEF, said, however, that state lawmakers have made it
extremely difficult for a Latino to be elected in the San Fernando
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "Californians are still not colorblind," he said. "You have to
have a substantial portion of the district Latino or a Latino does
not get elected in the vast majority of cases."</TE>

<HD>Records Outline Simon's Role at Collapsed S&amp;L</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From the start of his campaign for governor of California, Republican
nominee Bill Simon Jr. has played down his role in the 1993 collapse
of Western Federal Savings and Loan, a debacle that cost taxpayers
$122 million.</LD>
<LD>   By his account, he had nothing to do with the 1988 purchase of the
Marina del Rey thrift by his family and other investors. By his
account, he served on its board of directors for about a year to
monitor the investment, but was not engaged in "anything to do with
the operation of the thrift."</LD>
<LD>   Court documents and other records, however, show that Simon was
more deeply involved in the downward spiral of Western Federal than
his public statements suggest.</LD>
<TE>   He signed the application for government approval of the S&amp;L
purchase. He served for nearly two years on its 11-member board. For
the next two years, until the government seized the thrift, Simon was
one of five board members at a holding company that owned just one
business: Western Federal.</TE>
<TE>   During Simon's tenure as a Western Federal director, records show,
government regulators rebuked the board for lax supervision of
management. Month after month, S&amp;L monitors alerted Simon and the
other board members to rampant mismanagement on their watch. Lending
practices were "liberal and imprudent," they told the board. Reserves
to cover bad loans were too small. Western Federal used
"inappropriate and misleading" accounting methods that overstated
profits, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Business World of Simon</TE>
<TE>   The full scope of Simon's role at Western Federal is laid out in
documents reviewed by The Times. Among the records are Simon family
correspondence, confidential reports by thrift regulators and
internal Western Federal memos.</TE>
<TE>   They illustrate how Simon, who hopes to govern a state with a
record $23.6-billion budget gap, carried out his responsibilities at
an institution in severe financial distress.</TE>
<TE>   They also provide a rare glimpse into the private business world
of Simon. A central tenet of his campaign is that he was "a
successful businessman," but the vast bulk of his other work at his
family's privately held investment firm is shielded from public view.</TE>
<TE>   Simon was not solely responsible for driving Western Federal into
the ground, as his Democratic opponent, Gov. Gray Davis, has
suggested. Over the course of its decline, the documents show, Simon
was one of many players who tried--and failed--to restore the S&amp;L to
financial health.</TE>
<TE>   "Making Billy the poster boy for the failure of Western Fed is
absolutely ridiculous," said J. Peter Simon, the candidate's brother
and fellow board member. "It's like blaming the sinking of the
Titanic on someone working in the kitchen."</TE>
<TE>   The governor has used the thrift's demise to argue that his
challenger is unqualified to run California. On Monday, Davis
launched a television ad that blames the taxpayer "bailout" of
Western Federal on mismanagement by Simon.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview last week, the Republican nominee acknowledged for
the first time that he was on the Western Federal board for nearly
two years. He denied that he and other board members were "remiss in
their duties and responsibilities," as regulators put it in one 1989
report.</TE>
<TE>   "You had this big thrift crisis nationwide," he said. Regulators
"wanted to make sure that they could never be told that they were not
tough enough. So what they did was they erred on the side of being
overly tough."</TE>
<TE>   The Simons have lashed back at the government, arguing in a
lawsuit against the United States that regulators improperly seized
Western Federal. They blame the losses--both their own and the
taxpayers'--on the government's breach of an agreement struck when
the Simon group bought the S&amp;L.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Emily C. Hewitt of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in
Washington has found that the government did indeed break its word.
But the case is still set to go to trial in September to determine
whether that was Western Federal's undoing.</TE>
<TE>   By filing suit, the Simons invited the government to respond with
its own story of how Western Federal died. The Justice Department, in
court papers, says the Simons and their partners made a bad
investment, then made it worse by retaining executives who mismanaged
the thrift and put it on the path to insolvency. Among those at
fault, it says, were members of the board.</TE>
<TE>   Signed 1988 Application</TE>
<TE>   The first trace of Bill Simon Jr. in the affairs of Western
Federal is his signature on the August 1988 application for
government approval of the purchase. He was one of three people who
signed for the buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Just six months earlier, he and his brother had gone into business
with their father, William E. Simon, the powerful and notoriously
hot-tempered former U.S. Treasury secretary. Simon Jr., then 37, had
left his job as an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan to join
William E. Simon &amp; Sons, the family's new investment firm in New
Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Simon Jr. signed the application to buy the S&amp;L in his role
as president of Alham Inc., a family-owned company named after
Alexander Hamilton, the nation's first Treasury secretary.</TE>
<TE>   "I reviewed the application, I'm sure," Simon said in the
interview.</TE>
<TE>   Simon was listed as the person to whom the government should send
communications with the family. His father put him in charge of
watching the investment. Nevertheless, Simon said he played no part
in the decision to buy Western Federal.</TE>
<TE>   "This was definitely an investment decision that I did not make,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Simons and their partners bought Western Federal for $220
million on Sept. 23, 1988. The Simon family invested $40 million in
the deal, including $11 million from Alham.</TE>
<TE>   "It was dad's deal," said Peter Simon. "Dad wanted to do this."</TE>
<TE>   Their father's ambition was to build a Pacific Rim finance
conglomerate with up to $20 billion in assets, including the $4
billion at Western Federal. Among the Simon group's acquisitions were
Honolulu Federal Savings and Loan and a commercial bank, First
Interstate of Hawaii. Bill Simon Jr. served on the board of directors
of both financial institutions.</TE>
<TE>   At Western Federal, danger signs emerged even before the Simon
group bought the thrift.</TE>
<TE>   Terry M. Crow, the Simon group's chief investment officer,
recalled in an interview that he opposed the acquisition. Western
Federal profits, he warned, relied too heavily on one-time gains from
selling bundles of mortgages on Wall Street. In Crow's view, the
thrift also took too much risk by agreeing to take back mortgages
that later went bad.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't think that's an appropriate way to run your
business," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Government's Incentive</TE>
<TE>   Within the government, the voice of caution was Sidney C. Mar,
then a supervisory agent at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in San
Francisco. He raised the same concerns as Crow--and several others.
Western Federal, he told a fellow regulator in April 1988, would bear
an "extremely high" debt burden and have insufficient reserves to
protect against losses.</TE>
<TE>   But the government had its own incentive to approve the purchase:
As part of the deal, the Simon group would also acquire Bell Savings
and Loan, a sick San Mateo thrift seized by regulators in 1985. The
Simon group would merge Bell, which the government needed to unload,
with Western Federal. In return, the government would cover Bell's
losses.</TE>
<TE>   So despite Mar's concerns, the government approved the application
signed by Simon.</TE>
<TE>   In hindsight, the Simon group could not have picked a worse time
to buy Western Federal.</TE>
<TE>   Within a year of the purchase, the California real estate market
would start its steepest decline since the Great Depression. It was a
poisonous climate for lenders, more so for those engaged in the kind
of high-risk lending that had prompted Crow and Mar to raise red
flags.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Western Federal faced another more sudden--and
devastating--blow: the August 1989 enactment of a federal law
imposing strict new standards on S&amp;Ls.</TE>
<TE>   Overnight, Western Federal would be required to set aside millions
of dollars in reserves. It did not have the money.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it did not even meet the lower requirements in place
before the new law took effect. Regulators had agreed at the time of
the 1988 purchase that they would not enforce those rules. It was one
of the benefits the Simon group got for taking Bell off the
government's hands.</TE>
<TE>   Now, less than a year later, regulators broke the agreement and
enforced the new rules.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Simon said, Western Federal was forced to toss its
business plan "out the window."</TE>
<TE>   "It was really a nightmare," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Western Federal was immediately $14 million short of the capital
it needed.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless we wanted to just hand over the keys, we had to find a way
to work with the new rules," said C. Earl Corkett, then a Western
Federal board member.</TE>
<TE>   The immediate problem: The S&amp;L was crippled in its effort to meet
the "extremely high" debt obligations that Sidney Mar had cautioned
against. Just over the horizon was a $4-million payment that Western
Federal needed to give its holding company so that it could pay a
lender.</TE>
<TE>   But regulators blocked the payment. The reason: It would worsen
the shortage of capital at Western Federal. By the end of August
1989, just two months after Simon joined the S&amp;L board, Western
Federal would notify lenders that prospects for paying debt any time
soon were "doubtful."</TE>
<TE>   Within weeks of Simon's appointment to the board, regulators began
hammering the S&amp;L for more than just its shortage of money. In
scathing examination reports, they described an institution awash in
poor business practices. At the time, the government was putting
thrifts nationwide under tight scrutiny after hundreds of them had
failed.</TE>
<TE>   At Western Federal, the problems started at the top with the board
of directors, whose members were "lax in fulfilling their fiduciary
responsibilities," the Office of Thrift Supervision reported in
August 1989. To regulators, the key step the board needed to take was
to replace Chief Executive Hugh Evans Jr. and his top managers.</TE>
<TE>   Western Federal had lent millions of dollars to unqualified
borrowers without verifying their income, thrift monitors told Simon
and his fellow board members. Managers of the S&amp;L had "committed a
major violation" of a regulator's order to stop making certain kinds
of construction loans. The quality of the commercial real estate
portfolio was poor. Reserves to cover bad loans were running dry.
Aggressive accounting techniques were distorting the thrift's balance
sheet and hiding potential dangers.</TE>
<TE>   In sum, Western Federal was unduly exposing itself to harm in a
bad economy that would hurt even the healthiest thrifts. The panoply
of troubles raised "concerns about management decision-making,"
regulators told the board.</TE>
<TE>   Simon himself reviewed some of the bad loans at Western Federal
headquarters in Marina del Rey, according to Patrick J. McNamara,
then the S&amp;L's executive vice president for branches.</TE>
<TE>   "I just remember him sitting in an office not far from mine
calling for loan files and being upset every time he found out it was
worse than he thought it would be," McNamara said.</TE>
<TE>   In April 1990, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. sent the board
another report citing "severe problems," and once again, the board
itself was a target of criticism.</TE>
<TE>   In a cover letter to Simon and the other members, John R. Sexton,
then FDIC regional director in San Francisco, wrote: "You are
particularly urged to review the section of the report dealing with
supervision by the board, which has not been fully satisfactory."</TE>
<TE>   Regulators' Findings</TE>
<TE>   By law, board members of an S&amp;L must set policies that protect
both stockholders and the taxpayers who insure its deposits.</TE>
<TE>   The FDIC reminded the Western Federal board that it had a legal
duty to "effectively supervise the affairs of the thrift." On the
cover of every examination report, regulators urged Simon and the
other board members to review the findings thoroughly.</TE>
<TE>   In the interview last week, Simon denied responsibility for
supervision of Western Federal managers. "I wouldn't use the word
supervise, personally," he said. "I would use the word evaluate. To
me, evaluation implies something less frequent, more periodic, more
in the normal course of business."</TE>
<TE>   Simon defined his role on the board as simply monitoring his
family's investment. He said it was not the board's job to set
Western Federal's strategic direction.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be very clear what the duty of a board member is," he
said. "It's not necessarily to initiate, craft, establish--those
kinds of things--strategic direction. It really falls generally more
in the line of a collaborative process where you ultimately will be
part of discussions."</TE>
<TE>   During his 22 months on the Western Federal board, Simon left
little impression on some fellow members. One of them, James L.
Loper, could not recall Simon's presence at all--although they served
together the entire 22 months.</TE>
<TE>   Corkett remembered Simon as "a very good listener."</TE>
<TE>   "Bill allowed the rest of the board of directors to carry the
ball," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was just learning the business," said former board member
Richard S. Crowley.</TE>
<TE>   But Preston Martin, a board member close to the Simons, described
the candidate as "very assertive." "It wasn't just because he had
money in it; it was because he'd done his homework," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he had only vague recollections of the concerns raised
in the monitors' reports. Asked how he responded to them, he said, "I
don't know if I was even on the board of the thrift at that point."</TE>
<TE>   He was. Simon served on the board from June 1989 until April 1991,
then on the holding company board from May 1991 to June 1993, when
the S&amp;L collapsed, according to a campaign spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he recalled government letters "saying there could be
some problem loans or whatever it was."</TE>
<TE>   "I remember occasionally thinking, 'Boy, I'll tell you, the OTS is
just--they're tough,' " Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Simon attributed the harsh reports to legal strategy.
Knowing it would face lawsuits for breaking its word on how much
capital Western Federal and other thrifts had to keep in reserve, the
government exaggerated the problems at the S&amp;Ls, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Simon Jr. cast the problems as almost routine.</TE>
<TE>   "I recall a concern that we just needed to be a little tighter in
terms of the way the institution was being run," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The reports challenging CEO Evans piled up for nearly three years
before Western Federal replaced him. Evans said the government was
"the bad guy" for breaking its word, and the real estate slump made
matters worse. He declined to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sad to see him go," Simon said. "He was a good man."</TE>
<TE>   In June 1992, Western Federal hired James A. Bethel as the new
chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   In a court deposition, Simon recalled, "At that point, I was on
the holding company board, and you know it was really a matter for
the thrift, in terms of what they wanted to do. But we would talk. No
question about it."</TE>
<TE>   OTS supervisory agent Darrel W. Dochow later praised Bethel in a
meeting with the Western Federal board. He told the board it was
unfortunate that they had not replaced Evans "a year or two earlier,"
because now it was too late to stop the thrift's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Sale of S&amp;L Is Urged</TE>
<TE>   With the thrift's survival in jeopardy, Simon laid out his
family's options in an October 1992 memo to Bethel. At the top of
Simon's list: Sell Western Federal. But Simon recognized that no
buyer would accept the risks of its bad loans.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unlikely that we could sell the entire company for an
amount in excess of zero," Simon wrote.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, Simon was aghast in early 1993 when regulators
told him who should provide the capital that Western Federal needed
to stay alive: his own family.</TE>
<TE>   "They asked us for 150 million bucks," Simon recalled last week in
the interview.</TE>
<TE>   The Simons responded: "Look, if you think money needs to be put
up, why don't you put it up?"</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, Western Federal asked the government for a
$150-million bailout in March 1993. Seizure by the government would
"destroy the institution" and cost taxpayers up to $1 billion, the
S&amp;L warned in a report.</TE>
<TE>   Even with a government rescue, the outlook was abysmal: Western
Federal projected $180 million in new loan losses over the next three
years. Its thrift rating had sunk to the lowest possible grade, 5,
reserved for thrifts "with an extremely high immediate or near-term
probability of failure."</TE>
<TE>   On June 4, 1993, the Office of Thrift Supervision put Western
Federal into receivership and seized control of its 27 branches. The
government ultimately broke it apart and sold off the pieces.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the takeover of Western Federal cost taxpayers $122
million, said FDIC spokesman David Barr. Depositors lost no money, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   For the Simons, the $40 million they put into Western Federal was
wiped out. To this day, it is their biggest single investment loss.</TE>
<TE>   Simon conceded that Western Federal was "not a success," but in
the context of the governor's race, he cast it nonetheless in a
favorable light.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of running the state," he said, "I think the lesson
you'd have to take away is that Bill Simon is a very diligent person.
Thorough and diligent. Takes his responsibilities seriously."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The witness was Bill Simon Jr.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a witch-hunt mentality," he testified.</LD>
<LD>   "Pardon?" asked Thomas P. Reilly, a U.S. Justice Department
lawyer.</LD>
<TE>   "It was that kind of mentality," Simon replied. "It was a
witch-hunt mentality."</TE>
<TE>   "On the part of the regulators?" Reilly asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   The scene was Simon's deposition in an office on Wilshire
Boulevard. It was 1999, six years after the collapse of Western
Federal Savings and Loan. Simon, now the Republican nominee for
governor of California, and his family lost their entire $40-million
investment in the Marina del Rey thrift.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you mean by 'witch-hunt mentality?' " Reilly asked.</TE>
<TE>   "They always assumed that you were doing something wrong," Simon
testified. "They always assumed that it was guilty until proven
innocent, and it was a tough environment to operate under."</TE>
<TE>   Simon described the government scrutiny as "unbelievably" tight.
"We literally--maybe figuratively--couldn't go to the bathroom
without checking with the regulators," he testified.</TE>
<TE>   Simon recalled with bitterness his occasional meetings with them
during his four years on the boards of the S&amp;L and its holding
company, WestFed Holdings Inc. Government monitors "were telling us
how to run the business," he testified.</TE>
<TE>   "They treated us, honestly, like we were third-class citizens, and
that was a source of difficulty on occasion."</TE>
<TE>   The deposition was part of a lawsuit against the government by the
Simons and their investment partners. They contend the government's
seizure of Western Federal was improper and are seeking tens of
millions of dollars in damages. The government says mismanagement
caused the S&amp;L's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision, which monitored Western
Federal, released a statement this week in response to Simon's
remarks.</TE>
<TE>   "OTS conducts fair and impartial examinations of its
institutions," it said. "The goal of our examinations is to ensure
the safety and soundness of the thrift institutions and protection of
the deposit insurance fund."</TE>

<HD>Bush Asks Slothful Adults in U.S. to Get the Sweat Out</HD>
<DH>Health: Take a hike. Ride your bike. Make the U.S.
'stronger and healthier,' the president implores. Obesity is just
plain deadly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush will launch a physical fitness
initiative next week, hoping to coax some sweat out of the estimated
50% of adult Americans who do not exercise at all, the White House
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   As a part of the Healthier U.S. Initiative, Bush is declaring a
''fee-free weekend'' in all national parks June 22 and 23 ''to
encourage Americans to hike, walk or just visit our national
treasures,'' White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said.</LD>
<LD>   He said Bush, an avid runner who also works out with weights, was
motivated by statistics which show that nearly half of all adults in
the United States get virtually no exercise.</LD>
<TE>   ''And 7 out of 10 do so infrequently,'' Fleischer noted in his
daily White House briefing. Fleischer plays baseball and has been
spotted working out in hotel gyms on trips he has taken with the
president..</TE>
<TE>   The five major conditions associated with obesity--heart disease,
cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
diabetes--kill more than 1.7 million Americans each year and account
for more than two-thirds of all U.S. deaths, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Next Thursday, Bush is scheduled to host a fitness exposition on
the South Lawn of the White House, where he also will introduce new
members of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.</TE>
<TE>   The following day, Bush is to visit seniors in Orlando, Fla., to
discuss how age-appropriate exercise promotes healthy aging.</TE>
<TE>   June 22, Bush is scheduled to host a three-mile ''fitness
challenge'' run at Ft. McNair in Washington for the White House staff
and the Cabinet. His wife, Laura, who doesn't run, will lead a
1.5-mile walk.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said the president hopes the fitness initiative will
''help our nation become stronger and healthier.''</TE>

<HD>Treatment by Church May Have Been Shooting Motive</HD>
<DH>Crime: Rampage could have been spurred by '79 annulment
process from '59 divorce, officials say. Man killed two monks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CONCEPTION, Mo.</DL>
<LD>The man who killed two monks and wounded two others at a Roman
Catholic abbey was unhappy about how the church treated him after he
divorced, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators on Wednesday were pursing Lloyd Jeffress' bitterness
toward the church as a potential motive in the shooting rampage
Monday at Conception Abbey. Jeffress, 71, also killed himself.</LD>
<LD>   Police planned to view Jeffress' annulment papers from 1979, 20
years after his divorce, to learn more about his complaints.</LD>
<TE>   "We're hoping some documents from the church will shed some light
on this," said Sgt. Sheldon Lyon of the highway patrol. "We don't
know if we'll ever be able to say this is the motive, but it sure
could be."</TE>
<TE>   A source close to the investigation said Jeffress' daughter and
brother said Jeffress was upset at the way he was treated by the
church after the breakup of his five-year marriage with Della
Steward.</TE>
<TE>   The source did not elaborate about how the church might have
mistreated Jeffress.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, monks sprinkled holy water on the basilica walls of
the abbey, about 90 miles north of Kansas City, and held Mass before
reopening to visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffress didn't speak as he walked the monastery halls, killing
Brother Damian Larson, 64, and the Rev. Phillip Schuster, 85.
Schuster had spent 51 years at the abbey; Larson had been there 32
years.</TE>
<TE>   Larson, the first victim, pleaded for his life before he was shot,
Abbot Gregory Polan said.</TE>
<TE>   "He said 'No, no,' and [Jeffress] just plugged him" with the
rifle, Polan said.</TE>
<TE>   Two other monks were shot after they peeked out of an office to
see what had happened. Jeffress then shot himself in the mouth with
the Ruger .22-caliber rifle, Nodaway County Sheriff Ben Espey said.</TE>
<TE>   The wounded monks remained hospitalized and were expected to
recover.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffress and Steward were married Nov. 24, 1954, according to the
Missouri Bureau of Vital Records, and were granted a divorce May 11,
1959.</TE>
<TE>   The Dioceses of Kansas City-St. Joseph said the couple were
granted an annulment by the church in 1979. Details of the couple's
relationship are kept private, spokeswoman Rebecca Summers said.</TE>
<TE>   Lyon said Summers was cooperating with investigators, although he
declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   A search of the diocese's database of membership turned up nothing
on Jeffress, and none of its 100 parishes had indicated he was a
member, Summers said. Jeffress converted to Catholicism after his
marriage, Espey said.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffress recently had been attending Methodist services at a
church in Kearney, where he lived in a senior citizen complex. A
woman who rented Jeffress an apartment in Excelsior Springs between
1993 and 1997 said he never spoke of Steward, their marriage or his
feelings about the church.</TE>
<TE>   "We assumed he had been married because he had a daughter,"
apartment manager Sue McDougan said</TE>
<TE>   Police said Jeffress had served in the Army, but no other details
were known because his personal records were among many destroyed in
a fire.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffress was born in Kansas City, Kan., and worked for a steel
company and later the U.S. Postal Service, Lyon said.</TE>
<TE>   A search of his apartment turned up nothing to suggest he was
preoccupied with the Catholic Church, Espey said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators did find the antidepressant Prozac in the apartment,
although they were not sure whether Jeffress was taking it.
Toxicology tests could be complete in two weeks, Espey said.</TE>

<LD>   A nonbinding resolution adopted by 9,500 delegates at the Southern
Baptist Convention's annual meeting called on member churches to
address sex offenses by ministers, counselors, chaplains,
missionaries and others within their congregations. It also called on
churches to cooperate with civil authorities in prosecutions.</LD>
<LD>   Convention members also adopted, without debate, resolutions
praying for peace in the Middle East, supporting Israel and the war
on terrorism, and denouncing a new gender-neutral translation of the
Bible.</LD>
<TE>   Because of the traditional autonomy of the Southern Baptists'
local churches, the resolutions are not binding on the denomination's
16 million members.</TE>
<TE>   On the "sexual integrity of ministers," delegates expressed
sympathy for sex-abuse victims and their families and said violators
should be prosecuted "to the full extent of the law."</TE>
<TE>   "Ministers serve as trusted members of the community, in public
ministry, in personal and family counseling contexts, and as private
citizens," said the resolution, which passed with near unanimity. The
Rev. Frank Ruff, liaison to the Southern Baptist Convention from the
U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, was pleased with the "sensitive"
wording and tone of the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a put-down. It's not any kind of condemnatory or
accusatory kind of statement," Ruff said. "What I actually see
happening is a lot of support and empathy with a very evil moment in
our awareness of evil in ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a national Muslim organization Wednesday called on
religious and political officials to reject and repudiate a prominent
Southern Baptist pastor's labeling of the Prophet Muhammad as a
"demon-possessed pedophile."</TE>
<TE>   The comments by Jerry Vines, a Jacksonville, Fla., pastor and
former president of the Southern Baptist Convention, were made Monday
during the denomination's annual Pastor's Conference, which meets
just before the two-day annual meeting of the denomination.</TE>
<TE>   In preaching on the issue of religious pluralism, Vines criticized
those who believe all religions are of equal merit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that Islam is not
just as good as Christianity," he said. "Christianity was founded by
the virgin-born son of God, the lord Jesus Christ. Islam was founded
by Muhammad, a demon-possessed pedophile who had 12 wives and his
last one was a 9-year-old girl."</TE>
<TE>   The Council on American-Islamic Relations in Washington urged a
critical response.</TE>
<TE>   "We're calling on President Bush, other elected officials, as well
as Christian and Jewish national leaders to repudiate these
hate-filled remarks because I think silence on this issue equals
acceptance and very often Muslims are criticized for a harsh spirit,
harsh rhetoric or incitement," said Ibrahim Hooper, CAIR spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Bush addressed the opening session of the Southern Baptists via
satellite on Tuesday and told the messengers, or delegates, that he
and they "share common commitments."</TE>
<TE>   Top Southern Baptist officials supported Vines' stance. Hooper
said that that was "particularly disturbing."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Graham, a Dallas-area pastor elected Tuesday as the next
president of the Southern Baptist Convention, was among Vines'
supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Vines is one of our most dynamic preachers," Graham told
reporters at a news conference shortly after his election. "Actually,
his statement can be confirmed."</TE>
<TE>   Graham said he asked for the source of Vines' statement but did
not cite it to reporters. "I believe the statement is an accurate
statement," he said.</TE>

<HD>Bishops Urged to Punish Those Who Cover Up Crimes</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>The nation's Roman Catholic bishops, gathering here to address the
national storm of priestly sex scandals, faced vocal demands
Wednesday to go beyond zero tolerance for abusive priests and
discipline the leaders who cover the crimes up.</LD>
<LD>   Victim advocates held a private meeting and then an extraordinary
joint appearance with bishops. They called on church leaders to
strengthen the proposed new national policy on sexual abuse by
removing bishops who ''aided and abetted'' priests in repeating their
abusive behavior by reassigning rather than dismissing them.</LD>
<LD>   This demand, rising in many churches throughout the nation, is
shifting the focus of the Dallas meeting from errant priests to
church authorities.</LD>
<TE>   Bishops will formally open their conference today to debate what
would be the Roman Catholic Church's first mandatory national policy
on sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of Washington, D.C., said he found the
sessions ''heartbreaking.''</TE>
<TE>   ''In the last couple of hours, I hope I've grown. I hope I will be
wiser and more courageous when the [bishops' advisory] committee
presents its report,'' McCarrick told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Since the scandals broke in January, more than 250 priests and
four bishops have resigned, scores of churches have reported declines
in contributions and a rising tide of lay Catholics is demanding a
greater voice in church policy.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops will consider a
committee's proposal to defrock any priest who is found guilty of
sexually abusing minors after the new policy takes effect.</TE>
<TE>   In a controversial loophole, however, the committee proposed that
a priest who is guilty of a single incident of sexual abuse could be
returned to the ministry if he had sought psychological counseling,
was found not to be a pedophile and had the backing of a
lay-dominated sexual abuse committee.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Blaine, president of the Survivors Network of Those Abused
by Priests, said victim groups wanted the Catholic bishops not only
to provide penalties for themselves but also to eliminate the
loophole for priests and open all financial and personnel records to
scrutiny by law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Blaine said in the victims' three-hour meeting with bishops and
cardinals, the first in a decade, Catholic officials ''expressed a
willingness to hear the pain and suffering.'' But she added, ''We're
still going to be looking for more than lofty words.''</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Wilton D. Gregory, president of the U.S. Conference of
Catholic Bishops, said demands to hold bishops accountable were sure
to be hotly debated but declined to offer his own opinion on what
should be done. Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles said bishops
had been privately discussing the topic but were ''not sure at the
moment'' what the solution should be.</TE>
<TE>   Any proposal to remove bishops for administrative malfeasance
would require a change in canon law. Currently, only the pope can
remove a bishop, but an archbishop can recommend that Rome move
against a bishop in his region.</TE>
<TE>   ''In the short term, the chances of the bishops taking steps to
hold themselves accountable are very slim. But it's part of the
answer, so we'll keep bringing it up,'' said David Clohessy, director
of the survivors network.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Larry B. Stammer and William Lobdell
contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>NEW YORK</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Gov. George Pataki signed legislation that gives New York Mayor
Michael R. Bloomberg control of the city's school system.</LD>
<TE>   The 1.1-million-student system will become Bloomberg's direct
responsibility beginning July 1.</TE>
<TE>   The law also expands the Board of Education to 13 members.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the system is run by a seven-member board and a
chancellor. The mayor appoints two of the board members; the rest are
appointed by each of the city's five borough presidents. Bloomberg
will choose the chancellor, who is the school system's chief
executive.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg ran on a campaign last year to reform the city's
schools, which are beset by low test scores, high dropout rates and a
teacher shortage.</TE>

<LD>VIRGINIA</LD>
<LD>   A judge in Alexandria has denied Zacarias Moussaoui access to
airline security plans, saying the accused Sept. 11 conspirator could
contact future hijackers despite his strict confinement.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said his lawyers can see the
information but cannot share it with him.</LD>
<TE>   The order came as Moussaoui's lawyers said the defendant told Dr.
Raymond Patterson, his court-appointed psychiatrist, that the lawyers
were conspiring to kill him to keep him from revealing an undisclosed
secret. Patterson has concluded that Moussaoui was mentally fit when
he asked to represent himself.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui, who was in custody for immigration violations on Sept.
11, might have been the 20th suicide hijacker if he had not been
arrested last August when officials at a Minnesota flight school
became suspicious, according to the charges against him.</TE>

<DL>PROVIDENCE, R.I.</DL>
<LD>PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Two months after their selection to decide the
fate of Mayor Vincent Cianci Jr., jurors began deliberations
Wednesday in his federal racketeering and corruption trial.</LD>
<LD>   They deliberated for more than three hours before going home.</LD>
<LD>   In a 97-page indictment, Cianci, former top aide Frank Corrente
and businessman Richard Autiello are accused of taking kickbacks
often disguised as campaign contributions.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors say the men took kickbacks for tax breaks, city jobs
and contracts. The 12 charges include racketeering, extortion,
bribery and mail fraud. The most serious charges carry a maximum
penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   During the seven-week trial, jurors heard from 55 witnesses and
more than 1,000 documents were presented.</TE>
<TE>   They also heard FBI surveillance tapes showing city officials
cutting deals and taking bribes. Tax officials David Ead and Joseph
Pannone have since pleaded guilty to charges related to the case.</TE>
<TE>   In closing arguments Tuesday, Cianci's attorney had portrayed the
mayor's chief accusers as liars and thieves.</TE>

<HD>Bush Signs Bioterror Attack Bill Into Law</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush signed into law Wednesday a measure
designed to enhance America's ability to prevent and respond to
bioterrorist attacks, even as he warned of ''quite a number of
[terrorists] still out there.''</LD>
<LD>   Bush said the law will ''allow us to respond ... with
state-of-the-art medical care'' in the event of a biological attack.
He described such attacks as ''a real threat to our country'' and
''potentially the most dangerous weapons in the world.''</LD>
<LD>   The bill-signing ceremony in the Rose Garden at the White House
came as federal investigators continued their probe into the alleged
Al Qaeda plot to detonate a radioactive bomb in the United States, a
case that heightened concerns about domestic security. But Bush did
not mention the case in his public remarks.</LD>
<TE>   The new law seeks to bolster the preparedness of the public health
system, improve protections for the nation's food supplies, expedite
the development and production of vaccines and encourage better
government coordination.</TE>
<TE>   Specific provisions include expanding the nation's stockpile of
smallpox vaccines and providing grants to states to modernize
equipment. Nearly 25% of local public health departments still have
no e-mail capability, and fewer than half have high-speed Internet
access.</TE>
<TE>   The law also will allow the hiring of more food inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation, which was approved by Congress with only a single
dissenting vote, cast by Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas), also would
strengthen communication between front-line medical providers and
public health officials.</TE>
<TE>   ''Biological attacks can be carried out quietly. Our health-care
professionals are likely to be the first to recognize that there has
been an attack. The speed with which they detect and respond to a
threat to public health could be the difference between containment
and catastrophe,'' Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The law, when combined with funds already approved, raises total
authorized spending to fight bioterrorism to more than $4.6 billion,
with the precise amount to be set this year by Congress.</TE>
<TE>   In his Rose Garden remarks, Bush recalled last year's anthrax mail
attacks, which remain unsolved but are believed to be of domestic
origin.</TE>
<TE>   ''Last fall's anthrax attacks were an incredible tragedy to a lot
of people in America, and it sent a warning that we needed and have
heeded,'' he said. ''We must be better prepared to prevent, identify
and respond. And this bill I'm signing today will help a lot in this
essential effort.''</TE>
<TE>   Bush later convened his new Homeland Security Advisory Council,
charged with advising the administration on the creation of a
Homeland Security Department.</TE>
<TE>   At the council's first session, Bush warned anew of the continuing
threats of terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Saying that worldwide the counter-terrorism coalition has ''hauled
in'' about 2,400 terrorists, Bush added: ''Problem is, there's still
quite a number of them still out there.''</TE>

<HD>Senate Vote Blocks Repeal of Estate Tax</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Action ends Bush's effort to kill the levy,
and chances for revival this year are slim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush's drive to permanently repeal the estate
tax died in the Senate on Wednesday, despite intense election-year
pressure on Democrats to back the move.</LD>
<LD>   A majority of the Senate voted for the repeal, 54 to 44. But that
fell short of the 60-vote threshold needed to clear a crucial
procedural hurdle that would allow a final vote on the bill.</LD>
<LD>   Chances of reviving the bill later this year are slim. But
Republicans pledged to keep the fight over the so-called death tax
alive by trumpeting the issue in this year's congressional
campaigns--especially against Democrats running for reelection in
farm states where the tax has hampered some heirs' ability to inherit
family farms.</LD>
<TE>   Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) predicted Wednesday's vote would be a
''defining issue'' in the choice between Democrats and Republicans
this November. ''We will have a referendum on the death tax on
election day,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a rare break in a Congress marked by party-line votes, nine
Democrats joined 45 Republicans to support eliminating the estate
tax. Voting against it were 41 Democrats, two Republicans and one
independent.</TE>
<TE>   Among the Democrats voting against permanent repeal were two of
the party's most vulnerable Farm Belt incumbents who are seeking
reelection this year--Sens. Tim Johnson of South Dakota and Jean
Carnahan of Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   California's senators--Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, both
Democrats--voted against the repeal bill. Feinstein was one of 12
Senate Democrats who last year voted for the massive tax cut measure
that Bush pushed through Congress, which included a temporary repeal
of the estate tax.</TE>
<TE>   All of the provisions of last year's $1.35-trillion tax cut law
expire at the end of 2010. Under the law, the estate tax gradually
decreases before ending in 2010. But on Jan. 1, 2011, the tax is to
return to its 2001 rates, which means the largest estates would face
a 55% levy.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Christopher S. Bond (R-Mo.) called the prospect of the tax's
return ''a Dracula-like figure springing out of the grave.''</TE>
<TE>   But Democratic critics said that permanently repealing the tax is
a luxury that Congress cannot afford at a time when the government's
deficit is growing--unlike a year ago when the federal budget was in
the black.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's Senate vote effectively ends any prospect that this
year's Congress will decide to make permanent any part of the 10-year
tax cut law. Among its provisions, which include a cut in income tax
rates, the move to end the estate tax had the most political
momentum.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican-controlled House last week approved the bill to
permanently repeal the tax in a vote that underscored the proposal's
political appeal: 41 House Democrats broke ranks with their
leadership and joined 214 Republicans and one independent in
supporting the measure.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is the inheritance tax paid by heirs. Currently, any
estate valued at $1 million or less is exempt, so only a fraction of
estates are affected. In 1999, the most recent year for which figures
are available, 49,870 estates paid the tax. That included 7,445 in
California, more than any state.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the tax say its cost should be measured not just in the
money paid to the government from inheritances, but in the billions
of dollars a year that people pay in estate planning and special life
insurance to avoid or reduce their prospective tax burden.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday night, Bush called the Senate vote ''a disappointment
to the American people.'' He added: ''The Congress must fix this
unfair tax and provide families with certainty so they can plan for
the future.''</TE>
<TE>   The ''sunset'' provision in last year's tax cut law was included
for political and procedural reasons. Authors of the bill included it
to keep down the bill's price tag and because they did not have the
60 votes needed under Senate budget rules to cut taxes for more than
10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and his allies call the provision a quirk that should be
eliminated to implement Congress' intent of eliminating the estate
tax. They said keeping even a remnant of the tax amounts to a form of
income redistribution that hurts people who worked hard to accumulate
wealth over their lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   ''I see this as an affront to those who want to pass on the fruits
of their hard work to their children,'' said Sen. Wayne Allard
(R-Colo.), who is up for reelection this year in a state with
considerable agricultural interests.</TE>
<TE>   One reason the estate-tax repeal has proved less partisan than
other issues is that the tax's most vocal critics include the
influential farm and small-business lobbies. They argue that because
the estate tax is so steep, some who inherit family farms and
businesses have to liquidate those enterprises to pay the tax.</TE>
<TE>   ''People affected by this tax are not necessarily wealthy,''
Allard said.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional analysts say that permanently repealing the estate
tax would cost the government about $25 billion in 2011 and $56
billion in 2012.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the repeal expressed particular concern about the cost
in subsequent years--precisely the time when a majority of the baby
boomer generation begins to retire and puts a huge financial strain
on the government's retirement programs. According to projections by
the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, repeal of the
estate tax would drain $740 billion in federal revenue between 2013
and 2022.</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate debate, some Democrats argued that the money would
be better spent on domestic programs than on a tax break that goes
mostly to the wealthy.</TE>
<TE>   ''Strip it all away, this is a tax relief for billionaires when we
have a very big deficit and we have other priorities,'' said Sen.
Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.).</TE>
<TE>   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) offered a
Democratic alternative that would roll back but not repeal the estate
tax. Conrad's plan would have raised the amount exempt from taxation
to $3 million in 2003 and to $3.5 million in 2009 and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, the tax would apply to only 0.3% of all estates,
according to Conrad. But that alternative was rejected, 60 to 38.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, expressing Bush's
opposition to that proposal, said there were no grounds for
discriminating among estates in applying the tax.</TE>
<TE>   ''If it's wrong to tax people because they die, it's wrong to tax
people because they die at whatever amount of income they have,''
Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Another Democratic alternative, which was rejected, 54 to 44,
would have raised the exemption to $4 million and provided a special
tax exemption for family farms and businesses.</TE>
<TE>   That amendment was co-sponsored by Carnahan, who is facing a tough
reelection challenge from former GOP Rep. James M. Talent. Talent has
made permanent repeal of the estate tax a central campaign issue.</TE>
<TE>   Just this week, as Bush appeared with him at a fund-raiser in
Kansas City, Mo., Talent called the estate tax the ''stupidest of
stupid taxes.''</TE>
<TE>   Carnahan defended her votes on the issue, noting her alternative
would have provided immediate estate tax repeal for small businesses
and farmers, while the current law delays that relief for years.</TE>
<TE>   ''The argument about whether you should repeal the estate tax for
billionaires is different than if you want to support it for farmers
and small business,'' said Roy Temple, Carnahan's chief of staff.</TE>

<HD>Colorado Fire Rages Out of Control; More Evacuations
Possible</HD>
<DH>Disaster: With the blaze near Denver's suburbs, Gov. Owens
reassures residents the city is not at risk. At least 30 more homes
are burned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>While the massive 90,000-acre wildfire lingering near Denver's
southern suburbs is still burning erratically, Colorado Gov. Bill
Owens said Wednesday that the city itself is not threatened.</LD>
<LD>   The Hayman fire is once again burning out of control and thick
columns of smoke and strong winds prevented slurry planes from
getting airborne. Firefighters worked parts of the fire throughout
the day, but officials said little progress was made against what
they call a "weather-driven fire."</LD>
<LD>   The southern end of the blaze continued to trouble firefighters.
At least 30 homes were burned Wednesday near Lake George, about 120
miles south of Denver. A small subdivision called Turkey Rock in
Teller County was overrun by flames during a sudden wind shift,
authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   "The wind kicked up, and when that happens there's not much you
can do," said Kathy Hardy of the U.S. Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   That brought the total to 51 residences destroyed, a figure
officials say will rise as crews are able to view the burned area.
The Hayman fire started Saturday and was believed to have been caused
by an illegal campfire.</TE>
<TE>   The fire remained about 35 miles southwest of the Denver metro
area and about seven miles from residential areas in the fast-growing
southern suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   Owens--who has been roundly criticized by business and tourism
groups here for overstating the extent of the fires--reassured the
state and the nation that Denver was not threatened by the fire,
which covers 136 square miles.</TE>
<TE>   The pronouncement offered little solace to residents of the
outlying areas, where more than 6,000 people have been evacuated from
four counties.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials continue to warn that more than 30,000 residents
still are in the path of the fire and could be evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   More firefighters were called in and 1,800 were expected to be
battling the blaze today.</TE>
<TE>   Officials put firefighting costs so far at $20 million.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials said that, if the dangerous fire conditions
continue, they will consider closing public lands in the Rocky
Mountain region, home to some of the nation's most-used national
parks and forests.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Denver appeared to be spared from the fire, it was not
immune from its effects. Smoke and ash fell on the city earlier in
the week, causing respiratory distress among some residents.</TE>
<TE>   A longer-term concern is the protection of the city's water
supply. Water officials fretted that Denver's principle reservoir was
compromised by the fires that burned through the 8,500-acre
watershed.</TE>
<TE>   Ash already was fouling the water, but officials said their real
fear is what will happen when rain falls. The smallest storm will
bring charred debris into the reservoir.</TE>
<TE>   "The bad news for firefighters is there's been no rain; the good
news for us is there's been no rain," said Steve Work, operations
manager for the Denver Water Board.</TE>
<TE>   Work said a major fire in 1996 sent massive amounts of debris into
the water system--including outhouses, propane tanks and tree trunks.</TE>
<TE>   It took a month to remove everything and the effort cost millions
of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The ash, debris and sediment can be filtered, he said, but it is
very expensive to clean the water so that it is drinkable.</TE>
<TE>   "It's purely a matter of weather right now," Work said.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's going to be a long-term concern. The Forest Service
tells us it takes 20 years for a forest to heal itself."</TE>

<HD>Floods Lay Waste to Farms Throughout Upper Midwest</HD>
<DH>Disaster: Significant damage is reported. Hardest hit is
northern Minnesota, where nearly 17 inches of rain fell in just 21/2
days.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Wheat farmer Art Brandli has lived all his 60 years in the far
northern reaches of Minnesota, up by the Canadian border. He has
never seen anything like the disaster he woke up to on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Entire fields were submerged under 5 feet of water. Huge sinkholes
gouged just about every road around. Gravel and asphalt from the
washed-out roads had been swept for miles across the countryside,
until they lodged in stands of corn or barley.</LD>
<LD>   While drought continued to parch the West and fires blazed out of
control in Colorado, the upper Midwest was hit this week with record
flooding.</LD>
<TE>   Thunderstorms of window-rattling ferocity have touched down
throughout the Midwest, though rain stopped in much of the area
Wednesday. As rivers started to ebb, corn and soybean farmers in
Missouri and Illinois took stock and reported significant damage.</TE>
<TE>   But northern Minnesota took the worst pounding. In some places,
nearly 17 inches of rain beat down in 2 1/2 days. The Roseau River
rose 15 feet in a flash. And just as the sun was making a tentative
comeback Tuesday afternoon, an aging dike along the river burst,
sending water pouring into basements and pooling in the streets of
tiny Roseau (population 2,600).</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff called for the hospital to be evacuated. But by the
time patients were loaded onto buses, the roads were all but
impassable.</TE>
<TE>   The buses were towed to safety by construction equipment--the only
vehicles strong enough to forge through the waist-high water in the
streets.</TE>
<TE>   A nursing home and a home for mentally disabled children were also
evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest employer in town, Polaris Industries, called off its
production shifts, sending workers to sandbag the plant. Polaris
makes rugged all-terrain vehicles, which were put to good use as
workers struggled to navigate the lake that had once been their
parking lot. At one point, water in front of the plant was rising 4
inches an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the sandbags, the Polaris plant suffered little damage.
But the flooding elsewhere in town was so extensive, no one had yet
figured the cost.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to imagine," sighed Roseau County Sheriff Jule Hanson.
At least he could say the worst seemed to be over by Wednesday
afternoon. The Roseau River crested in sunlight at nearly 24 feet, 8
feet above the official flood stage and almost 3 feet above the
previous high-water mark, set in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   There was more good news in the forecast: Meteorologists were
calling for only scattered showers through the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   And the town felt prepared for any river surges in the days to
come. Hundreds of volunteers and National Guard soldiers had worked
day and night to place 80,000 sandbags around Roseau's most vital
buildings. "We're trying to save our hospital and our school," a
sheriff's dispatcher said.</TE>
<TE>   There was no saving cropland, however.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the Midwest, many farmers watched helplessly as the
thumping rains drowned grain they had planted only a week or two
earlier, in one of the few dry periods this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Susie Magnusson, a farmer's wife near Roseau, could barely bring
herself to describe the loss.</TE>
<TE>   "Very bad," she finally said.</TE>
<TE>   Art Brandli was equally grim. He said he hoped he might save some
of his crop if the several feet of standing water in his fields
drained off by the weekend. If it lingered any longer, though, he'd
have to start again from scratch.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, he could barely navigate the county because so many
gravel and asphalt roads were washed out--giant chunks of them just
gone. "I've been here a long time. My father has been here 90 years.
And we've never seen anything like this," Brandli said. "The water
came up so rapidly, it was impossible to be prepared."</TE>
<TE>   In his few hours at home, trying to rest, Sheriff Hanson said he
flicked on the TV news Wednesday morning and watched the wildfires
devouring the brittle forests of Colorado. Then he looked out the
window at his waterlogged town.</TE>
<TE>   And wished, for a moment, that Mother Nature could see fit to even
things out.</TE>

<HD>Church Denies Gotti Funeral Mass</HD>
<DH>Burial: But mob boss will be interred next to his son in a
Roman Catholic cemetery in New York.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Notorious mob boss John Gotti will be interred in a Roman Catholic
cemetery alongside his son, but his family was denied permission to
hold a funeral Mass for the convicted killer.</LD>
<LD>   Gotti, responsible for at least five murders during his bloody
reign atop the Gambino crime family, will not receive a Mass of
Christian burial, Father Andrew Vaccari, chancellor of the Diocese of
Brooklyn, said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Vaccari said in a one-sentence statement, "there can be a
Mass for the dead sometime after the burial of John Gotti."</LD>
<TE>   Gotti died of cancer Monday at a prison hospital in Missouri. He
had been sentenced to life in prison in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   The decision on the Mass echoed the ruling made by church
officials after the Gotti-ordered murder of his Gambino predecessor,
"Big Paul" Castellano, in 1985. Castellano's family received
permission for a private Mass after his burial, but was denied a
funeral Mass with the body in the church. But unlike Gotti,
Castellano was also denied burial in a Catholic ceremony because of
his life of crime.</TE>
<TE>   Gotti's remains were removed from the Missouri prison on Tuesday
for their eventual return to New York and his family, which has been
splintered by federal prosecution. Two of his brothers, his son and
his ex-son-in-law were all jailed at the time of his death; another
brother and a nephew were under indictment.</TE>
<TE>   But the family released no information about plans for a funeral
or wake. A spokesman for Gotti's daughter, Victoria Gotti, said only
that there would be a "private service."</TE>
<TE>   Gotti will end up in the family mausoleum that holds his son
Frank, who died in 1980 at age 12 when he was accidentally struck by
a neighbor's car. The neighbor, 51-year-old John Favara, disappeared
four months after the accident and is believed to have been murdered.</TE>
<TE>   The mausoleum is inside St. John's Cemetery in Queens.</TE>

<HD>Cincinnati's Suit Against Gun Makers Is Reinstated</HD>
<DH>Law: Ohio's top court reverses an appellate ruling, saying
the city had sufficient facts to pursue its drive to recoup violence
losses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT L. JACKSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Gun control advocates were cheered Wednesday when the Ohio Supreme
Court reinstated a lawsuit filed by the city of Cincinnati against
firearm manufacturers in an effort to recoup the cost of gun-related
violence.</LD>
<LD>   In a 4-3 ruling, the high court reversed an appellate court ruling
of two years ago in which judges held that the city could not recover
costs incurred from criminal and accidental shootings.</LD>
<LD>   Hailing the state Supreme Court decision, Washington-based gun
control attorney Dennis Henigan said, ''Without a doubt, this is the
most significant legal victory so far'' in a four-year campaign by
cities and counties across the nation to hold gun manufacturers
liable for gun-related deaths and injuries.</LD>
<TE>   Gun industry representatives noted that at least nine similar
lawsuits in other jurisdictions have been dismissed and that top
courts in Florida, Connecticut and Louisiana have ruled in favor of
the industry.</TE>
<TE>   The Ohio action, in fact, does not guarantee the ultimate success
of Cincinnati's suit. Justice Francis Sweeney explained that the
court majority, in reinstating the lawsuit, decided only that the
city did have enough facts to pursue its claims.</TE>
<TE>   ''While we do not predict the outcome of the case, we would be
remiss if we did not recognize the importance of allowing'' this type
of lawsuit to go past the initial stages, Sweeney said.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Justice Thomas Moyer and two other members disagreed. Moyer
said the alleged injuries that Cincinnati suffered were too far
removed from the conduct of gun manufacturers to give the city the
right to sue.</TE>
<TE>   But Henigan, legal director of the nonprofit Brady Center to
Prevent Gun Violence, which is helping to support more than two dozen
lawsuits against gun makers, said the high court ruling effectively
''upholds virtually all of the claims brought by Cincinnati against
the industry.''</TE>
<TE>   He said the ruling also would affect a parallel lawsuit by
Cleveland that has been moving through the courts since 1998 and
survived a dismissal motion two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the industry told the state Supreme Court that a
ruling favoring the city's position could make manufacturers of other
legal products equally liable.</TE>
<TE>   ''Alcoholic beverage manufacturers, who also produce a legal
product, would be held liable for misuse of alcohol,'' said James P.
Dorr, who represents Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co., one of the defendants. ''The
same thing with automobile manufacturers who have a generalized
awareness that their cars are going to be involved in accidents.''</TE>
<TE>   When cities and counties first began filing lawsuits against the
firearm industry four years ago, some gun control advocates hoped
that the nation's courts would act quickly to help reduce the
gun-related violence that has plagued urban areas.</TE>
<TE>   Similar to state lawsuits against tobacco companies, the
litigation was aimed at recovering millions of dollars in medical and
law enforcement costs resulting from gun-related violence. Plaintiffs
also sought to force firearm makers to produce safer guns and to keep
them from children and criminals.</TE>
<TE>   But now that 32 cities and counties have initiated lawsuits, it is
clear that success, if it is achieved, will come slowly.</TE>
<TE>   In general, the complaints charge that gun manufacturers,
distributors and trade associations are supplying firearms to an
illegitimate market, creating a public and private nuisance, and
failing to incorporate adequate warnings and technologically feasible
safety features, such as childproof locks.</TE>
<TE>   Results have been mixed. Some complaints have been dismissed
outright.</TE>
<TE>   For example, an Illinois judge rejected a $433-million suit filed
by the city of Chicago against 38 firearm industry defendants. Cook
County Circuit Judge Stephen A. Schiller ruled that police and
prosecutors, not the courts, could better address the problem of
illegal gun sales.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Delfay, president of the National Shooting Sports
Foundation, the industry's major trade group, noted that gun makers
already are governed by federal and state regulations meant to keep
firearms out of the wrong hands.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate Illinois action resulting from a police shooting, a
state appellate court ruled earlier this year that gun makers and
dealers could be sued for distributing firearms in a way that made it
easy for criminals and juveniles to obtain them.</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuits filed by 12 California cities and counties, led by Los
Angeles and San Francisco, have survived industry motions for
dismissal and are proceeding through pretrial discovery, with gun
manufacturers required to produce thousands of pages of corporate
documents.</TE>

<HD>Livermore Lab Is Taken Out of Plan to Change Cabinet</HD>
<DH>Security: The Bush administration shows a willingness to
respond to congressional concerns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON and NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In an early sign that it will be flexible with its proposed
Department of Homeland Security, the Bush administration dropped the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California as part of the
new Cabinet-level department Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The move underscored the administration's willingness to respond
to congressional concerns about the fine print of its proposal in
order to win speedy approval for the government reorganization. It
also suggested that the plan was likely to undergo much more
tinkering before it becomes final.</LD>
<LD>   ''It's a work in progress,'' Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge
said after a closed-door briefing with lawmakers.</LD>
<TE>   Of the Livermore lab, Ridge said, ''We're not going to take it
over.'' His aides said the administration is refining its proposal to
clarify the lab's role in homeland defense, which most likely will
include counter-terrorism research.</TE>
<TE>   Livermore's inclusion in the proposed department, which would
bring together the Customs Service, Immigration and Naturalization
Service, Coast Guard, Federal Emergency Management Agency and other
governmental units, mystified even supporters of President Bush's
proposal. Critics cited it as evidence of the haste and secrecy in
which the administration drafted the plan.</TE>
<TE>   The lab, east of San Francisco, is responsible for designing and
safeguarding the nation's nuclear weapon stockpile. But only a small
part of its work is related to homeland security, and most of its
7,500 employees work for the University of California, which manages
it for the Energy Department.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Ellen O. Tauscher (D-Alamo), whose district includes the lab,
said she thought its inclusion was a ''drafting error.''</TE>
<TE>   Tauscher said Ridge told her Wednesday that the administration had
no intention of moving the lab's operations or scientists into the
new agency. Rather, she said, scientists would continue to work at
the lab while funding for the lab's counter-terrorism efforts--such
as air monitors used at the U.S. Olympics in Salt Lake City --would
come from the new department.</TE>
<TE>   But Gordon Johndroe, the spokesman for the Office of Homeland
Security, said, ''It was never intended that the department would
assume all of the functions that currently take place at Lawrence
Livermore. The administration is refining the plan to more accurately
reflect the research needs of the new department.''</TE>
<TE>   Ridge's office and the Energy Department are working out the
details of the proposal regarding Livermore.</TE>
<TE>   At the lab, spokeswoman Linda Seaver said, ''We just don't know
how this will affect us yet.''</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, Bush convened his Homeland Security Advisory
Council, charged with advising the administration on the
reorganization and the overall counter-terrorism effort.</TE>
<TE>   The members include chairman Joseph J. Grano Jr., chief executive
of UBS PaineWebber and a veteran of U.S. Special Forces; and former
FBI Director William H. Webster, who will serve as vice chairman.</TE>
<TE>   After signing a bill Wednesday designed to bolster the country's
ability to deal with bioterrorism attacks, Bush intensified his
efforts to win congressional approval for the new department. He met
with leaders of congressional committees that would lose jurisdiction
as a result of the reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who attended the White House
meeting, said he told the president that he wanted to work with him.
"It's just very hard to assess the substance or even the prospects
for legislation because the administration hasn't submitted a bill,''
Waxman said.</TE>
<TE>   ''We hear different changes being talked about daily,'' he said.
''Some people are saying we should do it quickly. Others are saying
be sure to do it right. But we can't do anything until the White
House submits legislation.''</TE>
<TE>   Ridge, meanwhile, encountered tough questioning from lawmakers on
Capitol Hill. ''It isn't enough to send a salesman down here,'' said
Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.), the top Democrat on the House
Appropriations Committee, said after attending the meeting with
Ridge. ''You can have all the reorganization in the world, but if you
don't back it up with additional resources, you're going to have
empty boxes on the chart.''</TE>
<TE>   Even if parts of Bush's plan are changed or dropped, analysts
predict Congress will create a Department of Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   ''We're going to get a department," said James A. Thurber, an
American University government professor. "There's momentum behind
this thing. It's a matter of what's in, what's out."</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the Livermore lab, Thurber suggested the 54-member
California congressional delegation would have "a great deal of
influence" in deciding its fate.</TE>
<TE>   To some extent, Bush invited Congress to alter his plan. The
administration released a summary report on the department when he
spoke to the nation a week ago, but it offered relatively few
supporting details and said legislative language would be delayed.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The New England Journal of Medicine is relaxing its strict
conflict-of-interest rules for authors of certain articles because it
cannot find enough experts without financial ties to drug companies.</LD>
<LD>   The change, announced in today's issue, applies to experts who
write either editorials or review articles, which are overviews of
research on a particular drug or treatment, rather than original
studies.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Jeffrey M. Drazen, the journal's editor in chief, said the
policy reflects the way drugs are developed .</LD>
<TE>   "New treatments are brought out by investigators whose research is
in part supported by industry.</TE>
<TE>   "They're the ones who know about new stuff," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The change brings the journal's policy into line with that of
other medical publications such as the Journal of the American
Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Original studies in the New England Journal of Medicine will
continue to include a note saying who sponsored the research and
disclosing any financial stake the author might have.</TE>
<TE>   The change comes at a time when the credibility of medical
journals is under fire.</TE>

<HD>Renewed Terrorism Focus Reshapes Debate</HD>
<DH>Politics: Domestic issues have been pushed aside. Bush's
emphasis on homeland security adds up to challenges for the
Democrats.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When House Democrats release their plan for providing prescription
drugs under Medicare today, they will devote most of their energy to
generating local newspaper and television coverage in towns far from
here.</LD>
<LD>   The reason: With concern about terrorism once again dominating
Washington, they don't expect much attention from the national media.</LD>
<LD>   ''We have all lowered expectations,'' says Erik Smith, press
secretary for House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.).
''The emphasis becomes much more local.''</LD>
<TE>   That shift in strategy is a telling measure of how the continued
focus on terrorism is scrambling the political debate for the rest of
the congressional session and the midterm election.</TE>
<TE>   For months, almost all Democratic strategists, and even some
Republicans, have assumed that traditional domestic issues such as
the economy and Social Security would force terrorism and national
security from the spotlight as the election approaches. But with each
passing week, that assumption looks weaker.</TE>
<TE>   After a succession of high-level government warnings capped by the
arrest on May 8 of an American citizen allegedly plotting to acquire
a radioactive ''dirty" bomb, polls show that terrorism has reemerged
as the public's top concern.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, President Bush's ambitious proposal to establish
a Department of Homeland Security is poised to dominate the remainder
of the congressional session.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is going to be a massive pig going through the
congressional python, and it is going to shove an awful lot of other
domestic issues aside,'' said Jim Jordan, executive director of the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Sustained public attention to terrorism could pose several
electoral challenges for Democrats. The debates on terrorism-related
issues in Congress have eclipsed the domestic concerns that Democrats
wanted to highlight, such as prescription drug coverage and reform of
health maintenance organizations.</TE>
<TE>   And the ongoing concern about new attacks could raise the
political salience of national defense and homeland security, issues
that polls show voters think the GOP handles better than Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   ''That's going to make it harder for Democrats,'' predicted
Matthew Dowd, director of polling at the Republican National
Committee. ''Democrats would rather talk about an issue that they
have the lead on.''</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, for months, Democratic strategists across the party's
ideological spectrum have advised party candidates to stress their
agreements with Bush on the war against terrorism and then shift the
focus to domestic issues.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Democrats are growing increasingly concerned that the White
House is determined to rivet public attention on terrorism as long as
possible, in part through a steady stream of Bush speeches, proposals
and law enforcement announcements, like Monday's disclosure about the
alleged ''dirty'' bomb plot.</TE>
<TE>   Some Democratic officials accuse the administration of
manipulating these announcements for political advantage, either to
blot out discussion of intelligence failures before Sept. 11 or to
overshadow the lack of agreement in Congress on topics such as
providing prescription drugs for seniors.</TE>
<TE>   ''Obviously, the Republicans are politicizing national security
and the war,'' charged Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials adamantly deny such assertions. But they
acknowledge that Bush is trying to maintain public focus on the
terrorism threat.</TE>
<TE>   One ranking official said that, while partisanship is not the
motive for this effort, Bush ''wants to keep attention on the war on
terrorism because it is the issue that is front and center to who he
is, and it is going to be the definitional issue of his
administration.''</TE>
<TE>   Early this year, as the war in Afghanistan wound down, polls
showed most Americans ranked the economy--and sometimes other
domestic issues such as education--above terrorism when asked the
most important problem facing the country.</TE>
<TE>   But in the last month, terrorism has moved back atop the list.
That followed both the spike in suicide bombings in Israel, which
raised concerns about copycat attacks at home, and a spate of
warnings from top administration officials about the likelihood of
another terrorist attack in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   This tilt toward terrorism likely will grow even more pronounced
after the intense media coverage of the ''dirty'' bomb story.</TE>
<TE>   A survey by Democratic pollster Stanley B. Greenberg showed why
this shift could be bad news for his party. In the poll, voters who
said their top concern in the midterm election was domestic issues
favored Democratic candidates for Congress by 20 percentage points or
more. But those who said their primary concern was terrorism and
security favored Republicans by 17 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Most Democratic strategists remain optimistic that most voters
will still base their election day decisions on domestic issues, in
large part because they are unlikely to see significant differences
between candidates on terrorism-related issues.</TE>
<TE>   But Mitch Bainwol, executive director of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, said that votes in Congress on the defense
budget, funding for intelligence and the balance between security and
civil liberties will allow Republicans to create contrasts on this
terrain. Last spring, for instance, the GOP Senate committee ran ads
in South Dakota attacking Sen. Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) for votes he had
cast to cut defense programs.</TE>
<TE>   ''Everybody is for security,'' Bainwol said. ''But there are going
to be real, live votes on choices, and at the end of the day, the
candidates will not all be alike.''</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Bush's proposal to create a Cabinet-level Homeland
Security Department could present an electoral risk to Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   If Congress fails to clear the massive reorganization proposal by
election day--a formidable challenge, given its complexity and
scope--Republicans hint that Bush could use that as ''exhibit A" in
his case for why he needs a sympathetic GOP majority in both
chambers.</TE>
<TE>   In all these ways, the war against terrorism is generating
political ramifications different from more conventional conflicts,
like the Vietnam or Persian Gulf wars. While those confrontations
always ranked near the top of public concern while bullets were
flying at Americans, attention shifted back to other issues once the
last U.S. troops came home.</TE>
<TE>   But the war on terrorism increasingly looks like an open-ended
conflict with no obvious conclusion--no moment where the country
declares victory.</TE>
<TE>   ''I would look at it more like an issue such as crime, than as a
war,'' said John Mueller, an Ohio State University political
scientist who specializes in public opinion during wartime. ''It is
never going to go away.''</TE>

<HD>Romney Fights Residency Challenge</HD>
<DH>Politics: GOP candidate launches a TV ad blitz a day before
a ballot commission takes up a claim that he's not a Massachusetts
resident.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The Republican gubernatorial candidate strolls through a neighborhood
of multimillion-dollar homes. His neighborhood, he stresses. His
hometown.</LD>
<LD>   "This is Belmont, where I've lived, voted, raised a family and
paid taxes for 30 years," says Mitt Romney, wearing shirt-sleeves and
gazing straight into the camera.</LD>
<LD>   In a blitz targeting every major television station in the state,
Romney's 30-second spot debuts today, one day before the state's
Ballot Law Commission takes up a Democratic challenge to his status
as a Massachusetts resident.</LD>
<TE>   Romney's opponents say property tax records from Utah show that
while he was running the Salt Lake City Olympic Organizing Committee
from 1999 to 2001, the 55-year-old venture capitalist declared his
$3.8-million home in Park City as his primary residence. The move
saved Romney $54,000 in nonresident Utah property tax, according to a
story first reported in the Boston Globe.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time that he was living in Utah, Democrats charge,
Romney filed nonresident and part-year resident tax returns in
Massachusetts. A statute dating from Colonial times requires
Massachusetts gubernatorial candidates to have lived in the state for
at least seven consecutive years before seeking office.</TE>
<TE>   "The framers of our constitution, the oldest constitution in the
world, debated this at length and felt strongly that a governor in
particular had to be familiar with the needs and concerns of the
people. Seven years was the period they thought was the minimum
indication of that," said James R. Roosevelt Jr., legal counsel to
the Democratic Party of Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Romney, in his first press conference after he announced he
was running for governor, didn't know what the MCAT was," Roosevelt
said, referring to the state's standard public education test.</TE>
<TE>   Romney maintains that he has always considered Massachusetts his
home, and that a simple clerical error misclassified his Utah
residence. He said he failed to notice the mistake because, for two
years, the bills went to his wife. At a press conference last week,
he said he welcomes the Democratic challenge, flinging down his own
gauntlet with the familiar refrain: "Go ahead. Make my day."</TE>
<TE>   In a transcript released Wednesday of Romney's first TV ad, the
candidate uses the dispute to take aim at two of the Democrats
running for governor.</TE>
<TE>   "Shannon O'Brien and Tom Birmingham's allies are suing to push me
off the ballot because I spent three years in Utah working on the
Olympics," Romney says. "It's ridiculous, dirty politics, and we all
know what it's really about. I want to change Beacon Hill. They
don't."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for O'Brien, the state treasurer, said Wednesday that
where Romney lived was only part of the question. The Republican
candidate, said Adrian Durbin, offered too many conflicting
explanations when the matter was first raised.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't about Mitt Romney's residency, it's about his
honesty," Durbin said. "He is continuing to fail to tell the truth,
and he is trying to control the damage by running attack ads against
Shannon O'Brien and the Democrats."</TE>
<TE>   Noting that Romney continues to claim he did not know about his
$54,000 Utah tax break, Durbin said: "Why did the Deseret News of
Utah report that more than two years ago, Mitt Romney personally told
them that he declared Utah as his primary residence for tax
purposes?"</TE>
<TE>   A poll released last week by Boston's Suffolk University showed
41% of state voters supporting O'Brien and 32% backing Romney. In the
same poll, O'Brien received 37% of Democratic votes, while 19%
supported Birmingham, head of the state Senate. Former U.S. Labor
Secretary Robert B. Reich came in second among Democrats polled, with
a 22% rating.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Fehrnstrom, Romney's deputy campaign manager, dismissed the
idea Democrats were worried about Romney's integrity.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't buy it," he said Wednesday. "Mitt is the one who
disclosed all the information regarding his tax filing status while
he was in Utah. Mitt is the one who put forth all of the other
relevant information that showed he continued to vote here, register
cars here, pay taxes on his home here, pay utilities here."</TE>
<TE>   Romney, a Harvard Business School graduate, has run for office in
Massachusetts before, losing to incumbent Democratic Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy in a 1994 bid for the lawmaker's seat. Fehrnstrom brushed off
suggestions Romney also entertained thoughts of seeking office in
Utah.</TE>
<TE>   "The only time he has spent in Utah was the three years he was out
there running the Olympic Games," Fehrnstrom said.</TE>
<TE>   With Democrats outnumbering Republicans in Massachusetts by more
than 3 to 1, state GOP spokesman Nathan Little said his party is
determined to retain its grip on the coveted corner office on Beacon
Hill.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had the governor's office for 12 years," Little said. "We
plan to hold onto it for another four."</TE>
<TE>   So along with promoting Romney's image as a longtime state
resident, the party is trying to tone down the perception that he is
a wealthy and ambitious businessman who waltzed back to Massachusetts
and promptly steamrolled Acting Gov. Jane Swift, a Republican, out of
a job. To show that Romney is actually a man of the people, the
candidate cleaned fish in New Bedford last week and this week sold
sausages outside Fenway Park while the Red Sox were playing.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that 'common man' act is really silly," Roosevelt said.
"Anybody who doesn't notice that they got a $54,000 tax break has
plenty of money."</TE>

<HD>Terror Suspect Caught in Sudan, 5 in France</HD>
<DH>Arrests: Sudanese may be linked to suspected attack on a
U.S. plane at a Saudi base, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU, JOSH MEYER and SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The hunt for global terrorists intensified Wednesday with the capture
of a suspected Al Qaeda operative in Sudan and the arrest of five
other men in France in connection with failed terrorist plots, even
as authorities around the world searched for accomplices in a
separate scheme to launch a "dirty" bomb attack on American soil.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. authorities suspect that the man apprehended in Sudan is the
leader of an Al Qaeda cell and recently fired a surface-to-air
missile at a U.S. aircraft at the Prince Sultan air base in Saudi
Arabia, according to a U.S. government official who asked not to be
identified.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities described the capture of the unidentified Sudanese man
as significant because of his suspected role as a terrorist cell
leader and because he appears to be cooperating with authorities.</LD>
<TE>   "Was this guy a Zubeida? No," the official said, referring to the
Osama bin Laden lieutenant Abu Zubeida, who was captured in March.
"But this is someone important. Obviously, anybody who's looking to
fire down a U.S. aircraft, we want off the streets."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, U.S. and Saudi officials were alarmed to discover on
the air base the remnants of a fired missile that investigators
concluded likely was from Al Qaeda, according to a classified U.S.
report obtained by The Times. The discovery prompted the FBI to warn
U.S. law enforcement to look out for attacks against U.S. aircraft
using the 3 1/2-foot-long, shoulder-fired missiles.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear Wednesday what led authorities to the Sudanese
suspect, and authorities would not say where he is being held. He is
no longer believed to be in Sudanese custody, but he has not been
turned over to U.S. authorities, officials said. But he does appear
to be cooperating with investigators by revealing details about his
firing the missile.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in France, two Pakistanis and three men from North
Africa were roused from their homes outside Paris about 6 a.m.
Wednesday and arrested because police suspect they have ties to
Richard C. Reid, the 28-year-old suspected "shoe bomber" accused of
trying to blow up a Paris-to-Miami flight in December. The men, who
can be held for four days without being charged under France's
expanded anti-terrorism laws, may have provided Reid with logistical
support in France before he tried to fly to Miami, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the result of a months-long investigation. The five
people are suspected to be connected with Richard Reid," said Remi
Marechaux, a spokesman for the French Embassy in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Marechaux said that, while it is "too soon to tell" how deeply
involved in the bombing plot the five men may have been, U.S.
authorities may be allowed to question the detainees. "This was a
French operation ... but I don't see any reason why there wouldn't be
a continuation of the cooperation" between France and the U.S. in the
global hunt for terrorists in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, he said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   In the nearly six months since Reid's arrest, investigators have
become convinced that accomplices in France gave him shelter and
logistical support and prepared the complex explosive devices rigged
in his shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Detective work quickly pinpointed a cyber cafe in an immigrant
neighborhood in north Paris where Reid was seen with companions. He
sent numerous e-mails from the cafe in the days before he boarded the
American Airlines flight that was his target, according to officials.</TE>
<TE>   The probe overseen by top anti-terrorist magistrate Jean Louis
Bruguiere has advanced more slowly since then. In April,
investigators arrested seven Pakistanis suspected of acting as
accomplices, but later released six of them and returned the seventh
to Pakistan because he was an illegal immigrant. Several of the
suspects freed after the April roundup reportedly led French
authorities to the men apprehended Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities see some key similarities between Reid and Jose
Padilla, the former Chicago street gang member accused this week of
plotting to detonate a dirty bomb in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Neither man fits the traditional profile of the Middle Eastern
terrorist--Reid is a British drifter, while Padilla is a U.S. citizen
of Puerto Rican descent.</TE>
<TE>   Both men allegedly had ties to Bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. Reid
allegedly was an Al Qaeda operative who fell under the direction of
Islamic terrorists in Pakistan, while Padilla allegedly met and
traveled with key Bin Laden aide Zubeida in Pakistan and received
explosives training from other Al Qaeda-linked terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   And both men are believed to have flown to America alone from
Europe to wreak havoc on the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities suspect that Padilla, who converted to Islam in the
1990s and moved from Florida to the Middle East in 1998, flew into
Chicago last month on a "reconnaissance mission" to scout out
possible targets for detonating a radioactive dirty bomb. The weapon,
which authorities have feared Al Qaeda might employ, uses a
conventional explosive encased in radioactive waste to spew
contaminated debris over large areas.</TE>
<TE>   Although Padilla was believed to be in the early planning stages
of the plot, some U.S. authorities suspect that he planned to check
out university labs in the U.S. and other potential sources of
radioactive material, then report back to Al Qaeda leaders in
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   An associate of Padilla's, identified as Benjamin Ahmed Mohammed,
is in custody in Pakistan on suspicion of aiding in the plot, and
Pakistani Interior Ministry sources said there is an urgent search
for others there who may have been connected to the plot.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, however, little evidence has emerged to
suggest that Padilla had accomplices here.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we're concerned about that and following all leads," a
Justice Department official said Wednesday. "But so far" no
accomplices have surfaced.</TE>
<TE>   Papers filed by Padilla's court-appointed lawyer in New York City
were made public Wednesday. They ask that he be released from
military custody or at least be given access to legal counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla is in legal limbo, held by the military in South Carolina
as an "enemy combatant." The Pentagon says it has no plans to try him
in a military tribunal.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence linking Padilla to the alleged 'dirty bomb' plot is
weak at best," Donna R. Newman, the defendant's lawyer, said in the
document. "There is insufficient evidence for the government to
obtain an indictment against Padilla.... Padilla's constitutional
rights have been violated."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Michael B. Mukasey made no immediate ruling
but directed that a copy of the motion be served on the Pentagon and
gave the government until June 21 to respond.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, in Switzerland to meet with top Swiss
authorities about the war on terrorism, said Padilla's arrest points
up the ongoing threat posed by Bin Laden's network.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not believe that Al Qaeda maintained camps where thousands
or perhaps tens of thousands were trained simply so they could send
20 individuals into activity for one day--albeit a very tragic day,"
Ashcroft said, referring to the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Swiss authorities said they are working closely with U.S.
officials in the unfolding Padilla investigation and other
terrorism-related activities. Swiss counter-terrorism officials, for
instance, were watching Padilla closely, along with U.S. agents,
during his trips to Zurich from Pakistan, according to Mark Wiedmer,
a spokesman for the Swiss attorney general's office.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla made "possibly several" trips to Zurich and perhaps other
locations in Switzerland before his arrest May 8 at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport, where he had $10,500 in cash on him, and he
may have met with others who helped him with logistics or financing,
Wiedmer said.</TE>
<TE>   "He made several trips to Zurich; we are looking at whether he
brought money with him, if he got money here, if there were other
people involved," Wiedmer said. "You can be sure we are looking into
all of this and any possible relevant detail."</TE>
<TE>   Lichtblau and Meyer reported from Washington and Rotella from
Paris. Times staff writers Tyler Marshall, John J. Goldman and
John-Thor Dahlburg contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Relief in Sight for Sleep-Deprived Medical Residents</HD>
<DH>Medicine: An 80-hour workweek for in-training doctors is
expected to cure some ills in patient care.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NERISSA PACIO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many doctors-in-training will see their long work hours cut back
under new standards approved Wednesday by a group that accredits
teaching hospitals.</LD>
<LD>   The move to ease the strain on sleep-deprived residents comes as
concern is growing over medical errors in hospitals. With no limits
nationwide on residents' schedules, some work 120 hours a week or
more. Shifts vary from hospital to hospital and often between
specialties within the same hospital.</LD>
<LD>   "I've fallen asleep with my hands in a woman's vagina delivering a
baby because I was so tired," said Dr. Angela Nossett, chief resident
of the department of family medicine at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center
and vice president of the Joint Committee of Interns and Residents.</LD>
<TE>   Under the new rules set by the Accreditation Council for Graduate
Medical Education, residents are to work a maximum of 80 hours a week
with 10 hours off between shifts and one day off per week. Hospitals'
accreditation--required for federal funding--can be jeopardized if
they break the rules, which will take effect in summer 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Health-care providers agree that there is a correlation between
the number of hours resident physicians work and the number of errors
they make.</TE>
<TE>   "Errors are not being tolerated by consumers any longer," said Jim
Lott, executive vice president of the Healthcare Assn. of Southern
California. "Hospitals can pay more upfront now or pay more later in
terms of getting licenses or accreditations revoked, or lawsuits
filed."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, 200,000 medical residents filed a class-action lawsuit
in federal court accusing seven medical associations and 35 teaching
hospitals of rigging the system that determines where medical school
graduates will train, how much they will be paid and how many hours
they will work.</TE>
<TE>   The accreditation council said residents were spending too much
time doing work that can be done by others, such as drawing blood or
transferring patients, instead of concentrating on their medical
education. The council accredits 7,800 residency programs nationwide
and guides training for 100,000 residents.</TE>
<TE>   "More time should be spent with patients, in educational
conferences and learning the craft of being a physician," said Dr.
David Leach, executive director of the organization.</TE>
<TE>   Similar recommendations from the Council on Medical Education will
be reviewed at the American Medical Assn. conference in Chicago this
weekend. The AMA is set to decide early next week whether to
recommend an 84-hour workweek, averaged over two weeks. The AMA
recommendations would apply to any hospital, accredited or not, but
are not enforceable.</TE>
<TE>   New York is the only state to issue regulations governing resident
work hours. In 1989, the state adopted rules limiting residents to an
80-hour workweek.</TE>
<TE>   A change is overdue, several medical residents said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't give our patients optimal care; our own quality of life
is being affected," said Dan Schaefer, a second-year resident in
Harbor-UCLA's family medicine department. "The system needs to change
for two reasons: so physicians can live somewhat reasonable lives and
we can provide quality care to our patients."</TE>

<HD>Not Told of Key Report, Whitman Says</HD>
<DH>Environment: EPA chief says she got no advance word of
climate findings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Christie Whitman, the top U.S. environmental regulator,
said Wednesday she was not told in advance about a controversial
report released by the federal government that concluded greenhouse
gas emissions produced by human activities were the primary cause of
global warming.</LD>
<LD>   The report caused a stir last week among environmentalists because
it appeared to align the Bush administration with scientists who
believe vehicle emissions and pollution from power plants and oil
refineries have caused global temperatures to rise.</LD>
<LD>   The United States is the world's biggest energy consumer and
emissions producer.</LD>
<TE>   President Bush dismissed the report as a product of the federal
"bureaucracy." Bush said he had read the report, but the White House
later said the president was only briefed on the study.</TE>
<TE>   The report was quietly posted on the Environmental Protection
Agency's Web site after it was sent to the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   Whitman, the head of the EPA, said she did not read the report in
advance and did not know of the study until news organizations
reported it.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew about it when I read it in the paper," she said Wednesday
after a speech at an energy efficiency conference in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups have long questioned whether Whitman has a
say in setting administration environmental policies, or if those
decisions are made by White House officials. Her comments on the
climate change report raised more doubt.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly creates the appearance that she's an absentee
landlord at EPA," said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the
Clean Air Trust. "It's starting to look like she's [an EPA]
administrator in a ceremonial capacity."</TE>
<TE>   The report's conclusions were reviewed by the staff of the EPA,
the State Department and other agencies before it was published,
Whitman said. "Since nobody saw anything earth-shattering in what the
conclusions were ... they didn't think they needed to raise the red
flag," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Whitman and White House officials have tried to downplay the
controversy by citing a speech Bush gave last year when he stated
that human activities were a cause of greenhouse gas emissions.</TE>
<TE>   However, the administration's new report went a step further,
saying human activities were primarily to blame for global warming
and have caused "surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean
temperatures to rise."</TE>

<HD>Bases Loaded? Call Eckstein</HD>
<DH>Baseball: His three-run triple is the key hit for Angels in
8-5 victory over the Pirates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that Shaq and Kobe have taken their ball and gone home for the
summer, Southern California can turn its attention to the region's
newest superstar. He doesn't look the part. He doesn't enjoy talking
about himself. He might walk down the street without anyone noticing,
or stopping him for an autograph.</LD>
<LD>   He is the Angels' David Eckstein, an otherwise mild-mannered
shortstop who turns into a superstar with the bases loaded. He didn't
hit another grand slam Wednesday, but he stole the show once again,
stepping to the plate with the bases loaded and delivering a
game-winning triple in the Angels' 8-5 victory over the Pittsburgh
Pirates before 17,096 at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   Brad Fullmer scored three runs, and Benji Gil drove in two, as the
Angels remained one game behind the Seattle Mariners--and four games
ahead of the surging Oakland Athletics--in the American League West.
Troy Percival earned his seventh save in 11 days, and his 15th of the
season.</LD>
<TE>   Eckstein is turning into the 21st-century equivalent of Pat
Tabler, a decent hitter who turned into Babe Ruth with the bases
loaded. In eight at-bats with the bases loaded this season, Eckstein
has driven in 16 runs. He has four hits--three grand slams, a
category in which he leads the major leagues, and the triple
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   His slugging percentage with the bases loaded: 1.875. Take that,
Barry Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Weber got the victory for the Angels, although he gave up one
run and four hits in two innings.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied 4-4 in the seventh inning, and one out, Scott
Spiezio walked. With two out, Fullmer walked. Orlando Palmeiro
followed with an infield single, loading the bases for the superstar.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein flared an apparent single into center field, a line drive
that dropped tantalizingly close to Pirate outfielder Chad Hermansen.
On the short hop, the ball caromed off Hermansen's left leg and
rolled into right field. So the bases were cleared, Eckstein had a
triple, and the Angels had all the runs they would need.</TE>
<TE>   The Pirates got one back in the eighth inning, when Pokey Reese
singled home Craig Wilson. The Angels got one more in the bottom of
the eighth, when Spiezio singled home Darin Erstad.</TE>
<TE>   Angel starter Aaron Sele did exactly what the team asks him to
do--pitch innings, and give the team a chance to win. It wasn't
pretty on this night, but it was effective.</TE>
<TE>   Sele gave up four runs in six innings. To be more precise, he gave
up four runs in one inning--the fourth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kendall and Brian Giles opened the inning with back-to-back
singles. One out later, Wilson doubled home both runners.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Young singled Wilson to third, and a walk to Rob Mackowiak
loaded the bases. Reese singled home a run, Hermansen drove in
another on a sacrifice fly, and the Pirates had four in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   But Sele did not breeze in any inning. The Pirates put at least
one runner on base against Sele in every inning but the fifth, and
even then they would have but for a spectacular bare-hand stop and
off-balance throw by third baseman Troy Glaus.</TE>
<TE>   Sele has the highest earned-run average among the Angel starters,
4.97. But he doesn't worry about his statistics so long as the team
is winning. Of the last nine games he has started, the Angels have
won eight.</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer, who rarely starts against left-handers, got the start
Wednesday and got the Angels off to a good start. In the second
inning, Fullmer doubled home two runs against Pirate left-hander Joe
Beimel, lifting the Angels to a 2-0 lead. Fullmer later scored on a
single by Gil.</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer scored the tying run in the sixth inning. With two on and
two out, Gil delivered his second single of the evening, tying the
score, 4-4.</TE>
<TE>   Beimel, making his second start of the season after 22 relief
appearances, pitched five innings and left after 80 pitches. He gave
up three runs and seven hits, walking three.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Team Wants 2005 All-Star Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels plan to pursue the 2005 All-Star game, hoping to bring the
marquee event to Anaheim for the first time since 1989.</LD>
<LD>   "We would love to get the game back here," said Kevin Uhlich, the
Angels' senior vice president of business operations.</LD>
<LD>   The recent expansions of the Anaheim Convention Center and the
Disneyland resort provide plenty of space for the fan festival and
corporate hospitality that accompanies an All-Star game. Major league
officials prefer awarding the All-Star game to teams with new
ballparks; the Angels would love to show off the renovated Edison
Field.</LD>
<TE>   The game traditionally alternates between American League and
National League stadiums, with the 2003 All-Star game scheduled for
Comiskey Park in Chicago. By then, the game will have been played in
every new AL ballpark except Comerica Park in Detroit. The Tigers
also are interested in playing host to the 2005 game.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are lobbying for an All-Star game too, and one
Southern California game would not necessarily rule out another. The
All-Star game was played in San Francisco in 1984 and Oakland in
1987.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Pittsburgh Pirates are under .500, but the National League
Central is weak enough that the Pirates remain in the division race.
If they fade as the July trading deadline approaches, and if the
Pirates decide to trade away veterans, reliever Mike Fetters said he
would love to return to the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are looking for affordable relief help. If he becomes
available, they could rent Fetters, 37, for $720,000 for the final
two months of this season, plus a $250,000 buyout of his contract
next season. The right-hander struck out two in one scoreless inning
Tuesday. As the setup man to closer Mike Williams, Fetters has a 1.85
earned-run average, with 23 strikeouts in 24 innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were in first place when they traded Fetters to
Pittsburgh last summer, and he was crushed, since he has played 12
seasons without a postseason appearance. He made his debut with the
Angels in 1989 and played for them again briefly in 1998, though he
was too young to do much in the '89 pennant run and was injured
during the '98 run.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe the third time's the charm," he said. "I'd love to have a
chance to play in the playoffs with them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Adam Kennedy, who expressed frustration and
resignation Tuesday over what he regarded as an emerging platoon, did
not start against an opposing left-hander for the third consecutive
game.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia said Kennedy will probably start against
Kazuhisa Ishii or Odalis Perez, the left-handers scheduled to face
the Angels this weekend at Dodger Stadium.</TE>

<DL>DHAKA, Bangladesh</DL>
<LD>Argentina's exit Wednesday from the World Cup stunned thousands of
Bangladeshi soccer fans, one of whom succumbed to a heart attack,
while others tore down Argentine flags and burnt them in anger.</LD>
<LD>   Lokman Hossain, a 48-year-old businessman who was hospitalized
after suffering a heart attack when Argentina lost to England on June
7, died on Wednesday, his brother Abdul Hannan said.</LD>
<LD>   Many distraught fans took down giant Argentine flags that they had
hoisted atop their homes. Some tore up the flags or burnt them in
anger, while others replaced them with Brazilian or Italian ones.</LD>
<TE>   Two young fans of Argentina have already died in Bangladesh since
the World Cup started on May 31.</TE>
<TE>   One of them fell from a rooftop while trying to hoist Argentina's
national flag in the town of Cox's Bazar, 185 miles south of Dhaka.</TE>
<TE>   In the second fatal accident, a 17-year old fell into power lines
and was electrocuted as he tried to hoist Argentina's flag atop a
building in another southern city, Chittagong.</TE>

<HD>Latest Round Goes to Kim</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Arizona closer saves 9-5 victory over Yankees,
who hit key homers against him in the World Series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>One way or another, everything Byung-Hyun Kim throws at Yankee
Stadium winds up clearing the fence.</LD>
<LD>   Kim, pitching in the Bronx for the first time since his World
Series meltdowns last year, retired six batters to preserve the
Arizona Diamondbacks' 9-5 victory over New York on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   As teammates congratulated him behind the mound, Kim took the
baseball he threw to get the final out and heaved it onto the netting
beyond the left-field wall. It landed not far from the spot where
Scott Brosius homered to tie Game 5 last fall.</LD>
<TE>   "It was just for fun," Kim said through an interpreter. "It would
have been shame or loss of face if it did not go over the fence."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona starter Miguel Batista (4-3) again outpitched Mike Mussina
(9-3), getting home-run support from backup catcher Rod Barajas and
Steve Finley, just as he got in Game 5 of last year's Series.</TE>
<TE>   Finley homered twice, his 15th career multihomer game, and drove
in five runs to help the Diamondbacks win at Yankee Stadium for the
first time in six tries--including last year's Series.</TE>
<TE>   Kim was greeted in the eighth inning by sarcastic cheers from the
crowd of 50,864 in reference to the three crucial home runs he gave
up in the Series.</TE>
<TE>   But the 23-year-old South Korean sidearmer was not fazed. With a
light drizzle falling, he struck out Bernie Williams, Jason Giambi
and Jorge Posada on 12 pitches to quiet the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "I never had any doubts," said Manager Bob Brenly, who was heavily
criticized for using Kim in Game 5 last season. "Hopefully, this will
put all that behind him. I think he's a much stronger pitcher
mentally than he was last year. I'm ecstatic for him."</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees put two runners on in the ninth before Kim struck out
Marcus Thames and got Shane Spencer to ground into a double play for
his 17th save.</TE>
<TE>   Batista gave up two runs and five hits in six innings, and left
because of a blister on a finger. Mussina gave up six runs and a
season-high 10 hits in five innings</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to forget what I experienced here [in the Series],"
Kim said.</TE>

<HD>Braves' Moss Is Doing Fine as Understudy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Rookie Damian Moss has been taking cues from veteran left-hander Tom
Glavine.</LD>
<LD>   Moss pitched seven shutout innings, helped by a spectacular play
by center fielder Andruw Jones, and struck out a career-high eight to
lead the Atlanta Braves over the Minnesota Twins, 3-2, Wednesday
night.</LD>
<LD>   Moss (3-2) gave up two hits, allowed only one runner as far as
second base and picked off two runners to help the Braves win for the
eighth time in nine games.</LD>
<TE>   His performance came one night after Glavine shut out the Twins on
two hits over seven innings in an 11-0 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always good to follow [Glavine]," Moss said. "Watching him
gives me a good read on what hitters are going to do off of me."</TE>
<TE>   The left-hander has given up two earned runs or fewer in nine of
12 starts this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I'm quite as refined as Glavine is," Moss said. "I
think sometime in my career I have the chance to be if things go my
way."</TE>
<TE>   Moss got more help from Jones, a four-time Gold Glove winner, in
the seventh inning. Jones made a running catch of Torii Hunter's fly
ball on the warning track in center field, took a few steps and fired
a throw on the fly to first baseman Wes Helms to double up Matthew
LeCroy.</TE>

<HD>Bonds Finally Slugs One Out at SkyDome</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds waited until his last at-bat at SkyDome before homering.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds connected in the ninth inning for his 22nd home run, and
Damon Minor went four for four and homered in his third consecutive
game as the San Francisco Giants defeated the Toronto Blue Jays, 6-3,
Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds has homered in 12 consecutive series and in every park he
has played in his major league career.</LD>
<TE>   "I was having trouble seeing the ball out there the first couple
of days," Bonds said. "It's tough when you don't know the pitchers
that well."</TE>
<TE>   Toronto reliever Cliff Politte threw three consecutive balls and
then a strike before Bonds homered into the second deck in left
field, giving the Giants a 6-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds went two for three with two intentional walks. He was walked
five times in the series and leads the majors with 79 walks.</TE>
<TE>   Politte seemed proud to give up the homer.</TE>
<TE>   "I still talk about the one that I gave up to Sammy Sosa in 1998,"
Politte said. "I'm just fortunate Mark McGwire is out of the game so
I don't have to give one up to him."</TE>
<TE>   Raul Mondesi hit a three-run homer against Felix Rodriguez in the
eighth inning, cutting the deficit to 5-3.</TE>

<LD>Don't hold your breath waiting for the San Diego Chargers to relocate
to Los Angeles, says Nick Canepa of the San Diego Union-Tribune:</LD>
<LD>   "The Chargers move to Los Angeles? The place can't hold onto what
it has.</LD>
<LD>   "L.A. might not be able to keep its most storied possession,
Hollywood, which not only is threatening to secede from the nation's
second-largest city but plans to vote on secession in November. Well,
there's always Van Nuys, at least there is unless the San Fernando
Valley votes to secede as well.</LD>
<TE>   "As for the Chargers, it doesn't appear as though they'll be
backing up the U-Hauls any time soon. The NFL franchise and its L.A.
suitors are discovering Los Angeles is part of California, too. If
you're talking slow, there's continental drift, followed by trying to
get something of consequence built in this litigious state."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the first Southern Section baseball player of
the year, in 1938? Hint: He became a Hall of Fame pitcher and major
league manager.</TE>
<TE>   Bench marks: Catcher Ivan Rodriguez of the Texas Rangers has as
many Gold Gloves (10) and consecutive All-Star game starts (nine) as
Johnny Bench, but he still has some catching up to do with the Hall
of Famer.</TE>
<TE>   "I had 15, 16 broken bones and seven broken cups, and he's only
got one broken bone and three cups broken," said Bench, who presented
Rodriguez with his 2001 Gold Glove trophy Monday. "So he's way
behind."</TE>
<TE>   Guessing game: Carol Slezak of the Chicago Sun-Times says
baseball's latest scandal has spawned a new topic of conversation:</TE>
<TE>   "While Major League Baseball is figuring out what to do about
steroids, baseball fans are playing a new game: Name that steroid
user. I've seen it played many times recently--at the gym, in bars,
over dinner with friends."</TE>
<TE>   Flying fur: Police in St. Petersburg, Fla., are investigating an
incident in which the Tampa Bay Devil Rays' furry blue mascot,
Raymond, was knocked over by a man who ran onto the field after
Sunday's game. Raymond injured his right shoulder in the collision,
and team officials are skeptical it was an accident.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was an accident, you'd think he would have stopped to see
how Raymond was," team spokesman Rick Vaughn said.</TE>
<TE>   Tasting a title: Steve Duchesne of the Detroit Red Wings spent
Monday having a root canal to remove nerves from the two teeth he
lost when he took a puck in the mouth in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup
finals. He also lost four teeth from a bridge.</TE>
<TE>   But that didn't stop Duchesne from diving face-first to try to
block a shot in Monday's Game 4. "I've still got my bottom teeth, so
I figure I'm all right," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Bob Lemon of Long Beach Wilson High.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Authorities on the Mediterranean island of Cypress
are investigating reports that soccer-obsessed children as young as
12 have been placing bets with bookmakers on World Cup games,
violating a law requiring bettors to be at least 18.</TE>
<TE>   The father of a 14-year-old said his son has been betting almost
daily since the World Cup began, encouraged by a string of wins.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what I'm more angry at, the gambling or the
winning," the father said. "We haven't spoken in a week."</TE>

<HD>Ashby Has His Sinker on the Rise</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Dodger starter goes a strong 71/3 innings and
Gagne gets 22nd save in 4-2 victory over Devil Rays.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Andy Ashby spent Tuesday morning in a fishing boat, bagging several
bass on Lake Tarpon, which is a half-hour north of Tropicana Field.
Wednesday night, the Dodger right-hander had the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
hook, line and sinker.</LD>
<LD>   Relying heavily on a sinking fastball that induced 11 ground-ball
outs, Ashby gave up only one run and seven hits in 7 1/3 innings to
lead the Dodgers to a 4-2 interleague victory over the lowly Devil
Rays before a crowd of 11,083.</LD>
<LD>   Overpowering, Ashby wasn't--he struck out one--but he walked only
two and was in command throughout his efficient, 85-pitch
performance, putting the finishing touches on the Dodgers' 6-3 trip
through Colorado, Baltimore and Tampa Bay and providing a pleasant
flashback for Manager Jim Tracy.</LD>
<TE>   "This was what I witnessed from him in 1998, when he had a pretty
darn good year," Tracy said, referring to Ashby's career-best season
with the San Diego Padres, when he went 17-9 with a 3.34 earned-run
average and 151 strikeouts in 226 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "He's getting stronger; you can see it with his effectiveness and
the way the ball is coming out of his hand. The heaviness of his
sinker is returning, and that's part of getting over the hump [of
returning from elbow surgery], when you're finishing pitches with
authority, knowing nothing's going to fall off or get hurt when you
throw."</TE>
<TE>   Ashby, who had surgery to repair a torn flexor tendon last June
15, was erratic all spring and choppy for the first five weeks of the
season, sprinkling in a few excellent starts with several subpar
outings. But in his past six games, Ashby (6-5) has given up only
nine earned runs in 41 2/3 innings for a 1.94 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   Is the 34-year-old beginning to feel like he did in 1998?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to jinx myself by answering that question," Ashby
said. "The main thing is I feel good, and when I feel good, I can do
my job. I hope my stuff gets to be as consistent as it was in 1998.
Maybe it is. Hopefully it will stay that way."</TE>
<TE>   Closer Eric Gagne struck out two of three in the ninth for his
major league-leading 22nd save, and Shawn Green's fifth-inning home
run, his 16th of the season, was the highlight of an offense that
made the most of seven hits, including Mark Grudzielanek's double and
Alex Cora's RBI single in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Leadoff batter Dave Roberts, idle the past two nights because the
Devil Rays started left-handers, provided some fuel injection to the
Dodger offense, opening the game with a bunt single, stealing second
and scoring on Paul Lo Duca's single. Lo Duca scored on Brian
Jordan's fielder's choice for a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to set the tone," Roberts said. "We got our butts handed
to us [11-2 Tuesday night], and I wanted to make a statement that we
needed to win this game. When you don't see the field for a couple of
days, you really want to exert some energy, and if I bring that to
the table, hopefully everyone feeds off of that."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts also bagged his team-leading 16th stolen base in the
second inning. He's batting .320 with 29 runs and .402 on-base
percentage.</TE>
<TE>   "He makes it happen--he's a real table-setter," Jordan said. "I
like what he's done, taking advantage of his skills.</TE>
<TE>   "He bunts for a hit and it's a double. He puts pressure on the
pitcher. He's really maturing as a leadoff hitter. He's been awesome
all year."</TE>
<TE>   About the only downer for the Dodgers was the play of third
baseman Adrian Beltre, who made a throwing error and a fielding error
and has one hit in his last 16 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre went on a tear in mid-May, raising his batting average as
high as .283, and Tracy moved him to the No. 2 spot. But Beltre has
gradually slipped back to .250, he's back in the seventh spot, and he
has made three errors in the last two games.</TE>
<TE>   "This team needs Adrian Beltre to be as good as we know he's
capable of being, and we're waiting on him," Tracy said. "The group
is waiting on him."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Sore-Shouldered Daal Will Skip One Turn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers will take advantage of Monday's off-day and skip Omar
Daal's next turn in the rotation, giving the left-hander nine days to
recover from a case of biceps tendinitis before pitching against
Boston on June 22.</LD>
<LD>   The injury is not expected to send Daal to the disabled list, but
it did put him in Manager Jim Tracy's doghouse temporarily. Tracy was
upset that Daal did not tell him or a trainer that his shoulder began
bothering him after a May 26 relief appearance at Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   Daal replaced the injured Kevin Brown in the rotation after that
game and has been rocked for 21 earned runs and 24 hits, including
four home runs, in 16 1/3 innings of three subsequent starts, all
losses.</LD>
<TE>   Daal told reporters after Tuesday night's loss to the Devil Rays
that his shoulder was sore, and when asked to comment on Daal's
condition, Tracy said, "That's the first I've heard of it." Tracy
spoke to Daal about the lack of communication before Wednesday's
game.</TE>
<TE>   "The disappointing thing is he mentioned it to you and not to me,"
Tracy told reporters. "That's just not the way we do things around
here. But it's done and over with. It's been talked about."</TE>
<TE>   Daal, unhappy with his demotion to the bullpen to start the
season, kept the injury to himself because he did not want to
jeopardize his chances of staying in the rotation. Tracy empathized
with Daal's position but encouraged him to speak up about such
matters in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have the kind of training staff that will inhibit a guy
from playing if the problem is minor," Tracy said. "Don't worry about
going into that [training] room and having someone pull the rug from
under you. I made it clear in talking to him that I'm not going to
take the ball away from him unless I think he's going to get hurt."</TE>
<TE>   After this weekend's series against the Angels, Andy Ashby,
Kazuhisa Ishii and Odalis Perez will start a Tuesday-through-Thursday
series against Toronto, all on four days' or five days' rest. Hideo
Nomo, Daal and Ashby are scheduled to pitch against Boston June
21-23.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers signed first-round pick James Loney, the 19th overall
selection in the recent draft, to a $1.5-million bonus Wednesday, and
the high school first baseman will begin his professional career at
Great Falls, Mont., of the Pioneer League.</TE>
<TE>   Loney, who will take batting practice in Dodger Stadium before
Saturday's game against the Angels, hit .563 with eight homers and 46
runs batted in to lead Lawrence Elkins High to the Texas state
championship. He also went 12-1 with a 1.60 earned-run average as a
pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   The Pioneer League, a high-level rookie league, is a starting
point for many college players, "but we want to try to push him a bit
to see how he does," Dodger scouting director Logan White said. "I
think he'll handle it OK."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have signed six of their first nine draft picks,
including fourth-round pick Delwyn Young, a Santa Barbara City
College second baseman who received, $265,000, and seventh-round pick
David Bagley, a University of San Diego third baseman.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brown remained hospitalized Wednesday while recovering from
Tuesday's surgery on a herniated disk in his lower back, but he was
able to get out of bed and walk around. If Brown, who is expected to
be discharged from USC Medical Center today, is unable to pitch again
this season, insurance would pay about $6 million, or 40%, of his
$15-million contract.</TE>

<HD>A Little Luck of a Draw Helps England Advance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three questions for Three Lions on a day England saw its shooters go
oh-for-Osaka, Japan, yet still qualified for the second round:</LD>
<LD>   1) Was England sandbagging during its 0-0 draw with Nigeria at
Osaka Nagai Stadium Wednesday, preferring to finish second in Group E
instead of first, which would mean a second-round match against a
familiar foe, Denmark, instead of unpredictable and explosive
Senegal?</LD>
<LD>   2) If not, shouldn't England have expected more of a performance
against a Nigerian squad that had been eliminated days earlier and
had nothing tangible to play for?</LD>
<TE>   3) Either way, how much further can England progress in the World
Cup with an offense that has yet to produce a goal in open play?</TE>
<TE>   Captain David Beckham addressed these issues after his team used
the lackluster tie to clinch second place in Group E behind Sweden
and earn a second-round match against surprising Group A winner
Denmark Saturday in Niigata, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "There are going to be some cynics complaining about the way we
played, and that our goals have not come from open play [but only]
from a corner and a penalty," Beckham said. "But I don't think
anybody could argue about the way we played against Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   "There was always going to be a comedown after Argentina, but we
went out there, did a professional job and we are through."</TE>
<TE>   Beckham described the heat and humidity in Osaka as the worst he
has played in, attributing England's sporadic performance to the
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   And, for the record, England Coach Sven-Goran Eriksson said his
team wasn't trying to dodge anyone, that "it doesn't matter who we
play.... It was hot and very difficult. We knew Nigeria wanted to try
and win the game, and I think they played very well."</TE>
<TE>   England finished group play with five points at 1-0-2, same as
Sweden, but scored only two goals to Sweden's four.</TE>
<TE>   One came on a corner kick, Beckham to Sol Campbell, in the 1-1 tie
with the Swedes. The other was Beckham's decisive penalty kick
against Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   England will need to do better than that against Denmark, one of
the best defensive units in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, however, Eriksson wanted to contemplate the
achievement at hand: England advancing from the much-advertised
"Group of Death."</TE>
<TE>   "That was our first target," he said. "We did it."</TE>

<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>

<DL>FARMINGDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>So maybe it is too early to cue Tiger Woods for his acceptance
speech. If you think about it, chances are that Woods, the heavy
favorite once again, won't win the U.S. Open, because he has played
seven of them and won only one.</LD>
<LD>   The truth is that Tiger has formidable challenges to overcome,
such as a golf course he doesn't really know, the pressure of being
the favorite, 42,500 fans yelling in his ear each day and other
players who can hit the ball about as far as he does, and maybe even
straighter.</LD>
<LD>   He is familiar with them and so are you: David Duval, Phil
Mickelson, Vijay Singh, Ernie Els, Sergio Garcia and maybe even David
Toms and Retief Goosen, to name a few.</LD>
<TE>   It would be nice to hear Tiger's innermost thoughts about the
challenge he faces at Bethpage Black this week. Come to think of it,
it would be great to know what he is really thinking every time he
shows up to play a tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Not going to happen. Woods doesn't operate that way. His time with
the media is usually spent revealing as little as possible while
being polite at the same time. It's a well-rehearsed approach and
fairly effective, even though it's not that fulfilling. You are
virtually guaranteed to hear almost the same thing at each of Tiger's
news conferences.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, take what he said at his only formal interview
session with the media before the Open. It was pretty bland stuff.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine how great it would be to really know what Tiger meant to
say.</TE>
<TE>   Woods: "I think anybody who can hit the ball long and high is
going to have an advantage. But you've still got to hit the ball in
the fairway in order to have a chance to win the title."</TE>
<TE>   Interpretation: "Long and high and goodbye, baby. Who's going to
finish second?"</TE>
<TE>   Woods: "The fans are definitely into it."</TE>
<TE>   Interpretation: "The fans are definitely out of it. If I hear one
more guy say 'You da man!' I think I'll scream."</TE>
<TE>   Woods: "I'm pretty comfortable on this golf course."</TE>
<TE>   Interpretation: "All I need is a remote control and a recliner.
The last time I was uncomfortable on a golf course, I had a rock in
my shoe."</TE>
<TE>   Woods: "I'm pretty much comfortable with every facet of my game
right now."</TE>
<TE>   Interpretation: "I love saying stuff like I'm comfortable with
every facet of my game because it scares the Gatorade out of
everybody else I have to beat."</TE>
<TE>   Woods: "I'm probably not hitting the ball like I did in 2000."</TE>
<TE>   Interpretation: "I'm probably hitting it better than I did in
2000."</TE>
<TE>   Woods: "[Winning the U.S. Open] would be great, not only for
myself, but for the [Tiger Woods] Foundation."</TE>
<TE>   Interpretation: Winning the U.S. Open would be my eighth major
title and put me close to $37 million in earnings all over the world.
And thanks for lobbing up that softball question about the
foundation. I love that stuff, so keep 'em coming."</TE>
<TE>   Woods: "Hopefully our country can make it all the way [in the
World Cup]."</TE>
<TE>   Interpretation: "Hopefully this is the only soccer question I will
get. I have to tell you, I don't follow it very closely. Is Pele
still playing?"</TE>
<TE>   Woods: "I think it's special for all of the players to play on a
public golf course."</TE>
<TE>   Interpretation: "I think it's the first time most of these guys
have ever set foot on a public golf course, not when there are
country clubs around."</TE>
<TE>   Woods: "I think the changes [in the game since I won my first
major] that have happened the most, I think the golf balls have
improved as well as the driver heads have gotten bigger."</TE>
<TE>   Interpretation: "I think the changes in the game since I won my
first major is that I've won six of the last 10 majors and my head
hasn't gotten any bigger. I'm still pretty normal for a guy worth,
what, a few hundred mil?''</TE>
<TE>   Woods: "I think it's just nice to get some rest and prepare and
clear my mind [when I take two weeks off before a major]."</TE>
<TE>   Interpretation: "I need two weeks off before a major to figure out
how I'm going to spend the money."</TE>
<TE>   Money Update</TE>
<TE>   The purse is going up at next year's Buick Invitational at Torrey
Pines in La Jolla, from $3.6 million to $4.5 million. It's expected
to be $5.5 million in 2006. What this means for the Nissan Open at
Riviera Country Club is that it has to keep pace.</TE>
<TE>   The Nissan Open purse was $3.7 million this year, and it will have
the lowest purse of any event on the West Coast swing next year
unless there's an increase in the works.</TE>
<TE>   According to John Gill, director of Nissan Special Events, the
tournament will be "in the $5-[million] plus range" by the end of its
deal to sponsor the event in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Gill said the Nissan Open has signed a four-year agreement with
mortgage lender Countrywide to be a presenting sponsor and said part
of the money from that deal will be used to increase the purse and
predicts other tournaments will follow the same route.</TE>
<TE>   2008 and Counting</TE>
<TE>   The USGA made no announcement Wednesday regarding the site of the
2008 U.S. Open, which still is expected to be either Riviera or
Torrey Pines. There is no timetable for when the decision will be
made.</TE>
<TE>   Quote of the Week</TE>
<TE>   From Nick Faldo, playing in his 60th consecutive major, asked his
reaction to receiving a special exemption by the USGA:</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I kept bugging them on the phone."</TE>
<TE>   More Faldo</TE>
<TE>   He likes Bethpage Black. He called it a "monster diamond, a
monster gem."</TE>
<TE>   Faldo says that it has everything.</TE>
<TE>   "We have got length, accuracy, mega-thick rough, you've got
bunkers that are eight feet deep and you've got super fast greens.
Apart from that, it's dead easy."</TE>
<TE>   Tiger/Nike/Pressure</TE>
<TE>   Three of Tiger's new Nike Golf TV commercials air during the Open
and they're all black and white. In one of the spots, called
"Non-Negotiable," Woods says all he wants to do is win majors and
he'll do anything to accomplish it. He finishes by saying, "Think
they're feeling a little pressure out at Nike?"</TE>
<TE>   In another, titled "Contract," Woods says his deal with Nike is
that he can use other equipment if it's better. Says Woods: "How is
that for pressure?"</TE>
<TE>   Credit Nike for finding a fresh way of tackling what could be a
tricky issue and turning it into a positive.</TE>

<HD>Spain, Paraguay Move On</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spain continued its impressive march through the World Cup on
Wednesday, winning for the third time in as many games as forward
Raul scored twice to pace a 3-2 victory over South Africa in front of
31,024 in Daejeon, South Korea.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Jose Antonio Camacho's squad clinched first place in Group B
and will play Ireland on Sunday in the second round.</LD>
<LD>   "From now on it will be sudden death and Spain will play to win,"
Camacho said, as if there were a choice.</LD>
<TE>   The loss ousted South Africa from the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   South Africa might still have made it, but when Paraguay scored
its third goal in a 3-1 victory over Slovenia, it meant Paraguay
advanced with a better goal total after tying South Africa on points.</TE>
<TE>   "We did well, we showed guts," said South Africa Coach Jomo Sono,
whose team twice came from behind to tie Spain but could not manage
the trick a third time.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave away silly goals and got punished," Sono said, "but we
can't blame anybody."</TE>
<TE>   He could start by blaming goalkeeper Andre Arendse, who was
clearly at fault on two of the Spanish goals. First, he allowed the
ball to escape his grasp in the fourth minute, giving Raul the
easiest of open-net goals. Later, he was badly positioned and caught
flat-footed on a free-kick goal by Gaizka Mendieta seconds before
halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Each time South Africa responded, with Benni McCarthy scoring in
the 31st minute to cancel Raul's strike and Lucas Radebe heading home
another tying goal in the 53rd minute to keep South Africa alive.</TE>
<TE>   But Raul headed in the winner just three minutes later and this
time South Africa had no reply.</TE>
<TE>   "We are all disappointed, because Paraguay is not a team that
deserves to be in the second round," McCarthy said. South Africa had
come from behind to tie Paraguay, 2-2, earlier in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Paraguay 3, Slovenia 1--On a bleak day for Argentina, Paraguay
gave South American fans one reason to smile when it staged a
remarkable comeback to clinch a place in the second round.</TE>
<TE>   The victory, in front of 30,176 in Seogwipo, South Korea, tied
Paraguay on points with South Africa in Group B, and Paraguay
advanced to the round of 16 because it scored six goals in three
games compared to South Africa's five.</TE>
<TE>   The third Paraguayan goal was the clincher, and it came only six
minutes from the end of the game on a fierce 20-yard shot by Nelson
Cuevas that slammed into the underside of the crossbar before
rebounding down into the net.</TE>
<TE>   Making the comeback remarkable was the fact that Paraguay had to
play a man short for more than an hour after Carlos Paredes received
two yellow cards in the first 22 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Paraguay gave up a goal just before halftime when
Slovenia's Milenko Acimovic scored from a narrow angle with a shot
that goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert failed to handle properly.</TE>
<TE>   But Paraguay Coach Cesare Maldini made two key substitutions in
the second half, sending Jorge Campos on in the 54th minute and
Cuevas on in the 62nd minute. They produced all three goals.</TE>
<TE>   First, Cuevas made a superb run into the Slovenian penalty area,
finishing it with a shot just inside the left post. Then, Campos
blasted another shot past goalkeeper Mladen Dabanovic in the 73rd
minute. Then came Cuevas' goal that put Paraguay in the final 16.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to suffer in football and our team today suffered a lot,"
Maldini said. "We had to fight a lot in this match. We had some
difficulties, especially after Paredes went out, but our team is in
good physical condition and they play very well."</TE>
<TE>   Paraguay will play Germany in the second round.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be a very difficult match, as are all matches at the
World Cup," Maldini said. "We will relax, we have time to think about
it, and we will play as we know how and see what happens."</TE>

<LD>Trainer Richard Mandella had two impressive winners on Sunday,
scoring with debuting 2-year-old Gentlemen's Club and Palmarola, an
Argentine-bred who had run twice before in New York.</LD>
<LD>   Mandella, who had seven winners at the Hollywood Park meet through
Wednesday, will try to add to his total today when he sends out
Timely Action in the sixth.</LD>
<LD>   A $48,000 allowance at seven furlongs, the race attracted five
other entrants and Timely Action is one of only two coming off a
victory. Owned and bred by Herman Sarkowsky, the 3-year-old Gilded
Time colt broke his maiden by five lengths on May 18 in his first
race of the year. Alex Solis will ride.</LD>
<TE>   Doc's Allowance is the other participant coming off a victory. A
gelded son of Petionville owned by Everest Stables and trained by
Nick Canani, Doc's Allowance earned his first victory over this track
on May 10.</TE>
<TE>   Royal Moro, a gray gelding by With Approval, could be the one to
beat. Making his first start in nearly four months, Royal Moro
stumbled at the start of the Lazaro Barrera on May 27 and lost his
best chance. He wound up fourth, beaten by more than four lengths by
upset winner Captain Squire.</TE>
<TE>   The field is completed by Primerica, Music's Storm and longshot
Eggbert.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Speedy Pick, who almost won the San Luis Rey
Handicap at 58-1 the last time he ran 1 1/2 miles on the turf, will
take on Continental Stitch, Fade To Blue and six others in today's
seventh at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Laffit Pincay Jr. and David Flores. They began the week
at Hollywood Park winning at a 22% clip, higher than any other
jockeys.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Isaias Enriquez. The jockey is winless in 54 races at
Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Pacific Colony, High Tech
Exec and Honour The Game in the fifth, single Timely Action in the
sixth, use Continental Stitch and Fade To Blue in the seventh and
Martinis Atmidnite and Pit Drip in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 0/95. Money: Previous day/meet

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joel Pineiro (5-3) pitched a five-hitter for his first major league
shutout, leading the Seattle Mariners over the St. Louis Cardinals,
5-0, Wednesday night at Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   Mark McLemore and John Olerud hit home runs for the Mariners, who
also won an argument that cost the Cardinals a homer.</LD>
<LD>   St. Louis' Eli Marrero hit a drive into the left-field seats in
the sixth inning and third-base umpire Larry Vanover ruled it a fair
ball.</LD>
<TE>   But Seattle Manager Lou Piniella appealed and Vanover reversed the
call after consulting with the other umpires.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 7, Cleveland 3--Vicente Padilla (9-4) gave up nine
hits but worked out of jams for most of his 6 1/3 innings, leading
the Phillies at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Tempers flared briefly in the ninth when Phillie reliever Jose
Mesa drilled former teammate Omar Vizquel in the back with a pitch.
Mesa may be unhappy with Vizquel, who in his recently released
autobiography suggested that Mesa choked in Game 7 of the 1997 World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 10, Cincinnati 4--Rookie Kevin Mench hit a two-run single
and Michael Young had a bases-loaded triple as the Rangers rallied
for seven runs in the bottom of the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 7, Colorado 5--Frank Castillo (5-6) gave up five runs and
eight hits in 6 1/3 innings for his third victory in his last four
starts, despite three errors by the Red Sox at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Hampton (3-8) continued to struggle, giving up seven runs and
10 hits in five innings.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 2, Detroit 1--Vladimir Guerrero hit his 16th home run and
also scored on Andres Galarraga's 10th-inning single at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago White Sox 2, New York Mets 1--Tony Graffanino provided all
of Chicago's offense, hitting a home run and driving in the go-ahead
at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Piazza homered in the seventh inning.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 8, Milwaukee 0--Mark Mulder (6-4) gave up nine hits in his
first shutout this season, and Terrence Long drove in three runs as
the host Athletics won their seventh in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The A's are the only undefeated team in interleague play this
season.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 2, Baltimore 0--Brian Lawrence gave up five hits in
eight innings, and Ray Lankford drove in both runs at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence (7-3) became the fourth pitcher this season and 36th ever
to strike out the side on nine pitches, retiring Brook Fordyce, Jerry
Hairston and Melvin Mora in the third inning.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 13, Kansas City 5--Preston Wilson ended an 0-for-26 slump
with two homers and three runs batted in for the Marlins at Kansas
City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Marlin second baseman Luis Castillo singled in the third and in
the eighth, extending his hitting streak to 28 games, the longest
this season in the majors.</TE>

<HD>Irwindale Postpones Card After Fatality</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the aftermath of last week's stock car racing fatality, Irwindale
Speedway officials announced Wednesday that Saturday night's program
would be postponed while the retaining wall is being reconfigured.</LD>
<LD>   One of the two openings on the south side of the paved oval, where
cars enter the racing surface from the pit area, will be closed off,
adding 120 feet of wall to the existing outer barrier. It was near
this opening that John Baker of Tucson crashed his Chevrolet and was
killed during the NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Series race last
Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   "This was entirely our idea," said Jim Williams, president and
chief executive officer of the 4-year-old track. "I want to emphasize
that NASCAR did not tell us to make this change, nor was it even
suggested. Late Tuesday afternoon, in looking at the track, we
decided to close the opening, which was used very little anyway."</LD>
<TE>   The demolition derby and Figure 8 races scheduled for Saturday
night will be added to the NASCAR Fourth of July program on June 29.
All tickets purchased for this week's program will be honored at any
future event, track officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Racing on the half-mile oval will resume Saturday night, June 22.
Drag racing on the one-eighth mile strip tonight and Sunday will not
be affected.</TE>
<TE>   "This change is in keeping with our objective from Day 1, which is
to provide the safest possible racing environment for spectators and
competitors," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   The first of the two openings was built primarily to accommodate
open-wheel cars, which are push-started by trucks or other vehicles.
Stock cars, which have self-starters, use the opening nearer the
third turn to enter the track.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Coroner's office announced Wednesday that
an autopsy showed Baker's death was caused by a "basal skull
fracture." The 49-year-old driver was wearing a Hutchens
head-and-neck restraint when his Chevrolet hit the wall nearly
head-on early in the 150-lap K&amp;N Filter-sponsored race.</TE>

<HD>War Emblem's Owner Files Lawsuit Over Bonus</HD>

<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The majority owner of Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner War Emblem
has filed a lawsuit seeking the $1-million bonus for the colt's
victories in the Illinois and Kentucky derbies.</LD>
<LD>   The Thoroughbred Corp. filed the suit Monday in U.S. District
Court in Los Angeles against The National Jockey Club, which runs
Sportsman's Park, the Chicago racetrack that sponsored the bonus.</LD>
<LD>   The dispute is about who is entitled to the $1-million
bonus--Thoroughbred Corp. owner Prince Ahmed bin Salman or War
Emblem's previous owner, Russell Reineman, who retains a 10%
interest.</LD>
<TE>   Reineman was sole owner when the colt won the Illinois Derby on
April 6. Five days later, he sold a 90% interest in War Emblem to Bin
Salman, who paid $990,000 in cash, according to the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks later, War Emblem won the Kentucky Derby, which
triggered the Sportsman's Park bonus. Reineman contends he's entitled
to half of the $1 million. The Thoroughbred Corp. says it should
receive all of the money because it owned 90% of War Emblem when he
won the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   On May 30, Sportsman's Park told The Thoroughbred Corp. that it
would not pay the bonus because Reineman had sent a letter claiming
he was entitled to the entire $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   The friend of a woman allegedly drugged and raped by two men while
Oakland Raider defensive tackle Darrell Russell videotaped the attack
testified that she felt "weird" after tasting the drink prosecutors
say was spiked by Russell.</TE>
<TE>   The testimony came in the third day of Russell's preliminary
hearing in Alameda County Superior Court. Prosecutors allege Russell
spiked the drink with a date-rape drug .</TE>
<TE>   Russell is charged with 25 felonies as an accomplice to his
friends, Na'eem Perry and Ali Hayes, who appear on the videotape. The
three men have pleaded not guilty.</TE>

<HD>Edwards Hoping for King-Sized Comeback</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The Carolina Hurricanes may be facing the Detroit Red Wings in the
playoffs for the first time, but that's not the case for goaltending
coach Don Edwards, an assistant for the Kings the previous six
seasons.</LD>
<LD>   For the third season in a row, Edwards is coaching against Detroit
in the playoffs, and he knows that it's possible to come back against
the Red Wings, who have a 3-1 series lead with Game 5 tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Last season, the Kings fell behind in games, 2-0, to Detroit in
the first round but came back to win four in a row.</LD>
<TE>   "The style that they play really hasn't changed very much ... but
they just have more high-skilled guys to work with," Edwards said.</TE>
<TE>   "Having faced these guys for three years in a row, their team as a
whole has changed because of their depth. In years prior, they had
two lines to throw at you, and now, you look at their fourth line,
that line would match up with a lot of top lines around the league."</TE>
<TE>   For the Hurricanes to extend their season, they will need a huge
effort from goalie Arturs Irbe, who gave up three goals in Detroit's
Game 4 victory Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that he's played a bad game in the series," Edwards
said. "He's been handling the puck a lot less and we need that so we
can slow the game down enough for us to make changes.</TE>
<TE>   "We just have to keep the game simple. We'll make some slight
changes with our system to counteract Detroit's strengths.... But
we're certainly not discouraged."</TE>

<KH>Helene Elliott ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>Bowman May Lack Zen but Not Winning Touch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They couldn't be more different. Laker Coach Phil Jackson, the NBA's
Zen Master, trendy soul patch sprouting under his lower lip, and
Detroit Red Wing Coach Scotty Bowman, irascible Mr. Spacely from "The
Jetsons" cartoons come to life, chin pointed skyward, eyes seeing and
mind resolving problems that haven't arisen yet.</LD>
<LD>   One is Gandhi. The other is Stephen Hawking. Both are brilliant,
and both are apt to leave listeners feeling they've been in the
presence of genius but not quite sure what they'd just heard.</LD>
<LD>   Although their personalities stand in stark contrast, Jackson and
Bowman share several traits beyond being lucky enough to coach teams
led by superstars. And those traits make them uniquely suited to
succeed in an era when the hammer of authority is firmly in the grasp
of players, not management, and the playoffs are a two-month grind
tacked onto a seemingly interminable season.</LD>
<TE>   Tonight, a day after Jackson tied Red Auerbach's record of nine
league titles as a coach, Bowman can win his ninth Stanley Cup
championship as a coach, breaking the record Toe Blake set with the
Montreal Canadiens.</TE>
<TE>   Is it an affront to Auerbach or Blake to mention Jackson and
Bowman in the same breath, or do they deserve the same reverence?</TE>
<TE>   We often view Auerbach, the brash New Yorker, and Blake, the
self-made man who coached as intensely as he'd played during a
standout career, through the prism of nostalgia (and clouds of cigar
smoke).</TE>
<TE>   Their mystique is undeniable but impenetrable, because 24-hour
news channels, tell-all Web sites and sports-talk shows hadn't been
invented yet to dish dirt and argue arcane points. It's tempting to
exalt them and disdain the familiar, but that would be wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Bowman, like Jackson, is a master of head games. Both know when to
stroke and when to go to the whip, when to prod and when to praise.
In Montreal, where Bowman won five Stanley Cup titles in eight
seasons, he was blessed with boundless talent, as was Jackson with
the Chicago Bulls. But like Jackson, Bowman has the knack of managing
oversized personalities so well that players don't see the
puppeteers' strings.</TE>
<TE>   Auerbach still bleeds Celtic green in his 80s and snipes at
Jackson while downplaying the Laker coach's achievements. Blake died
of Alzheimer's disease in 1995 and can't deliver a sermon from the
hockey mount. But it's likely he would applaud and appreciate
Bowman's ability to adapt to the times while holding onto his core
convictions.</TE>
<TE>   When Blake took over for Dick Irvin before the 1955-56 season, he
inherited a Montreal team with 10 future Hall of Fame players. He won
eight Stanley Cup titles in 13 seasons, five in his first five
seasons, and 500 of 914 regular-season games.</TE>
<TE>   But there was more to Blake's success than sending majestic center
Jean Beliveau over the boards or avoiding goaltender Jacques Plante
on game days.</TE>
<TE>   Blake had to balance sense and sensibility, heeding French and
English sentiment in a culturally divided city. As the great players
of the 1950s aged and the Maurice Richard era ended, he had to break
in the youngsters who would lead the team in the next decade, such as
Jacques Laperriere and J.C. Tremblay.</TE>
<TE>   Blake worked wonders with Richard, convincing the aging firebrand
that he need not carry the team by himself and persuading him to let
teammates share the load. He won Richard's loyalty, no small feat,
and the support of French and English critics.</TE>
<TE>   Brusque and self-assured, Blake was something of a tyrant, which
wasn't unusual in that era. Coaches had more power over players in a
six- or 12-team league, before agents lobbied to get clients playing
time and long-term contracts. For the player given a
my-way-or-the-highway ultimatum by a coach, that highway often led to
Nowheresville.</TE>
<TE>   Bowman had an authoritarian streak for many years, and a short
fuse. That's not surprising.</TE>
<TE>   He was a student of Blake's Canadiens, having played for Blake at
the junior level in Montreal and later having coached in the
Canadiens' system. Bowman also coached the St. Louis Blues in 1968,
losing the Cup finale to Blake in the master's last triumph before
retirement.</TE>
<TE>   In his early years with St. Louis and especially in Montreal,
Bowman distanced himself from his players. He was a mystery to them,
revealing too little instead of too much. They might not have known
what he did in his spare time, but they knew he spent nearly every
waking moment looking for an angle that would give them a better
chance to win. That's one aspect they never questioned.</TE>
<TE>   He had Ken Dryden, Guy Lafleur, Larry Robinson--Hall of Famers
all. But Bowman got more out of his role players than those players
knew they had. He believed in them, though he didn't show it in
conventional ways. They had no choice but to believe in him, and with
good reason.</TE>
<TE>   Bowman displayed a new sensitivity in Pittsburgh, where he
succeeded the eternally sunny Bob Johnson when Johnson became fatally
ill during the 1991-92 season. Bowman, who had been the Penguins'
director of player development, knew that cracking the whip might
have fractured the team. Yes, he had Mario Lemieux, Jaromir Jagr and
Ron Francis, but other coaches hadn't won with that trio. The
Penguins won a second successive title for Bowman, and haven't come
close since.</TE>
<TE>   Blake would have appreciated how Bowman transformed Steve Yzerman
into one of the NHL's best all-around players. Bowman showed Yzerman
that by sacrificing points for sound defense, he and the team would
gain in the end.</TE>
<TE>   Blake would also have appreciated Bowman's relationship with
brilliant Russian Sergei Fedorov.</TE>
<TE>   Bowman has moved him from center to wing to defense, cutting his
playing time then abruptly wearing him out, knowing Fedorov would
learn and grow from each new situation.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings don't have the NHL's highest payroll, but they might
have the smartest, in terms of hockey sense.</TE>
<TE>   It has taken Bowman 29 seasons and five teams to reach the summit
where Blake once stood alone. But in an over-expanded league, and the
entry draft and limited revenues mitigating against the establishment
of dynasties, Bowman's accomplishments are no less impressive.</TE>
<TE>   By nature of its lower profile, anything that happens in the NHL
happens in relative obscurity. But for every glowing word tossed at
Jackson, save one for Bowman too. And lift a toast to Toe Blake,
watching from heaven's Hot Stove league.</TE>

<LD>The Houston Astros got a boost when Mark Prior left the game after
the sixth inning Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Craig Biggio hit a two-run single, and Jeff Bagwell had a go-ahead
sacrifice fly in a three-run seventh inning, rallying the Astros to a
5-4 victory over the Chicago Cubs.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe it was fortunate for us that they took [Prior] out,"
Manager Jimy Williams said. "We had some good at-bats after that. He
threw his breaking ball on 3-2 counts. He threw his change-up when he
was behind in the count."</LD>
<TE>   Prior, a former USC All-American making his fifth major league
start, left with a 4-2 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Sammy Sosa hit a three-run homer, his league leading 24th, against
Roy Oswalt (7-4) in the third inning.</TE>
<TE>   "[Prior] was dominating at times out there and it was really nice
for us to get to their pen," Bagwell said.</TE>

<DL>NORFOLK, Va.</DL>
<LD>Even at 52, Larry Holmes said, "I still got that fast, lightning left
jab," and he plans to prove it July 27 when he fights Eric
"Butterbean" Esch in a one-fight comeback.</LD>
<LD>   Holmes, the former heavyweight champion, will be fighting for the
first time since Nov. 17, 2000, when he knocked out Mike Weaver in
the sixth round.</LD>
<LD>   Holmes said he's in good shape financially and is returning to the
ring "because I want to. I have all these things, but I still want to
fight and I still can fight."</LD>
<TE>   Holmes said he's going to make $250,000 from the bout; Esch, 35,
declined to reveal what he will be paid.</TE>
<TE>   Esch, 6 feet, 355 pounds, is a former Toughman competition
champion who has become known as the "King of the Four-Rounders" in
his seven years as a professional. In Esch's last fight on May 5, he
knocked out Weaver in four rounds.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-round fight, announced Wednesday, was ostensibly set up to
settle a score between the fighters after Holmes wrote in his book,
"Against the Odds," that boxers such as Esch have no place in the
sport.</TE>

<DH>No one is sure what to expect from Bethpage Black, a
difficult course made tougher this week</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FARMINGDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Warning: This is an extremely difficult story that we recommend only
for highly skilled readers.</LD>
<LD>   Bethpage Black might be the only golf course in America that comes
with its own warning label, so maybe it should follow that everything
associated with this week's 102nd U.S. Open Championship come with
caveats.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Open, by edict, is supposed to be the supreme test for
golfers, yet, at 7,214 yards, Bethpage could be remembered as the
long walk spoiled.</LD>
<TE>   A disclaimer: This Open is the first to be played on a fully
public course, yet don't think for a minute this equates to a romp at
your local muni. No one here is playing in tennis shoes or hitting
off mats.</TE>
<TE>   The idea in coming to Bethpage was sort of a big-picture,
feel-good endeavor to celebrate golf's roots and placate the plebes,
take the sport back to the people who play golf without caddies or
swing doctors.</TE>
<TE>   This year's Open, which begins today, can be viewed as an ode to
inclusion and multi-ethnicity and in particular to Tiger Woods, a kid
who grew up playing par-three courses in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't able to play country clubs," Woods said this week. "We
didn't have the money."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Woods and the other 155 entrants this week want to make clear
that Bethpage isn't your average pitch-and-putt. In other words,
kids, do not try this at home.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really know if the golfing public who plays here every
day would want to have it set up like this every day for them," Woods
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bethpage was already an extremely difficult course before designer
Rees Jones took over and squeezed the birdies out of it with an
overhaul some have compared to an artistic restoration.</TE>
<TE>   The fun part of this week is the perception that people in the
gallery, the local New Yawkers, can somehow feel the golfers'
pain--Yo, Tiger, don't sweat it, I double-bogeyed No. 14 too!</TE>
<TE>   More than 30,000 hackers trample each year on Bethpage Black, for
as little as $31 on weekdays, with many of the course's devotees
camping out overnight for a tee time.</TE>
<TE>   During a practice round this week, one fan hollered at Phil
Mickelson, "Hey, I'd like to see you play after spending the night in
your car!"</TE>
<TE>   This backdrop provides for a unique intimacy and mystery. There is
no precedent at Bethpage, no magical shots from yesteryear to frame
the event the way Watson's chip shot on 17 in 1982 has always framed
the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach.</TE>
<TE>   But make no mistake: This week will not be a public picnic.</TE>
<TE>   It is the deepest ongoing desire of the U.S. Golf Assn. to make
the Open, if not a dance with the devil, at least a boogie with
bogey, an event in which embarrassment is par for the course.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way to keep us from shooting under par is to make it
ridiculously hard," Davis Love III said.</TE>
<TE>   In the same way steroids have altered the integrity of baseball,
technology advances in golf have threatened the majors. Augusta
National has struggled mightily to keep up with the titanic and
titanium tee shots.</TE>
<TE>   All hope seemed lost when Woods pistol-whipped the field and the
course at venerable Pebble Beach when he won the 2000 U.S. Open there
by 15 shots.</TE>
<TE>   The USGA would do almost anything to avoid that kind of undressing
again.</TE>
<TE>   It's doubtful anyone would welcome a revisit of 1974, when Hale
Irwin won at seven over par in what became known as "Massacre at
Winged Foot," yet the choice of Bethpage and its subsequent rigging
has all but assured Sunday's winner won't be under par by double
digits.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is the most nerve-racking tournament in the world,"
Sergio Garcia said. "I think it's the toughest, probably the toughest
tournament in the world, playing without wind. If the wind blows at
the British Open, it gets really tough. But playing without wind
anywhere in the world, I think this is the toughest tournament."</TE>
<TE>   Not that there's anything wrong with that.</TE>
<TE>   It is by design and with forethought that an impostor does not
take home this trophy.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday ought to produce a champion with a name everyone can
pronounce, even if that name is as tongue-tying as Jose Maria
Olazabal.</TE>
<TE>   It would be a bulletin if some Paul Lawrie type sneaked in to
steal this major.</TE>
<TE>   This is an Open where you round up the usual suspects: Tiger
Woods, Ernie Els, Phil Mickelson, Vijay Singh, David Duval, David
Toms, Sergio Garcia and defending champion Retief Goosen.</TE>
<TE>   Even though some, including NBC commentator Johnny Miller, think
the U.S. Open is the most difficult of the four majors for Woods to
win, you have to start any prognostication with Tiger based on the
fact he has won six of the last 10 majors and is far and away the
world's best player.</TE>
<TE>   Woods is trying to become only the fifth player to win the Masters
and U.S. Open in the same year, joining Craig Wood (1941), Ben Hogan
('51, '53), Arnold Palmer (1960) and Jack Nicklaus (1972).</TE>
<TE>   Els is a two-time champion, but his sweet swing has required help
lately from coach David Leadbetter.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's not a good sign that Els was last heard describing
Bethpage as a "torture chamber."</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson is always a consideration with that picture-perfect
swing, yet the pressure of winning his first major championship
always looms.</TE>
<TE>   If members of the left-handers society are looking for omens,
brother Phil turns 32 on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   You think Mickelson wouldn't like to blow out the candle on this
cake?</TE>
<TE>   Garcia has five top-10 finishes this year, yet is remembered for
shooting a final-day 77 to take him out of last year's competition at
Southern Hills in Tulsa.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia does not lack for confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what I can do and I know that if I'm on top of my game, I
can beat anybody," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Duval has been in a funk since winning his first major last summer
at the British Open. He has missed the cut four times this year,
although he showed signs of renewal with a recent fourth-place finish
at the Memorial.</TE>
<TE>   Olazabal has not been top drawer at recent U.S. Opens--his last
top-10 finish came in 1991--yet he has momentum with seven top-10
finishes this year.</TE>
<TE>   Singh always comes out slinging at majors, although he has missed
the cut in two of his last four tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   David Toms? Not a bad sleeper pick. The 2001 PGA Championship
winner has three top-10s in his last four events.</TE>
<TE>   Goosen has history against him. No U.S. Open winner has repeated
since Curtis Strange in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the way Bethpage is playing--Woods and Spain (Garcia),
then pray for rain?--Goosen isn't sure he'd sleep in his car to
secure a future tee time.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope the normal guys don't play it like this all the time,"
Goosen said. "They'd probably need six dozen balls to get around 18
holes."</TE>

<HD>Out With the Old, In With the New</HD>
<DH>Group F: After tie against Sweden, Argentina eliminated in
opening round for the first time in 40 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Welcome to the new World Cup order:</LD>
<LD>   France and Argentina are out.</LD>
<LD>   Scandinavia is in.</LD>
<TE>   Twenty-four hours after Denmark eliminated defending champion
France in the first round, Sweden did the same to tournament
co-favorite Argentina Wednesday by scoring once, on a 59th-minute
free kick by Anders Svensson, and then holding on for a 1-1 tie in
Miyagi, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   The draw, coupled with England's scoreless tie with Nigeria, gave
Sweden first place in Group F, the so-called "Group of Death," while
ending Argentina's World Cup in the first round for the first time
since 1962.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody expected us to get a point from the 'Group of Death,' "
said Sweden goalkeeper Magnus Hedman, who repeatedly frustrated the
Argentines with his quick reflexes in front of the net, "and we have
gone on and won it."</TE>
<TE>   Sweden and England both finished with five points at 1-0-2, with a
plus-one goal differential and played to a 1-1 tie when they met in
Saitama. Sweden takes first in the group by virtue of scoring more
goals--four to England's two.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina, which dominated South American World Cup qualification
play and arrived in Japan with a roster stocked with some of the best
attacking talent in the sport, managed but two goals in its three
games--the second coming in the 88th minute against Sweden, on a
penalty rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Svensson's curling free kick, which hooked the upper left corner
from 30 yards, came against the run of play. Argentina squandered
numerous chances in the first half and outshot the Swedes, 15-7, for
the match--although only four of those attempts were on target.</TE>
<TE>   After Coach Marcelo Bielsa sent on substitutes Hernan Crespo and
Claudio Caniggia in the second half, Argentina pressed forward with
greater urgency. But Hedman and a composed Swedish back line blunted
every challenge, until the 88th minute, when Mattias Jonson was cited
for a foul on Ariel Ortega in the box.</TE>
<TE>   Hedman blocked Ortega's penalty kick, but the rebound ricocheted
straight to Crespo, who fired past Hedman. Coming only minutes from
time, it was an academic goal, with the Swedes soon celebrating a
most improbable first-place finish.</TE>
<TE>   Svensson described his goal as "the best thing that's happened to
me in my career. When I saw the ball going in, I went crazy.... It
was incredible, [coming against] probably the best team I have ever
played against."</TE>
<TE>   After the goal, Sweden was faced with a more demanding assignment:
trying to protect the lead for a frantic final half-hour.</TE>
<TE>   "After we got our goal, they put us back on defense for a long,
long time," Sweden Co-Coach Lars Lagerback said. "It showed the
players' character, and Magnus Hedman made some good saves."</TE>
<TE>   Argentina finished third in the group with four points at 1-1-1.
Sweden next plays Group A runner-up Senegal in a second-round game
Sunday in Oita, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "We are full of confidence," Hedman said. "We know we can compete
with and maybe beat all the teams left in the way."</TE>

<HD>Transfer Requests Soaring</HD>
<DH>High schools: With tighter restrictions on eligibility
coming in 2003, a record number of athletes apply.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SONDHEIMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Legislation designed to curb an ever-growing swell of athletes
seeking to change high schools has instead prompted a record number
of transfer requests.</LD>
<LD>   The California Interscholastic Federation Southern Section, the
governing body for sports programs at 529 high schools in Southern
California, has received 7,331 athletic transfer requests for next
fall. That's an average of nearly 14 per school, an indication that
many families are engaged in a mad dash to beat the transfer clock.</LD>
<LD>   A rule that will be implemented in the fall of 2003 requires
athletes to sit out the next year of varsity competition if they
transfer without moving.</LD>
<TE>   "I would say there was a last-ditch effort to get kids in and make
them eligible," Downey High Principal Allen Layne said.</TE>
<TE>   Students had until May 15 to declare their intention to transfer
in order to have athletic eligibility under the current open
enrollment policy. Not that many will actually transfer, Southern
Section officials said, because some schools reported transfer
students who don't play sports in order to protect their eligibility
should they decide to go out for a team. Also, some students applied
to more than one school.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the number is shocking. In comparison, it is nearly double
the 3,800 athletes who transferred within the section from the fall
of 1999 until the first of this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a good thing," said Gary Murphy, retiring principal
at West Hills Chaminade and a leading proponent of transfer
restrictions. "The message is out and people realize things are going
to change. It's a surprisingly high number, but I expected people to
get in before the ax falls. It means people understand the winds are
changing."</TE>
<TE>   Brandi Kimble, an all-section forward for the Newhall Hart girls'
basketball team, is among the athletes who plan to switch schools.
The junior-to-be appears headed for Lynwood, the reigning state
girls' basketball champion, even though she will continue living in
Stevenson Ranch near Newhall--a 43-mile commute to her new school.</TE>
<TE>   Kimble's father, Bobby, said he probably would move his family if
the new rule were in place and his daughter would be forced to sit
out a year. He said Brandi got to know Lynwood players through club
competitions and she wants to test herself against the best teams and
players.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like [the rule], but I can understand it," Bobby Kimble
said. "Some of the transfers have to do with athletics, but others
are looking to go to schools for different reasons."</TE>
<TE>   The Southern Section will be first among the state's 10 sections
to impose transfer restrictions, reversing a philosophy of
encouraging student choice that went into effect shortly after the
state Legislature passed the open enrollment law in 1994. Open
enrollment gives parents the option to choose schools outside their
neighborhood for academic reasons, but administrators and coaches say
that flexibility has been used by thousands to change sports
programs.</TE>
<TE>   When revisions on transfer policies were voted on in April, only
11 league representatives out of more than 70 that comprise the
Southern Section council voted against the changes. The overwhelming
endorsement for transfer restrictions represents concerns that the
open enrollment process was being abused and threatened the stability
of high school sports.</TE>
<TE>   A remaining challenge is to find a balance between a parent's
right of school choice and the goal of trying to preserve
competitiveness in high school athletics.</TE>
<TE>   "I think in California, there's a significant movement toward
giving parents choice with the rise in charter schools, alternative
schools and home schools," said Clark Stephens, outgoing president of
the Southern Section council and principal at Huntington Beach
Liberty Christian. "It's obvious parents want a choice where to send
their kids. CIF is wrestling with that and how it impacts high school
athletics."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Suarez, a 6-foot-3, 245-pound tight end, chose to transfer
from La Puente Bassett to Hacienda Heights Los Altos last December.
He said he would not have made the transfer if he were forced to sit
out his senior season.</TE>
<TE>   "[Kids] should have a free choice no matter where you live for
education or sports reasons," Suarez said. "I don't think
restrictions should be included."</TE>
<TE>   Suarez said he is an example of someone who has benefited from
transferring schools.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been real good," he said. "My grades picked up and the
football team is great."</TE>
<TE>   Suarez simply filled out a form and switched schools. Soon, it
won't be that easy. Athletes will either have to move to gain
immediate athletic eligibility or spend a season on junior varsity.</TE>
<TE>   Basketball transfers, in particular, have provoked the wrath of
athletic administrators because of the constant movement of players
to top programs, creating virtual all-star teams. It's become almost
routine for a section champion to have at least one transfer on its
roster.</TE>
<TE>   This year's City Section and state champion in boys' basketball,
Westchester, had three transfers and none of its 12 players lived in
the school's attendance boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Other sections in the state have expressed similar frustrations.
In the Central Section, the Selma High boys' basketball team decided
to forfeit two league games against San Joaquin Memorial because it
believed that school broke transfer rules in admitting two star
players.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the Clovis Unified School District voted to make
foreign-exchange students who transfer into the district ineligible
to compete at the varsity level for one year, an action taken after
Clovis West had to forfeit 70 boys' basketball victories in 1998-99
and 1999-2000 for using a player from the Dominican Republic who was
found to be 19--too old to compete in high school sports--as a
sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   The City Section has scheduled a vote for next March to decide
whether to follow the Southern Section's lead with its own transfer
restrictions. City Section Commissioner Barbara Fiege said the
Southern Section transfer figure is "a good indication of the scope
of the problem" in high school sports.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same things we've been dealing with," Fiege said. "There
have been significant numbers of transfers and all the issues that go
with it, such as local students being displaced, the perception of
the creation of all-star teams, students changing schools after
beginning in one, the concept of loyalty, the opportunities for adult
inducements."</TE>

<KH>WORLD CUPFIRST ROUND</KH>
<HD>A World of Worries for U.S.</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Americans must contend with a prideful Polish squad
that will be cheered by Koreans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The thunderstorm that rolled across the city Wednesday provided a
suitable backdrop for the crackling drama unfolding around the United
States World Cup team.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. is only one point from securing a place in the second
round. All it needs is a tie in Daejeon, South Korea, on Friday
against Poland, which already has lost its first two games.</LD>
<LD>   But there are nagging worries in the back of the American players'
and coaches' minds.</LD>
<TE>   What if the Poles come out to play as they did during qualifying,
when they swept all before them in becoming the first European team
after automatic qualifier France to reach Korea/Japan '02?</TE>
<TE>   What if the U.S., which generally does better against teams it
should not defeat than against teams it should, suddenly can't score
a goal when it needs one?</TE>
<TE>   What if the unthinkable happens and the U.S. loses?</TE>
<TE>   Winger Earnie Stewart is certain that the Poles will not lack
motivation.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want to lose three games, and they're going to come
out and play as hard as they can to get a [positive] result," he
said. "You never want to go out with three losses.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't have any pressure, so that makes it easy on them too.
They can maybe attack a little bit more than they might have thought
about before. It's going to be a tough match. With two losses and no
pressure, it makes them a very dangerous opponent."</TE>
<TE>   Another factor comes into play.</TE>
<TE>   Poland's Jerzy Dudek, the goaltender the Americans will have to
beat, has a laudable reason for wanting to stop them.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to make a gift to the Korean people who looked after us
very well," Dudek told Agence France-Presse.</TE>
<TE>   Dudek can deliver that gift if he shuts out the U.S. and Poland
somehow manages to do what it has not yet done--score a goal. South
Korea would then reach the second round as long as it ties Portugal
or does not lose to the Portuguese by more than one goal.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, South Korea's prospects look bleak.</TE>
<TE>   A loss to Portugal and a U.S. tie or victory would make it the
first host nation in World Cup history to fail to advance to the
second round.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to make sense of the various permutations possible in Group
D would tax even the keenest mind.</TE>
<TE>   This was how U.S. Soccer described one scenario on Wednesday while
trying to fathom the various possibilities:</TE>
<TE>   "If the U.S. loses and Portugal tops Korea, the U.S. advances if
Korea's margin of defeat is two or more goals greater than the U.S.
margin of defeat or if Korea's margin of defeat is one more than the
U.S. margin of defeat and the U.S. maintains its edge in goals scored
[4-3 entering Friday's games]."</TE>
<TE>   Got that?</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Coach Bruce Arena claims not to be paying attention to any of
it. His focus is solely on what the Americans need to do to advance.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not planning on getting any updates," he said of the
Portugal-South Korea game in Incheon. "I'm sure I will get them ...
but it's not important.</TE>
<TE>   "What is important is that we focus on Poland and we try to win
the game. We're not going to count on anybody else to get us into the
second round but ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Arena and his assistants have been debating whether to rest a
player or two in anticipation of the second round, but the consensus
is that it would be too risky.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we need to put our best team on the field," Arena said.
"If we get too cute and try to play ahead, we're going to get
ourselves in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, it wouldn't hurt to give a couple of players a break
because it's possible--if we do advance--that we would play on
Monday, and that's a quick turnaround. It's something we've talked
about, but we won't play on Monday or Tuesday unless we win [or tie]
on Friday, and that's got to be our approach."</TE>
<TE>   The Poles present an entirely different challenge than the
Portuguese or Koreans. They are more physical, for one thing, and
have the height to test the U.S. defense in the air.</TE>
<TE>   "They had an outstanding run in qualifying," Arena said. "They
haven't shown their best in this World Cup and we anticipate that
they will against us on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "[Nigerian-born striker Emmanuel] Olisadebe was outstanding in
qualifying. His speed and his ability to get behind defenses was
something we saw in each and every game."</TE>
<TE>   Poland holds a 6-4-1 edge over the U.S. in a series that dates to
1924, but the countries have not played since 1990.</TE>

<HD>Mystics Full of Surprises</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The WNBA season is only three weeks old, but in a 32-game schedule
it's never too early to spot surprises and disappointments.</LD>
<LD>   Right now the biggest surprise is the 4-1 Washington Mystics. The
team had been crawling up the victory ladder--12-20 in 1999, 14-18 in
2000--but regressed last year to 10-22.</LD>
<LD>   New Coach Marianne Stanley junked the confusing half-court system
that Tom Maher had installed last season and told her team to run and
gun. Washington, not a very big team to begin with, has taken flight.</LD>
<TE>   Another key: Talented but mercurial star Chamique Holdsclaw has
matured (especially with her former Tennessee coach, Pat Summitt,
watching as a Mystic consultant). Holdsclaw is more willing to share
the ball with her teammates, and they are more willing to see their
budding superstar shine.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Stacey Dales-Schuman, the third pick in the draft, is
a solid second scorer at 15.2 points a game.</TE>
<TE>   Although Dales-Schuman did not work out as a point guard (17
turnovers against 12 assists), she is flourishing as a wing player
running the lanes, and she is an effective passer from the perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   Other early surprises include 4-2 Indiana--Tamika Catchings
appears to be as good as advertised--and 3-1 Phoenix, which will keep
improving the more fiery Coach Cynthia Cooper calms down.</TE>
<TE>   The disappointments? Sacramento and Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Last season these teams each won 20 games and made the playoffs.
Today Miami is 1-5 and Sacramento 0-4.</TE>
<TE>   Injuries have played a part in their troubles. But the winless
Monarchs, with a veteran nucleus, should not look this shabby even
without All-Star center Yolanda Griffith and key reserve Edna
Campbell.</TE>
<TE>   Scoring has been spotty at best for Sacramento. In 2001 the
Monarchs were a respectable 42.4% from the field. That figure has
dipped to 38% in 2002, with no player averaging more than 12 points.</TE>
<TE>   With the East having more parity among its eight teams, the Sol
can recover from injuries and still rise from the cellar to battle
for a playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   TV Deal</TE>
<TE>   The WNBA has entered a six-year agreement with ABC and ESPN to
televise regular-season and playoff games, beginning in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   ABC will broadcast regular-season and playoff games on Saturday
afternoons. Under the current contract, NBC shows 10 regular-season
games, plus as many five as postseason games.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN and ESPN2, which have shown games since the league began in
1997, extended the current agreement six years. In addition to
regular-season and playoff games, ESPN will continue to broadcast the
WNBA All-Star Game and WNBA draft. ESPN2 will also develop a
half-hour show preceding each telecast.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's three WNBA telecasts have averaged a 1.2 national rating,
down 8% from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The WNBA recently signed a two-year contract with the Oxygen cable
channel, calling for 11 regular-season telecasts this season and an
unspecified number next season.</TE>

<HD>GAME 4 REPORT</HD>
<DH>Charting The Lead: A look at the Lakers' lead or deficit by
the minute</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FIRST QUARTER</LD>
<LD>   Highlight reel: So which was the team with the three-games-to-none
lead again? Oh, right. The Nets came out and played like a team
brimming with confidence instead of a club derided as perhaps the
most overmatched opponent in Finals history. Kenyon Martin was
unstoppable, making short jump shots, hooks and banks. He even made a
shot from beyond the free-throw line, when he was left by himself. He
torched the Lakers, and Robert Horry in particular, scoring 17 points
on eight-for-13 shooting in leading the Nets to their best quarter of
the Finals. Too little too late?</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: Where was this spark to start the series?
The Nets finally looked relaxed and reaped the benefits of their
newfound confidence. With nothing to lose, they played as if the game
meant nothing. No pressure, no nerves, no reasons to be uptight. They
seemed to be having fun at last. There was little doubt that the
Lakers and the pressure of the Finals got to the Nets in the first
three games.</LD>
<TE>   Winning number: Martin's 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: Net center Todd MacCulloch picked up two quick
fouls.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Shaquille O'Neal 12, Kobe Bryant 6;
Nets--Martin 17, Kerry Kittles 5.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 4; Nets--Martin, MacCulloch and
Keith Van Horn 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SECOND QUARTER</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: The Lakers awoke with a start to open this
quarter, erasing what had been a double-digit deficit late in the
first quarter. As ever, O'Neal led them, but Devean George entered
the game and made it clear he wished to return to Southern California
as soon as possible. George made a three-point basket that got the
Lakers within 39-37. Later, he made a jumper and another
three-pointer, putting the Lakers ahead, 52-47. They held the lead
for the rest of this quarter, but couldn't pull away, as the Nets
scored the last five points.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: The Lakers' resolve has been tested
repeatedly during this postseason. To be sure, they have won
consistently in the playoffs but have rarely routed opponents. This
quarter figured to be a pivotal one. With the Nets surging to start
the game, the Lakers needed to keep their razor-sharp focus if they
hoped to put the finishing touches on the series and take their first
Finals sweep.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: The Lakers held Martin to one point in eight
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: The Nets were outrebounded (again!), 12-9.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--George 8, O'Neal 6; Nets--Lucious Harris
9, Richard Jefferson 5.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--George 4; Nets--Jason Kidd 3, Martin
2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THIRD QUARTER</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: With his team teetering on the brink late in this
quarter, trailing by eight points, Kidd went to work. He made one
jump shot, then another with a sweet kiss off the backboard. A third
jumper moments before the buzzer was off the mark. That said a great
deal about Kidd and the Nets in the final analysis. They were good
enough to get this far, but when it came to doing some damage, taking
a game from the Lakers, for instance, they came up short. Kidd led
the Nets to their first appearance in the Finals, but he didn't have
quite enough help to get past the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Like three teams before them, the Nets had
no answer for O'Neal. He was too big, too strong and too skilled. The
Nets' collapsing zone troubled the Lakers for short stretches, but
O'Neal never pressed the issue. When he was well defended, he merely
slipped the ball to the perimeter, and Robert Horry and Rick Fox made
the shots that kept the Lakers in front.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: The Lakers' eight-for-16 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: The Nets' nine-for-24 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 10, Horry 7; Nets--Kidd and
Kittles 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 4, Derek Fisher 3; Nets--Martin
5, MacCulloch 4.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH QUARTER</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Bryant gliding toward the hoop, slicing past
Harris and dropping in a layup that gave the Lakers a 104-95 lead
with 3:32 to play. Timeout, Nets. O'Neal tosses in short jumper in
the lane. Another timeout. The end is at hand. The three-peat has
been accomplished. Anyone for four in a row? It's not out of the
question. With a little fine-tuning, the Lakers could go for four,
five, six, maybe more. The best could be still to come. No one has a
combo quite like O'Neal and Bryant, a point that has become more and
more evident.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Coach Phil Jackson's classy move to get
Mitch Richmond into the game for the final minute. Richmond played
only a few seconds of the series against Sacramento. After 14 seasons
of mostly losing basketball, Richmond finally is a champion. He made
a short jump shot for the Lakers' last points and, more importantly,
drew the honor of dribbling away the final seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: Three-peat, the Lakers' first in Los Angeles and
second in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: Zero, the number of Net victories.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 11, O'Neal 6; Nets--Martin 13,
Harris 11.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Bryant 3, George and O'Neal 2;
Nets--Jason Collins 3, Martin and Jefferson 2.</TE>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Now to rebuild the perfect beast.</LD>
<LD>   Having won three titles in a row, the Lakers will now try to get
better, having seen their comfort margin cut to millimeters by the
Sacramento Kings in the Western Conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   With Shaquille O'Neal missing 15 games during the season and
struggling early in the playoffs, they would like to add another big
man. One they're considering is Charles Oakley, who played last
season with the Chicago Bulls but is a free agent and has been
talking about coming to the Lakers for years. A tough defender with
an attitude and sharp tongue, he'd work well with the Lakers, who
were so lackadaisical this season.</LD>
<TE>   Jackson is also looking for a guard to play his "initiator" spot,
which Kobe Bryant had to handle much of the season. This would
probably be some kind of a young Ron Harper.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the nucleus is expected back but with seven potential free
agents, not all of them will be.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how it looks:</TE>
<TE>   * O'Neal (four more seasons under contract at an average of $26.25
million)--Here's how good he was: Weighing at least 345 pounds, with
sore feet, he turned back into his dominating self in Games 6 and 7
of the West finals, then won his third Finals MVP in a row. Big
questions: Can he find relief for his arthritic right big toe? Will
he come back next fall as heavy as he has the last two?</TE>
<TE>   * Bryant (three seasons at an average of $13.5 million)--Just your
basic season for the Laker phenom. He made another quantum move,
becoming a solid team player and a full-fledged member of the team,
which was all that was missing. At 23, he has three titles and is
getting better. Now he gets along with Shaq, so the sky's the limit.</TE>
<TE>   * Robert Horry (two seasons at $5.3 million each)--Ultimate
specialist, comes alive in the playoffs, as evidenced by his
three-point shots to win big games (he beat the Portland Trail
Blazers in Game 3 in the first round and saved the Lakers against the
Kings with one in Game 4 of the West finals). He still has trouble
defending big guys such as Tim Duncan and Chris Webber in the post.
If they had someone like Oakley, they could bring Horry off the bench
again, where he's most effective.</TE>
<TE>   * Rick Fox (three seasons at an average of $4.7 million)--Solid
defender with chip-on-his-shoulder attitude, runs the triangle well
and talks trash during the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   * Lindsey Hunter (two years at an average of $4.1 million, unless
he opts out)--They took on his big contract last summer after
learning Derek Fisher would need surgery again. Hunter played well
early but slumped late, then shot 31% in the playoffs while playing
seven minutes a game. They will probably move him if they can find a
taker, which is unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   * Fisher (three seasons at $3 million each)--Had a fine season,
averaging 11 points and shooting 41% from three-point range.
Struggled in the playoffs against San Antonio's Tony Parker and
Sacramento's Mike Bibby, but bounced back to average 10 points and
shoot 52% in the Finals. Tough, competitive and usually one of the
Lakers' best outside shooters.</TE>
<TE>   * Samaki Walker (one season at $1.54 million, unless he opts
out)--Good athlete and played OK. If the Lakers bring in another
power forward, he might opt out.</TE>
<TE>   * Mark Madsen (one season at $813,000 before becoming a restricted
free agent in 2003)--Not a good player but a great effort/attitude
guy who fits in well at the end of the bench. Although willing, he's
short (6 feet 8) for a power forward and he has to learn to shoot to
get more time.</TE>
<TE>   * Devean George (unrestricted free agent)--These playoffs may have
cost him $4 million a year as a free agent. Slumped through the
postseason but his 11-point, six-rebound performance in Game 4 was
more indicative of what he can do. Good defender and an improving
outside shooter. Lakers want him back but the question is, will he
get any big offers? Probably not.</TE>
<TE>   * Brian Shaw (unrestricted free agent)--Jackson's security
blanket. At 36, he makes good decisions and makes big shots, even
with minimal opportunities. His willingness to play for the
$1-million veteran's minimum takes pressure off the team's salary cap
too.</TE>
<TE>   * Slava Medvedenko (restricted free agent)--Their Ukranian secret
weapon is 6-11, with decent skills and toughness. Still learning the
game as well as the language, but they hope to retain him.</TE>
<TE>   * Mitch Richmond (unrestricted free agent)--He was in the right
place but it must have been the wrong time. He's about to turn 37 and
they didn't think he picked up the offense fast enough, or was quick
enough to defend. May not be back.</TE>
<TE>   * Jelani McCoy (unrestricted free agent)--They're always looking
for young big guys they can develop, but he spent most of the season
on the injured list and he wasn't injured.</TE>

<LD>All that's left for the Lakers now is their championship celebration
and victory parade on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Festivities will begin at 11:07 a.m. at City Hall, where Laker and
city officials will speak. The parade, scheduled to begin at 11:30,
will go from City Hall, west on Second to Figueroa and continue down
to Staples Center. The celebration there is scheduled to begin at
12:50.</LD>
<LD>   The parade will be led by a police drill team brigade, followed by
two fire trucks carrying the Laker band. Grand marshal Chick Hearn
and his wife, Marge, will be riding in a convertible, followed by
four convertibles carrying the Laker girls.</LD>
<TE>   Laker players, coaches, staff members and city officials will
follow in 11 double-decker buses. A car carrying Mayor James Hahn
will follow the buses.</TE>
<TE>   Most L.A. over-the-air television stations, plus Fox Sports Net,
will cover the parade. The coverage on Laker flagship stations
Channel 9 and Fox Sports Net will begin at 10:30 a.m.</TE>

<TE>   Robert Horry is considering moving his family to Los Angeles for
larger portions of the regular season, a decision that could make him
much more likely to play to the end of his contract.</TE>
<TE>   Horry has two seasons remaining on his deal with the Lakers, both
for $5.3 million per, the second at the team's option.</TE>
<TE>   Asked Wednesday if there were any doubt he would return next
season, he said, "Maybe," an ambiguity based on, "A little bit of
this, a little bit of that. Family."</TE>
<TE>   Horry's 9-year-old daughter, Ashlyn, has a neurological disorder
similar to cerebral palsy. The family lives in Houston, where it has
become close to doctors and therapists who have known Ashlyn since
birth.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to take some pressure off the wife," Horry said of Keva.
"I mean, she would never say anything. She knows this keeps me sane
and brings me a little bit of joy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tex Winter, Phil Jackson's assistant since 1990, said he likely
would retire. Winter, who turned 80 in February, has coached the last
55 years.... Horry, who has played for five championship teams, is
the first to play for two teams to sweep the Finals. In 1995, his
Houston Rockets swept the Orlando Magic. Shaquille O'Neal and Brian
Shaw, members of that Magic team, become the fourth and fifth players
to both sweep and be swept. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jamaal Wilkes and
Mark McNamara are the others.... The Lakers shot 50.5% in the series,
the first team to shoot 50% or better in the Finals since the 1992
Chicago Bulls.</TE>

<KH>GAME 4 LAKERS 113, NEW JERSEY 107/Threedom Rings</KH>
<HD>O'Neal is a three-peat MVP as Lakers finally cut down the
Nets</HD>
<DH>Team Makes a Sweeping Statement for History Books</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The third championship came as the others did, on the shoulders of
Shaquille O'Neal, on the wings of Kobe Bryant, at the end of a season
they were sure of, if sometimes they were among the few who were.</LD>
<LD>   Late on Wednesday night, the Lakers stood finally at the end of
what they had played for since October, and pulled the joy of their
NBA championship not from large green bottles, but from the teammates
who sang with them in a locker room soaked in satisfaction.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers defeated the New Jersey Nets, 113-107, at Continental
Airlines Arena, where O'Neal handed his Finals MVP trophy--his third
in a row--to his teammates, and held his young daughter, Amirah,
instead.</LD>
<TE>   They won the best-of-seven series in four games, the first Finals
sweep by the Lakers, the seventh in league history and the first in
seven years, since O'Neal and his Orlando Magic were gone in four.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have won 14 championships, two fewer than the Boston
Celtics, and seem to be gaining momentum. O'Neal is 30. Bryant is 23.
They pushed into a cinder-block room crowded by teammates, who
chanted, "One, two, three! One, two, three!" And when O'Neal was
ready, corks banged off a tile ceiling, and he shouted hysterically
when the champagne came.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, who a year ago slumped in a shower stall by himself,
danced among them. Rick Fox held the game ball and a Bahamian flag.
Derek Fisher turned his cap backward and shrieked for his third, as
though it were his first.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers would party to dawn, fly mid-morning, and parade on
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We can see why the third time is the hardest," Fisher said. "But
here we are.</TE>
<TE>   "This started as a foregone conclusion. It didn't look that way as
we went forward. So, for our basketball team, the fact we didn't give
up makes it special. We fought through all of that."</TE>
<TE>   Often out in front of it, Phil Jackson won his ninth title as a
coach in his ninth Finals appearance, tying Celtic legend Red
Auerbach for the record. Afterward, Jackson lit a cigar, his own, and
surrounded himself with his four children in a small room between
locker rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my belief and my experience that the third victory in the
three successive years is always the most unique and the most
difficult one to fight your way through," he said. "This certainly
was this year."</TE>
<TE>   It came in a series billed as "Destiny vs. Dynasty," and the
people of New Jersey were shocked to discover they were up against
both.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal limped terribly through the season, and could face
off-season surgery to ease the pain from an arthritic toe. But he
strode forcefully into a series he was expected to control, averaged
36.3 points and shot 59.5%. He scored 34 points and took 10 rebounds
in Game 4, just enough to run off the Nets, game but for their
moments in the middle with O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   He became the second player to win three consecutive Finals MVP
awards. Michael Jordan did it twice last decade, also playing for
Jackson, also as the game's most dominant force.</TE>
<TE>   "It says we're a great team and everybody stuck to their role,
everybody stuck to the script, everybody believed," O'Neal said.
"Nobody ever got down, even, you know, when times were so-called
hard."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant scored 25 points, 11 while making four of six shots in the
fourth quarter. Fisher scored 13 points, Robert Horry scored 12 and
Devean George scored 11, including a three-pointer with just under
eight minutes remaining that gave the Lakers a 92-89 lead they never
gave back.</TE>
<TE>   Net forward Kenyon Martin scored 35 points, 13 in a taut fourth
quarter. The Nets, however, lacked a consistent inside game, and they
lacked O'Neal, or anyone like him.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal set records for a four-game series for points (145), free
throws made (45), free throws attempted (68) and blocks (11). As a
result, the Lakers won their record eighth consecutive Finals game.</TE>
<TE>   It all landed them in a huddle at midcourt, surrounded by friends
and relatives, drawn by three consecutive NBA titles. Asked to
consider the three, Bryant grinned.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all the same, all the same," he said. "The first one is,
it's all a novelty and it feels good. The first one will always be
the best one. The second one, the adversity we went through
throughout the course of the year made that one special.</TE>
<TE>   "And this one, it's kind of making us step in as one of the great
teams. It feels great. Having a seven-game series against Sacramento,
being down, 3-2, it challenged us. We responded to it. It makes this
one that much more special."</TE>
<TE>   In a late huddle, when the lead was nine and the clock was under
four minutes, Fisher looked straight into Fox's eyes and from three
feet away screamed, "Three-peat!" And Fox nodded.</TE>
<TE>   They flexed and relaxed their fists, and they swayed to the theme
from "Rocky," meant to inspire the Nets, from three games and nine
points back.</TE>
<TE>   It would not happen.</TE>
<TE>   Before the opening tip, O'Neal looked into the crowd and found his
stepfather, Phil Harrison. They made eye contact, O'Neal pointed and
Harrison nodded.</TE>
<TE>   Periodically, O'Neal would peer at Harrison, the man they call
"Sarge," and he'd touch his chest with his right fist.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank God for both of the Phils in my life," O'Neal said. "Phil
Jackson, who always stayed on me. And Phil Harrison, who always
stayed on me. I'm just so happy right now. Going to enjoy the moment
and take most of the summer off and then make a decision at the end
of the summer on what I'm going to do [about his toe]."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers left with their arms around each other, to a bus that
would take them into the night, into their celebrations. Toward ...
four?</TE>
<TE>   "They're plotting, they're waiting. I'm sure Sacramento's working
out right now," Bryant said. "We're not going to let our guards down.
We're going to come back next year ready to play. They're going to
try to take what we have and we're going to be waiting for them."</TE>

<HD>Third Three-Peat Ties Jackson With Auerbach</HD>
<DH>Lakers: Coach lights up his own cigar after ninth title
catches Celtic legend. His playoff wins surpass Riley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Somewhere in Boston on Wednesday night, Red Auerbach was probably
sitting with an unlit cigar.</LD>
<LD>   Auerbach had reigned supreme as the coach with the most
championships in NBA history, a total of nine. Wednesday, he got
company. Phil Jackson joined him when his Lakers swept the New Jersey
Nets in the NBA Finals.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson's nine might be even more impressive because they have
come in bunches of three, a three-peat with the Chicago Bulls that
ended with the 1992-93 season, another Bull three-peat that ended in
the 1997-98 season and now this.</LD>
<TE>   Most coaches would be gracious in welcoming another into their
elite circle. Auerbach has been bitter, pointing out the superstars
Jackson had at his disposal in Chicago and with the Lakers, from
Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen to Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe
Bryant. Auerbach has, of course, ignored his own stable of superstars
from Bill Russell and Bill Sharman to Bob Cousy and John Havlicek.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson has taken the high road in this drama, saying Auerbach has
claimed he was misquoted and announced he was sure Auerbach would
send him a victory cigar like the ones he himself smoked.</TE>
<TE>   "Looks like I'm going to have to get my own cigar out of my
briefcase in the locker room and light it up," Jackson said after
Wednesday's victory. "I didn't get one [from] Red."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson reached several other milestones Wednesday. The victory
was his 156th in the postseason, surpassing Pat Riley as the
winningest playoff coach in history. The sweep was Jackson's first in
the NBA Finals. And he becomes the first coach to lead two different
teams to a three-peat.</TE>
<TE>   And with all that going on, Jackson had the presence of mind to
put 14-year veteran Mitch Richmond into the game in the closing
minutes. .</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's strength as a coach has always come from his ability to
motivate his players, whether by presenting them with selected books
to expand their minds, or selected plays to expand their game.</TE>
<TE>   It helps, of course, that he was a player, at the University of
North Dakota, for a decade with the New York Knicks and for a final
two seasons with the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   When Jackson arrived in Los Angeles three years ago, he had a
center who, despite possessing the size and skill to be a dominating
force in the league, had never won a championship at the collegiate
or pro level. One of the first things Jackson did upon assuming the
reins of the Lakers was to invite the Laker center up to his Montana
hideaway to discuss his future plans. In the wilds of Montana, the
seeds of a dynasty were planted. .</TE>
<TE>   But those seeds needed to be grown and nurtured.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing about basketball is that the drama changes every
night," Jackson said. "There's a different scenario that happens. We
hope they could run like a play on Broadway, but they don't. There's
different lines for everybody to use.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my belief and my experience that the third victory in the
three successive years is always the most unique and most difficult
one to fight your way through. This certainly was so this year."</TE>
<TE>   But Jackson, for all his accomplishments, is quick to hand off the
credit.</TE>
<TE>   "They knew," he said of his players, "that games aren't won in the
first quarter, seasons aren't won in the first month. They pace
themselves very well."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson praised all the players who had contributed to his win
total, and his assistant coaches, singling out Tex Winter, architect
of the triangle offense.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson reserved special praise for one of his former coaches, who
is no longer alive.</TE>
<TE>   "I said at the start of this year that I was [dedicating] this
championship to Red Holzman, my mentor," Jackson said. "This is a big
moment for me and for him."</TE>
<TE>   But not necessarily the last. Jackson says he'll be back next year
to shoot for a 10th title.</TE>
<TE>   That news undoubtedly won't go over well in Boston.</TE>

<AU>RICK MAJERUS</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Let's congratulate this Laker team and then break it down into its
elements. I'm a coach. It is what a coach does, break things down.</LD>
<LD>   Shaquille O'Neal, simply stated, is a warrior. He played this
season through pain, through triple teams, through every defense any
coach with a yellow legal pad could concoct. He played through
occasionally being forsaken by his teammates, who had to come to the
realization that they had to work well and play well together or this
championship could have ended up residing in Cow Town.</LD>
<LD>   Shaq brought it every night. He played through the double and
triple teams with poise and unselfishness. He rebounded out of area
and in traffic and now, almost best of all, he has become a
Be-Like-Mike at the free-throw line as well.</LD>
<TE>   Although he may never get credit for it in the public eye, the
giant who is Shaq is now without peer, either past or present, in the
game as we know it.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Kobe Bryant. As a coach, I want to tip my hat to him
because, he does what we all want all our players to do: HE GUARDS!
He not only plays excellent defense but takes pride in it. And
irrespective of the occasional bad shot, this guy could very well be
the best on-ball defender in the game today.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the supporting cast: Robert Horry, Derek Fisher and
Rick Fox. They are what role players are supposed to be. They all
defend, on and off the ball. They all compete for rebounds. And they
all do a great job of opportunistically letting the game come to
them.</TE>
<TE>   I would be remiss if I didn't recognize the founder of the feast.
Jerry West is the best in his profession. Somewhere today, in the
Land of Blue Suede Shoes, the King is going to come back. Only this
king has arrived on a plane from the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   If they made this team into a movie, the main credits would go to
West, Phil Jackson, and a cast of dedicated assistant coaches. Won't
somebody out there take a chance on Frankie Hamblen, a lifer on the
bench, who could resurrect a moribund program? (Are you listening in
Denver, Kiki Vandeweghe?)</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Mitch Kupchak. Although not the household name of
his predecessor, Laker Land is lucky to have such an astute, shrewd
associate producer.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, I'm going to buy a book about the Zen Master, because I,
too, want to call fewer timeouts and not have to use as much stick
deodorant come game time. Jackson is unflappable. I admire his poise
and composure, as well as the relationship he has with his players.
You can sense the trust and confidence, and you can sense it goes
both ways.</TE>
<TE>   As for New Jersey, it entered the domain of the NBA West and was
unceremoniously exposed for what the East was this season. Weak.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets should celebrate their good season, not downplay their
regular-season accomplishments. Then they should look themselves in
the mirror, vow not to get a second black eye next season and pledge
among themselves to play tougher, go deeper and be more poised. They
need to pledge their off-season, just as the Magics and Birds and
Jordans of the NBA world did, to become more skilled.</TE>
<TE>   It has been an honor and a privilege to have been asked to do
this. I've had a lot of fun, but I'm going to keep my day job,
despite what some of the Runnin' Ute booster groups might be hoping.</TE>
<TE>   I will not lose the appreciation I acquired for how hard it is to
do this on a daily basis and how good most of these guys are on tough
deadlines. There are exceptions, but those write for Page 2.</TE>
<TE>   So it is over. Happy three-peat.</TE>
<TE>   And just to show how Hollywood-ized I've become, here's my final
word.</TE>
<TE>   Ciao.</TE>

<HD>Scott Wants to Avoid Finals Fade</HD>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The Indiana Pacers took the Lakers to six games in the NBA Finals in
2000 but are no longer considered an elite team. The Philadelphia
76ers extended the Lakers to five games in the 2001 Finals, but they
also faded from contention.</LD>
<LD>   The New Jersey Nets don't want to follow in the footsteps of two
other Eastern Conference teams after they were vanquished by the
Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, we're going to try to get a little bit better," Coach
Byron Scott said before the Nets faced elimination in Game 4 on
Wednesday. "Every team looks to improve. Myself and [General Manager]
Rod Thorn will take a look at what we have after the season. We want
to upgrade.</LD>
<TE>   "We're not far away from getting back here again next year."</TE>
<TE>   The first order of business could be re-signing point guard Jason
Kidd, the runner-up to San Antonio's Tim Duncan in
most-valuable-player voting this season, to a long-term contract. The
Nets acquired Kidd in an off-season deal that sent point guard
Stephon Marbury to the Phoenix Suns, won a franchise-best 52 games
and advanced to their first Finals.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the Nets' progress must come from the players already on
the roster, according to Scott.</TE>
<TE>   "We lost to Boston in my rookie year," said Scott, a former Laker
guard. "All it did was motivate me to work harder in the off-season.
I knew if I got better, the other guys on team would get better and
we would get back to the Finals. It's the same with this team.
Everybody on this team understands he has to get that much better."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scott awoke from his afternoon nap Wednesday, wondering if this
would be the last time this season that he would catch a few winks on
his couch before a game. He refused to divulge his other game-day
habits, following a time-honored tradition of refusing to comment on
superstitions.</TE>
<TE>   "Earvin used to change his phone number before the playoffs,"
Scott said, referring to former Laker teammate Magic Johnson. "My
thing was all the business matters, all the family matters were
tossed aside during the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There has been a good deal of talk in the days leading up to Game
4 about what the Nets learned from their first Finals appearance.
Perhaps a little too much talk, according to New Jersey forward
Kenyon Martin. He wasn't interested in new life experiences. He
wanted to win the championship.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no guarantee that you'll get back here, so you've got to
try to seize the moment," he said.</TE>

<HD>Martin Takes More Shots</HD>
<DH>NBA Finals: New Jersey's volatile forward critical of his
teammates for their lackluster play in L.A.'s series sweep.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Loose Kenyon, indeed.</LD>
<LD>   Near the end of an unusually taut night at the NBA Finals, it was
difficult to determine whether it was power forward Kenyon Martin's
volcanic temper or his many electric moves that was more impressive
Wednesday in Game 4.</LD>
<LD>   Or frightening.</LD>
<TE>   Martin would score 35 points, a playoff career high, and take 11
rebounds in the New Jersey Nets' 113-107 loss, outstanding work
against the three-time NBA champion Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   But he also drew an unnecessary technical foul in the first
quarter, wheeled as if to take a swing at Laker center Shaquille
O'Neal after a scramble for a loose ball in the fourth quarter and
then called out his teammates for their lackluster play after they
were swept from the Finals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a game to some people," said Martin, who averaged 21.8
points in his first Finals. "I live and die for this game. Some
people just approach it as, 'Oh, well.' That's their attitude. Some
guys on this team, they play hard. They play with all their heart. I
feel I'm one of them. I tried to talk about it all season, tried to
motivate people. I did that to the point where I was tired of
talking.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the stat sheet and it's difficult to deal with. It's the
most important game of our lives and some people didn't bring it."</TE>
<TE>   Martin didn't name names. But it didn't take a wizard to guess
that he was taking a shot at small forward Keith Van Horn, who
completed an indifferent series by scoring seven points in 31
minutes, and center Todd MacCulloch, who had eight points in 20
minutes and rarely laid a finger on O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kidd, who had 13 points, 12 assists and five rebounds in 43
minutes, and presumably was not among those Martin targeted for his
disgust, winced when Martin's comments were relayed to him during the
postgame press conference.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to get into that," Kidd said. "K-Mart, he can
handle all the controversy. I do agree to an extent that it was do or
die since Game 1. So, if you don't show any kind of heart or any
emotion at this point, then maybe you shouldn't be playing. But if
he's named names, I'm going to let him stand alone. I'm going to back
him up, but I'm not the [spokesman] on that one. I'm not going to
touch that."</TE>
<TE>   Martin just completed his second NBA season after four remarkable
years at Cincinnati. Better days are no doubt ahead for him. He has
the gift of a lightning-quick first step toward the basket. He has a
sound jump shot from 20 feet. He can be ferocious on the backboards
when he wants to be.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the last two games, he's showed the type of player he can
be," New Jersey Coach Byron Scott said, referring to Martin's
26-point performance in Game 3 and his play in Game 4. "Hopefully, he
continues to grow, continues to get better.... I said the Lakers had
two superstars and we had one and a half. I think Kenyon is still
developing. He has the potential to be an all-star, there's no doubt
about that."</TE>
<TE>   Well, perhaps if he can control his anger he'll have the potential
to be an all-star. Twice this past season he was suspended for rough
play, sitting out a total of seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Wednesday wasn't the right time to criticize his
teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, maybe it was.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about not backing down against O'Neal, Martin began to rant
about his teammates' lack of character.</TE>
<TE>   "Some guys don't have it in them," he said. "That's the hardest
thing to deal with. Guys come to play every day, but some guys, you
don't know when they're going to show up. I can deal with losing, but
guys who don't bring it every day, that's something I can't deal
with."</TE>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>A championship era turned three Wednesday, the party awash in
champagne and relief, the thick-throated singing heard from here to
Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   There were streamers; swooping Kobe Bryant, dangling Robert Horry.</LD>
<LD>   There were candles; Derek Fisher flickering, Devean George
burning.</LD>
<TE>   There were party bags filled with most surprising oddities,
including an emotional Jerry Buss and a sweating Mitch Richmond.</TE>
<TE>   And there was, of course, the mandatory visit from a giant,
Shaquille O'Neal, who carried the entire Laker party to a 113-107
victory over the New Jersey Nets and a four-game sweep of the NBA
Finals.</TE>
<TE>   After which, he hugged his tiny, sobbing grandfather.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been so happy in my life to see a boy grow up to be a
man," said Donald Harrison.</TE>
<TE>   Thus also describes this team, which won its third consecutive NBA
championship by navigating upstream with a heavy, exhausting stroke
that can best described as three-style.</TE>
<TE>   From the flops to the feuds to the fourth quarter two seasons ago
against Portland ... to history.</TE>
<TE>   They are the first Los Angeles Laker team to win three titles in a
row, the first Laker team to sweep a finals series, and the first
Laker team to celebrate by singing ... a children's song?</TE>
<TE>   In their sour-smelling locker room afterward, the champagne
puddling in their eyes and on the floor, they draped their giant arms
around each other and pulled themselves into a small circle and
chanted.</TE>
<TE>   "Red light ... green light ... red light ... green light.''</TE>
<TE>   Explained Fisher: "That's the name of a children's game that we've
talked about all year. We've used it to remind ourselves that it's
like this team has been together since we were children. We've been
through a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Then, as if they didn't believe it themselves, they chanted
another chant.</TE>
<TE>   "One, two three ... one, two, three ... one, two, three."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody said four, but, face it, that's what everybody was
thinking. The party didn't feel like an ending, but a beginning. The
players didn't talk about summer vacation, but summer toil.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure Sacramento's working out right now," said Bryant,
touching the gold championship ball with one hand while clenching his
fist with the other. "They're going to try to take what we have.
We're going to be waiting for them."</TE>
<TE>   Like any good birthday song, the Lakers finished it with one
thought.</TE>
<TE>   ... And many more ...</TE>
<TE>   "At least two more," said Rick Fox in the middle of the locker
room, adding, "Will somebody get me a bottle!"</TE>
<TE>   While the first championship was more emotional, and the second
championship was more overpowering, this third party came with the
best guest list.</TE>
<TE>   Thoughts of Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar were there.</TE>
<TE>   By winning three consecutive titles, O'Neal has now done something
that the greatest Laker centers have not.</TE>
<TE>   The spirit of Pat Riley was also there.</TE>
<TE>   With his 156th career playoff win, Phil Jackson surpasses Riley
for the career postseason coaching record.</TE>
<TE>   Looming in the background at Continental Airlines Arena, floating
like a wisp of cigar smoke, was also Red Auerbach and the Boston
Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   Next season, Jackson can surpass Auerbach with his 10th NBA
championship. Next season, the Lakers can become only the second team
besides the legendary Celtics to win four titles in a row.</TE>
<TE>   But enough about next season. Wednesday was about a moment unto
itself, a feeling that carried the Lakers to another fourth-quarter
spin, the final spin, that left the Nets dizzy and lost.</TE>
<TE>   One moment early in the fourth quarter, the Nets led by three
points. Then Bryant calmly hit a three-pointer. Then Brian Shaw
shrugged and threw in a jump shot. Then George smilingly hit another
three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   While O'Neal carried the load throughout the last week, being
named Finals most valuable player for a third consecutive time, in
the end it was about the team.</TE>
<TE>   The dirty little secret about these starry-skied Lakers is that
they've always been about the team.</TE>
<TE>   When the Nets pulled back to within one point in the final seven
minutes? Horry stole the ball, Fisher hit a jumper, Bryant drew a
charge ... you want to know anything else about this team?</TE>
<TE>   Oh yeah, with 1:17 remaining, the Lakers showed something else,
something extraordinary.</TE>
<TE>   During a timeout, Jackson summoned Richmond. Fisher stepped behind
him and gently shoved him into the game.</TE>
<TE>   After fourteen seasons without a title, after an entire playoffs
with only one appearance and none in these Finals, Richmond was going
to finish the championship on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher had bet Richmond before the game that he would play. O'Neal
had urged the team to get the lead so Richmond could play.</TE>
<TE>   Said Richmond: "I will cherish that forever."</TE>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Fifteen or 20 years from now some phenom will stride into the NBA
Finals' championship news conference wearing a Laker jersey with a
big "8" on his back, paying homage to superstar Kobe Bryant, and we
will understand.</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday night it was a young Bryant, hanging a Michael Jordan
jersey and a Jordan rookie warm-up shirt in his Continental Airlines
Arena locker for inspiration, because "he's the greatest of them
all," he said, and when it's all said and done, I wonder.</LD>
<LD>   The championship trophy in his arms, Kobe walked down a long
hallway to the interview room after the Lakers had swept the Nets,
saying he loved the smell of championship champagne, and so he said,
he'd keep his Jordan prizes dry.</LD>
<TE>   "Unbelievable feeling to have three right now," he said. "I can't
tell the future, so I don't know how many more of these there will
be, but I've already said something to the guys about getting ready
for next year."</TE>
<TE>   For some time he has sounded like Jordan, and now come the
results, and at such a young age.</TE>
<TE>   Now no one provided more stirring championship moments in recent
years than Jordan, of course, and while Shaquille O'Neal is
unquestionably the giant that cannot be stopped, Bryant is 23 going
on three championships with a hunger for more.</TE>
<TE>   "Shoot, by the time he's finished," Magic Johnson said, "he could
have nine or 10 championships. That's very realistic."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A YEAR ago Kobe sat in the Laker locker room after the clinching
victory over Philadelphia and almost sobbed, his shoulders heaving as
he fought to catch his breath, the pressure that most 22-year-olds
never feel finally finding a release.</TE>
<TE>   There was the feud with Shaq, the private Kobe dealing with family
problems, the critics demanding maturity overnight, and it all taking
place in an unforgiving public forum.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just sitting there in the locker room tired and stressed
out," he acknowledged. "So much happened last year ... just so much.</TE>
<TE>   "But this is different," he said, the Kobe grin adding an
exclamation point. "This whole season has been great. It's the
happiest season I have ever had--from start to finish."</TE>
<TE>   After this championship run he slapped the hands of fans and media
alike, posing for everyone with an Instamatic, and looking nothing
like a man who had ripped the hearts out of the Nets and their fans
with another fourth-quarter patented-Kobe blitz.</TE>
<TE>   A miserable three of 10 after three quarters, those in L.A. who
are blessed to watch the young man grow year-by-year know it doesn't
matter how badly things have gone because with this competitor's
Jordan-like killer instinct, the next shot is going to win the game.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe made four of six in the fourth quarter, including a
three-point dagger the Nets couldn't possibly have expected him to
make. (One more dig for the kid, who I've claimed couldn't outshoot
my daughter from three-point range.)</TE>
<TE>   And after all the teasing for his erratic three-point shooting, he
finished two of three in Game 4--a remarkable 22 of 58 from long
range in the playoffs, and as I understand now, throw a challenge his
way and he will respond.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you see those threes?" he yelled at me. "And when they
counted."</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot to be said for luck," I shot back, and he roared
with approving laughter. It was nice to hear.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CLIPPER ELTON Brand said he had plans to sneak out of Game 4 at
halftime, making it clear he felt uncomfortable being at a NBA
playoff game as a spectator after receiving an award from the Pro
Basketball Writers.</TE>
<TE>   Brand has been in the NBA three years and has yet to appear in a
playoff game. I told him, "Don't feel badly--it could be worse, you
could be playing for the Dodgers."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have won 95 playoff games since the Dodgers last won a
postseason game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GAMBLER PHIL Mickelson was quoted in a New York newspaper
Wednesday morning predicting the Nets would win the final two games
in East Rutherford "and open L.A.'s eyes." I was concerned initially
when I read it, because if he was suggesting the Lakers might choke,
he does have some expertise in this area.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I RECEIVED the following e-mail from Brandon Dunne:</TE>
<TE>   "I think Bill Walton is quite possibly the dumbest idiot in all of
sports, constantly contradicting himself, making outrageous
overstatements that are so obscure his colleagues mock him at times.
But I'd like to hear from someone like yourself."</TE>
<TE>   I think Bill Walton is the MVP of these Finals, and the NBA
playoffs as a whole, beginning with the "The Love it Live Tour," and
rising above a boring series to make the prime-time NBA show
entertaining.</TE>
<TE>   "Once again too much coffee for Bill," said NBC's Marv Albert
after another Walton outburst, and I hope he never switches to
decaffeinated.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HOW MANY teams in the NBA could get away with signing Isaiah Rider
and Mitch Richmond back-to-back, get so little out of them and win it
all? You could probably add Scottie Pippen to this team now and win
it again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PAMELA ANDERSON has agreed to become a columnist for "Jane"
magazine. And we get stuck with Rick Majerus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WNBA PLAYERS say they are ready to strike. To each one of them, I
say, "You go, girl."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Mike Pfirrman:</TE>
<TE>   "Your article on Donald Stern confirmed one thing: You are
definitely the biggest idiot I have ever read in the Times."</TE>
<TE>   His name is David. David Stern.</TE>

<LD>Laker owner Jerry Buss was emotional after his eighth championship.</LD>
<LD>   "I am very, very proud," he said. "When you win an amount of
championships back in the '80s, you wonder if that's ever, every
going to repeat in your life. To build another championship team like
this, I'm so proud of these guys I can't even tell you."</LD>
<LD>   Buss was not thrilled that the Lakers were forced to celebrate in
the middle of a visiting court amid boos and catcalls.</LD>
<TE>   "The fans in L.A., I wish every one of them could be here at this
moment," he said. "It's just a shame we couldn't win it on our own
home court. But I know everybody's watching. We love you, the team
loves you, and keep supporting us."</TE>
<TE>   Derek Fisher looked on the bright side of the boos.</TE>
<TE>   "At least they didn't hit us upside the head with bottles while we
were getting our trophy,'' he said.</TE>

<TE>   No Wins, but Nets Had Some Laughs</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey assistant coach Eddie Jordan reached far back into his
closet for a little comic relief, wearing his Net jersey from the
late 1970s to the pregame shoot-around.</TE>
<TE>   The white jersey, which looked about two sizes too small, gave the
Nets a good laugh during tense times.</TE>
<TE>   "He's put on a few pounds since his playing days, but I thought it
was cool," Net Coach Byron Scott said. "He lightened the guys up
again. We were in watching tape and guys were pretty serious. He came
out and made a fool of himself, but he gave the guys something to
smile about and laugh about to get their mind off of basketball for a
brief moment. I think it was good for them."</TE>
<TE>   If Jordan had given Scott any notice, he said he might have worn
one of his old Laker jerseys to join in the fun. But he's certain
neither coach would have dared sport his old shorts.</TE>
<TE>   "He was smart enough not to bring the trunks; guys would have been
on the floor laughing," he said. "I had my son put mine on and I'm
much bigger than him and he said, 'Dad, how did you fit in these
things?' I'm not even going to try that."</TE>

<TE>   New Yorkers Don't Have Tunnel Vision</TE>
<TE>   If it had been the New York Knicks instead of the Nets facing the
Lakers in the Finals, it would have been headline news in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, two New York tabloids, the Daily News and the Post, went
with baseball on their banner page Wednesday. In the Daily News, the
Laker-Net series was on Page 6, getting little more coverage than a
regular-season game would.</TE>
<TE>   Even this weekend's Yankee-Met series is bigger news and it's
still a few days away.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   They Were Good Back in the Day</TE>
<TE>   Much has been made of the Lakers' dynamic scoring duo, Shaquille
O'Neal and Bryant. O'Neal averaged 36.3 points per game in the
Finals, Bryant 26.8. But those numbers don't look so gaudy compared
to the record-holders. Elgin Baylor averaged 40.6 points per game,
Jerry West 31.1 in the 1962 NBA Finals, highest figures for teammates
in Finals history. Baylor and West compiled those averages over seven
games in a series won by the Boston Celtics.</TE>

<TE>   This Clipper Had His Own Magic Moment</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday was a big day for the Clippers. L.A.'s other basketball
team, the guys who didn't make the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Elton Brand, the Clippers' power forward, won the Magic Johnson
Award, presented by the Professional Basketball Writers Assn. for
basketball excellence and media and public professionalism.</TE>
<TE>   Brand, a first-time All-Star this season, also was named to play
on the U.S. team that will compete in the World Championships, Aug.
29-Sept. 8 in Indianapolis. He and Detroit's Ben Wallace were given
the final two slots, with Nick Collison, who will be a senior at
Kansas, was selected as an alternate.</TE>

<HD>NBC Goodbye Was Short and Sweet</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC said goodbye. And it was done with class and, perhaps more
importantly, with succinctness.</LD>
<LD>   "One last time, you're watching the NBA on NBC," said Bob Costas,
introducing a video of highlights from the network's 12-year run.</LD>
<LD>   Marv Albert, who was celebrating his 61st birthday, said what a
privilege it had been, Bill Walton thanked Albert for his patience
before shedding what appeared to be a real tear, and Steve "Snapper"
Jones, searching for the right word, called Walton "a real
character."</LD>
<TE>   To NBC's credit, it didn't seem to lose sight of the fact the
night belonged to the Lakers, not NBC.</TE>
<TE>   What seemed strange, though, was that NBC seemed to have crowned
the Lakers before the game even started. During the pregame show,
Costas said it was only a matter of time.</TE>
<TE>   "The Lakers are 48 minutes from a convincing three-peat," he said.
"It's not a question of whether the Lakers will celebrate this year's
championship but rather how many titles they can run off to determine
their ultimate place in NBA history."</TE>
<TE>   And it was at halftime that Commissioner David Stern, during a
live interview with Costas, took the opportunity to thank NBC.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to take my last five seconds to thank my great friends at
NBC for 12 spectacular years," Stern said.</TE>
<TE>   Did he know this would be NBC's final game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After NBC signed off and Channel 4 went to Fred Roggin in New
Jersey, Roggin found himself being a public servant.</TE>
<TE>   First he told Kobe Bryant that police at Staples Center were
firing rubber bullets at fans and asked him to deliver a message to
those who might be watching the jumbo screen outside the arena.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant told them to settle down and act like champions.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Shaquille O'Neal said he didn't want any fans or any of his
police officer friends to get hurt. Then, maybe a little wrapped up
in the moment, he blurted out, "I know the fans are happy as ... ,
and I'm happy as ... ."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Walton was really wired Wednesday night, maybe more than usual.</TE>
<TE>   "I think once again it's a case of too much coffee for Bill,"
Albert marveled at one point early on.</TE>
<TE>   But then what was Tom Tolbert on? He appeared desperate to go out
with a bang and ended up misfiring.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of the Lakers, he said, "It's not a question of if, but
when they will win a championship. What is their place in the
pantheon of all great teams? I don't know, I just wanted to say
pantheon."</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't so bad, but then, commenting on the fact that Kobe was
wearing a Michael Jordan jersey before the game, he said:</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he might pay tribute to one of the greatest high
jumpers of our era and wear a Mickey Mouse T-shirt, Dwight Stones."</TE>
<TE>   Responded a bewildered Costas: "You lost me."</TE>
<TE>   Tolbert: "I lost myself too. I do that a lot."</TE>
<TE>   What Tolbert needed to explain was that Dwight Stones used to wear
Mickey Mouse T-shirts. Not many viewers would have known that. Of
course, not many would have know who Stones is either.</TE>
<TE>   It was an obscure reference not many would get. The whole bit was
weird.</TE>
<TE>   And then at halftime Tolbert chipped in with:</TE>
<TE>   "Jason Kidd needs to play every minute of the second half. Byron
Scott should forget about rotation, or the next thing he'll have to
worry about is rotating the tires on his car."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Tolbert has been hanging out with Walton too much. When
Albert said that Stern has suggested that perhaps teams playing Shaq
and the Lakers should be allowed to play a sixth man, Walton said, "I
think he said that in jest." Retorted Albert: "You think so?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Albert, an easygoing sort, handles Walton well, but Jones might be
getting fed up.</TE>
<TE>   He was snapping at Walton pretty good.</TE>
<TE>   After Walton heaped praise on O'Neal for passing to Devean George
for a wide-open three-point shot, Jones said, "You can't hit a wide
open man? I don't know what you're talking about."</TE>
<TE>   Viewers at home no doubt agreed with that one.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jim Gray must have thought he was Roy Firestone when he decided to
conduct a lengthy in-depth interview with Julius Erving while action
was taking place in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   But Gray rallied with his postgame interviews.</TE>
<TE>   After Game 3, Shaq had chided Gray about his interview with Mike
Tyson on the pay-per-view telecast of Tyson's loss to Lennox Lewis
Saturday night. "I wish Mike Tyson had knocked you out," Shaq said.</TE>
<TE>   But after Game 4, Shaq's final comment to Gray was, "Love you."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To set the record straight, Costas called earlier Wednesday and
said he had no idea he cut off Ahmad Rashad in mid-sentence during
the Game 3 pregame show Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   He said his producer was talking to him in his ear telling him to
go to a commercial break and he wasn't aware Rashad was still
talking.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever, it still wasn't any kind of a sendoff for Rashad, who
had just done his final feature for NBC after a 20-year stint.</TE>
<TE>   Rashad was back on NBC Wednesday night, but only to help with the
trophy presentations. His last official act for NBC came Sunday
night, and whether you like Rashad or not, it was no way to treat a
loyal employee.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes you wonder who is pushing the buttons at Channel 4.
During Roggin's pregame show Wednesday night, Channel 4 joined the
national anthem after it began.</TE>
<TE>   Then the station abruptly cut away for a commercial before it was
over.</TE>
<TE>   At least during the Finals Channel 4 wasn't showing that
bothersome scroll at the bottom of the screen promoting Roggin's
postgame show during live action as it had during the Western
Conference finals.</TE>
