<LD>Nissan North America is auctioning the first production model of the
new 350Z, vehicle identification number 000001, on Ebaymotors.com to
raise funds for the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (and,
we mightily suspect, to garner publicity like this for the new Z).</LD>
<LD>   The Gardena-based car company put a base value of $37,000 on the
inaugural Z when the auction opened last week, and by mid-day
Tuesday, bidding had soared to $62,100.</LD>
<LD>   The auction closes Thursday, and Highway 1 will let you know next
week how much someone was willing to pay for Z No. 1.</LD>
<TE>   Hybrid Cars</TE>
<TE>   Last week's comparison of the Toyota Prius and Honda Civic hybrids
omitted a key measurement for the Prius' electric motor. Its
torque--the power to turn the drive shaft and move the vehicle's
mass, critical for acceleration, climbing hills or towing--is 258
foot pounds.</TE>
<TE>   As reported, the Toyota's gasoline engine produces 82 foot pounds
of torque.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Honda, Toyota does not provide a figure for overall torque
when the two motors are working in tandem.</TE>
<TE>   The Civic Hybrid vehicle offers combined torque of 116 foot
pounds.</TE>

<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cadillac has taken the wraps off another of its upcoming models: the
SRX sport wagon.</LD>
<LD>   The seven-seat wagon, due in dealerships next summer as an '04
model, will feature rear-wheel drive, a base V-6 engine with a
Northstar V-8 option and optional all-wheel drive.</LD>
<LD>   Cadillac has not priced the SRX, but hints that it should start
somewhere south of $40,000.</LD>
<TE>   Lincoln '03 Aviator</TE>
<TE>   South of $40,000--by $5--also is the starting price for Lincoln's
new Aviator mid-size sport utility vehicle, the company said this
week. The $39,995 manufacturer's suggested retail price includes
Lincoln's $740 destination charge.</TE>
<TE>   The Aviator, due in dealerships in October as an '03 model, is
based on the Ford Explorer platform but has all-new body work. It
will come standard with a 4.6-liter V-8 engine, five-speed automatic
transmission, fold-flat third-row seating and 17-inch wheels and
tires.</TE>
<TE>   There are four trim and equipment levels, starting with the
rear-wheel-drive "luxury trim" base model and ratcheting up to the
all-wheel-drive "premium trim" top-of-the-line model with a suggested
retail price of $45,865.</TE>

<HD>Sometimes, Differences Are Only Skin Deep</HD>
<DH>Even seemingly disparate brands can share a common platform</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF YIP</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Volkswagen's cute New Beetle and Audi's edgy TT two-seat sport coupe
don't seem to have much in common. And Buick's white-bread Regal
would never get a second look from fans of Chevrolet's
NASCAR-flavored Monte Carlo SS.</LD>
<LD>   But each pair are automotive "twins," joined not just by a
marketing slogan or corporate heritage but by the automotive DNA of
engineering and shared parts. Twins are not uncommon.</LD>
<LD>   When Daryl Nishioka's beloved Acura Legend was stolen, the
Huntington Beach man seriously thought of replacing it with a Honda
Accord EX, twin to the more expensive 2002 Acura TL. He is such a fan
of Honda's cars that his friends joke that Nishioka's red blood cells
are H-shaped like the car maker's logo.</LD>
<TE>   But he ended up going with the Acura for $30,500, or about $8,000
more than the Accord. "You get the snob appeal of an Acura, and it's
a little quieter than the Accord and handles better," he said. "I got
more car."</TE>
<TE>   Those two cars were spun, though, from the same basic engineering.
Known as platform sharing, it is a common tactic today as auto makers
strive to keep a lid on development and production costs.</TE>
<TE>   Savvy consumers can benefit by knowing which vehicles are
twins--and which parts are shared. A buyer who wants but cannot
afford the luxurious Audi A6 can get most of the same engineering and
power train in its Volkswagen Passat V-6 twin.</TE>
<TE>   The practice is straight out of a 70-year-old General Motors Corp.
play book, said John Wolkonowicz of the Bulin Group, a Northville,
Mich., consulting company that helps auto makers zero in on what
consumers will want.</TE>
<TE>   "General Motors in the '30s invented the whole concept," and
others copied, he said.</TE>
<TE>   For many of the Route 66 generation, going from a Chevrolet to a
Pontiac--or Oldsmobile or Buick--was a rite of passage culminating in
the ultimate symbol of success: a cushy Cadillac.</TE>
<TE>   GM's four-wheeled steppingstones were often built on common
platforms because, after all, "the future of the corporation and its
earning power, we asserted, depended upon its ability to design and
produce cars of maximum utility ... at minimum cost," former GM Chief
Executive Alfred P. Sloan wrote in his autobiography. Sloan, one of
the architects of platform sharing, died in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   One result of his innovative thinking is the proliferation of
makes and models available to consumers today, said Jim Hossack, a
consultant with Tustin-based AutoPacific Inc., a global automotive
market research firm.</TE>
<TE>   Development costs used to dictate that no car could be successful
in the U.S. market unless the auto maker could sell hundreds of
thousands without having to make more than minimal changes from model
year to model year.</TE>
<TE>   Today, car makers routinely produce limited-run niche models from
shared platform programs--Ford's resurrected Thunderbird roadster,
for example, from the platform developed for the Lincoln LS and
Jaguar S-Type sedans--and count them successful, and profitable, if
just 25,000 to 50,000 are sold.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese, especially, took careful notes.</TE>
<TE>   Their astounding success in the auto market is built largely on
the economies of using twins to spread development, engineering and
manufacturing and parts costs across the broadest spectrum possible.</TE>
<TE>   It all starts with the platform, which used to be a physical
thing--the steel underbody of a car or truck--but more and more is
defined as a set of engineering specifications that determine the
optimum locations for a vehicle's basic pieces to ensure the best
handling, ride, balance, safety and ease of production.</TE>
<TE>   "The auto industry isn't in agreement about how to define a
platform anymore," said Mike Michels, spokesman for Torrance-based
Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc., a company that has based a large and
growing lineup of cars and trucks on relatively few platforms.</TE>
<TE>   "We talk about platforms at Toyota in terms of the percentage of
shared components. So it is not literally the steel underbody
stamping but the aggregate of common parts that different vehicles
might share."</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler spokesman Jan Zverina said his company's engineers and
designers stick to the original idea. "The platform can be considered
to be the underbody structure of a vehicle," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Platforms now are modular; they can be stretched or shortened,
widened or narrowed to fit different designs. The advent of the
so-called crossover or car-based sport utility vehicle, such as the
Lexus RX300 from Toyota's luxury division, means that completely
different kinds of vehicles can share a platform.</TE>
<TE>   At Nissan, for example, the new 350Z sports car rides on a
platform shared with the Infiniti G35 sedan and the forthcoming G35
coupe, M45 sedan and FX45 sport wagon.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota's Camry also provides the underpinnings of the Lexus RX300
SUV and ES300 sedan and the Toyota Sienna minivan, Avalon sedan and
Highlander SUV.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to have fewer platforms. It takes hundreds of millions
to develop a car line," said Gordon Wangers, president of AMCI, a
Vista, Calif.-based auto product planning group.</TE>
<TE>   If an auto maker can spread that amount among four different
vehicles, the savings can be tremendous. It hasn't made cars cheaper
than they were a few decades ago, but it has helped keep costs from
escalating more, said AutoPacific's Hossack.</TE>
<TE>   Platforms can be shared even by seeming competitors.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota's Corolla-based Matrix, a sporty wagon, is a twin of the
Pontiac Vibe, which shares everything except its exterior sheet metal
with the Matrix and is built in a Northern California auto plant, New
United Motor Manufacturing Inc., jointly owned by Toyota and GM. And
Volvo's 40-series cars and station wagons and Chrysler's Sebring
coupe all share platforms with the sporty Mitsubishi Eclipse, thanks
to a series of development deals.</TE>
<TE>   The number of shared components can vary wildly. In fact, though
"twins" is the commonly used term to describe shared-platform
vehicles, some are best described as "cousins."</TE>
<TE>   Honda's perennial best-selling family sedan, for example, provides
the basic DNA of a hot-selling entry-level car from its Acura luxury
division. Twins, yes, but they share relatively little.</TE>
<TE>   Acura takes the Honda Accord's basic underpinnings, replaces a
vast array of pieces, including engine, transmission, body panels,
suspension, dashboard trim and mirrors, adds high-intensity discharge
headlights, a sporty shifter, a premium sound system and heated
mirrors and seats and out pops the Acura 3.2 TL.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing what is shared--and what isn't--can help consumers make
smart decisions. Just as a bargain-hunting buyer can skip the Audi in
favor of the Volkswagen Passat, someone looking to upgrade might find
that the wiser decision is to move to a luxury brand rather than to
pile costly options onto a more plebian model that may have less
resale value, as Nishioka did when he passed up a Honda for a new
Acura.</TE>
<TE>   That twins can differ in such basic characteristics as
performance, ride quality and roominess is no accident.</TE>
<TE>   As buyers get more and more demanding about what they want--and
don't want--car makers design each model for a very particular niche.
And car makers with several brands strive to keep the characteristics
of each unique.</TE>
<TE>   So although the Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Sebring coupes share a
platform with the Mitsubishi Eclipse, the Japanese sport coupe gets a
modified rear suspension and its engine cradle is lowered to provide
a sleeker profile, said Dan Sims, design director at Cypress-based
Mitsubishi Research and Design America.</TE>
<TE>   The platform also is shared by Mitsubishi's Galant sedan, and all
four vehicles are built at the same Mitsubishi plant in Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   But Chrysler designed the exteriors and interiors of the Sebring
and Stratus, and they are larger than the Eclipse.</TE>
<TE>   What the cars share are the PLPs, or principal locating points,
that dictate where the front and rear suspensions, engine and even
the base of the windshield attach when the vehicles are moving down
the assembly line.</TE>
<TE>   It makes it easier, and less costly, to shift from vehicle to
vehicle on the line, and it often allows a plant to use the same
automated machines and metal stamping tooling for different vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler officials estimate that the Mitsubishi and Chrysler Group
vehicles that use the ST platform share about two-thirds of their
parts, mainly items such as brakes, steering units, suspensions and
electrical components that the owners never see.</TE>
<TE>   "That's all," Zverina said. "The stuff that doesn't make the
difference to consumers. They want a bulletproof engine, window lifts
that work. But the other 33% is critically important. The key is
brand distinction--everything the consumer sees, feels or touches,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can completely change the characteristics of the vehicle to
fit a Dodge performance brand image versus a Chrysler luxury image.
Then, if you do the same with the Mitsubishi, you can wind up with
three distinct flavors of a vehicle, which really increases your
manufacturing efficiency," Zverina said. "And by reducing
manufacturing complexity, platform sharing increases quality."</TE>
<TE>   As a result of Chrysler's takeover by Germany's Daimler-Benz to
form DaimlerChrysler, the future will see platform sharing not only
with Mitsubishi but also with DaimlerChrysler's luxury brand,
Mercedes-Benz, Zverina said.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler's Crossfire coupe, scheduled to begin production early
next year, will have a Mercedes engine and drive train, while the
Chrysler Pacifica sport wagon, also due in the first half of 2003,
will have a rear suspension based on that developed for the
Mercedes-Benz E Class.</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler also is planning to build a transmission plant in
Indiana to produce five-speed automatics designed by Mercedes-Benz.
By sharing the transmission among other DaimlerChrysler brands "and
not having to reinvent the wheel, we estimate the savings in research
and development alone will be between $80 million and $100 million,"
Zverina said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can take the [component-sharing] concept all over the map.
Say you're looking at a seat stitching machine. You look in
Stuttgart, you look throughout Mitsubishi's operations and you look
here, within Chrysler's system. You figure out who has the best
machine and the best practice. You order three of those machines ...
you get economies of scale."</TE>

<HD>Sludge Woes Stick to Toyota</HD>
<DH>The auto maker's campaign offering an extended warranty for
oil-sludge damage gets bogged down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH VARTABEDIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc., facing thousands of customer complaints
about engine-damaging oil sludge, began notifying about 3.4 million
Toyota and Lexus owners by letter earlier this year that the company
would provide extended warranty coverage for engine failure or other
problems caused by sludge.</LD>
<LD>   The warranty extension, one of the biggest goodwill campaigns by
the auto industry, was intended to head off concerns that Toyota's
legendary engineering somehow had turned out a large number of
defective engines. Toyota pledged to cover engine damage caused by
sludge for eight years, with no limitation on mileage.</LD>
<LD>   But many owners of vehicles covered by the campaign have contacted
The Times, asking why they have not received their letter.</LD>
<TE>   One of them, Heddy Herbert of Sherman Oaks, owner of a 1997 Toyota
Camry, said she has waited anxiously and called the company to demand
a letter when one had not arrived weeks after the campaign was
announced.</TE>
<TE>   Herbert, who offers scathing reviews of the company's customer
service, said she has observed blue smoke bellowing from her Camry
when she starts it when the engine is cold.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota, hoping to avoid a logjam with its letter campaign, said it
staggered the mailing and that about 75,000 owners have yet to be
notified.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to not mail all the letters at once was based on the
logistical problem of handling that many outgoing letters and the
incoming calls they would generate, said spokesman Mike Michels.</TE>
<TE>   The consumer complaints that triggered the extended warranty
allege that engines were damaged when oil thickened to the
consistency of jello, starving moving parts of lubrication.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the campaign, Toyota has insisted that the problem is
caused by customers' failure to change crankcase oil at least every
7,500 miles, as recommended in their owners' manuals.</TE>
<TE>   But some owners insist that they have routinely changed oil and
that the sludge must be forming because of some defect in the engine
design. The problems have occurred in the company's 3.0-liter V-6 and
2.2-liter four-cylinder engines.</TE>
<TE>   Michels, spokesman for Toyota's North American headquarters in
Torrance, said the company has not altered its assessment that the
failures are caused by owner abuse. Michels said the problem is
limited to the U.S. and Canada, though the engines are used
worldwide. Although it took some prodding to get it started, the
Toyota campaign is an example of the over-the-top customer
satisfaction effort that makes many owners loyal.</TE>
<TE>   Not only is the company covering engine damage, but it also is
providing coverage for towing, storage and documented past repairs,
even those not done by a dealer.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, some owners complain that Toyota is not owning up to
the reality that their engines have a defect that is making them more
susceptible to oil sludge than is normal for gasoline engines.</TE>
<TE>   A Lexus dealership technician contacted Your Wheels earlier this
year and said he is seeing a steady increase in the number of engines
sustaining major damage.</TE>
<TE>   "They all seem to fail at 30,000 miles and we keep getting more
and more," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is causing serious anxiety for many owners.</TE>
<TE>   "How can I protect my '96 Camry LE," wrote Carol Yates. "I am so
worried I bought the wrong car."</TE>
<TE>   If there is a problem, it seems to be affecting a relatively small
number of Toyota owners.</TE>
<TE>   It is important for Toyota owners to change the oil as
recommended, or even more frequently. Many car owners routinely
change oil every 3,000 miles as an insurance policy against costly
engine failures.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Michels recommends that if Toyota owners are concerned or
have questions, they do not need the company letter to act. They can
discuss the problem with their local dealer or call the company.
Toyota owners can call (888) 802-9436 and Lexus owners can call (888)
654-6421.</TE>

<DH>Salon machine airbrushes on makeup for a long-lasting,
natural look.</DH>

<BD>THE WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"It's a completely natural look, but it's flawless."</LD>
<LD>   --Rodney Pinion, makeup artist</LD>
<LD>   Andre Chreky--a salon of exposed brick walls and cappuccinos--now
offers airbrushing at the makeup counter.</LD>
<TE>   Yup, that tool from the '80s has emerged at salons of 2002. And
this is not makeup for pub crawls. Think big days: weddings, fancy
parties, visits to the White House (more on that later). Each
application of makeup is somewhere between $100 and $125. But, you
figure, since it lasts about 12 hours, that boils down to about $10
an hour.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a completely natural look, but it's flawless," says Chreky
makeup artist Rodney Pinion.</TE>
<TE>   The process is basically pointillism, in which tiny dots of color
combine to create a finished effect. To achieve this light finish, a
specialized machine sprays microscopic drops of makeup for fast and
even coverage of foundation, blush, eye shadow, and even brow tint.
The makeup lies on the surface of the skin and allows pores to
breathe instead of clogging them like traditional makeup, and it
dries instantly upon contact, according to the salon.</TE>
<TE>   "I've airbrushed everything but my dog," Pinion says. "And it's
only because I couldn't catch him." Growing up, the ambidextrous
Pinion loved airbrushing model cars and loved makeup. So, learning
how to fuse the two seemed only natural. After taking some
airbrushing classes, he recently introduced it to the salon, though
it's been used in the entertainment industry for years.</TE>
<TE>   The day before I visited Pinion, he airbrushed jazz singer Vanessa
Rubin for her performance at the White House. Rubin sang at the state
dinner for Poland's President Aleksander Kwasniewski, and the next
day a few newspapers ran a photograph of Rubin with her head nestled
on President George W. Bush's lapel.</TE>
<TE>   "And how perfect was that?" said Rubin, laughing, two weeks after
her performance. "I got no makeup on the president or his white
shirt."</TE>
<TE>   It was Rubin's first experience with airbrushing. When Pinion
broke out his Dinair machine and tubes of makeup, she was skeptical,
the singer recalled during a telephone interview. It looked like
"what the dentist uses," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The soulful singer is used to sweating off her makeup in steamy
clubs and "looking like a raccoon by the end of the night." But for
the White House she wanted to look natural but glammy, and she wanted
"smoky eyes" to match her "gun-metal" evening gown.</TE>
<TE>   Though she wasn't in a steamy club, Rubin found herself sweating
just from meeting bigwigs such as Secretary of State Colin Powell,
Henry Kissinger and the president. Even after walking the few
sweltering blocks back to her hotel, the makeup was still in place,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   I was "brushed" on a hazy/hot/humid Washington afternoon. The
process took less than 30 minutes and felt like a light mist that
tickled as it touched my skin. I looked "made up" but was impressed
by how flawless the application was. Pinion even rubbed a tissue
across my face and barely a trace wiped off. And my eyebrows looked
the best I've ever seen them.</TE>
<TE>   After working a full day in the office, I spent another five hours
covering a party, but the makeup was still perfect after I crawled
home. (Pinion puts a light layer of color on the lips and the rest is
lipstick that does need to be reapplied. Also, he uses mascara.)</TE>
<TE>   I didn't get home until after 11 p.m., more than eight hours since
my makeup application, and upon inspection, determined that I still
looked good.</TE>
<TE>   Airbrushed makeup withstands perspiration, humidity, tears--and
maybe even the marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Airbrushing can also be used to quickly highlight hair and cover
tan lines (it washes out in the shower.) Pinion has even covered a
few unsightly tattoos for brides.</TE>
<TE>   MAC and Revlon need not break out in a cold sweat quite yet. Most
machines cost upward of $700 and only a trained hand--like
Pinion's--can smoothly spray makeup an inch from an eyeball without
disaster. But it certainly is addicting.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an entertainer's dream. Better than control top," Rubin
said. "You can be beautiful 24/7 on that stuff, girl."</TE>

<HD>Other Diabetics Keep Boy on Track</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Hanssel is an angry 12-year-old. For six years, he has been
struggling to come to terms with his diabetes. Lately he has been
hanging out on the streets near his downtown apartment. He has been
in and out of foster homes because his single mother has difficulty
managing his diet and insulin shots.</LD>
<LD>   Diabetes can be a great manipulation tool, according to Tamara
Smith, director of operations at Diabetic Youth Services. "If her son
doesn't take his shot, he will go to the hospital, and that means
Social Services will come in again and take him away. It is a common
story for these kids. 'If you don't make me what I want to eat, I'll
pass out, you'll get in trouble.' A parent doesn't want to do that to
her child."</LD>
<LD>   In Hanssel's case, Smith said, "when he is placed back with his
mother, he doesn't always get the support he needs. He lashes out,
and he's put into a foster home until Social Services comes in and
puts him back with his mom again." His inability to deal with his
diabetes lands him in the hospital several times a year.</LD>
<TE>   Camp will provide the seventh-grader, who has been described by
teachers as bright but unmotivated, an opportunity to learn life
skills with other diabetic children. In between the usual dances,
bike riding and catching lizards at Camp Conrad-Chinook, counselors
show campers how to monitor their carbohydrates.</TE>
<TE>   For the three years Hanssel went to camp, doctors reported that he
did very well for about five months following his stay and then
started to slide. "Now he is skipping his shots again, not keeping to
his diet, and those are two major things," said Smith. "It makes it
harder to feel good, harder to concentrate; he gets angry and
depressed."</TE>
<TE>   The camp counselors, 90% of whom are also diabetic, explain the
need to take care of diabetes and show the children that they can
lead normal lives. Smith said that "the kids don't want to be with a
loser who doesn't take care of diabetes. There is a peer pressure to
stay healthy."</TE>
<TE>   She added, "A lot of these kids think they will die at 20. When
they see counselors, it gives them hope; it makes a big difference.
They think it is hilarious that the staff members who are not
diabetic are the ones that are different."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest challenge for Hanssel is to overcome his anger and
accept his diabetes. "Now that he's in his teenage years, he doesn't
want to deal with diabetes," said Smith. "We're trying to teach him
not to let go of all he's learned and to find a way to tell people
he's diabetic and not deny it."</TE>
<TE>   Every year since 1954, readers and employees of The Times have
sent thousands of needy children to summer camp. This year more than
11,000 children will experience a special summer.</TE>
<TE>   The average cost of sending a child to camp for a week is $150.
This year, the McCormick Tribune Foundation will match the first $1.2
million in contributions at 50 cents on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Checks should be sent to: L.A. Times Summer Camp Campaign, File
No. 56984, Los Angeles, CA 90074-6984. For more information, call
(213) 237-5771. To make credit card donations, visit
www.latimes.com/summercamp. Do not send cash.</TE>
<TE>   All donations are tax-deductible. Unless donors request otherwise,
gifts of $25 or more are acknowledged in The Times. The summer camp
campaign is part of the Los Angeles Times Family Fund, a fund of the
McCormick Tribune Foundation.</TE>

<HD>Clothes That Speak to You</HD>
<DH>The Charizmatik line embodies an attempt at substance as
well as style. Sometimes emblazoned with messages, garments feature
their own 'stories.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNELL GEORGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It doesn't take a philosopher to untangle one of urban life's basic
tenets: Clothes are code. If you choose, say, Ecko denims over
Diesel, you've already telegraphed a paragraph.</LD>
<LD>   Whether the message is in a silk-screened flirtation emblazoned
across our chests or a designer's signature stitched across a pocket,
we often assume that it conveys some core stance.</LD>
<LD>   But have we really communicated anything beyond the banal? asks
Freddie Friedler co-founder of an L.A.-based neo-peace/love/dove
garment and accessory line dedicated to digging deeper.</LD>
<TE>   We've become accustomed to the notion that our clothes project an
image, Friedler knew. But could they project one's essence? An
inspiration? Hope for the world?</TE>
<TE>   Friedler figured they could--and he and some college friends set
out to play with the possibilities. The result: Charizmatik, a
freestyle adventure in style and, its founders hope, substance. They
see it as part "fashion factory, part think tank, part global
artistic colony," a lofty goal for a clothing line that likes to
think of itself as blending comfort clothing with comfort words.</TE>
<TE>   Charizmatik got its start seven years ago in Friedler's Loyola
Marymount University dorm room, with the help of classmate Zen
Nishimura, who's now the line's designer.</TE>
<TE>   They started simple, with T-shirts and a fleece pullover inscribed
with "Philosophy," "Nobel Prize" or "Battle Drill" (based on Sun
Tzu's "The Art of War")--antidotes to provocative but pointless
declarations such as, say, shirts proclaiming "I'm with stupid,"
which simply render conversation moot.</TE>
<TE>   "Creating conversation--real conversation--is our mission. We
wanted to do something to combat all the negativity," says Friedler,
who earned both a bachelor's degree in business and an MBA at Loyola.
"I wanted to do something that elevated life, love and
consciousness.... So one night, 4 a.m., we just said: Let's do it."</TE>
<TE>   Friedler's dad and Nishimura's basketball coach floated them
start-up funds, and the duo enlisted the help of fellow LMU
classmates Alex Ross, Ricardo Santos and Zen's younger brother,
Osamu.</TE>
<TE>   To tease the collection to boutiques and buyers in late 1996, they
sent out hand-wrapped copies of Kahlil Gibran's "The Prophet," along
with a note about the new company.</TE>
<TE>   Whether recipients knew it or not, the Charizmatiks were playing
it straight with their choice of Gibran--no raised eyebrows or sly
winks. "It was a book that had a real connection for me and Zen,"
recalls Friedler. "When I needed a lesson or a reminder ... or I get
caught in old patterns, I would pull it out. It has universal truths.
Good reminders--'Work is love made visible.' 'Your joy is your sorrow
unmasked.' So it was very indicative of what we are trying to do ..."
They followed up at the beginning of '97 with the garments
themselves, some juxtaposing the symbols of warfare with messages of
peace--"Listen to your heart," printed on camouflage.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately, the line got the attention of two key outlets--Fred
Segal here on the West Coast, and Union in New York's SoHo. "It was
just pure luck," says Santos, who handles sales and marketing. "And
suddenly we're filling $10,000 orders."</TE>
<TE>   Visibility there helped move the line into boutiques around the
U.S., the U.K., Australia, Japan and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Zen Nishimura conjured up designs such as the clever Universal
Metaphysical League baseball raglan series (featuring teams like the
"New York Non-judgementalists" and the "LA-Lotus minded") and dreamy
button-front shirts dusted with cumulus clouds.</TE>
<TE>   And then there were the stories--from the beginning, each garment
has come with one. Literally. An original haiku, short fiction, a
mantra or a declaration is attached to each garment as a drop tag.
Pieces are written by Ross or, as each season turns, by guest writers
who want to try the form on for size. The tags have a life of their
own, winding up on refrigerators, in wallets, on mirrors and tucked
into journals.</TE>
<TE>   On some garments, hidden messages might be sewn onto the hem--"The
only obstacle is your mind"--or deep inside a pocket--"The capacity
to love is vast: simply open your heart." You might be doing your
laundry, fretting over a decision or question, and like a whisper in
the ear, "pow," says Friedler, "there's the answer."</TE>
<TE>   The Charizmatik crew--ranging in age from 23 to 32--can claim
Buddhist, Jewish, Catholic backgrounds among them. But the members'
spirituality and philosophy, they say, is less classroom-inspired
than life-earned, a mishmash of their own deeper journeys; readings,
music, movies, conversations with self and nature. It's "an
interesting stew," says Ross, and what winds up on the shirts and
tags is fueled as much by whimsy as by riffs on philosophy--for all
of their earnestness, they try to not take themselves too seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to keep it in check. Make fun of ourselves," says Santos,
reading from a tag: "You'll find no turgid rhetoric. No weighty
prose; no compact poetry ... no shaman-like shouts from the
mountaintop; no voluminous works of belief and faith crammed into six
short lines on a cardboard piece of paper within a minuscule
booklet.... Nothing of the sort...."</TE>
<TE>   They opened a store on the eastern end of Melrose Avenue last year
to help them connect more directly with customers, a fanciful
sun-drenched space, hand-hewn with raw wood and knobby tree-branch
fixtures that give the place the feel of a cozy treehouse retreat.
They're philosophical about the date they picked last year for a
grand opening: Sept. 9. It made for more of a struggle than they'd
planned. But in the spirit of resilience, this September they are
throwing a party, launching a tricked-out interactive Web site--with
more stories, poems, photos and video--and will announce a spinoff
line--the Truth Seeker--"at a friendlier price point," says Santos,
than their $134 button-front shirts or $55 long-sleeved T.</TE>
<TE>   Passionate word-of-mouth has carried them this far. Robin Williams
is a Charizmatik addict. Ben Harper is also a fan. And though it
gives the Charizmatik crew a rush to open People magazine and see Ben
Affleck sporting one of its T-shirts, greater satisfaction lies
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "We get really jazzed when people tell us that they were wearing
one of our shirts when they met their girlfriend," says Zen. "Or that
they we're able to make a connection because someone was curious
about what they had on.... It's really about those moments."</TE>

<HD>Time for Mighty Casey to Turn His Back</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Erskine</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mighty Casey comes to bat, 114 years after Ernest Lawrence Thayer's
famous poem.</LD>
<LD>   Casey's now making $6.7 million a year while batting .237. And he
don't sign no stinkin' autographs:</LD>
<LD>   There was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place,</LD>
<TE>   There was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile lit Casey's face.</TE>
<TE>   And when responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his cap,</TE>
<TE>   No stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat.</TE>
<TE>   Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt,</TE>
<TE>   Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them with his shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,</TE>
<TE>   Defiance flashed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip.</TE>
<TE>   And now the pitch came hurtling through the humid August air,</TE>
<TE>   And Casey stood a-watching it--heading for his hair.</TE>
<TE>   Close by the sturdy batsman the forkball spinning sped,</TE>
<TE>   "This ain't right, I'm walking. Blame the union," Casey said.</TE>
<TE>   From the bleachers bright with people, there rose a muffled roar,</TE>
<TE>   Like the beating of the storm waves on a strange and distant
shore,</TE>
<TE>   "If you walk, then we'll walk, too," said the fans, they sounded
certain,</TE>
<TE>   "Go out and leave us hanging, we won't be back; it's curtains."</TE>
<TE>   The team owners, they weren't worried, they'd been through this
before,</TE>
<TE>   Heck, they faced this in 1980, then again in '94.</TE>
<TE>   We have issues fans don't understand, the masses won't get them,
mostly,</TE>
<TE>   Payroll taxes and other things, our billions, we guard them
closely.</TE>
<TE>   "Fraud!" cried the maddened players, "There's fraud across the
land."</TE>
<TE>   Our forefathers went through this for us, Curt Flood, he took a
stand.</TE>
<TE>   If we let owners get their way, they'll take away our millions,</TE>
<TE>   They'll take away our steroids, they'll take away our children.</TE>
<TE>   The sneer hadn't fled from Casey's lips, the teeth were clenched
in hate,</TE>
<TE>   He cursed the owners' egos, he pounded on the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "A salary tax and other things, you'll see what we're about,</TE>
<TE>   We'll fight this to the final cent; we're striking!" he did shout.</TE>
<TE>   And when Casey turned to see them, the faces in the stands,</TE>
<TE>   The mothers and the brothers, his aunt, his Uncle Stan,</TE>
<TE>   No one was there but ushers--a peanut guy, devout,</TE>
<TE>   "Nuts! Nuts! Nuts! to all of you, the fans have all walked out."</TE>

<HD>In Order to See the First Pitch, 'Operation: Parking Space'
Begins</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We took the kids to a Dodger game and we went by a way that was so
sneaky and traffic-free that I'm not even going to mention it. As we
were scooting through the entrance kiosk, we congratulated ourselves
on achieving, at long last, tension-free travel. And then we hit the
parking lot.</LD>
<LD>   At 4:45 last Sunday, spread out beneath the slight rise of the
Elysian Park entrance, the parking lot of Dodger Stadium glittered
menacingly. This is anthropomorphism of the most unrestrained kind--a
parking lot is not capable of any action, much less one with intent.
But that is what it did. It glittered. Menacingly.</LD>
<LD>   Up one row and down the other, windshields and windows shone flat
silver like the bellies of a thousand anchovies washed up on the
beach, and the symbolic portent was just about the same. Something
evil was rising, something we thought we could outrun, outthink,
outmaneuver. But, of course, we could not. We were going to have to
face down the inevitable specter of Parking Lot Anxiety.</LD>
<TE>   For me it begins as a churning drop in the stomach, followed by a
breathlessness that makes me gulp for air a bit like a goldfish
eating and causes my remarks to come in tommy-gun, declarative bursts
that include a lot of direct appeals to the Almighty. I quickly
realize we are never going to find a parking space, that if we get
out of this alive it will be more than we deserve, that we were
fools, fools, to ever think we could go to a Dodger
game/Disneyland/Costco/the state fair when clearly we should have
stayed at home playing endless games of Candy Land and Red
Light/Green Light like families are supposed to.</TE>
<TE>   Then I notice that it's not just cars that fill this parking lot,
it's also people. Strings of people, many of them hand-holding
families and all headed in the same direction. Now my skin starts to
itch, and the top of my head heats up so I can visualize the air
above it shimmering. I'm an American, I pay taxes, I bought my
ticket, I can certainly take my children to a baseball game/theme
park/seasonal event with everyone else if I want to.</TE>
<TE>   But we had better hurry the heck up and find a parking space or
all the good stuff--the seats and churros, short lines and
commemorative pins, not to mention the lifetime supply of money and
medical supplies and the free passes to heaven--are going to be gone.</TE>
<TE>   This is about the time I begin giving urgent, pointed advice to my
husband if he is driving, or to the cars around me if I am driving.
You can imagine how pleasant that is for everyone involved.</TE>
<TE>   When we at last find a parking space, I spring into action like a
blood-frenzied panther. In one motion, I turn off the car, get out of
the car, lean into the car and get the kids out of the car while my
husband is still unlatching his seat belt. I grab the diaper bag and
the stroller and the sweatshirts and the hats, thrust small feet into
shoes, find naked baby dolls and propel the whole mess ever forward
as if there were alarms sounding while the boat listed starboard and
men in oilskin sou'westers lowered the lifeboats into the icy sea.</TE>
<TE>   All around me people surge past and cars add themselves to the
grid and my mouth fills with the brackish taste of dread. We will get
there just as the man who guards the gate of the ballpark/zoo/Irish
Fair--who in my mind's eye resembles the man with the green furry hat
who tried to turn Dorothy away from seeing the wizard--is drawing it
closed, and slapping a "SOLD OUT, GO AWAY, YOU" sign on it.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, my husband is working up that small frown he gets
whenever he is about to ask me if I've eaten anything today. (When I
was pregnant, he used to carry packages of crackers in his pockets
the way people in the '80s carried Valium.) But by then we are
moving, and I can begin to relax. The car is parked, and if there are
hundreds of people ahead of us, there are even more behind us. We
will get there, enjoy ourselves and all will be well.</TE>
<TE>   Until, of course, it's time to leave.</TE>

<LD>Exploring the Baby Universe</LD>
<LD>   What if you could look back in time? Where would you look? Would
you check out the beginning of the American Revolution to see how it
all got started? Imagine going all the way back more than 65 million
years to see dinosaurs roaming the Earth!</LD>
<LD>   This year, NASA will launch a new telescope into space to look
back in time at the universe. The Galaxy Evolution Explorer, or
GALEX, will orbit Earth and peer back through 10 billion years of
cosmic history. Scientists will use GALEX to learn how baby galaxies
change into mature ones, like our Milky Way.</LD>
<TE>   Light travels faster than anything else in the universe, but still
not anywhere near fast enough for us to see events in deep space
while they are happening.</TE>
<TE>   Light traveling from a star 1 million light-years away takes a
million years to reach Earth. So we can only see that star as it
appeared 1 million years ago. GALEX will look back at many galaxies
as they grew up in the universe to find out how they made their
stars.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine asking every student in your school to tell you his or her
first word as a baby. As an example, let's say most of the kids said
"doggy." What would you know from the answers? You might not learn
much about individual kids, but you would know which words all the
kids in your school had in common. You might guess that most kids had
dogs when they were babies. GALEX will work a bit the same way. It
will "ask questions" of lots of young galaxies to find out what they
might have in common.</TE>

own mobile of beautiful galaxies, go to

<HD>Donating a Miracle</HD>
<DH>Julie Michaels had only a passing acquaintance with Carrie
Mehdi. But that didn't stop her from giving Mehdi a lifesaving
gift--a kidney.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The problem with having a phone company message center rather than an
answering machine is that the messages get erased after a certain
number of weeks. Zafar Mehdi didn't know this until, for something
like the 7,000th time, he went to listen to the message that saved
his wife's life and found that it was gone.</LD>
<LD>   It was the kind of message a person would want to save, the kind
of message you usually only get in a really good dream, the kind that
couldn't possibly be real. Except it was.</LD>
<LD>   Although the actual recording has been lost, all of the parties
involved--Zafar and his wife, Carrie, and the caller, Julie
Michaels--remember it quite clearly. It went like this: "Hi, Carrie,
this is Julie Michaels. You may not remember me, but we met briefly
at that holiday party and sat next to each other at the Sierra
Breeding Club meeting. Anyway, I heard you need a kidney, and if it
turns out we match, I would be honored if you would accept one of
mine."</LD>
<TE>   Zafar was the first to hear the message. "Honey," he called into
the bedroom, his voice rising a bit, "Carrie, you should listen to
this message. I think this woman is sincere."</TE>
<TE>   Carrie listened to the message and stared at her husband. She
listened to the message and tried not to laugh or cry, tried to
remain absolutely calm. She listened to the message and tried to
remember, tried to conjure an image of this woman, this Julie
Michaels.</TE>
<TE>   Fatal Kidney Disease</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, Carrie had been diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease,
a genetic degenerative condition that leads invariably to the loss of
kidney function. Her grandfather had died of it; her father had died
of it. In 1997, her 41-year-old brother died of complications
associated with the illness.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Carrie went into renal failure and had to go on dialysis.
Extreme fatigue soon forced her to quit her job as an interior
decorator. In spring 2001, she got on the list at UCLA's transplant
program; the average wait is six years for what would probably be a
kidney harvested from a cadaver. Such an organ might last eight
years, a kidney from a living donor twice that. At the time of
Julie's call, Carrie was 48.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty or 30 times, she punched the replay button and listened to
the message before she could summon the courage to call the woman
back. Carrie tried to explain to Julie that although she appreciated
the offer very, very much, Julie needed to know that there was a lot
involved in donating a kidney to a stranger. Tests, days of tests,
weeks of tests, to determine if the women's blood and tissue types
were compatible, to see if Julie was healthy enough to donate an
organ and if she had any predisposition to diabetes or other
conditions that might trouble her own kidneys in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I know all that," Julie said. She worked for a medical
center, as an executive assistant, and she had already talked to
their transplant specialists and a nephrologist. Her only concern had
been what life would be like with just one kidney. Same as before,
she was told; people only need one kidney.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm O positive," Carrie said, facing the first hurdle.</TE>
<TE>   "Perfect, so am I," said Julie. From that moment on, she would say
later, she knew it was all going to work out just fine.</TE>
<TE>   Well, OK, said Carrie, not knowing quite what to say--what do you
say when a woman you've met only three times offers you one of her
organs?--I'll call UCLA and we'll go from there. Great, said Julie,
and then they hung up. Carrie called Suzanne McGuire, a coordinator
of UCLA's kidney and transplant programs. McGuire told her they could
not call Julie--transplant programs must be excruciatingly careful to
avoid an appearance of solicitation. Julie would have to call them.</TE>
<TE>   Carrie, McGuire said, was understandably very excited and
emotional. McGuire tried to sound optimistic but realistic. Most
living donors are blood relations to the recipients; those who aren't
invariably have long-term emotional ties. "We don't get a lot of
cases of relative strangers," McGuire said. "And it's something we
are cautious about because there's always a chance there is another
motive involved, usually money. We encourage the recipient to give
such a thing a little thought--I asked her how well she knew this
person, did she feel comfortable receiving an organ from her."</TE>
<TE>   What Carrie knew about Julie made her feel perfectly comfortable.
In their first conversation, and as they subsequently grew to be
friends, Julie told her this was an unconditional offer. Carrie had
no misgivings. She called Julie and gave her McGuire's number. Less
than a month later, Julie was on her way to UCLA for the first round
of tests.</TE>
<TE>   Both Dachshund Lovers</TE>
<TE>   Here is the most important thing Carrie knew about Julie when
Julie made her offer: Like Carrie, she was the passionate owner of
dachshunds. In August 2000, one of Julie's dogs died, of liver and
kidney failure. It was nine months before Julie would allow herself
to consider getting another dog; when she did, she chose a puppy with
sight problems. She took the new dog, Dixie, to an informal
gathering, and judging, of dachshunds. Carrie gave the little dog,
who had to be carried into the ring, fourth prize.</TE>
<TE>   Here is the most important thing Julie knew about Carrie: She had
a son, Gregory, 18, who looked strikingly like Julie's own son,
Andrew, 24. In January, Julie saw the two of them across the crowd of
a holiday party. She could not get over the resemblance between the
two young men.</TE>
<TE>   A month after that holiday party, she wound up sitting next to
Carrie at a dog club meeting and when Carrie suggested organizing a
fund-raiser to start a dachshund rescue, Julie could not have agreed
more. Then she remembered the boy who looked like her boy and felt an
instant kinship.</TE>
<TE>   After the meeting, she asked a friend about Carrie, and the woman
happened to mention that Carrie needed a kidney. Again, Julie thought
of Carrie's child. Julie looked at the woman, and then at the room
full of people, many of whom knew Carrie quite well. And she asked
what seemed to her a natural question.</TE>
<TE>   "Has anyone offered her one?" she asked. The woman looked a bit
taken aback and shook her head. Julie didn't understand it. Here was
this perfectly nice woman who needed something desperately, and yet
no one was offering. She heard something almost as if it were
whispered in her ear. "Offer yours," that something said.</TE>
<TE>   Julie is 4 feet, 9 inches tall, which means she is too small to
even give a full pint of blood. Six years before, after watching her
husband donate platelets at the hospital where they then both worked,
she had had her platelets typed and put on file. Eventually, she
donated some to a boy who needed a bone marrow transplant. Beyond
that, she had no connection with organ or tissue donation at all,
knew of no recipients, no other donors.</TE>
<TE>   But it seemed to her, when she thought about it, a very obvious
and normal thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   For Carrie, finding a living donor had seemed an impossibility.
Her mother was too old, her brother had been her only sibling. There
was a cousin she wasn't close to, and her husband's blood type did
not match hers. She, too, wondered about some of her friends, whether
they might match, but she could never bring herself to ask them.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't ask," she said. "You just can't. You tell people about
your condition and you hope that someone might offer, but you can
never ask. And it is hard. Because I would look at some people who I
was close to and wonder why they didn't offer. I would think, if it
were me, I would offer, and maybe they didn't care about me the same
way I cared about them. I didn't want to think like that. I really
hated it. But you can't not."</TE>
<TE>   Each year, 5,000 Americans die while on waiting lists for organ
transplants. Last year, only 14% of living kidney donations were made
by people unrelated to the recipient, according to the United Network
for Organ Sharing, a national database for organ transplants. The
"unrelated" category is not specific, but it is likely that most of
the donations involved a previous relationship--the donors were
friends, co-workers or fellow parishioners of the recipient or their
family--although half of 1% were given by anonymous donors to various
transplant programs. "It is not unheard of for a relative stranger to
donate," says Ann Plaschke, a spokeswoman for the database, "but it
is pretty rare."</TE>
<TE>   Julie waited a couple of weeks to see if the urge to make the
offer would go away. It didn't. One night she approached her husband
in their Placentia home. "Honey," she said, "how would you feel if I
offered to donate my kidney to that woman I told you about?"</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Michaels was not surprised at all. He knew his wife, knew she
believed if not in a church-defined God then in a universal power
that often guided our actions, our lives. He had heard something in
the back of her voice when she had told him about Carrie a week or so
before, about how no one had offered her a kidney. He too remembered
Carrie's son, the resemblance to his son. He didn't even blink. "Tell
you what," he said, "if you're not a match, then I'll get tested
too."</TE>
<TE>   July 15 was their 25th wedding anniversary. The year before, they
had made plans to spend it in Tahiti. After she decided to donate her
kidney, it became clear that the timing would not work out so they
canceled their trip and booked a cruise. When it turned out that the
operation would be scheduled in mid-July, they canceled the cruise as
well.</TE>
<TE>   Julie shrugs it off. "I would have liked to go to Tahiti," she
said, "but this seemed more rewarding."</TE>
<TE>   The first tests on March 26 revealed that although they were not a
perfect tissue match, they were compatible. New drugs have made a
perfect tissue match unnecessary, McGuire said, although a genetic
match is always preferable. The two women were about the same age,
each had had similar childhood illnesses and only one pregnancy, so
their antigens were remarkably similar.</TE>
<TE>   "We later found out we each had relatives that came over on the
Mayflower," said Julie. "So maybe we are related. I mean, that was a
very small boat."</TE>
<TE>   In April, Julie had her psychiatric consultation, or as she puts
it, "the foil-helmet test. They wanted to make sure I didn't hear
voices coming from the TV when it was turned off," she said, "that I
didn't hear God talking directly to me, that I wasn't doing this
because I was crazy. I kept telling them, I just felt in my gut that
it was the right thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   All potential donors are required to undergo an evaluation to
protect both the donor and the recipient. "You hear a story like this
and you think the person must be crazy," said Dr. Albin Gritsch,
surgical director of renal transplant. "But there are a lot of people
who do generous and altruistic things. We just need to make sure that
altruism is the real motivation."</TE>
<TE>   According to Gritsch, the waiting list at UCLA and other
transplant programs has grown significantly as demand for
transplants--spurred by high success rates--outstrips supply. In the
last few years, nonrelative donors have also increased, he said, as
those on the waiting list cast about outside their families for other
resources.</TE>
<TE>   Julie passed the psych test, and all the physical evaluations. On
June 1, the two women, who had talked to each other on the phone
almost every day for the past two months, met each other for the
first time since Julie's offer. The two couples went out to dinner at
a restaurant in Costa Mesa. If anyone had any doubts, they were
dispelled by this evening.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never laughed so hard in my life," said Julie. "It was
like it was meant to be."</TE>
<TE>   "We felt like we had known each other for years," said Jeff.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Saturday evening, they are once again gathered for
dinner, this time in the Mehdis' Glendale home. Dachshund statues
stalk across the coffee table in the living room, ribbons from
Carrie's champions spill from a bench in the dining room. Julie is
petting one of the dogs. Carrie looks at them and says: "You know,
it's funny to think that if it hadn't been for those dogs, this would
have never happened."</TE>
<TE>   Both of the women have been home from the hospital for
weeks--after the July 24 surgery, Julie was in the hospital for only
two days, Carrie for six. Julie is happy to show off her scars, or at
least the four that are above her bellybutton--inch-long marks where
the laparoscopes were inserted. She was on the table for almost four
hours. To remove a kidney, the surgeons had to put her on her side,
with her hands over her head, and keep her there; the most pain she
suffered later was in her back and neck from being in that position
so long.</TE>
<TE>   Julie went under the knife first. When her kidney was removed, it
was taken to an adjoining operating theater and put right into
Carrie. The moment it was attached, Carrie began producing urine.</TE>
<TE>   'Things Can Work Out'</TE>
<TE>   "Look at her," Julie says, as Carrie rises from the sofa to serve
dinner. "She looks great; she looks like it never happened. I also
think it's great for Gregory," she says when Carrie has left the
room, "for him to see that you don't have to die from this, that
things can work out."</TE>
<TE>   Gregory, as it turns out, also inherited the condition though has
shown no symptoms; Zafar is a match for him and could donate one of
his kidneys if the need were to arise.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second dinner the couples have had since the
operation; this time Julie and Jeff brought the bottle of Dom
Perignon they had been saving for their anniversary. Both the women
are allowed to drink alcohol, neither of their diets has changed,
although Carrie will take anti-rejection drugs for the rest of her
life. The initial high dosage has left her ankles and cheeks puffy,
but that will soon disappear. Julie is aware that she no longer has a
spare kidney and so must be careful with the one she's got; she was
told she shouldn't skydive or practice martial arts, limitations she
thinks she can live with. "I went skydiving on my 30th birthday," she
says. "That was enough."</TE>
<TE>   The women seem easy with each other. They both say they feel they
have gained a sister.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just amazing," says Carrie. "We have the same sense of
humor, the same political views, we like the same food."</TE>
<TE>   They tell and retell the story of what has happened to them just
as new mothers or the survivors of a calamity work and rework the
narrative of their ordeals. They want other people to know that you
can donate a kidney to a stranger and be better, not worse for it.
"It's a miracle," says Carrie, calmly, "that I've now got a piece of
Julie inside me ... and a year ago we didn't know each other."</TE>
<TE>   Six months after hearing a voice on her phone message center, she
finally believes it was real.</TE>

<LD>"Nadia the Willful"</LD>
<LD>   by Sue Alexander</LD>
<LD>   Nadia is a girl whose stubbornness and flashing temper cause her
to be known throughout the desert. Her father, Tarik, is kind,
gracious and praised in every tent. Hamed is the oldest of Nadia's
six brothers and the favorite son of Tarik. He is the only one who
can calm Nadia's temper when it flashes.</LD>
<TE>   But one day before dawn, Hamed mounts his father's white stallion
and rides to the west to seek ground for the sheep. Hamed does not
return. Nadia and her father search but they do not find him.</TE>
<TE>   Tarik is so upset that a new rule is put out. He says that no one
will speak Hamed's name. Those who do will be punished for reminding
him of what he has lost.</TE>
<TE>   Nadia couldn't stand not talking about her brother. She talks
about him for days. She tells her father, "You don't see his face.
You don't recognize his voice. I could help you."</TE>
<TE>   Tarik speaks again. Read the book to find out what he says.</TE>

<HD>Handling Mail for Salinger Is an Eye-Opener</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every culture has its central rite of passage--a pilgrimage, a quest,
a time of testing.</LD>
<LD>   For Americans and their cultural fellow travelers, the defining
experience is adolescent alienation. What better preparation, after
all, for life in a society where the worship of autonomy has turned
individualism into isolation?</LD>
<LD>   Hence the enduring popularity of J.D. Salinger and his iconically
alienated creations, Holden Caulfield and the family Glass.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this year, for example, Web sites across the Internet
fairly vibrated with excitement over reports that the reclusive
author would soon be bringing out his long-anticipated, book-length
version of "Hapworth 16, 1924," which appeared as a novella in a 1965
issue of the New Yorker. Amazon.com even began booking advance
orders. But although Salinger's agent and publisher confirmed that
such a manuscript exists, both denied that publication was imminent.</TE>
<TE>   Salinger, in fact, has not published new work in almost 40 years,
which is why the September/October issue of Book magazine promises to
be something of an event. It contains an article by novelist Joanna
Smith Rakoff--"My Salinger Year"--in which she recounts the months
she spent working as a secretary at Harold Ober Associates, the
Manhattan literary agency that represents the author of "The Catcher
in the Rye."</TE>
<TE>   One of her duties at the agency was answering the author's fan
mail, an assignment that was hers because Salinger refuses to read or
even to take receipt of the letters that continue to pour in from
around the world.</TE>
<TE>   How Rakoff changed the way the mail was handled--and how she, in
turn, was changed by it--is the narrative spine of her extended
reflection on Salinger's enduring popularity.</TE>
<TE>   Her story, which included a meeting with Salinger, is a source of
satisfaction to Book's editor, Jerome V. Kramer. ["Salinger is the
Holy Grail for people on the pop cultural side of the literary
world," he said. "He is so successfully secretive that anything that
provides this sort of neat insight into him is fascinating.</TE>
<TE>   "Salinger still captures our imagination because the wisdom and
specificity of his characters have made him the philosopher of
adolescence," Kramer said, "and I think this piece helps explain why
new generations are still being drawn to him at a certain period in
their lives. Part of his appeal is that nobody has ever come up with
a better strategy for maintaining their integrity in this
media-saturated culture than by bowing out of it. Just getting a
glimpse of him, as you do in Joanna's piece, is a reaffirmation for
many people."</TE>
<TE>   Committed Salingerites probably will delight in Rakoff's crisp
description of their idol's current living arrangements:</TE>
<TE>   "Finally, you need to go to New Hampshire, where a tall, dark-eyed
man meditates in the back room of his simple, wood-frame house. In
his eighties now and mostly deaf, he thrives on routine: Each
morning, he rises, eats breakfast, kisses his wife goodbye and heads
to his study, where he meditates and, allegedly, writes. He is a
Buddhist, a vegetarian, the son of a man who made his living
processing meat. His wife, 30 years his junior, is a nurse at the
local hospital. She enjoys weaving tapestries. He enjoys watching
television. A satellite dish crowns the top of their farmhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "Every five years or so, he visits New York, the city in which he
was born and raised, the city he made intimate--and eccentrically
romantic--for several generations of readers. He hates the city now,
but he needs to come, needs to meet with his agent [Phyllis
Westberg], make sure she's handling the business of his books in
exactly the way he likes. He visits her office and they head out to
lunch. He says hello to the low-voiced girl who assists his agent,
the girl who fields his questions about royalties and contracts,
repeating her answers three and four times on the days when he
doesn't feel like using his special amplified phone, bought for him
by his wife."</TE>
<TE>   When she was first assigned to answer Salinger's mail, Rakoff
recalls, she was handed "a few crumbling, yellowed carbon copies of
sample responses," composed in the 1960s. At first, she used them,
but gradually her impression of Salinger's fans changed. They were,
she writes "smart. They were misfits. And, for all their cynical
posturing, what they loved about Holden was not just his smart-alecky
whining or his refusal to conform to adult expectations, but his
hopeless, dewy-eyed naivete, his utter idealism.</TE>
<TE>   "If Holden were to write a letter to Salinger, he too would hope
to hell that somehow, some way, that irascible hermit would write a
... letter back."</TE>
<TE>   And since the hermit wouldn't, Rakoff did--individual, not form,
replies. She was particularly taken with a remarkably eloquent and
sincere 16-year-old from North Carolina, who had read "The Catcher in
the Rye" three times and hoped one day to write a novel like it of
his own. Rakoff had the boy's letter in her desk drawer one day in
1996, when she met Salinger face to face.</TE>
<TE>   Two questions occur:</TE>
<TE>   "'You are probably wondering, right about now," she writes, "if I
signed my own name to the letters I wrote to Salinger's fans--or if I
actually pretended to be Salinger, signed a loopy 'J.D.' at the
bottom of the page."</TE>
<TE>   And, finally, what did Rakoff do when she finally met the author?</TE>
<TE>   "When the actual J.D. Salinger--with his thin gray hair and
saucer-sized ears and self-deprecating smile--visited our office,"
she writes, "I shook his hand (or, really, he shook mine), said,
'Nice to meet you,' smoothed my skirt and turned back to my typing.
In my desk lay the letter from North Carolina, two neatly typed
pages, unfurled from a laser printer, and ending:</TE>
<TE>   " 'I'll write you again soon. I can hardly wait. Anyway, my line
of thought is this: If I was the guy who put myself onto paper and I
came out in the form of "The Catcher in the Rye," I'd get a bang out
of the [person] who had the nerve to write me a letter pretending
(and wanting) to be able to do the same thing.'</TE>
<TE>   "As the door to my boss' smoke-clogged office closed, a thought
slashed through my brain: What if I gave Salinger the letter?"</TE>
<TE>   So, did Rakoff sign her replies with Salinger's name? Did she
violate his decades-long order and hand him the letter from the young
man whose idealism and sincerity had touched her so deeply--made him,
in her eyes, worthy of his idol's notice?</TE>
<TE>   The answers, along with other things worth knowing, can be found
in the forthcoming issue of Book magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Berrigan, now 82, is a Jesuit priest, peace activist and
the author of more than 50 books, including "The Trial of the
Catonsville Nine":</TE>
<TE>   "I am just finishing reading the proofs for a book that will be
coming out in a couple of months. It grows out of our common
experience of Sept. 11 here in New York and is a study of the Book of
Lamentations of Jeremiah from the Hebrew Bible. It just seemed to me
very apropos of what we have been through here. When I began reading
that book again shortly after Sept. 11, I thought it offered a
genuine biblical counterpoint to the ethos of revenge and war that
has so thoroughly gripped Mr. Bush and those around him.</TE>
<TE>   "The Lamentations seemed to me to be a book trying to guide us
through our recovery from anger and grief by going through them
rather than taking refuge in retaliation. It runs the whole emotional
gamut experienced by those of us who have taken care of survivors and
the families of those who didn't survive. It points the way to
something better than killing for killing, which is mainly what our
government has offered us."</TE>

<HD>But Does It Fit on the Court?</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There has not, perhaps, been such a fashion flap in tennis since
"Gorgeous Gussie" Moran appeared at Wimbledon 53 years ago sporting
lace panties under her white tennis dress.</LD>
<LD>   Tongues were wagging Monday as Serena Williams took to the court
for her first-round match of the U.S. Open wearing a
leave-little-to-the-imagination black Lycra number that resembled a
mini-wetsuit, explaining that "it makes me run faster and it's really
sexy."</LD>
<LD>   Author Karen Grigsby Bates was among those who thought she'd gone
too far. "She's a great athlete. She has a great body. But this is
disco wear on the tennis court. I don't know what the U.S. Open was
thinking" to permit someone to play in such an outfit.</LD>
<TE>   She adds, "Just because it's permissible doesn't mean it's
appropriate. Serena is sending two completely opposite messages, with
the tiara and the pearl bracelet, on one hand, and this rather
astonishing display of her physical assets on the other.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not one of those people who think that women only have to
play tennis in dresses with little ruffled panties to match ... but
this is over the edge."</TE>
<TE>   While rising to the top of the rankings, 20-year-old Serena and
older sister Venus have never been fashion conformists. First, it was
the hair beads--since discarded--that fell off during matches,
clattering around the courts and annoying their opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Serena has designed a line of clothing for Puma and has dyed her
hair blond in an effort, she explained, to keep from being
recognized.</TE>
<TE>   Now, she's brought urban in-your-face fashion to a sport that
traditionally belonged not to two African American women reared in
Compton, but to the elite country-club set.</TE>
<TE>   Is there some sort of deep sociological significance in this?</TE>
<TE>   "I think they've gotten to the point where they have no more
worlds to conquer, so there's a bit more of that in-your-face," says
psychologist Joyce Brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Brothers points to studies showing that women who wear very
revealing clothing "have less self-esteem than those who don't show
off. [Serena and Venus] are both really sturdy women, not the kind of
women that men would fantasize about taking to bed. They would
fantasize maybe about beating them on the tennis courts."</TE>
<TE>   She adds, "I think what they're trying to do now is to shock
people into realizing that you can be built for athletics and still
be sexy. I think that they're reassuring themselves as well, sort of
thumbing their noses at the crowd, saying, 'Look, I may be at the top
of my game, but I'm a woman as well.' "</TE>
<TE>   From a fashion perspective, the cat suit was a hit. "Her fashion
sense and her total brilliance on the tennis court is emerging into
something very unique," says Andre Leon Talley, editor-at-large at
Vogue. "I loved the cat suit. I love her hair. It's all part of her
being a champion. She'll become a role model for young girls,
aspiring for fashion."</TE>
<TE>   Like it or not, all that matters is that "she was dressed and she
was able to perform," says Helen Grieco, executive director of
California National Organization for Women, pointing out that NOW
worked very hard to see that, through Title IX, female athletes had
the opportunity to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   Is there a hint of racism in the response to fashion,
Serena-style? "There might be," says Grieco, as well as sexism. She
points out that John McEnroe could stamp around the court, swearing
at umpires, and people tended to dismiss his errant behavior as a
"boys will be boys" thing.</TE>
<TE>   As for fashion rebels, when Andre Agassi burst on the tennis scene
in the late '80s, unshaven, with pierced ears and long hair, wearing
neon-colored clothing and denim--in an era when crisp white shorts
were all but mandatory--fans couldn't get enough of him (especially
the female fans).</TE>
<TE>   But when the Williams sisters brought their power game to tennis,
quickly rising to the top of the ranks, some other female
players--notably former No. 1 Martina Hingis--didn't hesitate to
suggest that they were landing multimillion-dollar clothing
endorsements because they were African American.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly their flashy styles didn't hurt. But on the court,
tennis is Serena's job, Bates points out, "and she doesn't want to
dress in a way that detracts from her work. Certainly if she worked
at a bank or a law office or a brokerage firm, if her skirt was too
short or her blouse too low, they would tell her to change her
clothes."</TE>
<TE>   Her advice to Serena: "I want people to think of you as dazzling,
attractive and fine and graceful, but they are getting distracted by
what you wear."</TE>
<TE>   Harold Koda, curator of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, says that "all of the precepts of the old
establishment, with very few exceptions, have encompassed the
increasing diversity of the American population. If most Americans
embrace the sense of American meritocracy it's going to mean some
expressions, ideological as well as aesthetic, that are going to be
alarming to us. I suppose part of it is this attitude that if you
participate in certain things, you play by the rules. I'm not an
advocate of the eroding of every standard, but I'm surprised that
people are surprised."</TE>
<TE>   He makes an analogy between Serena challenging traditional tennis
fashion and people wearing shorts on airplanes. "It used to be the
precinct of the privileged to travel. It's not anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Marcy DeVeaux, who teaches "Women and the Media" at Cal State
Northridge, says, "The Williams sisters have been my example of
strong, vibrant, attractive women who are not sexualized. They're
healthy. They look like women their age should look. They're not
emaciated."</TE>
<TE>   She adds, "I think Serena can play tennis in a tennis skirt and
probably do quite well. I don't know that a skin-tight black Lycra
suit will help her game really, so why do it?"</TE>
<TE>   Staff writer Gayle Pollard-Terry contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>"Omma (Mom), why did you and Dad name me Nellie instead of giving me
a Korean name?" Nellie wanted to know.</LD>
<LD>   "Because I became an American citizen, and you are an American by
birth. You were born right here in California," Ok Cha (Jade Child)
told her daughter. "We both thought it would be easier for you to
have just one name, one nationality."</LD>
<LD>   Mrs. Connors made a hanbok (a traditional gown) for Nellie to wear
when she greeted her grandfather for the first time. Nellie delighted
in wearing her bright blue gown with broad white-and-gold stripes on
the sleeves and a bow in the front. She practiced kneeling and bowing
to show respect for her oe haraboji (grandfather).</LD>
<TE>   Nellie learned that on special occasions, grandchildren are
expected to get on their knees in front of their grandparents and bow
almost to the floor. For Nellie, this seemed like being a costumed
actor on stage.</TE>
<TE>   There were some things about her grandfather's arrival that
bothered Nellie.</TE>
<TE>   "Why must I give up my room to my oe haraboji when he comes?" She
complained at dinner one evening. "Why can't he have the little
sewing room instead of me having to move?"</TE>
<TE>   She thought of how cramped her books and Beanie Babies would be in
the smaller room. And where would she put Barbie's clothes and
accessories?</TE>
<TE>   The more she thought about it, the more upset Nellie felt.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see that you have not yet understood," her father replied.
"To offer your larger room to your grandfather is a privilege, not a
burden."</TE>
<TE>   "In time, you will see this," her mother added.</TE>
<TE>   But Nellie was not convinced. Inwardly, she pouted over the
inconvenience.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: How will Nellie handle the changes being made in the
Connors' household?</TE>
<TE>   Tori Smith is a freelance writer from Tucson. She is the aunt of

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's a summer entertaining menu that keeps things easy for the
cook. The paella, served with grilled chicken and shellfish, is
adapted to serve at room temperature. That means all the cooking is
done in advance without compromising the dish.</LD>
<LD>   Long-grain rice works best for the paella, rather than traditional
short grain or Arborio rice, which in testing became unpleasantly
thick and clumpy on standing.</LD>
<LD>   I like to grill chicken legs and three varieties of shellfish for
paella; they make for an inviting dish. But you can simplify this
selection to your taste. You can also substitute a spicy sausage for
the chicken and/or calamari in the seafood mix.</LD>
<TE>   The rest of the meal? Melon with prosciutto or guacamole with
chips work here with drinks. A salad of thinly sliced pickling
cucumbers tossed in seasoned rice vinegar and chives is just the kind
of refreshing, crunchy salad that paella requires. Crusty bread and
butter. And a simple summer dessert, fresh peach melba. The raspberry
sauce is actually the melba; here, it tops sliced peaches and vanilla
ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   Mandel is a cookbook author.</TE>
<TE>   Paella</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 35 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 large onion, diced</TE>
<TE>   1 green bell pepper, diced</TE>
<TE>   1 jalapeno, seeded if desired, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon minced garlic</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 cups rice</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons paprika (preferably Hungarian)</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth</TE>
<TE>   1 (8-ounce) bottle clam juice</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup dry white wine (or dry vermouth)</TE>
<TE>   8 green cracked olives, pitted, flesh slivered</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon crumbled saffron threads</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon coarse salt</TE>
<TE>   1 bay leaf</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 cup frozen baby peas, thawed</TE>
<TE>   1 cup young corn kernels, cut from cob</TE>
<TE>   Lime wedges, for serving</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a large paella pan or 12-inch nonstick skillet
over medium-high heat. When hot, add the onion, green pepper,
jalapeno and garlic. Cook until the onion is slightly softened,
stirring often, about 5 minutes. Add the rice and paprika and cook,
stirring, for 2 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Add the chicken broth, clam juice, white wine, olives, saffron,
salt, bay leaf and pepper to taste. Stir well. Bring to a boil.
Simmer, covered, until the rice is just tender, about 16 minutes.
It's OK if there's extra liquid; the rice will absorb it as it
stands. Remove from the heat. Stir in the peas and corn. (This can be
made a day ahead and refrigerated. To serve, let the rice come to
room temperature or warm slightly in a microwave oven.) Taste; adjust
the seasoning. Serve at room temperature (right in the paella pan, if
using), garnished with lime wedges. Serve the grilled shellfish and
chicken on a separate platter.</TE>

<TE>   Place the chicken legs in a plastic food bag; add 1/3 cup of the
oil mixture. Marinate in the refrigerator at least 4 hours or
overnight. Let come to room temperature before grilling.</TE>
<TE>   Soak the clams and mussels in cold water to cover with 2 teaspoons
salt for 30 minutes to purge any sand inside their shells. Rinse in
cold water; keep chilled until cooking time.</TE>
<TE>   Spray a barbecue grate (and grilling plate or basket if needed to
keep small items from falling through grate) with cooking spray. Heat
the grill to medium.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the chicken from the marinade (discard marinade), sprinkle
with salt and pepper to taste and grill until cooked as desired; the
juices should run clear when the chicken is pricked with a fork,
about 35 to 40 minutes. Grill the shrimp, clams and mussels in
separate batches as they have different (but quick) timing. Grill
shrimp, turning once, until just opaque, about 1 to 2 minutes total;
do not overcook. Grill the clams until most shells open, about 4 to 5
minutes (discard any that do not open); grill the mussels until the
shells open, about 3 minutes (discard any that do not open). As each
batch of shellfish is grilled, put in its own bowl. While still hot,
toss with about 3 tablespoons of the oil mixture. (They can be
grilled a couple of hours ahead and kept at room temperature.)</TE>
<TE>   To serve, mound each in separate groups on large platter. Garnish
the platter with lime wedges and herb sprigs.</TE>

<HD>The Banana Man: A Comeback Story</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KARP</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone who has taken the scenic drive along the 101 Freeway just
north of Ventura couldn't miss them: rows and rows of lush banana
plants hung thick with fruit. It was as though a bit of South America
had come seaside in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Doug Richardson's small banana plantation was the only substantial
planting in California--and they weren't just any bananas. He sold 50
exotic varieties at his roadside stand and farmers markets, from the
green-and-white striped Ae Ae to the red-blotched Zebrina. Richardson
was California's banana guru, sought out by tourists, journalists and
banana connoisseurs. But then came a mudslide in 1995, which wiped
out the back of his farm. By 1999, Seaside Banana Gardens was just a
memory.</LD>
<LD>   If it was a quirk that the operation ever existed, another quirk
has brought it back. Richardson is again selling his exotic bananas,
but this time they're being grown on a private estate owned by banana
sympathizers in Carpinteria. His return is on a much smaller
scale--fewer plants, and no roadside stand. But his followers are
rejoicing as they discover Richardson is back in business.</LD>
<TE>   Compared to bland, uniform supermarket bananas, Richardson's
varieties offer an astonishing range of forms and flavors. For
example, an unripe Ice Cream banana has bizarre silvery blue-green
skin. Ripe, the fruit turns pale yellow and has a lusciously creamy,
snowy white pulp that tastes exceptionally sweet.</TE>
<TE>   Such a banana is a rare treat in the United States: Bananas are
native to Southeast Asia, and 99% of those eaten in this country
(mostly the standard yellow Cavendish types) come from Central and
South America.</TE>
<TE>   Fate intervened a few years ago when Harry and Cricket Wilson
asked Richardson for help landscaping the site for their new home.
The Wilsons--he is a retired investment manager, and she is the
former medical director at Pepperdine University--were having permit
trouble because of high fire risk and danger of landslides.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson was working in landscape design, but still nurturing a
few plants that he'd salvaged after the mudslide and "dreaming of a
new banana planting." His solution to their steep, unstable terrain
was--you guessed it--banana plants.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson came up with a design combining fire protection,
erosion control and specialty farming. For fire protection, he
planted rings of exotic bananas--1,500 of them around the five-acre
property. The plants are 85% water. They may look like trees, but
botanically bananas are perennial herbs that grow new trunks every
year and die back to their roots after they have fruited.</TE>
<TE>   Banana plants have shallow roots, however, so to stabilize the
soil, Richardson planted bands of vetiver, a fast-growing, clumping
grass with roots that rapidly go down 10 feet. Richardson now
oversees the bananas, and together with the Wilsons, sells them at
local stores and by mail order.</TE>
<TE>   While banana plants grow here and there in Southland backyards,
Richardson has found the state's banana belt. In this nearly
frost-free area, sheltered by coastal mountains from northern winds,
Richardson at one time grew some 100,000 banana plants on his 12-acre
farm.</TE>
<TE>   The Wilsons' 1,500 banana plants started producing last summer.
The harvest is year-round but peaks from August to October. Growing
conditions at the new planting are more marginal than at the old
location: The shallow soil is not ideal, and, on the exposed knoll,
high winds rake the plants. Richardson uses wooden stakes to prop up
many of the plants, which range from 6 to 20 feet tall.</TE>
<TE>   "Some varieties, such as Cardaba and Ice Cream, naturally tend to
lean," he said. "All it takes is a heavy bunch and a 40-mph wind and
the plant falls over."</TE>
<TE>   To protect the fruit against wind-scarring, Richardson's workers
tie blue plastic covers over the maturing stalks, with their "hands"
of upward-curving "fingers." When the fruits are almost ripe, with
the top hand showing yellow or light green--a much more advanced
stage than at commercial plantations--they chop down the stalk with a
machete, cut off the bunches and store them in a shed to ripen
further.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson's bananas are denser and thinner than imported
commercial fruit. They develop more slowly, and they're not as large.
But the fruit sugars are more concentrated and they're richer in
flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Having lunch at the Garden Market in Carpinteria recently,
Richardson said his favorite variety is the Brazilian, also known as
Hawaiian Apple, because of its smooth texture, fruity flavor and
ideal balance of sweetness and acidity.</TE>
<TE>   In the patio garden, where the lunch tables are bordered by rare
banana plants for sale, his wife, Lisa, brought out a tasting plate
of cooking bananas, sauteed in a little butter: Cardaba, Kaulau,
Popoulu and Haa Haa. Starchier than dessert bananas, but less so than
plantains, cooking bananas can be eaten fresh but develop more
nuanced flavor when they're heated.</TE>
<TE>   Soon Richardson was heading off to his new job as chairman of the
Environmental Horticulture Department at Santa Barbara City College,
where he'll teach others to farm on the unstable terrain so common in
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Before going, he stopped to savor a Mysore, a rich
strawberry-citrus flavored banana from India with moist, tangy orange
flesh.</TE>
<TE>   "Taste one of these," he said, "and you see why my banana project
is so compelling."</TE>
<TE>   Doug and Lisa Richardson's bananas are $2 a pound at the Garden
Market, 3811 Santa Claus Lane, Carpinteria; (805) 745-5505. Open
Monday to Friday, 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.; weekends, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The
market also takes orders for 5 1/2 pounds of assorted bananas,
delivered by second-day air: $45 in California, $50 elsewhere.</TE>

<HD>Little Auberge on Melrose</HD>
<DH>Bastide could be Southern California's next great
restaurant, when its partners stop fussing and open it</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUSS PARSONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every chef dreams of having a fairy godmother, someone who can wave a
magic wand and magically supply everything needed to make a dream
restaurant come true.</LD>
<LD>   Alain Giraud got one.</LD>
<LD>   His Bastide, one of the most talked about restaurants in Southern
California, should open early next month, barring yet another a
last-minute delay. But before all you chefs start turning back flips
of envy over Giraud's good fortune, there is a lot more to this story
than one person simply wishing and finding someone to make it so.</LD>
<TE>   First of all, Giraud's little restaurant has taken almost three
years to open--more than a year and a half longer than planned. "If
someone told me two years ago that I would still be waiting to open
right now, I never would have believed them," says Giraud.</TE>
<TE>   But then, the restaurant he is getting bears little resemblance to
anything he'd dreamed about. Back then, Giraud had little more than a
name, Bastide, the word for a farmhouse in the south of France where
he was raised. It would be a restaurant of simple, rustic comfort, a
place where crowds of happy people could eat the kind of food he grew
up with.</TE>
<TE>   Then Giraud met his fairy godmother, albeit one who stands 6 feet
4 and swears like a Marine Corps drill instructor.</TE>
<TE>   "I expected to have a lot of investors to please," Giraud says. "I
ended up with just one."</TE>
<TE>   But what a one. Joe Pytka is a director of television commercials,
legendary in that world both for his abilities and his uncompromising
personal style. More to the point, he is wealthy enough to take
Giraud's rough ideas and turn them into reality--at least, a version
of it.</TE>
<TE>   Today Giraud's humble dream is a gorgeous $3.5 million
high-fashion jewel box seating no more than 80 diners (and in the
wrong weather, with the patios closed, less than half that). It was
decorated by Andree Putman, one of the most respected designers in
France. The food will be refined, the bright easy-to-love flavors of
Provencal cuisine raised to an artistic plane. Prices will be high as
well, $80 per person for dinner, though lunch will be a more
reasonable $30 to $35.</TE>
<TE>   "My vision of the restaurant has changed a lot, for sure," he
says. "I've had to adjust it to fit with [Pytka's] vision. That's
been a little hard, not to change the spirit but to take it into
another dimension. I really have had to extend myself to make this
work."</TE>
<TE>   Opposites Attract</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to imagine an odder couple than Giraud and Pytka. Giraud
is dark and handsome and, at 43, trending a little toward burly. He's
cooked in Los Angeles for almost 15 years, most of that time as the
No. 2 at the late Citrus, working in the sizable shadow of Michel
Richard.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a couple of years heading the kitchen at Lavande in the
Lowes Santa Monica Beach Hotel, he has never quite achieved star chef
status. What he has earned is the affection of almost everyone on the
restaurant scene.</TE>
<TE>   In a world too often dominated by screamers and petty tyrants,
Giraud is regarded as a genuinely sweet soul.</TE>
<TE>   Pytka, 64, is tall and lean with hard blue eyes and
shoulder-length pewter gray hair that he wears swept straight back.
He has the hawk-like visage of Geronimo, and the demeanor to match.</TE>
<TE>   Among the more than 25,000 commercials he's directed are the "Hare
Jordan" spots for Nike that featured Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny
and were spun off into the 1996 movie "Space Jam," which Pytka also
directed. His company, simply called Pytka, is reported to earn $30
to $35 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last decade or so a fair chunk of that has been spent in
restaurants, where he has become a client both adored and feared. On
the one hand, an impromptu dinner for a few friends with some great
wines might mean a $10,000 windfall for some lucky restaurant. At the
same time, a misstep--however slight--might mean a tongue-lashing
that could strip paint.</TE>
<TE>   One morning when Bastide sommelier Christophe Rolland shows up for
work nattily dressed in a suit and matching taupe shirt, Pytka, who
is wearing his customary T-shirt and jeans, lays into him with a
machine-gun barrage without so much as saying "Hello."</TE>
<TE>   "What are you wearing that shirt for? ... I never want to see a
shirt like that in this place ....That color is totally
inappropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Rolland, who has worked for the three-star Auberge de l'Ill in
France, is small and tightly wound. At first he seems to think Pytka
is joking and smiles, then he blanches when he comes to the
conclusion that he's not.</TE>
<TE>   Just when you think Rolland might break into tears, Pytka smiles,
claps him on the shoulder and changes the subject, talking about how
a restaurant he'd been to the night before had had the same problems
they'd had in getting a certain vintage of the cult Bordeaux Le Pin.</TE>
<TE>   So well known is Pytka's temper that at one point there was an
informal betting pool among Southern California chefs as to how long
his and Giraud's partnership would last. Of course, they would only
say so in whispers--a $10,000 dinner is not to be gambled on.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of people warning me about being involved with
him, and sometimes it has been difficult," Giraud concedes. "But what
Joe does is push you to be your best. He doesn't accept mediocrity
and he doesn't accept any compromises."</TE>
<TE>   Giraud and Pytka met because their daughters attend the same
French private school (Pytka's wife is French). At first, Pytka was
thinking about buying the Venice hot spot 72 Market Street, which is
near his office. He asked Giraud for advice.</TE>
<TE>   "He took a look at it and took a look at the numbers and advised
against it," Pytka says. "But we had talked some by then and realized
we shared a lot of the same ideas."</TE>
<TE>   The First False Alarm</TE>
<TE>   This was back in the fall of 1999. In the beginning, Bastide was
supposed to be open and serving dinner by early 2001. In fact,
restaurant critic John Mariani announced the restaurant's opening in
Wine Spectator magazine that April--more than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of the delay was due to the endless process of permitting
and construction. But a lot of it was also due to Pytka's quest for
perfection. If something wasn't done just right, the only thing to do
was start over--just spend the time and money to get it right.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like you've got a house of cards and every time you've got
them stacked, someone pulls one out and the whole thing comes down,"
says Pytka.</TE>
<TE>   While he fends off the notion that he is anything more than a
passive investor--and while that may have been his original
intention--there is no question that he is now fully committed. Few
silent partners insist on having final say in the hiring of the wait
staff.</TE>
<TE>   "Me getting involved was not a conscious act," he says. "It was
like quicksand. I'm not interested in running a restaurant in any way
shape or form. I'm only interested in it so far as having a nice
place to eat and wanting to control my environment as much as
possible without being a pest."</TE>
<TE>   While Pytka speaks admiringly of Los Angeles' restaurant scene in
general, he says there was something missing.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a lot of great restaurants here, but one thing I
thought Los Angeles needed was a grown-up restaurant that wasn't
stuffy. Some place that was a little adventurous but was warm. I use
the restaurant Arpege in Paris as my example of a place like that.
They serve a more modern concept of French food, but it's not a cold
place at all."</TE>
<TE>   Giraud's first clue as to how Pytka worked came when he drew up
the initial proposal for Bastide. Giraud scoured West Los Angeles for
available restaurant sites and drew up a dossier listing each with
its advantages and disadvantages.</TE>
<TE>   Then he took it to Pytka, who tossed it aside, looked him in the
eye and asked, "Which one is the best?" When Giraud made his choice,
Pytka went out and got it, no questions asked.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out to be a place that both of them knew. The building
had originally been Le Restaurant and later the Manhattan Won Ton
Company.</TE>
<TE>   When Giraud first came to Los Angeles, his wife had gone to a
salon in the neighborhood and he says he remembers waiting for her
one day, looking at the building and dreaming that one day he would
have a restaurant of his own that nice.</TE>
<TE>   Pytka had eaten there often when it was Le Restaurant. He
remembers walking past it in its Won Ton incarnation and telling a
friend: "You wouldn't believe it, but at one time that was the
coolest, most romantic, sexiest restaurant in Los Angeles. Even with
that stupid name it is still beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Bastide is even more gorgeous today, so perfect it practically
shimmers. That is thanks mainly to the work of Putman, who not only
created the general look of the place but designed much of the
furniture as well.</TE>
<TE>   A thin, elegant older woman, Putman is well known in France for
her clean style, which is modern yet natural, as well as for her
definite opinions.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason so many restaurants are so ugly is that so many chefs
are so bourgeois," she says. "All they think about is impressing you
with how important they are. I hate design that tries to intimidate
or to impress. When someone does that, what it means is they want the
power for themselves, not for the people they are serving."</TE>
<TE>   She and Pytka go back 20 years, to when he walked into her Paris
atelier and began telling her about a piece of Eileen Gray furniture
he'd bought.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked him where he had it and he told me against the wall," she
remembers. "I told him he needed to move it away from the wall. That
piece needed to float with space around it so it could breathe. He
laughed and told me I needed to come to Los Angeles and organize his
house. So I did."</TE>
<TE>   Putman, Pytka says simply, "is one of those people who can take
you to the next level."</TE>
<TE>   Bastide is her version of a Provencal country house, filtered
through a very particular design sensibility, with the sometimes
garish colors made chromatic and all of the accidental details
perfectly in place.</TE>
<TE>   You can say the same about Giraud's menu. As he puts it, he's
looking for "simple ingredients done in a very elegant way." Take for
example, the traditional appetizer of melons served with sweet
Beaumes de Venise wine.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually, you just cut the melon in half and marinate the inside
in the wine," he says. "But I wanted to make it a little different."
After playing with making a terrine of melon and wine, he turned in
another direction.</TE>
<TE>   "I had the idea of putting a very light gelee on the bottom of the
plate, and a thin slice of melon cut in a rectangle on top. I still
needed something to make it a little special. So I thought about
rolling the melon into something like a cannelloni. Why not add some
crab?</TE>
<TE>   "So I made a light crab salad with just a little bit of mayonnaise
and rolled that in the thin slice of melon and set it on a light
gelee of Beaumes de Venise and tart melon juice. I put a little
microgreens on top, something for crispness.</TE>
<TE>   "There, that is a dish for summer."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, though the restaurant at this point has yet to serve
anything beyond small private parties, if the early samples of the
food Giraud and his team are producing are any indication of what is
to come, Bastide should lift him into the star chef category.</TE>
<TE>   The food is bright and colorful but polished. Dishes on the summer
menu are bursting with the sun-drenched flavor of Provence, yet they
have a refinement that no one would mistake for rustic.</TE>
<TE>   A dish of monkfish roasted and served on a bed of vegetables comes
with a reduced vinegar sauce that might seem at first too acidic, but
is in perfect balance when eaten with the fish and the diced pancetta
it's served with.</TE>
<TE>   The same delicate balancing act takes place in a dessert that
pairs a sorbet of orange and basil with fresh berries in a sauce of
orange juice and Beaumes de Venise. Handled less carefully, the sauce
could taste alcoholic; here it sets off the berries and sorbet
stunningly.</TE>
<TE>   The Wine War</TE>
<TE>   While Pytka let Giraud pretty much have his way with the menu,
wine was another matter. Pytka is an avid collector with definite
tastes. The list at Bastide will be entirely French, much to Giraud's
consternation.</TE>
<TE>   "We discussed the list a lot, then we argued about it, then we
fought about it," says Pytka. The problem was that the restaurant had
limited storage and after Pytka had stocked the wines he wanted most,
there was no room left.</TE>
<TE>   "The only option was to have some token wines from California and
Italy for political reasons, and I thought that was disrespectful to
them," he says. "Plus, you can go to every other restaurant in town
and get those wines."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Giraud conceded that battle and now says simply "That
is something I would never have had the courage to do."</TE>
<TE>   This, in a nutshell, is the story of the two personalities. On the
one hand you have Giraud, raised in a careful French restaurant
family where, he says, "You start modest, then when you make some
money you slowly improve. I come from a world where you make one
dollar and you put away 50 cents."</TE>
<TE>   And on the other there's Pytka, who has succeeded by swinging for
every fence he's ever seen. "My philosophy is, if we do the right
thing, it will be a success. If we're not, there's something wrong."</TE>
<TE>   In part this kind of talk inspires Giraud. On the other hand, you
get the feeling that when he hears Pytka say things like "If we're
going to fail, let's fail for the right reasons," it also scares him.
Though Pytka certainly acknowledges how much Giraud has on the line,
he also has his millions to fall back on if the deal craters.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm feeling is a combination of excitement and
apprehension," Giraud says. "It's not like I'm 18 and opening some
bistro for $1,000 with a couple of friends and we're going to serve
roast chicken."</TE>
<TE>   All he can do now is get the place open and see what happens. But
first he's got to convince his partner to make that giant step. At
this point, Pytka is still restricting the staff to what seems like
an endless series of rehearsals--private dinner parties for himself
and a dozen or so friends.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is going well," says Giraud, "but it's like going out
and singing one song when you're ready to do a full concert."</TE>
<TE>   By now, Giraud has learned to be philosophical. He knows Bastide
will open eventually, even though he can't say exactly when. At the
beginning of the month, it was supposed to be this week. As recently
as Friday, it was supposed to be by Sept. 11. On Tuesday, Giraud was
"confident" the restaurant would be open on Sept. 16."Joe always
wants to fix one more thing, to make it exactly right before he lets
anybody in," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I was talking to him the other day and I told him this is just
like raising our little girls. They're growing up and at one point,
you know they're going to have to go on a date alone. You don't want
them to--you're afraid for what might happen--but you know they will.
You just have to hope you've done your best and let them go."</TE>

<TE>   Roasted Monkfish With Herbed Vegetable Ragout</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 45 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   Bastide uses an unusual cut of monkfish for this recipe, which
needs to be special-ordered through fish markets such as Los Angeles
Fish Co. at (213) 629-1213. You can also use monkfish filets. Baby
carrots are sold at farmers markets and can often be special-ordered
from gourmet markets.</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 pounds middle cut bone-in monkfish, skin removed, or filets</TE>
<TE>   4 yellow baby squash</TE>
<TE>   4 green baby squash</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   2 yellow and 2 orange baby carrots, peeled, greens removed</TE>
<TE>   4 spears asparagus, peeled, bottoms removed</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup haricots verts, tips removed</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   Pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 ounces pancetta, diced fine</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup Sherry vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon finely chopped Italian parsley</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon finely chopped fresh marjoram</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup chicken stock</TE>
<TE>   Remove the thin membrane surrounding the monkfish with a sharp
knife. Set the fish aside.</TE>
<TE>   Cook the yellow and green squash in rapidly boiling salted water
until tender, about 5 minutes. Cool in a bowl of ice water. Drain and
set aside. Repeat this process with each of the remaining vegetables
(the carrots will take 4 to 5 minutes, the asparagus and haricots
verts 2 minutes).</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 400 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Heat an ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil.
Season the fish with salt and pepper. When the oil is hot, sear the
fish on all sides, about 3 minutes a side. Place the skillet in the
oven and bake until the fish flakes with a fork and is cooked
through, 15 to 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the fish from the skillet, reserving the juices. To make
the sauce, add the pancetta and Sherry vinegar to the skillet, and
cook over medium heat until the liquid is reduced by half, about 2
minutes. Add the chicken stock.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate pan, reheat the remaining vegetables. Add the
parsley, thyme and marjoram and salt and pepper to taste.</TE>
<TE>   Present the roasted monkfish in a nice cooking pan or on a
platter, garnished with the vegetables and the sauce. To serve, carve
the fish along each side of the bone running down the middle.</TE>

<HD>The Espresso Connection</HD>
<DH>Secrets to the perfect cup overflow online, with endless
refills from caffeine die-hards</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUSS PARSONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It all started when my department store espresso machine finally gave
up the ghost a couple of months ago. To tell the truth, though our
relationship was of long standing, it had not been particularly
happy--at least from my point of view--for the last few years. I had
outgrown her. The parting was tough, but it was time to move on.</LD>
<LD>   Like almost everyone these days, when faced with an important life
decision, I immediately fired up my computer and visited Google. Thus
began my trip down Alice's rabbit hole into the unholy conjunction of
cyberspace and caffeine, a virtual world fraught with passion,
obsession and performance anxiety.</LD>
<LD>   It's a land where I learned about 25-second pulls, custom-made
titanium tampers and the intricacies of back-flushing. It's a land
where I quickly acquired a $400 espresso machine and a $10-a-week
bean habit. And it's a land where most of the inhabitants will scoff
at such paltry amounts.</LD>
<TE>   My first clue that I was stumbling into deep water came when I
typed "espresso" in the search engine and hit return. More than 1.1
million sites. Refining it to "espresso machine" narrowed it to
100,000. And "home espresso machine" resulted in 68,000. Obviously,
this is a topic that many people on the Internet feel very strongly
about.</TE>
<TE>   Among the places I found were commercial sites for both
manufacturers and sellers, as well as vendors of everything from
coffee beans to grinders to tampers--the little stamp you use to
compress the ground coffee into a tight disc. The amount of equipment
you can buy to outfit a home espresso bar is astonishing.</TE>
<TE>   The two most popular seem to be those belonging to 1st-Line
Equipment and Whole Latte Love. Both are small companies with
excellent reputations for equipment, service and support. Which to
choose seems to be mainly a matter of taste; they carry essentially
identical lines at essentially identical prices. (I ended up going
with Whole Latte Love because I liked the name.)</TE>
<TE>   These are not the places to buy your run-of-the-mill coffee maker.
This is the land of Gaggia, Rancilio, Saeco and Pavoni, the Italian
sports cars of the coffee world. The difference between these
machines and a Mr. Coffee is the difference between an audiophile
stereo system and a portable cassette player. At their best, these
machines yield coffee with rich, creamy texture and unbelievably
focused and detailed flavor. The critical crema--the layer of
emulsified oil and water that floats to the top of a good cup--is at
least  1/4 inch thick and cocoa brown, not white.</TE>
<TE>   These machines are also every bit as temperamental as your old
Alfa. Forget about pushing a button and coffee coming out. This is
coffee-making as ritual.</TE>
<TE>   First you have to preheat the machine, starting it up about a
half-hour before you're ready to use it. Turn on the steam valve to
clear any water left over. Run hot water through the machine to warm
the filter basket and the cups. Grind the coffee to just the right
fineness, then dispense it into the filter basket. Tamp it just right
(between 20 and 30 pounds per square inch is deemed perfect--people
practice on a bathroom scale to get it exact). Fit the filter basket
into the machine and now you're ready to push the button.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, dispense with the "puck" (and pray that it's dry and
tight, not sloppy) and run some water through the filter head to get
rid of any loose grind. Every couple of weeks you need to do a
thorough cleaning, breaking the machine down and soaking the various
parts in a special solvent to get rid of any oily buildup.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, these are not machines for the masses but for the hardy
few, the caffeinated lunatic fringe. Not surprisingly, then, there
are also a good number of espresso fan sites--noncommercial Web sites
built by people motivated simply by the love of caffeine. Many of
these are quite technically sophisticated, as good as or better than
many a commercial site.</TE>
<TE>   One of my favorites is Randy Glass' "Espresso! My Espresso!" page,
which he calls an "ongoing Internet novelette." Currently 56
chapters, it begins with his apparently spontaneous decision to
explore the world of espresso. As novelettes frequently do, it has
its roots in childhood trauma--not being allowed to share Mom and
Dad's morning brew (paging Dr. Freud, stat!).</TE>
<TE>   After 17 chapters of research and pondering, the machine
eventually arrives--well, the machines. It seems our previously
decaffeinated hero has become sufficiently consumed to order not just
an espresso machine but also a grinder and--the thing that separates
the men from the boys--a home roaster. The story goes on from there.</TE>
<TE>   One of the best things on this site is a close-up video of an
espresso shot being pulled from his new machine. As with the
novelette, it's not the plot that appeals so much as the technique.
Lacking a digital video camera, Glass assembled this moving picture
by splicing together still images--roughly one frame for every 1/4
second of the 23-second pull. It is set up on a loop so it repeats
indefinitely. In cyberspace, the espresso never stops.</TE>
<TE>   Another of my favorite sites is run by David Schomer, owner of
Seattle's Espresso Vivace coffee bars. Schomer, who wears a certain
wired/quizzical terrier look in the picture on the site, is the
philosopher king of espresso, and his tips are intended mainly for
professionals.</TE>
<TE>   His analysis of the factors of a perfect espresso starts with the
environmental (temperature, direct sunlight and humidity). The
perfect espresso, he believes, can only be brewed at precisely 203
degrees (measured, he recommends, with a "Fluke 51 K/J readout fitted
with an iron-constant low mass bead probe").</TE>
<TE>   The degree of specificity in an espresso discussion is not to be
underestimated. For proof, visit the newsgroup alt.coffee, which
truly is where the wild things are.</TE>
<TE>   A newsgroup is a place where people who share an interest in a
topic can meet to discuss their opinions and concerns. Alt.coffee is
evenly split between the two. You can state your position on the
issue of whether a convex 58-millimeter tamper is inherently superior
to the flat one in combination with a La Marzocco double filter
basket and, if so, whether it is really worth it to go for the
hand-carved Reg Barber special ($40 and up).</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, if you're troubled by "short pulls" (espresso
shots that take less than the ideal 25 seconds ... apparently an
affliction that affects millions), alt.coffee is the place to go to
find a sympathetic ear. Even though passions do run high on this
board, it is a remarkably friendly and helpful place (especially
compared with boards discussing, say, operating system software).</TE>
<TE>   People will write in about various espresso-related experiences.
One poster confided that when he visited Seattle, he phoned ahead to
ask when he could have Schomer personally pull him an espresso.
Another was titled "Trip to Montana Yielded Great Espresso Shot."
These are people who plan vacations around a cup of coffee.</TE>
<TE>   They'll also share tips and tinkers: A common one is how to
install a digital thermostat in your coffee machine to hit that
perfect 203-degree temperature.</TE>
<TE>   When I was troubled by an espresso-related problem (yes, for a
brief time I suffered from short-pull syndrome; all better now), the
group not only diagnosed it for me (worn grinder blades) but told me
where to buy replacements and walked me through the procedure of
installing them--and I'm a guy whose idea of an advanced handyman
project is hanging a picture.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, from visiting the newsgroup almost daily for several
months (like a good cappuccino, it quickly becomes a morning ritual),
what I find most amazing is how patiently the same core group of
experts deals with what seems like an endless repetition of the same
dozen or so questions.</TE>
<TE>   And that occasionally includes the ultimate Internet conversation
killer: "After spending $1,000 on a machine, $250 on a grinder and
$20 a pound on beans, how come I still get better espresso at the
stand at the Rome airport?"</TE>
<TE>   Russ Parsons makes his morning latte on a Rancilio Silvia machine
and a rebuilt Gaggia MDF grinder, using Malabar Gold beans from
Josuma Coffee Co.</TE>

<LD>We thought we knew banana cream pie, until we tasted Suzanne Tracht's
revival of the classic at Jar.</LD>
<LD>   Tracht, who is head chef and co-owner of that purposefully
American restaurant on Beverly Boulevard, manages to preserve the
indulgence of the dessert, while imparting a remarkable elegance and
lightness to it.</LD>
<LD>   Bananas are not left to sulk in pastry cream but set in a mixture
of creme anglaise lightened at the last moment by the addition of
whipped cream. The filling makes a luxurious complement to slices of
sweet banana and a perfectly crisp crust. A squirt of caramel
finishes the business like a dark sweet remark.</LD>

<TE>   Jar's Banana Cream Pie</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 1 hour, 15 minutes, plus 4
hours chilling</TE>
<TE>   PASTRY DOUGH</TE>
<TE>   2 1/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons flour, plus more for rolling</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 cup (2 sticks) butter, cubed and chilled, plus more for
preparing pans</TE>
<TE>   4 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   4 to 5 tablespoons whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   Nonstick cooking spray</TE>
<TE>   Combine the flour and sugar in a food processor or mixer. With the
machine running, slowly add the butter, and process or mix until you
have a fine meal. Mix together the yolks and the cream, and slowly
add it into the flour mixture. Process until the dough just starts to
come together.</TE>
<TE>   Turn the dough onto a floured work surface; workwith the heel of
your palm until it comes together flat and smooth. Form the dough
into 8 small disks. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Butter 8 (4-inch) tart pans. (If you only have 4 pans, you can
make 4 shells at a time.) Roll the disks out to 1/8 inch thick. Form
the dough into the tart pans. Use a rolling pan to roll over the tops
of the pans until the excess dough drops from the sides. Press the
dough gently to the sides of the pans. You must chill and weigh down
the dough. The easiest way is by spraying a coffee filter with
cooking spray and filling it with dried beans, then placing it on top
of the pastry dough. Chill the shells for at least another 2 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 400 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Bake the shells (coffee-filter bags and beans still on top) until
they become light amber, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the coffee filters
and let the shells cool to room temperature. Carefully remove the
shells from the pans.</TE>
<TE>   PASTRY CREAM</TE>
<TE>   7 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons cornstarch</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons flour</TE>
<TE>   2 cups whole milk</TE>
<TE>   1 vanilla bean</TE>
<TE>   Beat the egg yolks and sugar until the mixture is pale and forms
ribbons when the beaters are lifted from the bowl. Sift in the
cornstarch and flour, mixing well.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the milk in a saucepan over medium heat. Split and scrape the
vanilla bean and place in the milk. Once the milk comes to a boil,
remove the bean, then slowly whisk about 1/4 of the milk into the egg
mixture, then whisk rapidly to incorporate and not curdle the eggs.
Return the mixture to the milk in the saucepan. Cook over medium-low
heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture becomes thick and
bubbles, 6 to 8 minutes. Cover the cream with plastic wrap, pressing
it flat across the cream's surface so no skin forms, and refrigerate
1 hour.</TE>
<TE>   CARAMEL SAUCE</TE>
<TE>   1 cup whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter</TE>
<TE>   1 vanilla bean, split and scraped</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup light corn syrup</TE>
<TE>   2 cups sugar</TE>
<TE>   Place the cream, butter and vanilla bean in a saucepan over low
heat until the butter melts. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the corn syrup in a deep, heavy saucepan over medium-high
heat until it just starts to bubble, about 3 minutes, then slowly
sprinkle in the sugar, stirring with a wooden spoon. Once the sugar
has been incorporated, stir a bit slower, allowing the mix to become
a very light amber, then straw-colored, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove
from the heat.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the bean from the cream mixture and discard; add the cream
mixture to the corn syrup mixture, being careful not to burn yourself
from the splattering. Return the sauce to high heat and cook until
the sugar completely dissolves, 2 to 3 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Pour the sauce into a heat-proof container, stirring once or twice
over the next 5 minutes to prevent further cooking.</TE>
<TE>   ASSEMBLY</TE>
<TE>   Pastry Cream</TE>
<TE>   Pie shells</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup whipping cream, whipped to soft peaks, divided</TE>
<TE>   4 ripe bananas, sliced 1/4-inch thick</TE>
<TE>   Caramel Sauce</TE>
<TE>   Place about 1 tablespoon of the Pastry Cream in the bottom of each
shell. In a large mixing bowl, fold the remaining Pastry Cream in
with 3/4 of the whipped cream. Gently fold in the bananas. Fill each
shell just to the top. Place a large dollop of the whipped cream on
top to cover.</TE>
<TE>   Place the Caramel Sauce in a squeeze bottle, or use a metal spoon
to make a zig-zag of sauce across each plate. Place the pies on top.
Drizzle or squeeze the sauce in a zig-zag on top of each pie.</TE>

<HD>Nice Try, Chef Says, but Test Burger Doesn't Cut the

<LD>Thanks for the nice mention ("Introducing the Glam Burger," Aug. 21).
The recipe by your test kitchen made me laugh. Not because it was
ridiculous, but because you would try to re-create it. I'm flattered.
As for the recipe you published, a good but somewhat hasty attempt.
Ketchup and liquid smoke? No way!</LD>
<LD>   I'm sure your version was great, however the one angle of approach
missing is technique. The secrets of my compote are timing and
patience during the cooking process. My experience in top kitchens
showed me the importance of extracting intense flavors from basic
ingredients. I created my burger mindful of my lessons. I think a lot
of upper-echelon chefs are letting their guard down and having some
fun. Utilizing a chef's talents on basic foods is something I'm happy
to see happening.</LD>
<LD>   Having said this, I would have loved trying your version. If you
really want the details, I'll tell you someday over a beer.</LD>

<TE>   Enticed by the description of the deconstruction of the Office
Burger, I had to rush home and try it. I followed the directions to a
"T" and found it to be ... strange-tasting. The beef was delicious
but the topping was just weird. I guess one has a boatload of
expectations to overcome when it comes to experimenting with that old
standby, and I'm reminded of a quote by James Beard (I think), who
said, "Anyone who doesn't think the best burgers are to be found in
his own hometown is a ninny." I think Pie n' Burger in Pasadena makes
the best cheeseburger in the world!</TE>

<TE>   The burgers mentioned are a monument to gluttony. Have you ever
tried to eat one of these monstrosities? The meat is at least an inch
thick ... so you have a construction at least 5 inches high. What are
they thinking? The last time I was served one of these things I
proceeded to dismantle the contents and reorganize the pieces on my
plate so that I could use a knife and fork. When will restaurant
owners serve food that can be eaten in polite company without having
it all run down your face?</TE>

<LD>Sometimes the appetizers at a party can be a pitfall. Though small in
size, the wedges of cheese, bowls of nuts and cream-cheese-laced
bites of food can be high in calories. And you keep nibbling, because
small bites are so easy.</LD>
<LD>   These chicken skewers pack a lot of flavor, so you only need one.
Marinated in light coconut milk and herbs, they're then grilled and
served with a sauce that uses a small amount of light coconut milk
(found in the Asian aisle of well-stocked supermarkets.)</LD>
<LD>   For something different, thread the chicken tenders on lemon grass
sticks for grilling. Offer them alongside fresh vegetable sticks such
as jicama, or a colorful array of pepper strips.</LD>

<TE>   Coconut Chicken Skewers</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 30 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 40 minutes
plus 8 hours marinating</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups light coconut milk, divided</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons fish sauce</TE>
<TE>   2 cloves garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon curry powder</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint, divided</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons chopped cilantro, divided</TE>
<TE>   6 stalks lemon grass</TE>
<TE>   1 pound boneless, skinless chicken tenders (about 12 pieces)</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon chopped peanuts</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon light brown sugar</TE>
<TE>   Dried red pepper flakes</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Fresh mint leaves, slices of lime, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   Combine 1 cup of the coconut milk, the fish sauce, half the
garlic, the curry powder, 1 tablespoon chopped mint and 1 tablespoon
chopped cilantro in a bowl. Cut the bottom third off the lemon grass
stalks and smash them with a cleaver, then coarsely chop. Add to the
coconut mixture. Add the chicken, stirring to coat all sides. Cover
and let marinate in the refrigerator overnight.</TE>
<TE>   Cut the remaining 6 lemon grass pieces in half crosswise, then in
half lengthwise to make 12 sticks. Cut one end of the sticks into a
point to make threading the chicken easier. Wrap the sticks in
plastic wrap until ready to use.</TE>
<TE>   For the dipping sauce, combine the remaining 1/2 cup of coconut
milk, the remaining garlic, the chopped peanuts, brown sugar, a dash
of red pepper flakes, the salt and remaining 1 tablespoon each of
cilantro and mint.</TE>
<TE>   Heat a well-seasoned outdoor grill to high or a stove-top grill
pan over high heat.</TE>
<TE>   Thread one piece of chicken on each lemon grass skewer. Grill the
skewers until cooked through and charred in spots, about 3 to 4
minutes per side. Serve the skewers arranged on a platter with mint
leaves and lime slices. Serve the dipping sauce alongside the
skewers.</TE>

<LD>One of my favorite brunch recipes is for old-fashioned Dutch Baby.
Topped with a mixture of summer berries--blackberries, blueberries
and raspberries--and garnished with a dollop of sweetened whipped
cream, this puffed pancake will delight any guest.</LD>
<LD>   When pulled from the oven, it looks impressive. But it's easy to
make. Just be sure to use a heated cast-iron skillet and to serve
immediately--it will deflate as it stands.</LD>
<LD>   Breakfast sausages are the perfect accompaniment. Mix up some
cooling summer drinks or serve orange juice on the rocks, and have
the hot coffee ready.</LD>

<TE>   Dutch Baby With Assorted Berries</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   1 cup milk</TE>
<TE>   6 eggs</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   1 cup flour</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons granulated sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup unsalted butter</TE>
<TE>   12 sausage links</TE>
<TE>   1 cup whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup powdered sugar, divided</TE>
<TE>   3 cups assorted berries, such as blackberries, blueberries,
raspberries</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Place a well-seasoned heavy
cast-iron skillet in the oven to heat.</TE>
<TE>   Beat the milk, eggs and vanilla in a mixing bowl until thoroughly
mixed. Add the flour, granulated sugar and the salt slowly and
continue to beat until light and smooth.</TE>
<TE>   Add the butter to the skillet and return it to the oven briefly,
just until the butter has melted. Remove the skillet and quickly
swirl the butter to coat the bottom and sides. Pour in the batter.
Return the skillet to the oven and bake until golden brown, 18 to 20
minutes. Do not open the oven while the Dutch Baby is baking, as it
may deflate.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, cook the sausages over dium heat until nicely browned
and cooked through, 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Whip the cream in a small bowl and fold in 1 tablespoon of the
powdered sugar. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   When the Dutch Baby is done, remove from the oven and fill the
center cavity with the berries. Dust with the remaining powdered
sugar, cut into wedges, and serve immediately. Pass the whipped cream
as a garnish. Serve the sausages on the side.</TE>

<LD>DEAR SOS: This is an urgent request for the recipe for Chocolate
Malted Milk Cake and icing that you published in the 1990s. I have
moved back to Canada, and I dream of this cake all the time.</LD>
<LD>   PAT BAYES</LD>
<LD>   Vancouver, B.C.</LD>
<TE>   DEAR PAT: This recipe calls for sour milk, or clabber, made by
combining the milk and cider vinegar. Pasteurized milk does not
clabber the way unpasteurized milk naturally would. But a modern
version of sour milk can be made by adding 1 tablespoon vinegar or
lemon juice to 1 cup of milk. (This works too as a substitute for

self-basting spikes on the underside of the lid. As moisture
condenses on the spikes, it drips down, basting the dish. We made a
stew in the pot, and found that the beef browned well and the stew
cooked evenly, with no hot spots. Serve your dish directly from the

<HD>From Tuscany, Sangiovese Like Never Before</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROD SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been barely a decade since the Tuscan wine community began to
reinvent itself. In a remarkable show of collective resolve, the
group of passionate individualists known as Italians came together to
upgrade their wineries while replanting their vineyards to best
express the Tuscan treasure, Sangiovese.</LD>
<LD>   Virtually overnight--on viticulture's slo-mo time scale--one of
the world's oldest and most traditional wine regions became one of
the newest and hippest. And by happy coincidence, the first results
of the make-over came during a string of superb growing seasons from
1997 to 2001.</LD>
<LD>   In other words, the best Sangiovese-based wines in history are now
landing on our shores. Just the color of these wines is enough to
whet the appetite--and then you raise the glass.</LD>
<TE>   An outstanding red wine should have an inviting aroma with more
complexity than just the smell of ripe grapes and wood; a stimulating
tannic texture within overall smoothness; a harmonious impression in
the mouth; fine balance leaning slightly toward acidity; and a long,
clean aftertaste that repeats the foregoing impressions in a more
ethereal form, like a dream.</TE>
<TE>   That could generally describe any number of reds from the world's
foremost wine regions. But get a little more specific in some of the
sensory elements--for example, mingle the scent of violets into the
perfume and plug sour-cherry candy and a hint of licorice into the
fruit section--and it's a pretty good description of Sangiovese.</TE>
<TE>   The outstanding Tuscan Sangioveses come primarily from three
zones, each with its own distinctive qualities. Chianti Classico is
the classical Sangiovese area between Florence and Siena.
Montepulciano is the center of another area in the mountains
southeast of Siena. And the warm, dry slopes surrounding Montalcino,
south of Siena in the rain-shadow of Mt. Amiata, are home to the
biggest, longest-lived Sangioveses.</TE>
<TE>   The Chianti Classico producers now are showing off wonderful 2000s
and '99 Riservas, most in the $12-to-$25 range, including many sleek
beauties with polished tannins, succulent flavors and wonderful
wood-violet and rose petal perfumes.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, those are my specific tasting notes for the Badia a
Coltibuono Riserva '99, but it's a good picture of what to expect
from any number of other '99s, such as Canonica a Cerreto, Castello
di Fonterutoli, Castello di Verrazzano, Melini and Tenuta di
Bibbiano.</TE>
<TE>   The ancient hilltop fortress of Montepulciano is offering 2000
Rossos and '99 Vino Nobiles, and they are exceptional values--few
exceed $25. The local name for Sangiovese in the vineyards around
Montepulciano is Prugnolo. A decade of viticultural research in
Tuscany has revealed that Prognolo is a distinct clone of Sangiovese
that yields characteristic wines, just as the Brunello clone of
Sangiovese does in the Montalcino vineyards. (Confusion control note:
Another Tuscan wine called Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is unrelated; it's
made from a grape called Montepulciano around the village of Abruzzo.
Go figure.)</TE>
<TE>   These wines are more rustic than Chianti Classicos, and that's a
good thing. The altitude and dry climate of Montepulciano produce
riper Sangioveses that show more of a dried-fruit character,
concentrated in the black cherry, blackberry and licorice realm.
Sometimes there's a smoky, leathery undertone, too, which is a
perfect foil for barbecue flavors.</TE>
<TE>   Best of all is the sensuous tannin. Slightly rough without being
abrasive, it gently scours the palate of rich flavors such as olive
oil and leaves it fresh for the next bite.</TE>
<TE>   Look for Rossos such as La Calonica, Vecchia Cantina, Le Casalte
and La Braccesca. But seek out '99 Vino Nobiles, too.</TE>
<TE>   Poliziano, for example, has amazing color and flavor, richness and
elegance. Also impressive are La Calonica, La Ciarliana, Poderi
Boscarelli and Canneto (if you like oak, this silky beauty is for
you).</TE>
<TE>   Red-wine fans love Rosso di Montalcino, the younger version of
Brunello. And the 2000 Rossos are fantastic. For all their
lip-smacking slurpiness, they have plenty of structure and nearly
chewable tannins. Banfi is a good example: Bright-red, packed with
sunny fruit and firm on the palate, it's like a super-Beaujolais.
(Note to self: Buy several cases, serve with pizza.)</TE>
<TE>   The big revelation is the ravishing beauty of the '97 Brunello di
Montalcinos, as a group the best Brunellos ever. These are the most
regal Sangioveses that Tuscany has to offer. The warm climate and
tannic Brunello clones conspire to produce powerful wines that
require longer aging before release. As a group, these are worth the
wait (and, arguably, worth a price tag typically exceeding $50 a
bottle).</TE>
<TE>   Tenuta di Sesta, for example. This astonishing Brunello is one of
the wines I'm sometimes tempted to describe with such anthropomorphic
terms as "insouciant," or even "insolent." The wine has a
personality, and it's definitely my type. It's not just deep and
powerful, but rolls through the mouth like a convoy of Ferraris at
cruising speed.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Donatella Cinelli Colombini's remarkable Prime Donne,
a proprietary bottling by one of the most dynamic women in the
Italian wine world. In fact, her entire team, from cellar to
marketing, is made up of women. The Colombini Brunello '97 is truly
majestic in the depth of its dark, clear flavors and sensual tannins.</TE>
<TE>   And let us not neglect the rapidly expanding class of
Sangiovese-based blends that incorporates nontraditional grapes. It
includes some of the most expensive Tuscan wines, such as Antinori's
Tignanello, a New World-ish blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon,
and Cabernet Franc.</TE>
<TE>   But you don't have to spend a bundle. Look for scrumptious 2000s
for around $10 such as Antinori's Santa Cristina, a lovely
Sangiovese-Merlot blend produced at the same estate as Tignanello,
and Capezzana Conti Contini, entirely Sangiovese and entirely tasty.</TE>

Ranch."</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's a racy young Sauvignon Blanc, lean and graceful with a
delicate, lingering finish. It makes a fine aperitif and can easily
segue into dinner, especially if you're serving fish. It goes
especially well with goat cheese, too.</LD>
<LD>   It's a very pure expression of the Sauvignon Blanc grape, possibly
the single best from California I've tasted recently. Fortunately for
us, Farrell is one winemaker who has determinedly kept his head about
prices, so it's also a great buy.</LD>
<LD>   About $18. Available at Beverage Warehouse in Marina del Rey,

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like swallows to Capistrano, threats of a baseball strike and
chrysanthemum blooms, the teen coming-of-age comedy continues to be a
hardy perennial. But we've come a long way from the halcyon days of
Andy Hardy. Gone are the worldly wise father figures and bucolic
suburban settings, only to be replaced by pop references,
profanity-driven dialogue and punch lines heavily reliant on
flatulence and other bodily functions.</LD>
<LD>   But however mindless the mass of teen movies appear, a small yet
notable number of thoughtful, articulate-and still funny-films about
adolescent angst have found their way to cinema screens. These
movies, often produced on relatively minuscule budgets by independent
production companies, offer a refreshing counterpoint to mainstream
studio fare.</LD>
<LD>   In 1999, "Election" won a lot of votes--and an Oscar
nomination--for screenwriters Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor's
lacerating take on high school politicking. "Rushmore" (1998) earned
critical praise for its wry examination of the underbelly of prep
school life. And the protagonist of this summer's "Tadpole" is a
15-year-old who is more comfortable quoting Voltaire than rap lyrics.</LD>
<TE>   The latest entry into the high-literacy teen stakes is "Igby Goes
Down," which opens in Los Angeles and New York on Sept. 13. Written
and directed by rookie filmmaker Burr Steers, "Igby" stars Kieran
Culkin in the title role, the disaffected younger son of a privileged
East Coast family that, while still well connected, is no longer well
financed. Whatever "old money" they may once have had has long since
been spent or squandered.</TE>
<TE>   The head of the Slocumb household is Mimi (Susan Sarandon), Igby's
monster of a mother, whom he refers to by her first name (when he's
speaking to her at all, that is) because, as he explains, "heinous
one is a bit cumbersome, and Medea was already taken."</TE>
<TE>   His father (Bill Pullman) is an institutionalized schizophrenic,
and Igby fears heredity will dictate his own inevitable decline to a
similar fate. Repressed older brother Oliver (Ryan Phillippe) has
bought into the gilded social status quo, hook, line and silver spoon
(the latter figuring notably in a significant moment in the film).
Then there's smarmy godfather D.H. (Jeff Goldblum), his drug-addled
mistress (Amanda Peet) and quirky Sookie Sapperstein (Claire Danes),
who wins the hearts of both Slocumb brothers, breaking one in the
process.</TE>
<TE>   This melange of WASP dysfunction is a little bit "Catcher in the
Rye," a little bit "The Philadelphia Story" and a little bit "Five
Easy Pieces"--with some "Mommie Dearest" acid searing the edges. If
Igby's going down, his story is serving up a heaping dose of dark
comic irony in his wake. And although he's not always entirely
likeable, we do feel Igby's pain--quite literally from time to time,
as the teen finds himself being smacked upside the head by nearly
every other character in the film, including his therapist.</TE>
<TE>   Like the teens in "Rushmore" and "Tadpole," when Igby rebels
against the slings and arrows of his outrageous fortune, it's more
often verbal than physical. The film does have its requisite share of
sexual provocation, but most of the action in "Igby" takes place
above the neck, not below the waist.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [raunchy teen comedies] have their place," says Steers.
"They're a lot of fun, and that's definitely an aspect of being a
teenager, but there are also really sophisticated kids around."</TE>
<TE>   Steers knows from whence he writes. "I'm from that world," he says
of Igby's upper-class background. He was born and raised in
Washington, D.C. His father was a state politician, his mother a
member of the Auchincloss family. His uncle is author and playwright
Gore Vidal, who makes a cameo appearance in the film. For sure,
Steers has broken bread with a Kennedy or two in his time.</TE>
<TE>   Stories of the upper class hold a prominent place in 20th century
American literature--Vidal has written many himself. But for all
their influence on our lives and times, the native gentry hasn't been
much on view in motion pictures. Perhaps this is, in part, because
the film business has its genesis in Jewish immigrants who were
denied access to the gates of real power and felt either unworthy or
too resentful to tell such tony tales. Most often, the perspective
offered on the very rich is one of too much money, too little
morality.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not well-plowed territory," declares Vidal. "You have to
know the field, and not many writers or directors or actors come from
that. The only actor who really came from that world was Katharine
Hepburn," he recalls. "And she was considered really exotic."</TE>
<TE>   But why the reluctance to explore the American upper crust through
a camera lens? "We've got the cleverest upper class on Earth," Vidal
observes dryly, speaking on the phone from his home in Italy.
"They've persuaded everyone they don't exist."</TE>
<TE>   With appropriate avuncular pride, Vidal points to the high degree
of authenticity in his nephew's fictionalized treatment of the
well-born and -bred. "These people are real to Burr, and he's enough
of a writer-director to make them very real for the audience.</TE>
<TE>   "They're his people, why on earth would he lie about them? Only
the untalented ones lie," he admonishes, adding, "there's something
called imagination, mind you, where one can be false to an absolute
truth. And Burr has that, certainly."</TE>
<TE>   Like his film's protagonist, Steers was bounced from several elite
private schools, in his case the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut and
Indiana's Culver Military Academy. "It's not an easy thing to get
kicked out of a military school," claims Steers who now lives in
Silver Lake. "They only kick out the people that really want to be
there. The people who don't want to be there they make clean the
latrines with a toothbrush."</TE>
<TE>   Steers left home in his mid-teens and moved to New York. Like
Igby, he finished high school by way of a GED exam. He later gained
entrance to New York University.</TE>
<TE>   While Steers veers sharply from autobiography to fiction for most
of the particulars of his film's story, there is, alas, one more
trait he shares with Igby: genteel poverty. "There was no money for
me, no trust fund," he notes ruefully. "I've always worked, ever
since I was a teenager. The only thing that's rich about me is my
voice."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Steers, 36, speaks in a deep, mellifluous tone emblematic
of both his patrician pedigree and past life as an aspiring actor.
He's been in a number of films, including "Last Days of Disco" and
"Pulp Fiction."</TE>
<TE>   Igby first came to life in novel form, but as Steers began to see
his story in more visual terms, he developed it into a screenplay.
Script in hand, he was able to attract A-list talent such as Sarandon
and Goldblum, who had been an early acting teacher of Steers'. "None
of these actors was getting paid what they normally get paid," he
says. "It was their attachment that got the money that got the film
made. Otherwise, no one would give a first-time director money for
this kind of movie."</TE>
<TE>   "Igby" was shot on location last year in New York for a budget of
about $8 million.</TE>
<TE>   As Igby, Culkin is in nearly every scene of the film, and audience
response relies on whether or not the viewer relates to his reactions
to the goings-on around him.</TE>
<TE>   Culkin, 19, also co-starred earlier this year in "The Dangerous
Lives of Altar Boys" and is making a name for himself for bringing to
vivid life off-center, unconventional characters. He has acted
professionally since his debut in a television commercial at age 6.
Older brother Macauley, who just turned 22, skyrocketed to
high-paying stardom in "Home Alone" (1990). Kieran's younger brother,
Rory, 13, currently appears as Mel Gibson's asthmatic son in "Signs."</TE>
<TE>   "Kieran's an old soul," observes Emily Gerson Saines, who has
managed the family's show business careers since 1994. At that time,
Macauley had just made "Richie Rich"--and announced to his new
manager that he didn't want to work anymore. Fortunately, Kieran had
no such reservations--or better taste.</TE>
<TE>   According to Gerson Saines, "When Kieran first came into himself,
which was around the time of "The Mighty" [1998], we talked about
what would enable him to become a great actor, and we decided he
should pick movies that had great scripts or great directors or great
co-stars, people that he could learn from." Indeed, young Culkin was
more seasoned in the craft of filmmaking than his director, but he
was also aware of how close to Steers the story was. "Obviously, Burr
understands every moment of the script. All the characters are his,
and he really cares about them. I could tell that as soon as I read
it."</TE>

<LD>"America Rebuilds." "America Remembers." "The Day America Changed."
"The Day That Changed America."</LD>
<LD>   If the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks shocked the nation to its core,
the one-year anniversary of that day, at least on television, is
being carried out as an all-day exercise in tribute-paying and
meaning-gleaning. To an extent, the coverage is understandable, given
that for most of the nation, Sept. 11 unfolded as a TV event.</LD>
<LD>   But there is so much coverage planned--from MTV to Court TV, from
ABC to A&amp;E--that the documentaries and specials, however poignant and
well-researched, run the risk of canceling out each other, until all
that emerges is a sense that the TV industry will be attending a
funeral, and everyone will be dressed appropriately in black.</LD>
<TE>   ABC, CBS and NBC are giving their airwaves over to news
programs--morning, noon and night, in most cases--as the respective
networks roll out their star anchors and commentators for
wall-to-wall anniversary coverage.</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, it appears that TV viewers will be deluged with
what author and cultural critic Todd Gitlin, writing in the New York
Observer in 1994 about the 25th anniversary of the Woodstock
festival, referred to as "the standard, once-over-moistly anniversary
piece [that] is a ritual of national self-celebration."</TE>
<TE>   The broadcast networks' decision to give prime-time over to news
is a little less beneficent given that the anniversary happens to
fall at the tail end of network prime-time's rerun season, before the
new programs are launched. Advertisers, too, have indicated
reluctance about being on the air.</TE>
<TE>   Across the dial, the themes are sure to overlap: Updates on the
families of victims. Homeland security discussions. Talking heads,
and the question, "How has America changed?" posed over and over.</TE>
<TE>   "Anniversaries are rituals, and they are rituals that for people
have meaning," said Betsy West, senior vice president of prime-time
for CBS News. "Like it or not, 9/11 is a day that will forever be
charged with meaning for most Americans."</TE>
<TE>   Asked what new information her network will impart, West pointed
to Scott Pelley's exclusive interview with President Bush, airing on
"60 Minutes II." Pelley has already interviewed Bush on Air Force
One; next week, he'll sit down with Bush in the Oval Office. Though
Bush's movements in the hours after the attacks have been chronicled
in print, West argued that, on television, "We have not heard the
story of what happened minute-to-minute. It's an oral history of what
went on that day."</TE>
<TE>   In prime-time, CBS also will re-air the documentary "9/11," with
footage captured by two French filmmakers who happened to be
chronicling the day in the life of a firefighter on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   NBC will have the "Concert for America," featuring performances by
such artists as Placido Domingo, Aretha Franklin, Gloria Estefan and
Josh Groban, and hosted by Tom Brokaw (who does a town meeting
earlier in the day). The concert, which will be taped Sept. 9 at
Washington's Kennedy Center, was organized by the network in
collaboration with the Bush White House.</TE>
<TE>   On ABC, Peter Jennings gets his own town hall, a follow-up to a
previous special, "Answering Children's Questions," while in
prime-time, "Good Morning America" co-host Charles Gibson does a
comprehensive reconstruction of the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   From 9 to 11 p.m., Fox will air "The Day America Changed," a
documentary produced by Fox News Channel, which will also be offering
feeds of its news coverage to Fox affiliates all day.</TE>
<TE>   Fox News Channel, says senior producer Thom Bird, will attend to
the anniversary from several angles--covering the memorials that day
in New York, Washington, D.C., and Shanksville, Pa., reconstructing
the day of the attacks, and examining the hunt for Osama bin Laden.
But Bird, whose network has risen to the top of the cable news
ratings pile via a brash, talk-radio approach to 24-hour news, says
Fox News Channel won't shrink from that mandate on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Whereas other channels will focus more on the sorrow and
bereavement part, Fox is more take-charge, kick-butt kind of
thinking," Bird said.</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the spectrum is PBS and its investigative
series "Frontline." Several weeks after the terrorist attacks,
documentary filmmaker Helen Whitney began working on the project that
would become "Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero." The two-hour
documentary, told in four acts, is an examination of what the events
that day did to the big theodicy questions, including "Is there a
God?"</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't sense there was a big stampede to cover these
questions," said Whitney, who spoke to some 370 people; the 20-odd
interviews in the film range from novelist Ian McEwan and opera
singer Renee Fleming to loved ones of the dead and survivors of the
World Trade towers' collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because the answers are uncomfortable and belie
resolution, spiritual ambiguity in the wake of Sept. 11 remains
fertile territory for a storyteller. "I have been surprised for a
long while that given that we're one of the most religious countries
in the world, that the networks and other cable stations don't dig
more deeply into that area," Whitney said.</TE>
<TE>   PBS has also taped public service announcements, with "Mr. Rogers"
creator Fred Rogers offering parents advice on how to comfort their
kids, said Alice Myatt, PBS' senior vice president of programming.
While the children's show "Zoom" will feature a 9/11-themed special,
other programming won't be preempted or changed, said Myatt, because
PBS wants to provide kids a "safe haven" from the blanket coverage
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   At the cable networks, Sid Bedingfield, executive editor of the
CNN News Group, said CNN will air footage that "was crowded out by
events of the day," including video of the press corps that was
covering Bush that day.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think there are details that got lost," Bedingfield added.
"There are details about what the intelligence agencies knew and the
effort to connect the dots, where they succeeded and where they
failed. There are details about what happened in Washington when it
was considered that the White House may be a target.</TE>
<TE>   "What we want to get beyond is merely marking the day, remembering
what happened, and move forward to actual reporting on what's coming
next," he said. "What do we know about what happened that's new and
fresh? Sometimes it's going back and pulling together the threads of
the story that puts it in context."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, even the niche outlets are striving to pay homage.
Cable's Food Network (as well as other Scripps Network-owned
home-improvement channels), plans to go dark from 8:30 a.m. to 10:30
a.m. on Sept. 11, playing what a network representative described as
"tasteful, mellow, instrumental music that's appropriate for the
day."</TE>
<TE>   If there isn't a Food Network show that can neatly conform to the
anniversary of the attacks, other niche and general interest cable
networks are bending their programming brands to fit the occasion,
both on Sept. 11 and in the days leading up to the anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   The pay-cable network Showtime will offer "Reflections From Ground
Zero," hosted by filmmaker Spike Lee, a mini-festival of nine short
films around the theme of Sept. 11 from New York University film
students. MTV says it will offer consoling music videos, "video
postcards" in which artists share their thoughts and experiences, and
a special one-hour live forum Sept. 11 to be hosted by Carson Daly of
the popular "TRL."</TE>
<TE>   The Discovery Channel's "Portraits of Grief" special is based on
the New York Times' exhaustive, award-winning "Portraits of Grief"
snapshots of the thousands who perished in the World Trade Center
towers. The financial news network CNBC will offer what it calls
"thoughtful and comprehensive programming tailored to the financial
community."</TE>
<TE>   Context is not something at which broadcast news excels, critics
have long contended. According to Gitlin, most recently author of the
book "Media Unlimited: How the Torrent of Images and Sounds
Overwhelms Our Lives," people in the news business used to have a
name for a story that was too obscure or complicated to sell to the
public. They would call it "Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   That was then, this is now. Networks plan to check in with
correspondents around the globe, but media watchdogs are anticipating
that the reflexive coverage will fall short. The less telegenic
issues, they say--the post-9/11 effect on civil liberties, here and
abroad, the aftermath on the ground of U.S. military strikes in
Afghanistan--won't be able to compete with the emotional stories
networks will sell all day.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine, a year after the actual trauma, [that] this
industry is capable of doing a good job of accounting for its
emotional impact and telling us the truth about what happened and
what may happen," said Mark Crispin Miller, professor of media
studies at New York University and the author of "Boxed In: The
Culture of TV."</TE>
<TE>   "TV is really bad at giving us background.... You know they're
going to heat up this big bath of emotionalism, and urge us all to
jump in."</TE>

<LD>How much slack should we cut mediocre music just because it's
well-meaning?</LD>
<LD>   That's a question that has been raised frequently in the year
since Sept. 11 as an army of songwriters--including three Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame members--has stepped forward to comment on the
horror and heartache of that unprecedented event.</LD>
<LD>   In most cases, the only good thing we can say about their efforts
is that they have been well-meaning.</LD>
<TE>   Is there anyone in America who didn't roll his or her eyes when
Paul McCartney performed his new song "Freedom" during an otherwise
touching performance at last October's "The Concert for New York" at
Madison Square Garden?</TE>
<TE>   Or is there anyone who didn't yawn when Neil Young came along last
year with "Let's Roll," his tribute to the passengers on the hijacked
United Airlines flight that crashed in Pennsylvania to thwart that
leg of the terrorist attacks?</TE>
<TE>   Even the normally reliable Bruce Springsteen occasionally stumbled
in his album "The Rising," trying so hard to offer comfort to the
nation that he ended up padding the 73-minute collection with some
generic, feel-good exercises.</TE>
<TE>   Several country artists also checked in, with Alan Jackson's
"Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)" and Toby Keith's
"Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)"
representing the extremes of emotion.</TE>
<TE>   There's a winning sense of homespun humility about the Jackson
tune, and we'll probably hear a lot of it on Sept. 11 retrospectives
in coming days:</TE>
<TE>   Did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor?</TE>
<TE>   In a crowded room did you feel alone?</TE>
<TE>   Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?</TE>
<TE>   Did you dust off that Bible at home?</TE>
<TE>   Like most of the Sept. 11 songs, however, "Where Were You" lacks
the grace and wonder of the most inspiring music. It sounds like "Hey
Jude," however, next to Keith's clumsy battle cry, which includes the
lines:</TE>
<TE>   This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage</TE>
<TE>   And you'll be sorry that you messed with the U.S. of A</TE>
<TE>   'Cause we'll put a boot in your ass.</TE>
<TE>   It's understandable that successful songwriters (as well as scores
of aspiring ones) feel compelled to express themselves in a time of
trauma. They have been blessed with the ability to communicate and
feel it is their duty to make music, the same way a firefighter feels
it's his or her duty to go into a burning building.</TE>
<TE>   In the process, it is easy to lose artistic discipline and
judgment. The biggest mistake is trying to write an anthem that
addresses the topic head-on rather than with a poetic distance.</TE>
<TE>   It was touching that McCartney was one of the first to volunteer
for the New York benefit concert last fall, but "Freedom" was
lyrically stiff and it lacked the soothing melodic touches of his
best work.</TE>
<TE>   The veteran rocker apparently thought the emotion suggested by
heartfelt declarations such as "I will fight for the right to live in
freedom" would give the song power. They didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Young seemed to feel a straightforward description of the
passengers' brave actions in the plane would be enough to give "Let's
Roll" a sense of drama and fervor. It wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   Even Springsteen was a bit too literal in choosing images for
"Into the Fire" and "The Rising," the two songs on his new album that
speak most directly to the events of Sept. 11. In concert Saturday at
the Forum, he sang "Into the Fire" with such conviction and eloquence
that it came marvelously alive. On record, however, there's a
flatness to lines such as, "I need you near, but love and duty called
you someplace higher."</TE>
<TE>   The most moving songs on his album are the ones that look at the
lingering emotional wounds of the day, including "Empty Sky," "You're
Missing" and "Paradise." It's hard to listen to those and other key
songs from "The Rising" without flashing back to the heartbreaking
images of those days--from the crumbling towers to the hundreds of
photos of missing loved ones that were posted on walls near the World
Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   That's why, of the high-profile Sept. 11 compositions,
Springsteen's do the best job of offering comfort and perspective.</TE>
<TE>   But his isn't the only approach. Where the New Jersey native
wanted to urge the shaken nation to "rise up," another major
singer-songwriter felt compelled to say, "wake up."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Earle's new album, "Jerusalem," won't be released until Oct.
8, but it is already attracting attention--and criticism--because of
"John Walker's Blues." In the song, Earle tries to put himself in the
shoes of John Walker Lindh, the 21-year-old Californian who has
pleaded guilty to fighting alongside the Taliban militia in
Afghanistan. Walker is expected to be sentenced to 20 years in
prison. The song includes the lines:</TE>
<TE>   We came to fight the Jihad and our hearts were pure and strong</TE>
<TE>   As death filled the air we all offered up prayers</TE>
<TE>   And prepared for our martyrdom.</TE>
<TE>   Earle is prepared to hear some boos when he goes on tour this
fall, but it won't be the first time. Once called the Springsteen of
country music, Earle has been a vocal opponent of the death penalty,
penning such eloquent songs as 1995's "Ellis Unit One," which
suggested that executions damage rather than strengthen the fabric of
society. That's not a popular position.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the new song this week, Earle said by phone from his
studio in Nashville, "As soon as I heard about Walker, I thought
about my own 20-year-old son and how I would feel if it was him. I am
not OK with anybody taking up arms for any reason, so I have some
major problems with what John Walker did in that sense. But I didn't
like the way everyone was so quick to vilify him.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed a symptom of a larger problem. There's a tendency in
times like these to give our law enforcement officials and military a
blank check to do whatever they want to. That's not what our country
is about. We've got to treat everyone's civil liberties fairly, even
if it's John Walker."</TE>
<TE>   Despite their different tones, the music of Springsteen and Earle
offers the most memorable musical statements coming out of Sept. 11,
and it is important to recognize that the words of Earle are as
well-meaning--in the best sense--as those of Springsteen.</TE>

<LD>May 2: News reports say Bill Clinton is in preliminary discussions
with NBC to host a daytime talk show, which would pay the former
president millions.</LD>
<LD>   Aug. 21: News reports say Bill Clinton is in preliminary
discussions with CBS to host a daytime talk show, which would pay the
former president millions.</LD>
<LD>   Given that interval, expect to hear rumors about the former
president hosting an ABC companion to "The View" around Dec. 10, then
another flurry regarding a Fox late-night show (perhaps paired with
Jillian Barberie, to attract that younger demographic) in late March.</LD>
<TE>   Despite skepticism that such a deal will ever happen, the idea of
Clinton raking in millions thanks to his mastery of television hardly
sounds far-fetched--especially if you take into account show-business
folk's almost comic infatuation with the political class and Clinton
in particular. Sure, executives hobnob with movie stars, but most
approach Clinton like giddy schoolkids.</TE>
<TE>   Not far-fetched, either, because on a fundamental level, the
Clinton administration has already earned every penny--the man from
Hope having granted studio moguls just about everything business-wise
they could have hoped for.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton's two terms in office, after all, gave new meaning to the
image of gaudy Hollywood marriages--giving rise to power couplings of
the corporate variety. Westinghouse bought CBS and later dealt those
assets to Viacom. Disney merged with ABC. AOL marched to the altar
with Time Warner, and so on.</TE>
<TE>   Those unions and others became possible due to the elimination of
federal guidelines that had effectively barred a studio from buying a
network. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 followed, gutting
regulation of cable and telecommunications while dramatically
relaxing ownership rules in TV and radio.</TE>
<TE>   Radio underwent staggeringly rapid consolidation, as more than
half of U.S. stations were sold in the next five years and a single
company, Clear Channel Communications, amassed over 1,200 outlets.
The number of TV owners dwindled as well, including more "duopolies,"
where one entity owns two stations in the same city.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton administration also supported legislation coveted by
film studios to extend copyright protection and to safeguard
copyrighted material on the Internet--areas where billions of dollars
potentially hung in the balance.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, Clinton held Hollywood's feet to the fire--albeit at a safe
distance, so no one need worry about getting burned--on such issues
as educational children's programming and formulating a system for
rating TV content, but that represented a standard quid pro quo: You
guys give me a couple of "family values"-oriented concessions to
campaign on, and we'll scale back regulation pretty much to your
heart's content.</TE>
<TE>   "The commercial entertainment industry did real well during the
Clinton years," said Robert McChesney, a professor of communications
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and author of the
book "Rich Media, Poor Democracy: Communication Politics in Dubious
Times."</TE>
<TE>   Although Republicans are more often associated with that sort of
pro-business stance, differences between the parties on media policy
amounts to "one inch on a mile-long field," McChesney said, due to
the influence of money and lobbying. Against that backdrop, he called
Clinton's push for the V-chip and other reforms "small-potatoes
stuff" compared to matters with more serious financial ramifications.</TE>
<TE>   "They set it up for the Bush administration to come in and knock
it out of the ballpark in terms of deregulation," agreed Sandra
Ortiz, executive director of the USC Annenberg School for
Communication's Center for Communication Law and Policy, who added
that the fallout from those changes has led to "the demise of one
independent producer after another."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, conspiracy theorists are quick to point out that most
news outlets have remained conspicuously silent on the implications
of media consolidation. And while that probably stems as much from
laziness and public ennui as anything else, it is true that the news
divisions that are largely ignoring these questions are owned by the
very conglomerates that benefited from those hands-off
policies--among them Tribune Co., which capitalized on the
anticipated easing of TV-newspaper ownership rules to acquire the Los
Angeles Times.</TE>
<TE>   In short, whether or not Clinton ultimately goes Hollywood, he's
earned the stipend. Besides, given the handful of contenders fronting
new talk shows premiering next month, it's clear the factory that
churns out hosts is struggling to meet demand.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Phil McGraw? Haven't "Oprah" fans suffered enough during his
guest spots? Caroline Rhea is a female comic, but is that the sole
requirement to fill Rosie O'Donnell's shoes? Wayne Brady is a gifted
impressionist and improv performer, but every day? John Walsh has a
captive audience--literally, if you count the 700-plus people behind
bars thanks to "America's Most Wanted"--while Rob Nelson's main
credential is looking young enough to be Phil Donahue's grandson.</TE>
<TE>   Programmers have grown desperate to find a talk hit after years of
misfires--including last year's name game, which briefly compelled
the press to learn how to spell Ananda and Iyanla. Hungry for star
power, Universal Television, which distributes "Crossing Over With
John Edward," enlisted Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, to host a
show tentatively set for September 2003. Now if she could just master
talking to the dead.</TE>
<TE>   However one feels about Clinton--and it seems safe to say no one
is neutral--he proved himself to be a deft communicator and true
friend of Hollywood. In addition, that coziness between media moguls
and occupants of the West Wing is sure to continue--the coagulation
of fame, money, big politics and bigger media creating a potion
difficult for anyone involved to resist.</TE>
<TE>   As such, don't be surprised if rumors begin swirling about
"Bush-Whacked!"--a comedy-variety-hidden-camera show hosted by
you-know-who for the Dubya-Dubya-WB--as soon as the 43rd president
leaves office ... unless, of course, he decides what he really wants
to do is direct.</TE>

<HD>Fred Thompson Set for 'Law &amp; Order' Role</HD>
<DH>Television: NBC confirms U.S. senator will return to
acting, before he leaves office.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lawyer-turned-actor-turned-United States senator Fred Thompson is
becoming an actor again before his term officially expires, with NBC
confirming that the Tennessee Republican will join the cast of "Law &amp;
Order" this fall, playing the role of the New York district attorney.</LD>
<LD>   In a surprise, Thompson--who had previously announced that he
would not seek reelection in November--is beginning production on the
show this week, meaning he will be featured when the series opens its
13th season in October, while he's still in the Senate. He replaces
Dianne Wiest, ending the Oscar-winning actress' two-year stint on the
show.</LD>
<LD>   When reports of Thompson's possible casting surfaced, it was
anticipated that he would not start working on the show before his
term concluded at the end of this year. Thompson's spokesman, Harvey
Valentine, said the senator had told the producers that "his
commitment to the Senate would be foremost" until his term is over.
He is currently on a recess this week and will have another break in
October to film additional episodes.</LD>
<TE>   Valentine said he was unaware of any legislation relating to
telecommunications or NBC that might force the senator to recuse
himself. In a statement, Thompson said, " 'Law &amp; Order' has been one
of television's leading drama series for over a decade. It is
well-written, well-acted, and always topical. I look forward to
working with this talented cast and being a part of this quality
series."</TE>
<TE>   Although legislators have appeared in cameo roles in movies such
as "Dave," it may be without precedent for a sitting U.S. senator to
have a regular part in a dramatic TV program. NBC's press release
made no reference to Thompson's current position, billing him as a
"former prosecutor and accomplished film and television actor."</TE>
<TE>   Wiest's agent, at ICM, did not return a phone call regarding her
departure.</TE>
<TE>   According to the producers, Thompson's character is a political
conservative elected district attorney as fallout from the events of
Sept. 11. He will appear on all three installments of the franchise,
including the newer "Law &amp; Order" entries "Special Victims Unit" and
"Criminal Intent."</TE>
<TE>   Elected to the senate in 1994--filling the seat Al Gore vacated
when he become vice president--Thompson, 60, had been an assistant
United States Attorney and served as minority counsel to the Senate
Watergate Committee before embarking on his acting career, which
included roles in the films "The Hunt for Red October," "Barbarians
at the Gate," "No Way Out" and "Die Hard 2."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson announced that he would not run again in March after the
heart attack death of his 38-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, though he
said the decision was not attributable to "one thing."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement then, he said, "I simply do not have the heart for
another six-year term.... I feel that I have other priorities that I
need to attend to."</TE>
<TE>   Cast changes have become commonplace on "Law &amp; Order."</TE>

<HD>Revamped 'Birdman' Solves Cartoon Rumors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROGER CATLIN</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cartoon Network has long played with the mythology of its beloved
characters. In clever promos and elaborate specials like the ones it
would concoct around Super Bowl time, the network would mix and match
its animated roster with a cutting modern wit.</LD>
<LD>   The channel had never actually gone to court, though, until now.</LD>
<LD>   The network has dusted off one of Hanna-Barbera's worst-conceived
superhero characters, Birdman, and given him new life, as was done
for Space Ghost before him. Instead of a clueless, argumentative
talk-show host, though, Birdman has been reincarnated as the loopy
"Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law."</LD>
<TE>   His cases are those that cartoon fans have pondered for ages:</TE>
<TE>   Were Scooby-Doo and his crew stoned all the time? Is that what
caused the needless guffaws and the constant hunger for snacks?</TE>
<TE>   What exactly was the relationship between Dr. Quest and Race
Bannon on "Jonny Quest"?</TE>
<TE>   And barring lingering questions about cartoon behavior, why not
make up some dark secrets about the two-dimensional:</TE>
<TE>   Yogi Bear sidekick Boo Boo as a masked bomber: the Una-Boo-Boo? Or
Fred Flintstone as a mob boss who hangs out at the Dabba-Doo, a strip
club not unlike Tony Soprano's Bada-Bing? And cross this
Hanna-Barbera kingpin, and you might end up, as Harvey Birdman
did--with the severed head of Quick Draw McGraw in your bed.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, these are the kinds of twisted questions better suited
to an older (although not necessarily grown-up) audience.</TE>
<TE>   Hence, "Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law" appears Sundays at 11:30
p.m. as part of the Cartoon Network's "Adult Swim," a collection of
cartoons of interest to older viewers shown on weekend nights.</TE>
<TE>   Since "Harvey Birdman" first appeared nearly a year ago, the
favorable reaction has led the network to order 20 new episodes,
which began last month.</TE>
<TE>   Creators Michael Ouleween and Erik Richter say it's the kind of
series they were born to do.</TE>
<TE>   "It is kind of weird," Ouleween told a group of TV critics
recently. "I almost feel like when I grew up watching this stuff that
I was going to do this. I don't know if that makes any sense, but I
would watch 'Super Friends' and go, 'God, why did they put those
stupid sidekicks in?' Like I was already writing then."</TE>
<TE>   He gets his chance now, as in the new episode in which minor super
friend Apache Chief sues after hot coffee scalds him.</TE>
<TE>   But they don't want to go too far. "We consider ourselves kind of
caretakers of these characters in a way," says Richter, who notes
that the approach has to be, well, "careful is not the word."</TE>
<TE>   "Respectful but irreverent," Ouleween offers.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," Richter assents, "because there are still people who watch
these shows--like us--who watch Huck Hound or whatever."</TE>
<TE>   "Without irony," Ouleween says, finishing Richter's thought.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, Richter says, "you want to take gentle shots at these
characters and not body blows."</TE>
<TE>   "We like to take people and play upon the rumors that people have
had for a number of years, like about Shaggy or Race and Dr. Quest,"
Ouleween says. "And sometimes we like to just come up with something
new. But either way, we're left to play with it as we will. And no
character is sacred."</TE>
<TE>   "And one of the beauties is that Fred Flintstone is not going to
sue you for defamation of character," says Brad Siegel, president of
Turner Networks, which owns the Cartoon Network.</TE>

<HD>Tuck &amp; Patti Sustain Talent as a Twosome</HD>
<DH>The husband-wife team-- he plays guitar, she sings--
continue a remarkable run of distinctive music.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to longevity as an entertainment-world performing
couple, Tuck &amp; Patti have been around a surprisingly long
time--closer to the three-plus decades of George Burns &amp; Gracie Allen
than the considerably more limited run of Sonny &amp; Cher. Working as a
duo for 24 years, they have been a married couple for 21. And
watching them in action at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill on Monday night, one
could only marvel at their remarkable capacity to triumph over the
marriage admonition: "For better or for worse, but never for lunch."</LD>
<LD>   Their opening set was an impressive display of musicality,
balancing each of their individual skills with the symbiotic musical
interaction that has characterized their relationship from the
beginning. As singer Patti Cathcart pointed, they have built up such
a vast repertoire of material that it can be hard to decide what to
offer at any given performance. But with the new Tuck &amp; Patti CD,
"Chocolate Moment," just released--the first on their own label--a
goodly amount of the set was devoted to material from the album,
including Cathcart's wittily seductive rendering of the title track.</LD>
<LD>   Other tunes ranged from Cyndi Lauper's "Time After Time" to Bob
Dorough's "Better Than Anything," with guitarist Tuck Andress
enlivening the evening with a long, hilarious introduction to "Early
Morning Music Box," essentially describing it as a kind of accidental
composition.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the talent flying in all directions, the heartbeat of Tuck
&amp; Patti's music traces to the now utterly intuitive musical linkage
between the pair. Andress' guitar, marvelous in its own right, is
also an integral part of the way Cathcart sings, punctuating her
lines, adding counterpoint, driving in tandem with her rhythm. And,
vice versa, her singing flows through his guitar phrases, often
surprising him with a sudden shift of direction, stimulating his
spontaneous creativity.</TE>
<TE>   The only less-than-superlative aspect of the program was the
tendency to finish too many pieces with long, extended vamps. While
they allowed Cathcart ample room for scatting, their harmonic
repetitiveness occasionally became wearying--a musical framework too
limiting and too lacking in expressive potential for this otherwise
superb musical pair.</TE>

<HD>Comedy in Las Vegas: It's a Tough Room</HD>
<DH>Stand-Up: Second City's talented performers are surviving
the competition that Sin City has to offer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS JONES</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Sketch comedy is never an easy way to make a living, but if an
improviser should ever die and go to hell, the ultimate torture would
be a gig on the Las Vegas Strip.</LD>
<LD>   For the last two years, Chicago's Second City has been plugging
away doing a Vegas show in rented space at the Flamingo Las Vegas
Hotel. Even though crushed on all sides by themed mega-resorts, the
Flamingo (formerly the Flamingo Hilton) is a timeless kind of
old-line joint that never has journeyed too far away from the spirit
of Bugsy Siegel, the fellow who once owned and operated the place.</LD>
<LD>   It's reflected in the clientele. The California hipsters
congregate down the Strip at either Mandalay Bay or New York, New
York; the wealthy go to Bellagio; conventioneers hit the Venetian.
The Flamingo, where the neon is iconic and the only theme is
funny-looking pink birds, attracts a lot of tour groups and mature
dollar-slot players.</LD>
<TE>   Gladys Knight, the hotel's resident headliner, gets the tony room
with the flashy entrance. Second City finds itself in the former home
of "Forever Plaid," a strangely shaped room separated from the main
casino only by an unlikely combination of windows and curtains. As
the performers do their thing, one can hear the unmistakable clatter
of slot machines and the collective bark of the craps table, both
competing with the piano player. It's a tough room.</TE>
<TE>   It's clear from the pre-show chatter that Second City doesn't mean
much here. Its greatest practitioners may have cult-like status in
Chicago, but for the past two decades in Vegas, the word "improv" has
been a simile for stand-up comedy. Second City's uniquely theatrical
form of unified sketch comedy--with its recurring themes, interwoven
narratives, intense character development, quick-fire blackouts and
inherent subversion--might as well be from a theatrical Mars.</TE>
<TE>   Second City is used to playing to tourists in Chicago, but it can
usually rely on a core audience that enjoys seeing the paper tigers
of everyday Midwestern life brought down to their knees. In Vegas,
the audience comes from all over the world and shares few common
experiences--which is why David Copperfield learned to speak some
Japanese so he could interact with his volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Vegas may be the only thing these folks have in common, but that
doesn't mean they want to see it attacked. By definition, gamblers
are not rationalists. And one does not journey to a fantasy
environment in a desert to have that very fantasy shattered right in
front of your tired eyes when you've just gotten off a plane.</TE>
<TE>   That explains why the Second City Vegas show does not feature any
local fare--skits about the guys handing out the escort magazines or
the horrors of losing have all been removed from the show, victims of
a lame audience response. Instead, Second City is offering a
collection of generally decent archival material that features a lot
of improv and tries to gently coax its audience into understanding
its modus operandi.</TE>
<TE>   Even as its Chicago companies do comedy about terrorists and
racism, Second City Vegas plays it safer than the house edge. There's
the scene where a family goes back in time; the song created from the
job of an audience member; the freeze game.</TE>
<TE>   The five-member Vegas group is made up of solid hard-workers such
as the droll Seamus McCarthy and the smart-witted Jason Sudeikis.
Standout Kay Cannon is an especially vibrant presence. By the end of
the intermissionless show (another inviolate Vegas convention), the
audience was warming to the act. For all the inherent problems, the
house was packed at 10:30 p.m. on a Tuesday night.</TE>

<LD>   Australian Census: The Force Is With Them</LD>
<LD>   The Australian Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday that more than
70,000 people in Australia identified their religion as Jedi in last
year's census.</LD>
<TE>   As in Alec Guinness' Obi-Wan Kenobi and "Star Wars."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Brennan, president of the Star Wars Appreciation Society,
speculated that only 5,000 of the Jedi respondents were "hard-core"
believers. Another 50,000 put it down for fun, and the others "did it
just to give the government a bit of curry."</TE>
<TE>   The prank began in 2001 when "Star Wars" fans sent an e-mail
around the world saying that if 10,000 people declared they were
Jedi, the faith would be recognized as an official religion. In the
end, the Australia government labeled the responses "not defined."</TE>
<TE>   In the United Kingdom, which also received thousands of Jedi
responses, Jedi Knight has been included on the list of religions by
census authorities.</TE>

<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   Musical Ghostwriter Wants Center Stage</TE>
<TE>   Ghostwriting music--farming out assignments to uncredited
composers--isn't unusual in TV and movies where hectic schedules and
tight deadlines are the norm. Mark Northam, publisher of Film Music
magazine, has engaged in it himself--calling it "one of the dirty
little secrets" of those industries.</TE>
<TE>   No longer. According to the Detroit Free Press, Dan Kolton has
filed a nine-page copyright claim maintaining that he--not Joe
LoDuca, the composer of record--has legal copyright to music for
nearly 1,000 episodes of the "Xena: Warrior Princess," "Hercules: The
Legendary Journeys" and "Young Hercules" TV shows.</TE>
<TE>   The claim could alter the way in which credit and royalties are
awarded--and may be worth millions of dollars over time because the
shows remain in syndication worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Kolton, a jazz bassist, worked for his friend LoDuca between 1995
and 1999, his lawyer, Brian Lee Corber, explains. Without an
agreement granting LoDuca the right to claim "his originally authored
music," the material should be considered the property of the
creator, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment lawyer Henry Baskin isn't so sure. The lack of a
contract is a problem, he concedes. But since Kolton was paid for his
services, he should relinquish his rights, Baskin says.</TE>
<TE>   Though the claim was filed earlier this year, it has just been
processed by the Registrar of Copyrights. If rejected, Corber says,
Kolton will probably file a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   LoDuca, who won an Emmy for his work on "Xena," is aware of the
claim but declined to talk about it.</TE>

<TE>   Glass Ceiling Intact, New Survey Reports</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment and media companies remain essentially boys clubs,
according to a survey released Tuesday by the Annenberg Public Policy
Center at the University of Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   The glass ceiling for women is more evident than ever, it
maintained, because consolidation has made for fewer high-level jobs.
In the arenas of entertainment, cable and the Internet, men accounted
for more than 75% of top executives--chairs, vice chairs, presidents,
chief executives and operating officers.</TE>
<TE>   "With few exceptions, we have not moved beyond tokenism," said
Susan News, a former FCC commissioner who directed the project.</TE>
<TE>   Among the companies in which women are "significantly
underrepresented" in corporate executive positions or board seats:
Fox Entertainment Group, AOL Time Warner, the Walt Disney Co., USA
Networks, MGM, NBC, Clear Channel and AMC Entertainment, Variety
reports. (Sony Pictures Entertainment, Vivendi Universal and
Viacom/Paramount weren't included in the study.)</TE>
<TE>   One bright spot, according to the research: Strides were made in
TV news, where more than 30% of executives are women.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Trombonists Are in Short Supply</TE>
<TE>   More than 50 years after Glenn Miller disappeared over the English
Channel, young people in the United Kingdom are abandoning the
instrument he popularized--the trombone.</TE>
<TE>   A shortage of people who can play that instrument, along with the
double bass, the bassoon and possibly the oboe, means bands may soon
have to look overseas for players.</TE>
<TE>   The National Foundation for Youth Music, set up three years ago by
government ministers, is holding talks with the music industry, local
authorities and schools to raise funds for teacher training and new
instruments, the London newspaper the Guardian reports.</TE>
<TE>   Christina Coker, head of the foundation, said the whole orchestral
bass range was under pressure as children and parents chose cheaper,
less unwieldy instruments such as the flute or clarinet, more given
to solo performing. Another hurdle: the lack of a star to do for the
bass instruments what James Galway did for the flute. "If you own a
bassoon, you can make a living," said Gavin Henderson, director of
London's Trinity College of Music. "If you can play it, you can earn
a fortune."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Peter Jennings has agreed to a new contract that will keep him
anchoring ABC's "World News Tonight" into 2005, sources at the
network say.... Johnny Cash, 70, was hospitalized for an allergic
reaction at Nashville's Baptist Hospital Monday. He was expected to
be released Tuesday afternoon.... Bryant Gumbel married his longtime
girlfriend, Hilary Quinlan, Saturday night at the Breakers Hotel in
Palm Beach, Fla., People.com reports.... Jason Priestley was released
from an Indiana hospital 12 days after he broke a vertebrae and both
feet in a racing car accident....Tony Bennett will headline the 10th

<HD>Fun as a Motherly Frump</HD>
<DH>In the musical 'Hairspray,' Harvey Fierstein portrays a
forlorn housewife with a 'maternal power that transcends gender.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. WYNN ROUSUCK</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Harvey Fierstein is shaving his eyebrows.</LD>
<LD>   This is a first for him. Oh sure, he's worn lipstick and eyeliner,
dresses and falsies, high heels and pantyhose. But before he began
playing Edna Turnblad, the frumpy Baltimore housewife in the new
Broadway musical "Hairspray," Fierstein had never taken razor in hand
and removed all traces of his eyebrows.</LD>
<LD>   "Don't forget the detail of shaving the eyebrows," he says over
the buzz of the electric razor--as if it were possible to overlook
such a distinctive bit of denuding.</LD>
<TE>   This prompts a question that even most veteran reporters never get
a chance to ask: "When did you start shaving your eyebrows?"</TE>
<TE>   "The day before dress rehearsal," the 48-year-old actor answers
matter-of-factly. He is seated in front of the illuminated mirror in
his dressing room at the 5th Avenue Theatre, where "Hairspray" played
a pre-Broadway run earlier this summer.</TE>
<TE>   The eagerly anticipated musical based on John Waters' 1988 movie
opened Aug. 15 on Broadway to glowing reviews. But it was in this
Seattle dressing room that Fierstein honed the look--created by
makeup designer Randy Mercer, wig designer Paul Huntley and costume
designer William Ivey Long--that New York audiences are now seeing.</TE>
<TE>   When Fierstein walks into this little room at 6:30 p.m. he's an
imposing, 6-foot-plus man with short, graying hair and a voice that
sounds remarkably like his electric razor, only several octaves
lower. When he walks on stage shortly after 8 p.m. he's Edna
Turnblad--a (you should pardon the expression) queen-size wife and
mother with straggly auburn hair and the raspiest voice in the show.</TE>
<TE>   Watching Fierstein apply women's makeup is nothing new. Two
decades ago, when Broadway audiences got their first glimpse of him,
he was doing just that, on stage in "Torch Song Trilogy," the drama
that won him Tony Awards in 1983 for best actor and best playwright.</TE>
<TE>   In part, "Torch Song" chronicled a time when Fierstein made a
living playing drag queens with names like Virginia Hamm, Kitty
Litter and Bertha Venation. After making the movie of "Torch Song" in
1988, Fierstein decided he was through with drag.</TE>
<TE>   "I said I've done that for a large part of my career and I do not
need to do that anymore," he explains as he dabs white makeup around
his eyes and foundation on his face.</TE>
<TE>   But 32 years after he first donned a dress on stage (playing an
asthmatic lesbian in Andy Warhol's "Pork"), Fierstein exudes
self-confidence. This is the man whose charge to the 1992 graduating
class at Bennington College was: "Accept no one's definition of your
life, but define yourself." This is the man who recently published a
children's book called "The Sissy Duckling," whose title character
proclaims at the end: "I am a big sissy and proud of it!"</TE>
<TE>   And this is the man who is back in a dress. "This role was too
good to turn down," he says of Edna, mother of "Hairspray" heroine
Tracy, a rotund teenager who becomes a star on a 1960s Baltimore TV
dance show modeled after "The Buddy Deane Show."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Return to Broadway</TE>
<TE>   "Hairspray" marks the first time Fierstein has acted in a Broadway
musical. It's also his return to the Broadway stage after an absence
of 15 years, during which he has had supporting roles in dozens of
films, ranging from "Mrs. Doubtfire" to "Independence Day."</TE>
<TE>   "His career is a kind of icon," says the musical's director, Jack
O'Brien of San Diego's Globe Theatres.</TE>
<TE>   Although Edna is assuredly a female character, the role is
anything but standard-issue drag, as Fierstein, O'Brien and Waters
are quick to point out. Sure, the part was created by Waters' late
cross-dressing star, Divine. But when drag queens impersonate Divine,
they're decked out in the spangly, evening-gowned look from Waters'
1972 cult classic, "Pink Flamingos," not in the housecoat and
slippers Edna wears in the opening scene of "Hairspray." In
traditional drag, O'Brien explains, the performers always comment on
the role. "At some point in the evening they go wink, wink, nudge,
nudge, 'I'm a guy.' Harvey doesn't do that at all," the director
says.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Fierstein, who knew Divine when they were both doing
drag, insists he is not playing Divine; he's playing Edna.</TE>
<TE>   And just how would he describe his character?</TE>
<TE>   "Edna's scared of the world. She's a happy woman in her way, but
her world is indoors. She has her work and she has her wonderful
husband, who she just gets such a kick out of. And she has her
daughter ... and she doesn't have her place in the world anymore,
wherever that is. She's fat, she's ugly, in her mind, and she wants
to stay hidden in the house where it's much more comfortable," says
Fierstein, as he fastidiously underlines his lower lids with
eyeliner.</TE>
<TE>   Playing an agoraphobic housewife--who takes in laundry, no
less--is admittedly a stretch for extroverted Fierstein. Even Edna's
girth is a good deal more ample than that of the actor, who dons a
fat suit that weighs 30 pounds--and gives the impression of far
more--for the role. "There's almost nothing like me in Edna, and
that's what's so much fun," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Fierstein has proved to be "a true collaborator," O'Brien says of
the versatile star, who won his third Tony Award for writing the
libretto for the musical "La Cage aux Folles." "He's quick to make
really wonderful, valuable suggestions, and we're quick to take
them."</TE>
<TE>   Consider, for instance, a line Fierstein came up with for a scene
in which Tracy begins getting phone calls from fans of the TV dance
show. Answering one of these calls, Fierstein's gravelly voiced Edna
growls into the phone, "No, this isn't her father."</TE>
<TE>   There is one respect in which O'Brien believes Fierstein is
similar to Edna. "There is in Harvey an overwhelmingly maternal power
that transcends gender and even attitude," he says. This has
manifested itself most obviously in Fierstein's on-and off-stage
relationship with his co-star, Marissa Jaret Winokur, who plays
Edna's daughter, Tracy. It's a relationship O'Brien compares to "a
mother lioness protecting her young."</TE>
<TE>   And it has carried over to Fierstein's relationship to the other
actors as well. On this particular evening, Dick Latessa, who plays
Edna's spouse, Wilbur, stops by Fierstein's dressing room. "Hello, my
husband," Fierstein gushes.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Bond Davis, who plays a Baltimore deejay named Motormouth
Maybelle, also makes an appearance, bearing a gift--a little red and
green polka-dotted stand shaped like a nose and mouth to hold
Fierstein's eyeglasses (he wears contact lenses in the show).</TE>
<TE>   Before Davis arrived, Fierstein was covering his chest with
pancake makeup to hide an unfortunate outbreak of bumps. "These
little ugly things that I'm covering here are thanks to an experiment
of waxing instead of shaving," he explains.</TE>
<TE>   Calling attention to his chest brings up an aspect of Fierstein's
anatomical transformation that doesn't seem to be explained by either
makeup or padding. On stage, he appears to have cleavage.</TE>
<TE>   "You know we don't share everything," the actor says, shooing a
reporter out of the dressing room to complete his metamorphosis in
private. "That's a little bit of theatrical magic that drag queens
have done for generations."</TE>

<HD>'The Sopranos' Is Heading Off to College</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CALGARY, Alberta</DL>
<LD>The trials and tribulations of television's favorite dysfunctional
crime family, "The Sopranos," are set to be yanked from New Jersey's
mean streets and dissected alongside Shakespeare at a Canadian
university.</LD>
<LD>   The University of Calgary is offering a course this fall that will
examine how the gritty, award-winning HBO series that features mob
boss Tony Soprano, wife Carmela, his gang and his troubled
psychiatrist fits into the gangster film genre.</LD>
<LD>   Inappropriate subject matter for an institute of higher learning?
Fuhgedaboudit, said English professor Maurice Yacowar, who will be
teaching the credit course as part of the university's film studies
program.</LD>
<TE>   "The Sopranos" episodes represent the evolution of the gangster
film style by showing that even denizens of organized crime suffer
the same basic human problems as the rest of us, said Yacowar, author
of the recent book "The Sopranos on the Couch: Analyzing Television's
Greatest Series."</TE>
<TE>   "They really do stand up to the kind of analysis I'm used to
giving for a [Harold] Pinter play, or a Tennessee Williams play, or a
Hitchcock film, or a Shakespeare play," he said Tuesday. "The text is
that rich, the context is that lively." The course has been booked
solid for months. Students will view the 1931 gangster classic "The
Public Enemy," starring James Cagney, then Francis Ford Coppola's
"Godfather" series before studying six episodes of "The Sopranos."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>From a plush hotel in Mexico City to the steaming jungles of Chiapas,
with even a side trip to the serene countryside of Oaxaca as it
appeared half a century ago, the PBS series "American Family" is on
the move tonight in the opening installment of an adventurous
two-part episode titled, appropriately enough, "The Journey" (KCET, 9
p.m.).</LD>
<LD>   As it has done so skillfully throughout this season, the orphan
series that the networks turned their backs on brings a warm unity to
disparate plot threads while gliding in and out of flashbacks with a
sure-handed ease. Directed by executive producer Gregory Nava from a
story by Lorenzo O'Brien and Anna Thomas, tonight's show casts a
soulful eye on issues in the headlines as well as matters of the
heart.</LD>
<LD>   A decision by three members of East Los Angeles' Gonzales clan to
travel to Mexico together on individual quests sets things in motion.</LD>
<TE>   For Jess (Edward James Olmos), it's an opportunity to fulfill a
promise to his late wife, Berta. In a note she had written and then
tucked away shortly before her death, she had asked her husband to
travel to her home state of Oaxaca to hand-deliver a crucifix that
turns out to be the key to Berta's past.</TE>
<TE>   Esteban (Esai Morales) seeks a fresh start with Ofelia (Kate Del
Castillo), but first he'll have to track her down in the most
populous metropolis in the world, Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   And for Nina (Constance Marie), the trip is a mission of mercy,
coordinating the delivery of humanitarian aid collected in East L.A.
for the indigenous Indians in and around Chiapas.</TE>
<TE>   It also turns out to be a mission of great peril, but like all
three story threads left swirling in the Mexican breeze tonight,
viewers will have to wait a week to see them tied up.</TE>

<LD>"Monday Night Football" and the Little League World Series helped
bring some viewers back into ABC's tent last week, while tune-in for
Fox's "American Idol" surged as the show builds toward its finale,
based on viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Buffeted much of the summer, ABC posted its biggest average
audience since May, as the Little League World Series
championship--benefiting from its move to a major network in prime
time--drew its biggest audience since at least 1993.</LD>
<LD>   That said, ABC was still down 25% compared to the same week last
year, while the other major networks each recorded gains of 12% or
more--thanks largely to replacement series such as "Big Brother,"
"Dog Eat Dog" and "American Idol."</LD>
<TE>   According to Fox, "Idol" became its first regularly scheduled
series to finish No. 1 in prime time since "The Simpsons" during the
summer a dozen years ago. Fox still ranked fourth overall last week
but led the pack among adults age 18 to 49--the key measure among
advertisers, and a demographic by which "Idol" has topped the charts
for six consecutive weeks.</TE>
<TE>   One recent boon for ABC has been the USA network series "Monk,"
which held its own despite facing "Idol" and improved on its ABC
premiere the week before by 1.5 million viewers, roughly doubling
what the series had been averaging on cable.</TE>

<LD>Medical research--A story in the Aug. 7 California section
mischaracterized a study at UCLA in which patients were withdrawn
from medication for schizophrenia. The study involved a drug approved
decades ago by the Food and Drug Administration, not a new
medication. UCLA also disputes Bob Aller's assertion that his son,
Greg, was withdrawn from the medication without his knowledge. In
addition, the article should have said that a patient who committed
suicide had ended his active participation in the study, although he
was still involved in follow-up research.</LD>

<HD>Firms Shy Away From Ads on 9/11</HD>
<DH>Marketing: Companies fear TV commercials would be
tasteless; some plan to underwrite programs marking the attacks'
anniversary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While most major advertisers are reluctant to run television
commercials Sept. 11 for fear of being viewed as insensitive, other
corporations are looking for "tasteful" ways to sponsor network
programs.</LD>
<LD>   Nextel Communications Inc. on Tuesday announced that it would once
again underwrite CBS' broadcast of "9/11" on Sept. 11, after
President Bush's planned televised address to the nation. Nextel was
the exclusive underwriter in March when CBS first aired the
documentary on New York City firefighters, which drew 52 million
viewers, one of this year's largest TV audiences.</LD>
<LD>   Nextel joins Boeing Co., which agreed last week to underwrite
NBC's live broadcast of the "Concert for America," from the John F.
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.</LD>
<TE>   Boeing, Nextel and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. are among a small group of
advertisers that plan to be on the air Sept. 11. Although ABC, CBS
and NBC said some advertisers have expressed interest in advertising
on Sept. 11, most have declined rather than risk offending anyone.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to lay low," said Ryndee Carney, spokeswoman for
General Motors Corp., the nation's largest advertiser. "We aren't
going to advertise in regular programming or any retrospectives out
of respect for people's feelings."</TE>
<TE>   Soft-drink companies, including Pepsi-Cola, also will take a pass.
The company's usual fare of fun and bubbly ads just didn't seem
appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt that for that day, it was appropriate to go black," said
Dave DeCecco, spokesman for Pepsi-Cola Northwest.</TE>
<TE>   The decisions underscore the difficult challenge that advertisers
and networks face as they decide how to respectfully recognize the
one-year anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   CBS News is planning all-day coverage called "9/11: The Day That
Changed America." ABC and NBC also are planning a full day of
coverage. ABC's broadcast will include a Peter Jennings forum called
"Answering Children's Questions." NBC's Tom Brokaw will host a town
hall meeting before the "Concert for America," which will include
appearances by first lady Laura Bush, Aretha Franklin, Placido
Domingo, Gloria Estefan and others.</TE>
<TE>   Fox is turning over its two-hour prime-time block, which will air
without commercials, to the Fox News division.</TE>
<TE>   The WB is planning to broadcast the movie "My Dog Skip" as a
"family alternative" to the Sept. 11-themed programming that will
dominate the major broadcast networks. So far, no advertisers have
agreed to buy time during the movie.</TE>
<TE>   The major networks--which after last year's attacks ran news
around the clock for four days without commercials--together lost
about $300 million in advertising revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The networks could lose an estimated $60 million this year if this
Sept. 11 turns out to be commercial-free.</TE>
<TE>   Some cable networks also will run commercial-free programming. The
Discovery Networks, which includes Animal Planet and the Travel
Channel, plan to run commercial-free Sept. 11-related programming.
Lifetime Movie Network, which will present inspirational movies,
decided not to run advertisements on its channel or Web site for the
day.</TE>
<TE>   "We just felt it was the right thing to do," said Patricia
Kollappallil, Lifetime's spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   A recent poll found that more than half of those surveyed believed
it was not appropriate to run ads Sept. 11, according to Lightspeed
Research Inc. Only 34% said it would be acceptable to run ads, the
poll found.</TE>
<TE>   Nextel Communications, however, felt strongly about taking part in
the day's coverage, said company spokeswoman Audrey Schaefer, and
will forgo traditional ads.</TE>
<TE>   The company was overwhelmed with hundreds of e-mails, calls and
letters after it sponsored the March broadcast of "9/11," which was
filmed by two brothers who were in Lower Manhattan that morning
taping a documentary on the firefighters. One of the brothers heard a
roar and turned his camera to the sky, capturing the first plane to
strike the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   Nextel, which provided more than 2,000 cell phones to rescue
workers on the day of the attacks, agreed to underwrite the program
after seeing just a few minutes of footage, Schaefer said. "We felt
the subject matter required the dignity of not having any commercial
interruptions."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Nextel's seven-minute segment was devoted to public
service announcements and a montage honoring the rescue workers.
After the broadcast, Schaefer said, she received more than 600
e-mails, including only one from a viewer who complained about the
harsh language.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not sponsoring commercials, this is underwriting a film,"
Schaefer said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our motivation is certainly not to sell cell phones.... Rather,
we want to mark a day that is about remembrance, reverence and
respect."</TE>
<TE>   Boeing's decision to underwrite the concert had little to do with
building brand identity, a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   "We just identified this as a way to be part of a tasteful event
to showcase the American spirit," said spokeswoman Carol Waitse.</TE>
<TE>   Procter &amp; Gamble, maker of Pampers and Tide, plans to advertise on
Sept. 11, but not during any news programming.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll determine whether it makes sense to be in any particular
program," said spokeswoman Gretchen Muchnick. "We want to pay the
appropriate amount of respect."</TE>

<HD>SEC Tightens Its Deadlines for Disclosure</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Earnings and insider trades will have to be
reported sooner. Companies and shareholder activists praise the
changes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission voted Tuesday to shorten the
amount of time companies have to report earnings and to require stock
trades by corporate insiders to be disclosed within two days. The
moves, aimed at shoring up investor confidence in a year racked by
financial scandals, were applauded by both industry representatives
and shareholder activists.</LD>
<LD>   "These rules are all improvements over existing regulations," said
Ken Bertsch, director of corporate governance services at TIAA-CREF,
a major mutual fund company known for shareholder activism. "What
they've done with insider trading disclosures is very significant. In
terms of providing the market with important information in a timely
fashion, this is a very big improvement."</LD>
<LD>   The changes, approved unanimously by the five-member SEC, come on
two fronts:</LD>
<TE>   First, detailed quarterly and annual financial statements will
have to be filed more quickly with the SEC. That will reduce the risk
that companies will issue rosy news releases about their earnings,
only to reveal problems important to investors months later in their
official SEC filings.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the rules will require company insiders--high-ranking
executives, directors and major shareholders--to report the details
of their stock trades more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Industry groups, which had objected to the SEC's plan to shorten
the filing period for financial reports, were mollified by the
agency's decision to phase in new deadlines over a three-year period.</TE>
<TE>   Annual reports will have to be filed within 60 days of the end of
a company's fiscal year. Companies now have three full months--or 90
days--to file. However, the 60-day deadline won't go into effect
until the end of 2004.</TE>
<TE>   This year there will be no change in reporting requirement dates;
by the end of 2003, the deadline will move forward 15 days, with
filing of annual reports required within 75 days of the end of a
company's fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, quarterly reports, which now must be filed within 45
days of the end of a company's quarter, will eventually have to be
filed within 35 days of the end of a quarter. But there will be no
change this year. By the end of 2003, the deadline will be 40 days
from a quarter's end; in December of 2004, it will move to 35 days.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC originally had proposed cutting the quarterly deadline to
30 days, a proposal that drew complaints from a raft of Fortune 500
companies.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies were afraid that if the deadline was shortened too
much, it would impact their ability to get out accurate reports,"
said Caroline Graves Hurley, tax counsel with AeA, a Washington trade
group for technology companies. "I don't think this will crunch
companies too badly."</TE>
<TE>   The Securities Industry Assn., which had expressed grave concerns
to the SEC in May about the new deadlines, also was satisfied with
the final rule.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that the SEC has taken our concerns into account," said
Margaret Draper, an SIA spokeswoman. "We did point out there had to
be a balance between the speed of getting the information and
companies' ability to produce accurate information. We are optimistic
that this will provide that balance."</TE>
<TE>   However, the bigger change affects how quickly company insiders
must report their stock trades. Starting Thursday, insider stock
transactions will have to be reported within two business days, the
SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, companies weren't required to file a report with the
SEC until 10 days following the month in which an executive officer,
director or major shareholder bought or sold the company's stock.
That could create a 40-day lag between the transaction and reporting
date. And if the shares were sold back to the company, an executive
could wait until 45 days after the end of the company's fiscal year
before reporting the sale.</TE>
<TE>   Critics complained that the time lag allowed executives to profit
by quietly selling company shares even as their companies were
collapsing. Former Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay waited until
February to report that he had sold $70 million in stock back to the
energy trading company as it slid into bankruptcy in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors track stock transactions by corporate executives
for clues to how insiders view their company's prospects.</TE>
<TE>   In the next few months, the SEC will consider another rule that
would require companies to file their insider-transaction reports
electronically, as the agency currently does with many other types of
reports filed by publicly traded companies. That rule would help the
SEC staff cope with the flood of insider-trading reports, which total
about 200,000 annually.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC also is studying ways to use information from
electronically filed reports to analyze trading patterns at
individual companies, agency officials said.</TE>
<TE>   All of the new rules would apply to any company required to file
reports with U.S. securities regulators, including mutual funds and
foreign firms listed on U.S. exchanges, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   The agency also provided details of what it will expect of
officers with respect to "certifying" their financial statements. The
SEC said the principal executive and financial officer of each
company must state in writing that they have personally reviewed the
company's financial statements and believe the statements to be
accurate.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, officers and directors will be held personally
responsible for setting up procedures to ensure that any material
information about the company's finances is reported up the chain of
command, so top officers can't claim ignorance when their companies
disintegrate beneath them.</TE>
<TE>   The new SEC rules regarding certification, accelerated filing
deadlines and quicker disclosure of insider transactions implement
portions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which was passed last month in an
effort to restore investor confidence after scandals at Enron,
WorldCom Inc. and other companies.</TE>
<TE>   "We are determined to give real teeth and meaning to the
protections of the new law," SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt said at the
meeting. "We have a large job ahead of us."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's meeting was the first in more than two years with the
SEC's full complement of five members. Four members were confirmed by
the Senate last month, joining Pitt on the commission.</TE>
<TE>   The vacancies on the SEC board had raised concerns when some
commission actions were challenged on the ground that the group
lacked a quorum.</TE>
<TE>   Reuters and Bloomberg News were used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia Seeks to Curb Rigases</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp. asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to stop
its founder from selling property that the cable television systems
owner said is at least partly owned by the company.</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia said that John J. Rigas and other family members had a
"pattern of using Adelphia's funds to purchase and maintain their
real estate assets" and that the company probably owned an interest
in "any parcel of real property in which the Rigases claim an
interest and seek to liquidate."</LD>
<LD>   At least one property is under contract for sale, according to
documents filed late Monday in Bankruptcy Court in New York.</LD>
<TE>   Attorneys for the Rigases didn't return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia filed a civil complaint July 24 accusing the Rigases of
conspiring to use company funds for their own benefit and filing
false financial statements that didn't reveal those transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Rigas, 77, and two sons were arrested July 24 on charges of
stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from the cable company.</TE>
<TE>   An Adelphia employee said in a declaration accompanying Monday's
motion that he had been informed that John Rigas had contracted to
sell a property in Hilton Head Island, S.C., for $560,000 and was
preparing to sell properties in Roslyn, N.Y.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Worldwide to Settle Enron Lawsuits</HD>
<DH>Courts: The umbrella group is the first defendant to settle
in a pair of class actions. It will pay $40 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTEN HAYS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Andersen Worldwide, the international umbrella organization that
includes auditing firm Arthur Andersen, has agreed to pay $40 million
to settle lawsuits from Enron Corp. investors and employees.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement, announced Tuesday, is the first to emerge from a
$25-billion lawsuit filed on behalf of Enron investors, led by the
University of California, and another lawsuit filed by former
employees in the aftermath of the failed energy company's swift
collapse last year in a swirl of accounting scandals.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen Worldwide serves as the coordinating entity for the
international network of Andersen firms.</LD>
<TE>   Arthur Andersen, its Chicago-based U.S. arm, remains a defendant
in the suit.</TE>
<TE>   "We regard this settlement only as a first step in obtaining
recovery for the class, and will continue to pursue damages from the
remaining defendants, most of whom had far deeper involvement in the
Enron debacle than the overseas Andersen firms," said James E. Holst,
general counsel for the university.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Lloyd, an attorney with Sidley Austin Brown &amp; Wood in Chicago
who helped negotiate the settlement, declined to comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton also declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement is subject to approval by U.S. District Judge
Melinda Harmon in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   The university said the $40-million settlement includes $15
million that will be available to pay for costs associated with the
suit, but not attorney fees in the litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Robin Harrison, one of the attorneys who represents employees,
said lawyers haven't yet determined how to distribute the money.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen Worldwide denied any liability or wrongdoing with regard
to Enron, the university said.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Andersen Worldwide said Arthur Andersen, which was
Enron's outside auditor for 16 years until it was fired in January,
was the only proper defendant in claims relating to audits of faulty
financial statements.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. arm, like other offices around the world, operates
autonomously from the umbrella organization, Andersen Worldwide said.</TE>
<TE>   "This first settlement recovers millions of dollars for the class
and demonstrates that even relatively minor actors may face
substantial liability to Enron's investors," said Bill Lerach, the
lead plaintiff's attorney in the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Andersen was convicted in June of obstruction of justice as
investigators were looking into Enron's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   The crippled firm has lost hundreds of clients and offices
throughout the U.S. and other countries.</TE>
<TE>   The firm, which has said it expects to formally end any remaining
audit business next week, will be sentenced by Harmon on Oct. 17.</TE>

<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>MGM Mirage, the No. 2 U.S. casino company, will spend $375 million to
add a 925-room tower to the Bellagio casino, its most profitable
property.</LD>
<LD>   Construction will begin in mid-2003 and is scheduled for
completion in December 2004. The tower will be on the south side of
the casino's main pool and courtyard.</LD>
<LD>   The building of the tower is in response to rival casino
companies' plans. Mandalay Resort Group, for example, has announced
that it will open a $200-million hotel tower at its Mandalay Bay
casino next year.</LD>
<TE>   And in June, Steve Wynn, the former chief executive of Mirage

<HD>Sony Finally Throws the Betamax on Scrapheap</HD>
<DH>Technology: Production will end this year. 'Betaphiles'
still swear by the format's quality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like a grieving widow who finally parts with her late husband's golf
clubs, Sony Corp. has given up on Betamax.</LD>
<LD>   The Japanese electronics giant announced Tuesday that it would
stop making the last two models of the Betamax videocassette recorder
by year's end. The company made fewer than 3,000 of the VCRs last
year and sold them only in Japan.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Betamax format was technically superior, it was
quickly overrun by the rival VHS format, which captured more than 75%
of the consumer market by the early 1980s. The Betamax brand name has
since come to symbolize the limited power of good engineering in
consumer electronics--the best technology doesn't always win.</LD>
<TE>   The announcement was merely a formality for consumers in the
United States. Betamax VCRs disappeared from U.S. store shelves at
least a decade ago, as did most Betamax tapes.</TE>
<TE>   Still, an underground community of "Betaphiles" lives on, buying
and refurbishing used machines, scrounging around for parts and
ordering tapes of movies made before George Clooney's first hit.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Korpsak is one of a handful of merchants devoted to sustaining
the Betamax community. A Betaphile himself, Korpsak started Absolute
Beta Products and VCRs in Remington, Va., 10 years ago after he
landed a cache of 2,000 Betamax movie tapes at an auction.</TE>
<TE>   Now Korpsak sells reconditioned units, supplies and prerecorded
tapes to about 1,000 customers a year. He also repairs 200 to 300
machines a year for consumers, many of whom are referred to him by
Sony's service centers.</TE>
<TE>   "They keep telling their customers they don't have the parts,"
Korpsak said.</TE>
<TE>   Why do Betaphiles cling to a format that most consumers abandoned
long ago?</TE>
<TE>   Some have large libraries of tapes that they don't want or can't
afford to convert to VHS or disc, including home movies.</TE>
<TE>   Others swear by the picture and sound quality, which they say is
far better than VHS. Betamax machines crammed more information onto
videotape than the initial VHS models, enabling them to record more
detailed pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Advances in VHS technology, however, have narrowed or even closed
that gap in quality, experts say. And the arrival of DVD, with even
better picture quality, has "basically put Betamax to rest or out to
pasture," said David J. Migdal, a spokesman for Sony Electronics.</TE>
<TE>   The VHS format also had one critical advantage: VHS cassettes were
larger and the tape moved more slowly across the recording heads,
enabling much longer recordings on a single videotape. And although
its inventor, JVC, didn't bring VHS to the market until a year after
Betamax debuted in 1975, it lined up more allies and distributors
than Sony did.</TE>
<TE>   Betamax sales hit their peak in 1984, when 2.3 million recorders
were sold, the Associated Press reported. But its rivals already were
dominating the market, and by 1988 Sony effectively conceded defeat
and began selling VHS recorders.</TE>
<TE>   It's not surprising that Sony stuck with the technology long after
it was abandoned by every other major consumer electronics company,
including Toshiba Corp., Sanyo Electric Co. and Zenith Electronics
Corp. The company has a history of sticking with the formats it
invents, such as MiniDisc and MemoryStick, even as competitors
gravitate to other standards.</TE>
<TE>   The recorders' main legacy may be the landmark Supreme Court
ruling in the 1984 Sony Betamax case. The court rejected Hollywood
studios' attempt to block Betamax sales on piracy grounds, saying
consumers had the right to record TV shows for later viewing.</TE>
<TE>   About 18 million Betamax machines have been sold worldwide, and
Korpsak estimates that 100,000 consumers in the United States still
use them. For the last several years, the only new Betamax machines
available have been for high-end consumers--the last two models sell
in Japan for about $750 and $2,050, Migdal said.</TE>
<TE>   Used machines can be found online for $10 or less, although a
reconditioned, working unit from Surplus Traders in Alburg, Vt., will
cost $1,000 or more, said store owner Marvin Birnbom. "I'm surprised
myself at the interest in it, but not necessarily the sales," Birnbom
said, explaining that most callers lose their ardor when they hear
the price.</TE>
<TE>   The last Hollywood studio that routinely put out movies on Betamax
tapes, Korpsak said, was Walt Disney Co.'s Buena Vista, which
abandoned the format in the mid-1990s. After that, Paramount would
put a movie out on Betamax for orders of 20 or more, Korpsak said,
but "they stopped that a couple of years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the lack of fresh supplies, Absolute Beta still has a
library of tens of thousands of Betamax tapes, Korpsak said. Much of
his stock is older films that are no longer available in any format,
he said, adding, "I suspect at some time we'll become [an archive]
like the Library of Congress."</TE>

<HD>Union Urges Refusal of Boeing Offer</HD>
<DH>Labor: The contract proposal is called 'unacceptable.' The
machinists could strike as early as next week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER ROBISON</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Boeing Co.'s machinists may go out on strike next week, halting
airliner production at the world's biggest plane maker, after union
leaders Tuesday urged members to reject the company's proposal for a
new three-year contract. The current contract expires Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Boeing's final offer of a 20% boost in pensions wasn't enough, and
new health-care premiums would add $10,000 in costs for some members,
said the International Assn. of Machinists, which represents 25,000
Boeing workers at plants in Washington state, Oregon and Kansas.</LD>
<LD>   Boeing also didn't offer job security guarantees the union wanted.</LD>
<TE>   Boeing's 20% offer on pension benefits, however, was more than its
initial proposal of 12%. And while the company also is offering to
give workers a higher bonus if they approve the contract, it also is
proposing new shop-floor rules that the union has said could send
jobs to outside companies.</TE>
<TE>   The offer "appears to be unacceptable on every point," said Matt
Bates, a spokesman for the International Assn. of Machinists.</TE>
<TE>   The machinists are scheduled to vote Thursday and would strike
Monday if the offer is rejected. Should that happen, it would be
Boeing's second walkout since 2000 and comes at a time when many
airlines, reeling with losses, have pressed for delivery delays.</TE>
<TE>   The workers, with an average age of 46 and a salary of $50,000,
have said they're most concerned with boosting retirement benefits
and getting new job protections. The union called for a doubling in
pension benefits and wanted the company to guarantee a minimum of
jobs tied to annual deliveries.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing has said it can't guarantee work.</TE>
<TE>   In a summary of the contract proposal, the company said it would
pledge not to lay off any employees as a result of subcontracting. It
also proposed rules that would let outside contractors install parts
within Boeing's factories, something union negotiators say would cost
hundreds of jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing also said it would raise the signing bonus in the
contract's first year to 8% and boost wages 2% in the second year and
2.5% in the third year. The initial proposal was for a 6% signing
bonus and a 2.5% wage increase in each of the contract's last two
years.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Boeing rose 14 cents to $37.03 on the New York Stock
Exchange. They have fallen 30% in the last year.</TE>

<HD>Analysts Expect Corporate Debt Sales to Rise</HD>
<DH>Credit: Investors are starting to show strong interest in
bonds as confidence grows and summer vacation ends.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oncor Electric Delivery Co. on Tuesday doubled its bond sale to $1
billion from $500 million, a sign that strong investor demand may
lead to a flurry of new corporate debt sales starting next week.</LD>
<LD>   Investment-grade corporate bond offerings last week topped $16
billion, the most since January, as a rebounding stock market gave
investors more confidence to take a chance on company debt.</LD>
<LD>   While there have been just three new sales this week, totaling
$2.3 billion, analysts expect bond issuance to pick up next week when
many investors and corporate treasurers return from summer vacation.</LD>
<TE>   "With stability in the equity market and pent-up demand from
investors, we expect a ... frenzy post-Labor Day," said Peter Petas,
analyst at CreditSights Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "Conditions have improved to the point where companies that might
have had to sit on the sidelines in July have been able to tap the
market," said Steve Nelson, who invests about $2.5 billion for
Advantus Capital Management in St. Paul, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   Oncor, the gas-and power-delivery unit of TXU Corp., the
fifth-largest U.S. utility owner, sold $800 million of 20-year bonds
with a coupon, or annual interest rate, of 7%, and $200 million of
five-year notes with a 5% coupon.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, U.S. Treasury bonds maturing in 20 years yield about
5.15%, and Treasuries maturing in five years yield 3.35%.</TE>
<TE>   The corporate bond market nearly shut down early in August, as
fearful investors were reluctant to take on even modest credit risk.
Since then yields have declined as more buyers have stepped up.
Assuming the economy continues to recover, many analysts argue that
corporate yields are attractive, especially compared with Treasuries.</TE>
<TE>   Yields on the highest-risk bonds--corporate junk issues--also have
declined recently. The KDP Investment Advisors yield on an index of
100 junk issues was at 11.53% on Tuesday, down from 11.62% on Monday
and the lowest since July 17.</TE>
<TE>   A government report Tuesday showed orders for durable goods surged
8.7% in July. That helped buoy optimism about the corporate sector's
recovery.</TE>
<TE>   The durable-goods number "throws cold water on the notion that
we're headed for a double-dip recession," said Michael Ryan, chief
fixed-income strategist at UBS PaineWebber. "That's constructive for
corporate credit."</TE>

<LD>Bassett Furniture Industries Inc. said it will close a Los Angeles
upholstery plant and eliminate 200 jobs, or 6% of its workers, to cut
costs. The Bassett, Va.-based furniture maker said it will move
production to more efficient plants in Newton and Hiddenite, N.C.*
BNC Mortgage Inc. will move its Irvine headquarters to another office
building in one of the largest leases this year in the commercial
district near John Wayne Airport. The residential mortgage lender
rented 63,000 square feet from Koll Development Co. at 1901 Main St.
in a six-year deal valued at about $10 million, Koll said. BNC will
move in December. The eight-story office building at Main Street and
MacArthur Boulevard opened in 2001 and now is 94% leased.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Semtech Corp., a maker of semiconductors for major technology
companies, said a customer claims it has suffered $42 million in
damages because faulty chips caused some products to fail, and the
damages could reach more than $115 million.</LD>
<LD>   Camarillo-based Semtech said its tests indicate the chips do not
malfunction and it is in talks aimed at resolving the dispute. A
company spokesman couldn't be reached for comment.</LD>
<LD>   Semtech said the customer, whose identity was not disclosed, is
expected to account for about 1% of its sales this quarter. Semtech
provides chips to such companies as Cisco Systems Inc., Dell Computer
Corp. and Intel Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Semtech also reported second-quarter net income of $11.1 million,
or 14 cents a share, contrasted with a year-ago net loss of $5.1
million, or 7 cents, that included one-time charges of $1 million.
Sales jumped 28% to $40.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Semtech shares fell as much as 14% to $16.25 in extended trading
on the news, after closing down 98 cents at $18.92 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Incentives May Bring Car Plant to Southland</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Santa Monica start-up that proposes to build cars on demand for
individual consumers, much as Dell Computer Corp. operates, said
Tuesday that it has been offered a $53-million package of private and
government incentives to build an auto assembly plant in San
Bernardino.</LD>
<LD>   No decision has been made on the offer, but William S. Li, a
former Ford Motor Co. executive and co-founder of Build-To-Order
Inc., said the firm's executives "are working hard to make California
a viable, logical place for us to be."</LD>
<LD>   The offer consists of $23 million in tax incentives from the state
and a $30-million construction financing deal from Ross Perot Jr.'s
commercial development firm Hillwood Development Corp., which is
proposing a 2,000-acre business park on the site of the former Norton
Air Force Base.</LD>
<TE>   Li, BTO's president and chief executive, said the 2-year-old
company has acquired rights to the Auburn automobile brand name and
intends to launch two Auburn vehicles--a sport sedan and a station
wagon--by early 2005.</TE>
<TE>   The company's business plan calls for the vehicles to be built on
order, so there is no costly inventory.</TE>
<TE>   The sedan and wagon would use common components, or
platforms--supplied by automobile parts vendors--to minimize costs.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota Motor Corp. and General Motors Corp. jointly operate an
auto manufacturing plant in Northern California, but the last major
assembly factory in Southern California was shuttered by GM in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people in the auto industry view California as hostile
to the business," Li said. "These offers show that's not the case."</TE>
<TE>   He said the company still is negotiating with the state over
job-training support.</TE>
<TE>   BTO has spent about $40 million on development of its new
automobiles, Li said. The company's equity partners include AK Steel
Corp., Deloitte Consulting, British race car manufacturer TWR Group
Ltd. and SHR Perceptual Management, a brand-development firm.</TE>

helped in a scheme to inflate revenue at the once-highflying dot-com.</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission's complaint, alleging
financial fraud for fiscal year 2000, named Jonathan Beck and Kevin
Clark, former sales vice presidents at Critical Path, as well as
William Rinehart, former head of the San Francisco-based e-mail
provider's North American and Latin American sales forces.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. attorney's office in Northern California also filed
separate criminal charges of securities fraud against Beck and Clark.
If found guilty, Beck and Clark each face up to 10 years in prison
and fines of $1 million apiece.</LD>
<TE>   Critical Path fired Beck in February 2001 and Clark resigned
around the same time, according to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Rinehart and Clark have agreed to settle the SEC charges without
admitting or denying them, but together will pay fines of almost
$500,000, the agency said. Rinehart also agreed to a five-year ban on
acting as an officer or director of a public company.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the defendants did not immediately return calls for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC alleged that Rinehart ordered his sales force to arrange
transactions, some fake, that allowed the firm to book about $6.3
million of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Beck participated in one of the fake transactions, for which
Critical Path improperly recorded revenue of $2.13 million, the SEC
alleged.</TE>
<TE>   Clark was alleged to have been involved in deals that resulted in
improper records of another $2.15 million in revenue. Beck and Clark
were also charged with insider trading of Critical Path stock during
the financial fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Critical Path, with its electronic messaging systems that allowed
other companies to outsource their e-mail needs, was once a Wall
Street darling. It went public in March 1999 and saw its shares trade
as high as $150.25.</TE>
<TE>   Under new management and recently unburdened of its large debt,
the firm's stock Tuesday fell 2 cents to 86 cents on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Improper accounting practices were exposed in January 2001, when
the company reduced 2000 revenue by about $19.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   The company's former president, David Thatcher, earlier this year
pleaded guilty to securities fraud and admitted that he participated
in a criminal conspiracy with other top officers to inflate company
revenue to meet performance targets. Thatcher has been helping
authorities build cases against other former Critical Path insiders.</TE>
<TE>   Timothy Ganley, the company's ex-vice president of strategic
sales, pleaded guilty in April to insider trading.</TE>
<TE>   Both men have also settled fraudulent accounting charges brought
by the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said its investigation of the fraud continues. The company
already has settled allegations of fraudulent accounting with the
SEC, without admitting or denying the charges.</TE>

<HD>Consumer Confidence Falls to 9-Month Low in August</HD>
<DH>Economy: Drop is the third straight monthly decline.
Durable goods demand surges in July.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNINE AVERSA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Consumer confidence in the American economy sank to a nine-month low
in August, the third straight monthly decline. Yet in July, demand
surged for big-ticket durable goods such as cars and computers.</LD>
<LD>   The latest batch of economic news Tuesday offered mixed signals to
the economy's direction and suggested that although consumers may be
growing more nervous, business might be feeling a little better,
analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   Still, it is the actions of consumers and businesses--their
willingness or reluctance to spend and invest in the months
ahead--that will shape the recovery. Optimists are betting that
consumers will keep their wallets open and that businesses will
slowly step up investment. Pessimists worry that they won't.</LD>
<TE>   "It seems the economy is at an inflection point, a turning point,
where it either picks up momentum from the second quarter or loses
momentum," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist for Banc of America
Capital Management.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board, a private research group, reported that its
index of consumer confidence fell to 93.5 in August, the lowest level
since November, from a revised 97.4 in July. The showing, much weaker
than the 97 reading analysts forecast, raised questions about
consumers' appetite for spending in coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "For the economy to start accelerating sharply, consumer
confidence will have to start improving," said economist Joel Naroff
of Naroff Economic Advisors.</TE>
<TE>   The index is used by economists to gauge the behavior of
consumers, whose spending accounts for two-thirds of economic
activity in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Confidence fell in June and July, but retail sales posted solid
gains in those months as free-financing offers, especially on cars,
and other incentives motivated buyers. Home sales in July also were
strong, helped by low mortgage rates.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, orders to U.S. factories for costly manufactured
durable goods jumped 8.7% in July, the largest gain since October,
suggesting that businesses felt more optimistic about the appetite
for their products. The advance came after a 4.5% drop in June.</TE>
<TE>   July's performance was far stronger than analysts had predicted.
Their forecast gains ranged from 1.4% to 2.7%.</TE>
<TE>   The strength in July was broadly based. Orders for cars, trucks
and parts increased a strong 7.5%. Orders for machinery rose by a
record 11.8%. Orders for computers jumped 13.9% and orders for
communications equipment were up 10.4%. That's good news for the
high-tech sector, which was hit hard by last year's recession.</TE>

<HD>CEO of EConnect Indicted in Fraud Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOYZELLE DAVIS</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thomas Hughes, chief executive of EConnect Inc., was indicted by a
federal grand jury Tuesday on charges he attempted to boost the
Internet security company's shares by distributing three false news
releases.</LD>
<LD>   The July releases falsely said that EConnect received a
$20-million investment, was beginning a stock repurchase program and
had received a $964,000 order, according to the U.S. attorney's
office in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   If found guilty, Hughes could face as much as 10 years in prison
for the securities fraud charge and five years on the mail fraud
charge. Hughes also is charged with criminal contempt for allegedly
violating terms of an earlier settlement with securities regulators,
prosecutors said.</LD>
<TE>   Hughes "caused public statements to be made that EConnect was in a
'strong financial position' " when in fact, "as Hughes well knew,
EConnect was not in a strong financial position" and had been unable
to pay employees' salaries, according to the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes, 52, couldn't be reached for comment. He was arrested Aug.
7 and released on a $200,000 bond.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at EConnect also couldn't be reached to comment.</TE>
<TE>   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week,
EConnect said it "believes the charges are unwarranted and intends to
vigorously defend against them."</TE>
<TE>   This is the second time that Hughes has faced charges over issuing
what federal officials said were false news releases. In 2000, Hughes
settled SEC charges by agreeing to abstain from future violations.</TE>
<TE>   EConnect, which sold shares to the public for the first time in
1993, makes a device that it says assures the security of Internet
purchases. It has reported no revenue from operations as of March 31,
while accumulating losses of $167.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The firm commanded a market value of more than $3 billion when its
shares rose to a high of $21.88 on March 9, 2000, after the first set
of news releases the SEC said were false and misleading.</TE>
<TE>   The company claimed then it had business deals with Palm Inc. and
a small Florida broker. The SEC charged that the releases helped
EConnect shares rise to the record level from $1.39 on Feb. 28.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the San Pedro-based company were unchanged at 2 cents in
over-the-counter trading.</TE>
<TE>   Trading of EConnect shares was halted by the SEC from July 25 to
Aug. 8.</TE>

<HD>Enron Puts Top Assets Up for Sale; Move Could Mean
Company's End</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>C. BRYSON HULL</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. put the bulk of its top assets up for sale Tuesday in a
move that, if successful, would rule out its resurrection as a
stripped-down power and pipeline company.</LD>
<LD>   Enron sources acknowledged that the sale of 12 major assets--which
include Oregon-based utility Portland General and Enron's interest in
three major pipelines--would be tantamount to a liquidation.</LD>
<LD>   The sale also will serve the function of deciding whether a
liquidation sale would yield more money for creditors than would the
restructuring proposed by acting Chief Executive Stephen Cooper,
people familiar with the discussions between Enron and its creditors
said.</LD>
<TE>   "Cooper said the assets were worth more as a going concern than
sold separately, and the creditors said, 'Prove it.' This is designed
to see what they're worth," said one of these people, speaking on
condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "But if we get good prices for these, you'd better believe they
would be sold."</TE>
<TE>   Houston-based Enron said it would not sell if the bids came in too
low, a distinct possibility in the depressed environment for utility
assets with the lack of strong buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Final bids for the assets are expected to be due in November,
pending Bankruptcy Court approval.</TE>
<TE>   The sale encompasses about 90% of what is left at the energy
trader, which had plans to be reborn as OpCo Energy Co.</TE>
<TE>   "If all 12 of these things were sold, you wouldn't have an OpCo
left," said another Enron source who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing is maximizing value for the asset. If a sale is
the better value, then the asset is sold."</TE>
<TE>   Cooper has always stated that his main concern was squeezing the
most money he could out of the Enron estate for creditors.</TE>
<TE>   The list of assets for sale includes the Transwestern Pipeline
that extends from west Texas to California, power plants and a small
natural gas exploration and production company.</TE>
<TE>   Enron filed for bankruptcy in December after investor confidence
collapsed amid revelations that it hid billions of dollars of debt
and inflated earnings via a series of questionable off-balance-sheet
transactions.</TE>

<HD>Strike or Not, Baseball as a Business Needs to Improve</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The simple truth is that baseball is not a very good business.</LD>
<LD>   That's the basic problem as major league baseball nears a fateful
strike deadline Friday. If there is a strike, the value of baseball
teams will almost certainly go down.</LD>
<LD>   Yet if negotiators for the players union and team owners reach an
agreement on revenue sharing and other matters, values of leading
teams still could go down because they will be penalized to take care
of weaker clubs in the 30-team major leagues.</LD>
<TE>   A decline in team values would be a terrible turn for the sport.
The chief business attraction of owning a baseball franchise is that
team values generally appreciate. The Anaheim Angels, for example,
have appreciated at more than 10% a year since 1996, when Walt Disney
Co. first bought an interest in the team.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Dodgers rose in value 11.9% a year compounded from
1950, when Walter O'Malley bought the Brooklyn Dodgers, to 1998, when
his son Peter O'Malley sold the team to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.,
according to statistics compiled by Moag &amp; Co., a Baltimore-based
sports evaluation firm.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the Florida Marlins appreciated at only about
5% during the 1990s, which include the year the team won the World
Series. Its owners could have done better in Individual Retirement
Accounts with compound interest.</TE>
<TE>   There are fears today that appreciation could be slowing because
businesspeople don't find baseball, with teams reporting big losses,
an attractive place to invest.</TE>
<TE>   Murdoch is reported to be trying to sell the Dodgers while
retaining the television and cable rights to games. (A spokesman for
News Corp. said Murdoch has said nothing about selling, and his only
recent statement is that he is "thrilled by the improvement in the
team this year." )</TE>
<TE>   Disney has tried to sell the Angels but no big-money buyers with
serious offers have stepped up to the plate.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball is not doomed. In many ways its losses are overstated and
its future could be bright if it could reorganize operations.
Unfortunately, current negotiations may not produce such a beneficial
reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   In current labor talks, as well as those in 1994 that led to the
longest strike in sports history, baseball owners are trying to
achieve a cap on salaries and revenue sharing to foster a competitive
balance among teams.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball is late. The National Football League has had revenue
sharing and salary caps for years. The NFL's overseers realized that
if teams could be kept roughly on a par, competitive games could
become a national television attraction.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball, which plays 162 games a year, is more a sport of local
enthusiasm. Its national TV contracts have never been as large as pro
football's. But baseball never devised a successful policy to
encourage regional television coverage for its teams.</TE>
<TE>   "The Cincinnati Reds used to be televised in Kentucky, but today
nobody sees them or speaks about them," says economist Bruce Johnson
at Centre College in Danville, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   And baseball should have been doing more to ensure competitive
balance. Now it has become a sport of wealthier teams that are able
to hire better players, and other teams that generally have little
hope of making the lucrative postseason playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball is pleading poverty. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig told
Congress that teams collectively are losing more than $500 million.
But normal business accounting, which includes depreciation of
assets, would reduce losses to $150 million at most, says sports
economist Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College in Northampton, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   For example, expensive player contracts offer a tax shelter for
new owners of baseball teams. A buyer may take half the purchase
price of the team as representing player contracts and then amortize
those contracts for tax purposes over five years, gaining a tax
shelter for profit in any other business.</TE>
<TE>   A team's connection with media companies owning cable channels,
such as the Atlanta Braves, Chicago Cubs, Dodgers and New York
Yankees, also changes the profit picture. The team's games add an
attraction that increases the cable channel's earnings, but none of
that profit shows on the baseball team's account.</TE>
<TE>   "The big value in baseball franchises today lies in regional cable
organizations you can create around them," says Michael Mendelsohn,
head of Patriot Advisors Inc., an entertainment industry brokerage in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees and their principal owner, George Steinbrenner, have
organized a lucrative regional sports cable network in the New York
area in recent years. And Steinbrenner has used cable revenue to pay
for star players, making the Yankees a frequent champion in the last
six years.</TE>
<TE>   But this has made him and the Yankees the target of reform. Yankee
revenue should be transferred to San Diego and Kansas City so those
teams can pay star players too, goes the thinking behind the luxury
tax that other owners hope to place on Steinbrenner's payroll. The
Dodgers, as a large-market team, also would have to transfer revenue.</TE>
<TE>   But nothing guarantees that the wealthy owners of small-market
teams such as San Diego and Kansas City would invest shared revenue
to become competitive. They haven't shown much initiative so far.</TE>
<TE>   And no mention is made of the fact that Steinbrenner's Yankees
went 14 years from the early 1980s to the mid-'90s without getting
into postseason play.</TE>
<TE>   What that portends is that even if there is no strike, the
proposed reforms are not likely to cure baseball's ills.</TE>
<TE>   What could do so? Fresh thinking. John Moag, head of the sports
evaluation firm bearing his name, proposes that "100% of all gate
receipts go directly to the home team's player payroll." That would
"establish a meaningful link between the fans and the players they
support," Moag says.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is, baseball could face broadening horizons, with cable
and satellite broadcasting able to target subscribers and attract
advertisers. Also, international markets are opening to baseball as
they may never open to pro football. If baseball can survive this
week, perhaps it can become a good business tomorrow.</TE>

<HD>Funds to Certify Portfolios' Results</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mutual fund companies will be required to certify their portfolios'
financial results, just as corporate executives certify their
companies' results, the Securities and Exchange Commission decided
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC, charged with implementing the Sarbanes-Oxley corporate
governance reform act passed by Congress in July, said it will
require the principal executive and financial officer of every
registered investment company--the technical term for mutual fund
firms--to swear to the accuracy of their semiannual fund reports.</LD>
<LD>   Mutual funds are required to report results twice a year, not
quarterly, as regular corporations must do.</LD>
<TE>   There was some uncertainty as to whether Congress intended to lump
mutual funds in with regular companies on the issue of certification.
The funds, regulated under a 1940 federal law, have enjoyed a
relatively scandal-free reputation because of tight controls over how
they operate.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC decided to include funds in the certification process, but
it also proposed technical amendments to the requirement, reflecting
that funds operate under different rules than regular companies.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC proposed a new form for fund companies to use in
certifying results and asked for fund firms to include "a copy of any
required shareholder report, and information regarding the company's
disclosure controls and procedures."</TE>
<TE>   The SEC asked for comment on the proposed amendments for 30 days.</TE>

<HD>Geron Gains on Cancer Therapy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Geron Corp. on Tuesday won a U.S. patent for technology to develop
immune-system-based cancer therapies, news that sent the
biotechnology company's stock up 15%.</LD>
<LD>   The patent covers Geron technology for stimulating the body's
immune system to attack cancer cells by targeting telomerase, a
protein linked to cancer growth.</LD>
<LD>   The technology may be used to develop vaccines against a wide
range of cancers, the Menlo Park, Calif.-based company said.</LD>
<TE>   "Cancer vaccines are an important development on the horizon, and
this is another potentially very effective way to interrupt
telomerase activity," said David Greenwood, Geron's chief financial
officer.</TE>
<TE>   The approach entails treating cells taken from a patient with
fragments of telomerase. When the cells are given back to the
patient, they stir an immune-system response to attack cancer cells
containing telomerase.</TE>
<TE>   Geron said it is evaluating a telomerase vaccine in early studies
in patients with prostate cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The company also is developing drugs designed to block telomerase
directly.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Geron rose 59 cents to $4.44 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>HealthSouth Shares Plunge Nearly 44%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BIRMINGHAM, Ala.</DL>
<LD>HealthSouth Corp. shares plunged Tuesday after the rehabilitation
giant announced a major reorganization that includes spinning off its
surgery centers into a new public company, warned of lower earnings
and disclosed that founder Richard M. Scrushy is being replaced as
its chief executive.</LD>
<LD>   The move to separate the surgery centers from the company's
rehabilitation services operations was blamed on a reduction in
Medicare reimbursements that prompted HealthSouth to lower its
earnings estimates by $175 million.</LD>
<LD>   The company said it no longer would issue earnings forecasts for
the rest of this year and 2003 because of uncertainties caused by the
Medicare changes.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of HealthSouth plummeted $5.26, or 43.9%, to $6.71 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   HealthSouth is the nation's largest provider of outpatient
surgery, diagnostic imaging and rehabilitation services with about
1,900 locations in all 50 states, Britain, Australia, Puerto Rico and
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The company had revenue of about $4.3 billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   Scrushy, who started the company as a rehabilitation provider 18
years ago, will be replaced as CEO by Bill Owens, president and chief
operating officer.</TE>
<TE>   But Scrushy will continue as chairman of HealthSouth and will be
chairman of the new surgery center company, Surgical Care Affiliates,
which will operate 209 outpatient surgery centers in 37 states.</TE>
<TE>   The new surgical company should have annual revenue of about $1
billion, Scrushy said.</TE>
<TE>   HealthSouth has hired UBS Warburg to help it evaluate other
possible divestitures announced in the restructuring.</TE>
<TE>   Owens was named chief financial officer in 2000, and he became
president and chief operating officer a year ago.</TE>

<HD>Post-Merger HP Reports Net Loss of $2.03 Billion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. on Tuesday reported a $2.03-billion loss for its
fiscal third quarter in its first combined results since buying
Compaq Computer Corp. in the largest technology merger in history, as
sales fell in most of its product lines.</LD>
<LD>   HP's loss amounted to 67 cents a share in the three months ended
July 31. HP said the combined companies would have reported a
year-earlier loss of $116 million, or 4 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   Excluding $2.4 billion in merger costs, investment losses,
litigation expenses and other write-downs, pro forma per-share profit
came to 14 cents for the recent quarter, matching analysts'
predictions.</LD>
<TE>   "We've kept our eye on the ball," Chief Executive Carly Fiorina
told investors and analysts on a conference call. "We did well."</TE>
<TE>   Revenue fell to $16.5 billion from $18.6 billion at the two
companies a year earlier. The latest revenue was shy of Wall Street's
$16.7-billion consensus estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Fiorina and other executives said HP was meeting a variety of
internal goals set before the controversial acquisition of Compaq,
which narrowly survived a shareholder vote. They said the sales
shortfall resulted from continued weakness in technology spending
rather than execution problems or excessive optimism about the merits
of the Compaq acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   Delayed purchases and economic conditions, especially overseas,
put "the information technology sector under enormous pressure,"
Fiorina said. "The shift in buying behavior will continue."</TE>
<TE>   HP stock fell 64 cents to $14.21 on the New York Stock Exchange,
then regained most of that ground after the profit report, moving to
$14.70 in after-hours activity.</TE>
<TE>   The Palo Alto-based company said it was on track to meet earlier
sales and profit forecasts for the year's remaining quarter, and it
said profit margins would improve as it chops more costs. The
executives declined to give a sales forecast for the next fiscal
year.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of printing systems, the most profitable piece of the
company, increased 10% to $4.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   But the rest of the quarter's results were grim. Sales dropped 19%
to $4.8 billion at the HP division handling personal computers for
consumers and business. Revenue from big computer systems sold to
large business enterprises fell 22% to $3.8 billion. And technology
services, touted as a key rationale for the merger, saw sales fall 7%
to $3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "The downside surprise was the enterprise computing," said Merrill
Lynch analyst Steven Milunovich.</TE>
<TE>   "The revenue number was a little light, which suggests that even
since June, the environment has deteriorated a bit," Milunovich said.
He doesn't own HP shares and recommends the stock. Merrill Lynch
provides investment banking services to HP.</TE>
<TE>   HP President Michael Capellas called the big-computer division's
$422-million operating loss "unacceptable" and promised to speed up
cost-cutting moves. The company has eliminated 4,740 jobs and plans
to cut 15,000 by the end of next fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we have a lot of work to do, particularly in our PC and
business enterprise systems," Capellas said. He predicted the
personal-computer division would return to profitability in the first
half of next fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   The big-computer unit suffered the most from overlapping product
lines between HP and Compaq, but other parts of HP also are under
attack by competitors.</TE>
<TE>   Chief PC rival Dell Computer Corp. is targeting more computer
resellers instead of just selling directly to customers. Dell said
this month it plans to sell its own hand-held computers and printers,
where HP is strongest. And IBM Corp., leader in technology
consulting, is buying PricewaterhouseCoopers to boost its strength in
services.</TE>
<TE>   Milunovich noted that HP's first-quarter report card was marred by
economic factors. "They're off to a decent start," he said. "They are
doing a good job controlling what they can control."</TE>

<HD>KPMG's U.S. Firm May Face L&amp;H-Related Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A U.S district judge has ruled that shareholders of speech
recognition firm Lernout &amp; Hauspie could file a suit against
accounting firm KPMG.</LD>
<LD>   The judge for the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts dismissed
cases against KPMG's British, international and Singapore operations
but said the case could go ahead in the U.S. and Belgium.</LD>
<LD>   In a ruling dated Aug. 19 and made available Tuesday, U.S District
Judge Patti Saris said various offices of KPMG in the U.S. and
Belgium were exposed to "an escalating pageant of red flags" in
Lernout &amp; Hauspie's financial statements. Burlington, Mass.-based L&amp;H
filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2000 amid a slew of
accounting scandals.</LD>
<TE>   The judge said KPMG US acted with "recklessness or actual
knowledge" on various occasions including the preparation of Lernout
&amp; Hauspie's annual 2000 financial filing for 1999 with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, KPMG said the allegations were without merit.
"There was massive fraud inside L&amp;H, involving the company's
executives, officers and outside individuals as well as those who
engaged in a concerted effort to defraud both investors and the
auditors," the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Glen DeValerio, a partner in Boston-based Berman DeValerio, which
is representing some of Lernout &amp; Hauspie's shareholders, said the
law firm will seek accounting papers from KPMG relating to its
dealings with the technology company.</TE>

<HD>Tech Shares Lead Broad Retreat; Nasdaq Falls 3.2%</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Drop in consumer confidence, dull outlook from
Intel and retail downgrades push shares lower.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A sharp drop in consumer confidence stifled investors' enthusiasm for
stocks Tuesday, sending the market sharply lower and more than wiping
out Monday's gains. Technology suffered the worst of the selling,
following bearish comments from Intel's chief executive.</LD>
<LD>   Downgrades in the retailing sector also prompted investors to cash
in some profits from Wall Street's five-week winning streak.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 94.60 points, or
1.1%, at 8,824.41. That erased the Dow's 46-point gain from Monday,
but the widely watched market barometer is still up more than 1,100
points from its July 23 closing low of 7,702.34.</LD>
<TE>   The market's broader gauges also retreated. The tech-laden Nasdaq
composite index fell 43.96 points, or 3.2%, to 1,347.78 and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index declined 13.13 points, or 1.4%, to
934.82.</TE>
<TE>   Losers beat winners by 5 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange and
by more than 2 to 1 on Nasdaq. Trading volume was up from recent
sessions but still modest, following the usual late-August pattern on
Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Investors were disheartened by a report from the Conference Board
that its consumer confidence index fell to 93.5 from a revised 97.4
in July. Analysts had been expecting a reading of 97.0.</TE>
<TE>   That bad news erased the Dow's early 98-point gain, which came
after a government report that durable goods orders surged 8.7% in
July--the largest increase in nine months and far better than
analysts' expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Still, analysts deemed Tuesday's batch of economic news to be
mostly positive because consumers have remained rather strong
throughout the economic downturn. The durable goods orders are a
greater indication that the economy is recovering, not slipping back
into recession, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "The consumer remains OK, just not as OK," said Brian Belski,
fundamental market strategist at US Bancorp Piper Jaffray. "The
broader news is durable goods orders, and that at least provides some
cushion relative to the double-dip [recession] worries."</TE>
<TE>   The durable goods report pushed up yields on longer-term Treasury
securities as chances lessened that the Federal Reserve will cut
interest rates any time soon. The yield on the benchmark 10-year
Treasury note rose to 4.28% from 4.23% on Monday. The yield on the
two-year T-note rose to 2.23% from 2.16% ahead of today's $27-billion
auction of the securities.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar had its biggest drop in seven weeks against the yen and
fell against the euro.</TE>
<TE>   * Intel fell 95 cents to $17.18 following downbeat remarks by CEO
Craig Barrett. Barrett said he expects modest growth in third-quarter
earnings, but said capital spending in the computing sector continues
to lag behind.</TE>
<TE>   Other tech stocks fell, including Dell Computer, down 73 cents at
$27.15. Hewlett-Packard declined 64 cents to $14.21 ahead of its

fell nearly 2%.</TE>
<TE>   * Target, also lowered by Merrill, fell 79 cents to $35. The No. 3
U.S. discount chain late Monday said sales at its stores open at
least a year fell below plan again last week.</TE>
<TE>   * HealthSouth slumped $5.26, or 44%, to $6.71. The health-care
company, the day's biggest percentage loser and the NYSE's most
actively traded stock, said Tuesday it plans to split in two to
shield its strong surgery center division from expected earnings
weakness in its rehabilitation services. Morgan Stanley's index of
health-care provider stocks fell 5.3%, with all 14 members losing
ground.</TE>
<TE>   * Gainers included some makers of durable goods. Whirlpool rose 72

<HD>Port Talks Resume as Sides Take Potshots</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Contract negotiations between West Coast dockworkers and shipping
lines resumed Tuesday in San Francisco, with officials from both
sides aiming potshots at each other over a union proposal for port
security.</LD>
<LD>   The bargaining session was only the second since late July, and
both sides acknowledged that they made little headway on the
thorniest issue: how to incorporate labor-saving technology and make
the docks run more efficiently without gutting union jobs.</LD>
<LD>   The International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which represents
10,500 dockworkers at 29 West Coast ports, raised the issue of
security, which has come under heightened scrutiny since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks. Accusing the shipping lines of carrying cargo for
countries suspected of sponsoring terrorism, union President James
Spinosa called on terminal operators to work with the union to make
the ports more secure.</LD>
<TE>   One of the ILWU's proposals would require union members to
visually inspect the seals placed across the doors of all loaded
shipping containers for possible tampering and to verify that each
container is accompanied by the proper paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the ships that come to our ports are foreign-owned, and
we cannot control where they have been or who has handled the cargo,"
Spinosa said in a statement. "In an era when shippers ... engage in a
high volume of business with countries such as Iraq and Libya, which
our government considers state sponsors of international terrorism,
it is impossible to rely on overseas inspections."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents the
shipping lines, called the union's security proposal "disingenuous."
He noted that the ILWU has opposed a number of initiatives to tighten
port security, including proposed federal legislation that would
require dockworkers to undergo background checks.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Suite, contract administrator for the PMA, said his
organization has been working closely with the Customs Service, the
Transportation Department, the Coast Guard and other federal
agencies. He said shippers would abide with whatever requirements
they come up with for securing the nation's ports, something that
can't be settled in union bargaining.</TE>
<TE>   "The real issues here are not security," Suite said. "The real
issues here are the economics of settling the contract." The contract
expired July 1, but work has continued as the union and shipping
lines have repeatedly extended the old agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Ports from San Diego to Seattle move more than $300 billion worth
of goods a year, accounting for about 7% of the nation's gross
domestic product and supporting 1.4 million American jobs.</TE>

<HD>Group Has Answer for Gas-Price Volatility</HD>
<DH>Energy: Restricting sales to a single grade could free up
space for reserves to cushion against spikes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A consumer group in Santa Monica is proposing a novel solution to
chronic gasoline price spikes in California: sell only regular
gasoline.</LD>
<LD>   Stations lacking premium and mid-grade gasolines probably would
draw protests from owners of luxury vehicles and clunkers alike who
need the extra octane to keep their cars moving.</LD>
<LD>   But going to a single grade with an octane rating of 87 or 88
would free up storage space that the state could employ as a publicly
owned strategic fuel reserve to cushion against higher prices,
according to a study to be released today by the Foundation for
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.</LD>
<TE>   The study, conducted for the group by a gasoline industry
consultant, accused refiners of keeping fuel prices high in the
relatively isolated California market by keeping inventories low. The
companies use publicly available data to keep tabs on one another's
refining levels, the report said, and the tactics do not violate
antitrust laws.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't need a smoke-filled room," said Jamie Court, FTCR's
executive director. "All you have to do is follow the leader and you
can control the market."</TE>
<TE>   The study contends that California drivers last year would have
saved 16 cents per gallon, or $2.8 billion, if such a reserve had
existed. For those motorists whose vehicles require higher-octane
gasoline, the study advises buying fuel additives.</TE>
<TE>   FTCR's study points to inventories as a key problem in
California's gasoline market, which is dominated by six large
companies.</TE>
<TE>   "All of those refiners know that if inventories go up too high,
then the prices get too low and all of them know that if inventories
get too low, they get gas lines," said Tim Hamilton, a consultant
from Olympia, Wash., who spent two years on the FTCR report.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton and Court were members of California Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer's gasoline task force in 2000. It recommended creating a
strategic fuel reserve to cushion against price spikes or the
construction of pipelines to bring gasoline into California.</TE>
<TE>   The advocacy group is calling on the state Legislature to come up
with a law mandating a single fuel grade and setting up the strategic
reserve.</TE>
<TE>   California's motorists already are required to use the nation's
cleanest-burning gasoline, and the fuel is produced by few refineries
outside the state.</TE>
<TE>   About 25% of retail fuel purchases last year were of mid-grade and
premium gasoline, according to statistics from the federal Energy
Information Administration. Hamilton, however, contends that 95% to
97% of cars can operate correctly on a lower octane fuel, based on a
study conducted by AAA.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton estimates that 50% of the storage space devoted to
premium gas is not effectively used, and eliminating the higher
grades would create instant storage space at gasoline stations and
fuel terminals for a state-run strategic fuel reserve that could be
tapped when prices soar.</TE>
<TE>   But Steve Mazor, chief auto engineer for the Automobile Club of
Southern California, thinks the consumer group's plan is a bad one.
Drivers who require higher-octane fuels would not only be
inconvenienced by having to purchase bottle after bottle of fuel
additives, their safety also could be threatened by carrying the
volatile additives in their cars, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You're talking 2 1/2 million people with a potential bomb in
their trunks," said Mazor, who noted that the effectiveness of some
gasoline additives has been questioned.</TE>
<TE>   John Felmy, chief economist with the American Petroleum Institute,
said a government reserve could worsen inventory levels if oil
refiners saw less need to hold costly reserves.</TE>
<TE>   "You could see government reserves crowding out the private
reserves," Felmy said.</TE>
<TE>   Felmy also disputed the group's allegations that oil companies are
manipulating inventories to keep prices high, saying that supply,
demand and competition dictate prices.</TE>
<TE>   "The oil industry has been the subject of dozens of investigations
over the years, and they all have exonerated us," Felmy said.</TE>
<TE>   The octane number represents the anti-knock properties of
gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   Older and higher-performance cars typically use higher-octane
fuels to prevent the engine from knocking, or "pinging."</TE>
<TE>   The study's release came as Southern Californians were getting a
firsthand look at oil economics in action: Wholesale gasoline prices
have jumped since Friday because a fire at the BP refinery in Carson
shut down two coker units, which process fuel oil, a byproduct of the
gasoline refining process, into coke.</TE>
<TE>   Prices on the street already are reacting and could rise 4 cents
to 10 cents per gallon at the pump, said Bob Van Der Valk, bulk fuels
manager at Cosby Oil Co. of Santa Fe Springs, an independent fuel
distributor.</TE>
<TE>   Wholesale gasoline prices ended Tuesday at 89.5 cents per gallon
in Los Angeles, he said. Taxes add 48 cents to the wholesale price.</TE>
<TE>   "On Thursday and Friday, everyone will be going out to buy
gasoline, and they're going to wonder what happened," Van Der Valk
said.</TE>
<TE>   Price increases probably will linger even after refinery repairs
by BP, which owns the Arco and Thrifty brands, because of the annual
changeover of production to winter gasoline and stubbornly high oil
prices, he said.</TE>
<TE>   BP spokesman Walter Neil said the coker units were not damaged,
but the refinery's gasoline production has been temporarily reduced
as a result.</TE>
<TE>   Inventories in California are sufficient to meet demand, he said,
attributing rising wholesale prices to market speculation.</TE>

<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Sales at U.S. chain stores fell last week as stock market losses
and concerns over a shaky economic recovery prompted consumers to
stash their money away, two published reports showed.</LD>
<TE>   Retail sales tend to mirror broader patterns of consumer spending,
which accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, so
analysts pay close attention to the industry's performance.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at the nation's chain stores fell 0.3% in the week ended
Aug. 24--the third straight weekly drop--after a 0.8% decline the
week before, according to a report published jointly by Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi and UBS Warburg.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Instinet Research's gauge of sales performance, the
Redbook Average, slipped a sharp 1.6% during the first three retail
calendar weeks of August compared with the same period in July, the
company said.</TE>
<TE>   Retailers are hoping back-to-school sales, which come second only
to Christmas as chain stores' most profitable season, will get cash
registers ringing again.</TE>
<TE>   A survey of business leaders across a wide array of U.S.
industries, published separately by the International Strategy and
Investment Group, found continued strong demand for homes and cars
propping up the economy.</TE>
<TE>   But the report also described weak retail sector activity and
disappointing demand for back-to-school merchandise.</TE>

<LD>   Mercedes-Benz will use its Tuscaloosa County, Ala., plant to build
a vehicle described as a combination of sport utility vehicle,
station wagon and touring car.</LD>
<TE>   The DaimlerChrysler subsidiary said production will begin in late
2004 of the Vision Grand Sports Tourer, unveiled as a design concept
in January at the North American Auto Show in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   The prototype on display was a six-passenger, 15-foot-long vehicle
with a 5.5-liter V-8 engine. It featured 22-inch tires, butterfly
side doors and a glass roof that becomes tinted at the touch of a
button.</TE>
<TE>   The Alabama plant is undergoing a $600-million expansion that will
double the number of employees to 4,000 as it doubles production.</TE>

<LD>   Nortel Networks Ltd. said it will cut 7,000 more jobs, or 17% of
its staff, and third-quarter revenue will miss forecasts because of a
decline in spending on equipment by U.S. telephone companies.</LD>
<TE>   North America's second-biggest maker of telephone gear will reduce
its work force to 35,000 by the end of the year, compared with a
previous target of 42,000 by the end of September. Third-quarter
sales will fall as much as 10% from the second quarter's $2.77
billion. Last month Nortel said revenue would be roughly unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   Sales are falling because some network operators such as Global
Crossing Ltd. have filed for bankruptcy protection while survivors
such as Sprint Corp. are cutting spending to preserve cash. Nortel
said the reductions will let it return to profit, excluding certain
expenses, with $2.6 billion in revenue, down from an earlier target
of $3.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Brampton, Canada-based Nortel fell 6 cents to $1.23 on

to buy about 80% of the leasing and loan portfolio held by ABB's
structured-finance subsidiary. It cited unidentified people familiar

<HD>Lucent CEO, Chairman Purchase More Shares</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lucent Technologies Inc. Chief Executive Patricia Russo bought shares
in the telephone-equipment maker for the first time since taking the
job in January, adding to her stake as the stock traded near
historical lows.</LD>
<LD>   Russo purchased 350,000 shares Aug. 16 for $497,000 to $500,500,
at $1.42 or $1.43 a share, Lucent said, bringing her total to 713,400
shares.</LD>
<LD>   Chairman Henry Schacht, who preceded Russo as CEO, bought 1
million shares that day at $1.43 each, adding to the 3,700 he already
owned. It was his first stock purchase since October 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, Chief Operating Officer Robert Holder and Director
Robert Denham also bought Lucent stock.</TE>
<TE>   Holder purchased 150,000 shares on Aug. 19 at $1.44 each. He now
owns 531,957 shares.</TE>
<TE>   Denham, a partner in the law firm of Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson and
former CEO of Salomon Inc., bought 40,000 shares on the same day at
$1.47 each. Denham, who joined Lucent's board in May, owns 65,000 of
the company's shares.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent's shares dropped to a record low of $1.31 on July 26 as
sales slid and losses mounted during a slowdown in spending on
telecommunications gear. Three days earlier, the biggest U.S. maker
of telephone equipment said its third-quarter loss widened to $7.86
billion and sales fell 50%.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Murray Hill, N.J.-based Lucent Technologies rose 2 cents
to $1.89 on the NYSE. They have fallen 63% this year.</TE>

<HD>Ruling Will Block Some Steel Tariffs</HD>
<DH>Metals: International Trade Commission says cold-rolled
imports have not hurt U.S. producers. The decision adds to the
industry's woes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BLAIR PETHEL</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>United States Steel Corp., Nucor Corp. and other U.S. steelmakers
haven't been hurt by cold-rolled steel imports, a U.S. agency ruled
Tuesday, further eroding protection for an industry that has seen 23
bankruptcies since 1998.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by the International Trade Commission, an independent
agency that weighs the effect of imports on U.S. companies, is a
setback for domestic steelmakers.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling means that duties of as much as 153% proposed by the
Commerce Department will not be applied to cold-rolled steel--used in
such diverse products as highway guardrails and appliances--from
Japan, Australia, India, Sweden and Thailand.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. steelmakers were disappointed by the decision, given that
they had persuaded President Bush, a supporter of free trade, to
protect them from foreign competition this year by applying tariffs
of as much as 30% to many steel imports.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling is "flatly at odds with President Bush's steel program
and the law," said Robert Miller, chairman and chief executive of
Bethlehem Steel Corp.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. steelmakers said the decision would add to their problems,
which were increased after the Bush administration exempted more than
700 steel products from the tariffs the president announced in March.</TE>
<TE>   Since June, almost a quarter of the products originally targeted
by the tariffs have been exempted.</TE>
<TE>   Leo Gerard, president of the steelworkers union, said the ruling,
coupled with the large number of tariff exemptions, would "undermine
the prospects of consolidation and the future for active and retired
American steelworkers."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's tariffs were opposed by U.S. steel-consuming companies and
many U.S. trading partners and prompted challenges at the World Trade
Organization from the European Union, Japan, China and a dozen other
countries.</TE>
<TE>   The exemptions came after a six-month government review that
identified steel products needed by U.S. consuming industries that
U.S. steelmakers weren't able to supply.</TE>
<TE>   Those exemptions may persuade the European Union, which has
threatened to retaliate against the tariffs with $350 million of its
own duties on U.S. products, not to act.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's ruling signals the same outcome is likely in another
part of the case against 15 other countries, including France,
Germany, China and Russia. The final vote on that complaint was
postponed until October at the Commerce Department's request.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. imported about $1 billion of cold-rolled products in 2000
from the 20 countries named in the case, representing about 5% of
domestic consumption.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. steel consumers welcomed the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "Most cold-rolled steel is already covered by the tariffs of up to
30%," said Jon Jenson, president of the Consuming Industries Trade
Action Coalition, an association that represents steel consumers such
as Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Target Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Those tariffs have caused cold-rolled prices to consumers to rise
by as much as 75%, he said.</TE>

<HD>US Airways Cuts Passenger Perks to Reduce Costs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Va.</DL>
<LD>US Airways Group Inc., still flying after filing for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection, eliminated a number of traveler perks Tuesday
to reduce costs, a day after asking a bankruptcy judge for permission
to cancel expensive labor agreements.</LD>
<LD>   Shrunken travel demand and thinning corporate travel budgets have
put airlines around the globe through the wringer since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The leading U.S. carriers are reducing costs to offset flagging
revenue, cutting back on everything from extra utensils to workers'
salaries.</LD>
<TE>   US Airways, the seventh-largest carrier in the nation, said that
it increased its fee for issuing some paper tickets from $10 to $25
when electronic ones are available and that it stopped allowing
holders of nonrefundable tickets to fly standby.</TE>
<TE>   Nonrefundable tickets now lose their value when travelers change
their itineraries once a trip gets underway.</TE>
<TE>   The airline, which reported a $248-million loss in the second
quarter, also began charging economy-class travelers for alcoholic
beverages on transatlantic flights in an attempt to reduce costs.</TE>
<TE>   "These are sort of minor trimmings," said George Hamlin, an
aviation consultant at Global Aviation Associates. "They're not the
basic cuts that address things like labor costs.</TE>
<TE>   "Some consumers will be annoyed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Since filing for bankruptcy protection Aug. 11, US Airways has
sought contract concessions from its 19,000 workers.</TE>
<TE>   Hammering out its many labor issues has been a linchpin, the
company has said, to getting its financial house in order.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways' unionized pilots, flight attendants and other
employees already have agreed to concessions that will save the
airline more than $560 million each year.</TE>
<TE>   But the carrier has not sealed deals with its 12,000 mechanics and
baggage handlers, represented by the International Assn. of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers, or with 6,700 reservation agents
and ticket-counter workers, who are represented by the Communications
Workers of America.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways expects those two employee groups to bear almost a
quarter of the total targeted $1.2 billion in annual savings, and
more than one-third of the $950 million in cost-cutting it expects
from labor groups.</TE>
<TE>   The airline asked a Bankruptcy Court judge to let it reject the
contracts already in place with those workers if the two sides cannot
reach "mutually agreeable cost-reduction agreements" before a date to
be set by the judge.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing on that request is scheduled for Sept. 10.</TE>
<TE>   The Arlington, Va.-based company's shares were unchanged at 69
cents in over-the-counter trading. The stock has fallen 89% this
year.</TE>

<HD>Salomon Documents Name IPO Recipients</HD>
<DH>Probe: Documents show brokerage gave issues to WorldCom
officials in a position to refer investment business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney brokerage and its predecessor
awarded coveted initial public offering shares to several WorldCom
Inc. executives and directors, including founder Bernard J. Ebbers,
according to documents released Tuesday by the House Financial
Services Committee.</LD>
<LD>   The committee, investigating allegations that Salomon set aside
IPO shares for executives in exchange for investment banking business
during technology stocks' heyday, subpoenaed the documents. They show
IPO shares were given to Ebbers, former WorldCom Chief Financial
Officer Scott D. Sullivan and directors Bert Roberts and Stiles
Kellett, among others.</LD>
<LD>   The documents show Salomon rewarded some of the executives who
were in a position to direct investment banking business to the firm.
WorldCom paid Salomon $80 million in banking fees from 1998 to 2001,
according to testimony from the firm's former telecom analyst, Jack
Grubman.</LD>
<TE>   In a letter to the committee, Citigroup said the allocations by
Salomon were legal and were justified because the executives were
among Salomon's biggest individual clients.</TE>
<TE>   "These allocations may or may not have been technically legal, but
setting that question aside it does raise questions in our minds,"
said Peggy Peterson, a spokeswoman for Rep. Michael G. Oxley,
(R-Ohio), chairman of the House committee.</TE>
<TE>   The New York attorney general and other regulators are looking
into whether Grubman issued favorable ratings on certain stocks to
win the firms' banking business. He has denied any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers was awarded 869,000 shares in 21 companies between June
1996 and August 2000. The companies included United Parcel Service
Inc., Rhythms NetConnections Inc. and Juniper Networks Inc. The data
turned over by Citigroup did not include information about when, if
ever, the awarded shares were sold and for how much, a key question
lawmakers probably will ask.</TE>
<TE>   Of the telecom IPOs Ebbers acquired through Salomon, six have
filed for bankruptcy. They are KPNQwest, Williams Communications
Group Inc., Rhythms NetConnections, Metromedia Fiber Network Inc.,
Teligent Inc. and McLeodUSA Inc.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom spokeswoman Julie Moore declined to comment on Ebbers and
Sullivan, noting they no longer work at the company.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom filed for bankruptcy protection in July. Sullivan since
has been charged with securities fraud related to billions of dollars
in accounting misstatements WorldCom revealed in June.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan and his wife, Carla, bought 32,300 shares in nine IPOs
for a total of $680,350 from 1996 to March 2002, the documents show.</TE>
<TE>   Current WorldCom Chairman Bert Roberts received shares in the IPO

<DH>Snobbery is too silly to deserve snubbing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm a snob, yes. And while I'm on the subject, I'll admit to also
being an anti-snob, which is an especially annoying kind of snob. You
see, I'm feeling at ease with the whole subject of snobbery just now.</LD>
<LD>   Ordinarily, this is a touchy matter. Which is to say, we avoid
touching it except on those occasions when we intend to deliver an
insult with the barb exposed. Such as: Did I hear her say she liked
that painting because it matched her carpet? Or, most of the guys in
San Quentin could call themselves self-made men too.</LD>
<LD>   These aren't the kinds of things you want to be overheard saying
about someone, no matter how achingly true, if you expect to be
invited over for foie gras and a swim in the pool again. Such
aspersions are themselves snobbery, of course. As Virginia Woolf
said, "The essence of snobbery is that you wish to impress other
people." Usually at the expense of someone else.</LD>
<TE>   I know these things because I just read Joseph Epstein's witty,
cathartic book, "Snobbery: The American Version."</TE>
<TE>   Epstein is a snob and an anti-snob and, as far as I know, our
reigning theoretician on snobbery. Otherwise, he is a lecturer on
English and a bang-up writer from the snob capital of the heartland,
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   By the trick of taking a gander at our culture through the
peephole of a single idea, Epstein comes tantalizingly close to
achieving a unified force field theory that explains practically
everything that makes us tick, whether it be the smugness of our
political conversations, the contemporary triumph of victimhood, the
annoying proliferation of name-droppers, the reason that our
5-year-old raincoat no longer feels comfortable even though it fits
perfectly or the sudden appearance in some places of more varieties
of virgin olive oils "than actual virgins.''</TE>
<TE>   I may have to read the book again to make sure, but I also think
he suggests a possible rationale as to why people purchase
automobiles capable of exceeding the speed limit three times over, or
why the middleman evokes career envy even though he "creates little,
builds less, changes lots, but develops nothing enduring." I haven't
felt this sunny all summer.</TE>
<TE>   True, as Epstein writes, "every act of snobbery is at bottom an
act of weakness.'' But I say that if life's irritations--our cultural
discordance, even those mysterious impulses we feel--can be decoded
as so much snobbery in action instead of something far darker, then
perhaps the proper response is not despair but a good laugh on
ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   Understanding what separates us provides "a halfway common
language," as novelist Harold Brodkey put it. Which is a start.
Besides, snobbery is one of those universal sins that almost always
shrinks when exposed to daylight. It is, I think, a form of social
profiling that gets us no further than the profiling used by police.
To wit: There may be something behind it, but it ends up saying at
least as much about the profiler as the profiled.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Epstein is particularly harsh on the politics of
"virtuecrats," as he calls them--the self-defining aristocracy of
pontificators who believe their "political views are not merely
correct but deeply, morally righteous in the bargain."</TE>
<TE>   Given my line of work, there was a time when I might have taken
criticism like that personally. Particularly when he libels
virtuecrats as left-leaning prigs. But it came to me that only a snob
of the first order would be glib enough to denigrate morality as a
foundation for politics, let alone relinquish the bulk of it to
leftists. A better belief system would be, what, Darwinian
self-interest?</TE>
<TE>   So I found myself smiling instead. When two snobs cannot make eye
contact for having their noses in the air, you have a setup for
slapstick. At least that's the lesson I tucked away after meditating
on this subject of snobbery. It's pervasive, yes. But not always our
awareness of it. Not in others and not in ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   Epstein deserves a tip of the hat. There is plenty to divide us
these days. It's a relief to realize that some of it, no matter how
earnestly it's expressed, is only the silliest of things.</TE>
<TE>   "Snobbery," observed Proust (a favorite must-read for today's
literary snobs), "is a grave disease, but it is localized and so does
not utterly corrupt the soul."</TE>

<HD>Let Genius Soar Above Tragedy</HD>
<DH>Banish the bland: N.Y. monument calls for greatness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL M. BERGER</AU>
<BD>Michael M. Berger is a Los Angeles lawyer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York belongs to more than just New Yorkers, and so the debate
over what to do with the World Trade Center site isn't just a matter
of what to do with 16 acres of suddenly vacant land in lower
Manhattan. For Americans, New York is the Emerald City of our hopes,
dreams and aspirations--a metaphor for all that is America.</LD>
<LD>   The trade center's towers were sufficiently brash to characterize
the spirit of this exuberant nation and the chutzpah of its great
commercial focus. It's time for New York to snap out of its haze and
start planning a project that recaptures that spirit for all of us.</LD>
<LD>   Part of the charm of New York is the Godzilla-like conviction of
its residents that size does matter, that bigger is better. But that
cockiness has been strangely absent from the planning process. Trying
to steer the course between the Scylla and Charybdis of commerce and
memorials, the planning has been bland and uninspiring.</LD>
<TE>   The planners don't seem to realize it yet, but they will never be
able to please those who want the site to be primarily a memorial,
even if whatever buildings are constructed are scattered around a
meditation park.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly there is a need for introspection and careful thought
after last year's tragic events. But that doesn't justify
architectural designs that befit--as some critics have said--Albany.</TE>
<TE>   Almost as an afterthought, after receiving Bronx cheers from
Manhattan, the chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp.,
which is in charge of World Trade Center planning, said he would now
welcome input from citizens throughout the country. Well, here's one
thought from one of those citizens: It's time to unleash the
nation's, even the world's, architectural and planning genius to come
up with a design that truly soars.</TE>
<TE>   Unconstrained by anyone's knee-jerk preconditions--whether they be
maintaining the sanctity of the actual footprints of the twin towers
or the cash flow to the leaseholder--designers should be put to the
task with the mandate to liberate their imagination and ingenuity in
a roar sufficiently full-throated to match the site, to reflect the
spirit of this nation and to commemorate what was once here.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Lloyd Wright once dreamed of a mile-high building. Perhaps
now its time will never come. But at least out-of-scale ideas like
that should be on the table, along with others that have been lurking
in the dreams and fantasies of architects who have never had the
opportunity to design a monumental development for a site such as
this. A design that tells the Osama bin Ladens of the world that they
can't keep the United States down.</TE>
<TE>   If New Yorkers fail to grasp this opportunity, then they will have
doomed all of us to a continuous vision of ... Albany.</TE>

<HD>Burdening Kids With Innocence</HD>
<DH>Our myths may be putting children in harm's way.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY GRISWOLD</AU>
<BD>Jerry Griswold teaches children's literature at San
Diego State University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Danielle van Dam. Samantha Runnion. Nicole Timmons. Jahi Turner.
Alexis Patterson. Jennifer Short. Elizabeth Smart. The list seems
endless. This year, child-snatching seems a national epidemic taking
on the biblical proportions of Herod's slaughter of the innocents.</LD>
<LD>   As abhorrent as these crimes are, however, child abductions by
nonfamily members remain extremely rare; fewer than 100 cases were
reported in 2001 among a national population of 59 million children.
So what is at work in the American psyche that makes child abduction
our crime du jour?</LD>
<LD>   Pedophilia--"pedo" for child, "philia" for loving--is an
unfortunate term to describe aberrant and criminal behavior, but the
word's generality also suggests our wider cultural context of
child-loving.</LD>
<TE>   Children have been made objects of desire and attached to products
to make those objects desirable: for example, fashion advertisements
that feature junior ingenues in various leering states of undress. At
even younger ages, irresistibly cute children are celebrated in
beauty contests; certainly one of the most haunting pictures of
recent years must be that of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey strutting her
stuff as a cowgirl at one of these kiddie pageants.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Death of Innocence" by John and Patsy Ramsey, JonBenet's
parents assert their innocence in the murder of their daughter and
suggest ways they have been smeared to look guilty. But that title
also provides a sideways allusion and apt description of what
happened to JonBenet, as well as Danielle van Dam and other child
murder victims. In fact, the title's conjunction of death and
innocence is something of an explanation of the phenomena of child
abduction and murder.</TE>
<TE>   The paradigm for this is a moment in Mary Shelley's
"Frankenstein." After his creation, the novel's monster is lonely and
wants companionship. In a remote place, a "beautiful child" happens
his way, and the monster is filled with hope that this innocent will
be uncontaminated by society's values and not reject him for his
ugliness and desires. But the monster is disappointed: The child is
seized, struggles violently, calls out to parents and shrieks all the
while about the hideousness of the monster. In despair, wishing to
silence the child's voice, the monster grabs the youngster's throat
and, in a moment, a body lies at his feet.</TE>
<TE>   For this paradigm of pedophilia, for this yoking of innocence with
death, Shelley might thank Jean Jacques Rousseau. Reacting to
religious tradition, this French thinker rejected the idea that
children entered this world contaminated by original sin and were
essentially beasts until discipline and baptism reshaped them.
Turning tradition on it head, Rousseau suggested that children
entered the world as innocents and were later contaminated by society
and culture.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, either view of the child--as original sinner or
original innocent--is equally exaggerated, but it is Rousseau's view
that holds sway over our times. And it is the cultural notion of the
child's emphatic and malleable innocence, Shelley's novel suggests,
that lures the pedophile, then disappoints when discovered not to be
true.</TE>
<TE>   Harder to grasp and harder to accept, in both our own time and in
Shelley's, is a more matter-of-fact understanding of children as
ordinary, nothing special, just themselves, some good and some bad,
and symbol-free.</TE>
<TE>   This creates a problem. Behind our child-loving, psychotherapist
Adam Phillips suggests in his book "The Beast in the Nursery," is a
pervasive and unrealistic myth that childhood should be trouble-free
and paradisiacal. Most adults, however, realize that their own
childhoods were ordinary or flawed.</TE>
<TE>   This feeling of being shortchanged of our share of paradise,
Phillips argues, prompts adults to live out through their children,
or children in general, a sort of desperate wish that the young have
the innocence we lacked.</TE>
<TE>   This living out through children of a mythical and emphatic
innocence, which adults feel they missed, creates a horrible burden
on children. Not recognized for their ordinariness, children are
saddled with our desires and projections. Not incidentally, this is
what makes them attractive in advertisements and, in some cases,
candidates for abduction. Moreover, as "Frankenstein" suggests, the
pedophile's eventual disappointment may lead to murder.</TE>
<TE>   What the psyche of America now seems obsessed with is innocent
deaths and the death of innocence.</TE>

<HD>The Labor Leader Who Helped Clear a Path for Civil Rights</HD>
<DH>Randolph created the context for King's 'dream.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL MARX</AU>
<BD>Paul Marx is a professor emeritus of English at the
University of New Haven.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If one event, above all others, in the career of Martin Luther King
Jr. helped the cause of racial justice in this country it was the "I
Have a Dream" speech, given on this day in 1963.</LD>
<LD>   Since that day, the speech has come to be a classic of American
oratory.</LD>
<LD>   On the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, King contrasted the hope
black people had 100 years earlier, in the year of Emancipation, with
the despair of blacks in 1963.</LD>
<TE>   In his powerful, ringing cadence, King said: "Now is the time to
rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit
path of racial justice. Now is the time to open the doors of
opportunity to all of God's children. Now is the time to lift our
nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of
brotherhood."</TE>
<TE>   The wonderful rhetoric and the passion were King's; the occasion
and the context were the work of A. Philip Randolph.</TE>
<TE>   Randolph had been the main force in the civil rights struggles of
the 1940s and '50s, and it was he who introduced King on that
historic afternoon. As president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car
Porters for three decades, it was Randolph who had--until Aug. 28,
1963--set the agenda for the civil rights struggle.</TE>
<TE>   In January 1941, as the country was gearing up for World War II,
black Americans could not get jobs in defense plants.</TE>
<TE>   As a labor leader, Randolph was furious. He proposed a protest
march down Pennsylvania Avenue, and thus began what came to be known
as the March on Washington Movement.</TE>
<TE>   Randolph was called to Washington to meet with the president and
members of the Cabinet, all of whom were convinced that a protest
march as the country was getting ready for war would be harmful to
the national interest. But Randolph insisted that it was unacceptable
for black people to be turned away at the gates of defense plants.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin D. Roosevelt said he would speak to heads of corporations
and urge them to provide blacks with equal opportunities to work.
Randolph wanted the president to issue an executive order making
equal opportunity in defense plants mandatory. Otherwise, he said,
100,000 blacks would march. In fact, in the course of the discussion,
Randolph upped the ante. He wanted an executive order that prohibited
job discrimination throughout the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   Roosevelt gave in, and no march was held. A week after the
meeting, the president signed Executive Order 8802, which asserted
that it was U.S. policy "that there shall be no discrimination in the
employment of workers in defense industries because of race, creed,
color or national origin."</TE>
<TE>   When the Japanese surrendered in August 1945, the armed forces
were still segregated. When President Harry S. Truman sent a bill to
Congress for a new military draft, there was nothing in it
prohibiting segregation. Randolph became an organizer of the
Committee Against Jim Crow in Military Service.</TE>
<TE>   A scenario then played out that was similar to the one with
Roosevelt seven years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Randolph let it be known that if segregation in the armed forces
was not stopped, he would urge the nation's youth to ignore the
draft. Randolph and other black leaders were invited to a meeting
with Truman. Randolph testified before the Senate Armed Forces
Committee. Randolph and his followers picketed at the 1948 Democratic
National Convention, carrying signs reading: "Prison is better than
army Jim Crow service."</TE>
<TE>   Unless there was legislation or an executive order that would end
Jim Crow in the services, Randolph was going to urge civil
disobedience against the draft.</TE>
<TE>   On July 26, 1948, Truman issued Executive Order 9981, which called
for an end to segregation in the military as rapidly as possible.</TE>
<TE>   The 1963 March on Washington had its origins in a conversation
between Randolph and his associate, Bayard Rustin. A march on
Washington for jobs and freedom, they thought, would provide dramatic
support for the anti-segregation demonstrations King was
orchestrating in the South. Now it was President John F. Kennedy who
was worried about violence and political backlash. At the end of
July, Randolph was again at the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy was afraid his efforts to cultivate congressional support
for civil rights legislation would be sabotaged by the march. But
Randolph was adamant.</TE>
<TE>   A disciplined and inspirational march took place Aug. 28. King
made his speech, and in the months that followed, the two most
important pieces of civil rights legislation since Reconstruction
were passed: the Voting Rights and Public Accommodations acts.</TE>

<HD>Sweeter Water Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California has never had enough of its own water to control
its own destiny, though conservation has bought it some time. The
region's economic health ultimately depends on Northern California,
on the Colorado River, on the willingness of farmers to sell water to
the cities. This time around, the future may rest with the directors
of the Imperial Irrigation District, who are to decide this week
whether to approve a much-sweetened water deal with San Diego County.</LD>
<LD>   The plan to transfer water from Imperial Valley farmland to
coastal cities is the keystone of an effort to prevent a sudden
federal cutback of water to Southern California from the Colorado
River.</LD>
<LD>   The river water will be lost over 15 years in any case, but if the
Imperial deal fails, the federal government says it will cut the
supply sooner as punishment. The cities would lose 800,000 acre-feet
a year, enough to serve 1.6 million households.</LD>
<TE>   However, Imperial district directors should sign the new San Diego
offer not to help out their urban neighbors but because it's a good
deal for Imperial. San Diego has newly offered to give the district
$130 million in upfront money to offset the economic effect of
fallowing land.</TE>
<TE>   The Imperial fallowing program would be voluntary. Individual
farmers would get a $700-per-acre bonus to start and $550 per acre a
year, beginning in 2008.</TE>
<TE>   The latest version of the deal also protects the Imperial district
against legal liability for degrading the Salton Sea, the salty,
polluted lake at the north end of the Imperial Valley. Imperial's
irrigation runoff provides the sea's only supply of fresh water. If
the runoff is reduced because of the water sent to San Diego, the
quality of Salton Sea water will worsen, posing a threat to fish and
birds.</TE>
<TE>   Through an intricate exchange, San Diego's water would actually
come from the Palo Verde Irrigation District in San Diego County for
the first eight years. This provides a longer period for state and
federal governments to find ways to preserve the sea.</TE>
<TE>   Imperial also must take seriously a U.S. Interior Department
threat that its own Colorado River supply will be cut if the district
is found to be wasting water, as many experts believe is the case.</TE>
<TE>   As important as agriculture is, the public, and even the courts,
may wonder why Imperial should continue to get more than 3 million
acre-feet from the Colorado River while metropolitan Southern
California lives under a threat of having its usage cut by more than
half, to just 550,000 acre-feet.</TE>
<TE>   Like all things about water in the parched Southwest, the Imperial
deal is complicated. But the consequence of its collapse is simple: a
disaster for San Diego that is likely to spill over the rest of the
region.</TE>

<LD>Congress has been shoveling the lion's share of new health research
dollars into programs to strengthen the nation's bulwarks against
biological and chemical terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   In recent weeks, however, the new director of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention has been rightly trying to drum up
support for more funding to fight other ominous public health
threats: the rapid rise of infectious diseases and chronic diseases
in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   The recent arrival of the West Nile virus in the Washington, D.C.,
area is only now waking up legislators to the threat posed by
infectious diseases.</LD>
<TE>   The virus, virtually unknown in the Western Hemisphere until three
years ago, usually causes a mild, fever-like illness. However, it
produces potentially fatal encephalitis in about one out of every 150
cases. The number of Americans afflicted by the virus, which
scientists think may have arrived in the United States in the early
1980s when Asian tiger mosquitoes traveled in tire casings from Japan
to Houston, has jumped from 160 to 371 in the last week and a half.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, some chronic illnesses are indisputably soaring. In the
last decade, for instance, the rate of asthma in U.S. children has
increased 20%; in the last three years, multiple sclerosis in women
has risen 50%. And yet, while chronic diseases are the leading killer
in the United States, the nation lacks a countrywide effort to
research and control them.</TE>
<TE>   Congress needs to create national chronic disease tracking systems
modeled along the lines of the widely respected California Birth
Defects Monitoring System. That research group made headlines
recently with its finding that mothers exposed to automobile exhaust
in the Los Angeles area were disproportionately likely to give birth
to children with congenital heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   CDC Director Julie Gerberding, a former UC San Francisco
epidemiologist, wants to significantly increase the CDC's budget for
monitoring birth defects as well as other chronic and infectious
diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Since assuming office last month, however, she has been facing an
uphill battle. Groups like the conservative organization Concerned
Women for America are lobbying against the budget increase, angry
that Gerberding has identified chronic disease and social and
environmental dangers like guns and air pollution as health hazards
that are as important as bioterrorism.</TE>
<TE>   When Congress returns from summer recess next month, it should
recognize that Gerberding understands something her critics don't:
Protecting Americans against foreign threats, be they biological or
chemical, starts with health tracking at home.</TE>
<TE>   After all--as the Asian tiger mosquitoes' suspected arrival in
tires attests--in today's highly mobile world, viruses and other
deadly pathogens know no borders.</TE>

<LD>California's 1,100-mile coastline is a public treasure, by law and by
custom. The rich have no more right to the sand, at least below the
high-tide mark, than the poor. This shouldn't need restating but it
does, because wealthy landowners are struggling on every front to
keep the beaches to themselves.</LD>
<LD>   Their campaign is not always direct. For instance, not a single
individual or group is on the record as opposing state Sen. Richard
Polanco's SB 1962, a modest measure that largely reiterates the
state's obligation to ensure that beachgoers can get to California's
beaches. Even so, behind-the-scenes lobbying to eviscerate or kill
the bill has almost succeeded in recent months.</LD>
<LD>   The beach bill is scheduled for a full Assembly vote today. If it
is approved, it goes to the governor. But it could fail if lobbyists
for wealthy beachfront property owners and the communities they live
in keep the heat on lawmakers. Their argument is basically that the
property deeds of people lucky enough to own waterfront homes entitle
them to private strips of ocean as well.</LD>
<TE>   In California, the sand seaward of the high-tide line has always
belonged to the public because of the state's Mexican and Spanish
legal heritage. Beachgoers have a limited right to pass across
private property. Over the years, beachfront property owners have
dedicated hundreds of public access paths in exchange for permission
to remodel or expand their homes. For these offers to mean something,
the state has to formally accept them, a time-consuming legal
process, and then find a government or private agency to keep the
stairways or paths clean and repaired--and in some cases, provide
restrooms for swimmers.</TE>
<TE>   The folks who want to sunbathe on their decks or drink their
martinis in perfect solitude have blocked the state at every turn.
Their goal has been to run out the clock on these access offers, most
of which expire after 21 years, by challenging the state's authority
in court at every procedural step toward opening an access path and
sometimes just by padlocking their gates. State lawyers have simply
been outgunned.</TE>
<TE>   Polanco's bill would strengthen the public's hand. It would
obligate the state to accept all access offers before they expire. It
would direct the California Coastal Conservancy, the state body that
administers access, to open at least three access ways each year.
Finally, it would clarify what sorts of nonprofit groups the
conservancy could turn to for management of the paths.</TE>
<TE>   Polanco's legislation preserves a cherished public right. There's
no question that it should pass and Gov. Gray Davis should sign it.</TE>

<HD>Look Past the Stereotypes to See Teen Girls as They Are</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Girl Trouble," Opinion, Aug. 25: Kudos to Karen Stabiner for
voicing the thoughts of many teen girls. I am a female teenager and
so are many of my friends. Contrary to what seems to be the general
opinion, we are quite happy with ourselves. The reason we eat salads
and exercise regularly is not because we are craving the attention of
the opposite sex but rather because we just happen to have the common
sense to keep ourselves healthy.</LD>
<LD>   We have good friends who are boys, but, no--sorry--they are not
our boyfriends. Our lives are fine. No, we are not disgusted with
ourselves; no, we don't wish to be someone else; and no, it's not
inscribed in our heads that popularity is everything. But we do know
who we are, we know where we come from, we know where we are going
and we also know that the path we choose isn't going to have drugs,
violence and early pregnancies in it. If we know this, why doesn't
everybody?</LD>
<LD>   Why is it that every move we make is labeled as a symptom of some
sinister psychological disorder? The "badness" and "goodness" of
people result from the choices they make. But is it just that a few
bad choices stain us all? There is something that we all need to do:
open our eyes and see through the fog, see the beautiful things that
we are missing by letting ourselves be blinded by our stereotypes and
our prejudices.</LD>

<TE>   Studies that document female progress toward equality in
male-dominated American society over the last 10 years provide
encouraging occasions for celebration.</TE>
<TE>   Recent studies that document the dysfunctional behavior of
adolescent girls provide occasions for concern, attention and further
reform.</TE>
<TE>   Stabiner adds nothing constructive to this ongoing revolution by
insisting that critics who investigate are at best moping about in
the past among long- resolved issues of "self-esteem" or, at worst,
trying to demonize these self-made heavenly creatures through the
prism of sexist expectations.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Stabiner surprisingly fails to mention the girl
trouble that is the most obvious impediment to success: pregnancy.</TE>

<TE>   Stabiner's use of Marlborough School for research comparison is
specious at best. I had the honor of being a guest art
teacher/lecturer there within the most recent school year.</TE>
<TE>   Not only are the students the richest of the rich, but the class
size, the facilities and the teachers themselves surpass those of
even some of the more elite colleges in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The students are bright and well behaved but hardly fit to be
objects of a study purporting to be a reliable inquiry into the
motivations for behavior of today's teenage women.</TE>

<HD>Bush Team May Find It Is Alone Against Iraq</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Hussein Is Called 'Mortal Threat,' " Aug. 27: Vice President Dick
Cheney's speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars was nothing short of
scary. To hear him describe Iraq and its leader, you would think it
was Churchill describing Hitler. Well, Iraq is no Germany and I, for
one, cannot understand why very few are outraged by our saber
rattling at Saddam Hussein. It now seems painfully clear that we are
going to war.</LD>
<LD>   And over what? No one has explained why this man is now so
dangerous. Until they show proof that Hussein aided the 9/11
terrorists or is again able to attack his neighbors, then the moral
authority to destroy Iraq is absent.</LD>
<LD>   Let me ask President Bush: Is your political viability so
important that you would cast away the lives of thousands of young
Americans, tens of thousands of innocent Iraqis and destabilize an
entire region? Well, you may soon have your war, but don't be
surprised if many "patriots" like myself resist your ridiculous
actions.</LD>
<TE>   Jerome Haig</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After weeks of trying to create enthusiasm for an unwanted war,
last week the Bush administration suddenly said: "No, we didn't say
that; it was all the media's doing." Then, as quickly, it has
reversed itself again with its so-called "legal experts" and Cheney
now not only demanding war but saying they don't even have to get
Congress' permission.</TE>
<TE>   We true patriots would gladly sacrifice our lives for our nation,
its precious freedoms and its Constitution. But "one nation under
God" is far different from one nation under the thumb of a
power-hungry warmonger--whether he is part of an "axis of evil" or
our own president.</TE>

moral sense enough to be ashamed of our colonialist attitudes.</TE>

<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the face of President Bush's incessant effort to whip us into a
frenzy to make war with Iraq, the emerging chorus, both here and
abroad, of more reasoned voices counseling restraint is most welcome.
Bush needs to remember one of the well-proven maxims of leadership:
Be careful that you do not get too far ahead of those you seek to
lead; you may soon find yourself very much alone.</TE>

as he is about the U.S. political "system" ("Deep Breaths, Monsieur,"
editorial, Aug. 26). In fact, he summed up our problems very nicely,

who'd speak up the same way. Fat chance!</LD>

<LD>Forgive my cynicism, but I find that Luis Cruz's claim of being alive
because of his faith in his God, that his prayers were answered
because his God was watching over him, makes me wonder where this God
was on Sept. 11 ("Faith Kept Stranded Man Alive," Aug. 22). I'm sure
there were many people praying to that same God in those last moments
before they died, and I wonder why they weren't being watched over
and saved. As I say, just wondering.</LD>

<LD>Your Aug. 23 editorial on the constitutional amendments in Pakistan
neglected important aspects of the political process. The amendments
have been undertaken under the authority of the Supreme Court of
Pakistan, the very authority that legally validated the change of
government on Oct. 12, 1999. The essence of the amendments is to
ensure checks and balances in the political structure and to build
the basis for a sustainable democratic order.</LD>
<LD>   Equally, the amendments can in no way be misinterpreted as
draconian measures that have appeared out of the blue. They are the
result of a lengthy process of consultation and a very public debate.
It is important to look at the reforms in their totality and, in
particular, the progressive flavor of the package--increased
representation in Parliament for women, a single electorate that
includes all segments of society, constitutional protection for the
local government system and, vitally, the key instruments of
accountability.</LD>
<LD>   It is unhelpful to view Pakistan's difficult journey to democracy
through a biased lens without taking into account the wider picture
of a turbulent political history and the failed "democratic"
experiences of the past. What is required is a pragmatic solution
tailored to ensure that democracy is sustainable in Pakistan's
political environment.</LD>

<LD>Re "Bad Habits," Voices, Aug. 24: Wit is alive! It served as a
reminder that words are far more than the sum of their meanings or
the basic idea they convey. Words are like the images an artist
paints on the canvas, except that canvas happens to be in the
reader's mind. Anyway, I wanted to thank James Loughrie for dabbling
on my canvas, giving me a smile and the idea that it's all going to
be all right.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In his whiny diatribe, Loughrie used the words "moron," "idiot"
and "stupid" to describe his friends who are trying to help him quit
smoking. His use of those words makes me wonder if he actually has
friends. It seems to me that those words more accurately describe
Loughrie. Maybe hearing something such as this will make him feel
better: If you want to smoke and kill yourself, go ahead. That's your
business. I don't care. Just don't smoke around me, and heed your own
words: "If you see me, be silent and walk away."</TE>

<LD>Re "An 'Irrelevant' Library Leaves City Unserved," Aug. 25:
Attention, Santa Ana! Wake up and serve your population. A measly
$12.51 in library spending per resident and a 10% stock of Spanish
books in a overwhelmingly Spanish-speaking city is pathetic. City
Councilman Jose Solorio's comments ("I would question whether it is
the city's duty to provide materials that mirror the demographics of
the city") make me cringe in disgust.</LD>
<LD>   I worked for a year in Japan and lived in a Tokyo suburb where the
handful of international residents could choose from thousands of
books and magazines in English, Chinese, Korean, French and German.
Naturally, I made efforts to learn Japanese, but looking back, it's
difficult to imagine living without access to English nonfiction,
literature and current events. By no means did I expect such a
treasure of reading opportunities, but the selection was a godsend.
Would Solorio argue that I should have forsaken the printed English
language? Would he?</LD>

<TE>   I am just finishing my master's degree in library science.
Throughout the program we learned that libraries need to reach more
than the typical patron (middle-aged, middle-class white women with
children). The library exists for the entire community, and meeting
community needs should be the main goals of a library. The problem in
the Santa Ana library is reflected in the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Councilman Solorio, it is the library's duty to provide
materials that reflect the demographics. Yes, Councilwoman Alberta
Christy, there are wonderful things on the Internet; however, your
community is poor and largely can't afford computers. Such a
potentially great community resource and expenditure of public funds
should not be limited to a small portion of the city's population. I
thought the city government was supposed to represent and serve all
of its residents. Apparently this isn't true in Santa Ana.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Official Says Investigation Into Afghan Grave Site
Must Wait</HD>
<DH>Asia: War-torn country needs more stability before a probe
can be undertaken without risk to witnesses, according to envoy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>The chief U.N. official in Afghanistan said Tuesday that there is no
chance soon of a thorough, impartial investigation into the alleged
murder last fall of Taliban soldiers, which might implicate troops
loyal to one of the country's most powerful warlords, Gen. Abdul
Rashid Dostum.</LD>
<LD>   Afghanistan must become far more orderly and stable before the
alleged perpetrators can be pursued without endangering the lives of
witnesses who remain in the area, said U.N. special envoy Lakhdar
Brahimi.</LD>
<LD>   "Politics is the art of the possible," he said.</LD>
<TE>   In other areas, however, Brahimi praised the progress of the
Afghan government led by President Hamid Karzai as it seeks to
consolidate peace and establish order in a devastated country that
endured more than two decades of war.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a spate of recent minor explosions here in the edgy
capital, including one outside a United Nations residence Sunday,
government and international authorities believe Kabul is becoming
safe enough to soon lift its midnight-to-4 a.m. curfew, Brahimi said.
And training of new police and army forces, if it continues apace,
should allow the country to stand on its own within two years, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Brahimi's comments came as Afghan officials announced that they
were ready to free hundreds of captured Pakistanis who fought on the
side of the deposed Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   In another gesture of warming relations between Afghanistan and
Pakistan, the countries have promised to cooperate in the pursuit of
Al Qaeda fighters who are believed to be hiding in mountainous areas
along their shared border.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at the end of a two-day visit to Islamabad, the Pakistani
capital, Afghan Foreign Minister Abdullah said he and Interior
Minister Moinuddin Haider of Pakistan agreed to establish mechanisms
for cooperation between their security organizations, particularly to
target terrorists and drug smugglers.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah said the release of the prisoners would begin within
days. Pakistan estimates that more than 900 of its citizens remain in
prison in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   In discussing alleged war crimes, Brahimi--one of the U.N.'s most
experienced trouble-shooters--said difficult compromises often have
to be made and justice sometimes postponed in the interests of
achieving peace and stability.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested that may be true for the investigation into mass
graves recently discovered in northern Afghanistan, which are
believed to contain the remains of slain Taliban prisoners taken into
custody in October when Dostum's forces seized the cities of Kunduz
and Mazar-i-Sharif.</TE>
<TE>   Taliban survivors have alleged that they were forced into steel
shipping containers, without water or ventilation, that were used as
makeshift prisons. They say scores and perhaps hundreds of fighters
died before the containers were opened several days later.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S.-based group Physicians for Human Rights examined a grave
site in May and said it appeared that hundreds of victims had been
dumped there. A recent Newsweek article cited a confidential U.N.
report that quoted a witness as saying 960 people were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Dostum, an ethnic Uzbek general who recently served as deputy
defense minister, remains the chief strongman in that part of
northern Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Brahimi said that trying to conduct a thorough investigation of
such alleged atrocities in those circumstances could threaten the
safety of anyone who took part or came forth with information.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no judicial system that you can really expect to face up
to a situation like this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no police, proper police, to protect the people. So I
think choices have to be made," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he clarified his thinking:</TE>
<TE>   "In a given moment in time, you have got to know how to take
difficult decisions.... It is not a question of condoning or
forgetting about crimes--serious crimes. But it is about moving
[forward] the peace process in the interests of the people of
Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Brahimi expressed optimism about the country's
future.</TE>
<TE>   "The people of Afghanistan remain consistently conscious of the
desperate need for peace for their country," he said. "There is
certainly every reason to be hopeful that the consolidation of that
peace will happen."</TE>

<HD>Arab Resolve Deepens Against Invasion of Iraq</HD>
<DH>Persian Gulf: Qatar and Saudi Arabia refuse to support the
U.S., complicating any Bush administration plan to launch an attack
from bases in the region.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>Qatar's foreign minister ended a two-day visit to Baghdad on Tuesday
during which he added his voice to a growing chorus of Arab
opposition to a U.S. invasion of Iraq, complicating the Bush
administration's ability to launch an attack from the region.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement coincided with a failed attempt by President Bush
to win Saudi support for a military campaign and marked a victory for
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's diplomatic efforts to shield his
regime from attack.</LD>
<LD>   Saudi Arabia already had ruled out the use of its territory as a
base for a U.S. war against Iraq, and the U.S. reportedly has been
moving weapons and equipment to Qatar in recent months. But the
Qatari foreign minister's statements suggested that the tiny Persian
Gulf state would not be happy to serve as a base for a military
campaign against Hussein.</LD>
<TE>   "We are against any military action," Foreign Minister Sheik Hamad
Jassim ibn Jaber al Thani said Monday on arrival in Baghdad, adding
that the United States has not asked for permission to use bases in
Qatar. "This issue should be resolved through the United Nations and
diplomatic means."</TE>
<TE>   The Qataris also called on Hussein's regime to allow international
weapons inspectors back in to confirm that Iraq is not developing
weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   While war remains a matter of speculation, the diplomatic fight
between the U.S. and Iraq is well underway, with exchanges between
them almost a daily routine. A speech Monday by Vice President Dick
Cheney, in which he called Hussein a "mortal threat" who will "fairly
soon" add a nuclear weapon to the Iraqi arsenal, was met Tuesday in
Baghdad by television images of a smiling Hussein in a suit and tie
chatting with the robed Qatari foreign minister.</TE>
<TE>   While the hawks in Washington continue to hammer their
justification for a preemptive strike against Iraq, Hussein is
relentlessly sticking to his own message, one that reverberates in
this region: An attack on Iraq would be an attack on the whole "Arab
nation."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Bush met with Saudi Ambassador Prince Bandar ibn
Sultan at the president's ranch near Crawford, Texas. The Saudi side
reiterated opposition to any military effort to overthrow Hussein,
calling instead for a concerted diplomatic effort.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hussein continued throwing up defenses on almost every
front. On Tuesday, his foreign minister was in China and his vice
president in Syria. Iraq recently negotiated a $40-billion trade deal
with Russia; has granted more than $1 billion in contracts to Turkey
as part of the U.N.-approved "oil for food" program; returned looted
archives to Kuwait; exchanged with Iran the remains of dead from
their 1980-88 war; and in March formally recognized Kuwait's
territorial integrity.</TE>
<TE>   But Hussein also is getting some help. Public support in the Arab
world for Iraq is fueled by widespread anger over the U.S.
relationship with Israel and the equally widespread conviction that
Washington is using its declared war on terror as cover to advance
its own interests. Public sentiment is so universal that even
Kuwait--which a U.S.-led coalition liberated from Iraqi occupation in
1991--is officially opposed to an invasion.</TE>
<TE>   "Kuwait won't help the U.S. just for the sake of helping," said
Abdullah Sahar, a professor of political science at Kuwait
University. "It will help if there is a clear plan that complies with
United Nations resolutions."</TE>
<TE>   "The Kuwaiti people really want to see a change of regime in
Iraq," he added. "We don't want to see an all-out invasion of Iraq by
the U.S.; this would mean all Arab countries are invaded."</TE>
<TE>   Where Baghdad has refused to budge is on the issue of weapons
inspectors, even while all of its Arab allies have called for Hussein
to let them back in.</TE>
<TE>   When a U.S.-led coalition forced Iraq out of Kuwait more than a
decade ago, the U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions that will be
lifted only when inspectors verify that Iraq's biological, chemical
and nuclear weapons have been destroyed, along with long-range
missiles. Inspectors have been barred since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   In comments printed in a government-controlled Iraqi newspaper
Tuesday, Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan seemed to rule out Iraq's
allowing inspectors back in, though the regime has played two ways on
the issue, with some officials signaling that Baghdad is open to the
idea and others ruling it out.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. inspectors "were the reason behind four U.S. aggressions
on our country since 1991. So why should their presence in Iraq now
prevent new U.S. attacks?" Ramadan was quoted as saying.</TE>
<TE>   But Baghdad's reluctance to let inspectors back has not diminished
pan-Arab support for Iraq, if not for Hussein personally. The main
issue for the Arab community is the conflict between Israel and the
Palestinians. Washington has insisted it is not--or, at least, should
not be--linked with regime change in Iraq, but in the Arab world, the
two matters are inextricable.</TE>
<TE>   "We are hurt by the policies adopted, implemented, followed, that
have resulted in total bias toward Israel. We are hurt," Arab League
Secretary-General Amr Moussa said in an interview Tuesday. "We are
hurt. We are angry, and we cannot forget what is going on or what has
happened to the Palestinians. We are in no mood to talk about any
attack against any other Arab country."</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak delivered a similar message
Tuesday to his nation in a televised address.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the American government: If you strike at the Iraqi people
because of one or two individuals and leave the Palestinian issue,
not a single ruler will be able to curb the popular sentiments," he
said. "There might be repercussions, and we fear a state of disorder
and chaos may prevail in the region."</TE>
<TE>   The gap between Washington and Cairo, or any other Arab capital,
begins with a gap in perception. When Americans talk about a state
headed by a terrorist, with weapons of mass destruction, that is in
violation of U.N. resolutions and threatens the stability of the
region, people here--almost universally, and rightly or
wrongly--think of Israel. So when the White House talks of invading
Baghdad, people here see a double standard.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course there is hatred among all people, because of the threat
of the United States attacking Iraq while the Israelis are attacking
the Palestinians and also because the Iraqis are living in peace,"
said Mohammed Saleh Musfir, a political scientist at Qatar
University. "Why should America interfere?"</TE>
<TE>   When the U.S. built the international coalition that drove Iraq
from Kuwait, times were very different. Iraq was clearly viewed as
the aggressor. Saudi Arabia, which borders Iraq, was nervous that its
oil fields might be the next target of Hussein's military. And the
leadership in the region was generally terrified of an Iraq empowered
by Kuwaiti oil.</TE>
<TE>   These days, it is the United States that is widely viewed in the
Middle East as the aggressor. U.S.-Arab ties are strained throughout
the region--from Egypt, which is upset about a U.S. decision to link
some financial aid to a human rights case, to Saudi Arabia, which
feels it has been unfairly criticized since Saudi nationals
participated in the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   These changes have aided and complemented Hussein's own diplomatic
offensive.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation is what we consider to be a clear aggression
against a sovereign state," said Georges Jabbour, a professor of
political science at Aleppo University in Syria.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BILBAO, Spain</DL>
<LD>Local police in Spain's Basque Country fired rubber bullets at
demonstrators and defused a bomb Tuesday after a judge ordered a
Basque political party shut down for its links to the separatist
group ETA.</LD>
<LD>   The regional police force, the Ertzaintza, closed the main offices
of the Batasuna party in the cities of Bilbao, San Sebastian and
Vitoria. The raids marked the first Basque-on-Basque confrontation
since Monday, when Judge Baltasar Garzon ordered the party shut down
for three years.</LD>
<LD>   The judge accused Batasuna of collaborating with ETA, which has
killed 836 people since it began its campaign in 1968 for
independence for the northern region of 2 million.</LD>
<TE>   The order put the region's self-rule administration in an
uncomfortable position, but a government spokesman said the
Ertzaintza would "comply with the law."</TE>
<TE>   In Bilbao, police dragged away protesters and smashed down a
reinforced door after sawing through chains that Batasuna members had
used to lock themselves in the party's office.</TE>
<TE>   Violent clashes were also reported in San Sebastian. However, an
Ertzaintza spokesman said no one was hospitalized or arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, the Ertzaintza defused a package that contained 22 pounds
of explosives placed outside a courthouse in Tolosa near San
Sebastian. Authorities blamed ETA.</TE>

<HD>Court Admits Germ Use by Japanese Troops in WWII</HD>
<DH>Asia: Demands for compensation by 180 Chinese who say they
were victims are rejected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>A court in Japan acknowledged Tuesday for the first time that the
nation used biological weapons before and during World War II, but it
rejected demands for compensation by 180 Chinese who claimed they
were victims of the germ-warfare program.</LD>
<LD>   The Tokyo District Court ruled that, under international law,
foreign citizens cannot seek compensation directly from the Japanese
government. Judge Koji Iwata said compensation issues had already
been settled under postwar treaties between Japan and China.</LD>
<LD>   However, the court acknowledged that Japan's germ-warfare program
existed and that testimony from the Chinese victims was "reasonable"
enough to believe. It was the first time a Japanese court has
recognized Japan's use of biological weapons.</LD>
<TE>   Koken Tsuchiya, the plaintiffs' lead lawyer, said acknowledgment
was a step in the right direction. He said he would appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "Because the district court has accepted, as fact, testimony about
Japan's biological warfare program, it cannot be refuted by the
higher courts," Tsuchiya said. "This is equivalent to an admission of
wrongdoing by the national government."</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs had demanded that Japan pay them $83,430 each and
apologize for the activities of biological warfare units such as the
infamous Unit 731, a Japanese army unit based in northern China.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs claimed that at least 2,100 Chinese died in
outbreaks of cholera, dysentery, anthrax and typhoid that allegedly
were mass-produced by Unit 731, based outside the northeastern
Chinese city of Harbin, in the 1930s and '40s. Germ warfare was
already illegal under international law at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people in my hometown were waiting for good news. Now I
feel sorry for them," said plaintiff Chen Zhifa, who was 9 when his
father and older brother died in a 1941 plague outbreak allegedly
caused by microbes Japanese troops dumped in his village.</TE>
<TE>   The case has been closely followed in Japan because it has
unearthed details about the country's biological warfare program that
the government and U.S. occupation forces kept secret after the war.
Some Japanese veterans had testified that they mass-produced cholera,
dysentery, anthrax and typhoid in Harbin in the early 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   Japan has refused to confirm those accounts. After decades of
denial, Tokyo confirmed the existence of Unit 731 several years ago,
but it has yet to disclose specifics about the unit's activities.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Tuesday, a government official said Japan will send a
delegation to China next month to excavate wartime chemical weapons,
including mustard gas and lewisite, a fluid that emits highly toxic
vapors.</TE>
<TE>   The abandoned arms include bombs, shells and lethal chemicals.
About 700,000 chemical weapons remain, Cabinet spokesman Osamu
Watakai said.</TE>
<TE>   Specialists from the Foreign Ministry, the Cabinet and the Defense
Agency will try to recover 500 of those weapons during their Sept.
5-27 expedition in Heilongjiang province in northeastern China,
Watakai said. Outside experts will take part in those efforts.</TE>

Moscow had "broken all limits" with the alleged attack.</LD>
<LD>   Russia has denied bombing the lawless Pankisi Gorge, where the
Kremlin says rebels from the breakaway republic of Chechnya are
hiding. Russia reiterated that it was prepared to hand over proof,
including radar transmissions, to Georgian authorities.</LD>
<LD>   But Shevardnadze, speaking at a church in Pankisi where
67-year-old Guram Otiashvili's body was laid out, told about 1,000
people that many world leaders had written to express their
indignation.</LD>

<HD>Bush, Saudi Envoy Seek to Mend Rift</HD>
<DH>Meeting: The president fails to win support for military
action against Iraq. Arabs say they hope for diplomatic efforts
instead.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas</DL>
<LD>President Bush met with Saudi Arabia's ambassador Tuesday to mend
frayed relations between their two governments but failed to win
Saudi support for the possible use of military force to oust Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   A day after Vice President Dick Cheney laid out the
administration's case for "regime change" in Baghdad, the Saudis
forcefully stated anew their opposition to achieving that aim through
military action.</LD>
<LD>   Even before Bush welcomed Prince Bandar ibn Sultan and six of the
envoy's eight children to his Texas ranch, a senior Saudi official in
Washington declared that the Bush administration still had not made a
cogent case for a preemptive strike against Hussein. Adel Jabeir,
foreign policy advisor to Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, called for a
concerted diplomatic initiative instead.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't believe that people have thought through all of the
consequences of" military action, Jubeir said on CNN.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Saudis agree that Hussein is a threat, but he added:
"What exactly will it take to deal with it? How many troops? Who's
going to pay for it? Where are they going to land? How many years
will they have to occupy Iraq? How do you stabilize the country? Are
the Kurds going to seek their own state? Is this going to make the
Turks nervous? Is this going to destabilize Iran?"</TE>
<TE>   Many U.S. lawmakers of both parties--and American allies around
the world--are posing similar questions even as the administration
this week escalated its saber-rattling.</TE>
<TE>   Jubeir's comments also stressed that the Saudis, who were key
participants in the 1991 Persian Gulf War against Hussein, are
unwilling to take part in any war now. Saudi officials have been
"very clear on this with your government for a long time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, during his conversation with Bandar, insisted that he had
made no decisions about how to proceed against Hussein, White House
Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   But, Fleischer added, "the president made very clear again that he
believes that Saddam Hussein is a menace to world peace, a menace to
regional peace."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney, in an address Monday to veterans in Nashville, said that
only a preemptive strike against Iraq could prevent it from acquiring
nuclear weapons "fairly soon." He also argued that ousting Hussein
could bring more stability to the Middle East and enhance the chances
of peace between Israel and the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney's comments were widely seen as an administration response
to skepticism some lawmakers and former foreign policy officials have
expressed about the wisdom of military action against Hussein. Also,
some Bush supporters have complained that the administration needed
to make a more forceful case for such a policy.</TE>
<TE>   Differences over Iraq have underscored strained relations between
the United States and Saudi Arabia since the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks. Most of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals, prompting
some U.S. experts to criticize the desert kingdom for not doing more
to stem religious extremism.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi officials bristle at such suggestions. And they were angered
by a lawsuit filed by 700 relatives of Sept. 11 victims that alleges
that the Saudi government was among those that helped finance Osama
bin Laden's terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   In July, a private U.S. analyst told a Pentagon advisory panel
that Saudi Arabia should be considered an enemy.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials said Bush made a point of rejecting that
suggestion during an 18-minute telephone call Monday with Crown
Prince Abdullah in advance of his meeting with Bandar. Bush also
assured the prince, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, that
relations between the two nations remain strong.</TE>
<TE>   In his meeting with Bandar, Bush promised to continue consulting
with Saudi Arabia as well as other allies on Iraq, Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also urged Saudi Arabia to make good on its pledge to give
more than $100 million to help Afghanistan rebuild. Thus far, a
senior administration official said, Riyadh has fallen "far short" of
its commitment.</TE>
<TE>   The president also brought up a custody dispute between the U.S.
and Saudi Arabia involving Amjad Radwan, a woman born in 1983 in
Houston to an American mother and Saudi father. The couple later
moved to Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   When Radwan's mother, Monica Stowers, wanted to return to the
United States, the father refused to let the child go, and a court in
Saudi Arabia awarded him custody.</TE>
<TE>   Bush expressed his hope that the dispute can be resolved so that
Radwan "can be brought back to the United States," Fleischer said,
adding that there are other custody disputes between the two
countries with similar circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said Bandar vowed to relay the message to officials in
Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   Jubeir, in his comments, made clear that Saudi Arabia does not
share Cheney's dim view of the role U.N. weapons inspections might
play in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The vice president had suggested that Washington would not
necessarily be deterred from its intentions even if Iraq were to
readmit the inspectors, absent from the country since 1998, to
monitor compliance with a program Baghdad agreed to at the end of the
Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe [the inspection program] will succeed," Jubeir said,
"and if it does, the objective [of searching for weapons of mass
destruction] will be achieved without firing a single bullet or
losing a single life."</TE>

<DL>YUEYANG, China</DL>
<LD>The major Chinese city of Wuhan escaped flooding Tuesday as the
swollen Yangtze River receded, but authorities downstream braced as
high water raced toward them.</LD>
<LD>   The flood crest of the Yangtze had passed through Wuhan by midday
Tuesday, reducing pressure on flood dikes, according to the Yangtze
River Water Resources Committee. The agency's headquarters are in
Wuhan, a city of 7 million people.</LD>
<LD>   Downstream, the river was near danger levels on dikes protecting
Jiujiang, a city of 600,000 in Jiangxi province, local authorities
said. Officials there urged people not to be "blindly optimistic,"
the official New China News Agency said.</LD>
<TE>   "The city government has issued two urgent notices calling on
every county and city along rivers or lakes to overcome indifference
and a sense of good luck," the agency said.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 1,000 people have been reported killed in flooding or
landslides since China's rainy season began in June.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in India's northeastern state of Bihar, hundreds of
villagers fled their homes as rivers breached their banks.</TE>
<TE>   Water levels in the Gandak and Ganges rivers surged after
authorities in neighboring Nepal released large amounts of water from
the Balmikinagar Dam, which was threatening to overflow.</TE>
<TE>   The torrent flooded villages in Gopalganj district, 95 miles north
of Patna, the state capital, the Central Water Commission's daily
flood bulletin said.</TE>
<TE>   The death toll from monsoon floods and waterborne diseases in
Bihar has risen to 352, said Alok Ranjan, a senior relief official.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Looking More to Cuba After Castro</HD>
<DH>Policy: 'We have a number of interests in play,' one
official says of the planning. Easing the embargo, however, is not
among them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration, convinced that Fidel Castro's regime could
collapse at any time, has begun developing plans to help Cuba manage
a change in government and nudge the aging president's successor
toward a U.S.-style system.</LD>
<LD>   Administration officials say they are trying to chart how they
would react if the Cuban leader's death, for example, opened the way
for a leadership more sympathetic to the United States. And they are
considering what they would do if it set off a mass migration toward
Florida that the United States would have to head off.</LD>
<LD>   From President Bush down, the administration "has come to a
realization that we need to be more vigorous in thinking through what
we would do in any number of contingencies," said a senior
administration official who asked to remain unidentified. "We have a
number of interests in play."</LD>
<TE>   As it has begun this planning, the administration has been
stepping up a diplomatic program intended to persuade Cubans that
their next government should be democratic and market-oriented.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, the U.S. government began contracting with
American academics and other researchers for policy papers that it
hoped would assist Cubans in building a new, more democratic form of
government. Recently, it has been stepping up its support of these
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, for instance, the U.S. signed a $1-million
contract with the University of Miami, which is sponsoring research
into how Cuba could, among other things, restructure its judiciary,
strengthen the rule of law, build democratic institutions and
compensate individuals or families whose property was confiscated by
Castro's government.</TE>
<TE>   The effort to steer Cuba toward democratic change is the second
prong of the Bush administration's policy toward the island.</TE>
<TE>   The first, of course, is the 40-year-old embargo on travel and
trade with Cuba, which the administration has been fighting hard to
maintain in the face of increasing resistance from Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the House voted to ease restrictions on travel to the
island, based on the belief that contact between the countries is the
best way to lead Cuba to democracy. But Bush, who believes that more
trade and travel to Cuba will only enrich the Castro regime, has
vowed to veto any legislation that includes the eased restrictions if
they survive a congressional conference committee scheduled to begin
hearings next month.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's allies in the Cuban American community are
applauding its efforts to steer Cuba toward democracy after Castro.</TE>
<TE>   "This administration actually intends to do something to promote
democracy and regime change in Cuba," said Dennis K. Hays, executive
director of the Cuban American National Foundation, who was the State
Department's coordinator for Cuban affairs from 1993 to 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton administration "discouraged us from thinking about
change," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hays said the U.S. needs to do what it can to influence the shape
of Cuba's next government because it cannot afford either a
continuation of the current system or a descent into civil chaos.</TE>
<TE>   And though Castro remains very much in command in Cuba, where he
took control in 1959, he celebrated his 76th birthday Aug. 13. Raul
Castro, his brother and designated successor, is 71.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to look beyond Castro ... because of the actuarial tables
if nothing else," the senior administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the regime change could occur through any of a number of
scenarios, including a rapid implosion or "a slow decay from inside,"
as happened in the Soviet Union. The United States' poor record in
predicting past government collapses makes it more urgent to prepare
now, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts believe that the government that succeeds Castro
might permit additional limited free enterprise--perhaps focusing on
small businesses--as a way of turning around the economy. But many
also believe that it would resist political reform.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Congress sought to increase pressure for change in Cuba
by passing the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act. The
law--widely known as the Helms-Burton Act after its two main
sponsors, Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Rep. Dan Burton
(R-Ind.)--codified the trade and travel embargo and directed the
Clinton administration to draw up plans to take an active role in
reshaping the Cuban government if Castro fell.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the embargo say that although planning for a regime
change is a good idea, the administration could do more by opening
Cuba to more trade and travel.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said lifting the restrictions would be
the best way to expose Cubans to American voices and values. Now,
Castro's "is the only voice that's heard," he said.</TE>

<LD>Israeli army and naval forces pushed up the Gaza Strip coast early
today in a move that may dampen prospects for a security deal with
the Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses said 11 tanks and armored personnel carriers swept into
the coastal village of Sheik Iljeen, just south of Gaza City.
Illuminated by flares, helicopters and boats fired at unknown targets
in the surf. The village was pitched into darkness by a blackout.</LD>
<LD>   The Israeli army had no immediate comment on the action, which
comes a week after Israel agreed to turn over security
responsibilities for the West Bank city of Bethlehem and the Gaza
Strip to Palestinians. The Palestinians are to rein in militants in
these areas as a test case for a wider truce.</LD>

<HD>Bin Laden Back at Al Qaeda's Helm, Journalist Says</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Osama bin Laden is firmly back in command of Al Qaeda and the group
is digging in for guerrilla attacks on U.S. troops in Afghanistan, an
Arab journalist with close ties to the militant's associates said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Abdel Bari Atwan, editor of the London-based daily Al Quds al
Arabi, said Al Qaeda associates recently told him that the network
has regained confidence after facing intense U.S. bombing and is
ready to fight over the long haul.</LD>
<LD>   "Al Qaeda were shattered during the U.S. bombing, so it was
difficult for Bin Laden to stay in control. Now they said he is fully
in command again and they have regrouped and are organized again,"
Atwan said.</LD>
<TE>   "Al Qaeda people say they are relaxed now and they will fight a
war of attrition against U.S. soldiers," said Atwan, who interviewed
Bin Laden in 1996 and stays in contact with his associates.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden is in good health and "safe" and is planning new attacks
on the United States, he was told, but the Saudi-born exile's
whereabouts were not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   "My sense is that he will time any new attack to coincide with a
U.S. attack on Iraq. He would want to capitalize on this to appeal to
the Arab street, so he will probably delay any attacks until the
United States moves on Iraq," Atwan said.</TE>
<TE>   "He will probably want to be seen as the only Arab standing up to
the United States when the United States attacks Iraq."</TE>

<LD>A plane chartered by the Saudi government for a meeting in Texas

<TE>   Controllers contacted the Transportation Safety Administration,
and two F-16s were scrambled to escort the plane to Grand Junction,
Colo., where security and immigration agents briefly talked with the

<HD>N. Koreans' New Assignment: Fundamentals of Capitalism</HD>
<DH>Asia: Citizens face big changes, including higher prices
and a market orientation. Currency devaluation may be in the works.</DH>

<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>If it sounds like Economics 101, that's because North Korea is
starting at the very beginning, introducing basic concepts such as
supply and demand that have been unknown in the staunchly Communist
country.</LD>
<LD>   Within the last two months, the North has made changes in its
economic system that are perhaps the most radical in the country's
history. It has phased out its obsolete public distribution system,
which was hailed as creating a workers' utopia by doling out basic
goods but in reality had reduced the population to starvation.</LD>
<LD>   In a nod to the market economy, it has increased prices of
everything from rice to subway tickets to reflect actual costs.
Salaries have been raised more than tenfold so that people can afford
the higher prices.</LD>
<TE>   North Korea also may be devaluing its currency, which had been
fixed at such ludicrously high levels that foreign trade was
virtually impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Cho Myong Chol, a former economics professor at North Korea's Kim
Il Sung University who defected to the South, says the current
reforms were under discussion from the time of the Berlin Wall's
collapse in 1989 but couldn't be implemented because of opposition
from the university's namesake, the nation's founder. In the early
years after Kim's death in 1994, his son and successor, Kim Jong Il,
had to consolidate power before he could take dramatic action.</TE>
<TE>   "Now Kim Jong Il is in full control of the [Communist] Party. He
is in a position to go ahead with reform," Cho said. "He has
experimented with his father's ways and realized that they do not
work."</TE>
<TE>   In their characteristically secretive style, the North Koreans
have offered scarce commentary to the outside world on the changes.
And when they have, they've insisted that they are merely fine-tuning
the system. "The adjustment of wages and prices has been made on the
basis of socialist principles--within the boundary of a planned
economy," said a recent report in Chosun Shinbo, a Korean-language
newspaper in Japan that is often used as a mouthpiece for North
Korea.</TE>
<TE>   But economists who follow North Korea say the reforms amount to
far more than tinkering and are tantamount to a belated
acknowledgment that the country's system has failed.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't pretend anymore. They realize the world around them
has changed," said Bradley Babson, a senior advisor to the World Bank
who follows North Korea. "They may or may not have their hands around
the problem, but they are trying on an order of magnitude that we
haven't seen before."</TE>
<TE>   Under the old system, prices in North Korea were so low as to be
meaningless--but that was a moot point because there was nothing to
buy anyway. For example, rice was supposed to be sold to consumers
for a pittance, but there has been virtually no rice available at
public distribution centers for the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, North Koreans had turned increasingly to black
marketeers to avoid starvation, often paying in U.S. dollars or
Japanese yen instead of their own currency.</TE>
<TE>   With the reforms that took effect July 1, prices in the public
distribution system are supposed to come in line with the prices
charged by private marketeers. And at the same time that the North
Korean government is increasing the prices it pays farmers and
manufacturers for their wholesale goods, it is removing subsidies
that for years propped up unprofitable businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "We are reforming the economic system on the principle of
profitability," Kim Yong Nam, the president of the Supreme People's
Assembly, told Kenzo Oshima, the U.N. undersecretary-general for
humanitarian affairs, who was visiting earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   There are reports as well that, in July, North Korea launched a
pilot project in North Hamgyong province to allow farmers private
plots on what used to be collective farms. If the agricultural
project, which has not been officially announced, indeed exists, it
would resemble one of the first reforms implemented by the late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in 1978 in overhauling China's economy.</TE>
<TE>   Also, a delegation of eight North Korean officials is believed to
be in Beijing to study China's banks. A banking system would be
another critical step for North Korea to create a market economy.</TE>
<TE>   Among North Korea watchers, there is a vigorous debate about the
economic reforms. The World Bank's Babson is an enthusiast, saying
the changes resemble a highly successful package of reforms Vietnam
undertook in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a system as out of whack as theirs, you can't do
everything at once, but price reform is one of the earlier things you
can do," Babson said.</TE>
<TE>   The naysayers assert that the biggest danger of the price and wage
increases is that they will trigger runaway inflation without
increasing product availability.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't need a PhD in economics to know that if you have too
much money chasing too few goods, you will only end up with
inflation," said Marcus Noland of the Institute for International
Economics in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Noland believes the package of reforms is far more radical than
anything Kim has tried before, including diplomatic overtures to the
outside world.</TE>
<TE>   The North Koreans, he said, "are undertaking some fundamental
changes that will affect everybody. This is not something that only
affects the elite.... But it is unclear if they have thought through
what they are doing. It is a big roll of the dice."</TE>
<TE>   If the reforms backfire, they could undermine a regime that many
believe should have collapsed long ago.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea experts say they expect the reforms will be
accompanied by a bolstering of the powers of the secret police and
military to nip in the bud any public displays of dissent.</TE>
<TE>   South Koreans who have met the North Korean leader say he is a
longtime admirer of Park Chung Hee, the dictator who engineered South
Korea's so-called economic miracle of the 1960s and 1970s while
vigorously suppressing democratic opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Given the extreme repression and secrecy of the North's regime, it
is anybody's guess what North Koreans really think of the economic
upheaval. The few public comments have been predictably upbeat.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very practical, and it encourages us to work harder," said
Kim Chin Hee, a 28-year-old North Korean woman who was part of an
official delegation visiting Seoul this month for Korean Independence
Day celebrations.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Is Saddam Hussein's Iraq an immediate threat to the safety of the
United States? President Bush says yes; Brent Scowcroft, his father's
former national security advisor, says no.</LD>
<LD>   Should the United States make its goal the ouster of Hussein? Vice
President Dick Cheney says yes; former Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger says maybe not.</LD>
<LD>   And should the United States invade Iraq without first gaining
authority from the United Nations? Aides to Bush and Cheney say yes;
former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who also served under
Bush's father, says no.</LD>
<TE>   All summer long, the debate over U.S. intervention in Iraq has
whirled into full force. If the answers aren't yet clear, at least
the questions increasingly are.</TE>
<TE>   And so far, the debate is almost entirely between two camps of
Bush Republicans, with Democrats on the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   One camp, often known as ''neoconservatives,'' includes the
president, the vice president, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld
and others in office.</TE>
<TE>   The second camp, historically dubbed ''realists,'' includes Baker
and Scowcroft.</TE>
<TE>   But the debate has heated up enough for more pungent terms to
arise. Neoconservative columnist William Kristol, once an aide to the
first Bush's vice president, Dan Quayle, derided Scowcroft and his
ilk as ''appeasers''--a fighting word in foreign policy circles.
Scowcroft refused to respond, at least on the record, but his friend
Lawrence S. Eagleburger--another former secretary of State--has
dismissed the neocons as ''chest-thumpers.''</TE>
<TE>   Most Democratic leaders haven't said much except to urge President
Bush to consult with Congress before he goes to war. "They're sitting
back laughing," said a top GOP figure in the debate. "If we're
fighting with each other, they don't want to get in the way."</TE>
<TE>   But they may be missing out.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a vitally important debate--a debate over the difficult
question of when preemptive military action is justified," said
Michael Mandelbaum, a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations.
"It turns out that it's hard to take the United States to war ... and
it ought to be. But that difficulty may be a sign of the health of
the American system."</TE>
<TE>   Bush and his aides have said that they welcome the debate, and
have emphasized that the president has not yet decided what military
course to take. "It would be a mistake to read what we have been
saying as a sign that some kind of action is imminent," a White House
official said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Here are the principal points of the debate so far:</TE>
<TE>   * Is Iraq an immediate threat to the United States?</TE>
<TE>   All year long, the president has warned that Hussein might give
chemical, biological or nuclear weapons to terrorist groups like Al
Qaeda--but the evidence of links between Hussein and Al Qaeda has
been slim.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech in Nashville on Monday, Cheney emphasized a different
side of the Iraqi threat. If Iraq develops nuclear weapons, he said,
"Hussein could then be expected to seek domination of the entire
Middle East, take control of a great portion of the world's energy
supplies, directly threaten America's friends throughout the region,
and subject the United States or any other nation to nuclear
blackmail."</TE>
<TE>   That appeared to be a response to Scowcroft, who argued in the
Wall Street Journal that the threat has been exaggerated.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam is a familiar dictatorial aggressor, with traditional
goals," he wrote. "There is little evidence to indicate that the
United States itself is an object of his aggression. Rather, Saddam's
problem with the U.S. appears to be that we stand in the way of his
ambitions. He seeks weapons of mass destruction not to arm
terrorists, but to deter us from intervening."</TE>
<TE>   If Hussein acquires nuclear weapons, Scowcroft argued, the U.S.
should act then. But for now, the administration's war on terrorism
should come first--and invading Iraq would disrupt that effort.</TE>
<TE>   * Should the United States insist on overthrowing Hussein, or can
Iraq be contained through new and tougher U.N. weapons inspections?</TE>
<TE>   Bush and his aides have decided that the only way to ensure that
Hussein will not attack his neighbors, or use weapons of mass
destruction, is to topple his government. "It's the stated policy of
this government to have a regime change," Bush said last month.</TE>
<TE>   One of the few Democrats to speak out at length on the issue,
former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, has argued that regime
change is not necessary--and that U.S. aims could be achieved by
sending U.N. arms inspection teams back into Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that Iraq and Saddam Hussein are contained pretty well
within this sanctions box," Albright said last week on PBS' "NewsHour
With Jim Lehrer," referring to the U.N.'s military and economic
sanctions. " ... I think that it would be very good if we could get
the inspectors back in."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Republican "realists" have taken a middle position,
arguing that the United States should try inspections first and
resort to war only if they fail.</TE>
<TE>   Kissinger, secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard
Nixon and Gerald Ford, has argued that U.N. inspections would either
weaken Hussein's regime or give the U.S. a stronger case for military
action.</TE>
<TE>   "If it were possible to devise an inspection system that Saddam
would accept, and if it were possible to implement it and to enforce
it on him, I think that would bring about ... a significant regime
change," he said on PBS. "But I do not believe that that is possible
without the threat of war."</TE>
<TE>   But Cheney dismissed the idea: "On the contrary, there is a great
danger that it would provide false comfort that Saddam was somehow
back in his box."</TE>
<TE>   * If the United States decides to invade Iraq, should it seek
authority from the United Nations?</TE>
<TE>   Bush and his aides have promised to "consult" with Congress and
with U.S. allies before launching military action, but they have made
no promise to bring the issue before the U.N. Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   Unofficially, many neoconservatives dismiss the U.N. as a needless
impediment to U.S. action and reject the idea that an American
president should seek some outside blessing before acting against an
enemy like Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   But the "realists" argue that seeking U.N. authority is a good
idea, in part because it would help persuade other countries to join
in.</TE>
<TE>   Baker, who said he supports the goal of "regime change," argued in
a column in the New York Times: "Seeking new authorization [from the
U.N.] now is necessary, politically and practically, and will help
build international support."</TE>
<TE>   "What [the realists] are arguing is not a case against preemptive
action, but a case against unilateralism," Mandelbaum said. "The
United States fought a lot of major wars in the last century, but
none of them without allies."</TE>

<HD>Zambia Rejects Gene-Altered U.S. Corn</HD>
<DH>Africa: Millions face starvation, but the government cites
safety fears for refusing grain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ and ANTHONY MUKWITA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SHIMABALA, Zambia</DL>
<LD>After waiting seven hours under the sizzling African sun, John
Shikuboni hoped to fill his empty sack with free corn stored in a
warehouse here.</LD>
<LD>   But an aid official told Shikuboni and about 200 other hungry men,
women and children that he could no longer distribute the corn
because the Zambian government had ruled that the genetically
modified grain was not safe for them.</LD>
<LD>   "Please give us the food," pleaded an elderly blind man wearing a
threadbare shirt. "We don't care if it is poisonous because we are
dying anyway."</LD>
<TE>   Many Zambians in rural areas have resorted to eating leaves, twigs
and even poisonous berries and nuts to cope with the worst food
crisis in a decade hitting southern Africa. Still, their government
is refusing to accept donations of genetically modified corn that the
United Nations and aid agencies say could help ease the starvation
and suffering of about 2.5 million Zambians.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, United Nations and humanitarian aid groups
insist that the U.S.-donated corn is safe and identical to grain
eaten daily by people in the United States, Canada and other
countries. But Zambian officials say they fear that the gene-altered
corn poses health risks to their citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "We would rather starve than get something toxic," said Zambian
President Levy Mwanawasa, who declared a food emergency in the nation
three months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, aid officials say the Zambian government is looking a
gift horse in the mouth.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has dispatched to Zambia its top aid
official, Andrew Natsios, administrator for the U.S. Agency for
International Development, to persuade Mwanawasa to accept the food.</TE>
<TE>   Natsios is expected to meet with Mwanawasa today in Lusaka, the
Zambian capital.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to tell him he needs to reverse that decision," Natsios
said in a telephone interview. "It's endangering people's lives, and
we're going to have massive losses of life if this policy remains in
place."</TE>
<TE>   A savage confluence of events--drought, bad governance and
disease--means that about 13 million people in six southern African
countries face starvation. Many of them now rely on rations from the
U.N. food agency to survive.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. officials say they must have $500 million to avert a famine.
So far, the United States has been the most willing donor, shipping a
few hundred thousand tons of food to southern Africa.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. gifts have ignited a debate in the region about the
safety of grain whose genes have been modified to produce higher
yields and bolster resistance to drought, diseases and herbicides.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Africa is not alone in its suspicion of genetically
modified food. The European Union bans many modified products, and
some European scientists say the crops could cause allergic reactions
in consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of several African countries say they find themselves in a
dilemma: Feed their people food they believe causes allergic
reactions, or let them die. Agricultural officials also worry that
the grain would be planted and, through cross-pollination, would
contaminate their natural varieties.</TE>
<TE>   Lesotho, Malawi and Swaziland agreed to accept the U.S. donations
after the World Health Organization--and several U.S.
agencies--certified the U.S. corn as safe. Zimbabwe and Mozambique
accepted the grain on the condition that it would be milled before
distribution to prevent people from planting it.</TE>
<TE>   But Zambia--a landlocked nation slightly larger than Texas--has
been the lone holdout, saying its top scientists had warned about the
alleged health risks of gene-altered corn. The country's agriculture
minister said Zambia would import non-altered food to feed its
hungry.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way we can help them if they don't accept the food,"
James Morris, director of the U.N. World Food Program, said from his
Rome office Tuesday night. "No one is going to step up with donations
of non-GM [genetically modified] corn to fill the gap. This is food
we have complete confidence in."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the official skepticism in Zambia and other countries,
some prominent African scientists have been lobbying for African
nations to embrace genetic engineering to secure the food supply and
increase efficiency and crop yields.</TE>
<TE>   "GM crops and foods are just one part of the overall strategy to
ensure sufficient food" for Africa, said Jennifer Thomson, a
professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of Cape
Town in South Africa. "Europe has enough food. They don't need GM
foods. But we have different needs."</TE>
<TE>   Natsios, the USAID administrator, said he recently was heartened
by the Zambian government's decision to let aid workers distribute
genetically modified corn to Congolese and Angolan refugees living in
camps here.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Zambian government is probably trying to use the
gene-altered corn issue to gain leverage in its relations with the
United States. He noted that the United States greeted Mwanawasa's
election last year with a lukewarm response after the opposition and
other groups alleged that the balloting was rigged.</TE>
<TE>   For the good of starving Zambians, Natsios said, Mwanawasa "needs
to separate the diplomatic issue from this [food] issue."</TE>
<TE>   In Shimabala, a farming village 40 miles south of Lusaka,
Shikuboni and others say they hope the government swiftly reverses
its policy.</TE>
<TE>   Only recently, Shimabala was a bountiful collection of farms
producing maize, cassava and other crops. But the drought has reduced
the corn fields to parched brown earth with only a few dying shrubs.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Grabiner, a food aid official, said the thousands of bags
of food in his warehouse could feed Shimabala's 300 families for at
least a month.</TE>
<TE>   "I would rather eat that maize than die because the government has
no alternative to the hunger problem," said Bweengwa Nzala, a
28-year-old farmhand. "The government was elected by us the people,
and now we are hungry. We want the government to help feed us instead
of forcing us to resort to eating wild fruits like monkeys."</TE>
<TE>   "We are not afraid," said Florence Chisanga, who also waited in
vain at Grabiner's food distribution center. "If we die tomorrow, no
problem. What we want is food."</TE>

<HD>With Hard-Luck Angels Finally Winning, Their Fans See a
Strike as Par for the Curse</HD>
<DH>Sports: After tragedies on and off the field, some say a
stoppage now would be fitting for a jinxed team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pity the long-suffering fans of the Anaheim Angels. Their boys have
never made it to the World Series--though they were a pitch away in
1986. The club has missed the playoffs every year since, and last
season it finished an embarrassing 41 games behind the first-place
Seattle Mariners.</LD>
<LD>   And now, when the running-and-gunning Angels are finally in the
thick of a pennant race, the season may be lost to a strike.</LD>
<LD>   Angel fans know the real score: The team is jinxed.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the curse of the Angels," laments fan Rob Holman of Chino.
"I live and die with these guys ... but mostly die with these guys.
Sometimes it's tough."</TE>
<TE>   So tough that in 1978, then-General Manager Buzzie Bavazi talked a
Roman Catholic priest into blessing Anaheim Stadium. Rumors persist
that the Big A was built atop an old Indian burial ground--proof,
some fans say, that a jinx has hovered over the park since it opened
in 1966--or 19666, as fans like to call it.</TE>
<TE>   Former Angel pitcher Chuck Finley once toyed with hiring a witch
doctor to exorcise evil spirits from the clubhouse, but balked
because of worries that his teammates might freak.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand [bad luck] goes with the game," Finley said in 1999,
"but I'd like someone to explain to me why it goes more with our
game."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the Angels have racked up an impressively long
list of tragedies and mishaps.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie pitcher Dick Wantz, 25, died of a brain tumor in 1965.
Three players died in separate car crashes from 1972 to 1977. In
1978, outfielder Lyman Bostock was killed by a gunshot meant for
someone else. Then, in 1992, the team bus careened off a New Jersey
turnpike, seriously injuring Manager Buck Rodgers.</TE>
<TE>   On the field, the most heartbreaking moment came in Game 5 of the
1986 playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   In the American League Championship Series against the Boston Red
Sox, the Angels were one strike away from the World Series when
relief pitcher Donnie Moore served up a gut-wrenching home run to
Dave Henderson in the ninth inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels lost the game, 7-6, in 11 innings, then lost the next
two games in Boston. The team hasn't been to the postseason since.
When the troubled Moore committed suicide three years later, his
widow said he had never recovered from the stigma of that one hanging
forkball, and she suspected it played a role in his death.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh my God, '86," recalls Chino fan Holman. "To this day, you say
the word '86' and my blood pressure goes up. I can feel my heart,
thump-thump-thump. It makes me crazy. I went into a deep depression
for a couple days after that. It was horrible."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels became a bona fide obsession for Holman, who once took
to going to so many games his wife thought he was having an affair:
"I said, 'Yeah, with these nine guys out on the field called the
Angels.' "Another low point came last season, when the Angels
finished 41 games out of first place--the worst showing in team
history. Columbus Dispatch sports editor Danny Goodwin took this jab:</TE>
<TE>   "The Anaheim Angels? Puh-leeze. The same Angels that in 40 years
of play have never qualified for the World Series? ... The franchise
that was for sale but attracting no takers? The team that was
changing uniforms yet again, perhaps to disguise its players? This
team wasn't a sleeper, it was comatose."</TE>
<TE>   Not anymore. Before Tuesday's games, the Angels were in third
place behind Oakland A's, only half a game behind the Mariners for a
wild-card finish that would qualify the team for the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   As the Angels took the field at home Tuesday night against the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays, labor talks continued in New York, where
negotiators for owners and players debated revenue sharing and the
payroll tax. A Friday strike deadline looms for what could be
baseball's ninth work stoppage since 1972.</TE>
<TE>   What explains the team's suddenly improved performance?</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it's the Angels' new unofficial mascot, the "Rally
Monkey." To jump-start the Angels when a game is on the line, an
image of the hairy primate is flashed on the scoreboard screen,
prompting fans to twirl stuffed rally monkeys in the air.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time he peeks his little head out, something happens for
them," acknowledged Mariners infielder Desi Relaford this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe it's their new look. This year the team shed the blue
pinstriped uniforms with the wings emblem and brought back its
traditional halo with new scarlet duds--calling it a "Red Dawn."</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly--a lifelong Angel fan--said this is the
first year the players have sported the word "Anaheim" across their
chests, making it the smallest city in major league baseball with its
name on a uniform.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm especially proud of that," Daly said.</TE>
<TE>   Daly was there on April 9, 1966, when the Angels christened their
stadium with an exhibition game against the San Francisco Giants. The
Angels were clobbered, of course, 9-3.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of happy memories," Daly said, notwithstanding all the
losses.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, yes, the memories. Russ and Laurie Frazier of Lake Forest were
there for Rod Carew's 3,000th hit, Reggie Jackson's 500th home run
and that devastating 1986 loss in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   They've slept on the ground outside the stadium, for days at a
time, through rain and Santa Ana winds just to buy postseason
tickets.</TE>
<TE>   For 20 years, they trudged to every home game--even when the
Angels were in the cellar, and stayed to the end of the ninth inning
even when it seemed like a lost cause.</TE>
<TE>   They remained loyal even after the team allowed fireball pitcher
Nolan Ryan, probably the most popular player in Angels history, to
slip away to free agency despite throwing four no-hitters for the
team in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "Being an Angels fan builds character," Laurie Frazier said.</TE>
<TE>   And it builds commitment. Strike or no strike, the Fraziers have
already plunked down $1,270 for a pair of playoff tickets.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they can do it," Russ Frazier said.</TE>
<TE>   His wife corrects him. "I know they can," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the year it's going to happen."</TE>

<HD>Mahony Shares His Delight at a Dream Made Manifest</HD>
<DH>Religion: Touring the vast new cathedral, the cardinal
lovingly describes each feature of an edifice that has consumed him
for years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the nave of the nearly finished Cathedral of Our Lady of the
Angels, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony proclaims the man with silvery hair
"a miracle worker."</LD>
<LD>   The man, who appears to be a construction foreman, has just
informed the cardinal that, per his request, the window-washing
scaffolding will be coming down today. The man smiles shyly at the
delight this information elicits, nods and turns away.</LD>
<LD>   "Finally," says the cardinal, standing in front of the burgundy
marble altar he designed himself, flanked by a 10-foot-tall
tapestried procession of saints and blesseds. "Now, I can get some
decent pictures."</LD>
<TE>   For six years, Mahony has photographed the hillside property along
Temple Street, where, from the riven asphalt of a parking lot, this
city's new cathedral has bloomed. Forty albums worth of pictures has
he, but as of yet no final portrait. A few days ago, at sunset, he
took some wonderful photos of the campanile, but a lattice of
window-washing rigs had long marred the cathedral's face. Now the
cardinal will at last be able to take the first "postcard" shots.</TE>
<TE>   Controversy has swirled around the project ever since Mahony
announced in 1995 that instead of repairing the earthquake-damaged
St. Vibiana's Cathedral, he would build a new one. There is
controversy still, but now there is also a cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   And as the cardinal guides a reporter on a tour of the project
that has consumed him, and many others, for the last five years, his
vision of it as a place apart rises all around. Within its tawny
walls, the outside world not so much recedes as is reduced--to an
essence of silence and light and stone in which there is room for the
miraculous and the mundane.</TE>
<TE>   "It is just beyond belief," says Mahony mid-tour. He looks up at
the luminous patchwork of alabaster windowpanes that gives form to
the cross behind the altar, and the river of information and
exclamation that flows so easily from him lies quiet.</TE>
<TE>   "I dreamed of how it would look," he says, still gazing upward.
"But I never thought it could be so beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   On this day, with just 10 left until the dedication, the cathedral
is still crawling with workers. They sit on the steps, talking on
cell phones, sipping coffee from Burger King. One man straddles the
top of one of the enormous front doors, tinkering with something or
other.</TE>
<TE>   The whine and stutter of power tools from inside bounce out into
the early morning, blurred by echo into a sound like whales singing.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the main fountain will be filled with water, and the
baptismal font will be finished. Today, workers have learned that not
all of the angel-etched glass panels will be ready for the back of
the courtyard in time, that plain glass will have to do for the
opening. Today, after an odd, wintry week, the sun, which architect
Jose Rafael Moneo used in the design and building as if it were stone
or mortar, wells over the horizon, stretching fledgling shadows under
the newly planted liquidambar and olive trees.</TE>
<TE>   Crossing the growing brightness of the plaza that aprons the
cathedral, Mahony, in clerical black, is a sudden, striding
silhouette.</TE>
<TE>   "The main themes of the cathedral are light and journey," he says,
describing the symbols on the main entrance--25-ton bronze front
doors designed by sculptor Robert Graham that depict images of the
Blessed Mother and God. "I don't know what the docents are going to
do," Mahony says, interrupting himself. "I mean, you could spend
three hours just on the doors."</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal has had final say on every decision regarding the
cathedral, down to the wattage of the lightbulbs in the freight
elevator. His taste and influence are as much a foundation of this
building as the earthquake-savvy base isolators that hold it up.</TE>
<TE>   He had conversations with Graham about the doors, he says, but the
artist chose the images and symbols. The only thing Mahony insisted
on was an actual statue of Our Lady, which Graham originally had not
been interested in doing.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him the cathedral was named after Our Lady of the Angels,"
Mahony said, "and our city was named after Our Lady of the Angels, so
at some point along the way people would expect to see Our Lady of
the Angels." He quotes himself lightly, good-humoredly.</TE>
<TE>   And there she is just above the door, the Blessed Mother as a
young woman neither delicate nor sorrowing, who extends her bare arms
not so much to comfort as to encourage. "Come with me," those arms
and calm, resolute face seem to say.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal obeys.</TE>
<TE>   He steps over the men who are still working and into a shrill din
of grinding metal and rock.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, it's not so bad today," he says, moving outside the perimeter
of the shriek. Living in the new rectory since March, he has been in
the cathedral almost daily, often in hard hat, the pale dust from the
floor creeping up the cuffs of his pants. Now, he simply steps over
the tools, around the men and through the noise. Raising his voice
just enough, he speaks fondly of the Spanish limestone floors.</TE>
<TE>   "It is so low-maintenance," he says of the sand-colored stone
flecked with red and white. "So forgiving."</TE>
<TE>   Gleaming in the shadows at the end of the long entrance way is a
17th century Spanish Baroque retablo--a gilded altarpiece. A few
steps in, on the right, there is an narrow entrance into the
nave--pews can be glimpsed, and long, spidery light fixtures. One
could enter now, but the point is to keep moving forward, toward the
retablo.</TE>
<TE>   "Moneo uses the past to tempt you along the journey," says Mahony,
"in the hope that you'll want to take the long way around rather than
cutting through."</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal enters the Blessed Sacrament Chapel, a small room
near the entrance to the nave.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of my favorite places," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The chapel, which will have chairs and kneelers, is empty now save
the tabernacle that will hold the Eucharist and the wine used during
the sacrament of Communion. Designed by Max De Moss, the tabernacle
is tall and circular, like the smooth, graceful trunk of a
eucalyptus.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually a tabernacle is a little box," the cardinal says. "But De
Moss had to design a vertical because of the space." He gestures to
the ceiling high, high overhead.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal opens the tabernacle. Two angels appear on the inside
of the doors that reveal the vessel, called a ciborium, for the
Eucharist. The cardinal lifts it out.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea it would be so beautiful," he says. In his hands,
the vessel glows, then suddenly grows pale as the room darkens.
"Oops," says the cardinal, putting the ciborium back, closing the
door. "They're still testing the lights."</TE>
<TE>   There are two other side chapels along the ambulatory. One holds a
statue of Our Lady from St. Vibiana's. The statue is surrounded by a
copse of cameras and lights as if she were a supermodel. A
hand-lettered sign taped to her base reads, "Photo shoot Friday."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony gestures, a full arm extension that takes in the ceiling
and then the floor. "You see how the past and future have been
combined," he says. "That is one of the themes of the cathedral--the
tension between the past and the future."</TE>
<TE>   Then the cardinal surges forward.</TE>
<TE>   Passing the retablo, he enters the nave. Standing there, in front
of the baptismal font, facing the altar, he basks. It is much warmer
than he'd anticipated: The wood of the pews and the earth tones of
the John Nava tapestries soothe the space, with its
alabaster-filtered light and floors the color of adobe.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge space," the cardinal says. "But it doesn't feel like
an aircraft hangar."</TE>
<TE>   Now he moves quickly, from one feature to another. He seems less
the 64-year-old prelate explaining the themes of sacred space and
more a young man enthralled with the nifty details, the gadgetry and
gorgeousness of what he has wrought.</TE>
<TE>   Here are the hinged pews that can accommodate a wheelchair. Here,
you must see these angels: candle sconces that identify which walls
will be anointed in the dedication. The angels, also by De Moss, are
wild as wood spirits; their wings seem to beat against the walls.
Look at the figures in the tapestries--135 of them. See how some are
canonized saints but others are children in tennis shoes, teenagers
with untucked shirts.</TE>
<TE>   "Because ordinary people are also among the blessed," says the
cardinal, as if just noticing another miracle. "They are us, the
ordinary people."</TE>
<TE>   In front of the altar, which is deep red like a heart, a real
heart, he pauses.</TE>
<TE>   "I designed that altar, you know," he says. "Moneo wanted a
circular pattern in the floor, and I said that's a great idea and
we'll have a circular base and just a simple slab on top."</TE>
<TE>   Gold angels, designed by M.L. Snowden, swirl along the base; the
top is unadorned.</TE>
<TE>   "There are too many altars in Los Angeles that are poor quality,"
Mahony says, "that have holes drilled in them for mikes, that have
lost the sense and integrity of the altar. This one--even the altar
cloth won't cover it completely. You will always be able to see it."</TE>
<TE>   The altar was one of the first things brought into the cathedral;
the walls literally rose around it. It was covered, protected, but
one day the cardinal walked in to find it being used in an
un-altarlike way.</TE>
<TE>   "There were four guys eating lunch on it, and one guy with his
blueprints and another hammering, hammering! Right on it. And I said,
'Stop!'" Then, he wrote a note thanking everyone for respecting the
altar and not using it as a lunch table. He copied the note and
plastered it all over the top. With his name about two inches high.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the altar is another Nava tapestry that seems like a simple
series of circles and geometric shapes.</TE>
<TE>   "You must see this," says the cardinal, stepping toward it. It is
the artist's rendition of the heavenly Jerusalem as described in the
biblical book of Revelation. "And then he has overlaid a street map
of Los Angeles," says Mahony, as if he still can't believe it
himself. "Look, you can see our streets," he says, pointing at a
series of lines that runs over the larger forms. "Is that amazing?"</TE>
<TE>   Then he must show the bishop's chair--the cathedra, its wood from
six continents. ("Antarctica doesn't have wood," the cardinal said.
"So it was either ice or penguins.")</TE>
<TE>   On the day of the dedication, the cardinal will stand in front of
the chair to give his homily. He began writing it in January; 32
drafts later, it is done. He will use a TelePrompTer donated by
Rupert Murdoch. "I mentioned we needed one when he was here with his
wife a couple of months ago," the cardinal says. "And two hours
later, I get a call from someone about delivery."</TE>
<TE>   "I have to show you this one angel," he says, walking away from
the bishop's chair. "Because it is just hilarious."</TE>
<TE>   On the wall to the right of the altar is the hilarious angel. He
has one hand to his head, and one extended in a sweeping gesture. His
mouth is wide open and he is looking upward, frowning a tiny bit. He
looks as if he were singing a particularly difficult aria. "Isn't
that great," says the cardinal. "He looks so surprised, or as if he's
calling out in greeting. Every time I look at him, I think of
something different. Usually for these sconces, you just go to a
catalog--there they are, Page 16; give me 12 of them. But we've got
separate works of art. Amazing."</TE>
<TE>   Along the north wall of the cathedral, a long window reveals the
cloister garden, full of oak and sycamore that, once grown, will
shade the walkways and fountain.</TE>
<TE>   Opposite it is the entrance to the reconciliation chapel, and the
three confession rooms in which penitents can either confess through
a traditional screen or face to face with the priest. Bathed in muted
lighting and smell of new wood, they are a far cry from the musty,
dark closets many Catholics associate with the sacrament. The doors
of the rooms are checkered with tiny windows to alleviate the
claustrophobia many feel in the confessional.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a lot of pastors come by and take pictures of the
doors," Mahony says, "wanting to do something similar in their own
church. Oops," he adds, stepping back into one of the rooms. "Gotta
turn off the lights. Always turn the lights off."</TE>
<TE>   He walks downstairs; the basement holds St. Vibiana's Chapel and
the mausoleum. There is also a bride's room; 40 couples already are
set to marry in the cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   In the spacious mausoleum, the stained glass windows soften and
sanctify the rows of crypts. "I moved my parents the other day," the
cardinal says, pointing to the two crypts that hold the bodies of his
mother and father. "I chose the upper row, because it's the cheapest.
The middle row is the best real estate, but it's out of my reach."</TE>
<TE>   To the left of the crypt that is directly beneath the altar,
several rows are reserved for the bishops of the Archdiocese of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   One bears Mahony's name and birth date, complete with life-span
dash on it.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of did a double-take the first time I saw it. But I
thought, 'At least there's no date on this side,' " he says, pointing
to the empty space beside the dash. The income from the mausoleum, he
says, will go into a perpetual-care fund for the cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving the mausoleum, the cardinal points out the choir practice
room. "I already told the choir director that if the mausoleum is
selling well," he says, laughing, "you guys are going to practice out
on the plaza. We could fit about 400 folks in there."</TE>
<TE>   In the freight elevator, he notes that its bulbs have been changed
at his request. "We had, like, 300 watts in here, and it was hot," he
says with the same infectious enthusiasm as when he explained the
design of the front doors.</TE>
<TE>   Although he has seen it in every light, at every stage, in every
mood, Mahony has not yet found his one private space for prayer and
contemplation in the cathedral. "That will take some time," he says.
"There's always been too much equipment."</TE>
<TE>   But he does have a favorite way to enter the place that has filled
his imagination for so long. From the north doors, the floor of the
ambulatory inclines; walking along it, the nave and all its marvels
come into view bit by bit--the alabaster and ceiling, the tapestries
and the angels.</TE>
<TE>   "This way," he says, "the cathedral reveals itself to me slowly, a
little bit at a time."</TE>

<CX>   Cathedral doors--A graphic Wednesday in Section A and the
"Surroundings" story Thursday in the California section gave
inconsistent and incorrect information about the weight of the main
doors at the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. The Great
Bronze Doors comprise the doors themselves, which weigh about 7 tons
apiece, plus the crowning tympanum structure and statue of Mary. The
combined weight of the entire piece is about 25 tons. In addition,
the story Wednesday that the graphic accompanied gave misleading
information about the dimensions of the nave's series of tapestries.
They are 20 feet tall.</CX>

<HD>A Tale of Two Cities' Police Tapes</HD>
<DH>Protest: Parents of man killed by Downey police ask why
Inglewood case got all the attention.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Norma and Norberto Martinez say their son's name should be as well
known as that of Donovan Jackson.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson, a 16-year-old Inglewood boy, was slammed onto a police
car and punched by an Inglewood police officer in July, eliciting
public denunciations by a host of leaders, including that city's
mayor and the U.S. attorney--and triggering a grand jury inquiry that
resulted in criminal charges against two officers.</LD>
<LD>   Gonzalo Martinez's encounter with police also was captured on
videotape. It ended in a hail of gunfire as police fired with
handguns and a machine gun, killing Martinez, 26, and spraying shots
through a residential neighborhood. Martinez, who was unarmed, had
led police on a chase and was shot as he emerged from his car.</LD>
<TE>   Images of that shooting have been briefly aired here--and have
generated outrage in Latin America--but Martinez's parents and
activists say they cannot even get the attention of Downey City Hall,
where the mayor says he has not watched the tape.</TE>
<TE>   In documents, Downey police said Martinez, a suspected drunk
driver who had tried to run over police, was making a "furtive
movement" with one arm as he got out of his car. They decline to
comment otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   The images of Martinez's death, captured in a grisly videotape
that shows the barrage of gunfire and then Martinez's convulsing
body, have sparked only selective outrage. For the last six months,
the dead man's family has led protests outside Downey City Hall.
Images of the shooting were shown in their native Argentina. The FBI
and the Los Angeles County district attorney's office are
investigating.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday night, the Downey City Council reversed itself and
voted to allow the Friends of Gonzalo Committee to march in a protest
Saturday. The council, which had denied a request for a parade
permit, relented after the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern
California threatened to sue. A demonstration in April drew more than
100 marchers.</TE>
<TE>   But the tape has otherwise escaped much notice in Southern
California. In the days immediately after the shooting, some stations
aired portions of the tape, Martinez's family said. The story then
quickly died out, and later this summer was much overshadowed by the
Inglewood incident.</TE>
<TE>   That tape first aired in early July and within days had been
critiqued by Inglewood's mayor, Roosevelt Dorn, as well as U.S. Atty.
Gen. John Ashcroft. Local prosecutors took the case to the county
grand jury, and produced indictments against two officers in less
than three weeks. Those two Inglewood officers have been relieved of
duty while that case moves forward.</TE>
<TE>   In Downey, meanwhile, the officers involved in the Martinez
shooting remain on regular duty.</TE>
<TE>   Downey's mayor, Meredith Perkins, said he has seen the Inglewood
videotape several times on television but has yet to watch the one of
the shooting in his city.</TE>
<TE>   While expressing sympathy for the Martinez family, Perkins said he
wants to be able to make an unbiased decision after he gets reports
from the FBI and district attorney. "Anyone who's involved should get
a fair hearing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Downey officials would not provide the names of the officers who
fired at Martinez. In Inglewood, the Police Department identified the
officers involved within a day of the incident coming to public
light.</TE>
<TE>   The different reactions to the two cases anger local activists.
"How many times have you seen that ... guy get put on that police
car?" said Patricia Pareida, 21, of Paramount, referring to the
Jackson videotape. "This guy died."</TE>
<TE>   The city of Downey, declining comment, has hired the public
relations firm Hill &amp; Knowlton to deal with the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Police have previously offered a partial description of the events
of early Feb. 15. According to police, a patrol officer tried to pull
Martinez over in downtown Downey about 2 a.m., but Martinez fled onto
the Golden State Freeway, then to the San Gabriel River Freeway,
where he lost control and drove into an embankment.</TE>
<TE>   As police approached the car on foot, Martinez backed his car
toward them in an apparent attempt to run them over, according to
official accounts. Police fired at him, then continued to give chase
until Martinez's car crashed in a residential area.</TE>
<TE>   Police ordered Martinez out of the car. As he exited, he raised
his right arm but made what in a coroner's report is referred to as a
"furtive" movement with his left arm. The officers opened fire with a
wide range of weapons.</TE>
<TE>   One used an MP-5, a machine gun that is modified to shoot
three-burst rounds. It has only been fired once before by Downey
police. Another officer fired nonlethal beanbag rounds from a
shotgun, according to the coroner's document.</TE>
<TE>   "This was like a visit from gunslingers in the Old West--they were
just shooting," said Steve Lerman, an attorney representing
Martinez's parents in their lawsuit against the city. "It's not like
this guy was running through an alley firing at the cops. They were
way outside the scope of what would be justifiable."</TE>
<TE>   As police fired, a freelance cameraman was recording the action.
His tape does not show the entire incident but it does picture the
concluding moments.</TE>
<TE>   It first shows two officers pointing handguns at Martinez's
crashed car, while the driver remains inside. More patrol cars roll
up. Then Martinez emerges from the car, facing the officers, his
right hand up. The left side of his body is obscured by the car door.</TE>
<TE>   Almost instantly, at least 14 shots sound and Martinez crumples.
The next day, the Martinez family visited the scene and counted 34
chalk circles investigators had left to mark shell casings.</TE>
<TE>   Norma Martinez, had trouble sleeping that morning and turned on
the television about 5:30 a.m. She was only half-watching the clip of
a police shooting in Downey, and thought little of it until later
that morning, when her eldest son could not be found.</TE>
<TE>   Norma Martinez hurried home and, with her family, began calling
hospitals. In the background, the television was tuned to KVEA-TV
Channel 52, a Spanish-language outlet in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   At that moment, the station played the tape again. This time,
Norma Martinez saw the victim's face. She screamed. "That is the
worst thing that happened to me," she said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   The local English-language television stations did some reports on
the case, but the shooting kept playing and replaying on
Spanish-language television.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, the phone at the Martinezes' home began ringing at
the crack of dawn as television stations in South America saw the
footage and sought interviews. Stories in newspapers in
Argentina--the home country of Norma and Norberto Martinez--compared
the shooting to the infamous Rodney King beating.</TE>
<TE>   Since the shooting, the Martinez family has repeatedly attempted
to convince Downey officials to pay attention to their case.</TE>
<TE>   They printed T-shirts emblazoned with Gonzalo Martinez's photo.
They marched outside of Downey City Hall during council meetings and
addressed the council regularly. Though they mustered about 100
demonstrators in April, other nights they can marshal only about a
dozen. And comparisons with other, more publicized cases such as the
Inglewood beating are often in their minds.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day you hear on the TV about the case in Inglewood and how
the mayor and the chief there took action right away," Michael
Blakey, 17, told a stone-faced Downey City Council at a recent
council meeting. "But our mayor and chief have done nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Perkins, the city's mayor, said in an interview that he and his
colleagues are waiting to see what the outside investigations reveal.
But he said he thinks the two cases are different. "That film they
have on the TV [of the Inglewood beating] is so right there," he
said. The abuse "was right out in the open, you could see it," he
added.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of the difference, Perkins said, is the reaction of the
two cities. "Even though we have a large Spanish group in our city
... there really has not been an outcry from our community."</TE>
<TE>   Martinez's family and supporters ascribe the different reactions
to race. Gonzalo Martinez was Latino while Jackson is black.</TE>
<TE>   Observers say there are other issues as well--beatings, even a
brief one such as the Jackson incident, generally unfold over several
minutes, while the tape of the Martinez shooting is over in seconds.
And many television stations may shy away from repeatedly showing a
graphic shooting like that of Gonzalo Martinez, said Julio Moran,
head of the California Chicano News Media Assn.</TE>
<TE>   But race can be a factor too, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The black community is more organized in terms of reacting to
this kind of incident because they have a longer history" of dealing
with issues of police brutality, Moran said. "The Latino community is
more quiet. Our history is trying to deal with things behind the
scenes."</TE>
<TE>   The Martinez family pledges to keep the pressure on, even as they
await the report from the district attorney's office. It is unclear
how long that will take. Prosecutors are still reviewing a 2001
nonfatal shooting by Downey police.</TE>

<HD>Suspect in Plot to Bomb Fla. Mosques Faces Tests</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A federal judge Tuesday ordered a psychiatric evaluation and
continued detention for a podiatrist accused of plotting to blow up
mosques across Florida.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Goldstein, 37, was silent and appeared disoriented during
his bond hearing before U.S. District Judge Thomas McCoun III.</LD>
<LD>   Goldstein is charged with possessing a non-registered destructive
device and attempting to use an explosive to damage Islamic centers.</LD>
<TE>   The explosives were found in his townhouse in the St. Petersburg
suburb of Seminole. He could face up to 30 years in prison if
convicted.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney, Myles Malman, said the alleged bomb plot had
"elements of fantasy to it," but wouldn't say his client had made the
whole thing up.</TE>
<TE>   Malman said Goldstein has a history of being emotionally disturbed
and was on Valium and other medications. Malman also said his client
was sleep-deprived because his cell was lighted day and night, but
McCoun showed little sympathy.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies searching Goldstein's home Thursday allegedly found more
than 30 explosive devices, including hand grenades and a cache of up
to 40 licensed weapons. They also found a list of about 50 Islamic
worship centers in the state and a detailed plan for bombing an
undisclosed Islamic education center.</TE>

<HD>Federal Deficit Grows Deeper Than Expected</HD>
<DH>Finance: A newly projected four-year shortfall of $452
billion is linked to a sharp drop in tax revenue. Red ink could
affect fall elections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Congressional budget experts warned Tuesday that the government's
fiscal outlook is deteriorating, and they forecast deficits that will
be deeper and last longer than the Bush administration is projecting.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of the three-year, $322-billion shortfall predicted by the
White House last month, the government will post four consecutive
deficits totaling $452 billion, according to the Congressional Budget
Office.</LD>
<LD>   The main factor in recent months has been a sharp drop in federal
tax collections, the biggest in percentage terms since special
wartime levies were lifted in 1946. The falloff has been caused in
large part by the effect of the stock market's declines on payments
of capital-gains taxes. At today's prices, fewer shareholders are
recording profits when they sell.</LD>
<TE>   More red ink could flow if the economy grows more slowly than
expected or if lawmakers approve new tax cuts, extend prescription
drug coverage to Medicare participants or boost other spending.</TE>
<TE>   The revival of deficit spending after four years of surpluses may
increase the anxiety level of Americans already troubled by the
residue of last year's recession and the stock market's big declines
earlier this year. That, in turn, could affect the outcome of this
fall's midterm congressional elections, in which control of both the
Senate and the House is up for grabs.</TE>
<TE>   Recent polls suggest the economy has replaced terrorism as the
issue of greatest concern to Americans. The incumbent president and
his party typically get faulted in times of economic anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   The backlash could be magnified this year if enough voters accept
Democratic arguments that Bush and congressional Republicans
mortgaged the Treasury and jeopardized Social Security by pushing
through a 10-year, $1.35-trillion tax cut last year.</TE>
<TE>   "This has got to be a concern to the White House going into the
midterm election," said Kim Wallace, chief political analyst for
Lehman Brothers, the big investment banking firm. "It has a strong
probability of being the leading factor in decisions made on Nov. 5."</TE>
<TE>   Bush and his fellow Republicans argue the initial stages of the
tax cut eased the recession that was beginning just as the
administration took office. They blame the deficits on the recession,
the economic impact of the Sept. 11 attacks and the cost of the U.S.
response to the terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The CBO's new deficit calculations could increase pressure to
rescind some of the future tax cuts approved by Congress last year,
particularly those targeted at upper-income households. Similarly,
those calculations will make it more difficult to win support for new
spending initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   The revised budget estimates reflect an unusually rapid decline in
the government's fiscal outlook. Early last year, CBO officials
predicted the government would take in $5.6 trillion more than it
spent from 2002 through 2011. On Tuesday, it said Washington would
finish the decade only $336 billion ahead of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the stock market swoon, CBO officials attributed the
shrinkage to the combined effect of the recession, the war on terror
and the Bush tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   CBO Director Dan Crippen noted that even with the downward
revisions, today's deficits appear tame by historical standards. This
year, for example, the agency expects a $157-billion shortfall, which
is equivalent to 1.5% of the nation's total economic output.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, the $208-billion deficit recorded during Ronald Reagan's
administration was equivalent to 6.0% of GDP.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't see deficits going on forever, and they're relatively
small compared with history," Crippen said.</TE>
<TE>   Some budget watchers were less sanguine.</TE>
<TE>   The Concord Coalition, a watchdog group that advocates fiscal
restraint, said the CBO figures should be viewed as a wake-up call to
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "Much of the huge projected surplus turned out to be a mirage,"
said Robert Bixby, the coalition's executive director. "Proposals
that once seemed affordable now add up to perpetual deficits and
rising debt."</TE>
<TE>   Concern about the effect of the shortfalls on the Social Security
system could prove potent as voters size up candidates in this fall's
elections.</TE>
<TE>   Although the CBO's new figures put the government back in the
black by 2005, that calculation includes Social Security surpluses
that some politicians want to put in a "lockbox" for debt reduction.</TE>
<TE>   If Social Security funds were truly off-limits, Washington would
record annual deficits until the year 2011, according to the CBO's
calculations.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the ink had barely dried on the CBO's budget revisions
before Democrats and Republicans began assigning blame.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gone from surpluses to deficits, from paying down our
national debt to increasing it, from saving the Social Security
surplus to spending it," said Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.). He charged that Bush's tax cuts caused 80% of the surplus
shrinkage.</TE>
<TE>   The White House was having none of that.</TE>
<TE>   "The president believes the lesson from today's CBO numbers is
that Congress needs to hold the line on spending," Press Secretary
Ari Fleischer said near Crawford, Texas, where Bush is vacationing.
"If Congress won't do it, the president will do it for Congress."</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad
(D-N.D.), said congressional spending initiatives did not contribute
to the deficits reflected in the CBO projections.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the president's spending," Conrad said. "This is the
president's tax cut. This is the president's fiscal policy that has
driven us right back into the swamp of deficits and debt as far as
the eye can see."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats repeated their demands for a bipartisan "summit" to
address the nation's economic problems.</TE>
<TE>   But while Democrats have been quick to blame the government's
fiscal decline on last year's tax legislation, many have been less
eager to advocate rolling back parts of the tax cut as a remedy.</TE>
<TE>   "When they're asked whether they would vote on rolling back the
tax cut, they run for cover," said House Budget Committee Chairman
Jim Nussle (R-Iowa). "They know that's not popular, and it would have
a devastating impact on the economy."</TE>

carry-on bag, officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The passenger was later arrested with the weapon at Philadelphia
International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   The supervisor hand-searched the bag Sunday but missed the weapon
and a clip of ammunition, said James Loy, head of the Transportation
Security Administration. The employee, who was not identified, was
fired Monday.</LD>
<TE>   "I just simply don't know how the miss occurred, but the
procedures were conducted as we would hope they would be," Loy said
Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>One-Third of Americans Have Insulin Syndrome</HD>
<DH>Health: Those with the condition face a high risk of
diabetes and heart disease, experts say. But diet and exercise
usually can correct the problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>One in three Americans has a condition called insulin resistance
syndrome, putting them at high risk of diabetes and heart disease, a
panel of doctors said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   But diet and exercise can take care of the condition in many if
not most cases, and a few simple tests can tell doctors and patients
who faces the most risk, the experts said.</LD>
<LD>   Insulin resistance syndrome, also known as metabolic syndrome or
syndrome X, refers to people whose bodies do not manage insulin well.</LD>
<TE>   More people are developing the condition as the population eats
more and exercises less.</TE>
<TE>   If not dealt with, it can develop into diabetes as well as heart
disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver or perhaps colon or ovarian cancer.
It affects a growing number of adults and children.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday a committee of experts from four top medical
organizations--the American College of Endocrinology, American Assn.
of Clinical Endocrinologists, American Medical Assn. and the American
College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine--issued
official guidance about how to diagnose the condition.</TE>
<TE>   "As the prevalence of insulin resistance syndrome has skyrocketed
61% in the last decade, it is crucial that medical professionals have
consistent and definitive criteria to assess this serious condition,"
Dr. Daniel Einhorn of the Scripps Whittier Institute for Diabetes in
La Jolla, who co-chaired the panel, told a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Einhorn said pediatricians are complaining that 7-to 10-year-old
children were developing metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes--once
only seen in adults--and obesity. "We never saw this before," Einhorn
said. "Pediatricians are having to learn about adult medications."</TE>
<TE>   No single test can show who has insulin resistance syndrome, the
committee concluded, but measurements of weight, blood pressure,
cholesterol and glucose tolerance can.</TE>
<TE>   One quick check that people can make at home is waist
circumference, the experts said--men with 40-inch waists and women
with 35-inch waists have a higher risk.</TE>
<TE>   Details are available on the Internet at http://www.aace.com.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not any one thing that's the culprit," Einhorn said. "It's
a combination of genetics and the diseases of modern living--obesity
and sedentary living."</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Offer Medicare PPO Program</HD>
<DH>Health: Pilot plan is aimed at offering more care choices.
Critics, however, say it avoids the issue of prescription drug
coverage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Top federal health officials Tuesday announced a new Medicare pilot
program that will give about 11 million senior citizens--nearly a
third of current enrollees--the option of choosing a preferred
provider organization, or PPO, for their medical care next year.</LD>
<LD>   The plan is being offered in 23 states by 33 private insurance
companies. In California, seniors in Los Angeles and Orange counties
will have the option of choosing PacifiCare (New Horizons) as their
provider during the upcoming open enrollment period that starts on
Nov. 15.</LD>
<LD>   In unveiling the plan, Health and Human Services Director Tommy G.
Thompson said he "abhorred the status quo," and that the new plan
offers seniors what they have been asking for: more choices for
health care and prescription drug coverage, although limited.</LD>
<TE>   He pointed out that more Americans under the age of 65 choose PPOs
than any other health insurance option. PPOs offer a loose network of
physicians and allow enrollees to pay an additional fee to see other
physicians. The premiums for PPOs generally are higher than for HMOs
but less than fee-for-service policies.</TE>
<TE>   The program, while embraced by several leading senior citizen
organizations, was criticized by some advocacy groups as an attempt
to sidestep the controversial prescription drug benefit debate with
stopgap privatized coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "There is simply no substitute for providing a prescription drug
benefit for seniors," said Gail Shearer, director of health policy
analysis for Consumers Union. "This plan dances around it. It
provides enriched benefits for some but leaves many with nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Until now, the closest seniors could come to a PPO was the managed
care-based program called Medicare Plus Choice, or they could
purchase so-called Medigap policies such as Medicare SELECT, designed
to bridge gaps in standard coverage by offering beneficiaries lower
premiums or increased benefits if they use the plan's network of
providers.</TE>
<TE>   Those programs, however, have struggled in much of the country
since being introduced in the mid-1990s, leading critics to cite
those problems as a stark example of the limits of privatization.</TE>
<TE>   While initially popular with eligible seniors--particularly those
in low-income and minority communities--Medicare Plus Choice quickly
faltered as enrollees saw promised benefits curtailed and providers
dropped out complaining of scaled-back reimbursements.</TE>
<TE>   "I think seniors were understandably nervous about a plan when you
have a limited number of choices," said Tom Scully, administrator of
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</TE>
<TE>   At a minimum, Scully said, Medicare officials expect 150,000 to
200,000 seniors to choose a Medicare PPO option. "I think it will be
a lot more," he added.</TE>
<TE>   To entice insurers to participate, the federal government offered
to share the financial risks.</TE>
<TE>   Under the financial arrangement, private insurers will be
reimbursed either at 99% of the fee-for-service rate for standard
Medicare coverage or at the local going rate for the Medicare Plus
Choice program, which varies throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   The private insurer must offer all the coverage available through
the traditional fee-for-service Medicare plan but then may elect to
provide additional options to enrollees.</TE>
<TE>   All 33 plans announced Tuesday, for example, offer some form of
prescription drug benefit, although officials noted it is far less
comprehensive than such plans available to most insured Americans
under 65. The insurer then bears both the risk and the potential
benefits of any costs that go either 2% over or 2% under actual
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that margin, insurers have the option of either sharing
additional risks or profits at preestablished percentages or going it
alone.</TE>
<TE>   Scully said that the arrangement allowed PPOs, which were eligible
to participate in Medicare Plus Choice but did not, to feel
comfortable venturing into the senior health-care market.</TE>
<TE>   Although the demonstration project is for three years, the
contracts with providers are yearly, meaning they could drop out
sooner.</TE>
<TE>   Top health officials concede that the history so far with Medicare
Plus Choice may make it tougher for the PPOs to market their plans to
seniors. Thompson and Scully said they announced the new program
Tuesday in part to allow the insurers ample time to make their case
to seniors before the fall open enrollment period. But some critics
argue that seniors are right to be wary.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda McCloskey, director of health policy for Families USA, an
advocacy group pushing for health-care system reforms, said she is
troubled that because the plans are labeled as "Medicare," seniors
will have the false impression that the benefits are guaranteed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think folks have to be pretty confused at this point. They get
used to certain doctors and benefits and then the rug has been pulled
out from under them," she said. "But why would we expect anything
different than what we have seen every year--insurance companies
asking for more money and then cutting back on the benefits they
offer."</TE>

<HD>2 Missing After 9/11 Attacks Are Found in N.Y. Hospitals</HD>
<DH>Survival: New Jersey man is identified by DNA samples and
photos. Homeless Brooklyn man is in a psychiatric facility, family
members say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Two men who were reported missing after the World Trade Center
attacks have been found alive in New York hospitals, according to
officials with the New York City medical examiner's office.</LD>
<LD>   George Sims, 46, was identified by photographs and DNA samples
sent to the hospital earlier this month, after officials alerted his
mother, Newark, N.J., resident Anna Sims, that they believed her son
was in their care.</LD>
<LD>   Albert Vaughan, 45, a homeless man from Brooklyn, was also removed
from the list of those missing after he was discovered in an upstate
New York psychiatric hospital, according to family members.</LD>
<TE>   "We've had many cases of people initially thought to be missing
who were later found and taken off the list, but I can't recall
anything quite like this," said Ellen Borakove, spokeswoman for the
medical examiner's office In these two cases, she noted, "somebody
missing on Sept. 11 has been found ... long after the fact in a
hospital."</TE>
<TE>   Sims' mother, who first told the story of her son's discovery to
the Newark Star Ledger, was reluctant to give many details about his
life. But she said that her son had been "selling things" near the
World Trade Center on Sept. 11. When the family failed to hear from
him after several weeks, they contacted New York police on Oct. 7 to
list him as missing.</TE>
<TE>   "He's alive, but he's not in the best of health," his mother said,
noting that her son has been diagnosed with amnesia and
schizophrenia. "When I saw him, he did not know me. He did not know
his daughter. He did not know his brother."</TE>
<TE>   Sims' brother Jonathan lives in Newark, and his daughter Shalonda
Matthews lives in Greensboro, N.C., according to the Star Ledger.</TE>
<TE>   The family is hoping that Sims will somehow regain his memory,
because they have no idea what happened to him when the twin towers
collapsed and how he managed to survive. "If God brought him this far
back to me, he will come back the rest of the way," his mother said.
"I am just grateful he is alive. God worked a miracle."</TE>
<TE>   In Vaughan's case, family members learned two months ago that he
was being treated at the Rockland Psychiatric Center in Orangeburg,
N.Y. His sister Claudia Benjamin had notified authorities that
Vaughan had disappeared after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Before the attacks, she told police, he was homeless and had spent
much of his time in Lower Manhattan subway stations.</TE>
<TE>   The family offered few details of Vaughan's whereabouts since the
terror attacks, but Benjamin told Associated Press that "I was happy
because I had been thinking that he'd been blown up in the World
Trade Center."</TE>
<TE>   Like Vaughan, Sims had been included in a missing persons' list
along with 693 other New Jersey victims. The number of people thought
to be missing has fluctuated significantly since the attacks, with as
many as 6,700 thought to be dead. The official tally has shrunk to
2,819, as many people feared lost were subsequently located, Borakove
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sims' family never gave up hope that he would be found, and they
did not apply for a death certificate or survivor benefits in the
months after the attacks. Police officials in New Jersey and New York
said they would investigate the case to see whether more can be
learned about how he survived.</TE>

<HD>Co-Workers Call Suspect Disruptive and Lonesome</HD>
<DH>Profile: They say Ward Weaver, in whose Oregon backyard two
girls' remains were unearthed, was a meticulous but surly employee.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OREGON CITY, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Ward Weaver, a shipping and receiving clerk at a small tool company
here, was never one of the guys. He was a meticulous worker but also
cold, brusque and surly, co-workers said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   They said his behavior went from remote to highly unpredictable
after eighth-grader Ashley Pond, 12, vanished Jan. 9 on her way to
the bus stop a few feet from his front door. By the time Ashley's
friend Miranda Gaddis, 13, disappeared from this working-class suburb
March 8--on her way to the same bus stop--Weaver had become erratic,
dashing out of the office on early spring afternoons with no
explanation, or coming in when he pleased.</LD>
<LD>   "He'd leave for three to four hours at a time. It was a running
joke--when would Ward show up at work? 9:30? 11?" said Chuck Aaker, a
salesman at the company, Manufacturers Tool Service.</LD>
<TE>   Now, in late summer, as wildflowers casually wind around fast-food
signs and strip malls fly back-to-school-sale banners, Weaver's
disruptive and lonesome existence makes more sense to co-workers.
Remains of both girls were unearthed over the weekend in his
neglected backyard, and the district attorney's office announced that
it is seeking a grand jury indictment against him, although as of
Tuesday evening he had not been charged in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Contributing to the bizarre impression he made at work, Weaver
went on national television in early summer and declared himself a
suspect in the disappearances. MTS employees said it is
heart-stopping to think that Weaver, 39, worked among them while the
girls lay buried in his backyard.</TE>
<TE>   He was hired in October 2000 at MTS, which sells industrial tools
and supplies, some of which it manufactures in its machine shop. The
plant, in an industrial park a few miles from Weaver's home, goes
through several 54-gallon drums a week of coolant and chemicals for
its machines. Ashley's remains were discovered in a sealed drum, but
authorities declined to say where it had come from.</TE>
<TE>   So many at the factory had such serious suspicions about Weaver
that one said he told a friend on the police force. These middle-aged
men with children of their own said they began watching Weaver and
comparing stories among themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver, meanwhile, either didn't notice or didn't care. They say
that every day he wore the same gray work shirt from his previous job
at the Thrifty Auto Supply store, and passed the hours inside his
small, sunny office or out in the factory, packaging tool purchases
for customers. All the while, he kept the radio tuned to an FM
station that played "bubble gum" music, Aaker said--Britney Spears
songs and the like.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't classic rock or heavy metal," Aaker said.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver avoided conversations with anyone at all costs. He ate his
brown-bag lunch at the small desk, and answered his extension, 2664,
tersely.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a good worker. He was detail-oriented. But you said good
morning and he would just grunt," said MTS salesman Pat Reeves, whose
small, windowed office sits a few hundred feet from the shipping and
receiving bay. "He would never make eye contact with me. This spring,
he was totally stressed."</TE>
<TE>   His reclusive existence was backlit by the baffling story of
Ashley and Miranda, the two eighth-grade girls who went missing eight
weeks apart, both on the way to the bus stop near Weaver's one-acre
property. Their disappearances monopolized water cooler chitchat,
crowding out depressing news about Oregon's shaky economy and the
high unemployment rate.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the first week in August, Weaver quit, giving two weeks'
notice. "He said he was through being hammered by the FBI," Reeves
said.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents came to MTS a few weeks later to confiscate the hard
drives of two computers Weaver had used to track packages. It was
another step in the drawn-out investigation into the girls'
disappearance. But with a search warrant granted to the FBI on Friday
and both sets of remains recovered and identified by Monday, the
families of both girls believe officials have a legally sound case.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not angry at all that it took this long. They understand
that the police got on to the property just as soon as they legally
could," attorney Linda Beloof, who represents both girls' mothers,
said Tuesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   In the factory's cleanly swept parking lot, Sam Moriariu, a
29-year-old machinist, carted a dumpster with a small forklift and
remembered Weaver as a guy who made it clear he wasn't interested in
making friends.</TE>
<TE>   "He just came in and did his job. He had that gray shirt and blue
jeans," Moriariu said, adding that when Weaver brought his daughter
to work, "they'd be all smiles."</TE>
<TE>   Weaver's daughter, 13-year-old Mallori, introduced him to Ashley
and Miranda, both of whom lived in Newell Creek Village Apartments
and often walked up the gently sloping road to his house for slumber
parties. If they weren't coming over to play, they were standing 50
yards from Weaver's front door, waiting for the school bus. Newell
Creek teems with young children, and parents can move in with proof
they can pay an average monthly rent of about $630.</TE>
<TE>   And even though some local girls said Weaver created a safe,
loving atmosphere in his tidy house, court papers and law enforcement
records show there was chronic violence behind closed doors.</TE>
<TE>   Both of Weaver's ex-wives filed restraining orders against him. He
has five children, and in the mid-1980s he served three years in a
California prison for beating his son's baby-sitter with a 12-pound
chunk of cement. Oregon City police records show that authorities
visited his house 10 times in the last 19 months, with most of those
cases classified as domestic disturbance calls.</TE>
<TE>   Since Weaver's Aug. 13 arrest on an unrelated rape charge--the
mother of his infant grandson says Weaver raped and tried to smother
her in Mallori's bedroom--Mallori has been placed in a foster home.</TE>
<TE>   The bus stop has been moved away from Weaver's property. He was
evicted Monday night, and he sits in jail on $1-million bail after
pleading not guilty to the rape charge. But the crimes he is
suspected of committing against Ashley and Miranda continue to
reverberate through the community.</TE>
<TE>   The chain-link fence around Weaver's former house is covered in
teddy bears, angels, flowers, photographs and poems. Candles and
incense burn throughout the night, and at sunset crowds swell as
working parents bring their children to bear witness.</TE>
<TE>   Miranda's remains were found Saturday buried underneath a shed in
the yard.</TE>
<TE>   Ashley's remains were discovered the next day in a sealed metal
drum underneath a cement slab that Weaver installed in March, days
after Miranda disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   He said it was a hot-tub foundation.</TE>

<HD>In the Lab, Suspicion Spreads</HD>
<DH>Since Sept. 11 and the anthrax scare, biologists who ponder
pond slime as well as deadly spores have found themselves under the
microscope.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tomas Foral, a 26-year-old graduate student at the University of
Connecticut, was moving biological specimens from a broken lab
freezer last fall when he came upon some samples collected nearly 35
years ago from an anthrax-infected cow.</LD>
<LD>   Foral moved two samples to a working freezer in the building and
promptly forgot about the matter. Now, he is paying for this
seemingly innocent and mundane act.</LD>
<LD>   In July, Foral became the first person to be charged under the USA
Patriot Act of 2001 with possessing a biological agent with no
"reasonably justified" purpose--a crime that carries a penalty of up
to 10 years in prison. He was investigated by the FBI and now faces
an investigation by his university. His name was added to a
computerized government watch list along with fugitives, drug
smugglers and immigration violators.</LD>
<TE>   "I think this is going a little bit too far," protested Foral, a
soft-spoken researcher who lives in Hartford, Conn. "I saved many
other tissues that day. This is one of the samples that I saved.
That's all that happened."</TE>
<TE>   Foral's tale is giving other scientists chills because of what it
says about the blizzard of change overtaking the once-quiet world of
microbiologists--a motley group dedicated to the study of bacteria,
fungi and viruses. These are the aficionados of everything from
smelly pond slime and cheese-making bacteria to dangerous microbes on
the "select agents" list--a litany of noxious germs including
anthrax, smallpox, Ebola and lesser-known scourges, such as
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever.</TE>
<TE>   Overnight, obscure scientists who had spent years happily
nurturing odd microbes in petri dishes became the center of
attention, hounded by reporters and interviewed by federal
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Anthrax laboratories are bristling with new security cameras,
electronic locks and alarms, and there are rumblings about censoring
biology in the name of national security. Scientists are grappling
with the prospect that one of their own--maybe someone they know--is
a killer.</TE>
<TE>   The fears--and the wave of new laws--have unleashed an unsettling
timidity, as universities and scientists rush to destroy samples of
anthrax and other disease-causing microbes that they once would have
kept, or sent to their colleagues for study. Some scientists have
even requested that key facts be omitted from articles they publish,
lest they inadvertently supply dangerous information.</TE>
<TE>   Zero Tolerance</TE>
<TE>   These are zero-tolerance days, with the government and
universities guaranteed to come down hard on anyone mishandling a
biological sample--even unintentionally.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a clear warning," said Ronald Atlas, bioterrorism expert at
the University of Louisville in Kentucky and president of the
42,000-member American Society for Microbiology. "The scientific
community has been put on notice that we have to watch what we do."</TE>
<TE>   Their world wasn't always this way. Labs were more relaxed in the
days of yore, and it was common enough for freezers to harbor many a
long-forgotten sample. Money for microbiology was tight--in fact,
some microbiology departments closed because their discipline was
viewed as losing relevance.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, I don't think the glamour was there," said Samuel
Kaplan, chairman of the microbiology and molecular genetics
department at the University of Texas Health Science Center at
Houston. Students were drawn more to glitzy genome and stem-cell work
than to a life studying germs.</TE>
<TE>   Today, microbiologists had better know what's in their deep
freeze, and anthrax labs have been turned into little Ft. Knoxes.</TE>
<TE>   Students are flocking afresh to microbiology classes, and money
for studying dangerous germs is flowing like water. At the National
Institutes of Health, funding for bioterrorism has increased from
$52.8 million last fiscal year to a projected $1.7 billion in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The changes have been all the more jarring because of the speed
with which they arrived. Sept. 11 happened, then the anthrax attacks,
and actions that would have barely raised an eyebrow during the
summer became deeply suspicious in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   It was bad luck for Foral that the freezer he was helping to clean
up broke in October, at the height of the anthrax attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Some time during the next few weeks, somebody saw the dead cow
samples sitting in freezer space used by Foral to store samples of
West Nile virus, the subject of his graduate studies. In November,
that person tipped off the FBI, just around the time a 94-year-old
Connecticut woman died after inhaling anthrax spores.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI started an investigation. The university closed the
building containing the samples that Foral had saved, and it tested
the facility for anthrax contamination. Foral retained a lawyer and
continued his research--and then came July, when the Czech-born U.S.
citizen was charged under the Patriot Act.</TE>
<TE>   The act, hurried into law after Sept. 11, made it a crime to
possess "any biological agent, toxin or delivery system" that is not
reasonably justified by "bona fide research or other peaceful
purpose."</TE>
<TE>   There is fuzziness to the story: University authorities say the
department chair had decreed that the samples be destroyed, and some
tubes were indeed sterilized. But there were many students carrying
tubes to and fro that day, and Foral maintains that he never received
that instruction.</TE>
<TE>   "I am convinced that the student had no ill intent and thought he
was doing what we teach all grad students to do--keep specimens,"
said Kirklyn Kerr, dean of the college where Foral studies.</TE>
<TE>   Foral cooperated fully with the FBI and agreed to community work
and some restrictions on his activities to avoid prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   But he remains bitter at how far the investigation went, and he
worries that the affair will cast shadows on his future. Several
weeks ago, he was reentering the country after overseas National
Guard training, and he was detained by authorities because his name
had been placed in the Interagency Border Inspection System, a
computerized database that lists suspicious people.</TE>
<TE>   Foral said he wishes the anonymous tipster--he still doesn't know
who it is--had acted differently.</TE>
<TE>   "The reasonable course of action would have been to inform me, and
the department head, and resolve this issue internally. But no, this
person runs to the FBI," he said. "Whoever did it needs to think
about it for five or 10 minutes--'What am I trying to do? What is the
purpose of it?' "</TE>
<TE>   Biologists understand that times, and laws, have changed and that
they must by necessity amend the way they do business. But they say
that some of the responses by university administrators and
authorities--who are not, after all, microbiologists--have been
driven by an inflated fear of the bacterium itself. The reaction,
some scientists say, has been far out of proportion to the actual
risk of storing and working with anthrax, which until recently was an
obscure microbe studied mostly in veterinary schools.</TE>
<TE>   "People hear the word 'anthrax' and almost go into a panic," said
Ronald Welsh, veterinary microbiologist at Oklahoma State University
in Stillwater.</TE>
<TE>   At Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., research scientist
Daniel Perlman ran into trouble with university authorities after
conducting experiments specifically intended to help in the fight
against bioterrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the anthrax attacks, he'd been asked by a company to
devise a diagnostic tool to detect anthrax contamination.</TE>
<TE>   He and a microbiologist colleague revived an old sample of anthrax
from a decades-old strain collection and within weeks created a
nutrient on which pretty much only anthrax would thrive.</TE>
<TE>   Upon hearing of the scientists' study, Brandeis' administration
became alarmed that anthrax had been grown without university
approval. It called in authorities, and it shut the biology building
for a week to test for spores.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Perlman nor colleague Inga Mahler--both of whom were
interviewed by the FBI--would comment on their experiences, but
others familiar with the case said the university placed Perlman on
leave for nearly a month and set into motion a formal inquiry into
possible scientific misconduct. Both were cleared in May, but Perlman
must now get permission from his department chair for every
experiment he conducts.</TE>
<TE>   The university is pursuing a patent for his invention.</TE>
<TE>   Few scientists have had encounters with the FBI as intimate as
those of Foral and Perlman, but even the cheese makers and pond scum
enthusiasts have had a modicum of contact. In January, the FBI sent a
letter to the microbiology society's entire U.S. membership,
requesting help in catching the anthrax killer.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a horrible feeling to think that it could be someone I
know, that the perpetrator is a microbiologist among us," said
Theresa Koehler, anthrax geneticist at the University of Texas Health
Science Center at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   It is horrible to be a suspect as well--or merely a "person of
interest." Steven J. Hatfill, the most frequently named scientist in
connection with the anthrax mailings, has never been identified as a
suspect. Yet he has been the focus of numerous news articles, often
including quotes from unnamed investigators, and he has been placed
on administrative leave with pay from his job at Louisiana State
University. In a news conference this month, he accused the media and
FBI of making "a wasteland" of his life.</TE>
<TE>   A Fundamental Change</TE>
<TE>   Most microbiologists have adapted to the changes, in part because
most have little contact with the exotic and dangerous world of
deadly pathogens. But even researchers in the most benign corners of
microbiology can sense that something fundamental has changed beneath
their feet.</TE>
<TE>   Microbiology has assumed a kind of split personality. One side is
dedicated to manipulating tiny critters for human good. The other is
a potentially dark enterprise that has now put the world on high
alert.</TE>
<TE>   At the American Society for Microbiology's annual meeting in May,
10,000 microbiologists invaded Salt Lake City, thronging the
convention center and local cafes. Much of their chatter was oceans
away from the world of bioterrorism: microbes that grow in sauerkraut
fermentation vats, bacteria that chomp up pollutants, genes of ulcer
bacteria and the antimicrobial actions of garlic. Session after
session dealt with one of the field's hottest topics:
antibiotic-resistant bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   But clearly, bioterrorism was center stage. Extra-eager scientists
consumed sweet rolls and coffee at a sunrise special on the nuts and
bolts of identifying biowarfare agents. The conference was peppered
with sessions on the anthrax attacks, agricultural bioterrorism and
biological privacy.</TE>
<TE>   At one packed symposium, the audience was giggling one moment at a
silly, germ-themed cartoon ("Be a virus, see the world") and aghast
the next as a speaker described a bioterrorism cookbook that has been
legally sold at gun shows.</TE>
<TE>   One speaker ruffled feathers by questioning the ability of the
government to respond efficiently to a bioterrorist threat,
illustrating her point with a numbingly complex flowchart of all the
government agencies involved. An angry microbiologist stood up and
attacked the speaker for challenging the dedication and patriotism of
government scientists.</TE>
<TE>   The evident tension has also touched one of the fundamental tenets
of scientific research--the open exchange of information through the
hundreds of scientific journals.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to understand the concern. Some scientific papers would
seem to fit perfectly into Bioterrorism 101 primers: fine details of
the anthrax genome, how to render a virus more resistant to the
mammalian immune system, and the existence of antibiotic-resistant
anthrax strains.</TE>
<TE>   One study in July showed how scientists could build the polio
virus from scratch in a test tube--unsettling some critics who
thought it gave terrorists another recipe for mayhem.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it is very difficult to figure out reasonable limits to
experiments or access to biological information, said John D.
Steinbruner, director of the Center for International and Security
Studies at the University of Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to invent schemes that would do more harm than good,"
he said. In much of modern biology, the potential for good and evil
are closely intertwined.</TE>
<TE>   What could be more benign than an experiment to create a new mouse
contraceptive for pest control? Ingeniously, a team of scientists
engineered a mousepox virus (closely related to the smallpox virus)
to trigger an immune attack against mouse reproductive cells. The
engineered virus, however, shocked them with its virulence: It was
able to kill even immunized mice.</TE>
<TE>   The implications for a would-be bioterrorist were obvious--and the
study caused a furor among scientists when it was published.</TE>
<TE>   Today, discussions set in motion even before Sept. 11 are being
pursued with fresh vigor, as scientists, ethicists, and policy and
bioterrorism experts convene in a variety of panels to hash out what,
if any, restrictions should be placed on the free flow of biological
information.</TE>
<TE>   Holding Firm</TE>
<TE>   For now, the American Society for Microbiology is holding firm on
the principle of publishing enough details of an experiment to allow
other scientists to try to repeat the work. It reiterated its policy
after several scientists submitting papers to the society's journals
asked that fine details of their experiments be left unpublished for
fear that they could be misused.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to grow into a major debate in the scientific
community," predicted Atlas of the microbiology society. "If
restrictions are reasonable and responsible, they're just fine. If
they get too draconian, they'll chill science."</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the chilling process has already begun. It is driven
in part by the scientists themselves, who have found that it may be
wiser in these less innocent times to destroy samples and restrict
themselves rather than risk a bureaucratic or legal nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the anthrax attacks, universities in Iowa and
Texas destroyed collections of hundreds of anthrax strains that had
been amassed over decades.</TE>
<TE>   "That is worse than a book-burning," said Glenn Songer, veterinary
microbiologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. "With a
book-burning, some copies of a book will survive, but these organisms
are gone."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists who would once store or mail isolates of anthrax or
other select-agent bacteria to their colleagues when they showed up
in specimens being diagnosed are immediately destroying the samples
instead.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen this time and time again--field samples that normally
we would see have been destroyed because people got nervous," said
Martin Hugh-Jones, anthrax researcher at Louisiana State University
and holder of an extensive collection of strains of Bacillus
anthracis. "It slows up research immensely."</TE>
<TE>   Even less dangerous bacteria are getting dumped instead of shared,
scientists say, because the paperwork involved in mailing bacteria
and viruses has become too tedious.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's some composting needed to work out what is really
needed, what is realistic and what is just a fuss," Hugh-Jones said.
"We're going through a maturation episode, and hopefully when we come
out on the other side we'll be better off."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the wise scientist plays it safe.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after September, Okalahoma State's Ronald Welsh was
repeatedly hauled in front of university administrators for having
the harmless Sterne strain of anthrax in his lab. Sterne is used as
an animal vaccine and can be bought over the counter.</TE>
<TE>   "Joe Bloggs can have it to vaccinate his cattle, but this guy is
being reprimanded for having it," said Songer.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing of Welsh's travails, Songer took no chances when a
sample of Sterne arrived at his own lab. He knew if he kept it there
before the university understood what it was, it could end up
confiscated and steamed into oblivion in the autoclave--and he could
end up with some explaining to do.</TE>
<TE>   So, while he waited for official clearance from the university, he
popped it into a double-walled container, took it home and stored it
in the family freezer.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew it was legal there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There it sat for weeks on end--near the frozen beef, peas and
carrots and the chocolate fudge ice cream.</TE>

<LD>The Burbank Planning Board has rejected a citizens group's attempts
to prevent an expansion project at Burbank Airport, city officials
said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The board late Monday voted 4 to 1 against appeals by expansion
opponents, who believe the airport is using a federal mandate on
security improvements as an excuse for excessive growth.</LD>
<LD>   The board based its decision on grounds that the project complies
with Burbank municipal codes, said Michael Forbes, associate planner
for the city.</LD>
<TE>   Airport officials say their planned 40,000-square-foot expansion
of the 173,000-square-foot main terminal building--which was stopped
by Burbank officials Friday because the airport lacked building
permits--is necessary to meet a Dec. 31 federal deadline to upgrade
airport security.</TE>
<TE>   Airport officials concede that some of their proposed enhancements
exceed federal requirements to improve baggage and passenger
screening, but they insist the entire project involves passenger
security and safety.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-growth activists, however, aren't buying that argument.</TE>
<TE>   The project offers some security enhancements, but "the rest of it
is just an expanded terminal to make it more convenient and
comfortable for the public," said Howard Rothenbach, chairman of the
anti-expansion group, Restore Our Airport Rights.</TE>
<TE>   Rothenbach, whose appeal of an earlier Burbank city staff decision
approving the expansion project was denied Monday night by the
Planning Board, said he would next appeal to the Burbank City
Council, which will likely take up the matter next month.</TE>
<TE>   If the council denies further appeals, city staff would be
expected to decide whether the proposed airport improvements
"directly relate to, or are spun off from the new security
requirements imposed on the airport" before issuing building permits,
said Sue Georgino, the city's director of community planning.</TE>
<TE>   Victor Gill, an airport spokesman, said it will be difficult to
complete the mandated security improvements in the next few months.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fairly certain now we cannot meet the federal year-end
deadline," Gill said.</TE>
<TE>   "We aspired to comply with the requirements of federal law. That
goal is ... now out of reach. We will simply try to achieve the best
results possible under the current circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   Although federal law requires compliance by the end of the year,
the House of Representatives has approved a bill to extend the
deadline a year.</TE>
<TE>   Similar legislation is pending in the Senate. Earlier this month,
133 airports asked the Senate for an extension. Burbank was not among
them.</TE>

<HD>Per Anger, 88; Swedish Diplomat Helped Save Jews From Nazi
Camps</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Per Anger, a former Swedish diplomat who worked with Raoul Wallenberg
in shielding thousands of Hungarian Jews from Nazi death camps, has
died. He was 88.</LD>
<LD>   Anger, who was awarded honorary Israeli citizenship in 2000, died
Sunday night in a Stockholm hospital after a stroke, according to the
Swedish Foreign Ministry.</LD>
<LD>   Anger, who was working as first secretary of the Swedish legation
in Budapest when the Germans occupied Hungary in 1944, began issuing
temporary "Schuetzpaesse," or protective passports, that identified
Jews as Swedes to keep them from being sent to Nazi death camps.
About 600,000 of Hungary's 1 million Jews ultimately died during the
war.</LD>
<TE>   Anger was soon joined by Wallenberg, who extended the practice and
is credited with saving some 20,000 Jews from deportation before he
was arrested in 1945 by Soviet troops and disappeared at age 32.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Anger was one of the leading figures trying to
learn what happened to Wallenberg, traveling to Moscow in the 1980s
to appeal personally to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to reveal the
diplomat's fate.</TE>
<TE>   Anger also was active in spreading information about Wallenberg's
deeds around the world, believing that Wallenberg remained alive as
late as 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "His work was very much appreciated, and he played a vital role in
spreading the message about the importance of Raoul's efforts to save
people during the war," said Wallenberg's half sister, Nina
Lagergren.</TE>
<TE>   Russia acknowledged for the first time about two years ago that
Wallenberg and his driver were imprisoned for political reasons until
they died in 1947. The two men were officially rehabilitated as
"victims of Soviet repression," but details were not provided.</TE>
<TE>   Anger received several awards for his heroic actions to save Jews
during the war.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, he was awarded by Israel and the Holocaust memorial Yad
Vashem as a gentile who, with danger for his own life, rescued Jews,
and a tree was planted in his honor on the Avenue of the Righteous in
Jerusalem. In 1995, he was awarded the Hungarian Republic's Order of
Merit.</TE>
<TE>   Anger was born in Goteborg, Sweden, in 1913. After graduating from
Uppsala University in 1939, he was assigned to the Swedish Foreign
Office in Stockholm.</TE>
<TE>   His first foreign assignment was in 1940, when he joined the staff
of the Swedish Embassy in Berlin. He was transferred to Budapest two
years later.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Anger was assigned to the Swedish embassies in
Cairo; Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Paris; and the consulate general in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   He also served as ambassador to Canada before retiring from the
Swedish diplomatic service in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Anger is survived by his wife, Elena; and three children.</TE>

<HD>Case of Starved Anaheim Baby Is Bound for D.A.'s Office</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Anaheim police on Tuesday concluded their investigation into the
starvation of a year-old girl and plan to turn over the case to the
district attorney's office, which will determine whether to file
murder charges.</LD>
<LD>   Samantha Rose Gutierrez died in March at her parents' Anaheim
home.</LD>
<LD>   The postmortem exam concluded that Samantha died of ketoacidosis,
an imbalance of acids in the blood caused by starvation and neglect.
The coroner found bruises on the child's scalp, fluid on the brain
caused by swelling, and repeated fractures of the girl's right elbow.</LD>
<TE>   Police Sgt. Mike Hidalgo would not reveal details of the
investigation or identify any suspects. No arrests have been made.</TE>
<TE>   "It will go to the D.A.'s office this week. Then it will go under
review. Once they have decided who to charge, [detectives] will draw
up the warrant and make the arrest," Hidalgo said.</TE>
<TE>   The autopsy confirmed the suspicions of officials at Eli Home, a
private, nonprofit child welfare agency in Anaheim that had contacted
police and county social workers about the possible abuse of
Samantha.</TE>

<HD>Orange County Aims to Add to Park System</HD>
<DH>Land: Supervisors set aside $4.2 million to buy 526-acre
Barham Ranch, the rugged habitat of two dozen rare and endangered
bird species.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County moved Tuesday to add a vast swath of oak-filled hills
east of Anaheim Hills to its regional park system, ending a decade of
wrangling over the prime open space.</LD>
<LD>   The effort to buy the 526-acre Barham Ranch represents one of the
last chances to preserve significant acreage for open space as Orange
County's vacant land is built out in the next 20 years.</LD>
<LD>   Acquiring Barham Ranch would connect 477-acre Irvine Regional Park
with the smaller Santiago Oaks and Weir Canyon regional
parks--providing 1,550 acres overall of unspoiled land.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a big accomplishment," said Orange activist Shirley
Grindle, who fought for the property's preservation with a group of
environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday set aside $4.2 million to buy
the property, which is owned by the Orange Unified School District.
Last week, the district declared the land surplus and will offer it
for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer said he is confident the school board and
the county can agree on a fair price.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the land is marked by roller-coaster terrain and is
covered by plants sheltering two dozen rare and endangered bird
species. The area is used by runners and mountain bikers and is
accessible by horseback.</TE>
<TE>   The ranch's purchase, added to 11,000 acres donated this year by
the Irvine Co., means "the whole east Orange area has the potential
to be perpetual open space," Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   The property has long been coveted for a county park, but attempts
to buy it over the years fizzled.</TE>
<TE>   It was originally owned by the Carpenter Irrigation District. In
the 1970s, the now-defunct district sold half of the ranch to Orange
Unified for $80,000, with an agreement that the property would be
used for education purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said the county intends to honor that intent by building
an environmental-education center to teach schoolchildren about the
effects of urban runoff in county watersheds. The county will submit
a letter of interest to the district, a required step before sale
talks can begin.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, developer SunCal Cos. offered $10.4 million to
build 600 high-end homes there. Local residents, environmentalists
and Spitzer united in opposition and the developer eventually dropped
the idea.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2000, the Serrano Water District, which had assumed
control of the other half of the ranch, sold its portion to the
school district for $2.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Grindle credited the current school board with acknowledging that
the rugged land wasn't suitable for schools. State law allows
districts to own property only if they intend to build schools on it.
But the cost to build a road into Barham Ranch and bring utilities to
the area made development unfeasible.</TE>
<TE>   In the course of the fight to preserve the land, Grindle
discovered a threat to the entire park system: A third of the land
didn't have deed restrictions to keep it as permanent open space.
Last year, supervisors added the deed restrictions and barred the
sale of any acreage without a public hearing.</TE>

<HD>Car Hits and Kills Black Bear Near Piru</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Animals are moving into populated areas for food
and water in drought, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 300-pound black bear--the 12th officially sighted in a populated
portion of Ventura County this year--was killed early Tuesday when it
wandered onto California 126 near Piru and was hit by a car.</LD>
<LD>   The Ventura County Department of Animal Regulation usually
receives three or four bear sighting calls a year, but seven months
of drought conditions have forced more bears and other wildlife into
populated areas in search of food and water, said Director Kathy
Jenks.</LD>
<LD>   "The longer the drought lasts, the more we'll see," she said. "As
the drought continues, bears will be coming farther and farther out.
They're coming down early for something to eat."</LD>
<TE>   The bear may have been foraging in avocado and citrus orchards in
the rural area when it walked onto the highway near Camulos Ranch,
said Lt. Chris Long of the state Department of Fish and Game.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always a heavy concentration of bears near avocado
orchards," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bear sightings have occurred this year throughout Southern
California, as they do every year.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to be expanding this year," Long said. "It could be an
increase in population. It could be related to the drought. And burns
might affect it."</TE>
<TE>   A major brush fire in June, for example, scorched more than 22,000
acres above Ojai and imperiled endangered plants and animals in the
Sespe Wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 10, another large black bear was spotted by Saticoy
residents in the middle of the night near an elementary school.
Animal control officers chased the bear until they were able to shoot
it with a tranquilizer gun. The animal was later returned to the
wild.</TE>
<TE>   Four days earlier, a mother bear and her cub died in a house fire
that started while they were foraging for food in a home near the San
Bernardino National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   Black bears rarely attack humans.</TE>
<TE>   As for Tuesday's accident, the Ford Escort involved in the 5 a.m.
crash had to be towed away, but the driver was not injured, said a
spokeswoman for the California Highway Patrol. No other injuries were
reported.</TE>
<TE>   Long said it is not uncommon for vehicles to collide with bears on
deserted highways but added that the species, a popular big-game
animal for hunters, is not in danger of extinction.</TE>

<HD>Judge Delays Hearing in Blake Case to Nov. 13</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a victory for the defense Tuesday, a Los Angeles County judge
delayed until November a preliminary hearing for Robert Blake and his
co-defendant, who are charged in the May 4, 2001, shooting death of
the actor's wife.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Lloyd M. Nash ordered both sides to be ready to proceed with
the preliminary hearing Nov. 13 in Van Nuys.</LD>
<LD>   "I just want to make sure they are adequately prepared," the judge
said, as he denied the prosecution's request that the case move
forward within 10 days.</LD>
<TE>   Nash said he wanted to give defense attorneys Harland W. Braun and
Arna H. Zlotnik enough time to review the 42,000 pages of evidence
that the prosecution has collected.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the volume of evidence in capital murder cases, Nash
said, a delay of as long as 18 months is not unusual. At the
preliminary hearing, a judge determines whether adequate evidence
exists to support the criminal allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory A. Dohi estimated that he and Deputy
Dist. Atty. Patrick R. Dixon would need a week to present their case.
Braun said outside court that he expects to take a few days to offer
a defense.</TE>
<TE>   The 68-year-old actor is charged with murder in the fatal shooting
of Bonny Lee Bakley, 44, and two counts of soliciting murder with the
special circumstance of lying in wait. He and Earle S. Caldwell, his
handyman and bodyguard, are charged with conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   Blake has been held without bail at the Men's Central Jail in
downtown Los Angeles since his arrest April 18. Caldwell, 46, was
freed after Blake posted his $1-million bail.</TE>
<TE>   Nash lifted a ban on cameras and on Tuesday permitted the news
media to capture their first images of Blake--whose hair is now short
and gray--since he was arraigned in late April.</TE>
<TE>   The judge made it clear that he did not intend to extend the same
privileges to the media for the preliminary hearing, where witnesses
will testify.</TE>
<TE>   On another matter, Nash denied the prosecution's motion to
restrict the activities of William C. Jordan, an investigator for
Blake and a potential prosecution witness. Prosecutors said Jordan
had expressed his opinion that Blake was not guilty to a prosecution
witness during an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the state Supreme Court has asked prosecutors to
respond by Friday to Blake's request for a bail hearing. Nash had
denied such requests, saying he would consider the matter after the
preliminary hearing, and Blake appealed.</TE>

<HD>Safety of Busway Assailed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A citizens group opposed to a planned San Fernando Valley east-west
busway alleges that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is
pushing the project forward despite evidence of potential dangers.</LD>
<LD>   In its ongoing lawsuit against the MTA, Citizens Organized for
Smart Transit stated in its brief filed late Monday: "The impacts of
this 'bus highway' are many, but foremost among them is safety. A
facility of this type, at street grade and without barriers or
crossing gates ... would on its face have the potential for serious
safety risks."</LD>
<LD>   The group also contends that the MTA has used flawed data in its
environmental impact and safety analyses of the 14-mile busway, which
would use a defunct rail corridor on Chandler and Victory boulevards
to provide transit between Warner Center in Woodland Hills and the
North Hollywood Red Line subway station. Its lawsuit seeks to void
the busway's environmental impact report, calling it "a paper
exercise designed to feign compliance" with California's
Environmental Quality Act.</LD>
<TE>   MTA lawyers declined Tuesday to discuss the group's latest
allegations, saying they are preparing a written response that they
would file next month. An Oct. 4 hearing is scheduled before Los
Angeles County Superior Court Judge David Yaffe.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the busway is proceeding as planned, with
construction slated to begin in spring 2003 and be completed by
spring 2005, said MTA spokesman Ed Scannell.</TE>
<TE>   While the busway's advocates say the project would provide a
needed boost to the Valley's mass transit system, opponents say its
$329.5-million price tag would be better used to expand the Valley's
rapid bus lines, which run on regular streets at a fraction of the
cost.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Rubin, a transportation consultant and member of the opposing
group's executive committee, said he believes the busway could be
much more dangerous than the MTA's Blue Line because of its numerous
street-level crossings.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Line, which runs from downtown Los Angeles to Long Beach,
had the highest light-rail accident rate in the state during the
1990s, according to the California Public Utilities Commission. But,
unlike the Blue Line, the proposed busway will not have any warning
bells or safety gates for crossing drivers or pedestrians, Rubin
said.</TE>
<TE>   The busway will cross at least 40 streets, including numerous
intersections that are crooked and difficult to control, court papers
said.</TE>
<TE>   Others say the dangers of the planned busway are exaggerated.</TE>
<TE>   "People have been crossing Chandler Boulevard for decades," said
Bart Reed, executive director of the Transit Coalition, a
Sylmar-based rider advocacy group. "Now, all of a sudden because
they're putting in a busway ... it becomes impossible to cross the
street?"</TE>

<HD>Murder Suspect Accused of Assault</HD>
<DH>Trial: Ex-girlfriend of man charged with strangling and
dismembering wife says he forced her to have sex.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors in the trial of a man accused of strangling and
dismembering his wife wrapped up their case Tuesday with testimony
from one of his former girlfriends, who said she had taken out a
restraining order against him after he forced her to have sex.</LD>
<LD>   Alfonso Castillo, 38, is charged with first-degree murder in the
death of Maria Pinaloza Ambario, whose remains were found off the
Ventura County coast in December. Prosecutors believe the Panorama
City resident killed his 34-year-old wife after she threatened to
leave him.</LD>
<LD>   Through an interpreter, Castillo's former girlfriend told Ventura
County Superior Court Judge Herbert Curtis III that one night,
Castillo forced her into his truck, took her back to his apartment
and sexually assaulted her. She said he later dropped her off near
her residence. When she arrived home, her sister-in-law called
police.</LD>
<TE>   Though she was distraught at the time, the woman said she didn't
want to report the crime because she was embarrassed, hurt and
frightened. Instead, she got a restraining order against Castillo.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Doug Daily pointed out that she declined to press
charges against his client, suggesting that a rape did not occur. He
maintained that the woman, who testified under the pseudonym Jane
Doe, wasn't forced into Castillo's truck and could have left when
they stopped at a liquor store on the way to his apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Later Tuesday afternoon, prosecutors played portions of
surveillance tapes from Castillo's apartment complex that showed a
shadowy figure moving around in his apartment during the night of
Dec. 5 and into the morning of Dec. 6. The tape also shows a male
making several trips to Castillo's truck, at one point carrying a
large light-colored trash bag, which he drops in the back of the
truck.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before 7 a.m., the tape shows, a male holding two white
plastic trash bags walks from the stairway near Castillo's apartment
and drops them in a trash bin. The male in the tape was wearing a
jacket that was later recovered from Point Mugu near the spot where
the remains of Castillo's wife were found, Senior Sheriff's Deputy
Donald Jennings testified.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Sheriff's Deputy Jason Hendren testified that he
searched a trash bin at Castillo's apartment complex Dec. 6 and found
it nearly filled with women's clothing inside plastic bags.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the clothing, he discovered Ambario's identification card,
which had been cut into small pieces, along with torn pages from an
address book and an assortment of mail addressed to her.</TE>
<TE>   A county forensic specialist also testified that several areas of
Castillo's apartment tested positive for traces of blood. Vern
Traxler with the Ventura County Sheriff's Crime Lab said he checked
the apartment with chemicals that can detect blood, and traces were
found on the kitchen sink, counter and floor, as well as on the sink
and toilet lid in the hallway bathroom, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Janice Frank, Ventura County assistant chief medical examiner,
who performed the autopsy on Ambario, testified that hemorrhages
around Ambario's eyes and at the base of her skull showed she died of
asphyxiation before being dismembered.</TE>

<DH>Feral Cats Nip a Problem in the Flower District</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The cat is out of the bag about the stealth campaign to save the
carnations in the Los Angeles flower district.</LD>
<LD>   The popular mainstay of girls' bouquets and guys' boutonnieres was
becoming a main course for rodents that sneaked into sprawling floral
markets in downtown L.A.</LD>
<LD>   "The rats like the little seeds in carnations. We'd see petals all
over the floor in the refrigerator and know they'd come in to eat,"
said grower Philip Sandoval, who sells blossoms at the Southern
California Flower Market.</LD>
<TE>   But the flower district turned to a four-legged security patrol to
put an end to the refrigerator raids.</TE>
<TE>   Not guard dogs. Guard cats.</TE>
<TE>   "The rats were scary. Somebody would scream, and you'd see a big
black thing run by," said Deb Hector, a flower buyer for Gelson's
Markets who purchases truckloads of blooms each week.</TE>
<TE>   "They weren't afraid of people--they would come out and look you
right in the eye. We'd tried poison, traps, sticky glue stuff.
Nothing worked," said Scott Yamabe, general manager of the
89-year-old Southern California Flower Market.</TE>
<TE>   "Then we tried feral cats," he said. "And the rats disappeared
almost overnight."</TE>
<TE>   Three cats have been put to work at Yamabe's warehouse-size floral
center at 755 S. Wall St. Impressed by the results, operators of the
Los Angeles Flower Market across the street have put six cats on duty
there, including two more last week.</TE>
<TE>   "I was skeptical at first--I'm a dog kind of guy," said Johnny
Mellano, general manager of the Los Angeles Flower Market.</TE>
<TE>   "Rats eat carnations. They like red and yellow ones the best,
because there's more sugar in them," he said. "We'd been fighting
them for years. We had an exterminator come in once a week and spread
powder around. But they were in coolers, everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   The guard cats were the idea of Melya Kaplan, founder and
executive director of an animal rescue group called Venice Animal
Allies.</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan shops in the district every Friday for flowers for her
Venice home. On one shopping trip two years ago, she noticed a worker
having a coughing fit.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he was reacting to the spraying they were doing for rats.
I went to the market people and told them they wouldn't have to spray
if they had cats," she said. "I think they thought I was a little
loony--it took a while to get them to agree to try it."</TE>
<TE>   Since feral "alley cats" are generally afraid of people, Kaplan's
group picked them for petal patrol duty. The first group was bailed
out of an animal shelter, neutered and then taken to the flower
district. There, they were "colonized"--kept for several weeks in
cages in a dark corner of a market building until they became
comfortable with the sights, sounds and smells of the place.</TE>
<TE>   These days they hide out during the flower marts' normal 2
a.m.-to-noon business hours. In the afternoons and evenings, when the
warehouses are closed, they emerge to patrol the empty floors and
flower stalls.</TE>
<TE>   "We never see the cats. But one of our vendors was watching a TV
surveillance monitor and actually saw one corner a rat. The rat moved
to one side and the cat followed. The rat moved again and so did the
cat. It didn't get away," Mellano said.</TE>
<TE>   The cats don't eat the rats, Kaplan said. Instead, rats are routed
from the flower marts by the scent of the felines. "You rarely see a
dead rat. If you do, you won't see bite marks. The rat was likely
scared to death," she joked.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, flower mart workers who tend to the cats' food, water
and litter boxes say they are careful not to overindulge the animals.</TE>
<TE>   "At first we fed them too much, and they got fat and lazy and
slept all the time," Mellano said.</TE>
<TE>   Across the street, Southern California Flower Market staff member
Carl Jones agreed. "If a cat ain't hungry, he ain't gonna hunt," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Police Chief Candidates Down to 13</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police commissioners narrowed the list of police chief
candidates Tuesday to 13 but declined to disclose the names, saying
they had pledged to some of the applicants to keep the process secret
until the top three are chosen next month.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a sensitivity, because they hold high positions, chief
positions in other parts of the country," said Rick Caruso, president
of the Police Commission. "Because of that, we decided it is a
priority for us to live up to our commitment."</LD>
<LD>   Some police watchdogs criticized the panel's decision to withhold
the names, saying that, at this stage of the selection process, Los
Angeles residents have a right to know who is up for consideration so
they can voice their opinions.</LD>
<TE>   "I find it distressing that this important aspect of the public's
business remains secret," said one policing expert, Merrick Bobb, who
heads the Police Assessment Resource Center. He recalled that five
years ago, when Chief Bernard C. Parks was chosen, the commission
released the names of six semifinalists. The commission then winnowed
that list to three finalists.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see why the same process should not be employed today,"
Bobb said.</TE>
<TE>   USC legal scholar Erwin Chemerinsky agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "There has to be a public discussion, not only about the criteria
but also about the individuals," he said. "When people have made
themselves candidates for one of the most important public offices in
the city, assurances for confidentiality should not apply. Openness
always leads to better discussion and thinking."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Mayor James K. Hahn, who has the final say over
who the next chief will be, declined to comment. But according to
City Hall sources, the mayor's office supports the decision to keep
the names secret, because officials believe that some of the
candidates could face retribution if current employers found out that
they applied.</TE>
<TE>   Police commissioners met in closed session nearly three hours
Tuesday to narrow the list from 21 candidates to 13. Caruso said they
would begin interviewing the 13 next Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   He told reporters that not all the remaining 13 had received the
backing of all commissioners, but that after each candidate was voted
on, the panel had voted again and unanimously approved the list.</TE>
<TE>   "It is gender-diverse; it's diverse from an ethnic standpoint,"
Caruso said. "There is a broad mix that reflects the diversity of Los
Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   But he added: "We are not going to break out any of the
percentages of ethnicity and gender." Neither would he disclose how
many of the candidates had LAPD experience.</TE>
<TE>   The city began the search for a new chief after the commission
voted in April to deny Parks a second five-year term. Former Deputy
Chief Martin Pomeroy is heading the department temporarily. Pomeroy,
who had been retired, has said he plans to return to his home in
Montana once a new chief is selected.</TE>
<TE>   Under the City Charter, the commission will select its three top
choices and forward the names to Hahn, who will make the final
decision--subject to City Council approval.</TE>
<TE>   Among the people who have announced publicly that they are seeking
the job are: Portland, Ore., Police Chief Mark Kroeker and Oxnard
Chief Art Lopez, both former LAPD deputy chiefs; LAPD Deputy Chiefs
David Kalish, David Gascon and Margaret York; LAPD Cmdrs. George
Gascon, Betty Kelepecz, Jim McDonnell and Sharon Papa; Santa Ana
Chief Paul Walters; and former New York City Police Commissioner
William Bratton.</TE>
<TE>   The commission will rank its top six candidates in case Hahn
rejects all three of its top choices and requests another three
candidates, Caruso said. He also said the commission would adhere to
the criteria created by a citizens committee in interviewing
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   At the top of the list of desired qualities is effective
leadership and the ability to inspire the LAPD's rank and file, which
was often portrayed as demoralized during Parks' tenure.</TE>

<HD>Teen Arrests, Pregnancies on Decline in O.C.</HD>
<DH>Health: Annual report also shows one-third of children live

<LD>Orange County's annual report on the state of children offers a mixed
picture: One in three children lives in poverty, but juvenile arrests
and teen pregnancies are down.</LD>
<LD>   "If I had to give the condition of children in Orange County a
letter grade, I would give them a C grade," said Douglas C. Barton,
the county's behavioral health director.</LD>
<LD>   Barton and other health-care professionals presented the eighth
annual Report on the Conditions of Children in Orange County, 2002,
at a meeting of the Board of Supervisors.</LD>
<TE>   The report was compiled over the last year by a 17-member advisory
board, which reviewed criminal statistics, medical data and other
resources. The numbers were from 2000 and, when available, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The study found some improvements. Juvenile arrests, which peaked
at 19,164 in 1996, dropped 19% in 2000 to 15,528.</TE>
<TE>   The teen birthrate has dropped to 43 per 1,000 teen mothers in
2001 from a high of 62 per 1,000 in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Other highlights included:</TE>
<TE>   * A slight increase in infants born with low birth weight.</TE>
<TE>   Babies with low birth weight can be an indication that pregnant
mothers are not getting access to any kind of medical care during
their pregnancy, said Dr. Sudeep Kukreja, associate director at
Children's Hospital of Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "These mothers are at a higher risk of delivering babies
prematurely," Kukreja said.</TE>
<TE>   * Among sexually transmitted diseases, rates declined for
gonorrhea and syphilis but rose for chlamydia.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said more education and awareness programs are needed
because health-care professionals have not focused on chlamydia as
much as gonorrhea and syphilis.</TE>
<TE>   Kukreja said most pregnant women are tested for gonorrhea and
syphilis but not for chlamydia, unless they're experiencing symptoms
like discharge, itching and fever. "It's preventable," he said. "But
ultimately it ends up as an issue of health education, availability
and access to health care."</TE>
<TE>   * About 15% of low-income children visiting health clinics in 2000
were overweight.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1991, the rate of overweight children in the county has gone
up by nearly 14%, a much higher rate than the state average,
officials said. The concern is that as children become overweight
they suffer from related medical and social problems.</TE>
<TE>   Poor eating habits developed in childhood and adolescence may lead
to such diseases as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and hypertension
as adults, health-care professionals say.</TE>
<TE>   According to the report, the greatest increases in overweight
youth occurred between ages 10 and 12. There was a 228% increase for
Asian/Pacific Islanders since 1991, followed by non-Hispanic whites
with a 145% increase and Latinos with a 36% rise.</TE>
<TE>   Those increases were most likely attributable to eating fast foods
and getting calories from foods high in sugar and fat, said Dr.
Margaret Beed, the county's public health chief medical officer.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of all, they're sitting on the couch watching TV or playing
Nintendo and there's a whole lot of research with people about that,"
Beed said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about dieting," she said. "It's about exercising and
eating the right things."</TE>
<TE>   Of the county's 768,419 children younger than 17, Barton said
about 250,000 have no access to health insurance. "That's astounding
in a county this wealthy," he said, adding that the working poor
often don't earn health benefits.</TE>
<TE>   A forum among health-care advocates to discuss strategies and
solutions is scheduled for Oct. 1 at Cal State Fullerton, Barton
said.</TE>

<HD>Teachers Feel Students' Pain in Math Seminar</HD>
<DH>Elementary, middle school educators stretch mental muscles
tackling geometry concepts.</DH>

<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sitting in a small group, with brightly colored construction paper
strewn across the desk, Janet Barlet stared at the task before her.
And her mind went blank.</LD>
<LD>   Why can't you make a Platonic solid using congruent hexagons?</LD>
<LD>   Barlet, a fourth-grade teacher at Berylwood Elementary School in
Simi Valley, felt her anxiety level rising. She found herself talking
to the other teachers at her table, giggling and generally acting
silly.</LD>
<TE>   Then it hit her.</TE>
<TE>   "This is letting us know how our students feel when they're not
getting something," said Barlet, one of about 60 elementary and
middle school teachers from Ventura County who attended a weeklong
math workshop earlier this month at Cal Lutheran University in
Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to feel that discomfort."</TE>
<TE>   A joint effort by Cal Lutheran and the new Cal State Channel
Islands in Camarillo, the program is aimed at improving math
education in the elementary and middle school grades by reeducating
teachers in focused subjects.</TE>
<TE>   "You hear about math scores being low--this is one way to address
that," said Jackie Gilmore, an education professor at Cal State
Channel Islands and co-director of the project.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many other teacher training programs, in which educators
learn new ways to teach basic subjects they already understand, the
workshop's eight-hour sessions covered university-level concepts in
geometry that were new to most of the participants.</TE>
<TE>   As such, teachers won't take everything they learned at the
workshop back to their classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   After all, no kindergarten class will be charged with figuring out
the volume of a trapezoid.</TE>
<TE>   But the idea, Gilmore said, is that elementary-level teachers can
do a better job of teaching the basics if they understand what is
required of students in high school and college.</TE>
<TE>   "If that foundation isn't laid properly, kids can have trouble in
math later on," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Added Cindy Wyels, professor of mathematics at Cal Lutheran and
one of the lead teachers at the workshop: "It's knowing how to do
elementary math versus having a deep understanding of why it works
and how to teach it effectively."</TE>
<TE>   On the second day of the workshop, for example, teachers learned
about Euler's formula--a complex mathematical theory that spells out
the relationship among the number of corners, edges and faces of
three-dimensional figures. But rather than simply memorize the
formula, they had to figure out why it makes sense.</TE>
<TE>   "This is definitely mental calisthenics," said Holly Dye, a
fourth-grade teacher at Simi Elementary School in Simi Valley. "It's
very challenging."</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Fry, a fifth-grade teacher at Meadows Elementary School
in Thousand Oaks, and many other workshop participants said it had
been 10 years since their last real math class. But the concepts were
so foreign, Fry felt like it had been 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's horrible," she said. "The roles are reversed."</TE>
<TE>   To help teachers grasp the concepts, each day of the program began
with a warmup problem-solving activity, usually something hands-on,
that tied into a two-hour lecture that afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   On the day that Wyels taught Euler's formula, the morning
consisted of cutting out simple shapes and pasting them together into
three-dimensional solids.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers soon learned that they could make solids with squares,
triangles and pentagons, but when they got to hexagons, the pieces
wouldn't fit together. Many didn't understand why until the afternoon
lecture, when Wyels explained the mathematical theory behind it: The
angles of a Platonic solid must add up to less than 360 degrees. That
means six-sided figures won't work.</TE>
<TE>   "Aha!" the room exclaimed.</TE>
<TE>   After lunch, teachers broke into two groups.</TE>
<TE>   One practiced math software in the computer lab. The other figured
out how the day's lessons could be applied to children in each grade
level.</TE>
<TE>   Those teachers worked on word problems that would be suitable for
sixth-, seventh-and eight-graders and devised activities that would
make sense to kindergartners, such as figuring out volumes by pouring
rice into hollow shapes.</TE>
<TE>   While subject-matter workshops for teachers are common in
California, officials said the Ventura County project is different
for two reasons: the fact that two universities are teaming up, and
that university professors--not K-12 teachers--are leading the
sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Funded bya three-year grant from the state, the workshop also
offered a $100-per-day stipend for teachers who participated. Some
also signed up for continuing education credits--needed for teachers
to move up the pay scale.</TE>
<TE>   Conejo Valley Unified School District teacher Chris DiPietro said
even the first few days of the workshop gave him a deeper grasp of
geometric concepts.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of things that teachers just know the answers to
because we've memorized them," said DiPietro, who has taught fifth
grade for six years.</TE>
<TE>   "This helps me understand the underlying logic behind the
answers."</TE>
<TE>   That understanding is more important since state education
guidelines have come to require that tougher geometry concepts be
taught in primary grades.</TE>
<TE>   Many teachers with elementary school credentials don't have the
background for that, Wyels said.</TE>
<TE>   That's where the math workshop comes in.</TE>
<TE>   "The way technology is going now, kids need to be exposed to
three-dimensional figures and have an understanding of these things
very early on," said Ivona Grzegorczyk, a mathematics professor at
Cal State Channel Islands and the workshop's other lead teacher.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just triangles anymore."</TE>

<KH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</KH>
<HD>Governor Sits Out the Budget Standoff</HD>
<DH>State: Some legislators say Davis should switch focus from
fund-raising to impasse, which could drag past election day.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Oregon Gov. John A. Kitzhaber sent his regrets that he couldn't
attend a recent gathering of Democratic governors. He was stuck up in
Salem because of that state's budget crisis.</LD>
<LD>   California Gov. Gray Davis, in the midst of an even worse crisis,
took time out to make the trip. In fact, before heading to Los
Angeles for the weekend, Davis on successive days last week spent an
afternoon planning election strategy with Democratic governors at the
Fairmont Hotel here, appeared at the state fair to tout television
ads boosting California agriculture and announced a campaign to get
tough on corporate misdeeds.</LD>
<LD>   The deadline for having a budget in place came and went on July 1,
start of the new fiscal year. But the Democratic governor is distant
from the most pressing policy issue of the day in Sacramento--a
budget deficit of historic proportions.</LD>
<TE>   By leaving negotiations largely to legislators, Davis is shielding
himself from being associated with a major problem, political
observers say. Increasing numbers of lawmakers believe he must get
more heavily involved if the standoff is going to end any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   All along, the governor has been in full reelection campaign mode.</TE>
<TE>   Last Tuesday when he appeared at the Fairmont, the Democratic
Governors' Assn. gave Davis' reelection campaign another $200,000,
pushing its total contribution to Davis to $650,000 since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, Davis raised $2.8 million during the first 23 days of
August, nearly three times what had been his average haul of $1
million a month. He and his wife, Sharon, even took time earlier this
month for a fund-raising swing through Austin, Texas, where he raised
about $150,000.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, lawmakers and Davis will break the record 62-day
standoff set in 1992, when Republican Gov. Pete Wilson did not sign a
budget until Sept. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Though Republican and Democratic legislators continue to talk,
some experts fear that if there's no spending plan in place when the
legislative session is scheduled to end on Saturday, the state could
enter uncharted territory, perhaps going without a budget until after
the November election. "The governor has a political strategy of
trying to kick the budget ball past the November election," Senate
Republican leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga said, contending
that the solutions are so severe that the governor would lose
electoral support if voters became more aware of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he believes the budget impasse will go on past the
Nov. 5 election, Davis said: "I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   The Assembly Republican and Democratic caucuses each have retained
outside political consultants to handle budget strategy, an
indication to some Capitol insiders that negotiations could drag into
the fall election season. Former Wilson aide Dan Schnur is advising
Assembly GOP leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks. Gale Kaufman, onetime aide
to former Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, and Democratic consultant
Darry Sragow are advising Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver
City). Schnur and Kaufman are veterans of Wilson-era budget fights.</TE>
<TE>   Competing Fiscal Plans</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, while Davis was accepting endorsements from law
enforcement and crime victims groups, Assembly Democrats and
Republicans offered competing proposals to end the impasse.</TE>
<TE>   Although the two sides remained $3.5 billion apart, Wesson said
Davis' intervention is not necessary. The speaker contends that his
plan of deeper cuts and spending caps will reduce, if not eliminate,
deficits in future years.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, who hope to draw Davis more directly into the fray,
countered by offering to agree to raise revenue by $500 million--they
don't call the proposal a tax hike. But the GOP plan falls far short
of the $4.2 billion in tax hikes that Democrats have proposed.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have a significant gap," said Assemblyman John Campbell
(R-Irvine), the Assembly Republicans' point man on budget matters.</TE>
<TE>   As it stands, California and Kentucky are the only states without
a budget, according to the National Assn. of Budget Officers.
California's shortfall of $23.6 billion, a number that includes last
year's deficit and the projected gap for 2002-03, is roughly half the
total shortfall for all other states combined before their budgets
were settled this year.</TE>
<TE>   "California is, if not at the top, near the top among all states
in terms of fiscal stress," said Scott Pattison, executive director
of the National Assn. of State Budget Officers, a nonpartisan group
in Washington, D.C. "It is among the hardest hit, and faces one of
the most dire fiscal situations that any state is facing."</TE>
<TE>   Davis accuses Assembly Republicans of being unwilling to
negotiate: "It is clear to me that Assembly Republicans are not
interested in solving problems. They just are fixated against any tax
of any sort, even a tax on smokers. You can't fill a $23-billion
shortfall without some revenue increases."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans counter that Davis' budget won't solve the state's
fiscal problem. They point to the legislative analyst office's
estimate that, if lawmakers approve the spending plan proposed by
Davis, the state will face multibillion-dollar deficits for years to
come. Davis' own Department of Finance has asked departments to plan
for 20% cuts starting next year.</TE>
<TE>   Some fellow Democrats grumble that Davis must become more deeply
involved if the state is to have a budget any time soon. The
phone-book-size document, after all, is titled "The Governor's
Budget."</TE>
<TE>   "It is on a flat spin right now," Sen. Don Perata (D-Alameda)
said. "The governor has to step up. If he gets some of these
[holdouts] in his office and applies a little pressure their heads
would pop off."</TE>
<TE>   Not all the implications of a delay past election day are known.
But Controller Kathleen Connell, who must pay the state's bills,
warns that the state could run out of cash by October, when she must
begin repaying a $7.5-billion short-term loan. Wall Street rating
agencies could downgrade California's credit, which would cost the
state millions more in interest payments when it tries to borrow
money, Connell and others say.</TE>
<TE>   More directly, hundreds of private vendors who sell products to
state government cannot be paid until a budget is place, and spending
cuts and tax hikes that were part of the Davis' budget proposal and
were supposed to take effect in July and August are adding $5 million
a day to the state's deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "Here we are in third week of August and we are worlds apart,
philosophical canyons apart," Connell said, adding that Davis
"absolutely" should become more directly involved.</TE>
<TE>   Budget standoffs are nothing new in Sacramento. In the 1990s,
Wilson routinely failed to have a signed budget in place by the July
1 deadline. But during those fights, Wilson remained in Sacramento,
presiding over closed-door meetings of the legislative leaders that
went long into the night and often spilled into weekends.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand how [Davis] can cavalierly ignore the process
you are supposed to lead," Wilson said in an interview, adding that
by avoiding leadership talks, Davis is "trying to sell to the public
that this is not his problem."</TE>
<TE>   From appearances, Davis' task would seem easier than Wilson's.
Wilson, a Republican, dealt with a Legislature controlled by the
opposing party. Democrat Davis is dealing with overwhelming
majorities of Democrats in both houses. With the Senate having
already approved the spending plan, Davis needs only four Republican
votes to attain the necessary two-thirds majority in the 80-seat
Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has not met with Brulte, the most influential Republican in
Sacramento, and has had only a few meetings with Assembly GOP leader
Cox.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's strategy of winning Senate approval, where
Democrats hold 26 of the 40 seats, then obtaining a handful of votes
from Republicans in the Assembly, has failed so far.</TE>
<TE>   Targeting Republicans</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge) is among the Republicans
targeted by the administration as one who might vote for the spending
plan. Richman, however, left the conversations resolute in his
opposition to Davis' budget, saying his suggestions for more cuts and
different approaches to tax increases failed to budge Davis or other
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't pick me off," Richman said. "They haven't moved one
bit. They're unwilling to negotiate in a constructive manner. In
fact, I'm not even sure if they know how to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the delay, there is little outward sense of urgency to
attain a budget deal.</TE>
<TE>   One reason is that virtually all lawmakers running for reelection
have safe seats. Few fear they will lose their elections by failing
to approve the budget.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Republicans who might consider voting for the
governor's budget know they would face their party's wrath. Senate
Republicans banished from their caucus the lone Republican who has
voted for the spending plan, outgoing Sen. Maurice Johannessen
(R-Redding).</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the lack of a budget has caused almost no pain for
most California voters. Virtually no one other than private vendors
has noticed there is no budget. And though budget gridlock in the
early 1990s was major news and hurt Wilson, this year's impasse has
attracted far less attention. That may be attributed in part to how
Davis has handled the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "Davis and his advisors decided that the reason Pete Wilson was
hurt was because of the extent to which he involved himself in the
budget," Schnur said. "The governor and his aides have decided that
by keeping him at arm's length, he can protect himself against any
short-term political damage."</TE>

<HD>Demands by Davis Threaten Bill to License Immigrant
Drivers</HD>
<DH>Politics: Backers of measure benefiting illegal immigrants
say safeguards are unfair.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A proposed compromise aimed at inducing Gov. Gray Davis to sign
legislation allowing illegal immigrants to obtain California drivers'
licenses faced a new and potentially fatal firestorm of opposition
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Legislators who voted for the bill last year, including Senate
leader John L. Burton (D-San Francisco), criticized a second bill
intended to settle the controversy as an unfair remedy that would
make California immigrants the scapegoats for the terrorist attacks
of Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   Although some of the terrorists obtained phony driver's licenses,
several lawmakers said they saw no connection between licensing
illegal immigrants to drive and acts of domestic terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   At one point in a committee hearing, Burton suggested that the
Democratic governor got interested in the immigrant driver's license
bill earlier this month only when an equally controversial bill
sought by the United Farm Workers of America was passed by the
Legislature. Davis aides have indicated he may veto that bill.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate Public Safety Committee heard witnesses from both sides
of the driver's license issue but delayed a vote on the proposal (AB
1206) by Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles) until today.
However, members of the committee said that, without extensive
amendments, the proposed compromise was unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is the long-running fight over whether more than 800,000
illegal immigrants should be licensed to drive in California. Police
chiefs and insurance companies favor licensing them in the interest
of enhanced highway safety.</TE>
<TE>   But immigration reform advocates assert that the state has no
business allowing someone who got into this country by breaking the
law to be eligible for a privilege reserved for law-abiding
residents.</TE>
<TE>   On its third try, the Legislature last year approved licensing
qualified illegal immigrants to drive, provided they were in the
process of becoming legal residents and were paying federal taxes.
But when the bill reached Davis, he balked at signing it, voicing
concern that such a law would relax security safeguards at a time
that the country was trying to improve security.</TE>
<TE>   However, Davis indicated last week that he would sign the bill if
the Legislature quickly drafted and passed legislation to provide
additional safeguards.</TE>
<TE>   These would include subjecting license applicants to criminal
background checks of state and federal sources, requiring applicants
to have worked at least 15 months during the previous three years and
creating an information exchange between the state Department of
Motor Vehicles and the federal Immigration and Naturalization
Service.</TE>
<TE>   The freshly written compromise bill, which contained many but not
all of the governor's demands, was criticized by opposition witnesses
and committee members, including Burton, the most powerful Democrat
in the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, they challenged the constitutionality of
several provisions, noting that no other driver's license applicant
is subject to a criminal background investigation or is required to
produce evidence of employment.</TE>
<TE>   Burton told Cedillo, author of last year's bill as well as of the
proposed compromise, that the governor's demands for more safeguards
"make it improbable that many people will get a driver's license,"
even if Cedillo's bill becomes law.</TE>
<TE>   Burton said Davis should sign the original bill, AB 60, without
insisting on potentially unlawful safeguards. "If it was signed, the
world wouldn't come to an end; people wouldn't be driving around
blowing up buildings and airports and capitols," he said.</TE>

<KH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</KH>
<HD>State Prison Guards Union Endorses Davis</HD>
<DH>Politics: The backing could add $1 million to his campaign.
Simon's camp says it typifies a 'pay to play' system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>California's powerful prison guards union formally endorsed Gov. Gray
Davis' reelection Tuesday, after spending $2 million to help elect
Davis in 1998 and winning a pay hike from the Davis administration of
as much as 37% earlier this year.</LD>
<LD>   The endorsement by the California Correctional Peace Officers
Assn. will bring with it hefty spending on Davis' behalf, perhaps
adding more than $1 million to the $58.7 million the governor has
raised since he took office in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Davis signed legislation in January granting the union one of its
long-held goals--pay parity with the California Highway Patrol and
major local police agencies in the state. Depending on the size of
raises granted to the CHP and major police departments, the union's
26,000 members could receive pay raises of as much as 37% spread over
five years. Officers' annual pay could rise to more than $73,000, not
including overtime, from the current $54,000.</LD>
<TE>   Two months after Davis signed the legislation, the union donated
$251,000 to his reelection. It has since donated $50,000 more to his
campaign, pushing the total amount it has given Davis since he took
office to $712,000.</TE>
<TE>   Davis defended the contract with the prison workers, and contracts
with other state law enforcement agencies and firefighters, and said
he "emphatically" denies that campaign donations had bought influence
in his administration.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to attract and retain good people to do this
difficult work, you have to pay a competitive wage, and we'll now be
doing that," Davis said, standing at the union's headquarters in West
Sacramento, flanked by family members of murder victims.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Davis' Republican challenger, Bill Simon Jr., said
the endorsement underscores what Simon characterizes as a "pay to
play" atmosphere in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very clear that, in order to get a pay raise, the
correctional officers had to donate to the Davis campaign large sums
of money and, even worse, endorse him," said Simon's spokesman, Mark
Miner. "It is unfortunate that the only way you can do business with
the Davis administration is to donate to his campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Jimenez, who recently took over from the prison workers
union's longtime president, Don Novey, said he would have pushed for
Davis' endorsement even if the union had not won the contract.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly," Jimenez said, "there was no comparison" between Davis
and Simon.</TE>
<TE>   The California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. has a reputation
of siding with winners, unseating legislators who cross it and
helping to sway races that otherwise might be tight.</TE>
<TE>   The union offers candidates law enforcement's imprimatur. It also
funds organizations that represent crime victims, who offer their own
testimonials for candidates. More important, the union is a major
campaign spender and tactically shrewd.</TE>
<TE>   "They're very good at what they do," said a Davis campaign
strategist, Garry South.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the union was particularly active on Davis' behalf in the
Central Valley, a swing part of the state that Republicans had won in
recent elections. Davis captured the valley. Also in 1998, the union
struck an alliance with Indian tribes that operate lucrative casinos.
The Native Americans and Peace Officers Political Action Committee
spent $512,000 on Davis' behalf. As of June 30, the PAC had $550,000
in its accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The union's signature fund-raiser is the so-called Governor's Cup
Invitational, a golf tournament held at Pebble Beach. Business and
labor Interest groups pay as much as $25,000 to participate. The
union bundles the money and donates it to the governor. As of June
30, the Governor's Cup committee had $263,000 in its account, ready
to spend.</TE>

<HD>Hospital Error Cited in Man's Death</HD>
<DH>Stabbing: Coroner says victim of an alleged hate crime by
gang members was given massive dose of an anticoagulant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new report on the death of a man stabbed outside a Riverside gay
bar in an alleged hate crime reveals that the man may have bled to
death because of hospital error.</LD>
<LD>   A nurse accidentally gave Jeffery Owens 100,000 units of an
anticoagulant drug--100 times the recommended dose--according to a
report this week by the Riverside County coroner's office. With his
blood unable to clot, Owens bled to death at Riverside County
Regional Medical Center in Moreno Valley, the report said.</LD>
<LD>   The coroner's report paints a picture of a confused emergency
room, where the nurse was unsure of the proper dosage of the
medication and couldn't find help from colleagues.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Tuesday the hospital's error does not lessen the
culpability of five Riverside alleged gang members charged with
Owens' murder.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Anne Corrado said her office will vigorously
pursue murder convictions against the defendants, adding: "Were it
not for the stab wound, he would not be dead."</TE>
<TE>   But at least one criminal law expert, Los Angeles trial attorney
Howard Weitzman, said the hospital's mistakes could make it more
difficult to obtain convictions.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess some could argue that, but for the actions of the
defendants, [Owens] wouldn't be in the hospital and the death
wouldn't have occurred," Weitzman said. "But I think that's a real
stretch."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Soccio, a spokesman for the Riverside County district
attorney's office, acknowledged that the coroner's findings "could
make the case more difficult, because it confuses the issue." But, he
added, "It's up to us to help the jury to stay on track. The fact is,
someone was murdered here."</TE>
<TE>   The coroner's report lists the "inadvertent administration of
excessive heparin," the anticoagulant, as a "significant condition"
in Owens' death.</TE>
<TE>   But Corrado said the district attorney's case will be aided by the
fact that the coroner's report still lists the stabbing as the cause
of death.</TE>
<TE>   On June 5, the 40-year-old Owens and friends were leaving the
Menagerie, a gay nightclub in downtown Riverside. The Moreno Valley
man was stabbed five times and a friend, Michael Bussee, 48, was
punched in the face and stabbed.</TE>
<TE>   Police called the attack a hate crime and later arrested five
alleged gang members, including Dorian Lee Gutierrez, 18, suspected
of being the one who stabbed Owens.</TE>
<TE>   A preliminary hearing is set for Sept. 25.</TE>
<TE>   Owens, unaware of how badly he was injured, drove himself to the
hospital emergency room. According to the coroner's report, doctors
there considered his wounds moderately serious.</TE>
<TE>   As Owens continued to bleed. Dr. David Bolivar decided to give
Owens a transfusion with his own blood. Bolivar, a surgical resident,
ordered a nurse to administer the anticoagulant heparin in
preparation for the transfusion. The nurse, Patricia Forst, said she
asked Bolivar how much heparin she should use but the doctor did not
know, according to the coroner's report.</TE>
<TE>   The nurse told investigators she then called the hospital's blood
bank and pharmacy for guidance. Neither department knew the proper
dosage.</TE>
<TE>   Forst said she couldn't remember what happened next, but
ultimately she began administering 100,000 units of the drug, the
report said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody ever gave me any direction," Forst told coroner's
investigators. "I thought I was giving him 1,000 units, that's what
the protocol is."</TE>
<TE>   The hospital's medical director, Dr. Benson W. Harer, said in an
interview Tuesday that "the nurse guessed and she made a bad guess."</TE>
<TE>   Forst has been placed on administrative leave pending an internal
hospital investigation, Harer said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Forst nor Bolivar could be reached for comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Owens survived the surgery and seemed to stabilize, the report
said. But as morning approached, he was bleeding profusely. Surgeons
thought he still had an open wound and rushed him back into surgery.
He died in the operating room.</TE>
<TE>   "There was just generalized oozing [of blood] from everywhere,"
said Dr. Arnold Tabuenca, according to the report. "There was not one
place that was bleeding."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors at first thought Owens suffered from a condition that
prevents the blood from clotting.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until two weeks later, when Bolivar overheard nurses
talking about the possibility of a heparin overdose, that hospital
administrators became aware of what had happened.</TE>
<TE>   Harer, the hospital medical director, said he notified Owens'
family immediately of the mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Family members could not be reached for comment Tuesday. They have
not yet filed a claim with the county, which operates the hospital,
said Riverside County spokesman Ray Smith.</TE>
<TE>   "Accidents happen all the time in medicine," Harer said. "But
usually there aren't such big repercussions."</TE>

<HD>County Youths Savor the Final Day of Summer</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Many students head back to school today, but
not without getting in some last-minute rest and relaxation.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tuesday could have been like any other summer day at Golf N' Stuff in
Ventura, as kids of all ages bounded from miniature golf to bumper
boats to Indy cars.</LD>
<LD>   But for many of the youngsters, the day marked the last hours of
freedom before the dawn of the school year.</LD>
<LD>   School resumes today for the majority of students in the county,
including those in Ventura, Camarillo, Simi Valley, Moorpark and Oak
Park.</LD>
<TE>   While many children cringed at the thought of alarm clocks and
homework, others expressed some eagerness.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sort of looking forward to going back to school," said
11-year-old Elizabeth Abate of Oak Park. "I've had a lot of fun this
summer, but I'm really excited about seeing all of my friends again."</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth's twin sister, Emily, was a little less enthusiastic
about starting seventh grade at Medea Creek Middle School.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I want to go back, but I really want to keep sleeping in,
too," said Emily as she played miniature golf with her sister, father
and younger brother, who is starting kindergarten at Brookside
Elementary School.</TE>
<TE>   Six-year-old John Abate could only vigorously shake his head "No!"
when asked if he was excited about starting school.</TE>
<TE>   "He may not be excited, but their mother sure is," the children's
father, Paul Abate, said with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Across the course, the girls in the Farzaneh family chatted
excitedly about starting school today.</TE>
<TE>   With parents in tow, 6-year-old Kayla, 5-year-old Megan and
2-year-old Taylor were spending their last day of summer with a
first-time crack at miniature golf.</TE>
<TE>   "I get to go to school!" exclaimed Megan, who will be at Brookside
in Oak Park.</TE>
<TE>   Kayla said she also was excited about starting first grade at
Brookside, but expressed some concern over the school's vacation
policy.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing I'm not going to like about school is that they won't
let you get out of school for vacation, so I'm going to miss my
cousin's birthday party in Las Vegas," she said. "But we've done all
kinds of fun things this summer, like going to Disneyland."</TE>
<TE>   Westlake High School freshmen Adam Hickman and Max Wellman were
among the older youths at the popular Ventura hangout Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   After spending their summers vacationing in Hawaii, Palm Springs,
Chicago and San Diego, the best friends chose to spend their
second-to-last day of freedom a bit closer to home, which is Westlake
for Adam and Newbury Park for Max.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done everything there is to do in Westlake--and there isn't
much to do except go to the movies," said 14-year-old Adam, an
aspiring golfer who wanted to hone his putting skills.</TE>
<TE>   While Max has to be on the football field for practice at 7 a.m.
today, Adam said he planned on sleeping in and doing nothing all day
in preparation for Thursday's start at Westlake High School.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a fun summer, but I guess it's time to go back," Adam
said with a shrug.</TE>
<TE>   While Golf N' Stuff was packed with people enjoying the sun and
games, it was a little less crowded at Marina Park in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   That suited JoAnn Callahan of Ventura just fine as she watched
granddaughters Lexie and Nikki Sather and Amy Harris playing in the
sand.</TE>
<TE>   "My friend was visiting, so I thought we'd bring the girls out for
some fun before they started school," Callahan said. "It's nice that
it's not too crowded."</TE>
<TE>   For 6-year-old Lexie, 5-year-old Nikki and 8-year-old Amy, it was
all business as they studiously built sand castles by the water.</TE>
<TE>   After talking about a summer filled with trips to a science museum
in Berkeley, the top of the Stratosphere in Las Vegas and Lazerstar
in Oxnard, all three girls said they were ready to go back to school.</TE>
<TE>   "I really like school," said Lexie, a second-grader at Poinsettia
Elementary in Ventura. "Math is my favorite. Plus I like seeing my
friends."</TE>
<TE>   East county kids were doing their best to enjoy summer's waning
days as well.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven-year-olds Ben Wilson of Simi Valley and Blake Warnick of
Carlsbad spent Ben's last day of freedom skateboarding on the
sidewalks of an outdoor shopping center on Tapo Canyon Road--and
thinking about how much they would miss hanging out.</TE>
<TE>   Peering into the deserted box office of a theater Tuesday morning,
they thought they might catch a movie, perhaps the surfing flick
"Blue Crush." Or maybe they would just skate around. All they knew
for sure was the clock was ticking toward the start of school today.</TE>
<TE>   "Summer should be longer," said Ben, who starts sixth grade at
Sinaloa Middle School in Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   His friend Blake, who has another week to go before school starts,
tried to offer some words of encouragement.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't give you homework on the first day of school," he told
Ben, who nodded in agreement.</TE>
<TE>   If anyone welcomes the start of school, it is parents, who will be
liberated from the burden of keeping their easily bored children
occupied on long summer days.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad for them to go back," said Sue Ives, whose 15-year-old
daughter, Kelly, starts 10th grade today at Simi Valley High School.
"I've been driving kids back and forth from activities all summer."</TE>
<TE>   Ives sat on the bleachers at Rancho Santa Susana Community Park in
Simi Valley as Kelly, a starting pitcher on the school's junior
varsity softball team, took a private pitching lesson from a softball
coach.</TE>
<TE>   But Ives knew her driving services were not quite exhausted: "She
wants to go to the beach. Of course I'm going to take her--it's her
last day of summer."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Reserve General in Plea Deal</HD>
<DH>Courts: He pleads guilty to obstructing justice in illegal
payments case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A retired U.S. Air Force Reserve brigadier general pleaded guilty to
obstruction of justice Tuesday in connection with a probe into
allegations that he had taken illegal gratuities from a hotel
manager.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Leigh Tate, 67, faces six to 12 months in prison under
terms of a plea bargain reached just hours before the case was to go
to trial in U.S. District Court.</LD>
<LD>   Tate, who lives in Irvine, headed the Western regional office of
the U.S. Defense Systems Management College in El Segundo, which
provides training to military officers and civilians responsible for
acquiring weapons systems.</LD>
<TE>   In 1998, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service launched an
investigation into a report that a local hotel manager had paid Tate
for information about students scheduled to attend the college. The
hotel allegedly used the information to solicit their business.</TE>
<TE>   The obstruction of justice charge stemmed from a conversation in
which Tate told the manager to destroy a check register showing he
was paid for student names. The manager, who was cooperating with
investigators, wore a concealed tape recorder.</TE>
<TE>   Tate had acknowledged receiving about $4,000 from the manager, but
denied it was in exchange for lists of students who would be
attending the college.</TE>
<TE>   Tate's attorney, Scott Furstman, said his client plowed most of
the money back into the college.</TE>
<TE>   The general was originally indicted on additional charges of
accepting illegal gratuities, but those allegations were dropped by
the U.S. attorney's office last month.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. David Vaughn said that if the case had gone
to trial, the hotel manager was prepared to testify he paid Tate
about $20,000 for student information between 1996 and 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Tate, who is free on bond, will be sentenced Nov. 18.</TE>

<HD>Stanley Greenberg, 74; Writer Inaugurated Docudrama Genre</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stanley R. Greenberg, the meticulous writer who sparked the
now-ubiquitous television genre of the docudrama in the early 1970s
with his groundbreaking teleplays "Pueblo" and "The Missiles of
October," has died. He was 74.</LD>
<LD>   Greenberg, who liked to call the form the "theater of fact," died
Sunday at his home in the Northern California community of
Kensington. Irv Wilson, a producer and a close friend, said the cause
of death was a brain tumor.</LD>
<LD>   "If one could point to where the modern vogue for the factual
drama, the so-called docudrama, emerged from," former Times
television columnist Cecil Smith wrote in 1979, "it would be
Greenberg's typewriter--specifically, his brilliant 1973 play,
'Pueblo,' followed ... by his searing drama of John Kennedy's 13
fearful days: 'The Missiles of October.' Not only were both superb
programs, which attracted enormous audiences, but both had a hard
historical accuracy widely admired by scholars."</LD>
<TE>   "Pueblo," the story of the capture of an American spy ship off
North Korea, was originally written as a stage play produced by
Washington, D.C.'s Arena Stage Theater. After Greenberg converted the
script for television, the production starring Hal Holbrook earned
several Emmys and a Peabody Award.</TE>
<TE>   "The Missiles of October," about the Cuban missile crisis, which
almost plunged the U.S. and the Soviet Union--and the world--into
nuclear war in 1963, was also critically acclaimed.</TE>
<TE>   In 1979, Greenberg presented another of his mammoth teleplays, the
eight-hour "Blind Ambition," based on John Dean's book about how the
Watergate conspiracy unraveled, toppling the Nixon White House. To
gather material, Greenberg taped 60 hours of conversations with Dean
and Dean's wife, Maureen, in addition to devouring their respective
books, "Blind Ambition" and "Mo."</TE>
<TE>   Actual historical names, dates and events were key to Greenberg's
"theater of fact," but not enough. Perhaps even more important, he
said, was "the element of morality ... so that we can understand our
times and clarify our values."</TE>
<TE>   Greenberg often joked, after imitators began to flood television
networks with docudrama scripts, that he had spawned a monster. But
he nevertheless continued to champion the genre for its ability to
carry out his personal commitment to social justice and political
causes. He had worked with American Zionist groups to promote
independence for Israel, marched in Washington with the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. to advocate civil rights, and was active in the
antinuclear movement called SANE freeze.</TE>
<TE>   "If the only purpose of historical drama is to record history, to
be illustrated textbooks, then there is no reason to dramatize the
material," Greenberg told The Times in 1979. "Then it is better to do
them as straight documentaries. But once you get into the human
dimension, once you get into the idea of the individual as a hero who
is bound by some kind of moral or ethical code, then you have to
dramatize it."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Chicago, Greenberg served in the military during World War
II and then attended Brown University on the GI Bill. By 1961, he was
living in Gary, Ind., working as a press agent for Zionist groups
when he became a fan of the new television series, "The Defenders."</TE>
<TE>   Greenberg was so moved by the quality and moral stance of the show
about father-and-son lawyers that he wrote a script and mailed it to
the show's creator, Reginald Rose. Amazingly for the television
business, Rose read the unsolicited offering and called Greenberg to
say, "We'll buy this one and any more that you can do."</TE>
<TE>   Greenberg became one of the primary writers for the series, which
ran on CBS from 1961 through 1965.</TE>
<TE>   His scripts earned an Emmy and an Edgar Allen Poe Citation from
the Mystery Writers of America.</TE>
<TE>   Although Greenberg is best known as a television writer, he also
wrote the screenplays for two popular motion pictures, "Skyjacked,"
alternately titled "Sky Terror," starring Charlton Heston in 1972,
and "Soylent Green" starring Heston and, in his last screen
appearance, Edward G. Robinson, in 1973. "Soylent Green" earned a
Nebula Award from the Science Fiction Writers of America for
screenwriter Greenberg and Harry Harrison, who wrote the book on
which it was based.</TE>
<TE>   The writer is survived by his wife of 48 years, Tamara Robbin
Greenberg; three daughters, Robin, Rachel and Ruthie; and six
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Third-Strike Offender Gets 80 Years to Life for Rapes,
Assaults</HD>
<DH>Crime: The Canoga Park man, a onetime police cadet, met the
three women on the Internet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Canoga Park man was sentenced Tuesday to 80 years to life in state
prison for raping and assaulting three women he met over the
Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Terry Smerling also ordered
Daniel Zabuski, a registered sex offender, to pay $500 in
restitution.</LD>
<LD>   Zabuski, 42, was convicted in February. He is a third-strike
offender with prior convictions on sex offenses dating to 1983.</LD>
<TE>   The onetime police cadet gained notoriety in 1986 when a judge
ruled that prostitutes cannot be raped and threw out a case against
him. In another case, Zabuski sexually assaulted two teenage girls
while posing as a talent scout. He served nine years in state prison
on that case and was released in September 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent attacks occurred in Burbank and Canoga Park
between October 1999 and March 2000. He was arrested in April 2000 on
suspicion of raping one woman. After the case was publicized, three
others came forward and said that he also assaulted them.</TE>
<TE>   The trial, which took place in Pasadena, lasted one month.</TE>
<TE>   According to Deputy Dist. Atty. Amy Suehiro, Zabuski met the women
on the Internet. He got to know one woman in an online chat room for
people interested in dominant and submissive sex. He contacted the
others through America Online's instant messaging system after
reading their user profiles.</TE>
<TE>   When he met them in person, he sexually assaulted them. Two of the
women were attacked at Zabuski's home in Canoga Park and one at her
Canoga Park residence. A fourth case, which prompted a 6-6 deadlock,
involved a woman who said she was attacked at a Burbank hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney James Barnes argued that Zabuski had consensual
sex with each woman and that the women had wanted to engage in
sadomasochistic acts with him. Zabuski's wife has said she believes
her husband is only guilty of infidelity.</TE>
<TE>   Suehiro said the case showed that women should not trust the men
they meet over the Internet. She said the victims did not use common
sense.</TE>

<HD>Renewable-Energy Bill Passed by Assembly</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Lawmakers also approve a measure to allow
workers to take paid time off in case of illness or childbirth.</DH>

<LD>California's appetite for wind, solar and geothermal electricity
would gradually expand over the next 15 years under a bill passed by
the Assembly on Tuesday and probably headed for the law books.</LD>
<LD>   The Assembly also approved sweeping legislation that would give
millions of workers the right to take paid time off from work to care
for sick parents or bond with new children.</LD>
<LD>   It also passed a measure requiring executives to report potential
fraud within their firm or face penalties, one of a series of
corporate accountability measures inspired by recent debacles.</LD>
<TE>   And the Senate approved a measure to protect the estimated 9
million Californians who are members of homeowner associations from
foreclosures, as lawmakers continued debating bills before the end of
the legislative session Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The energy bill, by Sen. Byron Sher (D-Stanford), requires
utilities to increase the share of electricity they sell that comes
from renewable sources to at least 20% by 2017. Consumer advocates
say such a standard would help buffer the state from natural gas
price spikes and restore its reputation as a clean energy leader.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California Edison gets 15% of its electricity from
renewable sources, and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric's portfolio of power
supplies is 12% renewable. Both utilities support the measure, SB
1078. San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, which gets 1% of its power from
renewable sources, first opposed the bill then took a neutral stance.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation was scheduled to return to the Senate for final
approval. But the Assembly late Tuesday night voted to keep it on the
floor, where it may be amended before it moves on. Gov. Gray Davis
strongly endorses it, said spokesman Steven Maviglio.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition from utilities had hung up the bill in the Assembly's
energy committee. It finally cleared the committee a week ago with an
amendment that requires a 1%-a-year increase in renewable energy
production.</TE>
<TE>   The 49-13 vote in the Assembly came after some Republicans argued
that the bill would boost electricity prices. Assemblyman Bill
Leonard (R-San Bernardino) called it welfare for wind-farm and
solar-panel owners.</TE>
<TE>   "How can you ever have price stability when you have mandated that
20% of your product must come from specific suppliers?" Leonard
asked. "For renewables to work, it should be the choice of me and you
and other consumers."</TE>
<TE>   The bill's 20% renewable requirement would not apply to publicly
owned utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power, which would be directed instead to set and meet their own
standard.</TE>
<TE>   The 20% standard would apply, however, to new contracts between
private energy companies and electricity consumers.</TE>
<TE>   The paid-leave measure, by Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica),
would create a new mandatory state insurance program in which workers
would have to pay a fee of less than 1% from their paychecks every
month so they could take paid time off during family emergencies. If
a worker took time off because a spouse or parent fell ill, or
because the family was bringing a new child into the home, the
employee would receive as much as 55% of his or her salary from the
state-run fund for up to six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats strongly supported the legislation, SB 1661, noting that
Kuehl had made changes that no longer would require employers to
share the cost with workers.</TE>
<TE>   "I am amazed by people who claim that the most important
institution in America is the family, but then don't want to do
anything to support family," said Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg
(D-Los Angeles), chiding her GOP colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans argued just as vehemently that the bill would hurt
business and take money out of workers' pockets for a program they
might not want.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tax on workers so that someday some of them will be
able to take some time off," said Assemblyman George Runner
(R-Lancaster). "We've decided that everyone cannot be responsible,
and we need to take the money from them so they can take care of
themselves."</TE>
<TE>   The bill passed the Assembly on a 45-28 vote. It now awaits final
action in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   The whistle-blower bill, SB 783 by Sen. Martha Escutia
(D-Whittier), would make officers or directors of a corporation
liable for civil penalties of up to $100,000 if they fail to notify
the attorney general or some other government agency of fraudulent
activity within their firm. The measure provides other employees with
a whistle-blower hotline run by the attorney general, and protects
those workers from retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   Some Republicans and Democrats opposed the measure, arguing that
though it means well, its descriptions of improper corporate activity
are vague and would open the door for unhappy workers to wreak havoc.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a measure that would send the message once again that
California is a hostile place to do business," said Assemblywoman
Charlene Zettel (R-Poway).</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the bill passed 43 to 20. It now goes to the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   The homeowner association bill, AB 2289 by Assemblywoman Christine
Kehoe (D-San Diego), seeks to protect residents from hasty
foreclosures brought on by a failure to pay monthly dues.</TE>
<TE>   It would require homeowner associations to warn members that
failure to pay the dues could result in foreclosure, and to send
warning letters 30 days before filing a lien.</TE>
<TE>   The bill's sponsor, the Congress of California Seniors, argues
that many homeowners associations are too quick to initiate
foreclosure proceedings on residents, and that the foreclosures take
place without court action according to written association
agreements few homeowners carefully scrutinize.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, mainly homeowner associations, argue that the 30-day
warning would put them at a disadvantage, because other creditors do
not face such rules when trying to recoup payments.</TE>
<TE>   The measure passed the Senate on a 31-2 vote. It goes to the
Assembly for final consideration.</TE>

<HD>A Stronger Simon Could Have Helped Farmers</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a good chance that mushroom on your pizza came from a farm in
Oxnard, and I don't mean to alarm you, but I might have touched it.</LD>
<LD>   Curiosity got the best of me, but I only fingered a few nubs while
touring the Pictsweet Mushroom Farm. I went up there because the
mushroom finds itself at the epicenter of California politics these
days.</LD>
<LD>   Barbra Streisand, Warren Beatty, Martin Sheen--the usual
suspects--stand in unison behind the rights of California farm
workers and a bill that would give them greater bargaining power with
employers. The bill has cleared the Legislature and now sits before
Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<TE>   It's classic Gray's Anatomy.</TE>
<TE>   On one hand, he's got a relatively pro-labor record, and happens
to be the guy who officially designated the state holiday for Cesar
Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, he has an undiagnosed compulsive fund-raising
disorder, and growers just forked over $100,000 to his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Unsurprisingly, insiders say Davis is leaning toward growers and a
veto of the bill. Or, as a Davis flack explained it to me, "He's
going to do what's best for the economy."</TE>
<TE>   Yes. And George Bush is going to do what's best for the
environment.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, I met with a Pictsweet employee named Alfredo Zamora at
a downtown Oxnard cafe. Zamora, 43, works between seven and 12 hours
a day, six days a week. This was his day off.</TE>
<TE>   Zamora and 20-plus colleagues grub away in dank, primitive growing
rooms that smell faintly of barnyard manure, giving them a great deal
in common with the state Legislature. He wears a miner's flashlight
helmet and climbs mushroom bunk beds to pick the vegetable, secured
against falls with a ceiling cable attached to a belt harness.</TE>
<TE>   For each 3-pound basket of mushrooms Zamora picks, he gets 48
cents. In 14 years, he said, his annual pay has gone from roughly
$18,000 to $22,000, which means he's losing ground in real dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't like it," Zamora quotes his boss as saying, "there's
the door. And the door is wide."</TE>
<TE>   Pictsweet workers are represented by the UFW, but the union hasn't
been able to negotiate a contract with Pictsweet the entire time
Zamora's been there. Dozens of farm worker groups are in the same
boat across the state, and the bill on the governor's desk would send
such disputes to an arbitrator.</TE>
<TE>   Growers cry that the UFW doesn't bargain in good faith, and they
claim many farms will go under if forced to make concessions.</TE>
<TE>   This whole mess can actually be blamed on Bill "Simple" Simon.</TE>
<TE>   If the Republican candidate for governor weren't such a brick,
farmers would have hopped aboard his wagon, and Davis would have
signed this bill by now.</TE>
<TE>   The poor, put-upon ag industry loves to bankroll pols who wave the
flag for smaller government, even as farmers scam public subsidies
like champs. But with Simon showing no detectable pulse, the aggies
threw money in the direction of Davis, who fetches like a wirehair
terrier. He's up to $1.5 million, and still sniffing.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know what pizza toppings the governor likes, but ordering
a pie with him could get very complicated. Did the olive lobby write
him a bigger check? Or was it the bell pepper cooperative?</TE>
<TE>   Back to Pictsweet. There is another side to the story, and I found
it when I drove out to the farm. "If it's so horrible here," a plant
official asked me, "why have some of these guys stayed 20 and 30
years?"</TE>
<TE>   Because in relative terms, it's a pretty good deal. Unlike
itinerant pickers who slave away in the fields, this is a year-round
operation, with limited medical benefits and three weeks of paid
vacation after two years, plus bonuses. The plant official claimed
some salaries top $30,000.</TE>
<TE>   A union mushroom farm in Monterey offers a slightly better
package, and employees can more easily air grievances. But at
Pictsweet, I saw employees wearing "No to UFW" T-shirts. The union
calls them company stooges, but many Pictsweet employees have tried
to dump the UFW, claiming it hasn't done a thing for them.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not willing to pay another tax/fee of any kind to the
union," one employee wrote me in a four-page screed.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure how Pictsweet workers became Exhibit A in the
argument for the arbitration bill. But it seems to me a much better
case can be made for the hundreds of people I saw bent over the
fields of the Oxnard Plain as I drove away.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those workers have union representation but no contract,
just like Pictsweet employees. But they make half the salary and have
none of the benefits.</TE>
<TE>   That's $10,000 a year or so. Certainly not enough to take up a
collection and match the campaign contribution made by their ag
bosses.</TE>
<TE>   I had a cup of coffee recently with Peter Camejo, the Green Party
candidate for governor, and he had a thought.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know how to get Gray Davis to change his position on an
issue?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   No, how?</TE>
<TE>   "Tell him the check bounced."</TE>

<HD>J. David Love, 89; Renowned Geologist, Environmentalist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LANDER, Wyo.</DL>
<LD>Reared on a hardscrabble Wyoming ranch where once he ate rattlesnake
meat with a fugitive gunslinger, J. David Love rose from the plains
to become a leading Rocky Mountain field geologist as well as a noted
environmentalist who campaigned for the preservation of Wyoming's
delicate Red Desert.</LD>
<LD>   Love, 89, who died Friday in Casper, Wyo., after suffering a
debilitating stroke in June, mapped and surveyed much of this remote,
mountainous territory rich in mineral resources. In an era of
satellite imagery and computer analysis, Love was one of the last
great field researchers in a profession that has been largely given
over to laboratory geoscientists.</LD>
<LD>   "We are never going to see a field geologist like Dave again. They
just don't train them like that," former Wyoming legislator and
Love's friend Tom Stroock told the Casper Star-Tribune. "Dave's
specialty was out in the field, walking the fault lines, walking the
escarpments and touching the rocks."</LD>
<TE>   Although Love was among the first to discover large deposits of
uranium in Wyoming in the 1940s, he declined lucrative offers from
private companies to help them exploit it, preferring the
independence of his work as a teacher at the University of Wyoming
and longtime director of the Wyoming State Geological Survey.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, Love was instrumental in unearthing supplies
of strategic minerals, including vanadium, which was used for armor
plates on ships, tanks and aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The powerfully built geologist was renowned for his endurance
during long research treks into the rugged Absaroka Range east of
Yellowstone National Park that he continued well into his 80s.</TE>
<TE>   "He could look at the way trees were growing and from watching the
habits of animals and tell you what happened there geologically
hundreds and even thousands of years before," said Jackson Hole
investor Tom Chrystie, who accompanied Love to the Absarokas three
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Jane, Love's wife of 62 years, said the family planned to scatter
his ashes in the Absaroka Range he loved. "But it's going to take
horses to get in there where he wanted them," she said Tuesday. In
addition to his wife, Love is survived by four children and seven
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, David and Jane Love donated an acre of land they owned in
a prime area of Jackson, the extremely expensive Wyoming mountain
resort town, to build 15 units of affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   It was an act reflective of Love's lifelong social consciousness.
Love was one of the earliest geologists to worry about the
relationship of mining to environmental and human health.</TE>
<TE>   When the Geological Society of America presented him with its
first Legendary Geoscientist Award in 1999, Love told the audience:
"I don't think we could make a better contribution to geology and
human health than to tie them together."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Riverton in 1913, Love joked that he got into geology
because as a child "there wasn't anything else to see where I was,
except the rear end of a cow 15 hours a day."</TE>
<TE>   The courtship and marriage of Love's Scottish rancher father and
Wellesley educated schoolteacher mother was detailed in the 1986 book
"Rising From the Plains" by John McPhee. The family used pages of the
New York Times to insulate the walls of their Muskrat Basin homestead
in the Wind River Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Love and his brother were taught at home by their mother--who
instructed them in classical Greek and Latin as well as French--until
high school.</TE>
<TE>   When she was not teaching her two boys, Ethel Phoebe Waxham Love
warded off attacks by roving bands of wild dogs.</TE>
<TE>   After earning his bachelor's and master's degrees from the
University of Wyoming, Love attended Yale University, where he earned
his doctorate in 1938.</TE>
<TE>   The author of more than 250 geological publications, including two
geological maps of Wyoming, Love trained 25 other geologists in his
style of field research.</TE>
<TE>   In "Rising From the Plains," McPhee described Love as the "grand
old man of Rocky Mountain geology."</TE>
<TE>   His research led to exploitation of mineral resources in his home
state.</TE>
<TE>   But his activism on preserving the wilderness made him a hero to
environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Love supported a plan--fiercely opposed by the oil and
gas industry--by former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt to manage
drilling in the Red Desert.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a contradiction of sorts," said friend Tom Bell, founder
of High Country News, who said Love was the first contributor to his
environmental publication.</TE>
<TE>   "He saw what was happening to the open range but he also felt the
economic needs of the state."</TE>
<TE>   In that respect, few men have more personified the beauty and the
bounty of Wyoming and the mountain West.</TE>
<TE>   "He carries within himself some of the central paradoxes of his
time," wrote McPhee.</TE>
<TE>   "Among environmentalists he seems to me a good deal less lopsided
than many, although beset by contradictory interests, like the
society he serves."</TE>
<TE>   McPhee, who visited Love in the Casper hospital in the days before
his death, recalled a trip he took with Love in the Wind River Range,
near South Pass, where the two men saw a large open-pit iron mine.</TE>
<TE>   The mine, since closed, employed several hundred people from the
nearby town of Lander. McPhee asked Love what he felt about the mine.</TE>
<TE>   "They've only ruined one side of the mountain," Love said.</TE>
<TE>   "Behind the pit, the range top is covered with snow. I can live
with this. This is part of the lifeblood of our nation."</TE>

<HD>We'd Go It Alone, Rumsfeld Tells Marines</HD>
<DH>Defense: Secretary tells a Camp Pendleton audience he
believes others will follow if U.S. engages Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAMP PENDLETON</DL>
<LD>Speaking to those who might do the fighting, Defense Secretary Donald
H. Rumsfeld said Tuesday that President Bush will not be dissuaded by
a lack of international allies if he decides to use military force to
topple Iraq's Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   Rumsfeld told several thousand Marines that he is confident other
nations will follow if the United States shows leadership in moving
to rid the region of a dangerous despot who is amassing weapons of
mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   "It is less important to be unanimous than it is to be making the
right decision and doing the right thing, even though at the outset
it may seem lonely," Rumsfeld said.</LD>
<TE>   The go-it-alone message found instant favor among the Marines,
many of whom have served in Afghanistan and are training for
conditions similar to those in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "Having a coalition is good, but we need to be self-sufficient to
defend our freedom and safety," said Cpl. Robert Robinson. "If they
want us, the Marines are ready, like always."</TE>
<TE>   "The Marines are strong enough to do what needs to be done," said
Pvt. Ryan Strandberg.</TE>
<TE>   There are now 2000 Marines and sailors from Camp Pendleton and San
Diego aboard ships in the Persian Gulf region, ready for an
amphibious assault.</TE>
<TE>   Marines from here were the first conventional combat troops in
Afghanistan, seizing a Taliban military camp in late November and
helping seal the Afghan opposition fighters' victory at Kandahar,
once a Taliban stronghold.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld's message was clear. Marines from Camp Pendleton played a
decisive role in Afghanistan and may be called upon again soon.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld spoke from a podium flanked by four light-armored
vehicles used by Marine "hunter-killer" teams in Afghanistan to
corral or kill fleeing Taliban and Al Qaeda forces to keep them from
regrouping for a counterattack. "Thank you for all you do for our
country, our freedom and for all the world," Rumsfeld said to cheers.</TE>
<TE>   As the Marines waited for Rumsfeld's arrival, Maj. Gen. James
Mattis, who commanded Marines in Afghanistan, told his troops to help
convince Rumsfeld that "we're looking forward to the [Iraqi] brawl if
you and the president want to send us."</TE>
<TE>   Asked by several Marines whether the U.S. would act even if it
could not gather a coalition Rumsfeld repeated variations on an
answer: "Leadership in the right direction finds followers."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), who attended the Camp Pendleton
speech, said he agreed with Rumsfeld. "It's predictable when America
leads," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Tuesday, Rumsfeld provided a similar round of thanks to
several hundred sailors aboard the amphibious assault ship Bonhomme
Richard, docked at the 32nd Street Naval Station in San Diego. He
recalled that his father, who served in the Navy during World War II,
had received a congratulatory letter from then-Navy Secretary James
Forrestal, telling him he should be proud of his service.</TE>
<TE>   "You, too, deserve to be proud of your service as long as you
live," Rumsfeld told the sailors massed in the hangar bay of the
ship, which returned in mid-June after a six-month deployment in the
north Arabian Sea.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by a sailor if he anticipated large numbers of Iraqi POWs,

<HD>UC Merced Judged Safe for Species</HD>
<DH>School: Construction will not jeopardize environment,
according to a federal review.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a boost for the proposed UC Merced campus, federal officials
released on Tuesday an opinion that construction of the school would
be unlikely to jeopardize the 13 endangered plant and animal species
on the 910-acre site.</LD>
<LD>   The opinion was prepared by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and
released by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.</LD>
<LD>   The main section of the long-stalled 10th UC campus, which would
cover 710 acres, faces further environmental reviews, expected to
take about three years. As part of the process, federal authorities
will again investigate the potential effects on endangered species.</LD>
<TE>   University officials hope to begin the first phase of construction
on a neighboring 200-acre former golf course site this fall.</TE>
<TE>   That initial construction plan, however, hinges on the outcome of
a court hearing set for Oct. 1 in Merced County Superior Court
concerning a legal challenge that was brought by environmental
groups.</TE>
<TE>   The planned university site, northeast of Merced, is in an area of
sensitive wetlands and prime grazing and agricultural lands. Among
the endangered species on the site are two varieties of fairy shrimp,
the bald eagle and the San Joaquin kit fox.</TE>

<HD>Attorneys Gathered in Las Vegas Show Off Their
Money-Grabbing Skills</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As you know, nothing gets the attention of attorneys like money.
Hence the bizarre exhibit at a weekend lawyers' convention in Las
Vegas where attendees were given the chance to keep all the
wind-blown dollar bills they could chase down inside a glass booth in
30 seconds.</LD>
<LD>   At the controls of the wind-machine was Brian Sokol of LitFunding
Corp., who was looking for a way to strike up a conversation with
members of the L.A. Consumer Attorneys Assn. LitFunding lends money
to attorneys and plaintiffs in personal injury cases.</LD>
<LD>   Sokol told one passerby that the record for the top money-chaser
at the Venetian Hotel that weekend was $63 in half a minute. (That
works out to $7,560 an hour, which most attorneys would concede is a
satisfactory rate.) Of course, LitFunding, conscious of who it was
dealing with, wasn't about to let an attorney get socked in the eye
by a George Washington. All money-grabbers had to put safety goggles
on first.</LD>
<TE>   But what about the slip-and-fall possibilities?</TE>
<TE>   More lawyer precautions: At another convention booth, the
California Health Institute, a Woodland Hills-based chiropractic
group, offered attorneys free massages--if they first signed
liability releases. Lawsuits can be such a pain in the neck.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers' alias: The L.A. Consumer Attorneys, by the way, didn't
start out with that name. It was the L.A. Trial Lawyers Assn. until
the O.J. Simpson trial came along. The group, which handles civil
cases, complained it was "too often confused with criminal trial
lawyers," like the not-universally-loved members of the Simpson team.</TE>
<TE>   I'm proud to say that this column staged a contest back then to
come up with a new name. But the barristers rejected the winning
entry: Earnest Attorneys Trying in Los Angeles (EATLA, for short).</TE>
<TE>   Must be a wrist injury: Roger Marshutz came upon a new malady,
named for an insurance program, that can be treated with acupuncture
(see accompanying). "Maybe after filling out all the workers' comp
forms, you need the treatment," he surmised.</TE>
<TE>   Still on the legal beat: Tom O'Leary of Covina took note of the
firm that sponsored one courtroom drama (see photo) and said, "I
think Jiffy Lube is going to sponsor 'Grease' next."</TE>
<TE>   Gnarly county: Brian Monahan of Venice noticed a sign that seemed
to have been altered to give a surf report (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   We can all sleep better now: The police log of the Los Alamitos
News-Enterprise assured readers that "a man in a sleeping bag on the
roof [of a business] was an employee watching for burglars."</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: Just the thing for that kid that has trouble waking up
for school? Dennis Levin of Larchmont Village saw an ad for a
radio/alarm clock that can be played in the shower.</TE>

<HD>Fund-Raiser Has Been Attacked Over Amount Charities Gained</HD>
<DH>Philanthropy: Some say Pallotta TeamWorks, which brought in
$200 million in 10 years, kept too much of the money. Others blame
economic weakness for its closing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the close of this year's California AIDS Ride in June, the
symbolism couldn't have been more obvious--a harbinger of what was to
come for Pallotta TeamWorks, the event producer.</LD>
<LD>   A year earlier, more than 2,000 cyclists had attended an elaborate
closing ceremony at the Los Angeles Coliseum. This year, 715 riders
pedaled across the finish line at Santa Monica City College.</LD>
<LD>   Last weekend, Pallotta TeamWorks, which had raised more than $200
million for charity in its 10-year history, announced that it had
laid off 250 employees and closed.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, many who had profited from or participated in Pallotta
events wondered whether this was an end or just a setback for Dan
Pallotta, who introduced new models for fund-raisers while coming
under fire for being more businessman than philanthropist.</TE>
<TE>   "There's something about Pallotta and the empire he built that is
a bit of a Greek tragedy," said Mark Cloutier, a San Francisco AIDS
activist who sued Pallotta in April, alleging that Pallotta had
delivered less than one-third of the $28 million his company received
from its 2000 and 2001 Vaccine Rides to charity. That suit is
pending.</TE>
<TE>   Pallotta TeamWorks, a commercial organization, was scheduled to
produce 24 events this year in the United States and overseas,
supporting such causes as breast cancer and suicide prevention.</TE>
<TE>   But many of them were plagued with difficulties, in large part
because of questions about how much of the money raised by
participants had actually gone to charity and about the validity of
the production fees charged by Pallotta TeamWorks, which recently
hovered in the mid-$200,000 range.</TE>
<TE>   On the first AIDS Ride in 1994, 478 people rode 565 miles, from
San Francisco to Los Angeles, and raised $1.4 million. Seventy-three
percent of that money went to charity, according to the Pallotta Web
site. But in 1998, a group of Florida AIDS charities dropped Pallotta
TeamWorks after only 11.83% of the $1.133 million raised went to
charity.</TE>
<TE>   In October, the two charities that had benefited from the
California AIDS Ride--the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center and the
San Francisco AIDS Foundation--broke ties with Pallotta TeamWorks,
saying that unexpected cost overruns had cut into proceeds from the
ride.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, sponsors of the Washington AIDS Ride in June,
disappointed by the money raised this year, announced that they too
would sever ties with Pallotta TeamWorks.</TE>
<TE>   Pallotta, who did not return calls seeking comment, has insisted
that he is an easy target.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never been about the money for me, but it's never not been
about the money," he told the San Francisco Chronicle this year.
"When an organization like ours is profitable, we can invest those
profits back in the business, which is what we've done."</TE>
<TE>   Some organizations, including the Walker-Whitman Clinic and Food
and Friends, both beneficiaries of the Washington ride, said that
putting all the blame on Pallotta is unfair.</TE>
<TE>   They cited a poor economic environment for charitable giving and
bad publicity about Pallotta's overhead costs.</TE>
<TE>   Pallotta TeamWorks helped the two Washington groups raise $14
million in seven years, said Craig Shniderman, executive director of
Food and Friends. "That alone is nothing to sneeze at..... I'm not
going to be dancing on their grave."</TE>
<TE>   Avon announced that this would be its last year in partnership
with Pallotta on the Avon Foundation's Breast Cancer Crusade, which
is scheduled to take place in October.</TE>
<TE>   Avon said that it fully expects the crusades, which are three-day
walks, to proceed as planned in Los Angeles, Atlanta and New York.
But some people complained that they couldn't get straight answers on
whether the walk would take place.</TE>
<TE>   Among those was Stacey McClennen, who planned to take part in the
California walk. "I'm a team captain," she said. "We're 12 women, and
we're all flying in from other places, even Canada, and we have
already bought our tickets. At this point, we are coming anyway and
walking on our own if we have to."</TE>

<HD>A Courageous 'Little Tiger' Leaves Office Without Regrets</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Lam is sitting in his office above a nephew's tofu store in
Little Saigon, pondering a question about the worst moment in his
10-year political career as a Westminster city councilman. It was a
"moment" that stretched out over several months in early 1999 and
came to define Lam as a man of personal and political courage.</LD>
<LD>   Not that much good came of it. What he mostly got, he says, was a
ton of legal bills and quadruple-bypass surgery.</LD>
<LD>   This year, at 65, the man once dubbed the "Little Tiger" by a U.S.
Embassy official in Saigon is retiring.</LD>
<TE>   The question put to him in his office, then, seems relevant: Would
he do it the same way again?</TE>
<TE>   Lam has spent lots of time since 1999 thinking about that. The
incident flared overnight: A video store owner in Little Saigon
displayed a poster of Ho Chi Minh and the flag of communist Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   To Westminster's anti-communist Vietnamese community, the display
was treasonous. Thousands of protesters hit the streets to say so.
They wanted Lam, the first Vietnamese American elected to office in
America, to join them. He refused, saying the city attorney had
advised against him taking a stand, because the beleaguered store
owner might someday sue the city for failing to protect him and his
store.</TE>
<TE>   It would have been a snap for Lam to discount the advice. After
all, he sympathized with the anti-communist protesters. From
childhood to manhood, he had suffered the same upheavals and
tragedies that hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese did as they
watched the French, the communists and the Americans turn their
country upside down and rend it in half.</TE>
<TE>   He first became a refugee at 10 during the French bombardment of
Vietnam in 1946 and later when the communists took over. The
communists took his family's property, Lam says, and he helped run a
U.S.-backed refugee camp on Guam after the fall of Saigon in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   "I left behind the bones of my ancestors," he says of Vietnam. "I
left behind my good living standards, all my assets, came here empty-
handed and rebuilt my life."</TE>
<TE>   So, yes, Lam could easily have spoken out. But he didn't, saying
then and now he had to put the city's interests above those of the
Vietnamese community. By keeping his distance, he withheld what could
have been seen as an official stamp of approval for the crowd's
effort to suppress an unpopular viewpoint. He refused to join what
became, at times, an angry mob.</TE>
<TE>   He paid a price in vituperative remarks against him and a
protracted boycott of his restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Would he do it again?</TE>
<TE>   In a word, yes. But that doesn't mean all is forgiven or forgotten
with him.</TE>
<TE>   "It still is a sore point in my life," he says. "Whenever you talk
about that time, it is still haunting me and my family. But when I
take a stand, I can't do anything halfway. If tonight you want me to
go to Big Bear and chop down the highest branch of a pine tree, if I
considered it a challenge, I would take the challenge."</TE>
<TE>   The magnitude of Lam's courage went largely unnoticed in the
press. It wasn't as though he became a media darling to help salve
the personal trauma. Whatever encouragement he got was fleeting;
whatever denunciation he got was lasting.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that Lam is leaving office a bitter man. While chatting
this week in his office, he seems upbeat.</TE>
<TE>   We talk about political courage, and I suggest it fit Anaheim
mayoral candidate Curt Pringle's recent public support of a
Mexican-based supermarket in Anaheim. The store's presence angered
many potential Pringle voters, and I can't imagine that Pringle, once
persona non grata in Orange County's Latino community, really thinks
his stance will result in Latino voters stampeding to his candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   For my money, it was a principled stand on Pringle's part, even if
some political calculation figured in.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, let's talk about Curt Pringle," Lam jokes.</TE>
<TE>   Not today.</TE>
<TE>   Today, we're talking about the Little Tiger at the end of his
political trail.</TE>
<TE>   And if history is fair, it'll record his most trying moment in
public life as his most shining.</TE>

<LD>James N. Kitchens, 78, a bartender to the stars for 47 years at the
Beverly Hills, Bel-Air and Beverly Hilton hotels, died of heart
failure Saturday at Sherman Oaks Hospital.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Arkansas who served in the Navy during World War II,
Kitchens hitchhiked to Los Angeles in 1947 and got a job as bar boy
at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where he remained for 25 years.</LD>
<LD>   By 1961, he had become bar manager for the Crystal Room and the
Polo Lounge.</LD>
<TE>   In 1972, Kitchens transferred to the more secluded Hotel Bel-Air,
becoming bar manager two years later. Along with his assistant, Jose
Martin del Campo, he became known for serving a drink he called the
Bel-Air Royale--a flute of champagne with a splash of peach schnapps
and a slice of fresh peach.</TE>
<TE>   After 15 years at the Bel-Air, Kitchens concluded his long career
behind the bar of the larger Beverly Hilton Hotel from 1988 until his
retirement in 1995.</TE>

<HD>Rape Victims Decry Backlog of DNA Tests and Demand Timely
Analysis</HD>
<DH>Activism: Dozens gather near police headquarters in
downtown L.A. to urge law enforcement agencies to devote more
resources to crime labs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rape survivors rallying at the Los Angeles Police Department
headquarters Tuesday called on law enforcement agencies to devote
more money to analyzing biological material for DNA and decried the
increasing backlog of untested rape kits in police evidence rooms.</LD>
<LD>   "My rape kit sat on the shelf gathering dust for four years"
before it was tested, said Karen Pomer, whose rapist was caught after
he assaulted other women in the mid-1990s.</LD>
<LD>   About 35 protesters organized by the Rainbow Sisters Project
gathered in front of Parker Center downtown to march to the federal
building a block away and then to the Kenneth Hahn Hall of
Administration on Temple Street.</LD>
<TE>   With scientific advances and computer databases of thousands of
DNA profiles, biological evidence has become a powerful tool to help
law enforcement catch sexual offenders and to exonerate wrongly
convicted prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   But because of a shortage in resources, criminalists for the LAPD
and the Sheriff's Department have given priority for years to
analyzing biological evidence in cases in which suspects have been
identified and are headed for trial. A huge backlog of DNA requests
from investigators has been accumulating.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say this evidence should be analyzed as quickly as
possible so that it can be compared with DNA profiles in the database
of inmates who have been convicted of sexual offenses and other
crimes.</TE>
<TE>   For the last year, debate has swirled around the amount of space
that will be devoted to DNA analysis in the county's planned
$96-million crime lab, which is scheduled to be completed in 2005.
Critics have charged that the LAPD is not devoting enough space or
criminalists to DNA testing.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Commission announced two weeks ago that it
will review plans for the lab. Interim Police Chief Martin Pomeroy
said the department's plans are adequate for the number of
criminalists that the City Council will fund.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy heated up last month when the LAPD disclosed that
its detectives had mistakenly authorized the destruction of
biological evidence in about 1,000 cases.</TE>
<TE>   The police and the Sheriff's Department have called a moratorium
on destruction of DNA evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Protesters carried signs Tuesday denouncing the Police Department
for the destruction of the rape kits and urging the department to
preserve DNA evidence forever.</TE>
<TE>   Debbie Smith, a Williamsburg, Va., rape victim who has been
lobbying Congress for increased funding for DNA testing, said
hundreds of thousands of rape kits across the country have gone
untested. "They're sitting on shelves behind closed doors,
backlogged."</TE>
<TE>   "If not for DNA, my rapist would still be out there," she said.
"It took 6 1/2 years to find him because the DNA was untested and sat
on a shelf."</TE>
<TE>   Pomer, a founder of Rainbow Sisters, which lobbies for legislation
and educates the public on behalf of rape survivors, said DNA
evidence should never be destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   She also urged the department to increase the DNA crime lab staff
to 40 criminalists, from its current plans for 25.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Pomer said the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors should insist that the Sheriff's Department determine
whether any biological evidence in its custody has been destroyed and
require the agency to provide the board with a full accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials have said its moratorium on destruction of DNA
evidence has been in effect since November 1991. They have also said
they are examining the files in a sampling of sex offense cases to
determine whether rape kits have been mistakenly destroyed. Police
officials have said they recognize the power of DNA, and are
reviewing departmental practices in deciding when to dispose of
biological evidence.</TE>

<HD>Retrial of 5th Defendant in Fatal Beating Begins</HD>
<DH>Court: Ventura gang member allegedly took part in attack on
a man who mob thought had called police to a loud party. Four others
are serving life terms.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura gang member returned to court Tuesday to begin his second
trial on murder charges for allegedly kicking and punching a wounded
18-year-old man as he tried to crawl away from a deadly gang attack.</LD>
<LD>   Ramiro Salgado, 22, sat expressionless as a Ventura County
prosecutor described him as a participant in the September 1999
beating of William Zara, a Ventura Theater stagehand who was attacked
outside his apartment by gang members who suspected him and his
friends of reporting their loud party to police.</LD>
<LD>   "The officers, within minutes of leaving, come back to find Mr.
Zara lying in a puddle of blood," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Maeve Fox
in her opening statement.</LD>
<TE>   In the six minutes after the patrol officers left the west Ventura
neighborhood where the party was held, Fox said, about a dozen gang
members swarmed outside Zara's apartment and fatally beat him with a
bat, a shovel, their fists and feet.</TE>
<TE>   By his own admission, Salgado participated in the killing by
kicking and striking Zara as he crawled on hands and knees to escape
the attack, the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   But defense lawyer Richard Loftus told jurors in his opening
statement that the only evidence tying his client to the crime is a
false confession Salgado gave police during an exhaustive
interrogation.</TE>
<TE>   There is no scientific evidence, Loftus argued, and no witnesses
who identified Salgado as one of the attackers.</TE>
<TE>   "None of them will tell you Mr. Salgado was there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Salgado is the fifth and final defendant to stand trial in Zara's
killing.</TE>
<TE>   Benny Lopez, Frank Olvera, Terry Schell and Rosana Olvera were
convicted of murder last year and are serving life sentences. All
were arrested in the weeks after the Sept. 25, 1999, attack.</TE>
<TE>   Salgado, a west Ventura gang member since 1996, was arrested in
August 2000 after being identified by a fellow gang member and
admitting to police that he participated in the assault.</TE>
<TE>   Three months ago, Salgado's first murder trial in Ventura County
Superior Court ended in a mistrial after jurors deadlocked amid a
disagreement over the alleged confession.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors told lawyers afterward that they questioned whether Salgado
participated in the attack or simply told authorities what he thought
they wanted to hear.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks after the mistrial, Ventura County prosecutors
announced they would retry the case.</TE>
<TE>   Salgado's tape-recorded statements in the police interview room
are again likely to be the centerpiece of his retrial, which is
expected to last about a month.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura Police Det. Richard Payne, a gang expert, was the first
witness to testify Tuesday. Payne tracks the activities of the west
Ventura gang involved in the Zara beating.</TE>
<TE>   Payne testified that Salgado was a known gang member, whose
association has been documented by police since 1996. He said records
show Salgado has been stopped by police about two dozen times since
then with other gang members.</TE>
<TE>   One month before the slaying, Payne testified, Salgado was served
with a court injunction barring him from attending the Ventura County
Fair at the county fairgrounds, which his gang considers part of its
turf.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony in the case is scheduled to resume today.</TE>

<HD>2002 SAT Scores Higher in Math, Lower in Verbal</HD>
<DH>Education: Schools are urged to stress reading and writing.
Female students gain slightly in closing the gap with their male
counterparts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The high school graduating class of 2002 scored slightly higher in
math but lower in verbal skills than last year's class on the SAT
college entrance exam, the College Board reported Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   College Board President Gaston Caperton applauded students for
their improved math performance, noting that the average score rose
two points this year to 516--its highest level since 1969. He
attributed the gain to students taking more rigorous math courses.</LD>
<LD>   But scores on the verbal part of the high-stakes test taken by 1.3
million high school students have stalled in recent years, and dipped
two points this year to 504. Caperton urged U.S. high schools,
parents and students to place renewed emphasis on reading,
composition and grammar.</LD>
<TE>   "As a nation, we need to focus on helping students improve their
reading and writing skills," he said at a Washington news conference.</TE>
<TE>   The College Board, which owns the SAT, announced in June that it
will add a writing test to the exam beginning in March 2005. The move
was propelled in part by the University of California, the SAT's
biggest client, which had threatened to scrap the test in favor of
developing one of its own.</TE>
<TE>   The SAT's testing rival, the ACT, announced this week that it also
will offer an essay on its exam starting in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Students don't read as much or as deeply in high school as they
used to, several educators said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have now is a population that is very responsive to
imagery, but losing its capacity to use and respond to words," said
Carol Muske-Dukes, a USC English professor who directs the
university's graduate writing program. "When you lose the capacity to
read deeply, you lose the capacity to think."</TE>
<TE>   In other trends, female students this year narrowed the gap
between their overall scores and those of male students, but only
slightly. Males outscored females by 39 points on the combined verbal
and math portions of the SAT, down from 42 points last year. Math
scores accounted for most of the difference, as in previous years.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said the persistent gap should raise questions about the
fairness of the test, which is used by the majority of the nation's
top colleges and universities as a criterion for admission.</TE>
<TE>   "It just galls me that a test that purports to predict how
students will perform in college continues to show that women do
worse even though they do so much better in college," said Paul
Kanarek, who heads the Orange County office of the Princeton Review,
which prepares students for the SAT.</TE>
<TE>   Female students, he and others noted, get better grades than men
in high school and college and should thus outperform them on the SAT
and other exams.</TE>
<TE>   College Board researchers say, though, that the gap may be because
a greater proportion and range of female students take the test.
Women account for about 54% of test-takers.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, men averaged 507 points for the verbal section this
year while women scored 502. In math, male students scored an average
of 534 points and women scored 500--the highest average for female
students in 35 years.</TE>
<TE>   Still larger gaps existed between the scores of white students and
most minority groups, as they have in the past. Ethnic minorities
made up 35% of the students who took the test this year, the largest
proportion in history, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Black students nationwide scored an average of 203 points lower
than non-Latino whites on the combined math and verbal SAT, worse
than last year's 201. Mexican Americans scored an average of 157
points below non-Latino whites, versus 151 points in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   As in previous years, Asian Americans outperformed all other
groups on the math section of the SAT.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the percentage of college-bound students taking the
test rose to a record 52% this year, compared with 46% of students
nationwide. Participation among minority students in California also
increased this year, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, California students scored 496 on the verbal section,
eight points below the national average, and 517 on the math, a point
above the national average.</TE>
<TE>   The SAT report follows by one week the results released for the
ACT, which showed that the national average composite score fell
slightly this year, the first decline in five years.</TE>

<KH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</KH>
<HD>Simon Again Says Davis Donation Bought License to Pollute</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr. on Tuesday renewed
his charge that Gov. Gray Davis is selling state policy for campaign
donations, returning to a theme that is the focus of his first
television commercial in several weeks.</LD>
<LD>   During a campaign stop in San Francisco, Simon said there is a
connection between a $70,500 contribution to Davis from the Tosco oil
refinery and the subsequent decision of a regional water quality
board to allow Tosco to increase the amount of the toxic chemical
dioxin it discharged into the San Francisco Bay.</LD>
<LD>   Simon called the June 2000 decision "yet another sorry chapter in
the Gray Davis pay-for-play story, a pathetic pattern that has played
itself out over Davis' entire career."</LD>
<TE>   "He has no qualms whatsoever about selling out our health and our
children's health," the GOP nominee added, standing at the edge of a
North Beach pier, surrounded by several dozen cheering supporters.</TE>
<TE>   The contribution by Tosco and the dioxin discharge is also the
subject of Simon's latest ad, the first the financially strapped
campaign has run since the beginning of the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Aides to the governor said Davis never communicated with the six
members of the San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board,
which at the time of the decision was made up of three Davis
appointees and three members appointed by former Gov. Pete Wilson.
(Davis had reappointed one of the Wilson appointees.)</TE>
<TE>   "He had no role in it whatsoever," said Davis campaign spokesman
Roger Salazar, noting that the current chairman of the board, a
Wilson appointee, said Davis never attempted to influence their
decision. "Mr. Simon has a complete absence of facts."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, staff members on the regional water quality board
recommended the change before the contribution was made, according to
Loretta Barsamian, the water board's executive officer.</TE>
<TE>   "I can guarantee you that the staff does not know who gave the
governor a campaign contribution," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Barsamian said that the amount of dioxin that refineries are
allowed to discharge is minuscule, noting that diesel-burning cars,
fireplaces and storm water are the main sources of the chemical found
in the bay. "We're not talking about major, major loads going into
the bay," she said. "We're talking about a point followed by 15
zeroes."</TE>
<TE>   But Simon continued to hammer at the issue Tuesday, distributing a
November 1999 letter that 10 Bay Area members of Congress wrote to
Davis asking the governor to phase out the discharge of dioxin, which
is linked to cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "Every single time, the governor's people say there is no
connection whatsoever," Simon said. "After a while, credibility gets
strained. And I have to say, I think the people of California's
credibility is now strained to the breaking point."</TE>
<TE>   Simon also tried to remind voters of last week's two-day visit by
President Bush, who attended three fund-raisers for him. "President
Bush has brought honor and respect to the Oval Office, as he
promised," Simon said. "If I am fortunate enough to receive the
people's support this November, I will do the same for the governor's
office."</TE>

<HD>Schools to End Soda Sales</HD>
<DH>L.A. Unified: The soft drinks won't be allowed on campuses
starting in 2004. They may be replaced by more healthful beverages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bubbles burst Tuesday night for students who drink soda on
campuses of the Los Angeles Unified School District.</LD>
<LD>   The Board of Education voted unanimously to ban the sale of the
soft drinks at all of the district's 677 schools in an effort to
improve the health of 736,000 students.</LD>
<LD>   "This is absolutely the right thing to do," said Board President
Caprice Young. "But I wish we could have chosen an implementation
plan that would have made it less painful for the schools."</LD>
<TE>   More than 200 middle and high schools in the Los Angeles district
now have individual contracts with Coca-Cola Co. or PepsiCo Inc. for
vending machines or sales in student stores. Those campuses will have
until January 2004 to replace carbonated sugary beverages with water,
juice, milk or sports drinks during school hours. That could cost
them thousands of dollars, because many Los Angeles schools earn
substantial revenue from soda sales.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Jefferson High School made $88,342 last year, and
Belmont High School netted $50,742, according to the district. The
profits go toward student funds for school dances, sports, clubs or
field trips.</TE>
<TE>   By a 4-3 vote, board members rejected a proposal by Young and
board member Mike Lansing that would have required the district to
come up with a plan to replace the funds. Another proposal by Lansing
that the board set aside $3 million out of next year's budget for the
same purpose also lost.</TE>
<TE>   Board member Marlene Canter, who spearheaded the soda ban motion,
objected to tacking a financial commitment to the initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't yet know what the impact of this is going to be, and
we're jumping the gun by assuming strife," she said.</TE>
<TE>   About 50 students and teachers gathered outside the Downtown
Business Magnet High School, where the board was meeting, to support
the soda ban. They taped signs to the wall that read: "Loyalty to
Education, Not to Coca Cola" and "Don't Brand Our Kids."</TE>
<TE>   "It's wrong to assume that most teens don't care what they put
into their body," said Raul Hernandez, 17, a student at Francisco
Bravo Medical Magnet High School. "I play basketball, and we want
something other than soda. It just makes you more thirsty, and it
tastes nasty."</TE>
<TE>   Rosemary Lee, a teacher at Logan Street Elementary School, also
wanted an end to soda sales in the district.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a health issue. I have kindergartners who are 90 pounds at 4
or 5 years old. I have kids who come to school with a soda for
breakfast," she said.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky addressed the board, commending
it for "taking steps today that, I think, will have ramifications all
across the country."</TE>
<TE>   "When you hear people say this is going to cost you some dollars
out of the school uniform account, I am very sympathetic to that," he
said. "However, the costs to them for the rest of their lives is much
deeper."</TE>
<TE>   The motion was co-sponsored by board members Canter, Genethia
Hudley-Hayes and Julie Korenstein.</TE>
<TE>   Lansing, who worried about the loss of school funds, suggested the
action wasn't the way to address health problems among the district's
children.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm afraid, as too often, this is a little more about the hype
than about addressing the obesity epidemic," Lansing said. "To equate
the banning of sodas with ending obesity is not adequate."</TE>
<TE>   Supt. Roy Romer, who during the meeting announced that he suffers
from Type 2 diabetes, asked the board to continue to look at ways to
address obesity and poor health.</TE>
<TE>"We ought to be very careful to look at the diet we promote as well
as the exercise," he said. "I support the effort. It ought not to be
the end of it."</TE>
<TE>   When the motion passed, a crowd of supporters erupted in applause
and cheers.</TE>
<TE>   The idea to ban soda was inspired, in part, by recent reports
spotlighting the obesity epidemic in Los Angeles, including a UCLA
survey that found that 40% of 900 students in 14 Los Angeles Unified
schools were obese.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in January 2004, schools may no longer sell soft drinks
in vending machines or at student stores during school hours. Sodas
may, however, be sold on campus starting 30 minutes after the school
day is over, at events such as football games.</TE>
<TE>   Coca-Cola Co. sells the soft drinks Fresca, Barq's Root Beer and
Sprite as well as Coke. Schools may replace sodas offered by
Coca-Cola with non-soda products from the company, including Minute
Maid juice, Powerade and Dasani water.</TE>
<TE>   PepsiCo markets such soft drinks as Mountain Dew, Mug Root
Beer and Slice as well as Pepsi. Schools may choose PepsiCo's
noncarbonated options, including Gatorade, Aquafina water and
Tropicana or Dole juices.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified is the largest school district in the country to ban
soft drinks. The 55,000-student Oakland Unified School District
implemented a similar policy last year, banning sodas and junk food
on its campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Also beginning in 2004, public elementary schools in California
will not be allowed to sell junk food or soda, as part of legislation
signed into law last October by Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   In May, a proposal to phase out the sale of sodas in all
California schools was killed. Anti-soda legislation has also been
unsuccessful in Maryland, Oklahoma and Kentucky. Texas prohibits the
sale of junk food on all campuses.</TE>

<HD>Psychedelic Neverland Faces Taming, Rebirth as State Park</HD>
<DH>Culture: In a clash of two Bay Area passions, anarchic art
is likely to give way to open space.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALBANY, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The Popsicle-shaped peninsula known as the Albany Bulb sits atop an
old landfill on a narrow causeway jutting into San Francisco Bay.</LD>
<LD>   There are remnants of concrete and rebar, even the carcass of a
boat, in the tidal flats below. Thickets of fennel smell like
licorice. Flocks of geese soar by, and fat bumblebees ride the tips
of wild mustard like urban cowboys on mechanical bulls.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly, a sculpture blocks the path. It's the "wheel of life"--a
spool of old cable that can be set spinning until the arrow lands
between an image of Pegasus and a heart pierced by a dagger. Is this
art? Junk? What does it mean? Sometimes it's more fun to wonder than
to know.</LD>
<TE>   For years, the lawless, homeless and aimless have flocked to "the
Bulb," erecting a psychedelic neverland atop a giant pile of trash.
All of it will be torn down sometime soon, if recreation officials
have their way.</TE>
<TE>   They are about to begin piecing together the new 2,000-acre
$40-million to $80-million Eastshore State Park, hugging the bay
shore north of Oakland, including the 40-odd acres that make up the
Bulb. Once that happens, the public officials say, there will be no
place for the art or, as they call it, "unauthorized personal
expression."</TE>
<TE>   Around a fire pit, would-be poets have painted slogans on concrete
bricks, from the nonsensical ("River: Noun or verb?") to the
political (" 'Do what thou wilt' shall be the whole of the law"). A
makeshift amphitheater is ringed with interlocking pieces of old
bicycles. Someone has managed to piece together a two-story castle,
complete with a rooftop porch and a nappy armchair offering
spectacular views of Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the untamed acreage will be replaced by soccer fields,
picnic tables, hiking trails and open space. People on all sides of
the issue agree that, even before the work begins, the outlaw spirit
has begun to fade, and that the artists will pack up and leave
voluntarily.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurts me that it has come to this," said Don Neuwirth, a
consultant working as the planning manager for the web of
environmental and recreation officials behind the park.</TE>
<TE>   Neuwirth embodies the ambivalence of many of the bureaucrats
pushing out the art, seen as an amusement, in favor of regulation,
seen as a necessity.</TE>
<TE>   "It is really cool out there. It is wild and romantic, and these
guys just want to be left alone," he said. "I'm from New York, and
Norman Mailer thought the coolest thing in the world was graffiti on
subway cars. Who am I to argue with Norman Mailer?</TE>
<TE>   "But I don't want to pay for a park and look at someone's personal
expression any more than I want to get on the subway and look at
someone's graffiti. We're not making an aesthetic decision about this
art. We're making a hard public policy decision."</TE>
<TE>   This is not some stereotypical clash of crazed lefties against
some fat-cat developer. The state wants to build a park here that
features improved bird habitats, hiking trails, ramps to launch
kayaks, even a youth hostel where the kids and the troubadours can
stay on the cheap.</TE>
<TE>   That has thrown into conflict two prime passions of the Bay Area:
art and open space. Avowed anarchists back the art; community
activists and bureaucrats are behind the park. The anarchists know
they will lose. So this summer offers a last look, in a sense, at a
relic of fading free-form San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty much over. The Bay Area has now turned into the rest
of the country," said Bruce Rayburn, a building contractor, San
Francisco native and one of the artists who frequents the Bulb.</TE>
<TE>   "We've become this milquetoast Middle America.... This place is a
masterpiece. But now we will be the same as everyplace else."</TE>
<TE>   As one hand-painted sign jammed into a mudflat reads: "How about a
place for just being?"</TE>
<TE>   For decades, local authorities let it be just that. First there
was a dump at the Bulb, filled with construction materials and other
debris. Then the tides of the bay floated in, spreading earth, exotic
yard wastes and a wide variety of plants and trees--from towering
pines to thorny roses.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 20 years ago, community activists launched the notion of
creating a full-fledged park there, a concept later linked to the
large waterfront park proposed for the East Bay.</TE>
<TE>   But the wheels of government turn slowly. California has spent
about $30 million buying the pieces of property that make up the
park, and the state Parks Commission is expected to adopt a final
plan for the park in November. The state doesn't expect to begin
mowing, grooming and building for another 18 months after that vote.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulb found its latest incarnation in 1999, when a large
encampment of homeless people was moved off the land, but not before
they began making sculptures out of the construction debris.</TE>
<TE>   A loose-knit group of artists responded to the eviction by
erecting two large bisecting arcs made of shopping carts, a tribute
to the carry-all of choice for many street people.</TE>
<TE>   The artists never left. They created their own lawless playground,
often partying late into the night using old car batteries to power
generators and radios.</TE>
<TE>   Among the works they created are a series of elaborate murals. One
is a painting of a rodeo gone very wrong, featuring an image of a
stuck pig and a dog with fleas. Another contains a rather violent
image of a man in a trench coat attacking a beggar. "A curse upon the
souls of those who maliciously destroy the efforts of others," it
says.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Dubberke, a Berkeley resident and labor lawyer who counts
himself among the artists, has spent three years, off and on,
building a wall made of slag, part of the "amphitheater."</TE>
<TE>   "It's really just a big pile of garbage with a bunch of wildlife,"
he said. "It is a metaphor for how nature can reclaim something that
was basically a bunch of human waste. It's magic. And it's mystery."</TE>
<TE>   It's also illegal: The Albany City Council recently voted
unanimously that artwork should not be incorporated into the city's
portion of Eastshore State Park.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have concluded that the artwork is a potential liability
because children could climb on it and fall. There also are concerns
that the artwork does not mesh with the state's duties to provide
open space and recreational opportunities, and that some of its
content is not appropriate for children, said Ron Schafer,
superintendent of the California Department of Parks and Recreation's
Bay Area district.</TE>
<TE>   "They are taking advantage of one of the last wild and unregulated
places," said Ann Ritzma, Albany's assistant city administrator. "But
soon it will be regulated."</TE>
<TE>   Even some of those who understand the charms of the Bulb believe
the greater good requires change.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very marvelous place, but it is doomed," said Jim
McGrath, an environmental official at the Port of Oakland and a
Berkeley resident who has lobbied for the park since the mid-1970s.
"To make it a park, you have to have some level of improvements.
Otherwise, the only people who can use it are the people who happened
to find it. And that's not fair."</TE>
<TE>   But the regulars who come to visit this untamed place can't help
but feel there are many public parks and only one place like the
Bulb.</TE>
<TE>   A sign on the land suggests their spirit won't die easily. Beneath
a picture of a coiled rattlesnake, it reads:</TE>
<TE>   "Artists may be found in this area. They are important members of
the community. They will not attack but if disturbed or cornered they
will defend themselves. Give them distance and respect."</TE>

<HD>Firm to Pay $25,000 Fine Over Deaths of Fish in '99</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A contractor has agreed to pay a $25,000 fine in connection with the
deaths of more than a dozen fish, including two federally protected
steelhead trout, authorities said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   An Anaheim-based firm, Myers Polich A Joint Venture, did not admit
any wrongdoing in the 3-year-old case but agreed to the penalties in
an agreement signed by Superior Court Judge Melinda A. Johnson,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   At the time the dead fish were found in 1999, authorities said the
incident was one of the worst cases ever in Ventura County involving
destruction of an endangered species. "This was a significant case
because there were actually fish that were killed," Deputy Dist.
Atty. Laurel McWaters said. "You rarely have that kind of direct
evidence."</LD>
<TE>   The contractor was hired by the California Department of
Transportation in 1999 for a $3-million project to replace a
70-year-old bridge over Tule Creek, about five miles north of Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   In August 1999, during construction, work crews allegedly placed a
plastic sheet on the creek's surface to catch debris, action that led
to the fish deaths. The company also failed to obtain proper permits
for the project, McWaters said.</TE>
<TE>   A private biologist who visited the construction site discovered
the damage. At least 13 fish died and two dozen more were affected
and had to be relocated, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The incident occurred at a pool on the tiny creek, an important
spawning ground for steelhead trout. At first, authorities had
considered filing civil or criminal charges against Caltrans but
decided against such action. McWaters said Tuesday she did not
believe a case against Caltrans could have been proven in court.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The parents of a 17-year-old boy slain in a drive-by shooting outside
a Canoga Park school for juvenile offenders have filed a government
claim against the Los Angeles County Office of Education and the city
of Los Angeles, alleging that a security guard should have been on
duty at the site.</LD>
<LD>   Police say Michael Urquidi was shot in the chest by an unknown
gang member Jan. 8 as classes ended at the Canoga Park Leadership
Academy, which is operated by the county Office of Education.</LD>
<LD>   The boy's parents say his death could have been prevented if a
security guard had stood watch outside the facility. A memorandum of
understanding between the city and the Office of Education requires a
security guard to be on site from 30 minutes before school starts
until one hour after it ends.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Office of Education would not comment because
he had not seen the claim, which is a precursor to a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Frank and Maria Urquidi, Michael's parents, appeared at a news
conference in front of the county administration building in downtown
Los Angeles on Aug. 21. The conference was arranged by two teachers
at the Canoga Park Leadership Academy who allege that Michael's death
points to widespread mismanagement of the Office of Education.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the teachers' allegations, the county said in a
statement that it was "deeply saddened by the tragic shooting" and
"took all necessary steps to ensure the safety of students at the
site."</TE>

<HD>Anthrax Probe Back in Florida</HD>
<DH>Bioterrorism: Agents use new methods to identify source at
quarantined American Media site.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOCA RATON, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Federal agents wearing protective gear entered the quarantined home
of the National Enquirer on Tuesday in hopes of reviving their
stalled inquiry into last year's deadly anthrax attack.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators needed to photograph and survey the layout of the
headquarters of tabloid publisher American Media Inc. before they
began searching for evidence. FBI Special Agent Wayne Russell would
not give details about anything the agents found Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   FBI officials said they originally focused on the public health
threat following the anthrax contamination and now want to search the
building more thoroughly.</LD>
<TE>   Scientists recently developed techniques to search for anthrax
spores and identify their source, and the FBI is hoping to find the
letter, package or other item by which the deadly anthrax was brought
into the building.</TE>
<TE>   The operation is expected to take about two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities previously found spores on the desk of photo editor
Robert Stevens, the first of five people who died during last fall's
anthrax attacks. Another American Media worker became ill and was
hospitalized more than three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Hector Pesquera, the FBI's special agent in charge of the Miami
division, stressed that the operation "has nothing to do" with Steven
J. Hatfill, a biowarfare expert whom Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft has
called a "person of interest" in the anthrax investigation. Hatfill
has repeatedly denied involvement.</TE>
<TE>   The building has been under federal quarantine since October. AMI
has had to use other offices in the area to publish its six
supermarket tabloids, including the Enquirer, Globe and Weekly World
News.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Better Prepared for Bioterrorism Attack, Health
Officials Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After 11 months of preparing for the worst, the nation's top health
officials sought Tuesday to assure Americans they are much safer from
a bioterrorism attack than they were a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, they said, much remains to be done to prepare
the nation for a smallpox, anthrax, plague or other bioterror attack
that government officials are convinced is all but inevitable.</LD>
<LD>   Mindful that the coming Sept. 11 anniversary retrospectives will
turn an analytical eye on what the government has done to protect
Americans from future terrorist attacks, government health officials
in Washington and Atlanta, headquarters of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, touted their accomplishments and highlighted
some of the remaining challenges.</LD>
<TE>   ''We are much better prepared than the American public thinks we
are,'' Tommy G. Thompson, secretary of Health and Human Services,
told reporters after addressing the first meeting of his public
health preparedness advisory council.</TE>
<TE>   ''We will continue to do as much as we can as fast as we can,''
Dr. Julie Gerberding, director of the CDC, said at a teleconference
in Atlanta. ''We are scaling up, speeding up and streamlining.''</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, an alphabet soup of government agencies at federal, state
and local levels has worked with uncommon speed and coordination--and
a tenfold increase in federal funding--to prepare for a bioterrorism
attack.</TE>
<TE>   The integration of public health agencies and private health care
providers at all levels is critical because ''bioterror agents don't
recognize borders and they don't recognize ZIP codes,'' said Robert
A. Malson, president of the District of Columbia Hospital Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Among the concrete results of the year's work are improved
communication networks, modernized laboratories, health care workers
who are better able to recognize the symptoms of a bioterror attack,
stockpiles of antibiotics and vaccines that can be delivered anywhere
in the country within 12 hours, plans for hospital isolation rooms
and off-site treatment areas, and strategies to vaccinate as many as
1 million people in 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   ''If we can prepare for the worst, we ought to be able to handle
anything less than that,'' said Dr. Lisa Rotz, chief epidemiologist
for the CDC's bioterrorism preparedness and response program.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, however, preparation will require difficult,
somewhat political, decisions.</TE>
<TE>   While Thompson praised his department for arranging to have more
than 209 million doses of smallpox vaccine by the end of the year,
the government has not yet decided who should be vaccinated, or when.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is critical because smallpox, a highly contagious
disease, is considered the most serious bioterrorism threat, and
vaccination is effective in preventing it--even after a person has
been exposed to the virus if no symptoms have developed. At the same
time, the vaccine itself poses risks, especially to people with
compromised immune systems.</TE>
<TE>   Public health officials have been anxiously awaiting a final
smallpox vaccination decision for more than two months, ever since a
national advisory panel recommended limiting preventive vaccination
to the health care and emergency response workers who would be most
likely to treat victims of a smallpox attack.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson said Tuesday he had submitted his recommendation to the
White House, and hoped there would soon be a decision.</TE>
<TE>   ''Many of these decisions are going to be incredibly tough, and
there is no absolute right or wrong,'' said Michael T. Osterholm,
director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious
Disease Research and Policy. ''We're going to have to hang together
and help the community understand the decision.''</TE>
<TE>   Public health experts agreed that the nation's preparedness effort
had benefited from a shared sense of urgency.</TE>

<HD>Georgia Crematory Operator Jailed in Body Dumping Case
Freed on Bail</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LAFAYETTE, Ga.</DL>
<LD>A Georgia crematory operator jailed since February on allegations he
took money for cremations and dumped 339 bodies on his property was
released on bail Tuesday, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Ray Brent Marsh, operator of the Tri-State Crematory in Noble,
Ga., was picked up at the Walker County Jail by his lawyer, according
to the county sheriff's office.</LD>
<LD>   Marsh, 29, has been held since Feb. 17 on 339 charges of theft by
deception stemming from the discovery of the corpses stacked in
sheds, scattered in the woods and buried on the property around the
crematory his family owns. Noble is 100 miles northwest of Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   Marsh's bail was set in July, and he and his family have worked
since then to raise the $159,000 bond, including $39,000 in cash,
Marsh needed to be released.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff Steve Wilson said that Marsh would essentially be held
under house arrest at his parents' home. He must wear an electronic
ankle bracelet that tracks his whereabouts and police will make
unannounced visits each week.</TE>

<HD>Powder in Mail Found at Gore Office</HD>
<DH>Crime: Incident in Nashville occurs as former vice
president is on vacation. FBI agent sees it as 'anthrax hoax.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>A suspicious powder spilled from an envelope opened Tuesday at the
Nashville office of former Vice President Al Gore in what one FBI
agent referred to as an "anthrax hoax case."</LD>
<LD>   Gore spokesman Jano Cabrera said the envelope was received in the
mail Monday. It was opened Tuesday by an office manager and the white
powder spilled from it, Cabrera said. He described the piece of mail
as "smaller than a usual envelope."</LD>
<LD>   The contents of the envelope were being tested.</LD>
<TE>   "No one has been transported because of medical reasons, and no
suspects have been identified," said Jon Stephens, spokesman for the
FBI in Nashville. "Right now, we are referring to it as an anthrax
hoax case."</TE>
<TE>   Gore was on vacation in California and not in the office Tuesday,
but he was informed of the incident, the spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   The room where the letter was opened was quarantined and a
hazardous materials team was investigating, said Cabrera, who is
based at Gore's Washington area office.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Chief Kim Lawson of the Nashville Fire Department said
the office would be closed until results from tests on materials
taken from the office were known.</TE>
<TE>   Cabrera said the envelope was postmarked from Tennessee and was
stamped on the back with, "This letter has not been inspected by the
corrections department."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Hayes, Tennessee Department of Correction spokesman, said it
is policy to stamp letters that have not been inspected but the
wording the department uses is different from the Gore letter.</TE>
<TE>   The office, which opened as Gore's Tennessee base of operations in
July 2001, is in the Loew's Vanderbilt Plaza Hotel and office complex
west of downtown. The building was not evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   There has been a series of white powder scares--most of them
hoaxes--following anthrax mailings after the attacks of Sept. 11.
Twenty-three people were believed to have contracted anthrax from the
mailings last year, five of whom died, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention said.</TE>

<HD>White House Defends Its Shielding of Clinton's Pardon
Papers</HD>
<DH>Courts: Bush officials ask judge to reject a suit seeking
records related to controversial actions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration defended its decision Tuesday to keep secret
thousands of pages of government records involving the pardons
President Clinton granted on his last day in office.</LD>
<LD>   "The president is entitled to receive confidential advice and
candid assessments from government attorneys," said White House
spokesman Scott McClellan.</LD>
<LD>   In court briefs filed two weeks ago, administration lawyers asked
a federal judge to throw out a Freedom of Information Act request for
more than 5,000 pages of Justice Department files that concerned
Clinton's pardons.</LD>
<TE>   Although the president alone has the power to issue pardons, he
usually seeks advice and recommendations from prosecutors and prison
officials. The deputy attorney general and the Office of Pardons in
the Justice Department coordinate this effort and submit their
recommendations to the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton handed down 177 pardons or commutations as he was leaving
office, including highly controversial decisions to spare fugitive
financier Marc Rich and to free several convicted drug dealers.</TE>
<TE>   But a president cannot be sued for his "official acts" and is not
subject to the Freedom of Information Act.</TE>
<TE>   Judicial Watch, a self-styled watchdog group, instead filed a FOIA
suit against the Justice Department in February 2001 seeking all its
memos and files that dealt with Clinton's pardons.</TE>
<TE>   Administration lawyers told U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler
that they had released 1,030 pages of records, most of which dealt
generally with the pardon process. But they had decided to withhold
4,341 pages of advice and recommendations involving specific cases.</TE>
<TE>   They urged the judge to reject the lawsuit over the remaining
files, arguing that confidential advice to the president is protected
from disclosure. They pointed to Section 5 of the Freedom of
Information Act, which says that "inter-agency or intra-agency
memorandums and letters" involving policymaking can be withheld by
the government. Moreover, the memos at issue in this case gave advice
to the president, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "Those records that the plaintiff seeks were authored or solicited
and received by Department officials in the course of preparing and
providing information and recommendations to assist the President in
the exercise of his constitutional pardon power [and] fall within the
presidential communications privilege and are therefore protected
from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 5," the department lawyers wrote
in their brief.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Bush White House has strongly asserted executive powers
and a president's right to operate in secret, officials described the
dispute over the pardon requests as routine.</TE>
<TE>   This is "a standard, straightforward case dealing with the Freedom
of Information Act. It is not about executive privilege," said
presidential Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, reacted angrily to the
White House response. "They are being disingenuous. They are keeping
secret a boatload of documents that are normally available under
FOIA," he said. "There is generally a deal here between the political
parties where they protect each other. It's arrogant and lawless."</TE>
<TE>   Fitton conceded that "FOIA has lots of loopholes" and the
government can withhold a large amount of information.</TE>
<TE>   Kessler has yet to rule in the case.</TE>
<TE>   After Clinton left office, a prosecutor in New York and a House
committee in Washington looked into possible corruption dealings
involving the pardons, but no charges have been brought.</TE>

<HD>Polygamist Is Sentenced in Utah Child Rape Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: Tom Green gets five years to life, the lightest
possible term. He admits he was wrong.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEPHI, Utah</DL>
<LD>A polygamist was sentenced Tuesday to spend five years to life in
prison for a child rape that occurred when he took a 13-year-old girl
as his "spiritual" wife more than a dozen years ago.</LD>
<LD>   It was the lightest possible sentence for raping a child. Tom
Green, who is serving a sentence for bigamy and failure to pay child
support, could have received at least 15 years in prison, the judge
said.</LD>
<LD>   Before the sentence was handed down, Green cried as he told the
judge he was wrong to have married Linda Kunz when she was so young.</LD>
<TE>   "I recognize, under the law, she was not capable of consenting to
marriage," Green said.</TE>
<TE>   This latest sentence will run concurrently with the bigamy
sentence, and Green could be out of prison in four years, his
attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   Green, who drew the attention of prosecutors when he appeared on
six nationally televised talk shows, was convicted in June of child
rape for marrying and conceiving a child with Kunz in 1986 when she
was 13 and he was 37.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not consider myself a victim," Kunz said, sobbing as she
begged Judge Donald Eyre for leniency. "I'm a 30-year-old woman who
has seven children."</TE>
<TE>   "It was me who pursued him. It was me who fell in love," Kunz
said.</TE>
<TE>   Eyre said his sentence was influenced by Green's strong family
relationship and Kunz's defense of her husband.</TE>
<TE>   Melvin, the 15-year-old son of Green and Kunz, also took the
stand.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't consider myself a victim of my father or the product of a
crime," the boy told the judge.</TE>
<TE>   Green, 53, has held out his practice of plural marriage as a
God-given path to salvation. Until he was imprisoned, Green lived
with five wives and 29 children in a cluster of trailer homes in
Utah's west desert, 126 miles southwest of Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Kunz was Green's stepdaughter before their "spiritual" marriage. A
Utah court declared the two legally married as part of Green's
earlier bigamy trial.</TE>

<HD>4 Priests Charged in Detroit Abuse Cases</HD>
<DH>Crime: Officials accuse the suspects of sexual misconduct
dating back decades.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Taking advantage of a provision in Michigan's statute of limitations,
authorities charged four Roman Catholic priests who once worked in
the Detroit Archdiocese with sex abuse in cases dating back decades.</LD>
<LD>   None of the priests is still active, and all live in other
states--which is the main reason prosecutors were able to charge them
Tuesday, Wayne County Prosecutor Mike Duggan said.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors used an exception in the old statute of limitations
law that allows charges to be brought if the suspect left the state
before the six-year statute ran out.</LD>
<TE>   The charged priests are: Robert Burkholder, 82, who lives on the
island of Oahu, Hawaii; Jason E. Sigler, 64, of New Mexico; Harry
Benjamin, 60, of Vienna, Va.; and Edward Olszewski, 67, of Key Largo,
Fla. Each man is accused of criminal sexual conduct involving a boy
14 or younger.</TE>
<TE>   "The magnitude of this is astonishing," Duggan said.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Adam Maida said the charges were "serious and sobering
news for the priests and people of the Archdiocese of Detroit."</TE>
<TE>   At least 300 priests have been suspended or have resigned since
the abuse crisis erupted in January with the case of a former Boston
priest who was shuffled between parishes despite evidence he molested
children.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors nationwide have been reviewing diocesan personnel
records to see whether criminal charges should be brought against
priests accused of sexually abusing minors.</TE>
<TE>   But civil authorities have so far found only a few that fall
within the statute of limitations.</TE>
<TE>   American bishops agreed at a meeting in June to remove all errant
priests from public ministry and to turn more information over to
prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   In Detroit, the archdiocese released internal records in May about
abuse allegations made against priests over the last 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials then gave Duggan's office files with accusations
that went back further.</TE>
<TE>   Duggan said 15 of those priests would have been charged if not for
the statute of limitations.</TE>
<TE>   He also said that Burkholder admitted in a 1993 letter to the
archdiocese that he had molested 23 boys, going as far back as the
1940s--though he is charged in a case dating from the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "Father Burkholder's means of seduction was to tell these young
boys, many of whom were altar boys, that their bodies were gifts from
God and therefore were to be shared" with the priest, Duggan said.</TE>

<HD>Nevada School District Settles Gay Harassment Suit</HD>
<DH>Courts: Reno officials agree to pay student $451,000 and
institute a policy letting pupils be open about orientation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reno school authorities agreed Tuesday to a wide-ranging settlement
of a gay rights lawsuit, instituting a stringent anti-harassment
policy and paying $451,000 to a gay youth who was driven from local
schools.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement is "the first in the country to recognize the
constitutional right of gay and lesbian youth to be open about their
sexual orientation in schools and to be protected from discrimination
and harassment by other students," according to lawyers for the
youth, Derek R. Henkle.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for the Washoe County, Nev., School District, agreed,
saying the district's new policy allows gay students to speak out and
prohibits harassment that creates "an intimidating, hostile or
offensive school environment."</LD>
<TE>   The policy grants gays, as others, freedom of expression to take
part in student activities, voice their opinions in school
publications, enter election campaigns and participate in student
clubs. It prohibits anyone from taking actions that "cause a
substantial disruption of or material interference with school
activities" or are "vulgar, lewd, obscene or plainly offensive."</TE>
<TE>   The case could have a major influence on school districts across
the country, according to USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky.</TE>
<TE>   "It is possible there have been unpublished settlements on gay
rights between individual plaintiffs and school districts elsewhere
in the country," Chemerinsky said. "But this is public, and that
makes it more influential."</TE>
<TE>   Henkle is due to hold a news conference in San Francisco today to
detail his plans to use the money to pursue a college education.</TE>
<TE>   Henkle was subjected to "a constant barrage of harassment,
assaults, intimidation and discrimination" after he went on a public
access television program to discuss being gay and his experience in
the Reno schools, according to his lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit was filed by lawyers for the Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund, a gay rights organization, and the national law firm
of O'Melveny &amp; Myers.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, fellow students used disparaging epithets to describe
Henkle. Several threatened to tie him to the back of a truck and drag
him down a road. On the same occasion, he was lassoed around the neck
three times with a rope on school grounds. When he managed to escape
and call a vice principal for help, she delayed responding for two
hours and then laughed at his recounting of the incident, according
to the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   In one class, the complaint said, students wrote epithets on the
blackboard and drew pictures of men engaged in sexual activity while
the teacher did nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Henkle was transferred to two other high schools, where the
harassment and physical abuse continued. Finally, the complaint said,
an administrator placed Henkle in an adult education program at a
community college at the age of 16.</TE>
<TE>   According to the policy, Reno schools must:</TE>
<TE>   * Acknowledge that students' freedom of expression includes the
right to discuss their sexual orientation, and issues related to
orientation, at school.</TE>
<TE>   * Require regular student education about harassment and sexual
harassment and intimidation.</TE>

of and proper response to harassment and intimidation.</TE>
<TE>   * Require posting of the policy and implementing regulations in
all district buildings and in student handbooks.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement rules out additional claims by both sides, and
states that costs and fees amounting to $92,453 incurred by Henkle in
his suit will be paid for out of the $451,000 he is receiving from
the district.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the legal work in the case was done pro bono, or for
nothing except costs, lawyers said.</TE>

<HD>Memo Links Terrorist Suspect to Plot</HD>
<DH>Crime: Reports from sources conflict on man accused of
planning 'dirty' bomb attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Several intelligence sources have indicated that terrorist suspect
Jose Padilla learned how to build a radioactive bomb after being
directed to a safe house in Pakistan by a senior leader of Al Qaeda,
according to a previously classified government memo.</LD>
<LD>   But the memo, written by Defense Department advisor Michael Hobbs
and released Tuesday by the Justice Department, states that other
intelligence shows that Padilla was not a member of Al Qaeda and
there was no attack timetable.</LD>
<LD>   Hobbs wrote that some of the people who provided information on
Padilla may be trying to mislead the U.S. government.</LD>
<TE>   The memo was included with a government court filing in which
Justice Department attorneys defended the military's detention of
Padilla without a trial.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla's attorney, Donna Newman, had asked the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York to order the government
to give Padilla a trial.</TE>
<TE>   In the government's response, officials revealed for the first
time how they came to suspect Padilla of being involved in a plot.
Two Al Qaeda prisoners held outside the United States accused
Padilla, the memo says.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Padilla approached senior Al Qaeda lieutenant Abu
Zubaydah with a proposal to conduct terrorist attacks within the
United States, the memo states.</TE>
<TE>   Zubaydah, who is now in the custody of the U.S. military, directed
Padilla to travel to Pakistan for training in wiring explosives from
Al Qaeda operatives. There, Padilla researched how to construct a
"dirty" bomb--a device that spreads radiation without causing a
nuclear explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Hobbs writes in the memo that Padilla met with Al Qaeda officials
twice. This year, he and Al Qaeda officials discussed the possibility
of blowing up gas stations or hotels in a series of coordinated
attacks on the U.S., the memo states.</TE>
<TE>   Some of that data have been corroborated, the memo says, but some
"confidential sources have not been completely candid.... Some
information provided by the sources remains uncorroborated and may be
part of an effort to mislead or confuse U.S. officials."</TE>
<TE>   The memo states that one of the sources recanted much of the
information he provided and one source was being treated with
"various types of drugs to treat medical conditions."</TE>
<TE>   Padilla, 31, is being held in a military brig in South Carolina as
an enemy combatant.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Mulder has a different record in mind for the Oakland Athletics.</LD>
<LD>   The Bash Brothers of Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco set the Oakland
standard by winning 14 consecutive games in 1988.</LD>
<LD>   The 2002 Athletics matched that Tuesday night with a 6-4 victory
over the Kansas City Royals at Kansas City, Mo. A's starting pitchers
have accounted for 13 of the 14 victories during the streak.</LD>
<TE>   "The '88 team made it to the World Series," said Mulder, who won
his third consecutive start. "We'll talk about it once we do a little
bit more than this."</TE>
<TE>   The streak is the longest in the majors since Seattle won 15 in a
row last season. The franchise record is a 17-game streak in 1931
when the team played in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't been making too many mistakes," Mulder said. "We've
played solid ball. We've been playing good defense, pitching well and
hitting well. All around, we're just playing good ball."</TE>
<TE>   The A's 3.69 earned-run average is the best in the American
League.</TE>
<TE>   David Justice led the A's offense against the Royals with three
hits, including his 10th home run, and drove in three runs.</TE>
<TE>   Mulder (16-7) gave up four runs and seven hits in seven-plus
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Koch pitched the ninth for his 35th save in 40
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Durham homered off Runelvys Hernandez (3-3) in the fifth for
the A's, who scored single runs in the third through eighth innings.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Randa had three hits for the Royals, including a two-run
triple in the eighth off Jim Mecir. Carlos Beltran had an RBI single
earlier in the inning to end Mulder's outing.</TE>
<TE>   New York 6, Boston 0--David Wells took a shutout into the ninth
inning to win for the eighth time in nine decisions, and the Yankees
padded their lead in the AL East with a victory at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees lead the Red Sox by eight games in the division, with
four games left between the two teams over the next eight days.</TE>
<TE>   One night after the Red Sox pounded out 18 hits in an emotional,
10-9 extra-inning victory over the Angels, they managed only two
singles and three doubles against Wells (15-6). In all, Wells struck
out six and walked none before leaving after Johnny Damon's leadoff
double in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 5, Seattle 2--Torii Hunter and Jacque Jones backed Joe
Mays (3-5) with solo homers in the Twins' victory at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter was three for four for the Twins, who have won six of
eight. After losing eight of nine to the AL West champion Mariners
last season, the Twins are 3-2 against them this year.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota's Cristian Guzman went 0 for 4, ending his 23-game
hitting streak.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 8, Cleveland 5--Mark Redman pitched eight strong innings
at Cleveland to win for the first time in five starts and help the
Tigers end a six-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Redman (8-12) survived a three-run rally in the fourth and got
some run support from Damion Easley and Bobby Higginson, who had two
RBIs each.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Pena homered for the Tigers.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 8, Toronto 4--Joe Crede tied the score with a two-run
homer off Kelvim Escobar in the bottom of the ninth inning and won it
in the 10th against Felix Heredia with the first grand slam of his
career.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 9, Baltimore 4--Alex Rodriguez and Herbert Perry homered and
Carl Everett went four for four at Arlington, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez hit his major league-leading 47th homer in a three-run
eighth.</TE>

<HD>Angels Find Some Sanctuary</HD>
<DH>Baseball: After a tough East Coast trip, Anaheim gets to
relax at home with a 7-3 victory over Tampa Bay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leave it to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, owners of the worst record in
baseball, to soothe the disappointment of an East Coast swing in
which the Angels lost more games than they won to fall out of first
place in the American League wild-card race.</LD>
<LD>   Tampa Bay has lost 16 consecutive series and features a starting
lineup with players so obscure they probably can't get into Tropicana
Field without identification.</LD>
<LD>   Carl Crawford? Felix Escalona? Someone call security.</LD>
<TE>   If the Angels are to qualify for the postseason for the first time
since 1986, they must feast on major league plankton such as the
Devil Rays, especially since four of the Angels' next five series are
against teams with sub-.500 records.</TE>
<TE>   John Lackey and Darin Erstad got the Angels off to a good start
Tuesday night during a 7-3 victory over Tampa Bay before 19,869 at
Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   Lackey pitched 6 1/3 high-quality innings and Erstad equaled a
career high with five hits to lead the Angels' 16-hit attack.</TE>
<TE>   If the players' strike scheduled for Friday is averted, Tuesday's
victory could be only the beginning of a prolonged run for the
Angels, who improved to 44-18 against teams with records below .500
and 15-1 against teams with records below .400.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are 4-0 against Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   More important, the Angels retook the lead in the wild-card race
after Seattle lost to Minnesota. The Angels (78-53) lead the Mariners
by a half-game but still trail surging Oakland, which notched its
14th consecutive victory with a win over Kansas City, by three games
in the AL West.</TE>
<TE>   Lackey (6-3), a rookie who recorded his first major-league
complete game during his last start, a 4-2 loss to the New York
Yankees, didn't last as long this time but was impressive.</TE>
<TE>   He gave up seven hits and two runs while striking out two and
issuing two walks.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt all night I never got in a prolonged groove, but we got a
win and that's good enough," said Lackey, who has pitched into the
sixth inning or later in 11 of his 12 starts.</TE>
<TE>   Said Angel shortstop David Eckstein: "He's been outstanding for
us. Every outing has been a quality start."</TE>
<TE>   Lackey faced only one batter over the minimum through five innings
before giving up a run in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   In the seventh, Lackey surrendered singles to three of the first
four Devil Rays he faced--including Chris Gomez's run-scoring single
to center that drew Tampa Bay within 3-2--before being relieved by
Brendan Donnelly, who avoided further damage.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Spiezio put the game out of reach in the bottom of the
seventh when he smashed a three-run double over the head of Ben
Grieve in right field.</TE>
<TE>   The hapless Devil Rays (43-88) scored a run in the eighth to make
it 6-3 and then loaded the bases before Angel reliever Ben Weber
struck out Gomez.</TE>
<TE>   Weber pitched a scoreless ninth for his sixth save.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad, who had two doubles and three triples, last registered
five hits in a game June 9, 1998, against the Arizona Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't hit the ball particularly hard," said Erstad, hitting
.394 over his last 17 games. "Just sometimes, you find holes."</TE>
<TE>   Alex Ochoa added to the onslaught, driving in two runs for the
Angels with RBI singles in the second and sixth innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels took a 1-0 lead in the first when Eckstein, who had
reached on an error and moved to third on Erstad's double, scored on
Garret Anderson's slow roller.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay threatened to put together a big inning in the sixth but
came away with only one run after Lackey struck out Jared Sandberg
with two out and runners on second and third. Gomez led off the
inning with a single off the top of Adam Kennedy's glove and took
second on a fielder's choice. After Randy Winn drew a walk on a
3-and-2 count, Crawford singled to center to drive in Gomez. But
Aubrey Huff grounded to first and Sandberg struck out looking to end
the inning.</TE>
<TE>   "[Lackey] made some super pitches in key spots," Angel Manager
Mike Scioscia said. "He had to work for it."</TE>

<LD>Second baseman Chone Figgins and pitcher Mickey Callaway, who had
prolific seasons for triple-A Salt Lake before being called up last
week by the Angels, could be shut out of the major league and minor
league playoffs if a strike wipes out the remainder of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Neither player could return to triple-A Salt Lake for the Pacific
Coast League playoffs if he is a member of the Angels' 25-man roster
when the strike, scheduled to begin Friday, takes effect. If the
strike lasts only a couple of days, Figgins and Callaway could return
to the Stingers before the PCL playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Judging by the way they have played since their call-ups, don't
count on it.</LD>
<TE>   Callaway, who replaced the injured Aaron Sele in the starting
rotation, limited the Boston Red Sox to two earned runs over six
innings Sunday in his major league debut. Figgins, inserted into the
same game as a pinch-runner, scored the go-ahead run in the 8-3
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, we'll be playing here," said Callaway, scheduled to
start Friday at Edison Field against Baltimore--if the strike is
averted. "All I can do is get prepared to make my next start. If it
doesn't happen, it doesn't, and if it does, great. You can't get
frustrated with it."</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake could use both players if it qualifies for the playoffs.
Callaway went 9-2 with a 1.68 earned-run average  for Salt Lake,  and
Figgins set a single-season franchise record with 39 stolen bases.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Dennis Cook, recovering from a partially torn rotator
cuff, began his rehabilitation assignment at Class-A Rancho Cucamonga
on Tuesday. Cook pitched one inning, giving up a hit,  walking one
and striking out two.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said he hopes outfielder Tim Salmon
can get into a couple of games for Rancho Cucamonga before the
Quakes' season ends Sunday. Salmon, recovering from a bruised left
hand, has started strengthening exercises.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Orlando Palmeiro, who injured several ribs Monday when
he leaned into a wall while trying to make a catch, said he felt fine
but was not in the lineup Tuesday. Scioscia said he wanted to give
Palmeiro the day off while giving Alex Ochoa some playing time.</TE>

<LD>A radio station in Columbus, Ohio, plans to carry Michigan football
broadcasts, the Columbus Dispatch reports.</LD>
<LD>   Traitors? Try cutthroat competitors.</LD>
<LD>   "We're acting as a double agent for the Buckeye faithful, a secret
spy satellite audio for the many Buckeye fans, allowing unprecedented
insight into the enemy's planning," said WZNW program director Steve
Konrad, who called Michigan's game "the second-biggest game every
week."</LD>
<TE>   What WZNW appears to be trying is an end run around two local WBNS
stations' rights to the annual Michigan-Ohio State game.</TE>
<TE>   WBNS and the Big Ten office said they will look into the
legalities of whether a Michigan broadcast of the Ohio State game
infringes on the exclusive rights of WBNS to Ohio State games in the
Columbus area.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What year was the shortest strike in baseball
history, and how many days did it last?</TE>
<TE>   Old friends: Arizona Coach Lute Olson asked John Wooden to present
him at his induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame next month, but
Wooden has decided the cross-country trip would be too much.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I'd love to do it. I'm very fond of Lute Olson," Wooden
said. "[Hall of Fame officials] even said they'd send a private
plane. I'm just not up to it."</TE>
<TE>   The friendship between Wooden and Olson goes back many years.
Their late wives, Nellie Wooden and Bobbi Olson, were close as well.</TE>
<TE>   "My dear Nellie really liked the coaches who would bring their
wives to the convention," Wooden said.</TE>
<TE>   Olson won't be in Springfield, Mass., for the Sept. 28 induction
himself because of what you might call a prior engagement:</TE>
<TE>   His son, Greg, is getting married in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   "That's more important to Lute," Wooden said. "That's one of the
reasons I like him so much."</TE>
<TE>   Gatorade news: New York Liberty forward Sue Wicks, preparing for
the WNBA Finals against the Sparks beginning Thursday, recently
recounted her most embarrassing moment during a chat on WNBA.com.</TE>
<TE>   "One time I left Latrell Sprewell a good-luck note in his locker
before the playoffs, but I poured all my Gatorade all over his
uniform. I ruined his game uniform and they had to change it.... I
felt like I committed a crime!"</TE>
<TE>   Hardly--but P.J. Carlesimo might be amused.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The 1985 strike lasted two days, with no games
lost.</TE>
<TE>   Don't say a word: Bela Karolyi doesn't want to name any names when
he talks about the group of up-and-coming U.S. junior gymnasts that
includes Carly Patterson and Hollie Vise.</TE>
<TE>   He remembers how Vanessa Atler of Canyon Country was anointed the
next star long before the Sydney Olympics. But Karolyi left her off
the team after she struggled at the Olympic trials.</TE>
<TE>   "As you noticed, I did not say a name. I will not say a name. It's
very, very important," Karolyi said.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a sad experience, and one of the most frustrating
experiences of my coaching career was with Vanessa, burning her out
so easy and putting so much pressure on her. It came down to the
point she lost the self-control to live up to her incredible physical
talent she had at that time. I would not like to see that repeated."</TE>

<HD>Cora Out of Hospital and Lineup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alex Cora remembers Arizona shortstop Tony Womack coming across the
second base bag to field a throw from the catcher, and he remembers
lying face-first in the dirt, listening to Dodger trainer Matt Wilson
ask him questions.</LD>
<LD>   The 30-45 seconds in between are a blank. The Dodger shortstop has
no memory of Monday night's bone-jarring collision with Womack, the
result of Cora's head-first dive into Womack's right knee in the
ninth inning. He has no memory of his neck snapping back upon impact,
a blow that knocked Cora unconscious.</LD>
<LD>   But he does remember feeling a strange sense of calm, even while
his wife, Nildamarie, was so distraught she had to be physically
restrained from running out to her husband, and while a hush fell
over the Dodger Stadium crowd as Cora lay virtually motionless for 12
minutes before being taken away in an ambulance.</LD>
<TE>   "They told me not to move, but there was no panic, no fear," Cora
said. "They started asking me questions, and I knew where I was. They
touched me, and I felt everything."</TE>
<TE>   Cora was transported to Good Samaritan Hospital, where X-rays and
a CT scan were negative. Cora was diagnosed with what Dr. Michael
Mellman, team physician, called a "moderate" concussion, and he will
be sidelined for at least several days.</TE>
<TE>   But there was no serious neck injury, which came as a huge relief
to the Dodgers, who lost Monday night's game, 6-3, in 12 innings,
when the Diamondbacks rallied for three runs in the 12th off reliever
Guillermo Mota.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time in my life, I really didn't want to be on a
baseball field after that happened," catcher Paul Lo Duca said.
"[Cora] is one of my best friends, and to see him not moving for that
long, to see his wife ... that was pretty scary."</TE>
<TE>   Cora remained hospitalized overnight for tests and observation,
and he was released Tuesday morning. He was back in uniform Tuesday
afternoon and took early batting practice, but he did have a
headache.</TE>
<TE>   "He looks and sounds normal, but there's still lingering evidence
of the trauma he sustained," Mellman said. "There's a heaviness in
his head, the result of his brain swelling a bit. He just doesn't
feel right."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors will monitor Cora closely over the next few days, and when
he feels right, he'll resume running and lifting weights. Though Cora
expects to return this weekend, Mellman admitted Cora could be out
"for days, weeks, or months. You never know with a concussion."</TE>
<TE>   When Cora does return, he plans to heed the advice of his pregnant
wife.</TE>
<TE>   "She said to slide feet first from now on," Cora said. "No more
head-first dives. I'm going to slide. I'm going to try to be more
conscious of that."</TE>
<TE>   Cora said his injury was probably the result of "bad
base-running." After walking to open the ninth, Cora took a huge
secondary lead as Jolbert Cabrera squared to bunt. After Cabrera
missed, Cora felt he was as close to second base as he was to first,
so he took off for second and was out on Womack's tag.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the guys on television said I was trying to knock the ball
out of his glove--that wasn't the case," Cora said. "The shortstop
got there a little late, the throw was up the line, I was trying to
figure out how I was going to get to the bag. I had no room, so I
just jumped.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to protect myself, and [Womack] was trying to do the
same thing because he was right there. Thank God both of us are all
right."</TE>
<TE>   Womack hopped around in pain for a minute or two, but he remained
in the game and played Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost the feeling in my knee for a few minutes," Womack said.
"But when the other guy is not moving, you tend to forget what's
wrong with you."</TE>

<LD>   What: "Tales from the Diamondback Dugout"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Bob Page</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Sports Publishing, L.L.C.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $19.95</TE>
<TE>   Like an enticing Hollywood movie script, the 2001 baseball season
had it all: a beginning filled with hope, a middle stricken with
disaster, and an ending overflowing with triumph.</TE>
<TE>   A storybook finish to the season was just what America and its
baseball fans needed after the tragic events of Sept. 11. And at the
outset, who could have predicted that riding off into the sunset
wearing the World Series crown would be the 4-year-old Arizona
Diamondbacks?</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, baseball's infant franchise defeated baseball's hallmark
franchise, the three-time defending champion New York Yankees,
winning the Series dramatically--after trailing by one run in the
bottom of the ninth inning of the seventh game against baseball's
best closer, Mariano Rivera.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Page, a 28-year veteran of broadcasting and reporter for Fox
Sports Radio, examines the script for Arizona's stunning success in
his new book, "Tales from the Diamondback Dugout." In it, he covers
Arizona's march to baseball immortality, from spring training to the
World Series. Yet providing the most insight into this Cinderella
story are intangibles.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nobody immune to abuse [on this team]," center fielder
Steve Finley says. "Everybody's always gettin' ripped.... We get a
lot of good laughs, and that's what it's all about."</TE>
<TE>   The 181-page hard-cover book concludes with comments from
Diamondback players on what having won baseball's top team prize
means to them.</TE>
<TE>   "If I step off a curb tomorrow and get hit by a car ... I'll die a
happy man," veteran first baseman Mark Grace says. "Winning a ring is
so important. Now I've accomplished everything I ever wanted to do in
baseball."</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Roberts opens eighth with bunt single, and the
Dodgers rally for five runs in 6-1 victory over Arizona.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For seven innings Tuesday night, Arizona starter Miguel Batista
confounded and confused the Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   Then, in the eighth, Dodger leadoff man Dave Roberts disrupted
Batista.</LD>
<LD>   Roberts, who got things going with a bunt single before stealing
second base, ignited a five-run inning and the Dodgers beat the
Diamondbacks, 6-1, in front of 34,032 at Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   "I try to be a little pest out there," said Roberts, who had two
hits, scored two runs and stole two bases to run his season steal
total to 39, second in the National League.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, when I get on base, I can be enough of a distraction
and put enough pressure on that pitcher that he makes a bad pitch and
the batter can drive me in. Or I can take a base."</TE>
<TE>   How big was Roberts in the eighth? It was the most runs Arizona
had given up in an inning since July 21 and the Diamondbacks had not
given up four runs in a game since Aug. 4.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Manager Jim Tracy praised his first-year leadoff man.</TE>
<TE>   "What can you not say about this guy that isn't good? He's been an
invaluable piece that's been missing here, the catalyst," Tracy said
of Roberts, who joined the Dodgers as part of a three-player trade
with the Cleveland Indians on Dec. 20.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a guy that understands as a base runner when to go and when
not to go. He fuels a lot of positive things for this team. Not only
does he steal a lot of bases, he steals a lot of big bases."</TE>
<TE>   And not only did he jump-start things for the Dodgers on the base
paths, Roberts' fleet-of-foot fielding in center and decent arm cut
down a Diamondback go-ahead run in the fourth when he threw out Luis
Gonzalez at the plate to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone asked me the other day who the MVP of this team
is--[Eric] Gagne or [Shawn] Green," Tracy said. "I'd say Roberts is a
third candidate who makes that process much more difficult. The
Dodgers have not seen anyone like him since Brett Butler."</TE>
<TE>   With the win, the Dodgers (76-56) maintained their 2 1/2-game lead
over the San Francisco Giants, who beat Colorado, 7-4, for the
National League wild-card berth and are eight games behind the
defending World Series champion Diamondbacks (84-48) in the West.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger right-hander Paul Shuey (4-2) got the win with two innings
of perfect relief while Batista (7-8) took the loss. Until the
eighth, Batista had surrendered one run on four hits.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger starter Hideo Nomo, who had lost once in his previous 19
starts, going 10-1 with a 3.33 earned-run average, equaled a
season-high with 10 strikeouts in seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   It was the third time Nomo struck out 10 this year and the 31st
time in his career he had at least 10 strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   With Nomo out of the picture and not eligible for a decision,
Roberts dropped his bunt between Batista and Arizona first baseman
Erubiel Durazo with one out in the eighth. Roberts took off for
second on the first pitch thrown to Mark Grudzielanek, beating
Arizona catcher Chad Moeller's throw.</TE>
<TE>   After Grudzielanek struck out, Batista intentionally walked Green.
A shaken Batista then hit Adrian Beltre in the back with his first
pitch, sending Lo Duca to the plate with the bases loaded.</TE>
<TE>   On a 2-and-1 pitch, Lo Duca, who entered the game batting .201 in
the second half of the season, singled to right off Arizona second
baseman Junior Spivey's glove to score Roberts and Green, spelling
the end for Batista.</TE>
<TE>   It was the third straight Dodger win in which Lo Duca had the
game-winning RBI. .</TE>

<HD>Ishii to Give It a Rest</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after saying that struggling Kazuhisa Ishii, who will be
skipped in his next start, would not be moved to the bullpen in the
interim, Dodger Manager Jim Tracy reversed himself Tuesday--at least
for a game.</LD>
<LD>   "He's my long guy out of the 'pen for tonight," Tracy said.</LD>
<LD>   Ishii, meanwhile, who would not be needed as a fifth starter until
Tuesday, was taking his relegation in stride.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm just glad that they're giving me time to work things out by
myself and for my next start I can concentrate with my full effort
and have a good start," Ishii said through a translator.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii has been pounded in his last two starts, going 0-2 while
giving up eight earned runs in six innings--a 12.00 earned-run
average--seven hits (two home runs), five walks and six strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   In his last seven starts, Ishii's earned-run average has ballooned
from 3.31 to 4.33.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Ishii, who signed with the Dodgers as a free agent on Feb.
8 after 10 standout seasons in his native Japan, acknowledged that he
might be tiring from the grind of his first year in the major
leagues.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii, 28, has pitched 145 1/3 innings in 26 starts for the
Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   In Ishii's last five seasons in Japan he averaged 161 innings and
25 games for the Yakult Swallows.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I can say is that with a long season everyone is
tired to some extent," Ishii said of his recent shortcomings.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that has something to do with it but that's not the main
reason. Everyone at this point is having ... some fatigue and I think
it's only natural that it affects every player."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brian Jordan, on the disabled list because of a strained lower

<DL></DL>
<LD>Even though the Pacific Classic escaped Bob Baffert--and, by the way,
the start didn't get War Emblem beat on Sunday--the trainer has
another Del Mar training title within reach.</LD>
<LD>   With 13 days left, Baffert, who has led every meeting here since
1997, holds a 19-14 edge over Bill Spawr, who was Del Mar's top
trainer in 1994. Baffert has a chance to pad his advantage today with
four lively entrants in three races.</LD>
<LD>   In the first, a $45,000 starter allowance at six furlongs for
2-year-olds, the trainer will be represented by favorite and likely
winner Martinblestme. Owned by Dawn and Terry Henn, the son of
Benchmark overcame self-caused trouble to win his debut at Hollywood
Park on July 11, then finished fourth in a Graduation Stakes
dominated by stablemate Icecoldbeeratreds. He's facing much softer
competition today and should relish the extra distance.</LD>
<TE>   In the sixth, a $62,500 claimer for 3-year-olds at six furlongs,
Baffert will send out the uncoupled duo of Requesto and Chaos N
Confusion.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by the Thoroughbred Corp., Requesto, back in his own age
group after two consecutive races against older horses, is making his
first start in a claimer. Chaos N Confusion, owned by Mike Pegram,
will be making his first appearance since beating maidens by a length
last Dec. 26 at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in the seventh, a $60,000 allowance at one mile on the
turf, Baffert will saddle Tradition Rocks, a promising 3-year-old son
of Spinning World. He was impressive beating maidens in his second
start on the grass for owners Pam and Marty Wygod.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Reciprocate, a $575,000 purchase by owners Bob
and Beverly Lewis last summer, will make his debut for trainer Wayne
Lukas in today's sixth at Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Linda Rice. The trainer has won with six of her first
16 starters at Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Norberto Arroyo Jr. The former apprentice sensation has
struggled at Saratoga, having won with only two of his first 52
mounts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Fax Blitz in the
fourth, using Jink Williams, Gamblin Caper, Fringe Comment and
Cruisenrightalong in the fifth, and Requesto, Chaos N Confusion and
Red Vintage in the sixth.</TE>

<KH>MUNICH OLYMPICS: 30 YEARS LATER</KH>
<HD>Taking a Tumble</HD>
<DH>Olga Korbut has struggled in life since dazzling world with
innovative gymnastic routines</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Her smile is the same, illuminating her face and stirring memories of
the enchanting girl she once was.</LD>
<LD>   Certainly, Olga Korbut has changed in 30 years. She wears heavy
makeup, carefully applied, and tinted rectangular glasses. Her blond
hair is brushed to the side, too short to bunch into the plucky
pigtails she used to wear.</LD>
<LD>   But when she talks about the 1972 Munich Olympics, it's easy to
forget she's sitting cross-legged on the floor of a shabby but
ambitious gym tucked between a post office and a Walgreens in a strip
mall. Banished are thoughts of her recent woes, which include a
shoplifting arrest in Georgia--she avoided prosecution by paying $333
and completing a course on values--and her son's arrest on
counterfeiting charges.</LD>
<TE>   In this unlikely place emerges the spirit of the 4-foot-11,
85-pound sprite who daringly dived off the uneven bars, pranced on
the four-inch-wide balance beam and cavorted through her floor
exercise routine "like a little kid playing in the sun," in the
picturesque description of ABC commentator Jim McKay. At 47, with
some unkind years behind her, she still has that glorious grin.</TE>
<TE>   "Because it wasn't fake," she said. "I didn't change."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not, but the world has.</TE>
<TE>   With athletes from the former Soviet Union routinely playing
alongside Americans in professional sports, it seems a lifetime ago
that ideological barriers separated East and West politically and
athletically. Unlike boisterous Americans, Eastern European athletes,
taught from childhood to put the good of the team ahead of individual
gratification, were serious and robotic.</TE>
<TE>   Korbut, from the town of Grodno in what is now Belarus, didn't
conform. Defying officials who were horrified by her dangerous tricks
and predicted she'd never go far, she performed innovative moves and
instinctively played to the crowd. She was 17 but childlike and
irresistible in her innocence, transcending politics and borders.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what I thanks God I have and had, this gift," said
Korbut, who moved to the U.S. in 1991 and became a citizen in 2000.
"I didn't pay attention to [politics].</TE>
<TE>   "Why would the world fall in love with me? Because I was smiling
from my heart. I was crying from my heart. I never paid attention to
anything and I just focused on my work, on what I have to give. I
don't perform for the judges or to win. I always compete for the
public. If one seat will be empty, I will be disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   Cathy Rigby, the top U.S. gymnast and a medal hopeful at Munich,
noticed Korbut at the 1970 World Championships in Yugoslavia and
marveled at her courage and skill.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember thinking she was incredible, very impressive, really a
tiny ragamuffin girl doing flips on the beam," Rigby said. "Olga
always seemed to not fit the mold of the real subservient,
stone-faced athlete. She would ask questions. She was quick to smile
and she enjoyed the media and understood what to do.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that made her great and charming and wonderful was that
kind of spirit of the compulsive risk-taker. She did some incredible
things."</TE>
<TE>   Most remarkable was Korbut's openness. She exulted at Munich when
she and the Soviet women won the team gold medal, and she sobbed into
her blue team jacket after she stubbed her feet during her uneven
bars routine and fell out of contention for the individual all-around
title. Although she lost, she won hearts all over the world.</TE>
<TE>   "She had great flexibility and courage and was really fearless,"
said Paul Ziert, publisher of International Gymnast magazine. "And
she had that certain something that captivated people, and she was
able to show that each time, not just when she missed the bars and
cried, which hadn't been seen from a Soviet."</TE>
<TE>   She went to Munich an unknown outside the gymnastics world. She
left as an icon, having won three gold medals and a silver, and
having changed gymnastics forever. In 1976 at Montreal, she won team
gold and silver on the balance beam, but was surpassed by another
tiny dynamo, Nadia Comaneci of Romania. Munich was Korbut's personal
playground.</TE>
<TE>   "Olga Korbut was a darling because she was pixie-like, child-like,
yet she was an amazing and highly trained athlete for many years,"
said John Lucas, a retired Penn State professor and Olympic
historian. "She was the first girl-woman gymnast. Previous to that,
all the Eastern bloc gymnasts were tall, statuesque gymnasts who were
fully mature women rather than pixie girls. They were ballet trained.
She was athletics trained. Therefore, her performance was startling."</TE>
<TE>   Said Gordon Maddux, a rookie ABC analyst at Munich, "She was a
blight or a bright star, depending on how you looked at it. It had
been women's gymnastics, but after Olga, it became girls' gymnastics.
Until then, the athletes had been very elegant, very mature. They
replaced that with a battle of danger, a challenge to see who could
do more difficult tricks."</TE>
<TE>   Besides launching a worldwide gymnastics boom, Korbut helped thaw
icy political relations between the Soviet Union and the United
States. Earlier in 1972, President Nixon and Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger had gone to Moscow to ease tension between the superpowers.
A temporary respite was all they could manage. Over five days in
August, Korbut did what veteran diplomats could not.</TE>
<TE>   Invited to meet Nixon after the Games, she declined because she
had to practice for an exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew the president would not care if I fall from the equipment
but the public, they will say, 'Huh, you're a big star, you didn't
work enough,' " she said. Persuaded to meet him, she thoroughly
charmed that most vociferous Cold Warrior.</TE>
<TE>   "The [Soviet] ambassador told me after we met, 'You did for just
one visit with the president what we didn't do for five years,' " she
said. "I was really proud of that."</TE>
<TE>   Once her fame faded, the woman who'd charmed foreign leaders
wasn't allowed out of the Soviet Union for nearly 11 years. After
moving to the United States because she feared fallout from the
Chernobyl nuclear disaster might affect her family, her marriage to
rock musician Leonid Bortkevich fell apart. Demanding as a coach and
unable to inspire in her students the fervor she felt, she had
trouble keeping jobs.</TE>
<TE>   She clearly hasn't lived happily ever after since Munich. But she
has had enough practice picking herself up after falls to believe
that this time, things will turn out better.</TE>
<TE>   "I will teach instructors who will be here. I will teach them how
to teach basics, and I will do it by myself and they will see," she
said. "My favorite is to teach gymnasts [whose level is] right before
the Olympic Games, to the highest level. I know this. I am feeling
this."</TE>
<TE>   As she speaks, Scottsdale Gymnastics and Cheerleading is empty,
although there's a poster of her in the window advertising her
arrival. Korbut and Alex Voinich, her husband and manager, moved from
Atlanta to Arizona this month and are still settling in. Arthur
Cooper, owner of the gym, invited her to teach at a camp in June and
was surprised when she decided to move there to work.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very honored," Cooper said. "Of all the choices she has,
Australia, California--Alex wants to go to Florida--we're very
honored to have her here for as long as we can make it .... This is
Olga Korbut, for heaven's sake."</TE>
<TE>   Voinich initially said Korbut was too busy to be interviewed but
relented after two months of e-mails and a nudge from Cooper.
However, when she briefly left the room, Voinich cautioned that any
"personal" or "wrong" question would be the last.</TE>
<TE>   No discussion, then, of her failed coaching ventures in New Jersey
and Atlanta, or the misdemeanor charge that she had shoplifted $19.35
worth of chocolate syrup, tea bags, figs and cheese from a grocery
store in Norcross, Ga., on January, 31. Or of authorities finding
$35,000 in counterfeit money in a home she had owned with her first
husband and was occupied by their son. Richard Bortkevich, 23, is in
federal custody in Atlanta awaiting sentencing after having been
arrested in July and pleading guilty to possession of counterfeit
money.</TE>
<TE>   Those indignities and her appearance on an episode of Fox's
"Celebrity Boxing" in May led gymnastics observers to surmise she's a
lost soul who needs money. Publisher Ziert believes she's coaching
"because that's all she has and she doesn't want to coach.... It's
very, very tragic."</TE>
<TE>   Maddux, the public-address announcer during her successful
post-Olympic tour of the U.S., said he was too horrified to watch her
"box" Darva Conger of "Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?"
infamy.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she's having a hard time making ends meet," Maddux said.
"She looks like she's 100 years old now."</TE>
<TE>   No, she insisted, she's fine. She and Voinich, a fellow
Belarussian whom she has known for 14 years, have all they need. They
bought a car. They're looking for a house. She truly wants to coach,
although she believes many kids in the United States have too much
and lack the focus and motivation she had.</TE>
<TE>   "You have enough if you have a place to stay, to buy food," she
said. "People don't need more. Why are we born? We need to enjoy our
lives every minute, and never think about the negative."</TE>
<TE>   Her son's legal problems, though, undoubtedly weigh on her. A
question about him made Voinich wary, but she answered frankly, if
sadly.</TE>
<TE>   "He's old enough to have his life," she said. "If he decided to
move here, welcome. Maybe he will have a business or something."</TE>
<TE>   Gymnastics, to Korbut, is more than a business. It's her life.
From the time of her earliest memories, she was a gymnast, although
she didn't call herself that.</TE>
<TE>   "I was born in gymnastics. I didn't think about anything else,"
she said. "I didn't know what 'gymnastics' means. What is that? I
never saw gymnastics before. I just felt it in my body. I would jump
from a tree or jump over the fence--this, to me, was gymnastics. So
when I came to the gym, I was ready. I was strong enough. I wasn't
flexible but my mental [approach] was ready."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the coach, Renald Knysh--whom she would later accuse of plying
her with drinks and sexually assaulting her--didn't immediately
accept her as a student.</TE>
<TE>   "I start to come by myself and watch him and how he was teaching,"
she said, "and after his class I stood in the gym alone and did
everything he taught to his gymnasts. After one year he came to me
and said, 'You want to try this with me?' I said, 'Sure.' "</TE>
<TE>   She quickly learned moves capitalizing on her flexibility and
tininess. Soviet gymnastics officials said some of her tricks were
too dangerous for women, but she wanted to advance the sport.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'This is my life, and if you won't let me do it, I will
go away from the gym, because this is what I want to represent,' "
she recalled. "This is my style. I showed them difficult was beauty.
But I see them go a different way."</TE>
<TE>   Just as the Munich Games were a coming-out party for Korbut, they
were meant to be the same for the city. Intent on erasing memories of
the grim, Nazi-dominated 1936 Berlin Games and creating a light
atmosphere that put world politics out of mind, organizers used light
colors and pastel decorations. Until the Israeli athletes were taken
hostage in Olympic village and killed on Sept. 5--after the
gymnastics had ended and Korbut had departed--she was the symbol of
the Games' new benevolence.</TE>
<TE>   Considered a supporting player behind the elegant Lyudmila
Tourischeva and the musical Tamara Lazakovich, Korbut made her
Olympic debut Aug. 27 in the team compulsory exercises, compiling the
fourth-highest score and leading the Soviets ahead of the East
Germans. The next night, in the team optional exercises, she started
a buzz with her charming floor exercise, for which she got a 9.75
(out of 10.0), and her back flip from the high bar on the uneven
bars. Her back somersault from a tuck position on the balance beam,
which she capped with a happy, grinning dismount, drew gasps of shock
and delight as she helped the Soviets win the gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in awe," Maddux said. "She was out of the blue. She wasn't
the greatest talent, but she was terrifically theatrical, and her
coach, Renald Knysh, decided to use that to wow the judges and play
to the audience. They just blew everybody away because no gymnast had
ever done that."</TE>
<TE>   Two nights later, in the individual all-around competition, Korbut
dazzled the crowd with a quick and bouncy routine in the floor
exercise and was in first place after the vault. But early in her
routine on the uneven bars, she stubbed her feet against the floor
while doing a basic move, causing a costly break in the flow. She
made another similar mistake and earned merely 7.50, dropping to
10th. When she sobbed on the sidelines, a global audience cried with
her.</TE>
<TE>   "It was baffling to the Russians that she was so warmly received,"
Olympic historian David Wallechinsky said. "She wasn't their leading
gymnast.... A lot of it had to do with timing. These were the first
Games that were extensively covered by TV. It was great drama, the
classic formula. The fact that Americans could fall in love with a
Russian athlete in the middle of the Cold War is the most amazing
thing of all."</TE>
<TE>   Korbut said she recalls sensations more than events.</TE>
<TE>   "The newspaper, the radio, all languages--I didn't know the
languages but I heard my name, 'Olga Korbut,' " she said. "Right
away, I started to get telegrams and letters, and I didn't know what
was going on. Everybody started to recognize me. I didn't know how to
deal with that because I wasn't ready for that. Overnight, I just
became a huge star."</TE>
<TE>   Her star reached its peak Aug. 31, the night champions were
determined on each apparatus. She finished fifth in the vault finals
and tied for second on the uneven bars, behind Karin Janz of East
Germany. The judges' decision didn't go over well with the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "People were throwing cushions on the floor," Maddux said.</TE>
<TE>   Her spectacular balance-beam routine won her an individual gold
medal, but it was a prelude to the floor exercise, the finale.
Confident and sharp, smiling all the while, she tumbled and rolled,
sweet but strong, to a golden ending.</TE>
<TE>   "I was last of all the Olympic Games gymnastics," she said. "I
felt [I was] in my small town, on the grass, just playing and
dancing. That's all. I will remember for all my life this moment."</TE>
<TE>   She returned to the Olympic stage in 1976 at Montreal, but she was
older, bigger, no longer the surprising little imp.</TE>
<TE>   And too many post-Munich tours had left her too little time to
develop new skills. Her life soon took a different turn, toward being
a wife and mother and coach, as it has taken another turn toward
Scottsdale.</TE>
<TE>   "It is like a different country," she said of moving from Atlanta
to the desert. "The cars are different, the cactus, the people are
different. They are very nice here. Very straight."</TE>
<TE>   To her, it hardly feels like 30 years have passed since Munich.</TE>
<TE>   "I always focus on work, always creating. Time is going too fast,"
she said. "For me, I need to do a lot and I don't have time to do
it."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if she were happy, she paused and smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah. I'm happy," she said. "I don't know who have so many of
what I had and have.</TE>
<TE>   "My life is extremely different and goes very fast. I do in one
day a lot. Maybe people don't imagine. For their whole life they
didn't do what I have had before. It has been very interesting."</TE>

<HD>Deal Is Reached on Drug Testing</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Dodger catcher Lo Duca, a union representative,
says both sides have agreed on issue. Commissioner expected to
directly join talks today for the first time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>As Commissioner Bud Selig was preparing Tuesday to leave Milwaukee on
his private plane today to participate in the final attempts to reach
a bargaining agreement and avoid baseball's ninth work stoppage in 30
years, negotiators for the players and owners removed one obstacle
when they reached what a union lawyer confirmed is a virtual
agreement on steroid testing.</LD>
<LD>   During three meetings in Major League Baseball's Park Ave. offices
and numerous phone conversations, they also continued what management
lawyer Rob Manfred described as largely conceptual discussions on the
critical issues of revenue sharing and payroll tax, while still
waiting for the union to respond to the owners' last offer on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   This is where Selig is expected to pick it up today, directly
participating in the talks for the first time with 1) only two full
days remaining before the union's Friday strike date and 2) the union
and others privately believing he needed to be present before a deal
could be finalized.</LD>
<TE>   Manfred reiterated Tuesday that his negotiating committee has full
authority to consummate an agreement on behalf of the 30 clubs and
that he has been in constant communication with Selig, but sources
say the union has been leery of making further concessions on the
tax/revenue sharing package without assurances from Selig that he can
get an agreement past a militant core of owners and ratified by 16 or
more of the 30 clubs, providing he is not tied to that militant core.</TE>
<TE>   The Major League constitution calls for majority approval of a new
bargaining agreement, but three-fourths (23 of 30) approval on
revenue sharing, which could be a problem if the seven or eight
militant owners conclude that the revenue parcel does not transfer
enough money to the low revenue clubs.</TE>
<TE>   The sides, of course, first have to get to an agreement, and union
counsel Gene Orza, reflecting, perhaps, on a history of mistrust,
said that, "It's always better for the commissioner to be part of the
negotiations."</TE>
<TE>   Reached in Milwaukee, Selig was reluctant to discuss his decision,
pointing out that he maintains faith in his negotiators, that many
chief executives never go to the table and that "I don't want to make
too much or too little" of it, but he added, "if we don't get an
agreement by Thursday night, we'll be on dangerous ground."</TE>
<TE>   He seemed to suggest that there would be no way on Friday morning
to still save that day's slate of games, although Manfred said he was
unaware of a Thursday night deadline and would have to discuss it
with the commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   Of Selig's arrival, Manfred said:</TE>
<TE>   "I think people's expectations in respect to his involvement in
this process are misguided. He is, after all, the CEO of baseball,
and it is the rare event in this country when a CEO of a major
corporation becomes directly involved in a labor negotiation. He's
been fully consulted and is fully on board with everything we've
done."</TE>
<TE>   Both Manfred and Orza agreed Tuesday that they still have time to
get an agreement, and a person familiar with the status of
negotiations said, "the deal is there if Bud and the hawks will let
them make it."</TE>
<TE>   Neither, however, would discuss the specifics of where they are on
revenue sharing and the tax, and there is no clear indication they
have bridged the financial or conceptual gaps.</TE>
<TE>   Nor would they discuss the steroid agreement (Manfred would only
say they have gotten closer), but Paul Lo Duca, the Dodger catcher
and union representative, told reporters in Los Angeles that the
union's conference call Tuesday made it clear that "the drug test
part of the deal is done. We agreed on that, and that's great."</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca said it was his understanding that players will be tested
once in spring training and once randomly during the season, that the
tests will cover steroids, cocaine and marijuana, and that there will
be both discipline and assistance programs built into the package. It
isn't clear whether the plan hinges on a year or two of survey
testing first to determine the extent of steroid use, as the union
proposed, or whether it covers all four years of the potential
agreement, as management demanded and the union opposed.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca said the tone of Tuesday's union update was positive and
he came away thinking "they're getting close" to an agreement on all
fronts.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers still plan to travel to Houston for a weekend series
Thursday night, but several clubs said they are canceling Thursday
night travel and will wait until Friday to make a decision, which
seemed to support Selig's suggestion of a Thursday night deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Selig refused to characterize where the talks stand, but he told a
high ranking Fox executive that he was optimistic an agreement can be
reached.</TE>
<TE>   Will he try to facilitate it as part of his negotiating committee?
The union is curious to find out.</TE>

<KH>LABOR WATCH: 2 DAYS TO THE PLAYERS' STRIKE DATE</KH>
<HD>Reputations Are Riding on Outcome</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig arrives in New York today to join
labor talks that have turned so desperate, boxed in by Friday's
strike deadline, that the players union actually requested his
presence.</LD>
<LD>   But is Selig riding to the rescue, or riding in with a monkey
wrench?</LD>
<LD>   As a baseball season sits in the balance, with some teams already
revising travel plans in anticipation of a walkout Friday, it has
become clear that this latest impasse is about more than revenue
sharing and payroll taxes and player give-backs.</LD>
<TE>   This is about Selig, small-market owner and major league
commissioner, digging in and striking a blow for the little guys, his
long-standing kin, along with the big guys, who have grown desperate
trying to break out of a 30-year slump at the negotiating table.</TE>
<TE>   This is about Donald Fehr, the head of the Players Assn., who
learned his chops at the side of Marvin Miller, the Babe Ruth of
sports union leaders, and knows his mentor is still out there on the
sideline, watching and waiting to see what Fehr does with the back
end of a 30-year winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   This is about legacy and reputation and how the sports and
business writers of the future will look back on this sparring
session between longtime adversaries late in the summer of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   This is about history.</TE>
<TE>   Or, in the view of former baseball commissioner Fay Vincent,
possibly too much of it.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent, who preceded Selig and was forced out in 1992 after an
owners uprising spearheaded by Selig, said he believes there will be
a strike after Friday's deadline passes "because I don't think these
two guys can really make a deal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hard for them. They have a lot of history. People see
this as Selig's big negotiation--he controlled the negotiations for
25 years, he ran the [Player Relations Committee] for a long time and
never had any success whatsoever. I think it's going to be very hard,
in his eyes, to fail again."</TE>
<TE>   Fehr, on the other hand, is heading a team that has never known
anything but success. Baseball has had eight work stoppages since
1972, but after each of them, the players returned to the field
without having made a single major concession. The baseball players
union is riding one of the greatest dynasties in the history of
professional sports--and Fehr has been entrusted with preserving it
and nurturing it, even if the landscape is almost unrecognizable from
Miller's heyday in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this time it's much more complicated," Vincent said.
"Baseball is really sick, so for the first time, I think Fehr is
going to make really significant concessions. That might be perceived
by some as a loss--and I think that's the problem here. It's viewed
in terms of wins and losses and not in terms of a partnership.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to imagine Selig and Fehr sitting down and saying, 'We
have to trust each other, we have to work together, we've got to
build this for baseball. The two of us have to do something
discontinuous and very smart.'</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't going to happen. There's too much history and they
don't trust each other."</TE>
<TE>   Selig and Fehr go back 25 years, to 1977, when Miller hired Fehr
as general counsel for the Players Assn. and Selig was an eager
overachiever within the ranks of baseball ownership. Once considered
a hero in Milwaukee for airlifting the Brewers out of Seattle to
replace the already-departed Braves, Selig enjoyed that buzz, but
found it fleeting. He wanted more, so he threw himself into
good-for-the-game projects that included heading the Player Relations
Committee, which meant many long hours staring across a table at
Fehr, who replaced Miller as executive director of the union in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   The climb continued into the early 1990s, when Selig, believing
Vincent as commissioner was too conciliatory to the players, lobbied
his fellow owners for a no-confidence vote and finally got it in
September 1992, leading to Vincent's resignation. Selig replaced
Vincent as "acting commissioner," an interim gig that lasted nearly
six years--including the 232-day strike of 1994-95--until he was
elected "permanent commissioner" in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   From there, the reputations of Selig and Fehr went their separate
ways. While Fehr could count his successes as tangibly as his
constituents counted their millions, Selig flailed about as if he had
a public-relations death wish: announcing his plans to eliminate
several teams within days of the most exciting World Series in years,
being mocked by Gov. Jesse Ventura in front of Congress, getting
booed at home in Milwaukee after calling off a tied All-Star game
when both teams ran out of pitchers in the 11th inning.</TE>
<TE>   Heading into these latest negotiations, Fehr versus Selig was
billed in the media as a marquee mismatch: the class valedictorian
against the class clown. If Selig had grown tired of hearing it,
this, at last, was his chance to do something about it.</TE>
<TE>   Selig knows he will make his legacy with these negotiations. And
legacy, in Miller's estimation, is a major concern of Selig's.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I think so," Miller said. "This type of man, definitely ... I
think that between the two, there's no doubt in my mind that Bud
Selig is the more neurotic one about this. Don is far more of a
realist than Bud has ever shown."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball writer and historian Leonard Koppett says a victory, or a
public perception of a victory, is important "emotionally and
psychologically" for the owners in general and Selig in particular.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, he's a human being," Koppett said of Selig. "I'm certain he
would rather be admired than castigated. There's no question about
that.</TE>
<TE>   "In my judgment, much of the criticism made of him is unfair. He
makes a bad public impression, that's true. But that's neither here
nor there. The fact is, he isn't making decisions that determine
what's going to happen. He's reflecting the decisions of his side,
which is what he's supposed to do. The commissioner is the employee
of the owners.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite honorably, he's supposed to be putting forth and expressing
to the public what the 'owners' position' is, or should be. So to
make a monster of him is wrong. And even more so to make a monster
out of Fehr, who is even more scrupulous about doing what his
constituency wants done. His constituency obviously has a lot more
confidence in him than the owners as a group have in Selig.</TE>
<TE>   "Selig is an inappropriate commissioner because he's a club owner
himself. That tarnishes his position. But [the owners] did that with
their eyes open."</TE>
<TE>   If Selig is driven by the underdog fantasy of rallying a perennial
loser to an unlikely victory, Fehr has been charged with the role of
bullpen closer. Handed a big lead, he has been told to protect it at
all costs, even if the ballpark dimensions are nowhere near as
friendly as they were when Miller had the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Of the two assignments, Fehr's could be the most difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Don does feel some pressure to uphold the Miller
standard," broadcaster Bob Costas said. "I think part of that
pressure is because Don by and large believes the same things--and
also because Miller never had to concede anything. Now it's apparent
that Fehr is going to have to concede something in this case.</TE>
<TE>   "The enlightened view of that isn't that Fehr would have failed if
he has to concede something. It's only stubborn ideologues who would
view it that way. He could certainly be a statesman if he steps
forward with a plan that wouldn't be just fair to the players but
would help improve the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Players Assn. people are generally smarter than the
owners. They could probably come up with a better plan. If the
measure of success and the measure of enlightened leadership is never
giving anything back, then [Fehr] is going to lose. But if the
measure is striking a fair deal under the circumstances, he's got a
good chance to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Costas said he doesn't believe Fehr "cares about his place in
history from a personal standpoint. He's not a guy who thrives on the
spotlight, I think. Ideologically, however, he believes that the
players' positions, as they were set forth in the '60s, '70s and
'80s, are unassailable. And to concede on any of them isn't just a
practical business decision, it's an abdication of principle.</TE>
<TE>   "And that makes it very difficult to make a business deal."</TE>
<TE>   Miller says he talks "once or twice a week" with Fehr. Now 85 and
nearing the end of his second decade of retirement, Miller still has
an active role as sounding board and advisor for Fehr. And, on
occasion, he will publicly criticize Fehr for making what he
considered an unnecessary concession to the owners.</TE>
<TE>   How does he assess Fehr's performance during this negotiation?</TE>
<TE>   "From the outside, it looks like he has done his best to
negotiate, to give some ground, even though I don't think he believes
that there's any merit whatsoever to the owner issues," Miller said.
"Nevertheless, he's giving them more than the benefit of the doubt,
he's moved along and made some concessions and we'll see."</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend seemed to crystallize the Selig-Fehr stalemate, when
both sides spoke as if an agreement was imminent, only to wind up
scheduling dueling conference calls with the media after the union
proposed gradually phasing in increased revenue sharing over the next
four years.</TE>
<TE>   With no less than a minor victory in hand, Selig pushed for more
and wound up with nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Having made enough concessions for what appeared to be a
reasonable agreement, Fehr succumbed to either second thoughts or
second-guessing and beat a hasty retreat.</TE>
<TE>   "[Selig] said before this started he wanted his blue-ribbon
committee report to be implemented," Vincent said. "Well, there's not
a chance in the world that's going to happen. But I think at least
before the pullback--that is, before the union said they wanted to
phase in the revenue-sharing over four, five years--up until then, I
thought Bud had a deal that was pretty attractive.</TE>
<TE>   "I said it was about 30% of what he hoped to get, but 30% that
nobody else has had. It was a significant set of concessions, I
thought. Now it's changed. And it changes every day."</TE>
<TE>   So there they stand as the strike deadline approaches, Selig and
Fehr, polarized by philosophies and constituencies.</TE>
<TE>   And, quite possibly, paralyzed by legacy and history.</TE>

<LD>   Mark Spitz won only two gold medals in the 1968 Summer Olympics,
both in relays. Projected to win as many as six, his performance
there was considered a disappointment. But Spitz, from Carmichael,
signaled that Munich would be different on the first day of swimming

anchoring in the 400-freestyle relay.</LD>

to win in women's three-meter springboard diving. She had finished
fourth in Mexico City after breaking her arm on the next-to-last
dive. The Soviet Union, led by Lyudmila Tourischeva and upstart Olga
Korbut, won the women's gymnastics team gold medal.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Wang Zhizhi will not play for China in the World Championships at
Indianapolis because his national federation wanted him to commit to
playing in the Asian championships too.</LD>
<LD>   Simon Chan, a U.S.-based advisor to Wang, said Tuesday there will
not be a reconciliation agreeable to both sides.</LD>
<LD>   In Oakland last week, Wang was told by a Chinese Basketball Assn.
official that he could rejoin the national team if he signed a
contract promising to play for China at the Asian championships in
early October.</LD>
<TE>   Such a commitment would conflict with the opening of NBA training
camps.</TE>
<TE>   "He's at a point in his career where he wants a full training camp
before beginning his third NBA season," Chan said.</TE>
<TE>   Wang, a 7-foot-1 center who played for the Dallas Mavericks last
season, is a free agent.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reggie Miller is questionable for Thursday's opening game of the

George Karl said a decision on Miller likely would be made before the

<TE>   Philadelphia 76er forward Derrick Coleman is out until at least
November because of chronic knee problems. General Manager Billy King
said Coleman's left knee is healing more slowly than expected after
June surgery. The 35-year-old Coleman played much of last season with
knee pain. To help with depth at forward, Philadelphia signed former
Clipper Brian Skinner to a one-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   Motor Racing</TE>
<TE>   Former Indy Racing League champion Greg Ray won't drive for A.J.
Foyt in the last two IRL races of this season.</TE>
<TE>   Ray has been released from his Foyt Racing contract for the rest
of this season. Foyt's spokeswoman, Anne Fornoro, said that Foyt had
agreed to Ray's request to be released from his contract so he could
pursue other opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Jacques Villeneuve has turned down a three-year, $50-million deal
to race one season in CART before returning to Formula One.</TE>
<TE>   Villeneuve was offered by Player's Forsythe and British American
Racing to run one season in the CART series and two others in Formula
One, Le Journal de Montreal reported.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Jenny Thompson won the women's 50-meter freestyle, and
fellow American and Olympic champion Tom Malchow won the 200
backstroke in the Pan Pacific swimming championships at Yokohama,
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson clocked 25.13 seconds to win her event. Malchow won his
event in a meet championship record 1 minute 55.21 seconds, upsetting
teammate and world-record holder Michael Phelps, who finished second.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA guard Michelle Greco has been granted another year of
eligibility by the Pacific 10 Conference. Greco, a fifth-year senior,
was not allowed to play for the Bruins after Dec. 1 because of a
history of concussions. Greco still requires a medical clearance for
full participation with the team, including full contact drills when
practice starts.</TE>
<TE>   Baylor senior guard Wendell Greenleaf, a two-year starter, has
been dismissed from the team after being arrested twice on assault
charges.</TE>

<LD>Running back Jamal Anderson won't be part of the New England
Patriots' immediate plans, after all.</LD>
<LD>   A day after Anderson's agent said a deal was all but done, Coach
Bill Belichick said Anderson won't be on the roster.</LD>
<LD>   Belichick refused to get into specifics about the decision, but
said of the oft-injured back, "I don't quite think he was ready.
Maybe it will change, and maybe it won't."</LD>
<TE>   Belichick said Anderson, 29, agreed with his decision.</TE>
<TE>   "He took the physical, and after watching him and talking to him,
we both felt this was the right thing to do at this time," Belichick
said.</TE>

<TE>   Ki-Jana Carter was cut by the Green Bay Packers, perhaps ending
his injury-plagued career.</TE>
<TE>   Carter, drafted No. 1 overall by the Cincinnati Bengals in 1995,
never challenged for the Packers' backup tailback job behind starter
Ahman Green.</TE>
<TE>   The Packers also cut 11-year veteran kicker Louie Aguiar, who
played in Green Bay in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 49er backup quarterback Cade McNown needs surgery on
his left shoulder and will miss the season.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Terry Donahue said that McNown will have the
operation in the next few weeks and will be placed on injured
reserve.</TE>
<TE>   The injury to the shoulder first occurred two years ago, when
McNown was the Chicago Bears' starter.</TE>
<TE>   McNown, the 12th pick in the 1999 draft from UCLA, started 15
games in Chicago, throwing 16 touchdown passes and 19 interceptions.</TE>

<TE>   Carolina Panther safety Jarrod Cooper pleaded no contest to
drunken driving in connection with a one-vehicle accident in
February.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper was given a 90-day suspended jail sentence and put on
unsupervised probation for a year. The judge also fined him $800 and
ordered him to surrender his driver's license for a year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Seattle Seahawks signed veteran offensive tackle Jerry Wunsch
to a one-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-6, 339-pound Wunsch will immediately become the
Seahawks' starting right tackle. Wunsch reportedly signed a one-year
contract for $750,000 that included a $200,000 signing bonus. He was
scheduled to make $1.05 million with Tampa Bay this season, but was
released Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland Brown quarterback Tim Couch bruised his right forearm
during Monday night's loss to the Green Bay Packers.</TE>
<TE>   The club initially said X-rays were negative and that Couch had
strained his elbow. However, after the game, Couch said he strained
his forearm.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got a bruise of his forearm and with him it's going to be
day-to-day," Coach Butch Davis said of Couch.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, with all these guys we're going to err on the side of
caution."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Jet strong safety Sam Garnes, signed as a free agent in
the off-season, broke his thumb during practice.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Garnes nor any of the coaches were certain when the injury
occurred. Garnes will not play in Friday night's exhibition finale
against Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo Bill guard Jerry Ostroski, unable to fully recover from
knee surgery, announced his retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Ostroski, who was entering his ninth season and had been the
longest serving member of the Bills, had spent training camp on the
physically unable to perform list recovering from knee surgery.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Robinson, the long snapper signed to solve one of the Dallas
Cowboys' biggest problems, was put on injured reserve.</TE>
<TE>   The move means Robinson, who got a $4.8-million, four-year
contract from the Cowboys, won't play this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wide receiver Patrick Jeffers, slowed the last two years because
of knee injuries, was released by the Carolina Panthers.... The

<HD>Three More Homers for Bonds in Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Francisco Manager Dusty Baker is no longer surprised at Barry
Bonds' impressive feats.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds homered three times Tuesday night, including the
third-longest home run at Coors Field, a 492-foot first-inning drive,
as the Giants defeated the Colorado Rockies, 7-4.</LD>
<LD>   "You are past amazed. You accept it," Baker said. "When you see
greatness you don't really get amazed after a while."</LD>
<TE>   It was the fourth three-homer game of Bonds' career and gave him
38 homers this year and 605 in his career.</TE>
<TE>   "At this stage of my game there's no personal records that are
really that important to me," Bonds said. "You don't really want to
think about certain things because they may not end up the way you
want it all the time."</TE>
<TE>   With a chance to tie the major league record for homers in a game,
Bonds doubled against Todd Jones (1-4) in San Francisco's three-run
ninth, hitting a flare to left field.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds finished four for four to increase his NL-leading batting
average to .366 as he seeks the first batting title of his career.
Bonds increased his lead over Larry Walker, who is batting .357.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 5-0, St. Louis 4-5--Chuck Finley gave up only two
singles by Juan Castro as he pitched his first shutout in four years,
leading the Cardinals to a doubleheader split with the Reds at
Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Rolen hit a three-run homer in the first, and Finley took it
from there as the NL Central leaders ended a four-game losing streak.
Finley (5-3) retired the first 16 batters before Castro lined a
single to center.</TE>
<TE>   In the first game, Rolen made an errant throw home, fueling a
five-run second inning, and the Reds used five pitchers to close out
the win.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 11, Houston 6--Ryan Klesko hit the eighth grand slam of
his career and matched his all-time best with six RBIs to lead the
Padres at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Nevin had four hits and drove in two runs, including an RBI
single in a seven-run seventh inning. Klesko's grand slam capped the
big inning, giving him six RBIs in a game against Houston for the
second time in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 6, Milwaukee 2--Alan Benes pitched 5 1/3 shutout innings
in his first major league start since last September, helping the
Cubs win at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Benes, 30, had made only one major league start since 1997,
beating the Dodgers, 6-5, last Sept. 8. He had been sidelined by two
shoulder operations. He was at triple-A Iowa until he was brought up
Friday, going 10-9 with a 5.65 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 5, Pittsburgh 4--Matt Franco drove in four runs with a
homer and bases-loaded triple that broke a seventh-inning tie at
Pittsburgh, and the Braves withstood the Pirates' three-run rally.
John Smoltz got his major league-high 46th save.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 4, Montreal 2--Joe Roa pitched six strong innings at
Philadelphia and went two for two with his first two RBIs of his
career as the Phillies defeated the Expos for their sixth consecutive
victory.</TE>
<TE>   New York 10, Florida 5--Mo Vaughn hit a three-run homer and John
Thomson (8-11) earned his first victory with the Mets, pitching into
the ninth inning to defeat the Marlins at Miami.</TE>

<HD>USOC Narrows Field to Two</HD>
<DH>Olympics: New York, San Francisco chosen as U.S. candidates
for 2012 Summer Games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>New York and San Francisco were chosen Tuesday as the two U.S.
candidates remaining in contention as host city for the 2012 Summer
Olympics, a U.S. Olympic Committee task force dismissing Washington
and Houston in what was diplomatically termed a close vote but
reflected a common-sense view of political and cultural realities.</LD>
<LD>   The USOC's 123-member board of directors will choose between New
York and San Francisco on Nov. 3. That city will then be the sole
U.S. candidate for the 2012 Games, the next possibility for the
Olympics to return to the United States. The 2004 Summer Games will
be in Athens, the 2008 Games in Beijing. In between, the 2006 Winter
Games will be staged in Turin, Italy.</LD>
<LD>   The United States has played host to eight Games, four in the last
22 years, including the Winter Games last February in Salt Lake City.
Those 2002 Winter Olympics were a resounding success but the odds of
the European-dominated International Olympic Committee returning to
the United States in 2012 are long. The IOC will pick the 2012 site
in 2005. Paris, Rome, Moscow and a dozen other cities around the
world have expressed interest.</LD>
<TE>   The odds of another California Olympics--despite vivid memories
within the IOC of the spectacular 1984 Games in Los Angeles--are even
longer, Olympic insiders have said. San Francisco Games would be the
fourth in Olympic history in California. The 1932 Summer Games were
in Los Angeles and the 1960 Winter Games were held in Squaw Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC is due to pick the site of the 2010 Winter Games next
year, and Vancouver is widely believed to be the front-runner--a
choice that would make returning to the West Coast just two years
later problematic. The IOC prefers a geographical rotation in
awarding the Games.</TE>
<TE>   It is due today at a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, to trim the
list of eight cities that have applied for the 2010 Winter Games.
Vancouver's primary rival is likely to be Salzburg, Austria.</TE>
<TE>   Exulted upon still being in the race, Anne Cribbs, the chief
executive officer of the San Francisco 2012 bid committee, expressed
confidence Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge ahead is to communicate to the USOC board of
directors why San Francisco is their best choice," she said. "It's
pretty simple. And pretty hard."</TE>
<TE>   The Games have never been held in New York City. It has for months
been the city generating the most interest within the IOC.</TE>
<TE>   "We think New York represents everything great about America," New
York bid chief Dan Doctoroff said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether New York or San Francisco, it will take extraordinary
salesmanship for the U.S. candidate to win--as a series of incidents
this past week underscored. Though dollars from U.S. corporations
underwrite the Olympic movement's finances, political clout is
elsewhere, in Europe, Latin America and Asia.</TE>
<TE>   In voting over the weekend, for instance, Rio de Janeiro was
awarded the 2007 Pan-Am Games over San Antonio. On Monday, Sergei
Bubka of Ukraine, the former world champion in the pole vault, was
picked as the new chairman of the IOC's athletes' commission,
defeating Bob Ctvrtlik of Newport Beach, the former volleyball star.</TE>
<TE>   Today in Lausanne, the IOC's ruling executive board will hear an
internal report that recommends that softball, among other sports, be
dropped from the Olympic program. Headquarters of the world softball
federation are in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Don Porter, who heads the softball federation, said that dropping
softball would not only be a blow against female participation in the
Games--Olympic softball is for women only--but "another example of
U.S. bashing."</TE>
<TE>   Last October, the USOC trimmed a list of eight applicants to four,
cutting Los Angeles and three others.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, the task force toured New York, San Francisco,
Washington and Houston, grading each.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the selection of New York and San Francisco in a
meeting at the O'Hare Hilton, turned, as task force Chairman Charles
H. Moore had predicted it would, on "international strategic appeal."
Moore said the choice of those two cities was "not unanimous" but
reflected a "clear consensus."</TE>
<TE>   Houston was seen to lack international identity, and too often--to
the complaints of Houston officials--was compared with Atlanta. In
the IOC, the 1996 Games are recalled mostly for technology and
transportation problems and a murderous bomb explosion at a downtown
Atlanta park.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's bid revolved around a renovated waterfront and a
central Olympic park in the area around RFK Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Washington, however, projects American imperialism and power to
many within the IOC. And many delegates retain sharp memories of
former IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch being summoned to testify
before Congress in the midst of the Salt Lake corruption scandal.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco, meantime, with plans for venues spread around the
Bay Area, made the cut only after California Gov. Gray Davis put in a
recent telephone call that assured the USOC the state would assume
financial responsibility--up to $250 million--should San Francisco
win the Games and the organizing committee suffer a fiscal shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   That prospect seems highly unlikely, since the San Francisco plan
projects a budget surplus of roughly $400 million and, as well, calls
for a $250-million private investment fund.Nonetheless, without the
governor's call, the San Francisco bid would have been dead. Davis
could not be reached Tuesday for comment.</TE>
<TE>   New York's bid calls for construction of an Olympic stadium on the
city's West Side and of an Olympic village across town, near UN
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Last September's terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center,
Moore said, played no role in Tuesday's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the attacks, the mayor of Rome suggested that,
should New York emerge as the U.S. candidate for 2012, all other
contenders ought to drop out, as a message of solidarity. IOC
President Jacques Rogge called the suggestion premature.</TE>
<TE>   Doctoroff also sought to play down the uncertain impact of the
attacks on the bid process. But he said, "Obviously we're very
optimistic."</TE>

<HD>Olympic Changes Possible</HD>
<DH>Games: Softball could be among several sports to be
replaced and ice hockey could go on without NHL players.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON and HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>The International Olympic Committee's ruling executive board will
hear a report today that calls for the elimination of some sports on
the Olympic program, including softball, and their possible
replacement by other sports.</LD>
<LD>   Meantime, the new president of the winter Olympic sports
federation dropped an unmistakable signal that the Olympic ice hockey
tournament at the next Winter Games--in Turin, Italy, in 2006--may
not include NHL players.</LD>
<LD>   The IOC program has been the focus of study in recent months by an
internal committee. Some within the IOC are known, for instance, to
be intrigued by the prospect of including the world's best golfers at
the Games.</LD>
<TE>   Baseball, softball, modern pentathlon and triathlon have each been
under pressure in recent months. With the exception of softball, it
was not clear late Tuesday which of those sports, if any, might be
targeted. Influential IOC member Franco Carraro of Italy, who heads
the internal study commission, could not be reached late Tuesday for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Don Porter, president of the International Softball Federation,
confirmed that softball is on the IOC's list. He said in a telephone
interview that he was "totally devastated," adding, "It took us 30
years to get on the program. Now they want to throw us out?"</TE>
<TE>   Any decision would take effect, at the soonest, at the 2008 Games
in Beijing. Softball was first contested at the Games in Atlanta in
1996; the U.S. team won gold in Atlanta and in Sydney in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic softball is played exclusively by women, and the IOC has
shown significant interest in recent years in increasing the
percentage of female athletes at the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Dot Richardson, a star on both U.S. teams, said, "Fast-pitch
softball is an avenue where women can stand between the lines and
show the gifts God has given them in athletics. Just to even think
that the talk is going on is so disappointing, and outrageous."</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, Rene Fasel, head of the International Ice Hockey
Federation and newly elected chief of the association of winter
Olympic sports, said the 2006 Turin Winter Olympics would "have a
great tournament anyway" should the NHL and NHL Players Assn. decide
against participating in the hockey competition.</TE>
<TE>   The NHL suspended play to allow players to represent their
homelands in the 1998 Nagano Games and again last February at the
Salt Lake City Games. Both experiences produced mixed results. The
league and players received beneficial international exposure, but
some owners objected to the mid-season break and the prolongation of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   NHL spokesman Frank Brown said the league has made no commitment
regarding players' participation in the 2006 Olympics and said no
decision is likely until the NHL and the union reach a new collective
bargaining agreement. The current agreement expires Sept. 15, 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Abrahamson reported from Chicago, Elliott from Los Angeles.</TE>

<TE>   "The fans have been great, and I do apologize," he said. "I'm not
greedy. I don't want the fans to perceive me that way ... these fans,
they've been on a roller coaster for a while, and I can understand
their frustration."</TE>
<TE>   He continued.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I've been brass the last couple of days, said some things
that I probably should not have said," he said. "My frustration has
cumulated to where my play on the field has not been the way I like
to play."</TE>
<TE>   Imagine that.</TE>
<TE>   A player admitting that he may have been wrong. A player
acknowledging the fans' unhappiness. A player confessing that
Friday's pending strike has affected his batting average.</TE>
<TE>   As if that's not enough, get this:</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, correctly worried that Lo Duca was forever tarnishing
his image with his militant stand, had subtly suggested that he chill
out.</TE>
<TE>   So Lo Duca wisely chilled out.</TE>
<TE>   With this one small agreement between player and management so
easily reached, can a larger settlement be far behind?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I still have faith in the facts. I'm still convinced that, when
push comes to picket, major leaguers are just too street smart to be
hoodwinked by a union that no longer acts in its best interests.</TE>
<TE>   I still think there will be no strike.</TE>
<TE>   Just as they forced Donald Fehr's slick hand on the issue of
steroids, forcing the union to agree to a testing policy that was
finalized Tuesday, I think the veterans will back him down on the
other issues.</TE>
<TE>   They will realize that they are risking their careers strictly to
satisfy Fehr's desire to be right.</TE>
<TE>   They will understand that instead of fighting for something as
noble as working conditions or benefits, they are fighting for
something as shallow as victory.</TE>
<TE>   They will comprehend that they would return from this strike as a
much weaker union, if even the same union.</TE>
<TE>   They will tell Fehr to sign the stupid deal, and that will be
that.</TE>
<TE>   Indications are everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   A journeyman named Todd Pratt was popping off in Philadelphia,
recognizing correctly that the union does not speak for those players
who are not set for life.</TE>
<TE>   A smart guy named Tom Glavine said he was "optimistic that we're
going to get something done."</TE>
<TE>   Then, Tuesday, with everyone crowded around Lo Duca expecting him
to threaten and rip as he did earlier this week, he morphed from hawk
to dove.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think 30 owners want to strike," he said. "I don't think
the players want to strike."</TE>
<TE>   Wait a minute.</TE>
<TE>   Was this the same guy who, earlier this week, said, "It's getting
to be a joke.... They think we're bluffing, but we're not"?</TE>
<TE>   Didn't he also say, "If you've ever heard [Fehr] talking to Bud
Selig, it's like a college graduate to a kindergartener"?</TE>
<TE>   And wasn't that him barking that, "It's getting to the point now
where we've given a lot. When are they going to give something?"</TE>
<TE>   In only his second full major league season, he was becoming Norma
Rae Lo Duca, which works only if you are working in a sweatshop.</TE>
<TE>   With some of the Dodger fans coming to the games directly from
such sweatshops, it does not work here.</TE>
<TE>   He began getting booed. He continued struggling.</TE>
<TE>   His batting average, which has suffered the worst dip of any major
leaguer since the All-Star break--.326 before, .201 since--kept
falling.</TE>
<TE>   So the Dodgers reportedly sidled up to him and, probably while
looking the other way, whispered a two-word piece of advice.</TE>
<TE>   Brett Butler.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I've heard that name a couple of times lately," Lo Duca
said with a grin.</TE>
<TE>   You remember Brett Butler.</TE>
<TE>   Wonderful little player a decade ago, great leadoff hitter,
successfully battled throat cancer ...</TE>
<TE>   And still probably best known for his militant union stand in 1994
against replacement player Mike Busch.</TE>
<TE>   When Busch joined the team in August of that season, after showing
up in spring training when the players were on strike, Butler led the
move to ostracize him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a scab, pure and simple," Butler said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   At that precise moment, the constant booing of Butler began.</TE>
<TE>   For all those looking to vent their frustration over the current
state of the game, Butler gave them a face.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Lo Duca gave them the same face.</TE>
<TE>   Until Tuesday's about face.</TE>
<TE>   It was probably a coincidence that he later delivered the
game-winning hit Tuesday night. Or was it?</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged his comments earlier in the week were partly based
on understanding the fight of the average player, considering it took
him eight minor-league seasons and more than a dozen moves to reach
this point.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been through a lot of frustration to get here," he said,
referring to an eight-year minor league career filled with doubters.
"I'm sorry, but I don't trust anybody anymore."</TE>
<TE>   However, he said, "I'm happy. I'm not complaining. I'm just
thrilled to be here."</TE>
<TE>   Good thing somebody is. Here's hoping it's contagious, and quick.</TE>

<HD>Williams Sisters Can Serve as Big Inspiration to Others</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Venus Williams was uncomfortable with the questions about Althea
Gibson.</LD>
<LD>   "I've never actually met her," Williams said. "I've only seen a
couple of plays of hers on video. She seemed very, very smooth and
elegant as a player."</LD>
<LD>   Williams was also uncomfortable addressing the idea that she and
her sister, Serena, should be Pied Piper leaders of young
African-American girls into a sport that has not always welcomed
players of their race.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think the next Czechoslovakian player is vying to make
sure that other Czechs are in the game," Venus said. "It's the same
for me. Even though I'm African American, I'm living my life every
day, basically as a person."</TE>
<TE>   The subject of Gibson was brought up because Gibson, the first
African American to win Wimbledon and U.S. Open titles, was honored
Tuesday night at the Open, a celebration of her recent 75th birthday.
Gibson, who lives in New Jersey, is physically frail but mentally
strong.</TE>
<TE>   She watches every stroke of women's tournaments with interest,
says her friend, Fran Gray, but does not feel physically capable of
traveling to the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   While Gibson was winning Grand Slam titles in the late 1950s,
there was no influx of minority children into the sport.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not a surprise," says Gray, the coordinator of the Althea
Gibson Foundation. "We couldn't see Althea on television. We didn't
see her highlights on sports shows.</TE>
<TE>   "And there were no courts or rackets or balls in the inner cities.
There were no coaches. There was no support."</TE>
<TE>   While the inner cities aren't overflowing with tennis courts, they
do exist. So do programs and coaching for kids of every race.</TE>
<TE>   But there is no certainty that tennis will soon be a multi-racial
game.</TE>
<TE>   Venus made a good point. She and Serena took the same path as
other tennis stars but it is not a path that is a blueprint for
African Americans everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   She and Serena became champions because their parents, Richard and
Oracene, made a conscious decision to make their two youngest
daughters into tennis stars. Richard single mindedly shepherded his
girls into the sport because, he has said, there was big money to be
made.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Peter Graf gave Steffi a sawed-off racket, just as Karolj
Seles made tennis games for young Monica, just as Gloria Connors
changed her life so that Jimmy could be a star, Richard Williams has
managed the careers of his children.</TE>
<TE>   The video we saw of Gibson on Tuesday night was grainy and in
black and white. It featured a tall, strong African American woman
who stood head and shoulders above her opponents, who moved with a
dancer's ease across a tennis court and who hit the ball with a
fastballer's firepower.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Tuesday, Venus took 50 minutes to beat Mirjana Lucic, 6-0,
6-0. Williams is a tall, strong African American woman who stands
head and shoulders above her opponents, who moves with a dancer's
ease across a tennis court, who hits the ball with a fastballer's
firepower.</TE>
<TE>   Venus has won four Grand Slam titles and her sister three. They
have been paid millions of dollars from clothing and shoe companies.
They represent various companies. They have moved tennis into a new
realm of athletic performance.</TE>
<TE>   They are young and hip and cause a sensation with the clothes they
wear, with the powerful confidence of their strokes, with their
personalities, with their words.</TE>
<TE>   Their drawing power does not attract other African American women
to the game. Their drawing power attracts other young women.</TE>
<TE>   Gibson never expected to be a racial trailblazer, her friend Gray
says. Gibson hoped that by her success in sports she would be able to
convey a message about education, to advertise that she, a high
school dropout, earned a college degree.</TE>
<TE>   Chanda Rubin, another African American female tennis player, said
that if Gibson were playing today, "she would be rich. She'd be like
Stan Smith. She would have a shoe named after her and she wouldn't
have to work another day in her life."</TE>
<TE>   "Althea was a pioneer," Rubin said. "The Williamses have followed
in her footsteps as other black girls will follow in theirs. Kids
need access, opportunity, discipline, desire, good coaching, good
equipment. But it does start with a dream and that dream often starts
by seeing someone who looks like you out there succeeding."</TE>
<TE>   A dream will often remain a dream, though, unless the dreamer sees
a legitimate way to fulfillment.</TE>
<TE>   Lots of African American, Asian, Caucasian and Latino young men
and women would love to be Tiger Woods.</TE>
<TE>   But without an Earl Woods, a totally focused father, following in
Tiger's footsteps simply won't happen.</TE>
<TE>   Just because other girls and boys in Compton, where the Williams
sisters started playing tennis, might want to become Venus and
Serena, doesn't mean they will.</TE>
<TE>   Not without a Richard and Oracene to push.</TE>
<TE>   The way tennis is run in this country, as a sport of individuals
who must find their own way to the tennis court, to the tennis
lessons, to the junior tournaments, who must either have the money to
do all this or a singular parent to force all this, Venus and Serena
will be no more racial trailblazers than Althea Gibson was.</TE>
<TE>   Which isn't a good thing or a bad thing. It's just the way it is.</TE>

<HD>Rigby Helped Change Balance of Power</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before Olga Korbut dazzled the world at the 1972 Munich Olympics,
another pigtailed pixie introduced U.S. audiences to the power and
beauty of gymnastics.</LD>
<LD>   Cathy Rigby, who grew up in Los Alamitos, was the youngest member
of the 1968 U.S. Olympic team at 15. She placed 16th in the
all-around competition, the best finish by a U.S. woman to that
point, and in 1970 became the first female U.S. gymnast to win an
individual medal at the World Championships when she won silver on
the balance beam.</LD>
<LD>   Although she didn't win a medal at Munich--she was 10th in the
all-around and the U.S. women's team finished a best-ever
fourth--Rigby put in place the foundation for the gymnastics boom
triggered by Korbut.</LD>
<TE>   "I think I pioneered it," she said recently. "Being the first to
do something is an accomplishment people remember, and there were
only three TV networks, so a lot of people would watch [gymnastics]
every weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really thrilled with how it all turned out."</TE>
<TE>   An active child, Rigby tried gymnastics at a Lakewood gym and knew
she had found her niche. Under the guidance of Bud Marquette of the
Southern California Acro Team (SCATS), Rigby progressed rapidly and
made the U.S. team for the 1968 Mexico City Games, winning acclaim if
not a medal.</TE>
<TE>   After her success at the 1970 World Championships, she was touted
as a potential medalist at Munich. She fell short, but she doesn't
consider it a disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "Not at all," she said. "We all hit our rotations. And there's the
political side of a subjective sport like gymnastics, if you're one
of the countries considered a contender for medals on a consistent
basis, like Russia or Czechoslovakia. The U.S. wasn't considered one
of those countries then.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many variables--when you're up, the group you're in.
If you're in the second group, the judges need room to go up. They're
not going to give you a great score if you're up early because they
want to leave room in case someone has an incredible routine later.
We went up at 8 o'clock in the morning one day, right before the best
group went up. That's not sour grapes and that doesn't mean that's
why we didn't win a medal, but we were at a disadvantage.</TE>
<TE>   "The head judge was from Hungary, and Hungary was third and the
U.S. was fourth as a team. Your goal at the Olympics, I always felt,
is, 'I don't want to blow it. I can't control the scores but you can
do your best.' Everybody hit. To place in the top 10 in the world was
great."</TE>
<TE>   After Munich, Rigby became a TV commentator and worked diligently
to earn respect as an actress. She has become her generation's "Peter
Pan," having played the role more than 2,500 times on Broadway, where
she earned a Tony Award nomination, and in national and regional
productions. Rigby, who will be 50 in December, is also an advocate
for education about eating disorders. She endured a 12-year battle
with bulimia, during which she was hospitalized twice.</TE>

<HD>A Penguin at Third Base? No, That Has Been Done</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The wife just wrote out the first check, of what I am told will be
many, to start the wedding process for the daughter and the big lug
lying on my couch.</LD>
<LD>   As some of you know, the daughter was swept off her feet by a
Grocery Store Bagger: aisle five--pets and household items, I'm told.</LD>
<LD>   I have to acknowledge my three-year attempt to convince the
daughter I should remain the only man in her life resulted in a big
swing and a miss. It wasn't a total loss. I know what it feels like
now to be Marquis Grissom trying to hit a baseball.</LD>
<TE>   I'm told everyone involved in this extravaganza, which I guess
leaves me out, has selected a lovely reception hall for the Aug. 9th
wedding near the ocean in San Diego because it's more expensive
there. The daughter wants wedding pictures of her taken with the
Bagger with the water as a backdrop, which means shipping our couch
to San Diego because I can't imagine him ever getting off it.</TE>
<TE>   Now I've also seen the guest list for the wedding, and apparently
anyone with a Ralphs Club Card is invited. This is not good news for
many of you because I'll have to keep writing Page Two columns until
I'm 90 to pay for this thing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SO I was sitting in the Dodger Stadium press box Tuesday night
depressed, knowing I'll still be here in 2043 waiting for the Dodgers
to win their first playoff game since 1988, when I ran into Squiggy.
Only in L.A., baby.  It was three hours before game time and Squiggy,
you know, from "Laverne &amp; Shirley" fame, was sitting there staring at
the field like he couldn't believe they canceled his show 19 years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Now some people might also know actor David Lander as Henry the
penguin from the CBS cartoon, "Oswald," which makes Squiggy and Henry
immediately recognizable to people over 50 and under 5.</TE>
<TE>   "Oswald is a purple octopus," said the Bagger, and I guess the
penguin is also recognizable to big lugs who can't get off the couch
to change the channel.</TE>
<TE>   I told Squiggy about the daughter and the Bagger because my
alternative was to go down to the clubhouse and listen to the
millionaires grouse. Without hesitation Squiggy said: "My daughter
has a boyfriend, too. Pre-law. Some day he'll be an attorney."</TE>
<TE>   I never liked that guy on Laverne &amp; Shirley.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW I know there's no law against bad actors appearing in the
Dodger Stadium press box because Tom Lasorda is here most nights.
Remember those Slim-Fast commercials? But I'm a reporter, and I know
the players are about to go on strike, so right away I was wondering
if the Dodgers had started to assemble a replacement team--jumping on
the novel idea of starting a penguin at third base.</TE>
<TE>   Squiggy, however, is only a die-hard fan, who once gave the
Portland Beavers $25,000 so they could sign Luis Tiant. He said he
also worked two years for the Angels as a scout. The Angels hiring
Squiggy as a scout explains a lot.</TE>
<TE>   He has a pass giving him access to any press box in baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep score at every game I go to," he said. "I'm on my 79th
scoring book--25 pages to a book ... I'll be in Anaheim [tonight] for
the Angels' game."</TE>
<TE>   I found all that about as fascinating as reruns of "Laverne &amp;
Shirley." I noticed he was limping, though, when I told him to get
lost. He explained that was his "drop foot" from his Multiple
Sclerosis.</TE>
<TE>   I told him he could take his time while getting lost, because I
have a heart, you know, but he took that as an invite to tell me a
story.</TE>
<TE>   "I hid the fact I had M.S. for 15 years," he said. "Early in my
acting career they called me in and said I had problem. I thought
someone discovered I had M.S., and my career was over. But they told
me: 'We think you're an alcoholic,' and I said, 'Thank God.' "</TE>
<TE>   Squiggy speaks 30 times a year to audiences across the country on
behalf of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, taking in a game
whenever he can, and on occasion listens to sports writers whine
about lazy future son-in-laws.</TE>
<TE>   "Did I mention my daughter's boyfriend is going to be a lawyer?"
Squiggy said, which reminded me there's been no mention yet of a
pre-nuptial agreement. I'd like to see something in writing that says
I'm going to get my couch back.</TE>

<TE>   A WEEK ago some local high school all stars played in Dodger
Stadium, and only one ball was hit into the stands for a home
run--coming off the bat of Chad Tracy, Manager Jim Tracy's
17-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll tell you what's neat about that," the manager said. "He used
a wood bat for the first time and picked out the same exact model I
hit with when I played, and he had no idea that's the model I used."</TE>
<TE>   I watched Jim Tracy take batting practice before a game in San
Diego earlier this season. Chad, a power hitter, must take after his
mother.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BILL Thomson, chairman of the tenant search committee for the Rose
Bowl, said earlier this week the Rose Bowl would not accept the
Raiders--something to do with overcrowded conditions in the local
jail, I presume.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BOXING PROMOTER Bob Arum hit the Pick Four at Del Mar over the
weekend and collected $3,993.20. I'm still waiting to hear from Arum
which charity he intends to donate his winnings. I'd suggest M.S. in
the Grocery Store Bagger's name.</TE>

write about the Sparks ... again.''</TE>
<TE>   If you insist.</TE>
<TE>   T.J. Simers can be reached at t.j.simers@latimes.com</TE>
<TE>   The wife just wrote out the first check, of what I am told will be
many, to start the wedding process for the daughter and the big lug
lying on my couch.</TE>
<TE>   As some of you know, the daughter was swept off her feet by a
Grocery Store Bagger: aisle five--pets and household items, I'm told.</TE>
<TE>   I have to acknowledge my three-year attempt to convince the
daughter I should remain the only man in her life resulted in a big
swing and a miss. It wasn't a total loss. I know what it feels like
now to be Marquis Grissom trying to hit a baseball.</TE>
<TE>   I'm told everyone involved in this extravaganza, which I guess
leaves me out, has selected a lovely reception hall for the Aug. 9
wedding near the ocean in San Diego because it's more expensive
there. The daughter wants wedding pictures of her taken with the
Bagger with the water as a backdrop, which means shipping our couch
to San Diego because I can't imagine him ever getting off it.</TE>
<TE>   Now I've also seen the guest list for the wedding, and apparently
anyone with a Ralphs Club Card is invited. This is not good news for
many of you because I'll have to keep writing Page Two columns until
I'm 90 to pay for this thing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SO I was sitting in the Dodger Stadium press box Tuesday night
depressed, knowing I'll still be here in 2043 waiting for the Dodgers
to win their first playoff game since 1988, when I ran into Squiggy.
Only in L.A., baby.  It was three hours before game time and Squiggy,
you know, from "Laverne &amp; Shirley" fame, was sitting there staring at
the field like he couldn't believe they canceled his show 19 years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Now some people might also know actor David Lander as Henry the
penguin from the CBS cartoon, "Oswald," which makes Squiggy and Henry
immediately recognizable to people over 50 and under 5.</TE>
<TE>   "Oswald is a purple octopus," said the Bagger, and I guess the
penguin is also recognizable to big lugs who can't get off the couch
to change the channel.</TE>
<TE>   I told Squiggy about the daughter and the Bagger because my
alternative was to go down to the clubhouse and listen to the
millionaires grouse. Without hesitation Squiggy said: "My daughter
has a boyfriend too. Pre-law. Some day he'll be an attorney."</TE>
<TE>   I never liked that guy on Laverne &amp; Shirley.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW I know there's no law against bad actors appearing in the
Dodger Stadium press box because Tom Lasorda is here most nights.
Remember those Slim-Fast commercials? But I'm a reporter, and I know
the players are about to go on strike, so right away I was wondering
if the Dodgers had started to assemble a replacement team--jumping on
the novel idea of starting a penguin at third base.</TE>
<TE>   Squiggy, however, is only a die-hard fan, who once gave the
Portland Beavers $25,000 so they could sign Luis Tiant. He said he
also worked two years for the Angels as a scout. The Angels hiring
Squiggy as a scout explains a lot.</TE>
<TE>   He has a pass giving him access to any press box in baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep score at every game I go to," he said. "I'm on my 79th
scoring book--25 pages to a book ... I'll be in Anaheim [tonight] for
the Angels' game."</TE>
<TE>   I found all that about as fascinating as reruns of "Laverne &amp;
Shirley." I noticed he was limping, though, when I told him to get
lost. He explained that was his "drop foot" from his Multiple
Sclerosis.</TE>
<TE>   I told him he could take his time while getting lost, because I
have a heart, you know, but he took that as an invite to tell me a
story.</TE>
<TE>   "I hid the fact I had M.S. for 15 years," he said. "Early in my
acting career they called me in and said I had problem. I thought

<LD>Former winners Bayern Munich, Feyenoord, Inter Milan and Manchester
United reached the European Champions League Tuesday by winning their
final qualifying matches in emphatic fashion.</LD>
<LD>   In front of 40,000 in Munich, Germany, Bayern got goals from
Michael Ballack, Elber and Hasan Salihamidzic en route to a 3-1
victory over Partizan Belgrade of Yugoslavia. Bayern advanced, 6-1,
on aggregate, after beating Partizan, 3-0, in Belgrade two weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   Feyenoord of the Netherlands used goals by Shinji Ono and Thomas
Buffel to defeat Fenerbahce, 2-0, in Istanbul, Turkey, and went
through, 3-0 on aggregate, after a 1-0 victory two weeks ago.</LD>
<TE>   Inter Milan was in equally good form, disposing of Portugal's
Sporting Lisbon, 2-0, in front of 51,405 at San Siro, to go through,
2-0 on aggregate, after a 0-0 tie in Lisbon two weeks ago. Luigi Di
Bagio and Alvaro Recoba scored first-half goals.</TE>
<TE>   Manchester United lost its away game to Zalaegerszeg of Hungary,
1-0, two weeks ago in Budapest but rebounded with a 5-0 victory at
home Tuesday to reach the Champions League field of 32 with a 5-1
aggregate triumph.</TE>
<TE>   Playing in front of an Old Trafford crowd of 66,814, Manchester
built a 3-0 lead as Ruud Van Nistelrooy, David Beckham and Paul
Scholes scored. United wrapped it up in the second half with goals by
Van Nistelrooy on a penalty kick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</TE>
<TE>   The 32 Champions League teams will be divided into eight groups of
four for Thursday's first round.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chileans Go on Strike</TE>
<TE>   The players on Chile's 32 professional teams went on strike
Tuesday to protest unpaid salaries and to demand a greater say in the
administration of the sport. Chile's coaches held a separate meeting
in Santiago, after which they said they would support the players'
stance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USA Tops Italy</TE>
<TE>   The United States' under-20 national team defeated Italy, 2-1, on
goals by Eddie Johnson and Devin Barclay at XIX Torneo Internacional

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Break for Keller</TE>
<TE>   U.S. national team goalkeeper Kasey Keller, who unsuccessfully
battled Scotland national team goalkeeper Neil Sullivan for the
starting job at Tottenham Hotspur for most of last season, will be
keeping it for at least several months.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan broke his thumb during training Sunday and will be
sidelined for two months and possibly longer if surgery is needed,
the English Premier League team said.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Glenn Hoddle has started Keller in the first three games
this season and Keller has responded with two shutouts, including one
Tuesday night in a 1-0 win against Charlton.</TE>

<HD>Safin Really Earns Opener</HD>
<DH>U.S. Open: Exhausted Russian, seeded second, outlasts
cramping Kiefer in 41/2-hour match.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Not one, but two wheelchairs, were waiting in the corridors of Arthur
Ashe Stadium on Tuesday afternoon at the U.S. Open. So much for the
last man standing theory.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, there was this question: Would any man be standing after
Marat Safin of Russia and Nicolas Kiefer of Germany finished with one
another?</LD>
<LD>   Kiefer, his left calf cramping, went down on the court in a
fifth-set tiebreaker, writhing in pain. Trainer Bill Norris went to
assist, and a concerned Safin came over to see if Kiefer was going to
be able to stand. Even veteran tournament official Alan Mills walked
out, standing with Safin, who earlier needed medical assistance
himself.</LD>
<TE>   Amazingly, Kiefer stood. Awaiting him was match point, and it
wasn't his. He saved one when Safin hit a forehand return out, but
succumbed on the second.</TE>
<TE>   The players earned a fitting standing ovation, as the
second-seeded Safin won the 4 1/2-hour marathon, 6-3, 4-6, 4-6, 6-4,
7-6 (4), in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   Safin joked that he was hoping Kiefer would quit. "Yes, I was
praying for it," said Safin, who won here in 2000. "Because I
couldn't [play] anymore, and I just wanted to finish this match
because it was just terrible."</TE>
<TE>   With his typical honesty, Safin said he was "scared" in the
decisive tiebreaker and declared that he was "choking."</TE>
<TE>   "How I'm feeling? Dead. Completely dead," Safin said. "Completely
tired."</TE>
<TE>   Said Kiefer: "I had a bad feeling, but I wanted to stand up. I
wanted to finish the match. Then I made a point, I think, 'Wow, he's
getting nervous too.' "</TE>
<TE>   Sheer will got Kiefer back on his feet. Not many of the ailing men
could say the same after two unexpectedly injury-riddled days at the
Open. Through two days, and not even one round, seven men have
retired from their first-round matches because of injuries, tying a
Grand Slam record.</TE>
<TE>   One of the seven involved a painful-looking episode in the
first-round match between Mark Philippoussis of Australia and Sjeng
Schalken of the Netherlands. Philippoussis, a finalist here in 1998,
went up for an overhead, landed awkwardly and injured his left knee
in the fifth game of the fourth set.</TE>
<TE>   He continued for four more games but retired from the match and
was not available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The long Safin-Kiefer match delayed the proceedings on the Stadium
Court, making a long day longer for defending champions Lleyton
Hewitt of Australia and Venus Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sitting in the locker room watching everyone cramp," said
the top-seeded Hewitt, suffering from a cold.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt opened his title defense with a routine 6-2, 6-3, 6-3
victory over Frenchman Nicolas Coutelot. He saved his sharpest
retorts for the ATP Tour, which has fined him more than $100,000 for
not submitting to a prematch interview with cable network ESPN at the
Cincinnati tournament this month.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all one-sided coming out," Hewitt said. "It was all lies
coming out. So that was probably the most disappointing thing about
it. I felt the ATP was sort of riding the wave, as I said before,
there were so many guys just making up stories in there, just to
throw it in, I guess to save their job."</TE>
<TE>   The highly anticipated second-round match between No. 11 Andy
Roddick and Taylor Dent of Huntington Beach failed to materialize.
Though Roddick beat qualifier Martin Verkerk of the Netherlands, 7-6
(2), 6-3, 6-4, in the first round, Dent went out in five sets to
Raemon Sluiter of the Netherlands, 3-6, 6-3, 6-0, 1-6, 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   And so, it seemed as though the men would actually provide all the
drama on and off the court. The top women had little trouble. Venus
Williams, seeded second, defeated qualifier Mirjana Lucic of Croatia,
6-0, 6-0, in 50 minutes and No. 3 Jennifer Capriati defeated
17-year-old qualifier Bethanie Mattek, 6-0, 6-0, in 44 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Former champion Martina Hingis of Switzerland, playing her first
Grand Slam since the Australian Open in January, nearly went out
against Marissa Irvin of Santa Monica. The ninth-seeded Hingis, who
won, 6-3, 5-7, 6-4, squandered a 4-1 second-set lead.</TE>
<TE>   The tranquil day for the women ended when Capriati walked in the
interview room. Her pleasure at the easy victory evaporated when she
was asked questions about Richard Williams, the father and coach of
Venus and Serena. Capriati was asked about comments he made to Inside
Tennis, that she needed to quit cursing on the court and listen to
her father, Stefano.</TE>
<TE>   "I have nothing to say about what he says," Capriati said. "It's
just a waste of time. You can see how ignorant and how disrespectful
that sounds. He should just concentrate on his daughters and he's
doing a good job."</TE>
<TE>   But she had more to say.</TE>
<TE>   "And he gets away with it," Capriati said. "It's too bad. It's no
class. I've never said anything personal, just about the game itself.
I could say things about them, but I'm not going to because I'm not
going to lower myself to that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The fledgling Tennis Channel announced that it has secured the
broadcast rights to eight professional tournaments next year,
including the women's event at Manhattan Beach in the summer, and the
first will be the men's tour stop in San Jose in February.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Andre Agassi has become an investor in the venture.</TE>

<HD>Manning Jr. Is Arrested, Charged</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA senior cornerback Ricky Manning Jr. was arrested Tuesday night
and charged with felony assault with a deadly weapon stemming from an
April incident outside a Westwood bar.</LD>
<LD>   Manning, a two-time All-Pacific 10 Conference pick and the Bruins'
most charismatic leader, was in custody for three hours and released
on $60,000 bail at 9:15 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Bob Toledo said that Manning, 21, would remain with the team
and play pending the outcome of the legal process.</LD>
<TE>   According to Manning's attorney, Daniel Davis, Manning acted in
self-defense after he and friends were confronted by a group of men
inside Madison's Neighborhood Grill, a restaurant and bar popular
among students.</TE>
<TE>   "A number of individuals acted aggressively toward a friend of
Ricky's in the restaurant," Davis said. "The other party was sent out
of the restaurant. When Ricky and his friends came out, the other men
were waiting."</TE>
<TE>   The fight took place outside and resulted in undisclosed injuries.
Davis said the "deadly weapon" is Manning's fist and that Manning
suffered a hand injury.</TE>
<TE>   Manning is an NFL prospect who signed a $375,000 contract with the
Minnesota Twins in 1999. Davis said he has no criminal record.</TE>
<TE>   "The assailants were intoxicated and Ricky was not drinking,"
Davis said. "People sue and get money for it. I would daresay that in
the three months [since the incident] they've sobered up and are
pulling on the golden ring."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo said Manning informed him about the fight the next day.
Manning was disciplined and required to undergo anger management
counseling.</TE>
<TE>   Manning, who could not be reached for comment, believed the
incident was forgotten and that neither side had filed charges, Davis
said.</TE>
<TE>   Before his arrest Tuesday, Manning discussed his role as a team
leader. He is one of nine Bruins on an advisory council that is
charged with policing players' off-the-field behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "Football players are aggressive dudes and things happen when guys
go out in public," he said. "The young guys look up to me and other
seniors and they see from us what is OK and not OK. I'm not afraid to
say I'll be my brother's keeper."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo said that he believes Manning's version of events, that the
player was acting in self-defense. Davis said the other men were not
students and were older and bigger than the 5-foot-9, 180-pound
Manning and his friends.</TE>
<TE>   "Ricky is an outstanding young man and a leader on our team,"
Toledo said. "From what he has told us, he was not the aggressor in
the incident and attempted to avoid the confrontation. We stand
behind Ricky and have confidence in the legal system."</TE>
<TE>   Manning is the fourth Bruin player in the last two years involved
in a serious fight.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive end Asi Faoa, a junior, was charged with assault after
punching another student at a fraternity party in the spring of 2000.
Faoa pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges a year ago but has yet to
serve his 180-day sentence. He is scheduled to appear in court Sept.
11 to arrange for work furlough.</TE>
<TE>   Faoa settled a civil suit with the victim, agreeing to pay Rodrigo
DeZubiria $100,000 if Faoa plays in the NFL within three years after
leaving UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Audie Attar was dismissed from the team this summer
after punching the younger brother of former UCLA quarterback Scott
McEwan in the face at the Westwood Brewing Company.</TE>
<TE>   Attar, who transferred to Division I-AA Idaho State, had been
involved in other fights, including punching Bruin baseball player
Charles Merricks in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Also, C.J. Niusulu, a freshman defensive lineman, faces felony
battery charges stemming from a July 17 fight at a drive-in theater
in Barstow. The incident occurred a month before Niusulu reported to
UCLA, and he has practiced with the team.</TE>
<TE>   Niusulu, 18, was arraigned Tuesday and had his case continued
until Sept. 26, according to the Barstow District Attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo's policy has been to dismiss a player convicted of a felony
and to suspend a player convicted of a misdemeanor for one or two
games. Players have been allowed to suit up until their cases are
resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo said earlier Tuesday before Manning's arrest: "Football
players are big, strong athletes in the limelight. The unfortunate
thing is that guys out there constantly want to challenge these
[players] because of who they are and get them in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "Football players are by nature aggressive individuals. Because of
their makeup, sometimes they don't walk away. Some do, but some don't
back down, and that's wrong. So I have to discipline them, suspend
them."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo is not optimistic that he has seen the last fight involving
a Bruin player.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not over, it'll never end," he said.</TE>

<TE>   Freshman quarterback Matt Moore sprained his left knee while
dropping back to pass during a drill Tuesday and is questionable for
today's scrimmage at the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Moore already trailed freshman Drew Olson in the race to back up
starter Cory Paus and last weekend told his former coaches at Newhall
Hart High that he probably would redshirt.</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Craig Bragg, the team's most dangerous big-play threat,
is running at full speed after spending a week hobbled with hamstring
and knee pain. He will play in the scrimmage.</TE>

<LD>Sultan McCullough appears recovered from a hamstring injury and
Justin Fargas is making progress in his comeback from the same, but
Trojan Coach Pete Carroll said Tuesday that sixth-year senior
Malaefou MacKenzie will start at tailback in the opener against
Auburn on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "We didn't know who the top guy was coming in and we still don't,"
Carroll said. "Malaefou will start the game unless something changes
and that gives us great experience and leadership."</LD>
<LD>   MacKenzie suffered numerous injuries during his career and was
granted an extra year of eligibility by the NCAA after he missed last
season because of two knee sprains and the death of his father.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm excited, but it really doesn't matter who starts because
we're all going to rotate in," said MacKenzie, who has started four
games. "It's kind of ironic that I'm the only one healthy. It's been
weird."</TE>
<TE>   MacKenzie and McCullough, the team's leading rusher the last two
seasons, will probably play the most against Auburn. Sophomore Darryl
Poston and freshman Hershel Dennis also are expected to play, but
Fargas' status remains doubtful.</TE>
<TE>   The senior transfer from Michigan participated in most drills
Tuesday for the first time since Aug. 17 when he strained his right
hamstring before the team's first scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   If Fargas is not completely sound, Carroll said, he will not play
against Auburn.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just trying to get better every day and today was another
step," Fargas said. "It felt better and I'm going to keep working and
try to do more tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Offensive lineman Zach Wilson, who suffered a left foot strain on
the first day of training camp, did not return to practice as
anticipated and will probably miss the opener, Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Matua will start at right guard and become the first true
freshman to start an opener on the offensive line since Travis
Claridge in 1996. Redshirt sophomore Travis Watkins will back up
Matua.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior cornerback Marcell Allmond, cleared for contact drills
after recovering from a staph infection, said he is looking forward
to hitting today when the Trojans practice in full pads.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm definitely going to come out with a headhunting mentality,"
said Allmond, who is challenging senior Darrell Rideaux at right
cornerback. "We rotated the corners [Tuesday], which means to me that
they don't know who they want to play yet. That means everybody is in
the mix."</TE>

<HD>Stanton Ballot Still 'Fair,' Says Candidate</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>A Stanton City Council candidate Tuesday characterized a judge's
order deleting about 30% of his statement in the city's voter
pamphlet as a "victory" that will not hurt his campaign.</LD>
<LD>   "Only three of my nine major points were removed," Kevin F. Carr
said. "It was more than fair. My opponents lost big time."</LD>
<LD>   His comments came one day after Orange County Superior Court Judge
David A. Thompson ordered the material removed following a legal
challenge by Stanton Mayor Brian Donahue and council members David
Shawver and Harry Dotson. When Thompson's ruling was issued Monday,
Shawver also claimed victory.</LD>
<TE>   The incumbent councilmen and Carr, an Internet marketing
developer, are competing for three open seats in the Nov. 5 election.</TE>
<TE>   Among the statements ordered deleted were a negative comment
regarding the city's utility tax and a sentence contending that "our
city has been mismanaged so badly for so many years that the entire
city is now a rehabilitation zone and some are proud of that fact."</TE>
<TE>   The judge let stand, however, several statements, including one
claiming that Stanton's unemployment rate is one of the highest in
the nation, that businesses within its boundaries are closing and
that "we can't fix a problem if we won't admit there is one."</TE>
<TE>   Carr said Tuesday that he could live with the changes. "It's not
going to hurt me," he said. "The things that were taken out, the
residents already know. This was a victory for me."</TE>
