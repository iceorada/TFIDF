<HD>The Original Man in Black</HD>
<DH>Lew Wasserman's sleek look set the sartorial standard for
Hollywood agents</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With his oversized black-rimmed glasses, elegant dark suits and
pristine white shirts, the late Lew Wasserman came to personify
Hollywood power. Along the way, his look became an archetype for
legions of talent agents today.</LD>
<LD>   As the former chairman and chief executive of the Music Corp. of
America, Wasserman, who died Monday, not only created a way of doing
business but also inspired the unofficial dress code that governs the
way Hollywood agents look today. With his insistence on austere
attire in a business that was once more gaudy than genteel, he helped
improve the negative perception of talent agents as disreputable
cads.</LD>
<LD>   "When I became a talent agent for MCA, the word 'agent' was
synonymous with 'pimp,' " Wasserman once said. "Talent agents wore
green suits and hung around street corners with big cigars in their
mouths.... I wanted to change the image."</LD>
<TE>   The power of his image lingers over an industry that is well known
for its creative boundary-breaking, where lawyers, accountants and
even studio executives eschew business suits for crinkled khakis and
casual shirts. In virtually any meeting of Hollywood types today, the
person most likely to wear a suit is the agent.</TE>
<TE>   "Every CAA agent I've ever seen wears a suit, and the ICM agents
wear suits," said Marty Bauer, a former president of United Talent
Agency, who now operates the Bauer Co. management firm in Beverly
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the other large talent agencies, including UTA, Endeavor
and William Morris, are recognized by their sharp-dressing agents.
Many agents adhere to some variation on the dress code Wasserman
instilled in the late 1940s when MCA invaded Hollywood. The code
would be updated in the '80s by the ultra-stylish Giorgio Armani-clad
Michael Ovitz when he headed the Creative Artists Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Though even stodgy corporate America long ago relieved many
employees from having to wear suits, agents continue to embrace
traditional business attire whether they're at lunch, a hip night
spot or a movie premiere. "It's to maintain a degree of
professionalism," said Bauer, who credits Wasserman at MCA and others
at the William Morris agency for setting the standard. "Those two
made their people wear suits. In fact, they used to wear black suits.
That kind of custom has continued to maintain itself." As the
agencies traded employees, their traditions cross-pollinated, helping
to spread the gospel of the well-cut suit.</TE>
<TE>   Astute agents haven't forgotten Wasserman's sartorial
contributions to their craft.</TE>
<TE>   "In a business where people pride themselves on being creative and
distinct, it's important for the more business-minded people to dress
the part," said Marty Bowen, a 33-year-old agent at UTA. "Agents wear
suits so their clients don't have to."</TE>
<TE>   Across the gender line, the code rules: "I think the customary or
unwritten dress code is a business suit for a woman, as well," said
Carrie Stein, 42, an agent at ICM. "In the last few years, they have
become a little more creative for women, but for men, it's very
standard."</TE>
<TE>   Bowen chafes at the discomfort of neckties but learned as a young
agent to appreciate the meta-message. "When you're out there, you
have to be taken seriously. People are asking you to take control of
their career. In some ways, they want to see you as a buttoned-up
figure."</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman expertly synthesized his personality, his power and his
appearance into a package as sleek and commanding as the black glass
skyscraper that he built as chairman at Universal Studios. Like
others who reach icon status, Wasserman inherently understood the
details of the character he represented. The original MIB--man in
black--he was both mysterious and compelling but always correct in
his inky, traditionally cut suits that set off his controlled white
hair. He didn't have roots in the garment business like his studio
mogul predecessors Samuel Goldwyn, Adolph Zukor and Louis B. Mayer,
but as a fellow Jew, he understood what many generations of outsiders
learn about the value of good clothes: First impressions count, and
without the best attire, it's easy for the establishment to count you
out.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a certain sort of nattiness that defines you as a player
in Hollywood," said Wanda McDaniel, who from her executive post at
the Beverly Hills Giorgio Armani boutique has for years dressed the
power elite. Wasserman, however, was old school and knew to imitate
old money. For his suits, he choose the Chicago-made, $2,000-plus
Oxxford suits, said his longtime clothier John Carroll, owner of
Carroll &amp; Co. in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "Titans of industry wear Oxxford clothes," said Carroll, who
listed both presidents Bush as Oxxford acolytes. Whatever the
weather, he also wore black cashmere socks.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll saw Wasserman nearly every Saturday after the mogul had
his customary breakfast with his grandson Casey Wasserman, who is
president of his grandfather's foundation and owner of the L.A.
Avengers. "He was a very conservative dresser. I never saw him
unshaven. There was never a button undone. Seven days a week, he was
always very elegant."</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman also understood the ease and power of a signature look.
Virtually every fashion icon-- Jacqueline Onassis, Vogue editor Diana
Vreeland, designer Halston--dressed from a limited vocabulary of
items. Wasserman's black-and-white wardrobe was partly serendipitous;
it was the result of his wife, Edie's, attempt to end his mismatched
suits, according to author Dennis McDougal, who wrote in his 1998
Wasserman biography, "The Last Mogul," that the executive was
colorblind. And like the late fashion journalist Carrie Donovan, the
Chicago Cubs announcer Harry Caray, or uber agent Irving "Swifty"
Lazar, the most recognizable element of Wasserman's look was his big,
black glasses.</TE>
<TE>   "People would come to us and ask for the Wasserman look," said
Victor Duval, owner of Optics by Victor, a Beverly Hills shop near
Carroll &amp; Co. Though Wasserman wasn't a customer, the veteran
optician identified the famous, solid-black rims as the Goliath style
by German manufacturer Cazal. "They were a very powerful look," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Goliaths, which were similar in their thick blackness to wife
Edie's rims, are also symbolic of Wasserman's beginnings and his
lifelong commitment to eye research and vision science. In 1936, the
Cleveland-born Wasserman joined the Chicago-based MCA. Its
founder--and Wasserman's mentor--Jules Stein was a board-certified
ophthalmologist who gave up the practice to pursue music and build
MCA. At one of Wasserman's last public outings, the retired mogul was
honored for his substantial gift to build the $40-million Edie and
Lew Wasserman Eye Research Center building that will join the Jules
Stein Eye Institute at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Though he was noticeably frail at the gala to honor him last
October, he remained a commanding figure. Even as his huge glasses
dwarfed his face, they magnified his all-seeing eyes. Wasserman was
famous for never missing a detail and knowing its long-term
significance. He was, after all, a visionary.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It was almost impossible to navigate through the elbow-to-elbow crowd
clutching drinks and tapas in the small, low-ceilinged cantina on the
Raleigh Studio back lot in Hollywood. Guests leaned against the red
bricks and stucco of the Spanish-style walkways, balancing plates on
their arms while they talked about the film they had just
viewed--"ivansxtc."</LD>
<LD>   Most were incredulous that it had been made for so little--only
$136,000. Others were struck by the intensity of the plot. "Studios
have been afraid to do real drama like this," said one man. "Maybe
that will change now."</LD>
<LD>   Directed by Bernard Rose, the film tracks the tumultuous,
drug-fueled decline of a Hollywood agent, played by John Huston's son
Danny Huston, after he is diagnosed with a terminal illness.</LD>
<TE>   The story, conceived as an update of Tolstoy's "The Death of Ivan
Ilyich," was inspired in part by CAA uber-agent Jay Moloney, who was
fired from the agency in 1996 for alleged cocaine addiction; he
hanged himself in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   At the premiere's after-party Tuesday night, Huston collected
praise for his work. His sister Anjelica Huston played host,
escorting Kelly Lynch and a leather-clad Sheryl Crow to the bathroom,
and then sharing a drink with Billy Zane, who wore a gray fedora.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Salma Hayek gave exuberant congratulations to the
film's star. Between mouthfuls of tiny cubes of cheddar cheese, the
actress went on to talk about her latest project--she's soon heading
for Utah to direct a film called "The Maldonado Miracle" for
Showtime.</TE>
<TE>   (The movie, which she's also producing, is about small-town
residents who believe that the blood they see on a religious statue
is miraculous, when in fact it is from an injured Latino boy hiding
from the INS.)</TE>
<TE>   Once word filtered through the group about Hayek's plans, a friend
summoned a film crew member and asked him to sign on for the project.</TE>
<TE>   He smiled as though he'd be only too happy to follow Hayek
anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to shoot 14 scenes a day," she gasped. Her audience
nodded sympathetically while Hayek shook her black curls and called
out, "No. You don't understand!" Sounds like this one may be
interesting behind the scenes.</TE>
<TE>   Food for Thought</TE>
<TE>   "Our generation has to share," said 33-year-old Steven Arroyo,
sitting at the Hillmont, his new Hollywood Boulevard restaurant near
Los Feliz Village. Behind him, a glass sign spelled out his vision:
Super Communal. As in, sharing tables with strangers.</TE>
<TE>   Arroyo's been honing his restaurant visions since he was 25, when
he made the leap from selling Illy espresso machines to opening
Boxer, a small place on Beverly Boulevard soon touted by The Times'
magazine as one of the best in the city. None of his staff was over
30. "It made it more vibrant," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Boxer closed in May 2001, and two months later, Arroyo replaced it
with Cobras &amp; Matadors, which has a tapas menu and serves no liquor.
(Diners can bring beer or wine or buy it next door at Bicentennial
13, the Spanish wine shop he owns.)</TE>
<TE>   Arroyo has a stripped-down aesthetic. The Hillmont has exposed
brick walls and simple black-and-white family photos.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always had a tight budget, and it forced me to be more
creative," he said, adding that he gave up tablecloths because it
annoyed him when they were placed unevenly on the table.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be able to concentrate on the important things in
dining: What's on the plate, how you're greeted ... creating
something I can live with."</TE>
<TE>   So far, he said, his biggest challenge has been earning the
respect of food purveyors.</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, the restaurant business is "a very romantic way to
make a living."</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood is looking for the Next Guy. The guy they can tell,
'You've got the ball on the one-yard line and you gotta go 99 yards.'
Because the Old Guys are getting old. Like me."</TE>

<LD>AT THE JIM BRIDGER</LD>
<LD>   Stories</LD>
<LD>   by Ron Carlson</LD>
<TE>   Picador USA</TE>
<TE>   194 pages, $23</TE>
<TE>   Contemporary stories and novels about the American West have
developed certain conventions.</TE>
<TE>   There is a down-at-the-heels motel on a poor road at the edge of a
wind-worn town. Its manager, an aging man with a dubious past, sits
on a folding chair watching the flicker of the TV. Outside, a car
pulls up on the gravel. A couple comes in and rents a room. A plot
ensues. It unfolds and, in the end, flings the characters back into
the rootless past from which they blew in. Ron Carlson's nine stories
and two stream-of-consciousness bits in "At the Jim Bridger" contain
some of the conventions. There is a joint called the Blue Bird. There
is a motel in Arizona called the El Sol. There are characters whose
pasts are indistinct.</TE>
<TE>   But Carlson goes beyond the conventions to create characters who
in their strangeness become suddenly rich with life, their situations
lying just beyond the edges of commonplace existence.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Clicker at Tips," Eve is a third of the way through the
English beer menu when the narrator opens the big wooden door and
joins her. They talk, she getting tipsier and louder. The young men
in their blue blazers and pinstriped shirts want her to keep quiet so
they can watch "Monday Night Football." Eve and the narrator haven't
seen each other for two months, but she learns that he is, after all,
a friend, as he will prove at some cost to himself.</TE>
<TE>   In "At the El Sol," the narrator is on the lam, running from a
woman's sinister boyfriend and the minor swindle of a casino. He sits
on the patio and watches the people on a bare budget drive into the
little paved courtyard, the ranchers and roughnecks and runaways to
whom the motel is like a welcome oasis. He does odd jobs for Mr.
Cuppertino and becomes increasingly frightened that he will be
discovered by his pursuers. A surprising act of kindness saves him
and ennobles Mr. Cuppertino.</TE>
<TE>   "Gary Garrison's Wedding Vows" is, in its sweet, quiet way, just
about perfect, a story that in the 19th century way clicks neatly
shut like the lid on a metal box. Driven by feelings she can neither
decipher nor control, a young woman with the unlikely name of Gary
quits Radcliffe after her sophomore year and takes a job as a bird
counter at a wildlife refuge in northern Utah. The Canada geese
arouse her feelings, make her nerves tingle. She meets a man who
moves her, and then another man, and decides at the end of the season
to marry the second one. The little wedding congregation waits; the
call of the Canada geese will pronounce the marriage vows.</TE>
<TE>   In some of the stories, the chief character, observing from
outside like a writer, does not quite comprehend what is going on
around him. In "Towel Season," a mathematician wrapped up in his work
is bewildered by the way other people's towels accumulate around his
pool and house in the Arizona desert. In "The Ordinary Son," a
non-genius in a family of geniuses finally manages to find and keep
his footing.</TE>
<TE>   In this and two other stories about high school boys, Carlson
brings freshness to a hackneyed genre. In "Evil Eye Allen," two
teenagers concoct a manic magic act that propels the aloof and most
desirable high school girl into the arms of one of them. In "At
Copper View," a double date ends in an ordinary way that we know is
tragic.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the time in Carlson's tales, cheerfulness, and plain
personal resilience, keep breaking in. "The Potato Gun" is a fine,
funny and scary piece about families and how they raise their kids,
what the kids expect and how the families in their kind and fumbling
ways try to make it all fit together.</TE>
<TE>   Carlson's most ambitious story is the title piece. In its
complexity, it is really a novella. In the mountains at the Jim
Bridger Lodge, named for the mountain man and scout, a man who is
with a woman not his wife has told her of getting caught in a
blizzard on an earlier mountain trip, and how he and another man,
saving themselves in the storm, experienced an almost involuntary but
powerful erotic encounter with one another.</TE>
<TE>   Carlson tells that story with both delicacy and force. In fact,
this collection of stories about people in the uncertain moral
terrain of the American West consistently surprises and delights.</TE>

<HD>Eyes on the Size</HD>
<DH>Can another plus-size women's magazine succeed? Newcomer
Grace thinks so.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Ceslie Armstrong, the editor of newly launched Grace magazine, says
it's time for full-figured women to get the attention they deserve.
"It's a huge, huge, market," she said.</LD>
<LD>   Pun intended.</LD>
<LD>   "Nearly 70% of American women wear a size 12 or above, but we're
treated like we're invisible," Armstrong said in the magazine's 5th
Avenue offices. Armstrong, an elegant and unabashed size 16 herself,
wants to reinvent the way the fashion industry perceives the
country's plus-size market--the retail segment that is growing the
fastest but whose customers have the fewest choices.</LD>
<TE>   In the same way Martha Stewart exalted domesticity, Armstrong
hopes to help American women crave curves--or at least accept them.
Her previous attempt, Mode magazine, folded last September. At a time
when advertisers are holding budgets down, trying once again to
expand a nation's notion of beauty may be heavy lifting. Or it could
be a super-sized business opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Most magazines aimed at plus-size women have had a difficult time
staying in business; Extra Hip and Radiance are no longer publishing.
But the first such title, California-based BBW (Big Beautiful Woman),
founded in the late '70s, still publishes every other month following
a brief shutdown in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Grace magazine, for women "who live life to the
fullest," claimed space on newsstands between "get thin for summer"
issues of Glamour and Vogue. The cover features a "real" woman, a
cardiac surgery nurse who moonlights as size 12 model.</TE>
<TE>   Designed for women who are often stigmatized for their size, the
contents are forthright. The debut issue includes a spread on bathing
suits that actually fit, an article on sex with the lights on, an
arty sepia-toned nude portrait, and a humor column criticizing
Procter &amp; Gamble's new maxi-maxi-pad. Grace, like other women's
magazines, offers ample material for aspirations and fantasy. But
there are no mentions of diets or ways to firm abs--in fact, one
fashion spread features a model making cookies. A shoe layout plays
on two favorite indulgences: stilettos and strawberry tarts. For the
swimsuit shoot, the models were encouraged not to suck in, to show a
lot of thigh, reveal their tummies and revel in their curves. Instead
of starving themselves for a week before the shoot, they posed for
pictures for a while and then all sat down for a hearty lunch.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea was to have fun," said Armstrong. "It's about
celebrating the body, and being comfortable in your own skin. It's
also about striking a balance between extreme obesity and starving
malnutrition. Neither side is healthy."</TE>
<TE>   With the national economy in a downturn, it may seem like a risky
time to launch a magazine and a Web site (www.gracestyle.com). But
Grace is aimed smack at the middle of a growing national trend. While
retail sales have been flat for sizes 0 to 12, plus-size sales have
soared as much as 18% in the last two years. Retailers have begun to
respond to the growing demand for more realistic fashions, taking
plus-size wardrobes out of store basements and back racks and putting
them in prime space.</TE>
<TE>   Saks Fifth Avenue has devoted an entire floor since 1999 to Salon
Z, a department for sizes 14 to 24. "No other category has a whole
floor," said Michael Macko, Saks' director of publicity, "so that's a
big deal for us."</TE>
<TE>   While Liz Claiborne has had a plus-sized line--Elisabeth--for 10
years, and added a casual collection called Woman this spring, other
designers have only recently jumped on board. In the last few years,
Tommy Hilfiger, Anne Klein, Dana Buchman and DKNY have expanded their
ranges. Italian luxury clothier Max Mara has launched a new line
called Marina Rinaldi.</TE>
<TE>   But most fashion magazines, so narrowly focused on the cult of
thinness, have been nearly blind to the trend--and the potential
advertising dollars. While Vogue tiptoed into taboo territory in
April with its "Shape" issue, the only truly plus-sized model, size
14 Kate Dillon, was pictured as a giantess facing a diminutive
muscleman and a toy car. (All that was missing, wrote Slate critic
Emily Nussbaum, was the "freak-show calliope music.")</TE>
<TE>   Kate Betts, the former editor of Harper's Bazaar, understands all
too well the dynamic that keeps real women out of the pages of
fashion magazines. Though she was struggling with a postpartum weight
gain herself, she decided to pull Renee Zellweger off the cover after
the actress gained weight for her role in "Bridget Jones's Diary."
(Betts apologized for the decision in a thoughtful essay on body
image that ran in March in the New York Times.)</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard people commenting on the Vogue issue, saying 'I don't
buy Vogue to look at fat people,' said Betts. "And as harsh and
horrible a comment as that is, it is true. People buy Vogue for
fantasy, and one of the fantasies of women in our culture is to be
thin and young. So that's why I think it's smart for Grace to take
more of a lifestyle approach, to offer more than fashion and beauty."</TE>
<TE>   Grace fills a void left by Mode, a similarly targeted fashion
magazine that Armstrong helmed until it folded last year. Though the
4-year-old Mode was considered successful with a half-million strong
sales base, it still lost money.  The owner, Freedom Publications,
decided to sell it to focus on its trade magazines, but couldn't find
a buyer in the uncertain economic climate last fall.</TE>
<TE>   It closed in late September, around the same time as Conde Nast's
Mademoiselle. Soon after, an investor asked Armstrong to put together
a new magazine and to expand its focus to include food, travel, and
lifestyle. The deep pockets belong to Jane Siebels, who runs
Bahamas-based Green Cay Asset Management, a socially conscious
investment fund. Though she's not one to sacrifice return, her
interests are more than monetary. "A magazine like this is very
important because it promotes an image of real women and can do
social good, " Siebels said. "At the same time, it makes sense
financially. You have advertisers looking for a home, and there's no
competition for this demographic. I think there's a real need out
there."</TE>
<TE>   Though Armstrong intends to cater to a specific niche of the
market, readers and advertisers may resist being pigeonholed. "With
luck, they've learned from Mode's mistakes," said Samir Husni, the
head of University of Mississippi's magazine program. "There may be
many, many large women out there, but they don't necessarily want to
focus on that aspect of themselves. That's why there is not a
successful Divorce magazine. Grace may get a cult following, but I
believe they will have trouble attracting a mass readership."</TE>
<TE>   Retailer Lane Bryant, the plus-size industry leader, decided not
to advertise in Grace's spring and fall issues this year, booking
"mainstream" fashion magazines such as Vogue, Jane, and Glamour
instead. "We wanted to validate our customer and send the message
that she is equal to every other woman," said Greg Clark, Lane
Bryant's vice president of marketing. But Lane Bryant will sell the
magazines in its stores and may place ads next year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Grace is working for every ad dollar, but the magazine has
rejected advertisements that do not follow its philosophy--those that
tout weight-loss programs or that picture models who are too thin.</TE>
<TE>   "There was one with a size 2 girl in a bikini on a beach," said
Armstrong. "Not only would they waste their money with us, it would
alienate our readers. They were missing the message."</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong expects that like Mode, Grace's subscriptions will
largely outweigh newsstand sales, because, as one woman said as she
purchased Grace at a Grand Central Station newsstand two days after
its debut, "Who wants to be the fat girl buying the fat girl
magazine?" Most women's fashion magazines, for example, sell around
40% of copies on newsstands.</TE>
<TE>   Grace, which costs $3.99 on the newsstand and $18 for 10 issues,
has inherited a base of loyal and expectant readers left behind by
Mode, said Armstrong. The magazine also scored a marketing coup by
arranging distribution at Kmart and Wal-Mart and will do joint
marketing with Liz Claiborne and Macy's, among other companies. The
next issue comes out in September, and the magazine will be published
every other month next year.</TE>
<TE>   That will give Grace time to build its readership and work out the
kinks that have bedeviled its launch. Editors rolled out the magazine
just eight months after the first meeting, and the quick start-up
made tempers flare and detailed plans fray, according to a staff
member. Grace parted company with its PR agency just two weeks before
the launch, had to redo television shoots and embarrassed major
advertiser Liz Claiborne by misspelling its name--twice--in the
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   More seriously, Grace's logo is a near-exact replica of a
now-defunct magazine of the same name in New Zealand, and another
Grace exists in Tennessee. (See accompanying story, this page.)</TE>
<TE>   But many women are rooting for a magazine that reflects real
women. At a Macy's fashion show to promote its private-label line INC
Woman and the magazine, beauty consultant Kim Kitt-Cooper applauded
the models as they came off the stage. "We're not going to ever look
like Kate Moss, even if we wanted to," she said. "And now that there
are decent clothes for us, who cares about skinny?"</TE>
<TE>   On the runway, 26-year-old model Randi Graves strutted in black
and white capri pants and a fitted black top. The main difference
between her and a standard mannequin--besides her weight, height and
age--was that she had a million-dollar smile and looked genuinely
happy to be there.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people think I'm fat," the size-16 model said after the
show. "But I think my weight fits my face and my bone structure just
fine. I'm a grown woman now, and I like my curves."</TE>

<LD>   Grace magazine may be innovative in many ways, but not in its
logo. The masthead is a near-duplicate of a New Zealand women's
magazine, also called Grace. That publication, 49% owned by Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp., folded in December 2000 but still holds the New
Zealand trademark.</LD>
<LD>   Ceslie Armstrong, editor of the new U.S. magazine, said that she
and her designers had never seen the New Zealand periodical before
selecting their logo. She has applied for the trademark rights in the
U.S., and the application is still pending and open to challenge.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, concerned about brand "confusion," New Zealand parent
company INL enjoined Grace from distributing the magazine in
Australia or New Zealand, said INL lawyer Sarah Hard. And in
Tennessee, the lawyers for Grace, a 5-year-old magazine "for Memphis
women of color," want to bar distribution in that state.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong said she named the magazine to honor her grandmother,
Pauline, who told her, "No matter what, you can always have something
that's your own: style and grace."</TE>

<LD>Acorn Woodpeckers</LD>
<LD>   Did you know that woodpeckers have cushioning around their brains
to protect them from the shock of tap-tap-tapping on wood? They also
have long tongues to reach insects, sharp claws to grip bark and
stiff tail feathers to prop them up against the trunks of trees.</LD>
<LD>   Acorn woodpeckers, like the one shown here, live in pine and oak
trees in the Southwestern United States and along the Pacific Coast
as far south as Colombia, South America.</LD>
<TE>   The acorn woodpecker gets its name from the fact that it pecks
small holes in old or dead trees (or even in telephone poles), then
squeezes an acorn tightly into each hole, storing the food to eat
later. Although these woodpeckers eat mostly insects, sap and fruit,
they can store 20,000 to 50,000 acorns in a single tree. These trees
are called their "granaries."</TE>
<TE>   Acorn woodpeckers live in groups of 12 or more and work together
to make nests, defend their granaries and raise their baby birds.
Both male and female woodpeckers sit on the eggs.</TE>
<TE>   You can hear the "wake-up" call of the acorn woodpecker and see
many other animals during a Family Nature Walk with the Children's
Nature Institute. Trained volunteers lead walks at more than 40 sites
around Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   You can also have fun at the 13th annual Kids' Nature Festival
(for infants to 8-year-olds) Saturday at Temescal Gateway Park, 15601
Sunset Blvd., Pacific Palisades.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets may be purchased at the event, online at www.childrens
natureinstitute.org or by calling (310) 364-3591.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Just as bad money drives good money out of circulation, faux
journalism tends to push the genuine article from the airwaves.</LD>
<LD>   That's the most obvious conclusion to be drawn from this week's
decision by the MSNBC cable network to abandon regular newscasts for
an all-talk format. Beginning July 15, the network will replace its
prime-time news report with a sequence of programs built around
television personalities Chris Matthews, Phil Donahue, Ashleigh
Banfield and Alan Keyes.</LD>
<LD>   Unless breaking--read exciting--events intervene, viewers
interested in facts and reportage will have to content themselves
with a few minutes of "news briefs" hourly from a network that most
recently styled itself "America's News Channel."</LD>
<TE>   "What the executives at MSNBC are doing is giving their viewers
celebrity boxing in disguise," said Orville Schell, dean of UC
Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism.</TE>
<TE>   The reason for the shift is as clear as the numbers from the last
audience survey. Fox News, with its wispy news report and ubiquitous
ranting heads, now leads all three cable news networks with an
average daily audience of 594,000 viewers. CNN, which seems to grow
softer and surlier by the week, follows with 380,000, while MSNBC
averages just 232,000.</TE>
<TE>   But what attracts broadcasting executives to the Fox model is not
just the size of its audience, but also its relatively low cost.
Simply put, Roger Ailes, who runs the network for Rupert Murdoch,
found a way to do cable news on the cheap: Build a sound stage,
install a performing pundit with more predictable opinions than ideas
and encourage as much snarling as possible. Even if one of your
personalities becomes successful enough to command a salary in the
millions, it's still cheaper by far than maintaining bureaus and
paying field reporters and experienced producers to gather and
broadcast news.</TE>
<TE>   But given the relatively small size of the cable networks'
audience--none of the three comes close to attracting the average
daily readership of a major American newspaper--why worry about their
antics?</TE>
<TE>   "They're like a virus implanted on the American media's hard
drive," said Schell. "The actual number of people they've infected so
far is small, but they're steadily contaminating the rest of the
media. They've created a template on how to get more viewers and
readers. They've succeeded in contriving a common wisdom, that if you
don't imitate them in some way, you're falling behind in the race for
market share."</TE>
<TE>   Four days after MSNBC officially capitulates to that idea, the
deans of America's leading journalism schools and representatives of
Harvard's Shorenstein Center will gather for the second time this
year to consider what they regard as a crisis in the quality of
broadcast journalism. In the first week of April, Schell hosted the
journalism deans of USC, the University of Missouri, Northwestern,
Columbia, the University of Maryland, New York University, the
University of Pennsylvania and the University of Texas to consider
the question. Their discussions attracted the attention of the
Carnegie Endowment, which will convene a second meeting in New York
next month.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot more deans want to get in on the discussion this time,"
Schell said. "I'm not sure where we're headed, but if I could wave a
wand, we'd convene an emergency town meeting in Washington, D.C. We'd
invite investors, suits, news directors, anchors, producers,
reporters, scholars, critics and regulators to talk about some other
model for broadcast news."</TE>
<TE>   Fame Without Fortune</TE>
<TE>   This generation's American immigrant authors often seem to live
not so much between worlds as in several parallel worlds
simultaneously. Creatively, it's a stimulating experience, but it
also can be a vexing one.</TE>
<TE>   Take the case of Gina Nahai, an Iranian immigrant of Jewish
descent, whose three critically praised novels--all written in
English--have earned her a substantial following in Iran. What they
have not earned are royalties, because Iran is a country where
literary piracy flourishes.</TE>
<TE>   "Iran is not a signator of the International Copyright
Convention," said Nahai, who nonetheless finds it "interesting and
kind of nice" that her first two novels, "Cry of the Peacock" and
"Moonlight on the Avenue of Faith" have found an audience there. "In
Iran," she explained, "the person who first translates a foreign book
in Farsi owns the rights to it in perpetuity. So when a book comes
out and there is interest, they rush to translate. The first version
is always very bad, but since the translator has the rights forever,
they can take the time to produce a better one.</TE>
<TE>   "In my case," said Nahai, "I'm not really as concerned about the
royalties that have been stolen from me as I am about the fact that
the translation is so bad. Farsi is such a lyrical language with so
many layers that it would have been a treasure to read it in a good
translation."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Nahai is remarkably philosophical about a situation that
would send most American writers into court, at the very least. "We
Iranian Jews have always had this fatalistic attitude toward our
parallel levels of existence," she said. "As an artist, you realize
very early when you belong to a close-knit traditional society, as
ours is, that you need to have halves. There's the social self and
the writing self. The writing self has a lot of people who don't
speak to you, but as a writer you must be truthful. I guess the
experience of having my work stolen just belongs to the Iranian
social half of my life."</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   James McPherson is professor of history at Princeton and the
author of numerous books on the Civil War, including the Pulitzer
Prize-winning "Battle Cry of Freedom": "I've just finished a book on
the Antietam campaign, which was a turning point not only in the
Civil War, but also in American history. It will be published in
September, which is the 140th anniversary of that terrible battle,
the bloodiest single day in our history.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm about to start a book on Gettysburg. It will not be a
traditional history of the battle, but a combination of personal
reflections and anecdotes I've gathered while giving tours of the
battlefield. I think what I'll probably do is walk the reader through
a kind of tour of the battle's three days. Gettysburg has several
layers: There's the battle itself, its memorialization--which began
shortly after and has continued ever since--the interpretation and
reinterpretation that has occurred over the past 140 years. I want to
try and portray some of this by recounting anecdotes from the tours
I've conducted.</TE>
<TE>   "The most common question is asked when people stand near the
Virginia Monument and look across the fields over which Pickett led
his charge. People ask, 'How could Lee do it? Why did he send his men
across those open places?' The short answer is that Lee, who had just
won a great victory at Chancellorville against even greater odds,
overestimated himself and his own troops and underestimated the
morale of the Union troops. It was a fatal combination."</TE>

<HD>A Foot in L.A.'s Door</HD>
<DH>It took awhile, but designer Andrea Pfister has opened a
local boutique</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Italian shoe designer Andrea Pfister has a special fondness for L.A.
because it was here at Robinson's in 1979 that he made his first
personal appearance in the U.S., dressed in a Thierry Mugler space
suit.</LD>
<LD>   "My body has changed a little since then," jokes Pfister, 59, who
now prefers the blue blazer and white pants look of the Italian
Riviera, where he summers, with his trademark red suede loafers.</LD>
<LD>   Still, he remembers the L.A. trip well, especially strolling down
Rodeo Drive for the first time thinking, "This is where I want to
be."</LD>
<TE>   Finally, 23 years later, this is where he is. Pfister was in town
this week to open a Rodeo Drive boutique to showcase his
designs--lipstick red thongs sprouting satin flowers, pumps with
carrot-shaped heels, white leather sandals with silver-studded straps
and other footwear follies, $245 to $620.</TE>
<TE>   In his nearly 40 years in business, he has been a favorite with
fashion divas, from Liz Taylor to Madonna, to Nancy Reagan--who
invited the designer to the White House--to Barbra Streisand.</TE>
<TE>   "Since when does Barbra Streisand seek somebody else's autograph
on her shoes?" The Times wrote in 1979, when Pfister penned his name
on both of the singer's size 8 1/2 lavender lizard and pink suede
heels, drew a heart and added, "To Barbra."</TE>
<TE>   Pfister was born in Pesaro, Italy, the son of a shoe importer. He
studied art in Florence and shoe making in Milan before starting work
for Lanvin and Patou in Paris in 1963. With the help of business and
life partner Jean Pierre Dupre, Pfister launched his line in 1965,
gaining fame for footwear made from exotic skins (lizard, turkey,
snake) with patchwork. In the late 1970s and early '80s, he created
must-have shoes with miniature cutouts of seals, parrots, fish and
other animals on the toes.</TE>
<TE>   He designs at his home in Vigevano or at his Positano retreat on
the Amalfi Coast, which has served as an international party pad over
the years. Inspiration comes from books, art, travel--even wrapping
paper. (Each season, Pfister creates a hand-painted shoe based on a
selection from his extensive stash, collected from around the world).</TE>
<TE>   His work has been exhibited at the Musee International de la
Chaussure Romans, New York's Fashion Institute of Technology, the
Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto and L.A.'s Fashion Institute of Design
and Merchandising, all of which was flattering, but not so much as
seeing his shoes on the street.</TE>
<TE>   All smiles after the opening of his eponymous boutique Tuesday, he
said, "I noticed a woman who kept the shoes she bought on her feet to
go home. These things are very important."</TE>
<TE>   To Protect and Look Good</TE>
<TE>   The legend of the evil eye has captivated Middle Eastern,
Mediterranean and Indo-European cultures for thousands of years, and
now it's caught the eye of Hollywood trendsetters.</TE>
<TE>   Against the Evil Eye bracelets by New York-based designer Lorraine
Schwartz have been spotted on such stars as Britney Spears and
Heather Locklear. Thought to protect the wearer against the "evil eye
curse" of envious people, the gold and semiprecious stone bracelets
cost $3,200 to $8,000 at Fred Leighton, David Orgell; they can also
be ordered by calling (646) 274-2008.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the whole 9/11 situation has made people a lot more
superstitious," says Schwartz, 38. "They just want protection."</TE>
<TE>   Those who prefer not to pay such a high price for protection can
buy enamel versions for $38 each at Kitson on Robertson Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Honors for Owens</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, after 10 years in the business, Los Angeles designer
Rick Owens, 40, nabbed the Perry Ellis Award for Emerging Talent at
the Council of Fashion Designers of America's annual awards ceremony
at the New York Public Library. "At first I said, 'Jeez, I'm a little
old for this,' but it's not about being young, it's about being put
in another level in the industry," the intensely private designer
said Thursday. "And there's really no reason anyone should have
noticed me before because I have only let myself be visible
recently."</TE>
<TE>   Other winners: Marc Jacobs, menswear designer of the year; Carlos
Falchi, accessory designer of the year, and Narciso Rodriguez,
women's wear designer of the year.</TE>

<LD>Dear Fashion Police: I work in an office where the dress code is
business casual. Most of the shirts I wear to work are good-quality
dress shirts with regular or button-down collars.</LD>
<LD>   I have always worn a white T-shirt under my dress shirts with the
first button undone. I think it gives me a clean-cut look. My wife
thinks it looks like my underwear is showing, and that this is not
appropriate for the office. Please give me your opinion.</LD>
<LD>   --HE SAYS, SHE SAYS</LD>
<TE>   Dear He: Sorry, but we have to side with the missus on this one.
Dress shirts shouldn't be worn with a T-shirt showing at the neck.
That's why they're called dress shirts. They're meant to be worn with
a tie and a suit or jacket.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on how casual your office is, you might be able to get
away with wearing a less dressy shirt (please avoid short-sleeve
tailored shirts), which can be worn with the first button undone and
a bit of T-shirt showing. If you're unsure if this will meet your
company's dress code, ask your boss or whoever acts as Keeper of the
Code.</TE>
<TE>   Note to those considering this look: Only a plain, white crew-neck
shirt will do. No V-necks, no sleeveless undershirts. And no T-shirts
that say "I Survived Spring Break!"--even if you're in a pinch. Under
certain lights, your message may be broadcast to the world.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: Now that it's getting warmer, I've begun to
pull out my sleeveless tops, and I need bra help! I spend a lot of
time golfing and hiking, and I need bras with straps that don't peek
out. I'm not particularly well-endowed, so fit is sometimes an issue.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the racerback bras that I've found either aren't padded
and don't fit well, or are what I call "helmet" bras--made of molded
materials that are hot and unnatural-looking. Where can I find a
slightly padded bra to wear with sleeveless tops?</TE>
<TE>   --UNDER COVER</TE>
<TE>   Dear Under: You've been hibernating in a cave too long if you
don't know that showing your bra straps has been a huge trend with
the young set for some time now--so much so that some bras now
feature straps with rhinestones and sequins, just so there's no
chance of missing them.</TE>
<TE>   Someone, however, discovered there are women who don't fit this
demographic and would rather keep their bra straps hidden while
wearing tank tops or dresses with spaghetti straps. That genius (and
we do not use this term lightly) invented bras with invisible straps.
Well, not truly invisible, like some kind of magic bra with super
powers, but clear plastic straps that don't draw attention to
themselves. Though strapless bras will also work, many
women--especially those with larger busts--find them uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   We found some bras featuring attached clear straps, as well as
just clear straps that can be added to bras with removable straps. On
the Web site Nothing Feels Better, there's an invisible-strap bra
with a plunge front and removable push-up pads ($27; www.nothingfeels
better.com, or call [818] 892-6000).</TE>
<TE>   Spiegel also carries a lightly lined plunging bra with invisible
straps ($29; www.Spiegel.com, or call [800] 527-1577).</TE>
<TE>   Invisible Bra Straps will work with any bra with removable straps
and come with white, nude and black hooks; they're online at Lingerie
Solutions ($6; www.lingerie solutions.com, or call [888] 530-2727).</TE>
<TE>   Victoria's Secret's Bare Attitude straps also work with bras with
removable straps ($12; www.victoria ssecret.com, or call [800]
970-1109).</TE>
<TE>   We found this site a bit difficult to navigate, so you'll find the
straps under "special occasion" bras, and the bras with which they
work under "strapless &amp; convertible" (the convertibles are the ones
to look for). If you have any trouble, call and ask for assistance.</TE>
<TE>   FROM THE FASHION POLICE BLOTTER: Moms-to-be, take note: Lands' End
now offers casual maternity wear. The recently launched line isn't
extensive, and you won't find exceptionally trendy pieces, but if
you're looking for cool basics for summer, this is the place.</TE>
<TE>   The collection includes T-shirts, a cardigan and oversized
tailored shirts, as well as several styles of pants (many made out of
stretch fabrics). Prices range from about $20 to $50.</TE>
<TE>   The company also offers diaper bags styled to look like gym bags
for parents with an aversion to those cutesy totes. See it all online
at www.landsend.com, or call (800) 963-4816.</TE>

<HD>An Answer as Murky as the Pool</HD>

<LD>It is past midnight and I can't sleep, for thinking about the boy. So
here I am in my backyard, walking the perimeter of my pool with a
tape measure. Thirty-five feet long, 9 feet deep. Just like the
swimming pool that claimed the life of Paolo Ayala.</LD>
<LD>   I gaze into its murky water at the human form on the deep end's
bottom. It is fuzzy, but definitely a body--that of my fiance, who
has agreed to come by and lie still in the cold, dark water to help
me figure out what's puzzling so many of us: How the body of a
missing child could go unnoticed in a pool for two days?</LD>
<LD>   It is a measure of my own frustration, this crude experiment to
explain a scenario both maddeningly simple and bafflingly complex.</LD>
<TE>   A little boy who cannot swim disappears at a backyard pool party.
The last time any of the party guests saw him he was sitting in the
water in his swimming trunks. Police arrive. They spend two days
searching the neighborhood with dogs and helicopters. Then the
housekeeper spots the body in the pool, where it had been all along.</TE>
<TE>   How it happened is not the question. Drowning is the leading cause
of death among young children in California. Why we didn't figure it
out sooner is what's puzzling.</TE>
<TE>   I think back a few weekends ago, to our own impromptu pool party,
my daughters and half a dozen of their friends, thrashing around in
our swimming pool. When it ended, someone was missing a scrunchie,
those cloth-covered elastic bands that wrap around a ponytail.</TE>
<TE>   We peered into the pool, but no one could see it, so my daughter
and her friends dived into the water to scour the bottom from
end-to-end. A few minutes later, they climbed out, holding the soggy
scrunchie aloft.</TE>
<TE>   If a trio of 10-year-olds can find a twist of elastic on the
bottom of a cloudy pool, how could everyone miss the body of a
7-year-old?</TE>
<TE>   I suppose it is a relief, in a way, to know that no crazy pervert
snatched Paolo from the yard of the Holmby Hills mansion, that he
didn't wander away and into the hands of someone who would strangle
or torture or murder him.</TE>
<TE>   Better that he simply slipped beneath the water's surface and
drowned, without even enough of a struggle to disrupt the birthday
party or attract the attention of anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Or is it? We are freed of the frightening fantasy of stranger
abduction but left to reconcile the bewildering reality that a little
boy vanished in the midst of a party and no one noticed. And once
people realized he was gone, they ignored the obvious for too long,
and instead chased phantom boogeymen.</TE>
<TE>   In the three days since Paolo's body was found, it's been the
obsession of the talk show crowd.</TE>
<TE>   With all those adults attending the party, how could no one be
watching that child?</TE>
<TE>   If you've ever been to a child's birthday party, you know the
answer to that question. The kids play; the grown-ups socialize.</TE>
<TE>   Why didn't he know how to swim? He was 7 years old. My kids took
lessons when they were 3.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone has a pool, or belongs to the Y or a country club.
Paolo had never been to a big pool party. For families like his,
swimming lessons are a luxury.</TE>
<TE>   Why didn't his parents stay at the party, to keep an eye on him?</TE>
<TE>   You're a maintenance man, your wife works as a baby-sitter. Your
English isn't good. You live with your three kids in a one-bedroom
apartment. How intimidating is the thought of spending two hours
hobnobbing with rich people with whom you have nothing in common. So
you drop your child off at the party, figuring the hosts are smart
enough, at least, to make sure the kids are supervised.</TE>
<TE>   And my question: What compelled police to start searching hither
and yon before anyone dived into the pool to check out the most
logical place his body might be?</TE>
<TE>   We've heard all the theories, explanations, excuses. We know
hindsight is 20/20. "Dozens of people ... looked in the pool and came
to the same conclusion," said a police commander, trying to explain
how a search missed the obvious. Blame an "optical illusion" that can
obscure a body in the chalky water of an aging pool.</TE>
<TE>   But it still seems like common sense to me that when a little boy
disappears, the last place he was seen was in the swimming pool and
you realize that he didn't know how to swim, you're inclined to do
more than just eyeball the pool. Anything less is a sloppy
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   They talked of "checking" the pool, but not "sweeping" the pool.
But this is not rocket science; it didn't require complicated
equipment. Why didn't anybody strip down to their skivvies and simply
dive in to scour the bottom?</TE>
<TE>   Instead, police were primed to believe that something sinister had
occurred: The edge around the yard was unfenced. A police dog on
Wilshire picked up the boy's scent. All kinds of elaborate theories
were considered in lieu of the most logical explanation. I guess
stranger danger is easier to accept than suburban fallibility.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't have made a difference" if they'd found the body that
day, a police spokesman said. "No one should feel guilty. There is
nothing anyone could have done." Tell that to Paolo's parents, who
spent two days in unimaginable hell, not knowing if their son was
alive or dead.</TE>
<TE>   Police say parents should take a lesson from this, to watch
children in the pool more carefully. That is good advice, certainly.
Every pool should have a fence, every party a lifeguard, every child
who can't swim a safety vest.</TE>
<TE>   But I hope police take a lesson as well, and not just the
platitude they've offered up about not relying on what you think you
see. Sometimes the most logical answer is the right one.</TE>
<TE>   And in this case, the simplest explanation--that a little boy
drowned and no one noticed--might be the hardest to bear.</TE>

<LD>   saw me</LD>
<TE>   jump out,</TE>
<TE>   they were so happy!</TE>
<TE>   Jilly actu-</TE>
<TE>   ally started to cry. Then she hugged and kissed me.</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Rogers apologized. "Oh, Fluffy," she said, "I'm so sorry I
closed that door by mistake. Please forgive me."</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Rogers didn't say a word. He just smiled from ear to ear.</TE>
<TE>   Johnny was glad to see me, too, but mostly he was proud of that
dog. He patted him on the head and said, "Good boy, Billy!" Then he
told him, "You're a real detective, Billy. You solved the mystery of
the missing cat. From now on I think we should call you Detective
Billy."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone laughed. I didn't think it was so funny, but then Jilly
said, "It's true. Detective Billy saved Fluffy's life."</TE>
<TE>   Saved my life? Well, not exactly. I mean I wasn't perishing in
that closet. I was just uncomfortable, and now that dog--uh--I mean
Detective Billy--thinks he's a hero or something.</TE>
<TE>   So I've decided I have to tolerate that dog--uh--I mean Detective
Billy, and I don't spit at him, anymore. I don't even show my
claws--though he can be quite annoying running</TE>
<TE>   around in circles or fanning me with that wagging tail or making
those awful arfing noises.</TE>
<TE>   And the worst thing of all is that he has some crazy idea that we
can be friends. He keeps rolling his ball at me and wants me to roll
it back. No thank you! Not for me! No ball games with that dog--uh--I
mean Detective Billy. I just quietly ignore him, and that's not easy
because he hasn't stopped his staring habit. All day and all night!
Those eyes! They just keep staring. Ho hum!</TE>

<HD>R. Kelly Posts Bail as Fallout Begins</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* The singer's attorney denies child porn charges.
Meanwhile, L.A. radio remains cool to his music, but the debate rages
at stations elsewhere.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON and GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As troubled R&amp;B singer R. Kelly made his first court appearance
Thursday in relation to child pornography charges, radio stations
around the country grappled with whether to continue playing the
popular artist's music.</LD>
<LD>   Appearing in a Polk County, Fla., courthouse near his home, where
he was arrested Wednesday, Kelly, 34, listened as the judge set bail
at $750,000 and forbade him to have contact with minors unrelated to
him.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly later posted bond and was freed. His attorney, Ed Genson,
said the singer would return to Chicago "as soon as he gets his
composure, as soon as he sees his wife and kisses his babies, as soon
as he puts on a new set of clothes and is able to get a few hours'
sleep."</LD>
<TE>   The indictment was handed down Wednesday in Chicago. The singer,
whose real name is Robert Kelly, faces 21 felony counts of child
pornography based on a videotape that allegedly shows him engaged in
sexual acts with an underage girl in one of Kelly's Chicago
residences.</TE>
<TE>   "The claims in this case are unfounded," Genson said after the
court hearing. "The charge is that there's a young lady under the age
of 18 on that tape, and there isn't."</TE>
<TE>   In the singer's hometown of Chicago, two prominent radio stations
took opposite tacks in the wake of the charges.</TE>
<TE>   "Child pornography is not a funny thing and if he is indeed found
guilty, I don't want to be the radio station that keeps playing his
music," said Todd Cavanaugh, program director at WBBM-FM (96.3).
"It's a much bigger deal, so we are definitely not going to play R.
Kelly. If he is found innocent, we will definitely readdress the
issue, but right now, there is no R. Kelly on B96."</TE>
<TE>   But Marv Dyson, president and general manager of WGCI-FM (107.5),
said: "He's still innocent until proven guilty, and I guess he's
going to have his day in court. That's still our position, and we
will continue to play his music, at least as of this moment."</TE>
<TE>   BET, the cable network that targets black viewers, devoted much of
its Wednesday-evening programming to the Kelly indictment. The story
received prominent coverage on BET's newscast and was the sole
subject during the topical discussion series "BET Tonight."</TE>
<TE>   One of those interviewed on that show was Howard McGee, a WGCI
disc jockey. McGee told host Ed Gordon that before the indictment,
many listeners were placing blame on the young victim, saying she had
enticed Kelly. He added that if Kelly was found guilty, listeners
would be asked whether they would like the station to continue
playing the singer's music.</TE>
<TE>   McGee added that in an informal call-in poll, 99% of callers said
they would continue to support Kelly's music, saying his private life
should be judged separately from his musical projects.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the arrest provoked little discussion Thursday
morning on urban-oriented stations such as KKBT-FM (100.3--the Beat)
and KPWR-FM (105.9--Power 106). Executives at both stations said that
they had not received much audience reaction to the indictment, and
that Kelly's music is not on their play lists because of lack of
listener interest.</TE>
<TE>   Said Robert Scorpi, programming director of the Beat: "We're not
taking a stand on R. Kelly, but we will really examine very carefully
what he puts out in the future, because his music is very sexual.
We're not playing him now because there were no requests for his last
records. But for us to say we'll never play R. Kelly again is not
necessarily true."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly's label for the past 11 years, Jive Records, issued a brief
statement Thursday saying, "We fully support him and his music."</TE>
<TE>   The singer's most recent recording, "The Best of Both Worlds," a
highly anticipated collaboration with rapper Jay-Z, fell far short of
sales expectations as reports of the video began to circulate shortly
before the album's April release.</TE>
<TE>   With his smooth, soulful tracks, Kelly accounted for more Top 40
hits in the 1990s than any other solo male artist. Among the songs
was his 1996 hit "I Believe I Can Fly," which became an inspirational
anthem used in the Michael Jordan film "Space Jam," at countless
athletic events and in commercials. He performed his song "The
World's Greatest" at the opening ceremony of this year's Winter
Olympics. Kelly's albums have sold more than 14 million copies in the
U.S., and, as a producer, he also helped craft major hits for stars
such as Michael Jackson and the late R&amp;B singer Aaliyah.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly was briefly married to Aaliyah in 1994--a union that took
place when she was 15. The marriage was later annulled. Kelly has
also faced a series of civil lawsuits from women who alleged that he
had sex with them when they were underage. Kelly denied the
allegations but has acknowledged settling two of those suits upon the
advice of his attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly is married to a former dancer from his touring troupe. They
have a newborn son and two young daughters, and have lived for more
than a year at a rented home about 20 miles southwest of Walt Disney
World.</TE>

<HD>Dear Nut: Who Are You Really?</HD>
<DH>Television * 'Letters From a Nut' writer Ted L. Nancy has a
pilot deal, but his identity is a mystery. Rumors that he's Seinfeld
have proved groundless.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reports last week of Jerry Seinfeld's return to network TV were
apparently greatly exaggerated. But then, this is a story that
involves a network, ABC, whose prime-time lineup needs help and a
central figure whose identity remains, in the words of one insider,
"a bloodless mystery."</LD>
<LD>   Ted L. Nancy is not Deep Throat. But he is, at the very least,
deeply flawed. Nancy is the author of three books--"Letters From a
Nut," "More Letters From a Nut" and "Extra Nutty! Even More Letters
From a Nut"--a kind of collected works of his loopy correspondence
with corporate America. Nancy, for instance, wrote to the Baseball
Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., asking if it wanted to enshrine
Mickey Mantle's toenail clippings, which Nancy just happened to have
in his possession. The fact that companies responded, in earnest, to
Nancy's requests is where the idiot-meets-idiot comedy comes in, said
Barry Marder, who is crafting a TV pilot based on the books. It is
also evidently what tickled Seinfeld, who wrote introductions to all
three books. The fact that Nancy has not been identified is what has
fueled the notion that he is Seinfeld.</LD>
<TE>   The comedian helped pitch "Letters" as a TV show, taking meetings
with several networks. When ABC announced a pilot deal last week,
speculation flew that Seinfeld would be returning to network TV in
some capacity. But he appears only to have been along for the ride as
a character witness to the material.</TE>
<TE>   Understanding the power of any press involving the name Seinfeld,
ABC did little to quell speculation that the comedian was Nancy. This
week, rumors surfaced that Nancy was actually comedian Bruce Baum, or
maybe comedian Marder.</TE>
<TE>   Baum, reached in Las Vegas, where he is performing this weekend at
the Riviera, said he isn't Nancy. But Baum, who used to go by the
stage name "Babyman" did say he will be a producer on the show. "I
wish I could say I was him, with all the attention he's getting,"
Marder added.</TE>
<TE>   This did not exactly seem like a firm denial. If ABC picks up the
show, Marder and Rob Lee said they would be executive producers.</TE>
<TE>   And Seinfeld? "I think he's just a fan of the books," said Marder.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy is identified on the book jacket as a resident of Thousand
Oaks, but attempts to reach him in the past have proved unsuccessful.
Seinfeld has also denied being Nancy but acknowledged that he helped
get the letters published.</TE>
<TE>   Marder is an old friend of Seinfeld's from their early-1980s days
in stand-up. Since then, Seinfeld has gone on to be Seinfeld. Marder
said he has been living off his lucrative Saturday-night earnings
from all those years onstage at the Melrose Improv. "I also had a
hair salon, and that kept me busy throughout the '80s," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Marder said he's met Nancy only once. "That was seven years ago,
when all this started," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hmmm. Would Nancy be participating in the show? And if so, does he
have any TV experience?</TE>
<TE>   "I think he was on a 'Diff'rent Strokes' episode," Marder said.</TE>

<HD>A KPFK Pledge to Listen to Listeners</HD>
<DH>The liberal station's new general manager, who got her
start in South Africa, knows a thing or two about activism and
community involvement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As bitter as it got, it must seem like a mere playground spat--the
infighting and turmoil that beset the left-leaning Pacifica radio
network and its Los Angeles outlet over the past several years. The
station's new general manager is used to dealing with more than
pickets, angry phone calls and spam.</LD>
<LD>   Eva Georgia was a pioneer in community radio in South Africa
during the apartheid era, when she was harassed, threatened at
gunpoint, and had colleagues killed and kidnapped while they all
sought to expose police corruption, the AIDS epidemic and violence
against women and children. On Monday, she takes over KPFK-FM (90.7),
and pledges to re-connect the community-supported station with
alienated listeners.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm extremely excited about the prospect. There's a lot to do,"
said Georgia, 34. "It will take time, and I hope that people will
allow us the time. It's important that the process of democracy and
transparency continue.</LD>
<TE>   "We have to keep chiseling away at this big iceberg," she said.
"Pacifica has a rich history and it has so much potential. It's
electrifying."</TE>
<TE>   The Pacifica Foundation, started by pacifists in Berkeley after
World War II, originated listener-supported radio and evolved into a
five-station network devoted to progressive politics and
social-justice issues. But the foundation has been embroiled in
conflict for several years, with disaffected listeners and even
foundation board members suing the organization. They alleged that a
majority of the board was steering the network to the political
center, ignoring the listener-supporters, firing longtime staff
without cause, and even moving to sell the valuable broadcast
licenses. The sides settled the lawsuits in December, and since then
the new regime of former dissidents has overhauled the organization.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia replaces a pair of interim general managers, who
themselves replaced general manager Mark Schubb, fired in January
after clashes with the new Pacifica board.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought her selection sends an important signal. We're serious
about building a democratic organization," said Dan Coughlin, the
Pacifica Foundation's interim executive director. He noted that
Georgia played no part in the fight against previous management.
"We're not engaged in cronyism or purges. We're really trying to
select the person who is best for the network. Just because you were
a reform activist doesn't mean you're going to get a job now."</TE>
<TE>   A 13-member search committee consisting of staff, listeners and
Pacifica board member David Fertig sifted through nearly 50
applicants and chose three finalists, Georgia and the managers of a
community station in Moab, Utah, and a college station in San Jose.
Coughlin made the final selection.</TE>
<TE>   "She stood out, both with her experience in community radio and
her commitment to Pacifica and KPFK. She really shined," Coughlin
said. He also cited her background in "managing a station in a highly
charged environment."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, Georgia had been trying to get a job at KPFK since she
moved to Long Beach from South Africa in 1999, but could never get an
interview with previous management for openings as news director and
program director. Now she'll be the one hiring for those jobs, which
she said still haven't been filled permanently.</TE>
<TE>   Programming disputes and the lawsuits estranged KPFK from many
supporters, with the station refusing even to air meeting notices for
its listener advisory board. So, in addition to improving staff
morale, Georgia said she wants to embrace and enlarge KPFK's
audience, and get more active in the community.</TE>
<TE>   The community station she started in South Africa, Radio Atlantis,
not only aired programs about sexual abuse, but also worked with
government, labor and social organizations to create safe houses for
battered women, and sponsored education programs for schoolgirls.</TE>
<TE>   "How else do you define community radio? It has to have the
community participation, not just on the air, but in community
outreach," she said. "That is just so important, that we don't just
talk the talk, but find solutions to the problems in the community."</TE>
<TE>   Georgia's Commitment Convinced the Committee</TE>
<TE>   Fertig, an Altadena-based employment discrimination attorney, said
that commitment is part of what swayed the selection committee.</TE>
<TE>   "She not only spread the news, but helped address the problem," he
said, whether it was mediating between factions involved in gang
violence, or opening a forum to discuss community problems in
Atlantis, the black township where she lived, which at one time had
the world's highest murder rate and 47% unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   As a teenager, Georgia started writing for newspapers in her
hometown, Cape Town, until she noticed her articles were being
censored. At 21 she started her own community paper in Atlantis,
north of Cape Town. Then she decided to fulfill a lifelong dream:
"Since the age of 10, I said I'd be in radio. I'd run home from
school and listen to radio serials."</TE>
<TE>   Gathering support from community groups and the area's powerful
South African Clothing and Textile Workers Union, she finally
received a government license and went on the air in 1995. The
station became so integral to the community, factories played it
nonstop during the workday, and workers went on strike when employers
shut it off.</TE>
<TE>   Radio Atlantis hosted numerous party candidates before an
election, and investigated the background of the politicians they
were going to be interviewing--standard practice in American
journalism, but risky behavior at that time in South Africa. The
research led to drug and prostitution ties, and threats and
intimidation from those being scrutinized.</TE>
<TE>   When 8- to 12-year-old black children began disappearing, their
bodies later turning up dismembered, Georgia called the police racist
for not pursuing the cases more diligently. That brought 200 officers
swarming the radio station. Then, when police arrested a suspect on
what Georgia thought was flimsy evidence, she put the accused on the
air to give his side--angering the citizens of Atlantis.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if you don't agree with somebody," she said, the sides ought
to have a forum to air their views, and discuss their differences
peacefully. Then "the listeners should decide for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   But the dangers persisted. A police commissioner investigating
corruption died in a mysterious car crash, while a journalist
subpoenaed to testify about what he had uncovered was murdered the
day before the hearing, she said. Georgia herself was accosted at a
stoplight by an assailant who put a gun to her head, and her home was
ransacked. And a friend working with her to uncover corruption
disappeared without a trace.</TE>
<TE>   It was 1999 and Georgia finally reached a breaking point. Fearing
the violence would reach her family if she kept muckraking in South
Africa, she fled to the United States and was granted asylum by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service. She moved to Long Beach,
where she had friends, and managed an HIV-prevention program for
youth at the Gay &amp; Lesbian Community Center of Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "I never wanted to leave, to let them get the upper hand, but I
also had my family to think of," she said, adding that she hasn't
seen them in three years. "It was, to me, worth it to risk everything
to give a voice to the community. And I'd do it again in a
heartbeat."</TE>
<TE>   Fertig said Georgia is committed to broadening KPFK's audience, to
appeal not only to "lefty liberals west of La Cienega," as he said,
but to Latinos and blacks and Asians. "We've got a really diverse
audience, and need to get that on the air more."</TE>
<TE>   Under new management, the station has held consecutive
record-breaking fund drives, raising $719,000 in February and
$618,000 last month, Coughlin said. Fertig said those figures prove
that once-disgruntled listeners are returning to the station, and
that new ones are responding to programming changes. Much of that
money has gone to repair transmitter and antenna problems that have
kept the station broadcasting at reduced power for more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   But over the next two weeks the station's new transmitter will get
up and running, boosting the signal from 8,000 watts to 28,000 and
finally back to its original 112,000 watts--what station officials
have long boasted is the strongest signal west of the Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   As with almost all matters at Pacifica, Georgia's selection was
not without controversy. The manager of Bush Radio, another community
broadcast outlet in Cape Town, wrote Pacifica officials saying that
his station was the first on the air, not Radio Atlantis as a
Pacifica news release about Georgia had said. And he criticized her
move in 1997 from Radio Atlantis to Cape Talk, a commercial
talk-radio station in Cape Town. But Georgia said she made the choice
simply because the commercial station gave her a more powerful outlet
for her advocacy and investigations.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up in a highly politicized community with a lot of
activists," she said. "We were willing to put our lives on the line
to tell the truth."</TE>

<HD>Same Rukeyser, Same Well-Honed Mix--It's Just a New Network</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fans of the long-running "Wall Street Week With Louis Rukeyser" may
be seeing double these days.</LD>
<LD>   The new "Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street" on CNBC is nearly a clone
of his old PBS show, down to the guest list, shiny leather furniture
and wax fruit. The new "Wall Street Week" (without Rukeyser) on PBS,
a Friday-night place holder until the co-branded "Wall Street Week
With Fortune" starts June 28, also is basically the same show as its
predecessor, but with humorless guest hosts.</LD>
<LD>   Channel surfers during the 8:30 time slot could be confused by all
this, if somehow they missed reports of the spat this spring between
Rukeyser and PBS. After 32 years on the air, Rukeyser was
unceremoniously dumped by Maryland Public Television in a PR blunder
that some commentators, including the normally jovial Rukeyser
himself, saw as borderline elder abuse. The producers and PBS already
were revamping the show in an effort to reach a younger audience, and
Rukeyser was unhappy with the reduced role planned for him.</LD>
<TE>   Rukeyser's seamless transition to cable comes as no surprise. His
original show is older than the Nasdaq--not to mention many of
today's mutual fund managers.</TE>
<TE>   Some commentators, perhaps jealous of his $20-million-a-year
empire of investment newsletters, speeches, conferences and cruises,
call Rukeyser a pompous and shallow self-promoter, but he has a
well-honed and winning formula. Easy to watch, easy to understand.</TE>
<TE>   The format starts with Rukey- ser's pithy opening commentary,
followed by a cordial round-table discussion of the economy and the
stock market with the week's panelists and guest.</TE>
<TE>   Rukeyser opened a recent show in typically droll style, telling
the story of a salesman who tries to sell a pricey feeding system to
a farmer by noting that it gets pigs ready for market much faster.
The sly farmer replies, "What's time to a hog?" Which is Rukeyser's
way of saying the market just needs time to recover along with the
U.S. economy, so chill out.</TE>
<TE>   For PBS, the true test comes later this month when the wraps come
off the new show, to be co-hosted by Geoffrey Colvin, editorial
director of AOL Time Warner Inc.'s Fortune magazine, and financial
broadcaster Karen Gibbs. Interim guest hosts have filled in smoothly,
using a no-nonsense approach. They included Marshall Loeb, senior
correspondent for the Web site CBSMarketwatch.com, who last week
interviewed investment manager Tim Ghriskey.</TE>
<TE>   Investors can get a double dose of advice and analysis even
without channel flipping or using the VCR, at least if they have
cable. CNBC airs "Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street" at 5:30 p.m. on
Fridays as well as head-to-head against his old show, and some PBS
stations rebroadcast the CNBC version on weekends through a special
arrangement (KCET in Los Angeles is not among them, however).</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, both programs could feature lively exchanges. Rukeyser
will chat with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Chairman David Komansky about the
crisis in confidence plaguing Wall Street, where brokerage analysts
are under fire because of conflicts of interest. The guest host on
PBS, veteran broadcaster Ray Brady, talks with energy analyst Charles
Maxwell about an industry beset by accounting scandals, ongoing
investigations and even personal tragedies such as the apparent
suicide of an executive that rocked the shares of El Paso Corp. this
week.</TE>
<TE>   It will be interesting to see what PBS and Fortune come up with,
but for now, the Rukeyser formula times two is not half bad. These
days it's reassuring to know that anything on Wall Street still
works.</TE>

<HD>Complex Issues in 'Merchant' Handled Well at Theatricum</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is Shakespeare's always-controversial "The Merchant of Venice" an
anti-Semitic play, a play about anti-Semitism, or a play that
features characters who happen to be anti-Semites, but is really
about something else entirely?</LD>
<LD>   Probably a little of all of those things. But if you're even
contemplating attending a performance of "Merchant of Venice"--in
which Shylock, the scorned and vengeful Jewish moneylender, demands
the infamous "pound of flesh" from his Christian debtor--you're
probably already past expecting political correctness in the 16th
century.</LD>
<LD>   During the opening matinee performance of "Merchant" at rustic
outdoor Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum in Topanga Canyon, three white
doves showed up, and spent the second act cozied together in the big
tree that spreads its branches over the stage. Let's take that as a
sign that this "Merchant" comes in peace--presented in spite of, not
because of, the repugnant attitudes of the day.</LD>
<TE>   Whew, that's out of the way. Now the only question becomes, is
this production of "The Merchant of Venice" a good production of "The
Merchant of Venice"?</TE>
<TE>   The answer is: a very good production indeed.</TE>
<TE>   This play--with its weird blend of exquisitely beautiful
commentary on tolerance in the monologues of Shylock, ugly racist
cant on the part of most everybody else, and broad romantic comedy
based on mistaken identity--will always be problematic. Still, as
directed by Botanicum artistic director Ellen Geer, this "Merchant"
is zesty, fast-paced, conversational and clear as a bell.</TE>
<TE>   Clear, that is, except for Jeff Marlowe as the hilariously fey
Prince of Arragon, failed suitor to the lovely Portia, whose accent
lies somewhere between Spain and outer space. While the actor is a
hoot, rolling his rrrrrrrr's up to the stratosphere, he'd be even
funnier if we could understand more than 50% of what he's saying.</TE>
<TE>   Other performances are equally strong--and easier to understand.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Blumenfeld makes for a sympathetic Shylock, his imposing
stockiness and stentorian voice an effective contrast to this
character's powerlessness within his own society. Susan Angelo is a
glowing comic standout as the vain and world-weary Portia, as is
Edward (Ted) Barton as Shylock's gnome-like servant, Lancelot Gobbo,
covered in false humility and a thin layer of dirt.</TE>
<TE>   Director Geer's only moment of dramatic editorializing comes at
the end, when she adds a silent sequence in which Shylock, after
being forced by the court to convert to Christianity, returns home
and lights Shabbat candles alone, in secret defiance. An interesting
twist, but one that jarringly diverts one's attention from
Shakespeare's exploration of the quality of mercy in the 1500s to the
politics of diversity, 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "The Merchant of Venice," Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, 1419 N.
Topanga Canyon Blvd., Topanga. Sundays, 4 p.m. Ends Sept. 29.

<HD>Godzilla's Cultural Footprint</HD>
<DH>Art* The lizard king morphs from a kitsch icon into high
art in a Japanese city that was spared in the monster's 25 films.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HANS GREIMEL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>KAWASAKI, Japan</DL>
<LD>Don't be fooled by the zippered-up lizard suit, plastic-model
skylines and stock footage of crowds fleeing in terror when Godzilla
smashes into town.</LD>
<LD>   Japan's favorite nuclear-powered monster has finally crossed the
threshold from campy kitsch to high art--at least according to a
Japanese museum drawing thousands with its Godzilla-as-art exhibit.</LD>
<LD>   "There are people who look at Godzilla and laugh. But really this
is a part of Japanese culture and history," said Hiroshi Ohsugi,
curator at the Taro Okamoto Museum of Art in the Tokyo suburb of
Kawasaki, one city not destroyed in 25 films of Godzilla rampages.</LD>
<TE>   "Since Godzilla," on view through July 28, is the world's first
art show looking at Godzilla as a cultural phenomenon, not just a pop
icon of lowbrow thrills, Ohsugi said.</TE>
<TE>   Packed with rubbery green Godzilla suits used in several movies,
as well as model buildings, props, still photos and film clips, the
exhibit chronicles Godzilla as a looking glass on Japanese society
over the last half-century.</TE>
<TE>   Nuclear bombs, rapid economic growth, space travel, the Cold War,
pollution and the dangers of biotechnology are just some of the
issues touched upon.</TE>
<TE>   The opening hall takes visitors back to 1954, when the original
grainy black-and-white "Godzilla" hit the screens.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, the monster's origins in a hydrogen-bomb test evoked
special terror for a nation still traumatized by the atomic attacks
in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Impact was heightened that year by a U.S.
nuclear test in the Pacific that showered a nearby Japanese fishing
boat with radioactive ash.</TE>
<TE>   Pitted pieces of gray fallout, on display solemnly encased in
glass, set an immediate somber tone at the exhibit, as does a
blood-red banner of a mushroom cloud enshrouding an entire wall.</TE>
<TE>   The early films were likewise angry and dark, allegories of a
war-battered nation still rebuilding--"King Kong vs. Godzilla" was a
political shot at Japan's postwar U.S. occupiers. But that message
faded as economic revival blotted out memories of defeat.</TE>
<TE>   During the late 1950s and 1960s, professional wrestlers zipped up
in monster suits to spice up the on-screen wrangling, and to tap the
popularity of professional wrestling that dominated programming on
the nation's TV sets.</TE>
<TE>   Worries about pollution took center stage in the 1970s, and so did
a new Godzilla foe: Hedora, or the Sludge Monster, a toxin-gobbling,
shape-shifting blob. Godzilla defeated it, just as he did a
genetically engineered version of himself crossed with a rose
plant--yes, a rose plant--in 1989's "Godzilla vs. Biollante."</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit evokes mixed reactions, with one Godzilla fan who
strolled the aisles calling it "a little embarrassing." But even
those who grew up with the fire-breathing monster walked away with a
new perspective on the lizard king.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know there were so many social issues at play," said
27-year-old Reiko Watabe. "This is the first time I heard the whole
Godzilla story."</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, Godzilla lashes out at the modern, garish buildings that
epitomize Japan's aesthetically numbing dash into post-industrialism.</TE>
<TE>   And the legend lives on with Godzilla's creator, movie house Toho
Co., churning out a new creature feature every December in what's
become a Japanese New Year's tradition.</TE>
<TE>   Ohsugi defended Godzilla's inclusion in his museum, which houses
the permanent collection of famed Japanese modern artist Taro
Okamoto, because he says Godzilla, like all true art, is a "kind of
mirror" on society.</TE>
<TE>   He also compared Godzilla's legacy to that of Japan's now
priceless woodblock prints, which were run off hundreds at a time
during the feudal era and dismissed then as mere tourist trinkets.</TE>
<TE>   "In 100 years, maybe this too will be highly esteemed as art. But
I just couldn't wait that long," Ohsugi said.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit is drawing up to 1,000 people a day--about double the
museum's normal attendance.</TE>
<TE>   "We are extremely proud," Toho producer Shogo Tomiyama said. "But
whether Godzilla is true art or not, I don't know. Everybody has a
different definition of that."</TE>

<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Any news program that bans "team coverage" earns a booming Hi-yo!
here.</LD>
<LD>   That's just one reason why "California Connected" may be the
brightest idea to splash this state since sunshine. All right, it has
some early ruts. No harm in gee-whiz hyperbole, though, when the
topic is a weekly hour with this much promise, one following a
serpentine trail of news through the most dazzling, complex, diverse
and fascinating state in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   This concept has been tried in California before, but with much
less flare and visibility.</LD>
<TE>   Collaborators on this 7-week-old newsmagazine are public
television stations--KCET in Los Angeles, KQED in San Francisco, KVIE
in Sacramento and KPBS in San Diego. Stations in Eureka, Fresno,
Redding and San Bernardino air it too.</TE>
<TE>   It's designed to find threads symbiotically linking California's
archipelago of interests and ethnicities. That makes it a hard-news
sibling of the folksy cultural pieces that California traveler Huell
Howser has provided KCET viewers for years.</TE>
<TE>   And the antithesis of L.A.'s local newscasts.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial stations will cover the state Assembly and Senate, for
example, only when Democrats and Republicans start chasing each other
in cars on freeways. Equating Sacramento with Jupiter and Uranus,
they're waiting for a spaceship to get them there.</TE>
<TE>   These stations burn their budgets sending reporters off to cover
showy stories abroad while telling you to take Yuba City and shove
it. You can have Siskiyou too. And why pay attention to Stockton?
Isn't it the capital of Sweden?</TE>
<TE>   So now comes much smarter "California Connected" with its
ambitious hybrid of statewide news and quirky features, a rare strong
anchor-interviewer in David Brancaccio, talking heads that
infrequently invite slumber, and early stories embracing worthy
subjects from drinking-water pollution to Mexican field laborers
living squalidly in wine-rich Napa and Sonoma. For them, 2002 is no
vintage year.</TE>
<TE>   Among the program's liveliest components is its regular "Dish"
panel--humorist Will Durst and journalists from the Sacramento Bee,
Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times and Univision, so far. These
schmoozers are guided by Brancaccio, who is just the kind of bright,
articulate moderator, with a sense of fun, who could bring a pulse
beat to KCET's own nightly discussion program, "Life &amp; Times," as it
stiffens on the slab. But he's keeping his day job as host of public
radio's "Marketplace."</TE>
<TE>   Another contributor is Jeff Stilson, most recently executive
producer of MTV's surprise big sizzle, "The Osbournes." Stilson's
background is comedy, and in his role here as the program's snarling
sendup, "Enemy of the State," he goes on location to launch
kick-California rants that are wittily pretty much on point. A region
where even a tiny drizzle is called "Storm Watch 2002"? Yup, he's
nailed it.</TE>
<TE>   "California Connected" will rise or fall, though, on its hard-news
magazine pieces reported on camera by such California veterans as
Alison Tom, Hena Cuevas, Saul Gonzalez and former L.A. newsman David
Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   It's here where executive producer Marley Klaus' series marches to
PBS rhythms. Think "The News-</TE>
<TE>   Hour With Jim Lehrer" and those lengthy, thoughtful (all right,
sometimes too lengthy, tediously thoughtful) pieces with worldviews,
capped by talking heads for context.</TE>
<TE>   A recent meaty "California Connected" piece on severe problems at
Mount Vernon Middle School in Los Angeles ran 17 interesting minutes,
for instance, and was updated a week later. Expect fewer one-night
stands than on typical newsmagazines, for this one does not practice
"drive-by journalism," noted Brancaccio.</TE>
<TE>   No less perceptive was the program's take on the likely June 30
closings of five privately operated low-security prisons--in a move
Gov. Gray Davis says he is instigating to cut costs--and the
predicted impact of this on local communities that rely on these
inmates as cheap labor for essential services.</TE>
<TE>   The program visited Baker Community Facility east of Los Angeles.
There, inmates work in school maintenance and staff the emergency
fire department, servicing an accident-prone stretch of Interstate 15
heavily used by Southern California motorists. Although the story was
balanced, viewers were told that once the inmates leave, emergency
response will be an hour away.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' approval of a hefty raise for the state's prison guards,
whose union backs his reelection, had "California Connected"
revisiting charges that his plan to close privately run facilities is
less a function of good policy than politics.</TE>
<TE>   "California Connected" personalized this story just as it attached
human faces and voices to undocumented farm workers in wine country.
There, the homeless underclass lives appallingly in "hidden camps"
not far from upscale homes. One of them emptied his knapsack to
display his possessions. "I have scissors for cutting. Here is my
flashlight...."</TE>
<TE>   Defining itself as populist, the program solicits ideas and
video-cam contributions from viewers while encouraging them to find
more information at its Web site (www.californiaconnected.org), which
is swanky looking and, as a bonus, user-friendly.</TE>
<TE>   But about those ruts.</TE>
<TE>   There are times you're parched just from watching "California
Connected." Hats off to it for tackling the complicated yet critical
story of the gasoline additive MTBE showing up in the state's
drinking water. Although admirably detailed, the presentation turned
a liquid issue into an arid desert, affirming how hard it is to tell
some stories on TV.</TE>
<TE>   One California issue the series inexplicably hasn't touched--and
says it won't cover soon even though it will be on the November
ballot--is an epic one of potential disconnection. That would be the

<HD>A Fast-Track Life Is Derailed</HD>
<DH>The makers of 'ivansxtc' care deeply about their
self-destructive Hollywood player of a protagonist. But will the
audience?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "ivansxtc," Danny Huston is so dazzling as a charismatic,
high-living Hollywood agent suddenly confronted with mortality at the
moment of his greatest success that it makes the film seem all the
more disappointing. Director Bernard Rose and co-writer Lisa Enos,
who is also the film's leading lady, have drawn inspiration from
Tolstoy's "The Death of Ivan Ilyich" and the fate of Rose's agent Jay
Maloney, whose meteoric career crashed over cocaine addiction and
whose life ended in suicide. They bring an insider's perspective to
Ivan's story but have made a major miscalculation in the way they
tell it.</LD>
<LD>   They clearly care deeply about Huston's Ivan Beckman and lay on
swaths of Wagner and Chopin to pump up his destiny to the level of
tragedy. However, they are unable to make it clear why an audience
should feel the same about Ivan, a bold, confident dealmaker whose
fast-track life catches up with him. To the filmmakers, Ivan is a
prince of a fellow, but he comes across as shallow and glib though
not mean-spirited, and there's no indication that he's been
responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or
merit.</LD>
<TE>   It's sad when anyone dies so young, and there's a certain pathos
in his discovery of how truly alone he is when he finds death staring
him in the face. Yet, to put it bluntly, Ivan's death seems no great
loss, and therefore it's hard to understand why the filmmakers
consider his story worthy of a movie in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   It might have been different if their approach had been coolly
ironic rather than so admiringly awestruck. Granted, they discover in
Ivan a certain sweetness, vulnerability and even naivete that sets
him apart from the naked ruthlessness of many who surround him,
including Enos' Charlotte, his ambitious girlfriend, but this is not
enough of a distinction; we need to sense some depth of character to
become involved with him and his sad fate.</TE>
<TE>   Not helping matters is that except for a vivid, terse Peter Weller
as a blunt-spoken, unapologetically morally repellent macho
superstar, there is no one else around Ivan who generates the
slightest interest. Hollywood, after all, is actually not in short
supply of compelling, driven personalities loaded with complexities
and contradictions.</TE>
<TE>   This is not to say that the slice of Hollywood that the filmmakers
show us seems lacking in authenticity or to overlook an appropriate
skittishness in Rose's style, but it's not enough to save "ivansxtc"
from, of all things, dullness. Hard-partying with a cornucopia of
drugs and beautiful, available women is as old as Hollywood and
therefore hardly news, and Hollywood has turned the camera on itself
many times before in far more compelling fashion. Huston is splendid,
but "ivansxtc" doesn't make the cut.</TE>

<HD>New, Offbeat Film Clips Set for Playboy Festival Screening</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jazz archivist Mark Cantor's annual film presentations may not be the
highest visibility elements of the Playboy Jazz Festival season, but
their appeal is irresistible. On Thursday night at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art's Bing Theater, Cantor will return with yet
another collection of compelling jazz clips.</LD>
<LD>   "We're going to be eclectic as always," says Cantor, "with a
strong effort to include things that haven't been seen in Los Angeles
before. One of the more interesting items is a set of pianists,
including Hazel Scott, a fine pianist who unfortunately seems to be
mentioned only in reference to the fact that she was married to
Congressman Adam Clayton Powell. We'll also have something with
Marian McPartland, as well as the world premiere of some newly
discovered Art Tatum."</LD>
<LD>   In addition, Cantor's program--as eclectic as he has
promised--will include a never-before-seen John Coltrane film clip, a
segment featuring the '30s scat singer Leo Watson, and a vocal set
with June Christy, Sarah Vaughan and Abby Lincoln.</LD>
<TE>   All this material isn't easy to uncover and Cantor has been
searching for years, far more as a labor of love than as a potential
for profit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just constantly at it," he says, "looking to find and
hopefully preserve. I maintain contacts with other collectors, other
archivists and so forth. But a lot of it is just plain old detective
work. You take a clue from one printed source, run it down, sift
through the information and find out what's germane and what's just
rumor. And often the result is something pretty exciting."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the discoveries found their way into Ken Burns' massive
jazz documentary, and Cantor regularly shows up at film festivals
around the country to display rare clips featuring famous figures
such as Coltrane, Dizzy Gillespie and Louis Armstrong, as well as the
almost forgotten Hazel Scott and Leo Watson. But he is vividly aware
that an enormous amount of valuable material may never be retrieved.</TE>
<TE>   "All sorts of gems are out there, hidden in archives and storage
vaults," he says. "And there's not a great tendency for corporations
that control those vaults to spend any time looking for jazz items,
because they're not going to make them a lot of money. But there's
another problem, too, and that's the fact that for every film I show,
there's a large handful of films that I can't share because of rights
problems."</TE>
<TE>   What Cantor does manage to share in his annual Playboy Jazz
Festival screenings is always entertaining, however. Especially when
he comes up with such offbeat items as a performance by the Joe
Mooney Quartet on "What's My Line," or a really unexpected appearance
by Clifford Brown on "The Soupy Sales Show." And Cantor promises that
Thursday's presentation will include a few other, similarly
intriguing musical surprises.</TE>
<TE>   Playboy Jazz on Film with Mark Cantor. The Bing Theater in the
L.A. County Museum of Art, 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles.
Thursday, June 13 at 7:30. Free admission, but tickets are required
and will be available from noon on June 13 at the Bing Theater box
office. Playboy Jazz Festival information: (310) 449-4070.</TE>
<TE>   Jazz Man in Need. Next week, a concert benefiting guitarist Barney
Kessel will take place in New York City with some of the jazz world's
finest guitarists expected to attend. One of the renowned figures of
the post-World War II jazz era, Kessel is ill with terminal brain
cancer. Surgery and radiation reportedly have slowed the growth of
his aggressive, inoperable tumor, but his condition requires
24-hour-a-day home care and therapy. He has no life insurance and
must use his Social Security payments to cover his rent. His wife,
Phyllis, works full time, with her entire salary allocated to
Kessel's care.</TE>
<TE>   Donations can be made directly to Kessel by sending checks or
money orders to Mrs. Phyllis Kessel, 445 North Ave., San Diego, CA
92116-3940.</TE>
<TE>   On Record. The much anticipated second set of Weather Report
recordings from Columbia Legacy has arrived. The release consists of
three original albums--"Mysterious Traveller," "Tale Spinnin'" and
"Black Market"--from 1974, 1975 and 1976.</TE>
<TE>   An additional CD, "The Best of Weather Report," includes a new
collection of 11 tracks representing the band's output between 1973
and 1980.</TE>
<TE>   It was a transitional period for this vital band in its seminal
establishment of many of the basic parameters of post-bop electronic
jazz. The most notable aspect is the growing presence of Josef
Zawinul's compositional ideas and the core importance of the complex
musical relationship between Zawinul and saxophonist-composer Wayne
Shorter.</TE>
<TE>   The notion of soloing as an intrinsic element in the writing--a
reflection of Zawinul's "We always solo, we never solo"
hypothesis--surfaces everywhere. Equally fascinating are the many
duet works between Zawinul and Shorter, especially "Blackthorn Rose,"
"Scarlet Woman" and "Five Short Stories."</TE>
<TE>   It's also intriguing to hear the impact produced by some of the
personnel changes, with bassist Miroslav Vitous replaced by Alphonso
Johnson on "Mysterious Traveller" and Johnson, in turn, being
succeeded by Jaco Pastorius on "Black Market."</TE>
<TE>   * This month, Columbia Legacy is also issuing the second set of
seven CDs drawn from the CTI jazz catalog. Like the overall CTI
catalog, it's a mixed bag of items reflecting the company's eclectic
view of jazz.</TE>
<TE>   The pick of the bunch is Freddie Hubbard's "Red Clay," an album
that the sometimes erratic trumpet player has identified as his best,
and with good reason. Performing superbly with a band that included
saxophonist Joe Henderson, keyboardist Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron
Carter and drummer Lenny White--all at the peak of their powers--the
results are marvelous, a defining example of what world-class jazz
was like in 1971. Columbia has added a previously unreleased live
version of the title track, recorded with an entirely different band.</TE>
<TE>   Guitarists George Benson ("Bad Benson"), Kenny Burrell ("God Bless
the Child") and Grant Green ("The Main Attraction") are featured on
albums that are not vital entries in any of their discographies, in
part because in each case their natural skills have been too deeply
sublimated to overly busy production.</TE>
<TE>   Hank Crawford, whose impact upon the smooth jazz/funk saxophonists
of recent decades has generally been overlooked, fares better with
"Wildflower," largely due to Bob James' compatible arrangements and
the solid backing of a group of New York City's finest studio players
of the '70s.</TE>
<TE>   Esther Phillips' "What a Diff'rence a Day Makes"  should have been
better than it is. Her stirring, soul-drenched style deserved a
better fate than having to survive a cluttered instrumental track
with a heavy emphasis upon disco dance rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   And Deodato's "Deodato 2" is only recommended to those capable of
enduring pop/rock versions of items such as "Rhapsody in Blue" and
"Nights in White Satin."</TE>
<TE>   * Klezmer music has often been described as "Jewish Blues" and
even as "Yiddish Dixieland." It's actually neither, although it isn't
hard to understand the suggested associations. It's a music in which
improvisation--often collective--plays a large role, in which dancing
rhythms are important, and which uses minor scales similar to those
commonly heard in the blues.</TE>
<TE>   Three recent Columbia Legacy recordings chronicle the early stages
of klezmer as it made its way from Europe to the New World.</TE>
<TE>   Violinist-bandleader Abe Schwartz played a vital role in that
transition, adding new instruments (the saxophone among them), and
mixing traditional tunes with updated social commentary. "The Klezmer
King" includes 25 tunes recorded from the late teens to the mid '30s,
gradually illustrating the transformation of a traditional-sounding
music into an updated sound filled with sophisticated lyrical and
musical references.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Tarras, a masterful klezmer clarinetist, was known as the
"Jewish Benny Goodman," largely because of his remarkable virtuosity
rather than as a reflection of a similarity in style. But he made
"Tanz!"--a brilliant blending of klezmer and swing rhythms--in the
mid-'50s, at a time when Elvis Presley was far more appealing to most
Jewish youngsters than the holdover music from the Old World. Too
bad, because the album is a delight, in part because of Tarras' fleet
playing, in part because of the finely crafted arrangements of Sammy
Musiker (another fine klezmer clarinetist).</TE>
<TE>   American popular music would not have been the same without the
enormous creative contributions of the writers of the Great American
Songbook, many of whom--think George Gershwin, Irving Berlin,
etc.--were Jews who were only a generation away from European
immigration.</TE>
<TE>   The two-CD set "From Avenue A to the Great White Way: Yiddish &amp;
American Popular Songs From 1914-1950" is an enticing survey of how
that music found its way into American popular culture. Among the
tracks are performances by Molly Picon, Menashe Skulnik, Emery
Deutsch, Fannie Brice, Sophie Tucker, Eddie Cantor, Al Jolson,
Mildred Bailey, Benny Goodman, Gene Krupa and, yes, Cab Calloway.</TE>

<HD>It's Not Constant Sorrow Now</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* Despite bleak career moments, bluegrass star Dan
Tyminski persevered and found success with the 'O Brother'
soundtrack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KAHN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ROANOKE, Va.</DL>
<LD>It's dinner time and Dan Tyminski of Union Station has that vacant
look college athletes sometimes get when surrounded too long by
reporters. Since recording the Grammy-winning "I Am a Man of Constant
Sorrow," bluegrass' newest star hasn't had much of a break.</LD>
<LD>   At least there's Foosball in this interview.</LD>
<LD>   "Come on ... let's see what you got," he says, brightening when
asked about the Foosball table near the entrance of the restaurant.
Tyminski, a bear of a man in a white golf cap and T-shirt, grabs the
handles and starts slapping at the cork ball with a loud, methodical
whack.</LD>
<TE>   Tyminski, it turns out, is a Foosball fanatic. Before joining
Alison Krauss, he used to spend as many as 60 hours a week hovering
over the little painted men, dreaming of someday becoming a champion
Foosballer.</TE>
<TE>   "I was probably more serious about Foosball than I have ever been
about music," Tyminski says.</TE>
<TE>   Those days are over. After years of self-doubt when Tyminski
almost quit the music business, the prolific picker from Vermont says
he can finally relax. The only career moves he worries about now are
what kind of music to play next.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were going to go on a full-fledged solo career, I'd say this
is the best opportunity I've had and will ever have," he says,
pausing for a moment. "But that's not where my heart lies. I really
love what I do with Alison and Union Station."</TE>
<TE>   Tyminski, 34, has come a long way since growing up in Rutland, Vt.
The small manufacturing community in the Green Mountains is better
known for its nearby ski resorts and marble quarries than for
bluegrass.</TE>
<TE>   He learned about the twangy mountain music from his parents,
Stanley and Patricia Tyminski, who were nuts about it. Dan and his
older brother, Stan, spent much of their childhood driving around the
country to see such big-time bluegrass acts as Paul Silvias, Smokey
Green and Bob French.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't long before they picked up guitars themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been playing as long as I can remember," Tyminski recalls.
As a child, he learned to carry a tune on his brother's mandolin. By
his mid-teens, he was picking banjo for Stan's Green Mountain
Bluegrass band.</TE>
<TE>   "He was awesome ... wasn't trying to play like his hero or
anything," says Tim Austin, a longtime friend and founding member of
the Lonesome River Band.</TE>
<TE>   But for two boys reared north of the Mason-Dixon line, the
pressure to satisfy the hard-core traditionalists of bluegrass was
immense.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted so badly to sound like an authentic Southern bluegrass
band," Tyminski says. "We played a certain way and made sure our song
selection was accepted by a certain group of people."</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere along the way, he figured it out. When he sings,
Tyminski's voice has that hardscrabble sound that's much more eastern
Kentucky than Yankee Vermont.</TE>
<TE>   "People who are not from the mountains, you know, they might speak
their words not as good," says bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley, who
recorded a popular version of "I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow" in
1959. "But he's got a good lick on the guitar. And the sound he's
got, that's fine."</TE>
<TE>   After auditioning two other banjo players, Austin persuaded
Tyminski in 1988 to move to Roanoke and join Lonesome River.</TE>
<TE>   To make ends meet, Tyminski delivered room service at the Hotel
Roanoke and turned a wrench at auto repair shops. But after a few
years, it didn't seem as though the band was going anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a point when I woke up with my wife and we were three
months behind in our rent, and there was a stack of bills," Tyminski
says. "I thought, you know, this is not right for me. I moved back to
Vermont."</TE>
<TE>   But with new members Sammy Shelor and Ronnie Bowman, Lonesome
River's 1991 release, "Carrying the Tradition," soared to the top of
bluegrass charts, winning the International Bluegrass Music Assn.'s
album of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The group was hopping, and Tyminski came back to Roanoke. He still
wasn't happy, though. Lonesome River's harmonies forced him to sing
at an uncomfortable pitch. In 1994, he called the band members
together and told them about his final move: He was headed to Union
Station and Krauss.</TE>
<TE>   "It was tough on our friendship," Austin says. "But [Alison] was a
national act who was in a position to pay money and have insurance. I
think he made a wise move."</TE>
<TE>   Along with Tyminski's Grammy this year, Union Station won two,
including best bluegrass album for "New Favorite."</TE>
<TE>   After one game of Foosball, Tyminski sits back down. His shot was
a bit off.</TE>
<TE>   "The table's too light," he says.</TE>
<TE>   With their Grammys in tow, Krauss and Union Station will visit 41
cities starting June 25, along with such bluegrass stars as Ralph
Stanley, for the "Down From the Mountain" tour. Krauss also plans to
record the band's first live album this summer, and Tyminski has
started work on a second solo album (his first was in 2000).</TE>
<TE>   With the remaining time, he stays home these days with his wife,
Elise, and three children in Ferrum, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "This year is for me," he says. "If there is a day free from our
tour schedule, I'm crossing it out as free time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The "Down From the Mountain" tour will play the Greek Theatre on
Aug. 1.</TE>

<HD>Lives Collide in 'Code Unknown'</HD>
<DH>Michael Haneke's provocative new film interweaves the lives
of three people, and as usual the filmmaker has many things on his
mind.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Haneke has created a terrific opening sequence for his "Code
Unknown," one that's intricate yet seemingly spontaneous. It quickly
sweeps up viewers into several stories. A teenager, Jean (Alexandre
Hamidi), freshly arrived in Paris, catches up with his brother's
lover, Anne (Juliette Binoche), in the street before he reaches her
apartment. He has run away from home, a farm where he lives with his
single father (Sepp Bierbichler) who expects his son to spend his
life working alongside him. Anne, a busy actress, is sympathetic but
tells him he's got to stay with his father until he comes of age.</LD>
<LD>   While Anne, who has given Jean a key to her apartment, rushes off
to an appointment, Jean, frustrated and angry over the future his
father has mapped out for him, tosses a piece of crumpled paper in
the direction of a woman beggar, Maria (Luminata Gheorghiu), sitting
on the sidewalk. A young black man, Amadou (Ona Lu Yenke), witnesses
the thoughtless action. Enraged by Jean's lack of respect for Maria,
Amadou catches up with him and a hassle ensues. Amadou is arrested;
the police aren't at all interested in the circumstances of the ugly
skirmish.</LD>
<TE>   There's no way of knowing at this point, but this ugly incident
enables Haneke to pursue the stories of Amadou and Maria as well as
that of Anne, a lovely, thoughtful woman, clearly a talented actress
with bright prospects. We get glimpses of her at work on a creepy
thriller movie, auditioning for a role in a stage production of
"Twelfth Night" and dubbing what may be yet another movie. She and
her lover, Georges (Thierry Neuvic), have precariously little time
together, for Georges is a war photographer often on assignment and
is just back briefly from Kosovo. Haneke has a sure way with
actors--allowing them to seem to be living rather than acting their
roles--that matches his ability to capture the rhythms and routines
of everyday life with a graceful, unstudied ease.</TE>
<TE>   Haneke cuts back and forth among Anne and Maria and Amadou. The
incident in the street results in Maria being deported to Romania,
where she is happy to be reunited with her family and friends. Yet
she knows that she will eventually try to smuggle herself back into
France, where even as a Paris street beggar she makes more money to
support her family than if she were to stay home. Amadou, we
discover, is a teacher at a school for deaf children where his little
sister is one of his pupils. Amadou is charming and sophisticated,
but at every turn he and his family feel the sting of racism, real or
imagined.</TE>
<TE>   Haneke, maker of the recent and extraordinary "The Piano Teacher,"
with Isabelle Huppert in the title role, has a lot on his mind, but
he evokes rather than declares his thoughts. His observation of daily
life in a great metropolis at a time of a proliferating
multicultural, multilingual population with its resulting tensions is
acute and suggests how limited we are in our knowledge of the lives
of others. He has said that he also became concerned with the
limitations of cinema, yet illuminates beautifully the lives of his
people with an eye for the revealing nuance and detail.</TE>
<TE>   He calls "Code Unknown" a collection of "incomplete tales of
several journeys." In doing so, he raises consciousness about how
easy it is for us to ignore others or make snap judgments that have
little bearing on what their lives are really like. To achieve this
in the form of a most absorbing film is no small accomplishment on
the part of the always-provocative Haneke.</TE>

<DH>Tired of seeing white colleagues 'painted down,' a black
stuntman pulled off his toughest trick: pushing for change in
Hollywood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TODD LONGWELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pasted in a corner of Eddie Smith's scrapbook is a small, yellowed
newspaper clipping from 1969 telling of a helicopter crash on the set
of a war movie in which a pilot and two stuntmen "escaped injury."
The movie was "MASH"; Smith was one of the stuntmen; and as he walks
across the den of his Culver City home on this spring day more than
30 years later, he still has a limp from that accident. Although he's
free to grouse about the pain now, back then he held his tongue.</LD>
<LD>   "I couldn't mess it up for the rest of the group, man," says
Smith, 78. "We fought too hard. We had to show ourselves."</LD>
<LD>   The group he speaks of is the Black Stuntmen's Assn., or BSA,
which he co-founded in 1967 with African American film extras,
horsemen and athletes. They risked their necks in front of the
cameras and behind the scenes, fighting to break through the color
barrier in the stunt business.</LD>
<TE>   "Our thought was that you'd have to be better than good to get the
job," says the group's co-founder, Henry Kingi, 58. "All they needed
was to have one of us mess up so they could say, 'See, they don't
know what they're doing.' "</TE>
<TE>   Smith brought together several old BSA members at his house last
month to talk about their trials and triumphs. A few days later, "The
2nd Annual World Stunt Awards" (which aired May 31 on ABC) would be
taped in Santa Monica. There were no awards for any BSA members, and
no one here is complaining. Instead of bitter railings against
injustices they faced, the bulk of the conversation is devoted to
fond memories and former running mates ("Whatever happened to ol'
Half-Foot?"). But their nonchalance belies the importance of their
struggle--a lost piece of civil rights and Hollywood history.</TE>
<TE>   Actor-director Sidney Poitier, who worked with black stuntmen on
"Uptown Saturday Night" and other films, says the BSA made a
contribution "that is all too often not remembered or recognized by
the industry. A lot of the guys, like myself, we've moved on in
years, and some of them have retired by now and some have gone on to
other things. But they were quite a force, and they were substantive
in their skills and their contributions."</TE>
<TE>   In the first few decades of the film business, whenever an actor
of color needed to be doubled for a dangerous action sequence, a
white stuntman would be coated with the appropriate shade of makeup.
As the civil rights movement gained momentum in the '60s and blacks
and other minorities were featured more prominently in movies and on
TV, the practice--known as a "paint-down"--became even more glaring.
Not only was it insulting, but it also robbed nonwhite performers of
a potentially rich source of income, a fact readily apparent to
show-business journeyman Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Smith had been kicking around Hollywood since 1955 as a film extra
and freelance TV news cameraman covering breaking stories for local
stations in areas where most white newsmen feared to tread.</TE>
<TE>   Working on the sets of films and TV shows, he noticed the
discrepancy between his earnings as an extra and those of white
stuntmen: "A white stunt guy would say, 'I had a pretty good week. I
guess I'll go down to Palm Springs.' And I'd think, 'I ain't made
enough money to take the Red Car to Watts.' "</TE>
<TE>   The catalyst for the black stuntman group came on the set of the
1963 film "It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World" when Smith witnessed a white
stuntman being painted to double black actor Eddie "Rochester"
Anderson for the climactic struggle. Smith complained to director
Stanley Kramer.</TE>
<TE>   "Eddie asked, 'Why isn't a black stuntman doubling Rochester?' "
Kingi says, "and Kramer said, 'Well, find me one.' And Eddie said,
'Uh, OK.' "</TE>
<TE>   "Man, I couldn't get no brothers nowhere," recalls Smith, who
officially retired from stunt work in 1996 but still works regularly
as a recruiter of African American extras for film and TV projects.
"But I told him, 'Next time I'll be able to supply you with what you
want.' "</TE>
<TE>   Recruiting, Then Tutoring Stuntmen</TE>
<TE>   The BSA didn't actually come into existence until 1967, when Smith
approached Kingi and other friends who rode in a re-creation of the
all-black U.S. 10th Cavalry Unit, known as the Buffalo Soldiers, and
asked if they'd like to be movie stuntmen.</TE>
<TE>   "We were doing stunts off of horses and fights already," says Len
Glascow, leader of the Los Angeles chapter of the Buffalo Soldiers.
"Eddie said, 'You guys might as well join.' " Augmented by an
assortment of extras and former athletes, the future stuntmen trained
strenuously on weekends, riding motorcycles, learning to fall off
horses and piloting rental cars through traffic cones. At Athens Park
in South L.A., the group practiced fight scenes and high falls off
backstops and bleachers onto mattresses.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd look across the street and there'd always be cops in
unmarked police cars watching," Kingi says, laughing. "We figured
they thought we were another Black Panther group forming."</TE>
<TE>   They were helped by Glenn Wilder and Ronnie Rondell, two top young
white stuntmen of that era who in 1970 co-founded Stunts Unlimited as
a more forward-looking alternative to the older Stuntmen's Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "Ronnie and I spent five or six weekends showing them how to do
fights, falls and car hits," Wilder says. "... A lot of the
established stunt people were not too happy with us because of that,
but we didn't care."</TE>
<TE>   No matter how hard BSA members trained, white stunt coordinators
who controlled the hiring were still reluctant to give them work.</TE>
<TE>   Matters came to a head on the set of the Warner Bros. western
"Skin Game" (1971) when a white stuntman was called in to double
African American Louis Gossett Jr. Smith found out and argued that
there was a black man named Tony Brubaker (later a top stuntman) more
than capable of handling it.</TE>
<TE>   The NAACP, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the
Screen Actors Guild were soon drawn into the controversy. In May
1971, Warner Bros. agreed not only to hire black stunt people to
double black actors but also to include black stuntmen in all scenes
involving general stunt work. They also invited members of the black
stunt community to train with experienced white stuntmen on the
studio lot and at Randall Ranch in Newhall.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of the white stunt establishment was so welcoming,
according to Smith and other BSA members. Because of the group's
activism, members were branded as troublemakers, and the jobs they
fought for often went to black stuntmen who didn't make waves.</TE>
<TE>   "They resented the fact that we were taking money from their
pockets," Kingi says of the white stuntmen. "They also didn't like
taking orders."</TE>
<TE>   Wilder agrees that the established white stuntmen were angry about
losing work to black stuntmen, not to mention white stuntwomen, who
at the time were waging their own battle to get the men to stop
donning wigs and dresses and to let them double their own gender.
Three decades later, the race issue remains hard to unravel. Many of
the major players from the "Skin Game" era are dead, and the ones
still alive are fearful of being considered--justly or
unjustly--racists.</TE>
<TE>   The wave of action-oriented blaxploitation films in the early
'70s, along with the overall improvement of race relations, created
more job opportunities for BSA members. But Smith, who scored a
prestigious gig as a stunt coordinator on the 1973 James Bond film
"Live and Let Die," still kept an eye out for injustice.</TE>
<TE>   "We were members of everything ... PUSH, CORE, the NAACP," Kingi
says. "Eddie would call studios and say he was the Black National
Congress leader of the African Society of Whatever-It-Was and he'd
heard there was a problem, then we would go in as the group and
follow up on it. Every time Eddie would tell us, 'We've got another
situation,' we'd say, 'OK, who are we today, Eddie?' "</TE>
<TE>   In the ensuing years, BSA members such as Alan Oliney, Alex Brown,
Ernie Robinson, Smith and Kingi found consistent work as stuntmen and
stunt coordinators. As their personal fortunes improved, the group
drifted apart, but they still keep in touch today and, although
paint-downs do still occur on occasion, Kingi is proud of how much
has changed.</TE>
<TE>   Says Kingi: "We were either going to do or die. We were not going
to sell out or be bought out. No one said, 'I'll take this and you
get nothing.' That's what was so good about it: We all stuck
together."</TE>

<HD>Network Is Criticized for Show on Gay Parents</HD>
<DH>Television* Nickelodeon program draws the ire of the
Traditional Values Coalition. O'Donnell, Falwell to be guests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Children's cable network Nickelodeon has drawn fire from a
conservative group over an upcoming "Nick News" special that will
explore the issue of gay parenting, with comic Rosie O'Donnell and
the Rev. Jerry Falwell among the participants.</LD>
<LD>   "Nick News Special Edition: My Family Is Different" is scheduled
to run in prime time on June 18 and will examine "issues related to
diversity, tolerance and respect, particularly to kids of same-sex
parented families," according to the network's announcement.</LD>
<LD>   Linda Ellerbee will host the half-hour program, which also
promises to provide viewpoints from those who disapprove of gay
parenting, among them Falwell.</LD>
<TE>   News of the special, which was taped Wednesday, prompted criticism
from the Washington, D.C.-based Traditional Values Coalition, an
interdenominational public policy organization. Basing its criticism
on "inside sources," the group's executive director, Andrea Lafferty,
described the special as "pro-homosexual propaganda" and accused
Nickelodeon of ignoring objections from parents, saying the channel
is "no longer a safe haven" for children's viewing.</TE>
<TE>   As with other "Nick News" specials, Ellerbee will approach the
subject from a child's perspective, discussing the topic with a small
group of kids in addition to interviewing those on both sides of the
issue, including Falwell and O'Donnell.</TE>
<TE>   Ellerbee stressed Thursday that the special was not a debate about
homosexuality but rather about tolerance and diversity. "It's about
not name-calling. It's about stopping violence," she said, adding
that the Traditional Values Coalition had been asked to participate
but declined.</TE>
<TE>   The host also denied that O'Donnell attacked Christians during the
taping, as the coalition asserted in a press release, reading from a
transcript quoting the talk-show host as saying, "I am telling you
there are Christians who don't believe homosexuality is wrong."</TE>
<TE>   "I really wish they would just watch the show before they make up
their minds," Ellerbee said.</TE>
<TE>   Lafferty acknowledged that her organization was approached but
said she felt the issue was "not appropriate for 8-year-old kids" and
pertained to such a small percentage of children that it is "very
clear what Nickelodeon's agenda is."</TE>
<TE>   Past specials under the award-winning "Nick News" banner have
focused on AIDS, racism and, most recently, the Sept. 11 terror
attacks and children of Afghanistan. Ellerbee said she is planning
further installments under the heading "My Family Is Different,"
dealing with such areas as mixed-race children and children of
divorce.</TE>
<TE>   "I watch 'Nick News' with my kids," noted Joan Garry, executive
director of the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, who said
it is important for Nickelodeon to devote time to such discussions.
"This is a show about broadening kids' understanding of a variety of
social issues ... and kids live in a world with an increasing number
of gay and lesbian people in their lives."</TE>
<TE>   O'Donnell, who publicly acknowledged that she is a lesbian earlier
this year as her popular daytime talk show came to an end, has been
featured on Nickelodeon frequently, recently hosting the channel's
Kids Choice Awards.</TE>
<TE>   Nickelodeon is television's most popular network among children.
It is owned by Viacom, which is developing a channel devoted to gay
and lesbian viewers.</TE>

<HD>More Than Just a Numbers Game</HD>
<DH>Like 'A Beautiful Mind,' 'Proof' explores mathematics,
mental illness and family dysfunction. But it works best as a
detective story.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEAN MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Auburn's much-honored play "Proof" puts a contemporary spin on
the cautionary adage "A mind is a terrible thing to waste."</LD>
<LD>   In Auburn's Tony- and Pulitzer-winning drama of last year, which
arrived at the Wilshire Theatre on Tuesday night for a two-week road
show engagement, the mind of a young mathematician has gone not
uncultivated but unrecognized. Very much to the point, the young
mathematician, the precocious daughter of a famous University of
Chicago math professor, has lived in self-imposed anonymity to the
age of 25, discouraged by the gender bias in a field in which most of
the heavy thinking, we learn, has been done by men in their 20s. Men
like her father, who, by the way, following his breakthrough theorem,
lost his mind. Ah, there's the rub.</LD>
<LD>   "Proof" is a four-character detective story with a feminist slant
set in a world made up in equal parts of dysfunctional family,
mathematics and mental illness. Auburn has a sharp sense of humor
that manages to divert us regularly from the grim backdrop to such a
tale and that supports the play's final lunge at hope. But the mood
is set by the depressive and nearly catatonic Catherine, played here
by Chelsea Altman under the direction of Daniel Sullivan, who cast
Mary Louise Parker and later Jennifer Jason Leigh in the role in New
York.</LD>
<TE>   Catherine is a big role and a tough one, requiring an actress to
make herself understood while often mumbling dismissively, not to
mention winning our sympathy from a long-standing slouch position
that represents her sulking withdrawal from life. Altman is somewhat
successful at this without ever overcoming the role's built-in
obstacles. (The same was true for Leigh, whom I saw play the role in
New York.)</TE>
<TE>   Robert Foxworth, the accomplished stage actor best known,
unfortunately, for his stint on "Falcon Crest," is terrific as
Robert, the benighted genius father. Showing here what he is capable
of in more challenging material (albeit in limited stage time),
Foxworth makes all too real the scary instability of his character,
downshifting in the same scene from the hum of paternal warmth to the
stammering lower gears of madness without losing his grip on the guy
for a second. With bearded professorial gentility, he convinces us
how much he loves Catherine, yet we accept the truth of her claim
that he constructed elegant proofs based on aliens sending him coded
messages from outer space. In a flashback a period of recovery, he
reaches a level of ebullience that is heartbreaking in its
misrepresentation of what's really going on inside his head.</TE>
<TE>   In the year of the Oscar-winning "A Beautiful Mind," here is yet
another view of high-level mathematics cracking someone's head. But
in this case, the victim not only doesn't recover, but sets a
terrifying example for his daughter, who's understandably afraid of
her own budding intellect.</TE>
<TE>   "Proof" humanizes mathematics even while it raises the troubling
specter of what can happen to a brain stretched over 40-page proofs
of prime-number theory for days at a time. Despite all the abstruse
calculations, the dynamics of the play are purely personal and staged
on one of noted designer John Lee Beatty's sumptuous domestic
tableaux, this one the back porch of a neglected stately home that
looks as if it has not been painted since the first Richard Daley was
mayor of Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   We find that Catherine has been the unhappy caretaker of the old
homestead, as well as of her father since his bout with insanity. The
play opens with the two of them talking earnestly in a scene soon
revealed to be taking place only in her mind. It's set on the day of
his funeral, which, in a familiar scenario, occasions a reunion of
family members and friends, most of whom we never see. We hear the
noise drifting out to the porch after hours and learn that
mathematicians and physicists are--maybe surprisingly, maybe not--a
drunken and drugged bunch. But nice.</TE>
<TE>   We do see Catherine's estranged and meddling sister, Claire (Tasha
Lawrence), who is everything Catherine is not--an ambitious New York
careerist soon to be married. And we see Hal (Stephen Kunken), a
bright doctoral candidate in mathematics who studied under the great
man and is now poring over the professor's notebooks for anything
important that might yet be unknown to the world.</TE>
<TE>   Hal's eyes are also trained on Catherine, and in the drunken
exuberance of the wake, the two fall for each other with untidy
consequences.</TE>
<TE>   What is untidy emerges from the play's sudden transformation into
a detective story at the end of Act 1, when Hal discovers a
magnificent unknown proof in the hidden notebooks.</TE>
<TE>   Did the professor secretly write this after everyone assumed he
had lost his marbles? And if not him, then who? Surely not Catherine,
who dropped out of Northwestern in her freshman year and who until
this point in the play has exhibited all the intellectual spark of a
Grateful Dead groupie.</TE>
<TE>   One of Auburn's neatest conceits is to have fashioned a problem in
which there is no proof of the origin of the "proof." The play's
title is turned back on itself.</TE>
<TE>   While the mystery is being worked out, the characters reveal the
rest of what they have to tell us about themselves. Claire, although
well intentioned, is a symbol of all that is empty about bourgeois
respectability, a Wall Street drone whose idea of self-improvement
tends toward better hair conditioners. She wants to take Catherine
back to New York and possibly commit her to long-term psychiatric
care. Hal, smitten with Catherine, is the geek as non-geek. His
mission is to show us that math nerds are worthy human beings who
even play in bad rock and roll bands and "get laid with surprising
frequency," as he informs Catherine. Auburn and the actors, Lawrence
and Kunken, have some fun with these details and keep the play from
sinking into an emotional morass.</TE>
<TE>   "Proof" is, in the end, a father-daughter saga working out some of
the usual conflicts of that primary relationship, but the difference
here is that the relationship carries with it a most unusual curse
that must be exorcised if we are to feel by curtain time that
mathematics is really quite beautiful, after all, and not a dark art
to be practiced only at great personal risk.</TE>
<TE>   Auburn's story works well as a page-turning mystery, but the
payoff doesn't carry much of a wallop unless the you can reconfigure
the annoying character of Catherine in your head and decide that her
lifetime supply of self-involved angst is really a kind of heroism
after all.</TE>

<LD>   Bleeping 'Jesus' Triggers Public Complaints</LD>
<LD>   ABC says it edited the word "Jesus" out of its daytime program
"The View" so viewers wouldn't be offended. But for many, it had the
opposite effect--drawing the ire of the Rev. Jerry Falwell, some
conservative media watchdogs and about 100 letters of complaint.</LD>
<TE>   "It is political correctness run amok," said Elizabeth Swasey,
spokeswoman for the Media Research Center.</TE>
<TE>   The bleeping incident occurred on the May 23 program, when
Meredith Vieira noted that the daily weigh-ins of her dieting
co-host, Joy Behar, had ended. "Yes, and thank you, thank you, Jesus,
is all I have to say," Behar replied. Though her words were aired
live in much of the country, they were edited out when ABC broadcast
the show on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   ABC spokeswoman Julie Hoover said the use ran afoul of network
standards. The network has no problem with Jesus Christ's name if it
is used in a "prayerful and respectful manner," she explained, but it
does not allow Jesus' name to be used in an exclamation.</TE>

<TE>   Bolshoi Theatre to Get Cash Infusion</TE>
<TE>   The Russian government is pumping $180 million into the
restoration of Moscow's world-famous Bolshoi Theatre after a decade
of money troubles and artistic decline, the BBC reports.</TE>
<TE>   Four and a half years of rebuilding work are due to begin in 2003,
the venue's general director, Anatoli Iksanov, told the Itar-Tass
news agency. Performances are to continue during renovations, with
the theater closing only a few months during the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Described by President Vladimir Putin as "the symbol of Russian
culture," the Moscow landmark celebrated its 225th anniversary in
2001. Since the collapse of communism, government funding has
decreased.</TE>

<TE>   Irish Eyes to Smile on Mills, McCartney?</TE>
<TE>   An international media horde gathered Thursday at a remote 17th
century Irish castle hotel, where the owner announced that Paul
McCartney and his fiance, Heather Mills, would have their wedding
reception next week.</TE>
<TE>   "We are told vaguely it is next Tuesday, but it is all secret. I
have to keep it dead-secret," said Sir John Leslie, owner of Castle
Leslie, an offbeat luxury hotel in County Monaghan bordering Northern
Ireland. "They might do something at the last minute or change it.
You never know."</TE>
<TE>   McCartney, Leslie said, had visited the hotel last year "and he
had a look around." The venue boasts about 1,000 acres of grounds, a
helicopter landing pad and a lake with boats. Preparations for a big
party were evident inside the Castle Leslie grounds.</TE>
<TE>   McCartney and Mills, for their part, remain mum about their plans.</TE>
<TE>   Is Security to Blame for Concert Death?</TE>
<TE>   Chris Gratton, a tour manager for the rock-rap band Limp Bizkit,
blamed concert organizers Thursday for the death of a young fan at a
concert in Sydney, Australia, last year.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Michalik died after suffering a heart attack when she was
caught in a crowd crush during a performance by Limp Bizkit. Her
death could have been prevented if promoters had stopped the show,
Gratton told an inquest in Sydney, but security staff "just stood
back and did nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Gratton rejected claims that lead singer Fred Durst provoked the
crowd by screaming obscenities at them and pointing fingers. Durst is
scheduled to give testimony via a video link from Los Angeles on June
17.</TE>
<TE>   Senator Boycotts Backstreet Boy</TE>
<TE>   Backstreet Boys member Kevin Richardson hit a wrong note with a
Republican senator when the singer urged Congress on Thursday to
crack down on coal mining pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio Sen. George Voinovich said he boycotted a meeting of the
Senate environment subcommittee to protest testimony by
Richardson--founder of an environmental education group called Just
Within Reach--about the impact of mountaintop mining in his home
state of Kentucky. "I am not a scientist, but I do know what I've
seen on flights over the coalfields," Richardson testified.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic leaders of the panel invited Richardson "to make a
media stunt out of what is a serious issue," a Voinovich spokesman
complained.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Hugh Jackman ("Swordfish," "X-Men") will star in a new musical,
"The Boy From Oz," based on the rise to fame of the late Australian
entertainer Peter Allen. The project, due to premiere on Broadway in
September 2003, will feature music by Allen and a book by Martin
Sherman ("Bent").... Mel Gibson, who plays a cop in the "Lethal
Weapon" movies, has given a $10,000 college bond to the stepdaughter
of David March, a sheriff's deputy shot in the line of duty in
Irwindale on April 29.... Showtime has greenlighted a two-hour pilot
of "The Ranch," a series about Nevada women working at a legal
bordello near Reno. ... Tickets for KROQ-FM's 10th annual Weenie
Roast concert, which will take place June 15, go on sale at noon
Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Getting at the Partial Truth of What We See</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEAH OLLMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The new work by Raul Cordero at Iturralde Gallery reminds us with
canny humor of something we already know--that we cannot trust
images, even photographs, to deliver the truth.</LD>
<LD>   Partial truth is the best we're going to get. It's going to
masquerade as the real, authoritative thing, and most of the time
that's how we'll passively accept it.</LD>
<LD>   The everyday construction of meaning through the manipulation of
images usually merits a darker warning than Cordero issues here.
After all, political power is at stake, public opinion is at risk.
The histories of countries, empires even, owe much to the basic
tenets that Cordero exposes, having to do with how very malleable
meaning can be. They are propaganda's tools in trade.</LD>
<TE>   Cordero, though, makes us laugh, and reminds us further that, in
this case, the playful and the dire aren't opposites but simply two
points on a single continuum. In "The Zooming Experience," one of
three groups of work on view, Cordero illustrates the concept that
closing in on a subject doesn't necessarily clarify it.</TE>
<TE>   It might even obliterate it, as happens in a short video, which
starts with an establishing shot of three eggs resting in a row. The
camera zooms in on one of the eggs and keeps zooming in until the
white of the shell fills the entire screen. All sense of the subject
is lost. A sequence using fragments of a single painted landscape,
and a lever-operated "Zoom Machine" demonstrate a related effect.</TE>
<TE>   With tongue in cheek, Cordero works like a teacher, employing a
variety of materials to explain a single lesson. In "Stages," he uses
Polaroids, lenticular images, paintings, writing, mirrors and
souvenir statuettes to "construct" the Eiffel Tower. In a montage of
Polaroids--shot not of the real tower, but of a 19th century
photograph of it--Cordero builds the landmark methodically, image by
image. In a multi-panel painting, the tower rises, stage by stage,
from one panel to the next; mounted beneath the paintings, Polaroids
(famous for their own ability to make images emerge from blankness)
show the construction in reverse order, as dissolution.</TE>
<TE>   In the third body of work, "Shopworn," Cordero presents what
appears to be physical evidence of an urban legend recounted in one
of Dave Hickey's writings about Las Vegas. In the center of the
gallery stands a dress form in black cocktail dress with Hickey's
text beneath it on a brass plaque--the brass coyly reinforcing the
story's presumed authenticity.</TE>
<TE>   The tale tells of a dress bought for a prostitute and sold by her
the next morning, after which it was bought by another john and sold
again, and so on some 500 times. In addition to showing us a
dress--the actual dress, we assume--Cordero surrounds it with
photographs of women (prostitutes, we infer) wearing it as they
smoke, apply makeup and lean out of a car.</TE>
<TE>   Do any of these elements document the story of the dress? Probably
not. Do they give persuasive evidence that the story is true and not
just a myth? Definitely not.</TE>
<TE>   What is certain is that Cordero is both clever and technically
agile, able to exploit the familiar idioms of any number of visual
genres. His entertaining lessons can easily be applied to other
circumstances in which image manipulation carries more daunting
consequences. (Cordero is from Cuba, so political interpretations
cling to his work, whether desired or not.) The show leaves us with
the obvious revelation that all images are propositions, to be
accepted or rejected. We accept Cordero's for the lies they tell and
the truths they teach.</TE>

<TE>   Aldo Salvadori and His Women</TE>
<TE>   Modigliani, Matisse and Degas all make appearances in Aldo
Salvadori's lovely show at Double Vision Gallery--not in their own
right but as influences assimilated into Salvadori's gentle
Modernism.</TE>
<TE>   Although his name is unfamiliar in the U.S., Salvadori, 97, has
enjoyed a long and fruitful career in his native Italy. He began
exhibiting drawings at the Venice Biennale in 1930 and continued
showing there into the 1950s, and throughout Italy up to the present.
In addition to painting and drawing, Salvadori has made prints
illustrating volumes by Mallarme, Rimbaud and Petrarch. The Double
Vision show includes prints, oils and pastels, all depicting
women--seated, reclining, nude and clothed, all absorbed in quiet
contemplation.</TE>
<TE>   Modigliani comes through in the eyes, in their upward tilt and in
the frequent elongation of the face, its features abbreviated to
shorthand dashes. That reduction to essentials also brings to mind
Matisse, especially in the 1967 oil painting "Little Nude." The
woman, reclining with hands joined above her head, has a sketchy
immediacy, and her slightly arching form reads as one of several
stripes of color in the patchwork composition.</TE>
<TE>   The flattened space that Degas borrowed from Japanese woodblock
prints makes its way into a few of Salvadori's works as well,
especially in the pastel, "Nude at a Writing Table" (circa 1983), in
which an expanse of empty space rises behind the figure and elegantly
frames her.</TE>
<TE>   One fine still life here hints of Salvadori's broader range. Its
slightly skewed perspective--coffeepot seen from the side, plate of
fruit seen from above--animates the otherwise hushed scene painted in
all the nuanced colors of dust. Comparisons to Giorgio Morandi spring
to mind (the two artists were longtime friends), but as with the
other artists whose impact is felt here, Salvadori stays recognizably
apart, emboldened perhaps by their influence but not subsumed by it.
He has a grace all his own that leaves a pleasant first impression.</TE>
<TE>   Double Vision Gallery, 5820 Wilshire Blvd., L.A. (323) 936-1553,

<TE>   A Visual Poet of the Outer and Inner Worlds</TE>
<TE>   Another artist once called photographer Jose Figueroa a "hunter of
images." No, he says on the DVD playing along with his show at
Couturier Gallery, that's not me. I'm a "searcher of essences."</TE>
<TE>   True enough. Figueroa shoots not with aggressive territoriality or
the aim to possess, but with tenderness and generosity, driven by the
desire to explore his internal as much as his external world. One of
Cuba's most prominent photographers, Figueroa, 55, has worked as a
photojournalist, but mostly as a visual poet, framing rich,
suggestive details of the quotidian world.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1960s, he served as a studio assistant to Alberto
Korda, whose portrait of Che Guevara has become a universal icon of
heroic fortitude. In one of the series here, Figueroa chronicles the
various guises in which "The Image" appears--on a limited-edition
cigarette lighter, a rapper's T-shirt, the face of a watch,
billboards, handbills, posters, burned onto a piece of wood and sold
alongside crosses and prayer beads outside a Havana cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   Another series tracks the sights and personalities of a single
lively, slightly dilapidated street in Havana. Figueroa homes in on
details to characterize the whole. An old gas station sign, its
advertising nameplate missing, rises like a challenge against the
stark sky, an abandoned hoop waiting to be filled. A boy, sitting on
a slab of pavement, plays quietly by himself, the smooth curve of his
naked back stretched and straightened to maturity in his shadow. An
old Buick parked on the street decays like overripe fruit, its peel
warping and loosening.</TE>
<TE>   The subjects Figueroa photographs are rarely remarkable, but they
are consistently poignant, particularly in their embodiment of time's
passage.</TE>
<TE>   "State of Mind," the third series excerpted here, is the most
diaristic of the three. Figueroa describes the images as
self-portraits, although he hasn't aimed his camera at himself.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the six pictures represents a window in a city he visited
over the last 20 years. One taken at the Berlin Wall in 1990, before
it had completely come down, shows a window filled with bricks and
covered with iron bars. In Angola, where Figueroa worked as a war
correspondent in the early 1980s, he photographed a building whose
windows seem moot, the walls are so pocked with holes and the ceiling
seemingly missing altogether.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent image from this series shows a window with its
shade drawn, shutting out the brightness of the day. Knowing it was
made in New York on Sept. 11 gives its dark interiority great
resonance.</TE>
<TE>   The "State of Mind" series illustrates most explicitly what is
implicit throughout. For Figueroa, looking out is just another way of
looking in.</TE>

<TE>   Color and Motion Consort in Oils</TE>
<TE>   The 1960s "finish fetish" look, slick and pristine, has its
adherents still, decades after surfboard surfaces and gleaming
automotive paint jobs first showed up on the walls of Southern
California galleries. Its countercurrent, though, runs even stronger.</TE>
<TE>   A fetish for the unfinished, the raw and intentionally unrefined,
traces its roots to the gestural immediacy of Abstract Expressionism,
if not further. Arron Sturgeon, a young L.A. painter showing at
William Turner Gallery, lands soundly in the latter camp.</TE>
<TE>   Sturgeon paints in oil and wax, although "paint" is a catchall
verb for the scraping, rubbing, dragging and abrading he does to
forge surfaces that look like foundations for something to come--or
remnants of something that was. Most of the paintings are 2 or 3 feet
square, with a drab base color like that of an aged plaster wall.</TE>
<TE>   With the zeal of an excavator, Sturgeon reveals passages where
motion and colors like mauve, rust, sunflower, indigo and grape
consort to wide-ranging effect. Often he drags a thick swath of paint
across the canvas, its colors mixing as they go. The striated path
loops and bends, sometimes stuttering in the manner of Gerhard
Richter's lush contrivances.</TE>
<TE>   Scabby spots neighbor more luminous stretches, where Sturgeon has
capitalized on the translucency of wax. He musters a huge tactile
range in this work and occasionally the canvases get muddy.
Generally, Sturgeon pulls back just before the integrity of the
texture dissolves, and it's this balance between control and abandon
that invigorates the work.</TE>
<TE>   Circles, rectangles and lines painted in solid colors temper the
chaos. They don't impose order, but suggest the possibility of its
coexistence with the spontaneity that otherwise prevails. Hard edges
and soft fluid space find their place in these works, which offer
more gratification from close-up than from a distanced, all-over
view.</TE>
<TE>   Painterly surrender certainly wins out over geometric order. But
Sturgeon seems to relish a certain hybrid quality, exemplified by the
title, if not the surface, of one of his best paintings here: "Joy
Science."</TE>

<HD>Sci-Fi Tag Team Rolls Out a Galactic Welcome Mat</HD>
<DH>The hip space sagas 'Stargate SG-1' and 'Farscape' will be
paired in a two-hour block on Friday nights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been an adventurous few years touring the entertainment universe
for the sci-fi series "Stargate SG-1." But the good news is that the
delightfully droll series that helped make space travel fun again
will live on for some time to come.</LD>
<LD>   Based on the 1994 theatrical release "Stargate," featuring Kurt
Russell and James Spader, the series about a space "portal" that
allows instant travel across the galaxy was launched on the Showtime
cable channel in June 1997 with Richard Dean Anderson ("MacGyver") at
the helm.</LD>
<LD>   The show drew good notices from critics and solid ratings from
viewers during its five-year run, the last four in syndication as
well. But with its contractual commitment with Showtime up, there
were new worlds to conquer, so tonight at 9, "Stargate SG-1" begins
its sixth season by debuting, appropriately enough, on the Sci Fi
Channel.</LD>
<TE>   The series will be paired in a solid two-hour block each Friday
with another hip space saga, "Farscape." And as an added treat for
those with the equipment to enjoy it, both effects-rich series will
be offered in wide-screen format.</TE>
<TE>   Sci Fi has ordered 22 new episodes of "Stargate SG-1" and has
renewed "Farscape" not just for its fourth season, which begins
tonight, but for a fifth as well. Programmers at the channel, a
subsidiary of USA Networks, apparently believe they have a little
programming juggernaut on their hands. And you know what? They just
might be right.</TE>
<TE>   "Stargate SG-1," the heavyweight of the Friday night tag-team
tandem, comes out of the chute smokin' with the first of a
two-parter, "Redemption." In the episode, the Stargate has gone
haywire, and if Col. Jack O'Neill (Anderson) and company can't get to
the problem within a tight time frame, Earth will shrivel up and die.
Now, that's a cliffhanger.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson and co-stars Amanda Tapping (Major Samantha Carter),
Christopher Judge (Teal'c) and newly added Corin Nemec (Jonas Quinn)
have a smooth rapport, and their sly quippery combined with all the
interplanetary carrying-on make for a rollicking good time. Even if
you haven't caught the series before, tonight's episode serves as a
pretty seamless spot to jump aboard.</TE>
<TE>   And as promised by the show's creators, the switch from Showtime
to the Sci Fi Channel has resulted in no apparent drop-off in
"Stargate's" slick production values.</TE>
<TE>   "Farscape" is a grungier, sexier take on the space frontier, with
Ben Browder starring as Commander John Crichton, a modern-day
American astronaut who accidentally gets blasted through a wormhole
to the other side of the universe. Darn that NASA.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's episode, "Crichton Kicks," puts the star in harm's way
aboard a creaking wreck of a ship that suddenly is targeted for
salvage by some interstellar tough guys--and their dog.</TE>
<TE>   Raelee Hill guest stars as a whose-side-are-you-on? alien who
wouldn't look out of place on Hollywood Boulevard in her platform
shoes, orange plastic mini-dress and Medusa hairdo.</TE>
<TE>   As in "Stargate SG-1," the humor in "Farscape" smooths things
along for those new to the series, and the imaginative sets and
freaky co-stars from the Jim Henson Creature Shop have Jar Jar-free
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Stargate SG-1" can be seen at 9 and 11 tonight on the Sci Fi
Channel. The network has rated it TV-PG (may be inappropriate for
young children). "Farscape" can be seen at 10 p.m. and midnight. The
network has rated it TV-14-V (may be inappropriate for children
younger than 14, with an advisory for violence). The original
"Stargate" movie will be shown at 6:30 p.m.</TE>

<HD>A Refreshing Sojourn Along the Shores of 'Swan Lake'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly a half-century ago, Vladimir Bourmeister's restaging of "Swan
Lake" for Moscow Stanislavsky Ballet represented high-risk
revisionism. However, on Wednesday, when the company added this 1953
production to its ongoing engagement (through Sunday) at the Kodak
Theatre in Hollywood, it seemed an artful compromise, integrating
Bourmeister's musical and dramatic innovations with 19th century
traditions and Soviet-era political mandates.</LD>
<LD>   Danced with disarming freshness and an unerring command of
classical style, it is easily the best "Swan Lake" seen on local
stages since the Royal Ballet brought its reconstruction of the
Petipa-Ivanov edition to the Music Center in 1995.</LD>
<LD>   For conservatives, there's 3 1/2 hours of Tchaikovsky lyricism,
conducted with great authority by Georgy Zhemchuzhin, plus painterly
sets and sumptuous costumes by Vladimir Arefiev, and even infusions
of the classic 1895 Lev Ivanov choreography for Act 2. As usual,
there's a nasty sorcerer, a stricken swan queen and an ineffectual
prince--along with several dozen young women in gleaming white tutus
moving gracefully through large-scale formal dances as if cloned for
this purpose.</LD>
<TE>   For collectors of unusual staging ploys, there's a brilliantly
conceived ballroom scene in which the seductive Odile keeps
materializing amid the national dances, plus Bourmeister's celebrated
prologue in which Rothbart turns Odette into a swan. (If that idea
sounds familiar, many productions have borrowed it, most recently the
one by American Ballet Theatre.)</TE>
<TE>   You'll also find a lot of the music in unexpected places, for
Bourmeister chose to follow the original score rather than the
cut-and-paste job in use by ballet companies for more than a century.</TE>
<TE>   You can also find a few anomalies: vestiges of conventional
gesture-language in a production otherwise mime-free, for example,
and, more seriously, a last act with genuine tragic sweep that
suddenly and none too convincingly switches to the happy ending
required of every Russian "Swan Lake" under communism.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, some balletomanes care only about the dancing, but it
does make a difference when Tatiana Chernobrovkina as Odile performs
28 fouettes (four of them doubles) in Act 3 to music that you're not
used to hearing in the Black Swan pas de deux. Or, conversely, when
Dmitry Zababurin as the Prince dances a solo in the first act to
music that you are used to hearing in the Black Swan pas de deux.</TE>
<TE>   Chernobrovkina has the majestic line, refined technique and
carefully schooled musicality for the role, but her phrasing seems
almost by rote rather than personalized, so you end up admiring her
performance as the Swan Queen but not falling under its spell. If she
only dug a little deeper....</TE>
<TE>   Zababurin partners her adroitly but stays mopey rather than
thoughtful, antiheroic even when walking on water in the last act's
climactic flood--and utterly ordinary as a soloist. Dmitry Erlikin
flaps enormous wings and hurls a scarlet cape with great assurance as
Rothbart, and Denis Perkovsky brings a welcome lightness to the
incessant bravura intrusions of the Jester.</TE>
<TE>   Among the subsidiary women, Anastasia Pershenkova dances with
great delicacy as the Prince's girlfriend and great zest in the
Neapolitan divertissement. Kadria Amirova leads the Spanish forces
commandingly and the Act 1 pas de quatre (replacing the usual pas de
trois) showcases Ekaterina Safonova, Natalia Schelokova, Roman
Malenko and Stanislav Boukharaev.</TE>
<TE>   All of them embody a style less extreme than the hyper-extended
norm for dancers from the Kirov or Perm companies. Just like their
production of "Swan Lake," they represent a bridge between past and
present, updating a classical legacy inherited from Imperial Russia
but in no hurry to adopt the radical changes in body placement
formulated early in the Soviet era.</TE>
<TE>   They are, in every way, a noble breed--contemporary artists
proudly associated with the house of Stanislavsky who can just as
proudly merge their individuality in the anonymity of a swan-corps to
renew a classic that many, many better known ensembles diminish into
mere showpiece fodder.</TE>

<HD>'Bad Company' Isn't Good for Rock</HD>
<DH>The high-flying, rapid-fire satirist is straitjacketed in a
lumbering spy extravaganza involving nuclear terrorists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GENE SEYMOUR</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Late in "Bad Company," maybe too late to make much of a difference,
Chris Rock is finally permitted to rear back, let fly and take
control of the screen. This long-awaited electricity comes just after
John Slattery, as a smug, cold-fish CIA official, patronizes Rock's
Jake Hayes, a street hustler from Jersey City pressed into spy duty
that's placed him in harm's way.</LD>
<LD>   Rock's character unloads steaming bricks of inspired vitriol
against Slattery and his cronies for this whole nerve-racking
situation, persuasively arguing at one point that if a woman had
heard that Saddam Hussein was sleeping with her husband, she'd find
the Iraqi leader faster than the CIA.</LD>
<LD>   This is the fire-breathing, up-to-the-minute iconoclasm that made
Rock the preeminent stand-up satirist of our time--made him, in fact,
hot enough to cast as a co-star in this high-profile Jerry
Bruckheimer production.</LD>
<TE>   Once Rock's tirade ends, Slattery sheepishly turns to his
nonplused troops and says, "OK, show's over." And it is--except that
there's still about 25 minutes of meandering bluster and bewildering
car chases through the caverns of Manhattan in pursuit of terrorists
ready to blow up the city with a portable nuclear bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Whether you care if they find them or not may depend on how much
you've been able to withstand "Bad Company's" sensory overload of
firefights, vehicular mayhem, techno-cool swagger and enough
bumptious contrivances to fill several seasons of daffy prime-time
soaps.</TE>
<TE>   This lumbering machine, directed with a lighter-than-usual touch
by Joel Schumacher, is set in motion when secret agent Kevin Pope
(Rock) is murdered by these terrorists while trying to buy the
itinerant nuke from a Russian mobster (Peter Stormare). Since no one
except his CIA bosses knows that Pope is dead, agency field chief
Gaylord Oakes (Anthony Hopkins) forges a hail-Mary plan to recruit
Pope's twin brother, Hayes (see, they were given up to different
parents for adoption), to take his place in negotiations for the
bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins squints, sneers and glides through his action-hero duties,
chewing toothpicks and gum along with pieces of scenery. His
character Oakes (isn't William F. Buckley Jr. entitled to some loose
change for lending his own spy hero's last name to this thing?) drags
Rock's Jake through a crash course in international spy craft without
really connecting with whatever innate intelligence Jake brings to
the table. Only we're allowed to notice how cerebral and commanding
Jake is at hustling chess games and Madison Square Garden tickets, to
see the raw material for heroism and dimension.</TE>
<TE>   Once he's in deep cover, however, Jake is placed at the mercy of
events. His--and Rock's--intelligence is subsumed by tired cliches.
He spends much of "Bad Company" being jittery, dysfunctional and
perpetually frightened in the manner of Mantan Moreland's Birmingham
Brown roles in dozens of 1940s Charlie Chan movies.</TE>
<TE>   Moreland, as with most of his black comic peers of his era, had
talents that far exceeded the roles he was offered. But they took
such demeaning roles because, back then, Hollywood didn't give them
any choice. Rock, given his clout in pop culture, does have a choice.
Many choices. Or so one presumes.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13 for intense sequences of violent action, some
sensuality and language. Times guidelines: Fairly brutal violence and
nasty talk for a PG-13 film.</TE>

<HD>East West's 'World' Takes a Familiar Spin</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the world goes 'round, does Tim Dang's East West Players
production of the musical revue "The World Goes 'Round" bring
anything especially distinctive to the New York-style sensibility of
the musical team of composer John Kander and lyricist Fred Ebb?</LD>
<LD>   Well, in the "New York, New York" finale, the cast members sing
the lyrics in various Asian languages and wave little flags from the
corresponding countries before uniting for the familiar English
lyrics, a slight variation on the original staging that emphasizes
the Asian side of the Big Apple's diversity.</LD>
<LD>   And in "The Grass Is Always Greener," a funny duet between a
glamorous star and her homemaker friend who envy each other's lives,
the homemaker is impressed by the star's friendship with Lea Salonga
of "Miss Saigon" and "Flower Drum Song" fame--a personalized joke,
for the star in this song is played by Jennifer Paz, who took over
Salonga's role in the L.A. productions of both of those shows.</LD>
<TE>   Elsewhere, however, this "The World Goes 'Round" isn't very
different from the other productions seen in Greater L.A. over the
last decade--which is to say, the quality of any given moment depends
on the quality of the source material</TE>
<TE>   Thirty songs from 13 shows make up the evening, and Ebb's lyrics
in particular range from brilliant to cliched.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly the bulk of the show is amply entertaining. Everyone
sings well, and the look of the five singers is sufficiently varied.
They execute Dang's staging without a hitch, with the help of
choreographer Reggie Lee and musical director Scott Nagatani.</TE>
<TE>   Paz brings an understated elegance to the opening title number,
and she and Kerry Carnahan are a hoot as the slightly sloshed women
who tsk-tsk about the lack of "Class" in society and as the "Grass is
Always Greener" duo. Carnahan changes moods dramatically in "How
Lucky Can You Get?" and leads off the second act with a spirited
"Ring Them Bells," but she appears stranded by the staging of "Isn't
This Better."</TE>
<TE>   Michael K. Lee displays a dapper sense of style in "Sara Lee" and
"Mr. Cellophane," and his interpretation of "Sometimes a Day Goes By"
blends beautifully with Paul Nakauchi's rendition of "I Don't
Remember You."</TE>
<TE>   Nakauchi is stuck with a few of the songs that work least well
outside their original context, such as "Kiss of the Spider Woman,"
but thanks to his little strip-tease in "Arthur in the Afternoon,"
he's a living rebuttal of the complaint sometimes voiced by Asian
American actors that they don't get to play hunks. Jennifer Say Gan
is the woman who relies on Arthur's charms, and she pulls off the
show's most haunting song, "A Quiet Thing."</TE>
<TE>   The ensemble is funny on crutches in "Pain" and uses
aerobics-style slide boards instead of skates in "The Rink," which
works well enough, considering the size of the stage.</TE>
<TE>   The cast looks eerie in "Money," thanks to Frank McKown's
lighting, and they glide through the jazzy five-part arrangement of
"Cabaret" with ease.</TE>
<TE>   Melissa Ficociello's set suggests a carousel without undue
extravagance, but use of a disco ball is distracting during one of
the songs.</TE>

<HD>'Ghetto Cabaret' Blurs the Line Between Survival,
Collaboration</HD>

<AU>Philip Brandes, F. Kathleen Foley,</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"We rip the basic necessities of human survival out from under you,"
marvels the sardonic Nazi occupation commander at the resilience of
his Lithuanian Jewish captives. "And what do you do? You build a
theater--you sing and dance!"</LD>
<LD>   Trivial entertainment becomes an allegorical vehicle for keeping
the human spirit alive amid the squalid horrors of the Holocaust in
Israeli playwright Joshua Sobol's "Ghetto Cabaret" (first presented
in English as "Ghetto" at the Mark Taper Forum in 1986). Newly
adapted by producer Jorge Albertella and director Letitzia Schwartz,
a stirring--though unevenly cast--L.A. Jewish Theatre staging
effectively tugs at the heartstrings and the social conscience. Based
on historical events, this story of a scrappy troupe of reluctant
actors mirrors the ever-narrowing options for an entire population,
complete with hard choices, internal strife and fundamental ethical
questions to which there are no right answers.</LD>
<LD>   In the unenviable center of the drama sits Gens (Eddie Padilla),
the appointed Jewish police chief who serves as cat's paw for the
sinister malice of the omnipotent Nazi, Kittel (Andy Brendle).</LD>
<TE>   Padilla's gaunt, haunted presence eloquently conveys the burden of
Gens' no-win position, as he tries to keep some of his people alive
at the cost of appeasement and collaboration with his persecutor. A
wealthy factory owner (Gary Bullock) adopts a strategy of even
further capitulation, supplying Nazi uniforms in an attempt to make
himself indispensable. What price survival, the play
ponders--especially in a world where one cannot afford a clear
conscience?</TE>
<TE>   Brendle's baleful malevolence is the centerpiece of the show,
illuminating Kittel's keen intellect and self-awareness of his own
utterly black heart--a chilling embodiment of culture corrupted
beyond redemption.</TE>
<TE>   Also noteworthy are Lisa Fishman as the beautiful singer with the
voice of an angel who plays a dangerous game of flirtation with
Kittel, and Moe Gans-Pomerantz as a jester who uses a sock puppet to
hurl barbs of defiance.</TE>
<TE>   The staging leavens the darkness with some nicely choreographed
musical interludes. However, the depictions of amateur performers by
some of the supporting cast prove realistic to the point of
distraction. Yet despite its reliance on familiar holocaust themes,
this piece still packs plenty of emotional wallop.</TE>

<TE>   'Monkeyhouse' Is Rife With Absurdist Turns</TE>
<TE>   "A Lonely Monkeyhouse," a Company of Angels production now playing
an extended run at the Two Roads Theatre, is a wacky absurdist comedy
that defies easy recapitulation.</TE>
<TE>   High concept this is not. Energetically skewing reality at every
turn, Martin Dockery's play is so weirdly offbeat, it plays like a
transcribed dream. The most normal and accessible character in this
eccentric mix happens to be a shaven female chimpanzee now passing
for human. Other characters include a troubled married couple--he has
fallen in love with the chimpanzee; she is an armed and dangerous
woman scorned--a World Health Organization bureaucrat who is
convinced he is God's exponent on Earth and a young man who has a
hand where his foot should be.</TE>
<TE>   Did we mention that the planet, spinning ever faster on its axis,
is about to be torn apart by centrifugal force? In fact, the crack is
beginning right in the center of the town square.</TE>
<TE>   Dockery's pre-apocalyptic shenanigans are lighthearted, loony and
purposely disorienting. The disgruntled wife's attempt to patch the
world together with Elmer's glue is the stuff of fine Carrollian
nonsense. Occasionally, however, Dockery's stream-of-consciousness
musings seem the stuff of a first draft--meandering, undisciplined
and noncohesive. Fortunately, director Jon Malmed's antic staging
lends heft to Dockery's featherweight endeavor, balancing the manic
energy that the play requires with solid comic timing. The
appropriately angst-ridden ensemble, which features Michael Merton,
Sarah Nina Phillips, Patrick Gorman, Carolyn Crotty, Noel Johansen,
Christian Arroyo and Gary J. Klavans, is straightforwardly zany,
spinning ever faster on the play's axis without tearing its delicate
microcosm apart.</TE>

<TE>   Diary of a Transformed Housewife in 'Friedan'</TE>
<TE>   Despite the possibilities opened up by the feminist movement, the
balancing act between domestic and career roles still poses tough
challenges for today's women. Back in 1958, the straitjacket of
social acceptability made the obstacles even more daunting.</TE>
<TE>   For full-time housewife and closet aspiring playwright Amy
Nichols, the unexpected interest in her work by a top Broadway
producer brings chaotic disruption to Eisenhower-era suburban
tranquillity in Ann Marcus' "Waiting for Betty Friedan" at Theatre
East in Studio City.</TE>
<TE>   As the co-creator of the hit 1970s anti-sitcom "Mary Hartman, Mary
Hartman," Marcus has already demonstrated she is no stranger to the
theme of housewives beset by wacky predicaments. With this new
warmhearted comedy, Marcus turns back the clock to a time when
pursuing creative talents was a frightening new frontier for her
heroine, effectively played by Elizabeth Mann in Stu Berg's staging.</TE>
<TE>   Amy is so embarrassed by her artistic ambitions that she keeps her
efforts a secret from her lawyer husband, Arthur (Michael Harrity),
who after predictable stubborn opposition reverses course in a
charmingly played reconciliation scene.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating Amy's dilemma are ill-timed visits from Amy's
bohemian New York friends (Suzanne Hunt and Derrel Maury) and a
shifty theatrical agent (Barry Jenner). Dan Gilvary brings offbeat
mischief reminiscent of Joe E. Brown to Arthur's boss, who shows up
for dinner at the worst possible time.</TE>
<TE>   Buoyed by agreeable performances, the quick-moving story sustains
interest. But this Cinderella story is too fuzzy around the edges to
cut very deeply. Amy's talent and intelligence are qualities we have
to take on faith, as no opportunities arise for her to display them,
and there is never a sense of anything fundamental at stake here.
With no new insights or perspectives reached, retro charm ultimately
slides into dated familiarity.</TE>

<TE>   Native Voices at the Autry Begins With 'Jump Kiss'</TE>
<TE>   "Jump Kiss: An Indian Legend," at the Autry Museum's Wells Fargo
Theatre, is a miniaturist snapshot of family life that blurs when
stretched to fit a larger theatrical framework.</TE>
<TE>   The play is the first script chosen for production by the Native
Voices at the Autry series. The program bios feature not only a list
of credits but the exact ethnic mix of the performers, most of whom
are of Native American descent. That's somewhat ironic because only
the trappings of this production--a man in Native American garb
performing authentic ceremonial music, archival photographs of Native
Americans, even footage of buffalo roaming the plains--have any
ethnic specificity.</TE>
<TE>   Although playwright Diane Glancy, the daughter of a Cherokee
father and a German-English mother, attempts to extrapolate some
larger meaning from her autobiographical account about growing up in
a mixed-race household in 1950s Kansas, the play remains a generic
portrait of any family and any place.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps that is intentional, a wry statement on the commonality of
human experience and the narrowness of the ethnic divide. Yet despite
a few memorable interludes and a certain elegiac lyricism, Glancy's
narrative is mushy, her characters underdeveloped. The play, which is
narrated by Glancy's adult self (Dolores Apollonia Chavez), is
subtitled "An Indian Legend," but legendary elements--apart from one
Cherokee fable thrown into the mix--are in short supply. Glancy's
treatment of her Cherokee father (Gil Birmingham), an avid hunter and
outdoorsman trapped in a benumbing job in a Kansas slaughterhouse, is
poignant, yet cursory.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Glancy's allusions to marital polarization, both in her
parents' relationship and in her own painfully failed marriage, we
are never privy to the precise source of all this dissension and
pain.</TE>
<TE>   Glancy's childhood self (Tonantzin Carmelo) may refer to her
fractious relationship with her mother (Ellen Dostal), but the strife
is only alluded to, never dramatized. And what, exactly, resulted in
Glancy's complete alienation from her husband after 20 years of
marriage remains unclear.</TE>
<TE>   The high points in Randy Reinholz's disciplined yet ponderous
staging are Birmingham and Dostal, whose sweet sexual chemistry may
not serve Glancy's themes of marital alienation, but who give scope
and substance to Glancy's dramatized journal.</TE>

<HD>House Arrest Holds 'Cherish' Back</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Cherish" is an unfortunate title for a film that has nothing
endearing about it. Implausible at every turn, it offers a dab of
quirkiness and edge from writer-director Finn Taylor, but otherwise
has nothing for audiences to embrace.</LD>
<LD>   Stars Robin Tunney and Tim Blake Nelson have enough going for them
that they would be worth seeing in happier circumstances, but they
can't make much of a dent in this negligible film.</LD>
<LD>   Tunney plays Zoe, a San Francisco computer animator lacking in
self-confidence even though she's attractive and has a good enough
job to purchase a small condo. She is continually snubbed by the
office ice princess (Liz Phair) and spends her evenings listening to
a radio station specializing in vintage sentimental love songs.</LD>
<TE>   On a rare evening out, she works up enough gumption to crash an
office party, and winds up drinking and dancing with a sexy co-worker
(Jason Priestley), who is concerned that she's had too much to drink
to drive home. Overruling him, she gets in her car, only to find a
shadowy figure lunging at her and forcing her to step on the gas. A
cop in an intersection winds up dead, and her assailant has vanished.</TE>
<TE>   Facing serious prison time should she be convicted of manslaughter
while driving under the influence, Zoe is put under house arrest
while awaiting trial. She turns over her assets, including her new
condo, to a no-nonsense attorney (Nora Dunn), who gets her client
confined to her new digs, a seedy loft in a dicey area, where she
must wear an electronic surveillance anklet.</TE>
<TE>   We are therefore treated to long stretches of Zoe doing not much
of anything in her new surroundings, although she does try to move
beyond the 50-foot radius set by the monitoring device.</TE>
<TE>   From time to time, a serious, straight-arrow young county deputy,
Daly (Nelson), checks on her. Downstairs neighbor Max (Ricardo Gil)
is sympathetic to Zoe and her plight, but is limited by his
wheelchair. Denied a computer and stupidly smashing her TV in a
moment of frustration, Zoe has her phone and her music to keep her
company, but she has no interest in reading. Neither her attorney nor
Daly believes her when she tries to explain that her elusive
assailant was really responsible for the policeman's death.</TE>
<TE>   The square and reticent Daly and Zoe are clearly drawn to each
other, and "Cherish" might have made it had Daly cast his lot with
Zoe much earlier and helped in a pursuit of the mysterious true
killer. As it is, "Cherish" makes us feel that we're being held
prisoner as much as Zoe.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language. Times guidelines: Fairly tame.</TE>

<LD>"You think you're all that." "Whaddup?" "What's the sitch?" It's "no
big"....Welcome to crime-fighting, high school cheerleader-style.</LD>
<LD>   The Disney Channel's lavish new cartoon series, "Kim Possible,"
about a teen who can whup international villains and still be home in
time for dinner, dates itself by the minute with peppy pop slang and
the title character's midriff-baring shirts.</LD>
<LD>   She frets about her popularity and dithers over asking her crush
to a dance, too, when not battling warped scientists and
megalomaniacs with super-weapons and gravity-defying martial arts
moves.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the show, from creators Mark McCorkle and Bob Schooley, and
director Chris Bailey, can be a kick. Its cel animation, with layered
designs, geometric shapes and textures, is stylish and creative. The
humor is often wicked fun.</TE>
<TE>   In one of today's three back-to-back introductory episodes
(beginning at 6:30 p.m.), for instance, Ricardo Montalban voices a
multibillionaire who knocks out power across Europe by fueling the
world's largest tanning lamp. Kim's sidekick, Ron Stoppable,
inadvertently inspires the bored mogul to pursue global domination
and earns this post-apocalyptic advice: "Never, never tell anyone to
go out and buy Spinning Tops of Doom."</TE>
<TE>   The solid voice cast is led by Christy Carlson Romano as Kim, with
Will Friedle as Ron, Tahj Mowry as Webmaster Wade, Jean Smart and
Gary Cole as Kim's brain surgeon mother and rocket scientist father,
and "Futurama's" John DiMaggio and "Mad TV's" Nicole Sullivan as
arch-villain Dr. Drakken.</TE>

<HD>Forever Ya-Yas</HD>
<DH>In a heartfelt film adaptation, four friends cherish their
lifelong sisterhood</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like the lives of its characters, not to mention its title, nothing
about "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood" is neat, orderly,
concise.</LD>
<LD>   This is a work of excess and passion, an untidy sprawl of a motion
picture that is sometimes ragged, occasionally uncertain, but--and
this is what's important--always warm, accessible and rich in
emotional life. That's because veteran screenwriter ("Thelma &amp;
Louise") and first-time director Callie Khouri has a strong feeling
for the lifelong friendship of four powerful Southern women, the
unshakable fellowship without rings that "Secrets" details. This film
is strong when and where it needs to be, in its ability to convey
heartfelt sentiments and portray the power of a very particular kind
of sisterhood.</LD>
<LD>   At the heart of "Secrets," shoring up its emotional truth, is the
performance of Ashley Judd as Vivi, the most dramatic and the most
troubled of the Ya-Yas. After seeing Judd mark time in the recent
"High Crimes," it's especially satisfying to see this charismatic
performer really connect with a role and make it come fully alive.</LD>
<TE>   Written by Khouri, adapted by Mark Andrus ("As Good as It Gets")
and based on the novel of the same name by Rebecca Wells as well as
its companion book, "Little Altars Everywhere," "Secrets" uses three
sets of actresses to follow its four protagonists from their
childhood in 1930s Louisiana through their coming of age during World
War II through their modern incarnation as crusty battle-axes who say
things like "I hope this isn't a real emergency; I only brought one
vodka bottle."</TE>
<TE>   Although Judd is the undisputed star of the coming-of-age section,
the four women who play the Ya-Yas in their battle-ax years--Ellen
Burstyn, Maggie Smith, Shirley Knight and Fionnula
Flanagan--beautifully share the ensemble glory. To see actresses like
this given their heads to play forceful, well-defined, mature women
is to see something not on view often enough.</TE>
<TE>   After an opening prologue showing the four Ya-Yas as little girls
sneaking out at night to take a solemn oath of friendship as members
of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood ("This is done for all eternity, loyal
forever"), "Secrets" moves to modern Manhattan, where Vivi's
daughter, rising young playwright Sidda Lee Walker (a businesslike
Sandra Bullock) is giving the obligatory interview to Time magazine
about her roots.</TE>
<TE>   What results are quotes about her mother's drinking, her fighting,
her all-around difficulty. "I owe my creativity to her," Sidda
concludes. "If I'd had an easy childhood, I'd have nothing to write
about."</TE>
<TE>   Back home in Louisiana, the adult Vivi (Burstyn) is not amused.
Mother and daughter exchange vituperative dispatches and finally
break off all communication, in the process threatening Sidda's
long-delayed marriage to the long-suffering Connor (Angus MacFadyen).
Clearly, this is a job for the Ya-Yas.</TE>
<TE>   Taking it upon themselves to mend the rift and concluding that "an
extreme situation implies extreme measures," the Ya-Yas fly to New
York, drug and kidnap Sidda (a major change from the very popular
novel) and take her back to an isolated cabin in Louisiana where they
can show her the Ya-Yas' precious scrapbook and talk some sense into
her.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that the Ya-Yas don't understand what a major drama queen
Vivi has always been, it's not that they haven't witnessed her taking
up all the space in the room. It's that they want Sidda to understand
how her mother got that way, to see, via flashbacks featuring Judd,
the hand life dealt her. "You are a lot more normal than you have any
right to be," they tell Sidda, adding the caveat, "She is what she
is, but you have a long life ahead of you."</TE>
<TE>   Not only hasn't everything gone smoothly in Vivi's life,
everything doesn't go smoothly in the retelling of it. Some of
"Secrets" is too pat, too Hollywood, some of it feels unfocused, but
the film's biggest problem is with its men.</TE>
<TE>   Both the long-suffering Connor and Vivi's husband, the
even-more-long-suffering Shep Walker (James Garner), are duller than
dishwater, ineffectual characters who can't hope to hold our
interest. Which means the considerable amount of time "Secrets"
devotes to whether Connor and Sidda are going to stay together plays
like a waste of time.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "Secrets" is not without resources to recapture our
attention. It's got an exciting and wide-ranging soundtrack, produced
by T Bone Burnett and David Mansfield, and featuring blues star Jimmy
Reed, Cajun legend Ann Savoy, Alison Krauss, Lauryn Hill and others.
And it's got a love for language, for irreplaceable lines like "I
take a problem and chew on it till all the flavor is gone and then I
stick it in my hair."</TE>
<TE>   But what "Secrets" has most of all, what Khouri has created that
overcomes its flaws, is a sense of women confident in their power,
their friendship, their emotionality, women excited to just be able
to be themselves. That too is something we don't see often enough.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for mature thematic elements, language and
brief sensuality. Times guidelines: Nothing that is likely to trouble
older teens.</TE>

<LD>Ford Motor Co.'s Focus car is under investigation by U.S. regulators
for engine stalls and loss of power, the second problem in three
months for the No. 2 auto maker's compact car. The investigation may
result in the recall of 574,700 vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   The National Highway Traf- fic Safety Administration's monthly
report also said it is looking at complaints that steering can lock
up without warning on 1997 and 1998 model General Motors Corp. cars
and minivans, possibly causing drivers to lose control. That
investigation involves 457,000 vehicles and reports of eight
injuries.</LD>

<HD>Ford Shakes Up Luxury Division</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. named a senior Volvo official as executive director
for North America of its Premier Automotive Group in the latest
management shake-up at Ford's key luxury car division.</LD>
<LD>   Dan Werbin, chief of Volvo Cars of North America, will switch jobs
with Victor Doolan, who has served as regional director of
Irvine-based Premier Automotive since Ford created the division in
1999.</LD>
<LD>   Premier Automotive includes Ford's Jaguar, Land Rover, Aston
Martin and Volvo luxury brands.</LD>
<TE>   Former Mazda Motor Co. President Mark Fields took over as chief of
Premier Automotive this month, and a Ford source said it was safe to
assume that he ordered the job swap that promoted Werbin and demoted
Doolan.</TE>
<TE>   Ford is counting on Premier Automotive to help it return to
profitability and expects it to generate one-third of its earnings by
mid-decade. The company does not break out the unit's financial
results but said for the first time last month that the division is
now profitable.</TE>

<LD>Circuit City Raises Profit Outlook</LD>
<LD>   Consumer electronics retailer Circuit City Group said it expects
to report a fiscal first-quarter profit of 5 cents to 8 cents a share
as shoppers bought more big-screen televisions and DVD players.</LD>
<LD>   The company had expected to earn 3 cents.</LD>
<TE>   Higher sales helped Circuit City narrow a loss from its Circuit
City unit to 1 cent to 4 cents. The company had expected a
"mid-to-high-single-digit loss." Circuit City's CarMax business
contributed 9 cents a share to the company's profit.</TE>
<TE>   Rival Best Buy Co. said per-share profit for the fiscal quarter
ended Saturday is expected at the high end of its forecast of 20
cents to 21 cents. Analysts had expected 21 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Richmond, Va.-based Circuit City fell 24 cents to $22.60
on the NYSE. Shares of Eden Prairie, Minn.-based Best Buy rose $1.46
to $45.52, also on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>CBS, ABC, Fox and NBC said they booked a combined $7.4 billion in
advance advertising sales for the next TV season, 19% higher than a
year ago and more than expected.</LD>
<LD>   The sales topped the previous record of $7.1 billion in 2000, when
the so-called upfront ad market was buoyed by demand from Internet
companies, many of which have gone out of business, said Arthur
Schreibman, a director of national media buying at Initiative Media,
one of the biggest buyers of advertising for clients. Last year's
upfront sales totaled about $6.2 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of NBC parent General Electric Co. fell 85 cents to $29.30.
Class B shares of Viacom Inc., owner of CBS, fell 32 cents to $48.93.
Walt Disney Co., owner of ABC, fell 42 cents to $21.70. Fox
Entertainment Group Inc., the U.S. media arm of Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp., shares fell 27 cents to $25.23, all on the New York Stock
Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   The networks said they booked higher sales in all advertising
categories, particularly among movie studios and auto makers.</TE>

<LD>Production of movies, TV shows, commercials and music videos shot on
the streets of Los Angeles dropped 10% in May from a year earlier,
when studios were scurrying to wrap scores of projects in
anticipation of possible strikes by writers and actors.</LD>
<LD>   The number of production days in May totaled 2,236, according to
the Entertainment Industry Development Corp., which issues permits
for projects shot away from studio lots.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest drop came in work on feature films; those production
days fell 36% to 824. Shooting of TV shows continued to climb in May,
by 37% to 887. One production day equals a day of shooting on a
specific project. The longtime slide in commercial production appears
to have bottomed out, with production days rising for the second
straight month, by 7% to 386. The numbers do not account for shooting
on studio lots. Through May, production days are off by nearly 20%
this year.</LD>

<HD>Andersen Jurors End the Day Without a Verdict</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Jurors in the Arthur Andersen criminal trial asked for case exhibits
and sticky-tab memo notes Thursday before ending their first full day
of deliberations without reaching a verdict.</LD>
<LD>   The panel of nine men and three women, which heard 21 days of
testimony in the obstruction-of-justice case, sent U.S. District
Judge Melinda Harmon a series of notes, beginning with the request
for memo notes and highlighter pens. The jurors also asked for two
exhibits--a chronology of events drafted by Andersen and a binder of
key documents used by prosecutors in their closing arguments.</LD>
<LD>   The panel later asked for the testimony of former Andersen partner
David B. Duncan, the lead auditor on the firm's Enron Corp. account
who pleaded guilty to obstruction.</LD>
<TE>   Both prosecution and defense lawyers agreed the timeline display
and binder could not be allowed into the jury room under court rules.
But Harmon--over Andersen's objection--decided to give the jury an
index of the prosecution exhibits.</TE>
<TE>   Harmon rejected the request for Duncan's testimony, telling jurors
that they could ask only specific questions or request portions.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, who is cooperating with the government, testified that he
directed his team to comply with Andersen's document-retention
policy, which required the disposal of papers unnecessary for the
final audit files.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen contends that Duncan lacked the "corrupt" intent required
for a conviction, pointing out that he could not name any specific
items he intended to keep from the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Andersen issued reminders about the document
policy as a signal for executives to shred Enron-related documents.</TE>
<TE>   A conviction carries a penalty of a $500,000 fine and probably
would prompt the SEC to bar Andersen from auditing public companies.
An acquittal would undermine the Justice Department's Enron probe.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has been bleeding clients for months, however. Andersen's
global audit practice managing partner, C.E. Andrews, conceded late
Wednesday that even with an acquittal the firm "can never regain what
we were."</TE>
<TE>   The jury must reach a unanimous decision to render a verdict.</TE>

<HD>Weakness Reported in May Retail Sales</HD>
<DH>Economy: Cold, rainy weather dampened demand for summer
apparel, analysts say. Discounters, warehouse clubs fare best.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Cold, rainy weather in May dampened U.S. retail sales, especially of
summer apparel, and analysts said a cloudy economic picture will keep
demand down even as temperatures rise.</LD>
<LD>   "There's no question that consumer momentum is slowing," said
retail analyst Kevin Tawes of Independence Investments, a unit of
John Hancock Financial Services. "Consumers have lost the tailwind
that had pushed them forward, and we can't ask or expect more of them
in the months ahead."</LD>
<LD>   Analysts had expected May sales at stores open at least a year, a
key measure of retail performance, to be weak across the board,
especially for apparel retailers. Department stores such as J.C.
Penney Co. performed even worse than anticipated.</LD>
<TE>   "Consumers just aren't looking for summer clothes, an air
conditioner or a patio set when it's 60 degrees and raining," Tawes
said.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, discounters such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and warehouse
clubs such as Costco Wholesale Corp. fared best as consumers sought
low prices on staples such as food and household cleansers.</TE>
<TE>   Target Corp. posted disappointing results because it sells more
apparel than other discounters and thus is more vulnerable to the
weather. Its same-store sales rose 2.6%, falling short of a forecast
in the mid-single digits.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, posted a
6.2% increase as strong sales of groceries and household products
offset sluggish demand for seasonal merchandise. Some analysts had
expected only a 4% rise.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi said its index of 72 retailers showed a
3.5% rise in same-store sales in May, in line with its expectations
at the beginning of the month.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're still early enough in the summer season to pick up
in demand" for seasonal merchandise, said Mike Niemira, an economist
at the bank.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, many retailers said they were poised for pent-up demand
once the weather improves. But weather is only one piece of a
complicated puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   Gap Inc., the apparel giant that operates the Gap, Banana Republic
and Old Navy chains, marked its 26th straight month of same-store
sales declines as it struggles to win back customers who were turned
off by overly trendy products.</TE>
<TE>   Same-store sales fell 9% companywide and 15% in the domestic Gap
stores division.</TE>
<TE>   Women's apparel retailers AnnTaylor Stores Corp. and Talbots Inc.
both reported sales declines, but affirmed quarterly earnings
estimates as they refrained from discounting, which cuts into
profits.</TE>
<TE>   "The silver lining in this cloudy May is the fact that apparel
retailers entered the month with very lean inventories and were able
to protect margins in a weak sales environment," said UBS Warburg
analyst Richard Jaffe.</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 11 attacks, retailers fared so poorly and faced
such uncertainly that they planned conservatively for the spring.</TE>
<TE>   "Retailers that planned lean and operated more defensively,
minimizing downside rather than maximizing upside, did pretty well,"
Jaffe said. "In the second half, I think you'll see less defensive
inventory levels."</TE>
<TE>   By keeping less merchandise on hand, retailers avoid having to cut
prices in the event that it doesn't sell. But analysts said low
inventories also indicate a lack of confidence that demand will
increase significantly.</TE>
<TE>   Department stores were still under pressure last month as
consumers shunned higher-end, full-priced merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   Posting worse-than-expected declines were Federated Department
Stores Inc., which runs Macy's and Bloomingdale's, and May Department
Stores Co., as well as value-priced department chains J.C. Penney and
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.</TE>

<HD>CBS Refuses to Air Commercial for Schwab</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CBS won't show a TV ad by brokerage firm Charles Schwab Corp. that
draws a sleazy picture of Wall Street stock brokerages at a time the
industry is fending off charges of abusive sales practices.</LD>
<LD>   The commercial, which other TV networks are airing, features an
executive urging brokers at an unidentified firm to tell customers
that a stock is "red hot" even though the fundamentals "stink."</LD>
<LD>   After promising to reward whoever sells the most stock, the
executive encourages the brokers to "put some lipstick on this pig."</LD>
<TE>   The language echoes descriptions used by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
analysts in e-mail discussions of stocks touted as good investments
to the firm's customers. After the e-mails were obtained by New York
state Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer, Merrill Lynch last month paid $100
million to settle allegations it recommended troubled stocks to win
lucrative investment-banking fees.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco-based Schwab (ticker symbol: SCH) said the
commercial--part of an ad campaign launched May 16--wasn't spurred by
the early April revelation of the Merrill Lynch e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not inspired by any particular firm," Schwab spokesman
Glen Mathison said. "It was inspired by the generally reported and
documented practices of Wall Street brokerages."</TE>
<TE>   The sales practices of other prominent investment banks also are
under scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   CBS, owned by Viacom Inc., rejected the commercial because it
"impugns the motives of anyone who works for a big brokerage," Silver
said. "Our obligation is not to allow ads that unfairly disparage the
competition."</TE>
<TE>   CBS is airing three other Schwab ads in a campaign touting the
discount brokerage as a way to buy stocks without commission-driven
salesman.</TE>
<TE>   With the stock market's prolonged funk discouraging its customers
from buying stocks, Schwab is trying to develop products and services
to encourage more trading--a goal that eventually may force the firm
to grapple with its own conflict-of-interest questions, said industry
analyst Mark Constant of Lehman Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Schwab's attack on its Wall Street rivals is a sound
strategy in light of the scandalous headlines dominating the business
pages, Constant said.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes sense to kick a dog when it's down."</TE>
<TE>   Salomon Considering</TE>
<TE>   Simpler Rating System</TE>
<TE>   Salomon Smith Barney Inc. may simplify its stock rating system to
the equivalent of "buy," "sell" and "hold," responding to criticism
that Wall Street research is too bullish.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Michael Carpenter and research chief John Hoffmann
told the brokerage firm's analysts at a May 28 meeting that Salomon
might adopt the system, according to three people who attended. When
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co. put in place a similar plan in
March, its analysts immediately gave 22% of the firms their lowest
rating, up from 1%.</TE>
<TE>   Securities firms are overhauling their research practices in light
of Spitzer's probe and similar inquiries by the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "A driving force of all these changes is to satisfy the
regulators, to show the firms are doing a better job," said Alan
Bromberg, a law professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon telecom analyst Jack Grubman has been criticized for his
close relationship with Global Crossing Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News</TE>
<TE>   ICAP Is in Talks</TE>
<TE>   to Buy BrokerTec</TE>
<TE>   ICAP, the world's largest inter-bank money and securities broker,
is in talks to buy BrokerTec Global, the second-biggest online
Treasury securities broker, people familiar with the situation said.</TE>
<TE>   A sale to ICAP may help resolve a Justice Department probe into
whether the 14 banks that own BrokerTec violated antitrust rules by
shutting out competitors, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition would give London-based ICAP a bigger share of
trading in the $3-trillion Treasury market and ease concern about the
investigation. It doesn't preclude the government from prosecuting
the electronic bond broker should it determine that it fixed prices,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on how a sale
might affect the probe into the effects on competition of joint
ventures in the online-bond and foreign-exchange markets.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at ICAP and BrokerTec declined to comment.</TE>

<HD>Housing Affordability Plummets in California</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daryl Strickland</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Housing affordability plunged in California to its lowest level in 11
years as fast-rising prices shut out from the market a growing number
of potential homeowners, according to a report released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The index, measuring the percentage of households that can afford
a median-priced home, fell 7 percentage points to 27% from a year
earlier, said a monthly report released by the California Assn. of
Realtors.</LD>
<LD>   The median home price, meaning half cost less and half cost more,
rose in April by nearly 30% to $321,950 from a year earlier.</LD>
<TE>   President Robert Bailey called the report unsurprising.</TE>
<TE>   Even though mortgage rates have been edging down, Bailey said
steep increases in home prices statewide have dropped the index to
its lowest point since October 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Although mortgage rates have attracted many buyers to the market,
there is a record-low number of existing homes for sale statewide.</TE>
<TE>   At the current pace of sales, the supply would be depleted in only
two months, the group's latest figures show.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, the affordability index dropped to 31% from
38% a year ago. In Orange County, it decreased to 23% from 28%, and
in Ventura County, it fell to 32% from 37%.</TE>
<TE>   Contra Costa County recorded the lowest rate statewide at 11%,
down from a revised 13% a year ago.</TE>

<HD>Intel Cuts Forecast on Lower Demand</HD>
<DH>Tech: Reduced revenue estimate sends shares falling.
National Semiconductor, Texas Instruments fare better.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Intel Corp., the world's largest chip maker, scaled back its
second-quarter revenue forecast Thursday because of
lower-than-expected demand for personal computer processors in
Europe, sparking a steep slide in its stock in after-hours trading.</LD>
<LD>   The bad news from Intel probably will spur more losses today,
after a rough Thursday on Wall Street, where U.S. stocks hit
eight-month lows, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   "I think everyone is going to get whacked [today]," said Dan
Scovel, an analyst with Needham &amp; Co.</LD>
<TE>   Intel, known for its Pentium microprocessors that are the brains
of most personal computers, said it expects sales for the period
ending June 29 to be $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion, down from the
previous estimate of $6.4 billion to $7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were expecting second-quarter sales of $6.7 billion and
net earnings of 15 cents a share, according to Thomson
Financial/First Call. Last year, the company recorded sales of $6.3
billion and profit of 12 cents for the period.</TE>
<TE>   Early second-quarter sales may have been reduced by customers
waiting for Intel's May 26 price cuts, which averaged about 31% for
desktop processors and 46% for notebook chips, said Jonathan Joseph,
a Salomon Smith Barney analyst.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it shows greater expectations of weakness in the PC
market," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Although investors and analysts had prepared themselves for a
narrowing of the revenue range toward the lower end, that Intel took
the bottom out of the previous range was a surprise, indicating that
demand is even weaker than earlier thought.</TE>
<TE>   Intel also lowered its expectations of gross margin to about 49%,
from its previous forecast of 53%, plus or minus a couple of points,
because of lower-than-expected revenue and product mix. Gross margin
is the proportion of revenue remaining after subtracting product
costs.</TE>
<TE>   Intel's announcement sent its shares down $2.71 to $24.29 in
after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   The shares had closed off $1.18 to $27 on Nasdaq after trading
lower all day, dragged down by a downgrade from Merrill Lynch analyst
Joe Osha.</TE>
<TE>   Osha, seen as an Intel stalwart, cut his rating on the company to
a "neutral" from a "strong buy," citing "a lack of visibility into
the personal computer end market, particularly on the corporate
side."</TE>
<TE>   The ratings cut came ahead of Intel's scheduled mid-quarter
conference call and surprised some investors.</TE>
<TE>   Osha said investors were more concerned about Intel's lowered
forecast for gross margins than revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Two smaller chip makers had better news, however.</TE>
<TE>   National Semiconductor Corp. reported a surprise profit Thursday
in its fiscal fourth quarter, citing strong demand for chips used in
cellular phones and flat-panel monitors. For the three months ended
May 26, National Semiconductor earned $17.1 million, or 9 cents a
share--contrasted with a loss of $44.4 million, or 26 cents a share,
in the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Instruments Inc., the biggest maker of processor chips for
cell phones, reaffirmed its second-quarter forecast of about $2
billion in sales and profit of 5 cents a share.</TE>

<HD>Online Movie Site Closed Down</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dutch authorities Thursday took down Film88.com, a renegade online
movie site, by persuading an Internet provider in Holland to pull the
plug on the company's digital film library.</LD>
<LD>   Film88.com offered viewers an online movie theater showing hit
films on demand for $1, but it did so without paying or obtaining
permission from the studios. Although the company said it operated
out of Iran, which doesn't recognize foreign copyrights, its
computerized film library was housed in Holland, said Tim Kuik,
managing director of BREIN, a Dutch anti-piracy foundation.</LD>
<LD>   The founders of Film88.com had tried a similar venture,
Movie88.com, using computers located in Taiwan. But authorities in
that country shut down the service and seized its computers in
February in response to complaints from the studios.</LD>
<TE>   The latest venture had an even shorter run. The site's operators
announced their arrival on Tuesday, and within two days Film88.com
was offline.</TE>
<TE>   The action demonstrates how quickly Hollywood can respond to
piracy in countries that support international copyright treaties.
Although the enforcement mechanisms vary from country to country,
many nations require Internet providers to cut off infringing
customers or risk being held liable themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Kuik said his group acted in response to a request by the Motion
Picture Assn., the international trade group representing the major
Hollywood studios. Although the Film88 Web address is based in Iran,
it apparently used a Dutch Internet provider, TrueServer, to store
its movies and provide the large amount of bandwidth needed to
display movies in near-VHS quality.</TE>
<TE>   "The MPA understands that Internet piracy is a global phenomenon,"
said Mark Litvack, the association's director of legal affairs and
worldwide anti-piracy efforts. "Both in terms of our investigative
and our legal facilities, we are prepared ... to deal with it on a
global scope."</TE>
<TE>   The investigations into Film88.com and Movie88.com are continuing.
On its Web site, Film88.com said only that it was facing a "technical
proxy/caching problem" and promised to be back online as soon as
possible.</TE>
<TE>   If it does come back, Litvack said, the MPA will act again.</TE>

<HD>Supply of Homes for Sale Hits Record Low in State</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Shortage is acute in most of the Southland,
and the trend is expected to continue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the prime home-buying season gets underway, the number of existing
houses for sale across the state and most of Southern California
stands at a record low, causing prices to soar and buyers' hopes to
wilt.</LD>
<LD>   Inventory is expected to remain tight through the summer, and many
analysts believe the supply level will sink to unprecedented depths
for the fifth year in a row.</LD>
<LD>   "There just aren't enough homes on the market for sale," said
James Pugash, chairman of Hearthstone, a San Francisco-based provider
of capital for home builders. "If there was more inventory available,
there would be many more home sales, I have no doubt about that."</LD>
<TE>   Listings have declined for several reasons, analysts said. Some
homeowners fear their jobs aren't secure and are reluctant to risk
trading up. At the same time, economic prospects have been brighter
in Southern California than in the country overall, reducing the
housing turnover that comes with career transfers out of the region.</TE>
<TE>   Some homeowners are delaying putting their properties on the
market because they believe prices probably will rise still higher
and give them an opportunity to sell on more favorable terms. Others
are refinancing their home loans at today's low rates and using part
of the equity to make improvements, allowing them to stay put.</TE>
<TE>   Listings in San Diego County have plunged 59% from a year ago. In
Orange County the drop was nearly 30%, and in Los Angeles County it
was almost 27%, according to the latest first-quarter figures by the
California Assn. of Realtors. The region's most populous counties
suffered bigger drops than the state overall, where inventory fell
22%.</TE>
<TE>   There are fewer homes for sale in every price range below $1
million, and the shortage is especially acute in homes priced under
$300,000, the state figures show.</TE>
<TE>   Lack of supply is "a phenomenon across all regions of the
country," said David Lereah, chief economist for the National Assn.
of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   Inventory is edging up nationally but still hovers near record-low
levels. At the current selling pace, existing homes would be depleted
in 4.8 months. Agents say a supply of about six months is needed to
balance the market.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the problem is far more acute. At the rate of sales
in April, every home would be snapped up in two months if no more
went on sale. The historical average is seven months.</TE>
<TE>   Regionwide, the supply ranged in April from 1.3 months in Orange
County to 2.4 months in San Diego. A nine- to 10-month backlog
generally is needed to produce a stable market in California,
Realtors said.</TE>
<TE>   Mortgage interest rates have been under 7% for most of the year,
attracting a flood of entry-level buyers when few low-cost
condominiums and townhouses are available.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1980s, the last period when housing was scarce, a
building boom soon put a wide range of properties on the market. But
with such significant hurdles as high land costs and zoning
restrictions now blocking new construction, analysts widely believe
that there will be no ramp-up of production this time.</TE>
<TE>   The short supply is making it difficult for owners to sell their
homes and trade up, exacerbating the shortage and driving up prices
at all levels. "We're starting to see gaps in the marketplace because
the stepping stones are too wide apart," said Robert Bailey,
president of the state Realtors' group.</TE>
<TE>   Most analysts believe the home listings in Southern California
will edge up during the peak summer season, but the added supply
probably will not prevent robust gains in prices or markedly increase
desirable options for buyers.</TE>
<TE>   One analyst was more optimistic. John Karevoll of DataQuick
Information Systems Inc. predicted supply levels will significantly
increase this year as prices move up, enticing more owners to sell.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, home sales continue to rise, eating further into the
supply every month.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never seen the inventory as low as it was at the beginning
of the year, and it's still hovering about as low as I've ever seen
it," said Bob Waldron, a longtime agent at Coldwell Banker in
Westchester.</TE>
<TE>   Out of 48 single-family homes listed recently in Westchester, an
entry-level community for the Westside, only three were priced under
$450,000 Wednesday. A year ago, he said, buyers had a number of
options in the $350,000 range.</TE>
<TE>   Agents in Orange County also have struggled with scarce listings.
"You're seeing properties commanding higher prices that ordinarily
would not get top dollar," said Patrick Knapp of Remax Real Estate
Services in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   A two-bedroom townhouse built in the mid-1980s had stained and
ripped carpets and peeled paint and faced a busy street. Within two
days of hitting the market, the owners had four offers. The top
bidder, at $269,000, offered $4,000 above the asking price.</TE>
<TE>   The buyer was willing to make such a deal, Knapp said, because
there were so few options in Irvine. Only eight townhomes of
comparable size were listed this week between $250,000 and $300,000.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't just go down the street and buy a different property,"
Knapp said, "because nothing else is on the market."</TE>

<HD>Rising Concerns Push S&amp;P 500 to 8-Month Low</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Accounting concerns, fears of war send shares
lower. Weak business report could weigh on stocks today.</DH>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fears of war and a worsening confidence crisis in corporate America
drove the stock market broadly lower Thursday, while a weak business
forecast issued after the closing bell by a key tech stock boded ill
for today's trading.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone's just totally worried about accounting issues,
potential wars," said Todd Clark, head of listed trading at Wells
Fargo Securities in San Francisco. "The whole mind-set of the market
is so incredibly negative."</LD>
<LD>   After the market closed, technology bellwether Intel cut its
revenue forecast on slack demand from Europe. Shares of the computer
chip maker, down 4% in the regular session, plummeted an additional
10% in after-hours trading.</LD>
<TE>   "It's going to look nasty on the opening [today]," said Barry
Hyman, chief investment strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. News
that President Bush would address the nation Thursday evening on
security issues rattled investors by fanning concerns about future
attacks on the United States and flare-ups in the Middle East and the
Asian subcontinent.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average finished down 172.16 points, or
1.8%, at 9,624.64. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was beaten down
20.75 points, or 2.0% to 1,029.15, its lowest close since Sept. 27.
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index was down 40.38 points, or
2.5%, at 1,554.88.</TE>
<TE>   Losers led winners by more than 2 to 1 on Nasdaq and the New York
Stock Exchange in the heaviest trading in more than a month.</TE>
<TE>   The latest economic data gave early strength to stocks, but that
faded. The number of U.S. jobless benefits claims fell sharply last
week, below the key 400,000 mark for the first time in 2 1/2 months,
the Labor Department said.</TE>
<TE>   Intel fell $1.18 to $27 during regular trading after Merrill Lynch
analyst Joseph Osha cut midterm ratings on seven semiconductor
stocks--including Intel and Texas Instruments. He said low inventory
levels that have been fueling an upturn may be nearing the end.
Intel's stock traded at $24.29 after hours. Texas Instruments fell 75
cents to $27.69 in regular trading, and slipped to $26.05
after-hours.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of wireless telephone companies plunged after AirGate PCS
cut its subscriber growth forecast for the current quarter, scaring
off investors already jittery about slowing growth in the industry.
AirGate shares fell 67%--$5.65 a share--to $2.75. AirGate sells
wireless service under the Sprint PCS Group brand name. Among other
Sprint PCS affiliates, Alamosa Holdings shares fell $1.16 to an
all-time low of $2.49. Sprint PCS fell $1.79 to $7.99.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading, the dollar fell to a 16-month low against the
euro, and Treasury yields fell as investors fled the stock market for
government securities. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury
note fell to 4.98% from 5.05% on Wednesday. Gold regained about half
its Wednesday loss.</TE>
<TE>   In other market action Thursday:</TE>
<TE>   * Drug maker Merck fell $1.75 to $53.20 after the firm Thursday
said the label for its cholesterol fighter Zocor had been changed to
indicate a potentially dangerous interaction with the drug Cordarone,
used to treat irregular heartbeats.</TE>
<TE>   * Another drug maker, Bristol-Myers Squibb, dropped $1.88 to
$26.20. The company's Plavix is too expensive to justify widespread
use by all heart patients, according to a study in the New England
Journal of Medicine. Bristol-Myers challenged the findings.</TE>
<TE>   * Perot Systems tumbled for the second day after a California
state senator said the computer services firm had shown energy
traders ways to manipulate the state's electricity market by
exploiting loopholes in systems it had designed. Shares of Perot
Systems fell $1.65, or 11.3%, to $12.90 after falling 19.3% on
Wednesday. Late in the session, the firm reaffirmed its financial
forecast for its current quarter and the year.</TE>
<TE>   * Investors again punished shares of conglomerate Tyco
International, sending them to a new five-year low, on reports former
Chief Executive L. Dennis Kozlowski may have used the firm's cash for
personal loans. Tyco shares fell $2.70--or more than 15%--to $14.60,
shedding more than $5.4 billion in stock market value.</TE>
<TE>   * Battered Nortel Networks closed down 19 cents at $1.41, a
19-year low. The telecom equipment supplier was expected after the
close to raise $800 million from stock and convertible securities
offerings.</TE>

<HD>NYSE Proposes New Rules for Boards</HD>
<DH>Exchange: Changes aim to increase corporate directors'
integrity and independence in wake of financial scandals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN and WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The New York Stock Exchange, seeking to restore investor confidence
that has been rocked by a spate of financial scandals, proposed new
rules Thursday aimed at increasing the independence and integrity of
corporate boards of directors.</LD>
<LD>   The changes, which were drawn up by a committee and will be voted
on by the NYSE board Aug. 1, are aimed at stemming criticism that the
exchange failed to limit conflicts of interest at energy trader Enron
Corp., formerly listed on the NYSE.</LD>
<LD>   Enron's board included directors with financial ties to the
company who failed to detect accounting irregularities that led to
the biggest U.S. bankruptcy.</LD>
<TE>   Among the major provisions, the new rules would give shareholders
at the 2,800 NYSE-listed companies the right to vote on all stock
option plans. Currently, shareholders have a say only on grants to
officers and directors, but not on broad-based programs extended to
lower-level employees.</TE>
<TE>   The NYSE proposal also would require that within two years, the
majority of a company's board members would have to be independent or
unaffiliated with the company and its management. It also would
tighten the standards to qualify as independent.</TE>
<TE>   The NYSE proposals were applauded by outside experts, who said
they would go a long way toward reining in cronyism and other abuses.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm close to overjoyed," said Nell Minow, a longtime shareholder
advocate. "I'm a professional critic by nature and by career choice,
and I find it hard to criticize anything" in the NYSE plan.</TE>
<TE>   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt also
praised the proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Still, business leaders already have voiced objections to the
stock option proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Sanger, chairman of General Mills Inc. and an official of
the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group representing major
corporations, criticized the requirement that shareholders approve
all stock compensation plans.</TE>
<TE>   Broad-based plans are used by corporations as an incentive for
employees and to "align their interest with shareholders," Sanger
wrote to NYSE Chairman Richard Grasso.</TE>
<TE>   Other parts of the proposal would:</TE>
<TE>   * Require corporate audit, nominating and compensation committees
to consist solely of independent directors, with a requirement that
the chair of the audit committee have accounting or financial
management experience. In a direct response to the Enron debacle,
audit committees would have sole responsibility to hire outside
auditors.</TE>
<TE>   * Allow the NYSE to issue public reprimand letters to companies
violating corporate-governance requirements as a way to give
investors an early warning sign of trouble. Companies that don't
comply with NYSE listing requirements can be suspended or delisted
from the exchange, but that rarely occurs.</TE>
<TE>   * Tighten the definition of an independent director, including a
five-year "cooling-off period" for former employees instead of the
current three years.</TE>
<TE>   * Require independent directors to meet regularly without
management to give them the chance to discuss sensitive issues
without feeling pressured by company executives.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the favorable response, some experts said certain
proposals should be toughened. They also worried that the overall
plan might be watered down as companies weigh in with their
objections during a two-month public comment period.</TE>
<TE>   "They went a long way," said Charles Elson, director of the Center
for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. "On the other
hand, they could have gone further."</TE>
<TE>   For example, former employees could qualify as independent
directors if they have been retired for five years and don't have a
material financial relationship with the company.</TE>
<TE>   But "independent means no financial relationship to the company at
all," Elson said. He also would prefer that at least 80% of a
company's directors be independent.</TE>
<TE>   The stock option provision also contains a potentially significant
loophole, some experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, option grants of so-called treasury shares would
not be subjected to shareholder votes. These are shares the company
purchases in periodic stock buybacks and later doles out in the form
of options.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say that could be a way for chief executives to accumulate
large numbers of options at company expense without shareholder
approval.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like saying [to shareholders], 'Here's this great
sandwich, but we're going to take a couple of bites out of it first,'
" said Patrick McGurn, vice president at Institutional Shareholder
Services, an investment consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq Stock Market forwarded its own corporate governance
proposal to the SEC on Thursday, but it was widely panned as falling
short of the NYSE offering.</TE>
<TE>   On stock options, for example, Nasdaq would require shareholder
votes only for grants that include officers and directors, not
broader programs for other workers.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say that would dilute shareholder ownership and run the
risk that only top executives would obtain options.</TE>
<TE>   But Edward Knight, Nasdaq general counsel, pointed out that Nasdaq
will consider an even tougher plan next month.</TE>

<HD>Perot Says Firm Acted Within Law</HD>
<DH>Energy: Subpoena issued to company that showed electricity
suppliers how to take advantage of holes in state's system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has subpoenaed Perot Systems Corp.
for more information about the company's role in marketing techniques
to exploit weaknesses in the state's electricity markets--an activity
that Chairman H. Ross Perot described Thursday as legal and
sanctioned by state power grid officials.</LD>
<LD>   Perot's firm, which helped develop the computer systems for the
California Power Exchange and the California Independent System
Operator, shifted into overdrive Thursday as it tried to repair
damage to its reputation and stock price, which fell an additional
11%, on top of a 19% drop the day before.</LD>
<LD>   Perot Systems' stock closed Thursday at $12.90 a share, down $1.65
on the New York Stock Exchange. In all, the Plano, Texas, computer
services company lost about $539 million in market value Wednesday
and Thursday after state Sen. Joseph Dunn (D-Santa Ana) released a
44-page computerized sales presentation produced by Perot Systems'
energy services unit, touting ways to boost profits in California's
electricity markets by taking advantage of holes in state market
rules or protocols.</LD>
<TE>   Specific bidding practices to affect power prices are discussed in
the document. On one page, the document says, "Gaps in the protocols
provide for opportunities for increased profits." Elsewhere it notes,
"Bid capacity in one market and withhold in others."</TE>
<TE>   The document unleashed a political uproar, and Gov. Gray Davis
called on federal regulators to investigate the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Perot said in the two days since the document was
released to The Times, the firm had contacted six or seven former
employees from its disbanded energy services unit. He said current
and former executives would cooperate in the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Perot, a two-time U.S. presidential candidate, said his company
developed the energy marketing techniques based on publicly available
information about California's deregulated energy market--including
filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</TE>
<TE>   He said his company had no inside track on information based on
the work it did for Cal-ISO and the now-defunct California Power
Exchange, which consisted of serving as project manager for the
massive software-development effort, integrating computer systems,
helping identify weaknesses in the system and developing solutions
for them.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to set the record straight and everybody is free to come
down and look with a microscope or whatever they want to bring and
when they're done they're not going to find that we did anything
wrong," Perot said.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer's spokeswoman declined to comment because the
investigation is continuing. Perot said he telephoned Lockyer on
Thursday to assure him of the company's cooperation. Perot also
telephoned Dunn on Wednesday and offered to testify before Dunn's
committee, which is investigating price manipulation in California's
energy markets.</TE>
<TE>   Perot said in the conference call with Wall Street analysts
Thursday and in a subsequent interview that the company he founded in
1988 shared no confidential information with market participants but
instead was making sales presentations about a software it intended
to develop to help power sellers "trade better" and "follow the
rules" in California's newly deregulated energy market.</TE>
<TE>   Although the document released by Dunn bears no date, Perot
Systems was making presentations to utilities and power sellers in
1997 and 1998 but was never successful in selling its product,
company executives said.</TE>
<TE>   California officials, he said, are looking for a scapegoat for
their market's problems.</TE>
<TE>   Russell Freeman, Perot Systems' chief financial officer, said the
company is unsure who produced the document, but market experts
formerly employed by the company have assured them that these were
old loopholes that had been corrected by the time the document was
written.</TE>
<TE>   Perot Systems received written permission in 1997 in a series of
letters from Cal-ISO's executive director at the time, Jeffrey
Tranen, to make similar presentations to market participants,
according to company executives. However, Cal-ISO stipulated that no
confidential information could be disclosed and an "ethical wall"
would have to be erected to prevent the sharing of such information.</TE>
<TE>   The letters setting the terms for the marketing effort were
included in a document filed Thursday with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. In the initial letter, dated Oct. 22, 1997,
Tranen said Cal-ISO had received complaints that Perot Systems was
attempting to teach market participants "to exploit the new
California energy market by exploiting potential weaknesses and
shortcomings in the ISO's system to their commercial advantage."</TE>
<TE>   If Perot Systems were to use inside knowledge gleaned from working
at Cal-ISO, that would violate a confidentiality agreement, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cal-ISO lawyer Charles Robinson said everyone involved in those
negotiations has left the nonprofit company and "I can't second-guess
past management."</TE>
<TE>   Although Cal-ISO officials think the Perot marketing presentation
contains no proprietary information, they have not analyzed it
closely enough to determine if Perot Systems was pointing out
weaknesses that existed at the time or was merely giving examples of
past loopholes that were plugged, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn was not satisfied by Perot's explanations.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Perot was speaking to the investment community ... in a
desperate attempt to avoid the death spiral in his stock," Dunn said.
"Perot Systems set up the computer system and knew of its errors and
marketed it to the market participants. That was wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Cal-ISO, whose board included power sellers, was not in a position
to give its blessing to such sales presentations, he said. Cal-ISO
"doesn't see itself as a regulator, it sees itself as a facilitator,"
Dunn said.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn said claims that the loopholes were fixed is "total Perot
Systems fantasyland" because Enron Corp. used similar games to fake
congestion along transmission lines to boost profit.</TE>
<TE>   Perot Systems does not believe it made the sales presentation to
Enron, Freeman said. The last formal work for Enron occurred in 1994,
when Perot Systems was paid $3,000 for computer support services, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, Perot Systems announced a plan to buy back as much
as $50 million in company stock, and repeated previous earnings
guidance of 17 cents to 18 cents a share for the second quarter and
71 cents to 76 cents a share for the full year.</TE>

<HD>PUC Introduces 'Bill of Rights' for Phone Users</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The proposal would set tougher standards for all
carriers, covering privacy, billing, disclosure, other issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to relieve frustrated phone customers and rein in consumer
abuses, state regulators Thursday unveiled a "Telecommunications
Consumer Bill of Rights" containing tougher minimum standards for
wired and wireless carriers in California.</LD>
<LD>   The new rules, more than two years in the making, are designed to
address mounting complaints from customers about billing problems,
customer service, misleading sales pitches and other ills.</LD>
<LD>   Existing rules governing phone companies are inadequate, cryptic
and buried in indecipherable government filings, said consumer groups
and Carl Wood, a member of the California Public Utilities Commission
and the driving force behind the regulatory overhaul.</LD>
<TE>   Wood's proposal sets--for the first time--minimum standards for
phone companies in the state and applies them to all carriers,
including long-distance, local, prepaid phone card and mobile-phone
service providers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is a huge deal," said Michael Shames, executive
director of the Utility Consumers' Reform Network, a San Diego-based
consumer group. "From the consumer point of view, creating a
comprehensive set of guidelines for telecommunications is about eight
years overdue."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed telecommunications rules would require carriers to:</TE>
<TE>   * Fully disclose all relevant rates, terms and conditions of
service in clear language and in readable type size.</TE>
<TE>   * Protect consumer records and personal information from misuse
and unauthorized disclosure.</TE>
<TE>   * Provide accurate and understandable bills that clearly label
products, services, fees and the names of carriers providing the
services, and provide prompt and fair redress for billing problems.</TE>
<TE>   * Treat all similarly situated customers equally, free of
prejudice or disadvantage.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the rules would require the PUC to promote consumer
participation in rule making and public policy matters that affect
them, and to provide effective recourse to consumers if their rights
are violated.</TE>
<TE>   The rules would apply to all carriers in California with more than
$10 million in annual revenue and would protect residential and
small-business customers. The PUC would enforce the measures and
could levy fines of $5,000 to $25,000 for each violation, Wood said.</TE>
<TE>   SBC Pacific Bell, the largest local phone company in California,
said it supports the proposal by Wood.</TE>
<TE>   "Having rules that treat all the companies in the industry the
same ... we think that's good for consumers," SBC spokesman John
Britton said.</TE>
<TE>   "Undoubtedly there will be a couple of areas we will want to
discuss with the commission, but we think he's expressed some good
ideas today."</TE>
<TE>   The wireless industry, however, is expected to raise strenuous
objections.</TE>
<TE>   "I am fairly sure that we will get a lot of resistance from the
mobile carriers, which enjoys exemptions from a lot of regulations
that everybody else faces," Wood said.</TE>
<TE>   But he pointed out that wireless phone service is playing a larger

<TE>   Susan Pedersen, executive director of the Cellular Carriers Assn.

<HD>Liberties Group Sues Studios Over Consumers' Use of Digital
Devices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A civil-liberties group sued the major Hollywood studios and
television networks Thursday in a bid to define consumers'
TV-recording rights for the digital age.</LD>
<LD>   In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, the
Electronic Frontier Foundation asked a federal judge to declare that
consumers can use digital recorders to watch shows after they are
broadcast, skip all commercials, transmit recordings to members of
their households and send copies of free TV broadcasts to anyone on
the Internet as long as they are not compensated.</LD>
<LD>   The complaint is a counterpunch to a copyright-infringement
lawsuit that 28 studios and networks filed against Sonicblue Inc. and
its latest digital video recorder, the ReplayTV 4000. In fact, the
foundation wants the two cases merged.</LD>
<TE>   Like other manufacturers' "personal video recorders," the ReplayTV
4000 stores TV programs on a hard drive instead of videotape. Unlike
its competitors, however, the ReplayTV 4000 can skip commercials
automatically when playing back a show, and it can beam shows to
other ReplayTV 4000s--two features that enable users to violate
copyrights, the entertainment companies say.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which focuses on
consumer rights in cyberspace, accused the entertainment industry of
using the Sonicblue lawsuit to mount an indirect attack on consumers.
To win their case, the entertainment companies must prove that
consumers don't have the right to skip commercials or shift copies of
their recordings to other devices, said Fred von Lohmann, the
foundation's senior intellectual property attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers "should at least have the right to stand up in court and
defend their own activities," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the studios and networks said the foundation's
action distorted the nature of their lawsuit against Sonicblue.</TE>
<TE>   "We have never indicated any desire or intent to bring legal
action against individual consumers for use of this device," the
companies said in a joint statement.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyer Robert M. Schwartz, a partner at O'Melveny &amp; Myers who
represents the studios, said: "We will show to the court that this
device is designed to directly infringe our copyrights and do other
things that aren't fair use. We don't have to show that individual
users are acting improperly."</TE>
<TE>   The foundation brought its lawsuit on behalf of five ReplayTV 4000
owners who say they use their recorders to limit the commercials
their children see, move recordings around their home and even send
shows to their laptops--a feature not designed or supported by
Sonicblue.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts said the complaint would not move forward unless the
five consumers can show they were at imminent risk of being sued by
the studios and networks for copyright infringement.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the foundation said they were simply trying to ensure
that consumers could use digital recorders to do things they had
grown accustomed to doing with their VCRs. But other copyright
lawyers said the legal waters were not that clear, particularly when
it comes to sending copies of shows from device to device.</TE>
<TE>   In a landmark 1984 opinion, the Supreme Court rejected the
studios' legal challenge to Sony Corp.'s Betamax VCR and ruled that
consumers could record programs for later viewing. But the case did
not consider whether consumers could copy a program and send it over
the Internet, said J.D. Harriman, a copyright attorney at Coudert
Bros. in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Nor have the courts addressed whether consumers have the right to
skip commercials. But Maureen Dorney, a partner at the law firm Gray
Cary in Palo Alto, said the studios would be hard pressed to prove
consumers were "doing something wrongful because they get up and go
to the bathroom."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about the rights of consumers; it's about the unlawful
conduct of the manufacturer of this box," Schwartz responded. "The
manufacturer of this box does not have the right to sell a device
that electronically and instantly bypasses the commercials."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the foundation's complaint is thrown out, observers
agreed, the Sonicblue case could influence what consumers can do with
the new digital recorders.</TE>
<TE>   "This case has the potential for making some important law,"
Dorney said.</TE>

<HD>R.J. Reynolds Fined for Ads Aimed at Teens</HD>
<DH>Tobacco: Judgment of $20 million for magazine pitches is
first financial penalty for violation of 1998 national settlement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION and MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A San Diego judge fined R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. $20 million
Thursday after finding that the nation's No. 2 cigarette maker was
targeting teenagers by advertising Camels and other brands in
magazines such as InStyle, Spin and Hot Rod.</LD>
<LD>   The fine is the first financial penalty imposed for a violation of
the 1998 settlement of lawsuits against tobacco firms filed by the
attorneys general of 46 states. Under that settlement, the cigarette
makers pledged to pay the states $246 million over 25 years.</LD>
<LD>   At issue in this case was the companies' agreement to take no
action, "directly or indirectly, to target youth." Although the 1998
settlement made no specific mention of magazine advertising,
California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer charged RJR last year with
breaching the agreement by placing ads in magazines popular with
readers under age 18.</LD>
<TE>   San Diego County Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Prager agreed that
such advertisements violated that ban, and he ordered RJR to "reduce
youth exposure" to its cigarette ads and to demonstrate its
compliance.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer said the ruling would help meet one of the key goals of
the tobacco litigation and settlement, which was to keep children
from taking up smoking. "When hundreds of your customers die every
day, the only way to stay in business is to hook new ones," he said.
"But targeting children in your quest for new consumers is unlawful,
shameful and will not be tolerated in California."</TE>
<TE>   RJR's top lawyer said the company would appeal, and he maintained
that its advertising strategy complies with the settlement by
avoiding any publication that draws 25% or more of its readership
from youths.</TE>
<TE>   "The attorney general conceded that we have no specific intent to
target youth with magazine advertising, and that we do not
purposefully attempt to expose youth to our advertising," said
Charles Blixt, RJR's general counsel. This ruling "says that if we
advertise in magazines whose readership is overwhelmingly adults and
some kids may see cigarette advertising in the magazine, that is a
violation of the provision that we do nothing to target youth.</TE>
<TE>   "It's inconsistent with the agreement," Blixt said. "It's
inconsistent with the law, and it's inconsistent with our 1st
Amendment right to advertise to adults in these magazines."</TE>
<TE>   Anti-smoking organizations hailed the ruling as a sign that the
1998 settlement will be vigorously enforced.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a shot across the bow to R.J. Reynolds," said Matt Myers,
president of the Washington-based National Center for Tobacco Free
Kids. "This decision gives real teeth to the settlement agreement's
prohibitions against marketing to children and is a critical judicial
finding that R.J. Reynolds continued to target kids long after the
settlement."</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the November 1998 settlement, tobacco companies
imposed their own guidelines for curtailing the number of readers
under 18 who might see pitches for cigarettes. Philip Morris Cos.,
the nation's No. 1 tobacco company, pledged to refrain from
advertising in magazines with more than 15% youth readership. Brown &amp;
Williamson Tobacco Corp. said it observes a 15% limit. Lorillard
Tobacco said it restricts its ads to magazines with 18% or less youth
readership.</TE>
<TE>   With the highest self-imposed limit of 25% youth readers, Reynolds
is viewed by Lockyer's office as the most aggressive of the tobacco
companies in its tactics for pitching its brands.</TE>
<TE>   "They're always pushing the envelope as to what they can get away
with," said one attorney in Lockyer's office, "so as a result they're
going to get sued more."</TE>
<TE>   RJR's Blixt said the attorneys general failed in an attempt to
obtain specific magazine advertising limits during negotiations that
led to the 1998 settlement. "The attorney general is trying to
litigate to get more than was gotten through negotiation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The $20-million sanction is the fourth victory in the last 18
months for Lockyer against RJR. Last month, a Los Angeles judge
ordered RJR to pay fines of $15 million for handing out free
cigarettes at the Pomona fairgrounds and other locations where
children were present. State law limits the free distribution of
cigarettes to places that are off-limits to minors.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer also had sued RJR over ad signs posted at car-racing
venues. The state claimed the ads violated the national tobacco
settlement. Prager agreed and ordered the signs to come down but
assessed no fine. In January 2001, Lockyer's office reached a
settlement with RJR concerning its disputed practice of mailing
cigarettes to consumers without determining that they were at least
18.</TE>
<TE>   Prager is presiding over two class-action lawsuits filed against
tobacco companies on behalf of California cigarette buyers. One,
which is set for trial next month, demands the tobacco firms refund
the money underage buyers spent on cigarettes from 1995 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said neither the fine levied Thursday nor a curtailment
of magazine advertising would harm the $6.6-billion company. "This is
not a big deal," said Bonnie Herzog, an analyst with Salomon Smith
Barney. "In principle it's a big deal to them, so they are going to
appeal."</TE>
<TE>   But even if RJR loses on appeal and is forced to pull some of its
magazine ads, Herzog said the effect would be minimal because such
print campaigns are a small part of its marketing strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Winston-Salem, N.C.-based R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings
Inc. fell $1.08 to $68.71 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>As Wall St. Worries Mount, Even Stock Stalwarts Waver</HD>
<DH>Markets: Stronger sectors are pulling back, causing some to
question recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the major stock indexes falling recently to within sight of
their September lows, some of the market's bastions of strength over
the last year are finally showing signs of buckling.</LD>
<LD>   Although there are scattered glimmers of hope that the market may
soon regain its footing, analysts see few positives on the horizon as
investors brace for the start of Wall Street's traditional summer
doldrums.</LD>
<LD>   The gloom deepened on Wall Street Thursday as the same concerns
that have dogged the market for months--corporate accounting, global
political tensions, tepid earnings, the falling dollar, Wall Street
scandals--combined to push the market to its lowest levels since
October and uncomfortably close to the three-year lows hit Sept. 21
after the first week of trading following the September terrorist
attacks.</LD>
<TE>   "The market is being 'T.A.R.R.E.D.' by terrorism, accounting,
research, regulators, earnings and the dollar," said Sam Stovall,
investment strategist at Standard &amp; Poor's in New York. "There's so
much going on that I have to make up an acronym to remember it all."</TE>
<TE>   Most troubling to some analysts is the wavering of what had been
bulwarks in an otherwise rickety market--stocks of small and mid-size
companies, for example, and retailing shares. A pullback in smaller
stocks, which had been enjoying a quiet bull market this year as
major indexes remained stuck in a two-year downturn, and a drop in
many retail stocks could be a warning that the economy is not gaining
as much strength as many investors expect, some analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "The small- and mid-cap rally has mainly been based on the premise
of an economic rebound. That premise is now in question," said Chip
Hanlon, president of investment firm Unfunds Inc. in Huntington
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   From their mid-April peaks, the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 index has dropped
9.9% and the S&amp;P MidCap 400 index is off 8.3%.</TE>
<TE>   "Small-cap value stocks, in particular, have been the most
consistently strong part of the market for the last year, but they
have backed off in the last 30 days," said Paul Rabbitt, president of
Rabbitt Analytics in Hermosa Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Seasonal trends could be taking a toll on smaller stocks along
with big names, analysts say, as the market's summer doldrums may be
looming. June, August and September historically are among the
weakest for the market, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac.</TE>
<TE>   Hanlon notes that the retail sector has softened, even though
industry leader Wal-Mart Stores Inc. rallied earlier this week after
reporting robust May sales. Wal-Mart is down 15.1% from its 52-week
peak in mid-March, and Target Corp. and Home Depot are off from their
late-February highs. "This could be signaling that the consumer is
going to run out of gas in the second half of the year," Hanlon said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, weak sectors--in particular telecom and chip
stocks--remain weak. A key index of semiconductor makers has fallen
29% in the last three months, and the Amex telecom index is down 32%
over the same period.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the sector that has been leading the market this
year--gold stocks--generally is out front at times when the rest of
the market is in turmoil.</TE>
<TE>   Some investment pros say smaller stocks may resume their superior
performance.</TE>
<TE>   James Stack, president of InvesTech Research in Whitefish, Mont.,
said he is still "guardedly and selectively bullish" on smaller
stocks and on value stocks. Stack noted that year to date, S&amp;P's
small- and mid-cap indexes are practically flat--not exciting, but
better than the large-cap S&amp;P 500 index's 10.4% loss so far this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Some argue, however, that the decline in smaller stocks, while not
representing a breakdown of the broader market, marks the early stage
of a shift toward larger names leading the way once again.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbitt said there are several reasons to expect such a "paradigm
shift," including: weakness in the dollar, which could benefit large
multinational companies as they translate overseas profit;
uncertainty as tensions flare in the Mideast and in South Asia, which
may send investors to the perceived safety of large and liquid
stocks; and "the closing of the valuation gap" that had made smaller
stocks more attractive than larger stocks. Their share-price strength
over the last two years has made small-caps just as expensive as
big-caps relative to company earnings, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to investors' troubles is Stovall's list of woes: threats
of new terror attacks; the accounting scandal highlighted by Enron's
collapse; distrust of Wall Street research analysts; regulators'
probe into alleged conflicts of interest at brokerages; a lack of
companies guiding profit forecasts higher with gusto; and a weakening
dollar that could drive foreign investors away from U.S. securities.</TE>
<TE>   Stovall and his colleagues at S&amp;P's investment policy committee
voted this week to cut recommended equity exposure by 5 percentage
points to 55% and to raise cash allocation to 25% from 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Stack said that although the market offers opportunities for savvy
stock pickers, he believes there is "much more pain ahead" for the
major Nasdaq names reeling from a lack of demand for technology and
telecom products.</TE>
<TE>   How much pain? At Thursday's close of 1,554.88, the tech-heavy
Nasdaq composite index is within 9% of its three-year low of 1,423.19
reached Sept. 21.</TE>

<HD>Toyota to Add Assembly Site in Southland</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Toyota Motor Manufacturing Co. said Thursday that it will establish
Southern California's first new vehicle assembly plant in half a
century at the site of its pickup truck-bed manufacturing plant in
Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The facility will begin assembling medium-duty commercial panel
trucks for Toyota subsidiary Hino Motors in 2004, when the truck-bed
manufacturing operation is moved to a new Toyota plant being built
just outside Tijuana.</LD>
<LD>   Bringing the Hino operation to Long Beach will preserve about 550
jobs and an annual payroll of $38.5 million, Toyota said.</LD>
<TE>   "This is Hino's first North American operation and it marks the
reemergence of vehicle production in Southern California," said
Dennis Cuneo, senior vice president of Indiana-based Toyota Motor
Manufacturing, the Toyota Motor Corp. unit that operates the Long
Beach facility.</TE>
<TE>   Revamping the plant for vehicle production is expected to
represent an investment of several hundred million dollars for
Toyota.</TE>
<TE>   Although a number of specialty companies build cars in Southern
California, auto production by major car makers stopped in 1992 with
the closure of General Motors Corp.'s assembly plant in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota will assemble 4,000 Hino trucks a year in Long Beach, Cuneo
said, which is twice as many as the company currently sells in the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Cuneo would not say whether the truck company plans to expand U.S.
sales or to export some of the production from the Long Beach
facility.</TE>
<TE>   Hino competes in a Japanese truck market that has seen little
growth in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   It is moving the truck-bed production to Baja California as part
of a previously announced plan to establish a major production
facility there, its first in Mexico. But the Long Beach plant, Cuneo
said, remains "very much a part of our long term future."</TE>

<HD>Wal-Mart to Expand L.A. Presence</HD>
<DH>Retail: Harbor Gateway property would add to growing list
of new sites. 40 Supercenters in the state also are planned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is launching its most serious expansion into
America's major urban areas, with Los Angeles at the top of the
company's list.</LD>
<LD>   The world's biggest retailer is in the early stages of acquiring
land for a store in the city's Harbor Gateway area, a Wal-Mart
executive told The Times on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The site, near 190th Street and Normandie Avenue south of Gardena
and east of Torrance, has been vacant for several years, said a
representative of City Councilwoman Janice Hahn, who represents the
area.</LD>
<TE>   That property would add to a growing list of new Wal-Mart sites
within big-city borders, including a Baldwin Hills-Crenshaw Plaza
store due to open this fall. Last month, the company also said it
would open 40 Supercenters--a hybrid discount store and
supermarket--in California over the next four to six years. Dallas is
another big city Wal-Mart is targeting for expansion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a risk, but it's also the next logical step for Wal-Mart,"
said Jeffrey Klinefelter, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't have to rely on the 70% market share they get in a
small community anymore. With population density, they can get away
with 15% market share in some locations."</TE>
<TE>   The newest Wal-Mart prospect still is in the earliest stages, said
Robert S. McAdam, Wal-Mart's vice president of state and local
government relations. The company has filed a preliminary proposal to
open a store on the site, but has not finalized its land purchase, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great market area," McAdam said. "We're looking at
opportunities in more urban areas because those are markets we
haven't served."</TE>
<TE>   The aide to Hahn said the planned 150,000-square-foot Wal-Mart
would be a boon to the area. In addition to adding about 300 jobs in
the region, the store would be a retail destination in what had been
a blighted plot, the aide said.</TE>
<TE>   Urban expansion is among topics expected to be addressed by
Wal-Mart's senior leadership today at the company's annual meeting in
Bentonville, Ark., where it is based.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart began its march to retail supremacy by serving rural
communities, most of which had few, if any, retail outlets within
dozens or even hundreds of miles. Then Wal-Mart inched toward the
nation's cities by establishing a foothold in suburban America.</TE>
<TE>   California was always Wal-Mart's domestic frontier. After opening
its first store in the state about a decade ago, the chain expanded
to areas around major California cities and then into city outskirts,
such as one store in Panorama City.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the 40 Wal-Mart Supercenters planned for California
probably are the first of what could become more than 100
Wal-Mart-owned stores in the state, including the discount Wal-Mart
stores, Sam's Club warehouse stores and the combination Supercenters.</TE>

<HD>50 Views of Santa Clara Valley</HD>
<DH>Art: Museum exhibit, opening today, features paintings
chronicling scenes of a region that is still largely connected to
agriculture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZIE ST. JOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A three-year effort to capture the beauty of the Santa Clara Valley
will pay off today when the latest exhibit at the Ventura County
Museum of History and Art opens.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 50 oils, watercolors and pastels by 18 local painters will
be on display through Sept. 1 in the show "Painting the Santa Clara
Valley." The pieces attempt to capture the flavor of a valley that
follows the Santa Clara River from Ventura through Saticoy to Saugus
in Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   Museum visitors can view images of Mission San Buenaventura,
cultivated fields and orchards, produce stands, field workers and
horse corrals with mountain backdrops.</LD>
<TE>   The artwork was selected from the recently released book "The
Santa Clara Valley" published by the Easton Gallery in Montecito. The
book features 100 paintings and includes a comprehensive history of
the valley written by Judith P. Triem, the Santa Paula historian who
wrote "Ventura County: Land of Good Fortune."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Schiffer, the museum's executive director, admitted it is
unusual to base an exhibit on a book from a gallery, but said the
idea fits with the museum's vision.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt it was important for people to realize how remarkable it
is to have this incredible valley with so much history," said
Schiffer, who wrote the book's introduction. "There aren't many
valleys that have so much agriculture left.</TE>
<TE>   "With everything in a state of change, this exhibit gives you a
way to take stock of those changes. It's an appreciation."</TE>
<TE>   Local painter Susan Petty said she and her fellow artists tried to
learn about the valley's history in addition to creating the art.
That sometimes required getting permission from land owners to paint
on their property.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really interesting, because you have different artists
with different approaches, and what fascinates one might not catch
another," said Petty, who lives on a lemon and avocado ranch in
Saticoy. "Some of the things that were painted aren't there anymore,
so it's nice to have preserved history through the paintings."</TE>
<TE>   Petty said she is often inspired by the view from her porch.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of the things I paint, I think to myself that I better paint
this before it's gone or covered up," Petty said. "One of the biggest
changes has been between Santa Paula and Piru, where it used to be a
major orange-growing area. Now the area is changing to nurseries
because there is less and less money in growing oranges."</TE>
<TE>   An opening reception for the exhibition is scheduled from 5 to 9
p.m. and coincides with Ventura's "First Friday: Alive after Five"
program, when downtown retailers, restaurants, galleries and
businesses at Ventura Harbor stay open until 9 p.m. the first Friday
of the month. The reception is free, but reservations are required.</TE>
<TE>   The museum will offer several special events during the exhibit's
three-month run. Gallery talks with selected exhibition artists are
scheduled June 23 at 1 and 3 p.m.; Steve Bachman, the United Water
Conservation District's ground water manager, will lecture on valley
geology July 11 at 7 p.m.; Cal State Channel Islands history
professor Frank Barajas will lecture on "Recruitment and Restriction:
The Changing Work Force of Ventura County" July 18 at 7 p.m.; and
rancher and environmentalist Sanford Hedrick Jr. will speak on
restoring the valley's ecosystem July 25 at 7 p.m. Admission is $5
per event and reservations are required.</TE>
<TE>   While half of the Santa Clara Valley book focuses on paintings,
the other half features a geological examination of the valley by
Bachman. Aerial photographs by William B. Dewey accompany the section
and some of those photos also will be displayed in the show.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope this exhibit deepens the appreciation people have for the
valley," Petty said. "It's a nice, concise history, and it's
wonderful to have it preserved this way."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County Museum of History and Art, 100 E. Main St.,
Ventura, is open Tuesdays through Sundays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Admission is $4 for adults, $3 for seniors and $1 for children ages
6-17. Museum members and children younger than 5 get in free. For
more information, call 653-0353.</TE>

<HD>Feds Outline Kidnapping Charges</HD>
<DH>Crime: Prosecutors reveal some details of brutal killings
of five area residents whose bodies were found in a reservoir. Two
additional suspects are named.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU and RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As far as killers go, they were particularly brutal: When a plastic
bag didn't asphyxiate one victim, an abductor found a bigger bag for
his head. And as far as kidnappers go, they were rip-off artists,
demanding ransom even after their victims were dead.</LD>
<LD>   Federal prosecutors made these accusations Thursday in the case of
an international abduction scheme they said led to the deaths of five
Southland residents whose bodies were dragged from New Melones
Reservoir in Northern California.</LD>
<LD>   Seven men--all with roots in the former Soviet Union--have been
charged in connection with the kidnappings, and on Thursday the U.S.
attorney's office named two other suspects.</LD>
<TE>   One, Aleksejus Markovskis, allegedly helped detain victims in a
posh Sherman Oaks home. The other, Natalya Solovyeva, posed as an old
girlfriend to lure one victim, according to prosecutors and court
documents. Both are being held by immigration authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a federal judge Thursday accepted the guilty plea of
one defendant, Ainar Altmanis, 42, of Sherman Oaks, who led
authorities to the bodies. In exchange for his plea to conspiracy and
kidnapping charges, prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Other defendants in the kidnap-for-ransom case include Petro
Krylov, 29, of West Hollywood, and Encino residents Iouri Mikhel, 37,
and Jurijus Kadamovas, 35. They face the death penalty if convicted
because the abductions resulted in death. Andrei Agueev, 34, and
Andrei Liapine, 41, face lesser charges of receiving ransom money.
The two men, who were living in the United Arab Emirates when
arrested, face a maximum 10 years in prison. All have pleaded not
guilty. Russian businessman Alexandr Afonin is still at large.</TE>
<TE>   The new court papers filed Thursday prior to Altmanis' plea gave
the most detailed glimpse yet of a crude blueprint: Kidnap well-off
businesspeople. Demand money. Then kill them.</TE>
<TE>   The case outlined by prosecutors began taking shape last fall,
when Altmanis agreed to help Mikhel and Kadamovas kidnap Meyer
Muscatel, a successful Sherman Oaks developer who was last seen Oct.
11, when he told his wife he was going out for a meeting.</TE>
<TE>   According to court papers, the three men lured Muscatel to
Mikhel's home, a manor on a hilly Encino street. Muscatel, 58, fought
with his abductors but was pistol-whipped and tied up.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, records say, the abductors forced Muscatel to try to
transfer money out of his bank account.</TE>
<TE>   According to Altmanis' plea agreement, he stopped by the house
late, and saw Muscatel alive near Kadamovas' van.</TE>
<TE>   Though a bag had been tied around his head, he was still
convulsing.</TE>
<TE>   According to the document, Altmanis watched as Mikhel placed a
bigger bag over Muscatel's head and held his nose. Mikhel and
Kadamovas then loaded Muscatel's body into the van and drove away.</TE>
<TE>   They later said they dumped the body in a lake in the Sierra
Nevada, according to the documents.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 2001, Kadamovas began keeping tabs on another
potential victim, George Safiev, 37, a Russian banking magnate who
had moved to Beverly Hills, and his associate, aspiring film producer
Nick Kharabadze, 29, of Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The new documents filed by prosecutors give the following story:
Over several months, Kadamovas and Mikhel began gathering information
about the two and planned to abduct Safiev for ransom. Krylov kept a
map marked with an "X" to show where Kharabadze lived, as well as a
list of the cars driven by his family.</TE>
<TE>   The kidnappers first tried to lure Safiev by abducting his
bookkeeper, Rita Pekler, 39, and demanding she arrange a meeting in
December. When that failed, they killed Pekler.</TE>
<TE>   Then the kidnappers turned their attention to North Hollywood
businessman Alexander Umansky, 35, whose high income from his
electronics business had been brought to their attention by Krylov, a
former employee of Umansky's.</TE>
<TE>   Mikhel posed as a potential customer and brought Umansky to
Kadamovas' Sherman Oaks house. There, Umansky found Altmanis and
Kadamovas pointing guns at him.</TE>
<TE>   Mikhel and Kadamovas tied Umansky to a chair and forced him to
call his brother for ransom money, to be wired to a bank account in
Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   After his family sent $89,598, Mikhel, Kadamovas and Altmanis
suffocated Umansky.</TE>
<TE>   After Umansky's body was dumped in the same Northern California
lake as Muscatel and Pekler, Mikhel arranged for an unknown suspect
to contact Umansky's family to demand more money.</TE>
<TE>   It was eventually wired back to the United States to the bank
account of Designed Water World, an upscale aquarium business in
Encino run by Mikhel and Kadamovas.</TE>
<TE>   Mikhel and Kadamovas then turned their attention back to Safiev,
according to prosecutors and court documents. Prosecutors also allege
that on Jan. 18 of this year, Natalya Solovyeva--who was Kadamovas'
girlfriend--lured Kharabadze to Designed Water World, where several
of the suspects forced him to call Safiev to ask him to come.</TE>
<TE>   Safiev arrived alone.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next few days, the kidnappers forced Safiev to call a
business associate in London to transfer $969,000 from his Singapore
account to a Miami account.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 25, both Safiev and Kharabadze were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Six days later, one or more of the alleged kidnappers called
Safiev's business associate to demand $4 million more in ransom.</TE>
<TE>   Although Muscatel's body was pulled from the Northern California
lake Oct. 18, six days after he was reported missing to Los Angeles
police, his body was not identified until March, when authorities
went looking for the others in the deep, frigid waters of the Gold
Country lake.</TE>
<TE>   That month, they found the bodies of Pekler, Safiev, Kharabadze
and Umansky.</TE>

<HD>Fire Claims 6 More Homes</HD>
<DH>Firefighting: More than 15,000 acres are burned and 1,100
residents evacuated, some to high schools in Palmdale and Saugus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL CHAMBERS, MICHAEL KRIKORIAN and ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A wind-whipped brush fire burned out of control in northern Los
Angeles County on Thursday, scorching more than 15,600 acres,
damaging high-voltage power lines and prompting officials to evacuate
at least 1,100 residents from their houses and small ranches in Green
Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Six houses were destroyed Thursday by the fire, which also burned
through a home Wednesday a few hours after the blaze started about
2:30 p.m. No one had been seriously hurt as of late Thursday, though
several firefighters suffered minor injuries, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The fire, which began on Copper Hill in San Francisquito Canyon,
picked up momentum as it burned through thick brush in the Angeles
National Forest. Flames were fueled by high winds, triple-digit
temperatures and low humidity, fire officials said. The blaze, which
authorities said was of suspicious origin, was roughly 5% contained
by 8 p.m. Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   "It's horrible, ashes falling everywhere, the sun was blood-red
and the house was pitch-black,'' said Steve Jolliffe, 33, a Green
Valley homeowner who with his wife, Sonya, was evacuated to Saugus
High School. "The houses are empty up there. It was eerie."</TE>
<TE>   More than 2,000 firefighters from across Southern California were
aided by water-dropping helicopters and fixed-wing air tankers, said
L.A. County Fire Inspector Mike Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Over the two-day period five firefighters reported minor injuries,
including cuts and heat cramps, Brown said. Fire officials evacuated
500 homes, a camp used primarily by firefighter inmates and two Los
Angeles County Probation Department camps in Lake Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Fire Inspector Kurt Schaefer said fire
officials were investigating the cause of the blaze. ''We can't say
it was arson and can't say it wasn't arson," said Schaefer, who added
that inspectors have determined the fire began near a construction
site just north of Copper Hill Drive, west of McBean Parkway in
Valencia.</TE>
<TE>   The California Highway Patrol closed San Francisquito Canyon Road,
Elizabeth Lake Road, Bouquet Canyon Road and Spunky Canyon Road.
Evacuation sites were set up at Highland High School in Palmdale and
Saugus High.</TE>
<TE>   Off San Francisquito Canyon Road, a half-mile from the center of
town, flames leaped 200 feet, threatening to jump the road. Suddenly,
the wind shifted. Within seconds, the side of a small mountain was
ablaze.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big one,'' said Jim Snow, a 26-year veteran of the U.S.
Forest Service. ''It's just so dry. It's up to the wind now.''</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters could not save six homes Thursday. The day before,
eight structures were lost, including a house in San Francisquito
Canyon and seven sheds, barns and other outbuildings.</TE>
<TE>   Smoke from flames, rising as high as 50 feet, damaged two
high-voltage power transmission lines, which were briefly shut down.
But state power officials said the damage had no effect on customers
because supplies were rerouted.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters continued their assault Thursday on a fast-moving
wildfire that has scorched nearly 20,000 acres in the Los Padres
National Forest north of Ojai and is now threatening ancient Native
American ruins and the habitat of several endangered animals.</TE>
<TE>   The Wolf Fire is believed to already have burned the habitat of
two endangered species--the arroyo toad and steelhead trout. A huge
wall of fire--four football fields wide and 100 feet high in some
areas--showed no signs of slowing Thursday after it cut a furious
path east through the Sespe Wilderness on Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   With more than 1,700 firefighters battling the blaze, the six-day
Wolf Fire has cost state and county agencies more than $4 million.
The fire was 15% contained.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the blaze sped east along six miles of peaks and
valleys near Pine Mountain Ridge and continued to burn in dozens of
hot spots in the Sespe Wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   Three smaller fires in the Angeles and San Bernardino national
forests were contained or nearly contained by Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Forest Service said the largest of the three, which
charred about 2,700 acres and destroyed two commercial buildings,
four storage sheds and a trailer in the San Bernardino Mountains
north of Lake Arrowhead, was 100% contained. Three firefighters
suffered minor injuries battling the blaze, which may have spread
from a small fire deliberately set during a training exercise a week
ago.</TE>
<TE>   A 430-acre fire that began Sunday in the San Jacinto Mountains
east of Hemet was declared fully contained. Also fully contained was
a fire in the San Gabriel Mountains that blackened about 125 acres of
chaparral on the slopes of Susana Canyon, about 15 miles north of
Azusa. Officials said that fire, which started Monday, may have been

<HD>Police Win Bias Suit Against County</HD>
<DH>Courts: Jury rules the 500-plus public safety officers, who
are mostly minorities, were discriminated against. Appeal seen as
likely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Superior Court jury Thursday unanimously decided that Los Angeles
County has racially discriminated against members of its Office of
Public Safety, a 500-plus member police force that patrols county
hospitals, parks and other facilities.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for the force, which is about 80% black, Latino and Asian,
will ask for more than $100 million in salary increases, back pay and
pension funds during the next phase of the trial.</LD>
<LD>   The officers argued that the county has operated a law-enforcement
caste system in which public safety officers were paid 40% less than
sheriff's deputies and were denied pensions equivalent to that of
deputies. The county officers risk their lives and health and have
even died performing their jobs but have historically been ridiculed
as "wannabe sheriffs" and treated like security guards, plaintiffs
said.</LD>
<TE>   They pointed out that county lifeguards get pension benefits
similar to those of police or firefighters, but county police are
among the few peace officers who do not.</TE>
<TE>   Pending a judge's ruling on the financial damages--and a likely
appeal--the civil verdict caps a nearly century-long dysfunctional
relationship between county government and its largely anonymous
police force, which was created in 1917 as a group of night watchmen.
Over the years, the force evolved from armed security guards to
unarmed security officers and finally to full-fledged peace officers.
The force was consolidated in 1997 with the merger of officers who
worked in county hospitals, parks and government buildings.</TE>
<TE>   During a two-week trial, plaintiffs' attorneys argued that the
officers have battled street gangs, restrained often-violent
psychiatric patients and lost six officers in the line of duty, but
they have been compensated more like security guards than police. The
lawyers told the jury that the pay policy was discriminatory.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the jury, a cross-section of people from Los Angeles
County, saw very clearly the institutional racism," said Jack
O'Donnell, an attorney for the public safety officers. "I thank God
the jury has taken the county to task."</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for the county countered that emotional jurors
returned a flat-out-wrong verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the emotional connection that they felt for the
officers, and that they felt they should be paid more, but the
verdict reinforces that they weren't deciding on the basis of
instructions, but on emotions," attorney Calvin House said. "I'm
convinced the county did not discriminate on the basis of race."</TE>
<TE>   O'Donnell said the county could have saved at least $35 million in
potential penalties had it settled the case rather than going to
trial.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave the county opportunities to settle and set the record
straight about these officers, and they never made the effort," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But House and county officials said the officers were asking for
too much, especially given the county's financial straits.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been saying they want to be paid the same as deputies.
That by itself is a huge economic undertaking," House said. "With the
current state of the budget, it would have been hard to settle, given
the numbers."</TE>
<TE>   An aide to Supervisor Mike Antonovich defended the county's
handling of salary negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "The Office of Public Safety does not patrol the same kind of area
that sheriff's deputies do," Jean Huston said. "Patrolling a county
park is different from patrolling South-Central Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   House said the county will ask Superior Court Judge Victor Chavez
to throw out the verdict, and failing that, will probably appeal.</TE>
<TE>   O'Donnell said county police officers patrol some of the tensest,
most volatile places in Los Angeles. At County-USC Medical Center,
officers respond to violent psychiatric patients more than a dozen
times a day, O'Donnell said. Rival gang members sometimes clash in
the hospital, officers say.</TE>
<TE>   "The county wants their cake and to eat it too. They knew they
needed police officers to do these jobs, they just didn't want to pay
cop wages and benefits," said Patricia Bellasalma, another attorney
for the officers. "If they could have gotten away with having
security guards, they would have."</TE>

<HD>Board's Extra Pay Is Assailed</HD>
<DH>Report: Ventura County Grand Jury recommends that
supervisors no longer get additional money for serving on two
committees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ventura County Grand Jury has recommended that county supervisors
be stripped of extra pay for serving on outside boards and
commissions because such jobs should be considered part of their
regular duties.</LD>
<LD>   The finding runs counter to a current policy that allows
supervisors who serve on two committees--the tax appeals and
retirement panels--to receive extra money. Supervisors earn $104,127
a year, which includes a base salary of $89,633 and benefits.</LD>
<LD>   But the panel's finding is just a recommendation, and the Board of
Supervisors is not required to do anything about it.</LD>
<TE>   "I disagree strongly with the grand jury," said Supervisor John
Flynn, who served on the tax appeals board for 25 years and earned
$400 a month to attend weekly meetings until earlier this year. "I
don't think the grand jury has an understanding of the knowledge a
person on the assessment appeals board has to have.</TE>
<TE>   "To deny $100 for attending a meeting when sometimes you're
dealing with millions and millions of dollars, it doesn't make any
sense."</TE>
<TE>   An effort led by Supervisor Steve Bennett to strip county
officials of all such supplemental pay was blunted last year when
Flynn sponsored an amendment that allows supervisors to continue
collecting extra pay for service on the two committees.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn argued that work on the tax appeals and retirement boards
requires a high degree of knowledge and experience, and that the
payments were not a big drain on the county budget.</TE>
<TE>   But the grand jury wrote in its decision that "the amendment ...
should be removed."</TE>
<TE>   "If attendance at these exempted boards is so onerous," the panel
wrote, "it would be better to alternate membership on the two boards
among all supervisors on an annual basis."</TE>
<TE>   Bennett said that he would not revive the idea in the near future.</TE>
<TE>   "I was on the losing side, so I can't revisit it soon," Bennett
said. "Sometimes you have to lose gracefully and go forward. But I
was pleased the grand jury took the exact same position. It increases
the odds of it being successful sometime. I think the grand jury
reflects public opinion."</TE>
<TE>   Flynn retired from the three-member tax appeals board in January,
saying he wanted to give others a chance to serve. He was replaced by
appointee Dave Eaton of Ventura, a retired contractor and former
county supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Frank Schillo collects $200 a month as a member of the
retirement board, which meets twice a month. He and Supervisor Judy
Mikels supported Flynn's amendment last December to continue the
supplemental payments.</TE>

<LD>The priest: Forgive me, father, for I have sinned. It has been two
weeks since my last confession.</LD>
<LD>   The monsignor: Do I see through the window that you're a man of
the cloth? Tell me your sins, father.</LD>
<LD>   Priest: I stubbed a toe and took the Lord's name in vain. I used a
quarter from the Sunday basket to feed the meter and, three years
ago, I molested a tyke.</LD>
<TE>   Monsignor: You stole a quarter from the basket?</TE>
<TE>   Priest: I pray forgiveness for all my sins.</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: Was it just one youth?</TE>
<TE>   Priest: Yes.</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: Boy or girl? Strike that. Dumb question.</TE>
<TE>   Priest: One of my altar boys, I'm sorry to say.</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: Well, you know what Leno said the other night.</TE>
<TE>   Priest: No, what?</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: Two tykes and you're out.</TE>
<TE>   Priest: Does that mean you think I'm in the clear?</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: Well, the bishops met in Washington this week and
proposed a zero-tolerance policy, with one exception.</TE>
<TE>   Priest: That's what I don't understand. If there's an exception,
how is it zero tolerance?</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: It's not, but what were you expecting from this crew?
The deal is, if you got caught only once, you might be OK.</TE>
<TE>   Priest: That's generous of them.</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: Not really. I'm guessing some of those bishops have
their own secrets, if you catch my drift. You know what they say
about casting the first stone.</TE>
<TE>   Priest: But I thought we had a different standard in Los Angeles?
Did you see Mahony's newspaper ad claiming he's got a tougher policy
than anyone?</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: And what does Mahony rhyme with? This guy's got a
different line every day. He was sliding pedophiles around the
diocese like a shuffleboard master, and now, all of a sudden, his
heart bleeds for the victims?</TE>
<TE>   Priest: With all due respect, he is the cardinal.</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: Yes, and I haven't seen tap-dancing like this since
"Going My Way." You catch the part in the ad where Mahony says that
we're like the disciples in a storm-tossed boat on the Sea of
Galilee?</TE>
<TE>   Priest: Yes.</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: If Mahony had been on the Titanic, he would have handed
out press releases saying he told the captain to watch out for
icebergs. And then he'd have been on the first lifeboat.</TE>
<TE>   Priest: Well, some of the brothers do feel like he's pointing a
finger at everyone but himself.</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: Sure, we've got a few bad apples, but I'm tired of
taking the fall. You know what really got us into this jam?</TE>
<TE>   Priest: Pray tell, Monsignor.</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: The denial. The cover-up. The silence. It starts with
the bishops and goes all the way to Rome. Now they're laying the
whole thing off on priests. How about zero tolerance for cardinals?</TE>
<TE>   Priest: Good point.</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: In the public eye, we're in the gutter. Right down
there with used-car dealers and journalists.</TE>
<TE>   Priest: No, please. Journalists?</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: Well, maybe it's not that bad. But people think we're a
bunch of perverts. I wouldn't be surprised if the San Diego Padres
change their name.</TE>
<TE>   Priest: Some of the cardinals do seem to have a talent for
covering their ....</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: If that were an athletic event, Mahony would be in the
Olympics. I can't afford to fix the roof over the parish school, and
His Eminence is spending a fortune on spin.</TE>
<TE>   Priest: What's the name of the PR firm he hired?</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: That's another thing. What kind of genius hires flacks
who work for nobody but bums and miscreants? Those jackals have taken
on everyone but Enron and Charles Manson.</TE>
<TE>   Priest: Maybe the cardinal is trying to tidy things up a bit
before the new cathedral opens.</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: Don't get me started on the Rog Mahal.</TE>
<TE>   Priest: Look, not to change the subject, but ....</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: I'm sorry. What did you say your sins were?</TE>
<TE>   Priest: The altar boy, Monsignor.</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: Happened only once?</TE>
<TE>   Priest: I swear it.</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: Are you a pedophile?</TE>
<TE>   Priest: No. Touched him once, never again.</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: Are you straight?</TE>
<TE>   Priest: I got into the priesthood very early. That's part of my
problem, Monsignor. I don't know what I am.</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: How old are you, son?</TE>
<TE>   Priest: I'm 27.</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: Ahhh, such a young pup. This is a grave sin, as you
know.</TE>
<TE>   Priest: Yes, Monsignor.</TE>
<TE>   Monsignor: Well, then, for your penance, say 10 Our Fathers and
five Hail Marys. And, uh, you free for lunch?</TE>

<HD>Police Searchers in Disbelief After Overlooking Boy's Body</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after a boy was found at the bottom of a swimming pool where he
lay unseen for nearly 48 hours, the reaction from officers who had
frantically searched for him could be summed up by one word:
disbelief.</LD>
<LD>   "They are saying, 'What? . . . I saw the bottom of that pool!' "
said Capt. Debra McCarthy of the West Los Angeles station. "In their
minds, they knew what they saw."</LD>
<LD>   Some officers still don't believe the official explanation: that a
layer of cloudy, milky water obscured the body, which was found early
Tuesday, ending a search in the Holmby Hills neighborhood where
7-year-old Paolo Ayala had attended a birthday party. Officers were
searching the Internet, or calling pool maintenance companies, trying
to find explanations, McCarthy said.</LD>
<TE>   Commanders were trying out unfamiliar terms such as "suspended
particulates" and "turbidity" as they tried to explain what
happened--not only to the public, but to themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it baffling," said Capt. Richard Wemmer. "It's just
utterly amazing.... The consensus is that everyone thought they were
looking at the bottom."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a bitter pill," McCarthy said. "We feel terrible. We accept
responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Despite a coroner's report that concluded that the body had not
been moved, officers kept walking to the pool, shaking their heads,
still not understanding how what looked like a white pool bottom
really was not, McCarthy said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Thursday that all protocols were followed in the
search for the boy, which began late Sunday afternoon when he was
discovered missing. Police asserted that there is no reason to think
officers were sloppy or cursory in their investigation.</TE>
<TE>   They said officers did what they were supposed to--that is, they
did not simply take witnesses' words at face value, but went to look
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The pool "was a No. 1 concern," Wemmer said. "When they found out
there was a pool, they immediately went to check it."</TE>
<TE>   Many officers later returned to the pool, he said. One skeptical
lieutenant even went back three separate times to make sure, Wemmer
said. But police also acknowledged that only in hindsight does it
seem clear that the pool warranted extra scrutiny. They describe an
investigation that quickly moved in other directions, away from the
scenario of a possible drowning.</TE>
<TE>   Certain that they were seeing the bottom of a whitish pool, where
the body of a dark-haired, olive-skinned boy would have been clearly
visible, detectives spent two nights and a full day in pursuit of
other leads.</TE>
<TE>   Was the boy hiding in the house? Had he run away, perhaps fearing
discipline? Had he been kidnapped?</TE>
<TE>   When first notified of the search at home Sunday evening, for
example, Wemmer could not recall if the pool even came up. Arriving
on the scene the next morning, he acknowledged that "the pool was not
front and center."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, McCarthy, who arrived early Monday, also quickly moved
on from the pool. She looked into the pool from the side and from a
deck above, and, secure in the knowledge that she had seen the
bottom, concentrated on other possible scenarios to explain the
disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   She and other police officials describe being preoccupied with
other tasks: identifying registered sex offenders in the
neighborhood, calling in bloodhounds, appealing to the public for
leads.</TE>
<TE>   And in a point that was to later prove critical, McCarthy said
that no one seems to remember seeing a drain at the bottom of the
pool, or any other object to mar what appeared to be a smooth,
light-colored surface.</TE>
<TE>   After a pool maintenance man put chemicals into the pool and the
body was subsequently discovered, it became clear that the bottom was
not, as it had first appeared, smooth and white.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it was slightly bluish in color and a little
battered-looking, McCarthy said. A drain and a pair of goggles left
on the bottom in the deep end had come into view. They appeared as
through a mist, McCarthy said. Seeing them, she realized that the
water was indeed slightly cloudy.</TE>
<TE>   Recalling the scene in hindsight, McCarthy remembers thinking she
thought the deepest part of the pool was about 6 feet. The pool is 9
feet deep.</TE>
<TE>   From now on, she said, "the rule will be, if you can't see a
drain, you can't see the bottom."</TE>
<TE>   Police said that a white, chalky silt had rendered the water milky
enough to obscure the deeper reaches of the pool, settling in a layer
that looked like the bottom.</TE>
<TE>   Paolo was found under a ladder near the wall of the pool in the
deep end, lying on a slope, 80 inches down.</TE>
<TE>   James Ribe, of the coroner's office, said white silt was found on
the boy's hands and knees.</TE>
<TE>   Cmdr. Gary Brennan said the search will be reviewed to "determine
if we can learn anything. Do we need to look at our investigative
protocols? Do we need to create other protocols?"</TE>
<TE>   The parents of the boy said Thursday they will file a lawsuit
against the party's hosts but not the police.</TE>
<TE>   The Ayalas spoke to reporters at their Beverly Hills apartment,
thanking those who helped search for their son.</TE>
<TE>   Wemmer was contrite.</TE>
<TE>   "I am so sorry the family had to suffer as long as they did."</TE>

<HD>Ojai Traffic Initiative OKd by Judge</HD>
<DH>Courts: Measure that allows residents to decide on
developments that create congestion should be on fall ballot, he
rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A controversial traffic initiative should appear on Ojai's ballot in
November, a judge ruled Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Henry J. Walsh wrote that a proposition
should be kept from the ballot "only where the court has 'grave'
doubts as to its validity." That wasn't the case with the traffic
initiative, he said.</LD>
<LD>   The initiative, if approved, would give voters--rather than the
City Council--the right to approve or reject development projects
that would create more traffic.</LD>
<TE>   Attorneys for the city argued that the measure is confusing, would
mislead voters and would tie the city's hands in its ability to
provide housing for all segments of the population.</TE>
<TE>   "It would act as a moratorium on affordable housing," said
Katherine Stone, an attorney representing the city of Ojai. "It is
very discriminatory."</TE>
<TE>   Walsh said in his ruling that the ballot measure "adequately
informs the electorate."</TE>
<TE>   He also pointed out that it is typically the judiciary's job to
examine a ballot measure after an election, rather than try to
prevent it from going on the ballot in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   "The decision really follows along the lines of what we argued in
court," said Kate Neiswender, who represents Citizens to Preserve the
Ojai, the organization that qualified the measure for the ballot.
"The law is really clear--unless you show [a measure] to be patently
wrong, it must go before the voters."</TE>
<TE>   Neiswender also characterized the city's claims that the measure
would make it impossible to build affordable housing as outrageous.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative "says one thing--if you have a new project, make
sure you mitigate for traffic," Neiswender said.</TE>
<TE>   The growth issue is not new to Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   Census data show that the city, which has a population of 7,862,
grew by only 3% between 1990 and 2000. Neighboring communities with
cheaper real estate grew by 13% to 16%.</TE>
<TE>   Only three new housing projects, totaling 68 units, have been
approved by the city since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Stone said that although she was disappointed by the ruling, it
leaves open the possibility of a post-election challenge. She added
that the City Council has not yet decided whether it will appeal the
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides have said that they expect the fight to continue if the
measure is adopted by voters in November.</TE>
<TE>   "If we win, I suspect we'll be back in court," Neiswender said.</TE>
<TE>   Stone hopes it won't get that far.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a poor measure," she said. "Voters in other jurisdictions
have rejected it, and if it remains on the ballot, I hope that the
voters here reject it."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Stone said, the city is fighting two lawsuits by
Citizens to Preserve the Ojai regarding a downtown development and
the city's housing guidelines. Those cases are scheduled to be heard
on July 1.</TE>

<HD>Sheriff's Chance to Gloat Takes Refreshing Turn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>We've seen that troubled face before. It's the face of someone
outside the boundaries of normal American life, watching from the
sidelines as everyone else plays a game that the person doesn't fully
understand but desperately wants to.</LD>
<LD>   This time, the face belongs to Lori Elizabeth Fischer, whose
booking photo Orange County Sheriff's Department authorities
displayed this week on a large poster to announce her arrest for
allegedly leaving razor blades and other sharp objects at various
South County parks.</LD>
<LD>   It was hard to look at her forlorn face and not form a connection
between her and Andrea Yates, the Houston mother convicted this year
of drowning her five children. Luckily, no children have been
reported injured by the dangerous objects found in the parks, and
that is one of the elements that will make Fischer's case an
interesting one to follow.</LD>
<TE>   In other words, whoever left the razor blades chose not a direct
attack on children but one that was a step removed. Authorities
believe it was Fischer who planted the razor blades, nails and other
objects in sandboxes, under swings and at the bottom of slides. In
addition to finding nails in her vehicle after they stopped her near
a park, they recovered journals with entries that alluded to the
ongoing episodes at the parks. They also believe she was the
anonymous caller who on various occasions telephoned them with
warnings that objects would be planted at specific parks.</TE>
<TE>   In the current lexicon, Fischer's alleged actions amount to
terrorist acts against children.</TE>
<TE>   But even as authorities released some details of their
investigation, the county's top law-enforcement official sent the
discussion down an enlightened path--namely, the mental health of
someone who would do such things.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be a cry for help," said Sheriff Mike Carona of Fischer's
alleged actions.</TE>
<TE>   That's unusual talk from a law-enforcement official, especially
when not a lot is known yet about Fischer's mental health. Unusual
and refreshing.</TE>
<TE>   There is a context here, and authorities were quite willing to
release some of the writings from journals they found in Fischer's
car and home. One of them included the lines "Nails, razorblades,
broken glass/The innocence is shattered/Yellow police tape
encircles/The once peaceful haven."</TE>
<TE>   We've all heard cops scoff at the emotional sensitivity and pain
implicit in such writings. While not minimizing the alleged crimes,
Carona chose to take a broader view.</TE>
<TE>   I asked his spokesman, Jim Amormino, about that Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike Carona is a very sincere, compassionate man," Amormino said.
"He is speaking from the heart. I think he was speaking out of
compassion. Our job is to enforce laws, but I think this shows
there's a human side of a law-enforcement officer, and the statement
by the sheriff emphasizes that."</TE>
<TE>   Amormino said he didn't think Carona's statement would irk the
Orange County district attorney's office, which will prosecute
Fischer if she is formally charged.</TE>
<TE>   "He's speaking from compassion and not [as an expert in mental
health]," Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   It's much too early to weigh in on Fischer's state of mind and
what the proper punishment should be, if she were to be tried and
convicted.</TE>
<TE>   I'm merely applauding Carona for not grandstanding in a case where
good detective work gave him the opening to do just that. Instead,
the sheriff has done a far better thing by widening the lens as the
case now will unfold in the weeks ahead.</TE>
<TE>   That said, Amormino seemed intent on leaving me with an
accompanying view of the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "It does show to us, she did have specific intent to hurt
someone," he said. "The only thing that prevented it was the huge
public awareness program.... I lived this case for a month. I went on
every single call. The razors were placed in upright positions,
strategically placed under slides and swings, in many incidents
buried and not visible to the naked eye. I don't want to get into the
mental-health issue, but these were deliberately set with the
intention to hurt someone, as opposed to getting attention."</TE>
<TE>   Fair enough, but perhaps with his boss' remarks of a day earlier
still fresh in his mind, Amormino quickly added: "But, personally, I
do feel sorry for her, quite honestly."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Priest's Yard Dug Up for Clues in Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY and JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>TRUCKEE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Investigators dug up the yard of a former priest's vacation home
Thursday, searching for clues in the 1988 disappearance of a
7-year-old girl. By late afternoon, however, they had found no
evidence and called off the effort for now.</LD>
<LD>   Using backhoes and shovels, teams of forensics experts sifted
through dirt around an upscale home belonging to 55-year-old Stephen
Kiesle, who is being questioned about Amber Swartz-Garcia, who
disappeared while skipping rope outside her East Bay Area home.</LD>
<LD>   Kiesle was arrested in May on three counts of child molestation,
and police on Tuesday obtained a warrant to dig in the yard of his
1,600-square-foot second home after getting several "hits" there from
cadaver-sniffing dogs.</LD>
<TE>   Truckee Police Cmdr. Scott Berry called the effort "a shot in the
dark." He said investigators had dug holes up to 4 feet deep in three
locations throughout the wooded backyard and moved on to two
additional sites in a 15-by-8-foot area of the frontyard.</TE>
<TE>   When asked why any suspect would bury a body there, he responded:
"When you're dealing with people such as this, they're not rational."</TE>
<TE>   Police did not rule out returning to this small Sierra town of
13,000 near the Nevada state line to excavate the concrete floor of
Kiesle's detached garage. They might opt to use sonar equipment to
plumb beneath the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators in the San Francisco suburb of Pinole were led to
Kiesle after three women came forward to accuse the former priest of
molesting them 30 years ago while he was assigned to the Santa Paula
church in Pinole in the late 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Kiesle lived 14 houses away from Swartz-Garcia, who they say was
the same age and looked similar to the women who have spoken out. The
ex-priest was released on $180,000 bond and is due back in court next
Friday for a bail hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Truckee police are investigating an additional allegation that
Kiesle molested three girls, ages 8 to 9, on a family outing at the
Tahoe Donner Golf Course. Police believe one of the alleged victims
may be a distant relative of Kiesle.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Gagen, Kiesle's attorney, believes police violated his
client's privacy without evidence and says his only connection to
Amber Swartz-Garcia is having once lived "in the same city."</TE>
<TE>   Amid accusations against Catholic priests nationwide, Kiesle makes
an easy target, his lawyer said. "This case has developed a life of
its own, solely through implication," Gagen said. Although Kiesle has
a record of misdemeanor molestation, "he has no record of any
violence," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gagen said the scents recognized by police dogs were "probably
dead rodents."</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about the mountains here," he said. He added that
he has given the consent for police to remove the garage floor of
Kiesle's home if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Kiesle remained in the Pinole home where he has lived
for 20 years, refusing to offer comment to an army of news crews
outside his door. Said Gagen: "He and his wife are just seeking
peace."</TE>
<TE>   Kim Swartz, who heads a missing-children foundation named after
her daughter, did not visit the search site Thursday and said she
does not consider Kiesle to be a suspect. "You don't know until you
check it out," she said. "But I'm not surprised they haven't found
anything."</TE>
<TE>   For 14 years, Swartz has used the image of her daughter as the
little blond girl with purple pants and sneakers, jumping rope in the
family frontyard, to draw help in searching for other missing
children. She has successfully campaigned for a new state law to
create a DNA database specifically to solve missing persons cases.</TE>
<TE>   As police dug in the Sierra 100 miles away looking for the remains
of her daughter, Swartz tried to keep her emotions in check.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to stay even-keeled about these things," she said. "If
you get excited, you fall real low and you don't want to get out of
bed and talk to anyone."</TE>
<TE>   One woman who came forward told police she was molested in Pinole,
where Kiesle worked at St. Joseph's Church from 1972 to 1976 and
again in 1985. Before that, he worked at the now-closed Santa Paula
Catholic Church in Fremont from 1968 to 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Gagen said Kiesle voluntarily resigned from the priesthood in
1981. He married the next year and worked for Chevron, from which he
recently retired after 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Kiesle pleaded no contest in 1978 to lewd conduct for tying up and
sexually molesting two boys, 11 and 12 years old, in the rectory of
Our Lady of the Rosary Church in Union City. He was sentenced to
three years' probation, and left the ministry. Because it was a
misdemeanor conviction, the case was later expunged from Kiesle's
record and he was not questioned when Swartz-Garcia disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Swartz said Thursday that she remembers Kiesle only "as a man who
lived in the neighborhood," but said that his criminal record should
be investigated.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to look at the fact that at the point of my daughter's
disappearance, he was a registered sex offender who ended up getting
his slate wiped clean," she said. "That information wasn't made privy
to Pinole police when Amber went missing. Had police known, he would
have been a top priority."</TE>
<TE>   Residents in Kiesle's Truckee neighborhood, which features homes
ranging from $400,000 to $1 million nestled near the Tahoe Donner
golf course, said they rarely saw the ex-priest.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, teams from the FBI and several California police
departments set up a command post in the garage of Kiesle's
blue-roofed home. Outside, investigators slowly sifted dirt onto
tarps and searched for bone fragments.</TE>
<TE>   In the late afternoon, officers brought in a search dog. All they
found was an old rifle shell casing, which they did not characterize
as evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "At this time we have no evidence of a connection" between Kiesle
and Swartz-Garcia's disappearance, said Berry.</TE>
<TE>   Swartz said that police dogs years ago picked up the scent of her
daughter in the van of a Bay Area man who was then a suspect in
several disappearances. But no case was ever made.</TE>
<TE>   "Bloodhounds can't testify in court," she said. "The findings were
a tool for police. But they couldn't make the case stick."</TE>
<TE>   Watching police dig through the dirt, software engineer Chuck
Anderson called the scene "surreal."</TE>
<TE>   "I just feel for the family," said Anderson, who has two
daughters, "and hope they get some closure."</TE>

Francisco. Times staff researcher Norma Kaufman contributed to this

<HD>Bodies ID'd as Shooter's Parents'</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police say corpses are kin of man whom officers
killed amid Long Beach market rampage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bodies found in the condo of the man who went on a murderous
rampage in a Long Beach supermarket were those of his parents, whom
he killed with a hammer more than two years ago, Long Beach police
now say.</LD>
<LD>   Antonio Pineiro, who was schizophrenic, sprinkled a white powdery
substance--thought to be a drying agent--on the corpses after the
couple were bludgeoned to death sometime around Mother's Day 2000,
homicide Lt. Bill Blair said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The powder has yet to be identified but the bodies, found in bed,
were in advance stages of "mummification," Blair said. It was
originally thought the bodies had been on the bed about a year.</LD>
<TE>   Police also found several Polaroid photographs Pineiro took of the
decomposed bodies that he dated "April 2001"--more than a year after
their presumed deaths.</TE>
<TE>   "The word 'macabre' doesn't do it justice," Blair said.</TE>
<TE>   These and other details were released Thursday as police continued
to investigate the May 30 shooting at Top Valu Market that left a
checker and a girl, 8, dead. Pineiro wounded four others, including
the girl's parents, before an officer fatally shot him.</TE>
<TE>   Although it may never be known what triggered Pineiro's slaying of
his parents and the market rampage, police said one event may have
sparked last week's event. On April 22, the condo building's
property-management firm notified tenants that it would be fumigating
the building in early June, and inspections would be conducted to
ensure that all occupants were out of the building.</TE>
<TE>   Pineiro, 48, was born in Cuba and had been a dentist there before
he immigrated to the United States with his mother, Maria Llufrio,
69, and stepfather, Antonio Oscar Llufrio, 68, in 1981. Pineiro was
unable to pass the dental-accreditation exam that would have allowed
him to practice in the United States, police said. They have found no
job history but determined that Pineiro had received disability
payments for mental illness from 1985 through 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Property records show that he purchased the tiny two-bedroom condo
in a 1950s-era Cedar Avenue building, which backs up to the market,
in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Pineiro's parents received Social Security benefits until March
2001, when they were cut off because they failed to appear at the
department for an interview. Blair said it was not clear if Pineiro
had been cashing their checks after their deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Focused on Mail, Market</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said Pineiro appeared to have no job or place to be; his
daily routine was to check his mailbox, go to the market and not much
else.</TE>
<TE>   He was often seen lugging large quantities of groceries and three
boxes of laundry detergent at a time up to his second-floor unit. He
declined any request to help him haul the loads. In contrast, his
parents were described as warm and friendly.</TE>
<TE>   It was initially reported that there had been no complaints of
unsavory events or smells emanating from the condo.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the city said the nuisance-abatement department
visited the building at least twice on complaints of a foul odor,
however, but could not locate its source.</TE>
<TE>   Pineiro, though, made four complaints of his own. Police said that
over four years he said he was a victim of a garage burglary, petty
theft and malicious mischief.</TE>
<TE>   Blair said some of those reports predated the presumed deaths of
his parents, but some occurred after the killings.</TE>
<TE>   He had no exact dates or details on whether officers visited
Pineiro's condo.</TE>
<TE>   Though his and other rooms were meticulously clean, his parents'
bedroom, which overlooks the Top Valu parking lot, contained a
blood-speckled hammer and the powdery substance around the room,
Blair said.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives also found a journal of rambling, nonsensical thoughts
and musings by Pineiro, which indicated that he planned the
grocery-store shooting and intended to kill people, according to
Blair. Handwritten and typewritten notes stated: "The last day before
the shooting, May 2002" and "The day of the shooting May 30, 2002,
Top Valu."</TE>
<TE>   Wrote About Santeria</TE>
<TE>   Pineiro's writing also contained references to Santeria, a
religion that blends Catholicism with West African culture and
beliefs, Blair said.</TE>
<TE>   There was no sign that his parents' deaths were related to
religion, only indications that he held many Santeria beliefs,
including a heavy emphasis on a world of spirits, the lieutenant
said.</TE>
<TE>   Blair said the scrawled writings revealed mental illness, but also
a clear intent.</TE>
<TE>   He said he suspects Pineiro realized that after two years, his
crime would finally be discovered.</TE>
<TE>   "He knew the day that he left his apartment," Blair said, "that he
was going to go down to the market to shoot people."</TE>

<HD>Judge Orders Ryder Tried on Charges of Shoplifting</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Saks employee testifies that she saw the actress
cut security tags from two purses. Defense accuses witnesses of lying
on the stand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Winona Ryder was ordered Thursday to stand trial on shoplifting
charges after a court hearing in which a Saks Fifth Avenue security
investigator testified that she saw the actress snip anti-theft tags
off two expensive black purses that she never paid for.</LD>
<LD>   Beverly Hills Superior Court Judge Elden S. Fox ruled that there
was enough evidence for Ryder to be tried on felony charges of
second-degree burglary, grand theft, vandalism and possession of a
drug without a prescription.</LD>
<LD>   Fox denied a defense motion to reduce the charges to misdemeanors
and ordered Ryder, who is free on $20,000 bail, to return to court
June 14 for arraignment.</LD>
<TE>   Ryder, 30, appeared for the second day of her preliminary hearing
with a blue sling on her bandaged right arm, which her attorney said
was fractured Monday when a TV news camera struck her as she tried to
enter the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   The injury prompted the judge to call a two-day break in the
proceedings and to order the media to stay 10 feet from Ryder.</TE>
<TE>   She has maintained her innocence through her attorney, Mark
Geragos, who said Thursday outside court, "She didn't steal any of
these items."</TE>
<TE>   The star of "Girl, Interrupted" and "The Age of Innocence" is
charged with shoplifting $4,760 worth of merchandise Dec. 12. In all,
20 items allegedly were shoplifted, including two hats, two beaded
evening bags, an off-white sweater and a sleeveless shirt, according
to court testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder could face three years and eight months in prison if
convicted.</TE>
<TE>   During Thursday's session, the security investigator, Colleen
Rainey, testified that she first saw a disheveled woman on a security
camera who she believed was homeless and then realized was Ryder.</TE>
<TE>   Rainey was told by her manager to go to a second-floor fitting
room to watch the customer more closely.</TE>
<TE>   Rainey said that when she peeked through slats of the dressing
room, she saw Ryder kneeling and cutting off the antitheft tags.</TE>
<TE>   The actress cut her finger in the process, Rainey said, leaving a
bloodstain on a purse that she left in the dressing room.</TE>
<TE>   Rainey said Ryder then wrapped two purses, three hair bands and
several pairs of socks in tissue paper and stuffed them in a bag.
Those items, according to testimony from Rainey and Saks security
manager Kenneth Evans, were never paid for.</TE>
<TE>   On cross-examination, Rainey said she did not videotape or
photograph Ryder's actions.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos questioned the agent's truthfulness, suggesting that a
garment bag might have blocked her view during the few minutes she
was peeking through the door.</TE>
<TE>   "So you have the ability to see through slats and around corners?"
he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Evans testified that he watched Ryder for an hour and 20 minutes
on a store security camera. She was wearing a long cashmere coat and
carrying a red Saks bag, a garment bag, a purse and a plastic bag, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Evans said he never saw Ryder stop to pay for any items before
leaving the store.</TE>
<TE>   He also testified that he recovered four sensor tags--some with
material still attached to them--from a coat pocket in the Chanel
boutique in the department store.</TE>
<TE>   Under cross-examination, Evans acknowledged that he learned that
Ryder did pay for $3,700 worth of merchandise from Saks that day,
including $300 Gucci shoes, a leather jacket and two Yves St. Laurent
blouses.</TE>
<TE>   The other items seized from Ryder were not listed on receipts, he
testified.</TE>
<TE>   Two law enforcement witnesses also were questioned.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills Police Det. Mark Parker said Thursday that he booked
a yellow pillbox and two white pills taken from Ryder into the jail's
evidence locker Dec. 12.</TE>
<TE>   Those pills contained oxycodone, according to Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department criminalist Tracy Arnold.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold said the pills were a generic brand of Percoset, a
painkiller.</TE>
<TE>   Outside court, Geragos said Ryder had a prescription for the
painkiller. He also accused the Saks witnesses of lying on the stand.</TE>
<TE>   "That testimony was as close to full-blown perjury as I've ever
seen in a courtroom," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And he blamed the department store and the district attorney's
office for going after Ryder. "I have evidence that Saks targeted her
as a celebrity ... they found a more-than-willing partner in a
district attorney," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Julie Jurek countered that the case against
Ryder is strong and the witnesses truthful.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have an ax to grind," she said.</TE>

<HD>Prosecutors' Puzzle: When to Try, Try Again</HD>
<DH>Gravity of the offense is one factor when D.A.s seek repeat
trials after juries deadlock. But persisting can raise ethics issues,
some say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first time Carlos Burns was tried for attempted murder, the case
ended in a mistrial when a sole juror held out for acquittal.</LD>
<LD>   So prosecutors retried Burns, who is now 21, for allegedly
shooting a man in the leg. This time, the majority voted not
guilty--8 to 4--and another mistrial was declared.</LD>
<LD>   Legal experts say it is usually more difficult to win a conviction
with each successive trial. But Los Angeles County prosecutors
nonetheless decided to try the street gang member a third time. The
jurors were again split, 6 to 6, when the judge declared a mistrial
because of evidence issues.</LD>
<TE>   At that point, Burns' lawyer declared that enough was enough. "If
their case was so good, they should have won it the first time,"
defense attorney Juanita McLean told the judge.</TE>
<TE>   But since a unanimous verdict had not yet been reached, double
jeopardy protection did not apply. And prosecutors, confident that
Burns was guilty, decided to try him yet again.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth time was the charm. Burns was convicted of attempted
murder and is due to be sentenced to up to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The Burns case illustrates the tug-of-war between prosecutors who
are determined to win a conviction against people they believe are
guilty and defense attorneys who believe their clients should not be
tried over and over.</TE>
<TE>   Trying 1 Defendant 4 Times Is Rare</TE>
<TE>   Although prosecutors routinely try cases twice, and occasionally
even three times, when jurors deadlock, it is rare to try a defendant
four times. And it is even rarer for prosecutors to be so persistent
in a case that does not involve a murder, lawyers and judges said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's unusual, but certainly not unprecedented," said
Supervising Criminal Judge Dan Oki, though he could not comment
specifically on the Burns case.</TE>
<TE>   In deciding whether to allow a fourth--or even fifth--trial to
move forward, Oki said, judges consider several factors, including
the seriousness of the crime, whether prosecutors have additional
evidence and the cost of trying a particular case. It runs more than
$9,000 a day to operate a courtroom, said Kyle Christopherson, a
spokesman for the Los Angeles County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   With every trial, the likelihood of winning a conviction
diminishes, because witnesses are no longer available or their
recollections dim, attorneys said. In addition, at that point,
defense attorneys have had several dress rehearsals and may know the
best ways to attack the prosecution's case.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, prosecutors usually decide to offer a plea bargain,
because they don't believe they will get a jury to reach a guilty
verdict in another trial, said Peter Keane, dean of Golden Gate
University Law School.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is no law preventing repeat prosecutions, Keane
said trying someone more than two or three times raises ethical
questions. Prosecutors have a duty only to try cases if they firmly
believe they can convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that the
defendant is guilty, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "After three trials, it is very difficult for a prosecutor to
ethically justify another prosecution," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Keane said he represented a defendant in a capital murder case in
which jurors deadlocked twice. Instead of trying the case a third
time, prosecutors allowed his client to plead guilty to a lesser
charge of manslaughter, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Diane L. Karpman, an attorney who specializes in legal ethics,
agreed that devoting public resources to trying someone over and over
"is very questionable." In such cases, attorneys may have become
overly zealous.</TE>
<TE>   "That many times, you wonder if the lawyer has crossed over and
gotten too emotional," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Type of Crime Is Key, Says Former D.A.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Karpman said, prosecutors should not give up on
cases if the alleged crime is egregious.</TE>
<TE>   Former Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Robert Philibosian says
prosecutors have to carefully consider the type of crime when
deciding whether to go forward. "Attempted murder is still a very
serious crime," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Jose Arias succinctly explained his reason for
trying the Burns case a fourth time: "I believe to the best of my
ability that he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt."</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 1, 1999, two men were walking on 53rd Street just east of
Normandie Avenue in South-Central Los Angeles. A red car drove by,
made a U-turn and backed into an alley. The passenger of the car
fired at the two men, missing one and hitting the other in the knee,
according to police.</TE>
<TE>   The driver, Omar Camacho, was arrested that night after a car
pursuit by LAPD officers. Camacho told police that the shooter, who
fled on foot, was a Rolling 40s gang member named Carlos. Police made
wanted signs with Burns' picture on them, leading to his arrest two
months later.</TE>
<TE>   Camacho and Burns were each charged with one count of conspiracy
to commit murder and two counts of attempted murder, along with a
special allegation that the crime was committed to benefit a street
gang.</TE>
<TE>   In the first trial, which began in March 2001, Camacho took the
stand in his own defense, telling jurors that Burns threatened him
and forced him to drive. The jury acquitted Camacho on all counts and
found Burns not guilty of conspiracy. They deadlocked on the
attempted murder charges against Burns, with all but one juror voting
for guilt. The judge declared a mistrial.</TE>
<TE>   In the second trial, which began that November, Camacho again took
the stand and testified against Burns. The jury deadlocked again.</TE>
<TE>   The third trial took place in March 2002. Camacho did not testify,
but both attorneys referred to him in front of jurors. McLean told
jurors in her opening statement that Camacho was not able to identify
Burns as the passenger. Arias told jurors in his closing argument
that Camacho gave police information that pinpointed Burns.</TE>
<TE>   The jurors began deliberating and sent two notes to the judge. The
first said they were divided: six votes for guilty and six for not
guilty. The second stated that they needed clarification about the
references to Camacho.</TE>
<TE>   After reading the notes, Judge Robert J. Perry declared a third
mistrial because he believed that the emphasis on Camacho's
statements outside of court confused the jury.</TE>
<TE>   McLean then asked the judge to dismiss the case, arguing that her
client's protection against double jeopardy would be violated if he
were tried again. Prosecutors said they wanted to try him a fourth
time. Judge Perry denied the defense motion.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth trial, Burns was finally convicted of attempted
murder.</TE>
<TE>   His mother said the prosecutors wanted a conviction, no matter
what. "I don't understand it," said Mary Burns, a fleet service clerk
for American Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   But she said she too refuses to give up, and will urge his lawyer
to appeal. Or demand yet another trial.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll fight for him any way I can," she said.</TE>

<DH>Firefighting: The Wolf blaze in Los Padres wilderness
spreads to 20,000 acres. Sensitive species and Indian rock art are
now threatened.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Firefighters continued their assault Thursday on a fast-moving
wildfire that has scorched nearly 20,000 acres in the Los Padres
National Forest north of Ojai and is now threatening ancient Native
American ruins and the habitat of three endangered animals.</LD>
<LD>   A huge wall of flames--four football fields wide and 100-feet high
in some areas--showed no signs of slowing after a furious run east
across hillsides and valleys in the Sespe Wilderness the night
before. Fanned by 10 to 20 mph winds, the wildfire moved quicker
Wednesday evening than at any time in the previous four nights,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "It's really grown today because we got some wind," said Rich
Phelps, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service. "The humidity was in
the low teens and it was warm at 11 p.m. There were [firefighters]
out there at night. It's a risky business."</LD>
<TE>   Warm steady breezes, stifling 100-degree temperatures and
thousands of acres of brush and trees have combined to fuel the fire,
which some officials predict could consume more than 30,000 acres
before it's knocked down.</TE>
<TE>   With more than 1,700 firefighters battling the blaze, the six-day
fire has so far cost state and county agencies in excess of $4
million. The fire remains only 15% contained. While the blaze is not
yet a threat to nearby communities, officials want to err on the side
of caution and also protect watersheds and other resources within the
wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   In northern Los Angeles County, a wind-whipped brush fire also
continued to burn out of control, scorching more than 15,600 acres,
prompting officials to evacuate 1,100 residents from their houses and
ranches in Green Valley, north of Saugus.</TE>
<TE>   Seven houses were destroyed by the fire, which burned through a
home a few hours after the blaze started about 2:30 p.m. Wednesday.
No serious injuries have been reported. The cause of the fire has not
been determined but is of a "suspicious origin," fire officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The fire began on Copper Hill in San Francisquito Canyon and
picked up momentum as it consumed thick brush in the Angeles National
Forest. By nightfall Thursday, the fire was 5% contained.</TE>
<TE>   "It's horrible, ashes falling everywhere, the sun was blood-red
and the house was pitch black," said Steve Jolliffe, 33, a Green
Valley homeowner who with his wife, Sonya, was evacuated to Saugus
High School. "The houses are empty up there. It was eerie."</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, the so-called Wolf fire sped east over six
miles of peaks and valleys near Pine Mountain Ridge overnight and
continued to burn in dozens of hot spots throughout the Sespe
Wilderness on Thursday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Hand crews, armed with pick axes and shovels, hiked into the
rugged back country after bulldozers plowed through a line of thick,
brush-covered trails. They were followed by a group of U.S. Forest
Service biologists and archeologists on hand to ensure that the
tractors didn't destroy Indian ruins or sensitive habitat.</TE>
<TE>   Among the potential casualties of the wildfire are ancient
artifacts left behind by Chumash Indians, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   There are more than 200 rock art drawings in the path of the fire
that were made by Native Americans more than 5,000 years ago, said
Joan Brandoff-Kerr, an archeologist with the Los Padres National
Forest. She said an untold number of ancient woven baskets, tools,
clothing and other artifacts could also be destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   "The rock art here is internationally know for its quality," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials fear that the rock art could be blackened or damaged by
the fire or the retardant dropped by aircraft to squash the flames.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, U.S. Forest Service biologists have grown increasingly
nervous about the fire's effect on the arroyo toad and the southern
steelhead trout. The fire is already believed to have burned some
habitat for both species.</TE>
<TE>   The toad lives near moist creek beds. The steelhead trout is one
of few fish species in Southern California that migrate from the
ocean to freshwater creeks.</TE>
<TE>   "The toads have not been impacted," said Al Hess, a resource
officer with the U.S. Forest Service. "But we don't want them to get
run over by a bulldozer."</TE>
<TE>   By afternoon Thursday, the fire had moved within eight miles of
the Sespe Condor Sanctuary, although officials said the rare birds
were not in danger. Firefighters and hand crews worked to cut fire
breaks on the north and south perimeters of the fire to help redirect
the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the wildfire near Saugus, the Wolf fire has threatened few
structures and no homes. As a result, crews are being cautious in how
they attack the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to get someone killed," said Mike Erb, a captain
with the Los Angeles County Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   Erb and a small team of firefighters spent much of the day on a
high ridge overlooking a portion of Sespe Creek--a meandering stream
of trickling water that has become a sort of beachhead for
firefighters intent on stopping or at least slowing the blaze. Beyond
the creek, 7,000-foot peaks that days before were covered with pine
trees and chaparral, had been reduced to smoldering stumps and
charcoal gray mounds.</TE>
<TE>   Down below in the creek, a team of Ventura County firefighters
plowed through an overgrown trail with bulldozers in an effort to
stop the fire from advancing. Bulldozers will also be used to cut
lines 10 miles east at Johnson Ridge.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday afternoon is expected to be a critical day among those
charting the course of the wildfire.</TE>
<TE>   "Our final objective is Johnson Ridge," said Rich Phelps, a
spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service. "There is a low [weather]
trough coming through with lower temperatures and higher humidity. If
the fire gets there on a slow march we will keep it there."</TE>
<TE>   Officials have not determined how the fire started. But sources
close to the investigation and witnesses said people shooting
firearms at an abandoned car Saturday near the Wolf Grill off
California 33 most likely ignited the blaze.</TE>

<HD>Not Oblivious to Oblivion</HD>
<DH>Pakistan and India are aware of the stakes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUMIT GANGULY</AU>
<BD>Sumit Ganguly, a professor of Asian studies and
government at the University of Texas at Austin, is author of
"Conflict Unending: India-Pakistan Tensions Since 1947" (Columbia
University Press and Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like Mark Twain's death, reports of imminent nuclear war in South
Asia have been greatly exaggerated by the news media and policymakers
in the West.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistan's feckless support for insurgents in the
Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir, whose decade-long attacks have
become particularly brazen in the last six months, has driven India
to mobilize nearly 750,000 troops along the border between the two
countries. Pakistan's leaders, in turn, have placed their forces on
high alert and have begun moving troops from the country's western
borders, where they have been engaged in a half-hearted search for Al
Qaeda and Taliban stragglers, to its eastern borders with India.</LD>
<LD>   Political leaders on both sides have exacerbated tensions with
saber-rattling public statements. The doomsday reporting that has
predominated in the American news media and the overblown rhetoric of
U.S. policymakers, however, would have us believe that decision
makers in New Delhi and Islamabad do not understand the strategic
significance or the terrifying properties of nuclear weapons or the
ruinous consequences of even a limited nuclear war.</LD>
<TE>   Rest assured: They do understand. Many are old enough to remember
the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; the rest have studied
military history.</TE>
<TE>   India and Pakistan developed nuclear capabilities to deter nuclear
blackmail and large-scale conventional military attacks. India
acquired nuclear weapons primarily to protect itself from China and
from China's nuclear client, Pakistan. India's overwhelming
superiority in conventional weapons, in turn, especially after its
unequivocal military victory over Pakistan in 1971, drove Pakistani
decision makers to acquire nuclear weapons to deter a possible Indian
attack.</TE>
<TE>   If Indian and Pakistani leaders meant to use their nuclear
weapons, they would have built shelters for their critical decision
makers and formulated elaborate plans for post-attack recovery. There
is no evidence that either side has so prepared. The lack of panic on
the streets and in the government buildings of Islamabad and New
Delhi, cited with such disdain by Western reporters, is a sign not of
naivete but of equanimity.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts in the U.S. have contended that nuclear deterrence
may not hold in South Asia; that in the midst of a crisis fraught
with the prospect of miscalculation, one side might be tempted to
carry out a preemptive strike against the other's nuclear weapons.
This scenario draws too heavily on the superpower context of the Cold
War, when both sides possessed extraordinarily large arsenals and
even developed nuclear war strategies. Fortunately, neither India nor
Pakistan possesses adequate conventional or nuclear capabilities to
carry out a decapitating preemptive strike, nor is either likely to
possess any such assets in the foreseeable future.</TE>
<TE>   Recent media reports also have focused on newly revealed evidence
about Pakistan's movement of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles
during the conflict in the Kargil region of Kashmir in May 1999.
These movements are cited to illustrate how close the two sides came
to a nuclear war three years ago. But more than one inference can be
made from that evidence. Pakistan may have moved those missiles
knowing full well that Indian (and American) intelligence sources
would take note; such movement was an effective reminder to India not
to expand the conflict in Kargil.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the possibility of nuclear war in the region remains
exceedingly small. The energy and rhetoric that the news media and
policymakers are devoting to conjuring doomsday scenarios would be
better spent addressing the root causes of the current crisis:
Pakistani support for terrorism in Kashmir and, underlying it all,
the legitimate grievances of the Kashmiri people.</TE>

<HD>Can Homeland Security Plan Make Us Safe?</HD>
<DH>Reorganization doesn't do enough to keep terrorists from
our shores.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL O'HANLON and PETER ORSZAG</AU>
<BD>Michael O'Hanlon and Peter Orszag are among the
coauthors of "Protecting the American Homeland: A Preliminary
Analysis" (Brookings, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush's proposal to create a Cabinet-level Department of
Homeland Security is a step in the right direction in that it would
improve how the government is organized to prevent terrorism. But
that alone won't do it. The plan doesn't adequately protect our most
vulnerable sites or do enough to keep those who would harm us from
our shores.</LD>
<LD>   Since terrorists will always look for our weakest points, Congress
needs to figure out where the shortcomings in Bush's new proposal may
reside and fix them.</LD>
<LD>   Providing robust homeland security requires multiple levels of
effort, including keeping dangerous people and materials out of the
country and preventing any terrorists who reach U.S. soil from
undertaking attacks by limiting their access to dangerous materials
or by arresting or deporting them before they strike.</LD>
<TE>   It also requires the protection of our most vulnerable sites
against violence. And, if all this fails, reducing the human and
economic consequences of any attacks that occur.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's plan includes good elements, such as its mechanisms for
coordinating intelligence efforts. But it risks repeating some of the
flaws found in his budget proposal for homeland security for 2003,
released four months ago and still under review by Congress: It puts
too little emphasis on protecting vulnerable targets and preventing
terrorists from getting their hands on dangerous materials.</TE>
<TE>   Consider some of the preventive measures that are essential for
improved homeland security that have not yet received high-priority
attention from the administration: ways of preventing biological
agents from being introduced into the air intake systems of major
buildings and other large facilities, higher standards of security
for plants producing toxic chemicals, safeguards on trucks carrying
hazardous materials and background checks on their drivers, and major
improvements and expansions in the Coast Guard and Customs services,
largely for monitoring containers entering the country.</TE>
<TE>   Most of these measures are hard to implement because they require
cooperation between the private sector and the government.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the assets in the U.S. requiring protection or monitoring
are privately owned, yet the government has responsibility for
protecting the country as a whole from attacks that could kill large
numbers or badly damage the economy.</TE>
<TE>   How can this type of cooperation be encouraged and enhanced?</TE>
<TE>   One approach would be for the government to pay for the required
security measures itself, even when they involve private firms. This
would be unreasonably expensive for the federal budget.</TE>
<TE>   Or the government could mandate that private owners take specific
steps to better protect their firms. But that could be overly
burdensome and ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   The most cost-effective approach would probably be a combination
of performance-based regulation with insurance coverage, similar to
the system used for homeownership.</TE>
<TE>   Local building codes specify minimum standards that homes must
meet. That is the regulatory component.</TE>
<TE>   But mortgages also generally require homes to carry insurance, and
insurance companies provide incentives for improvements beyond the
building-code level--for example, by reducing premiums if the
homeowner installs a security system.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, in homeland security, regulations should provide a
backstop of protection, while the insurance market could spread
information about best practices and provide a direct financial
incentive to improving security.</TE>
<TE>   Developing these kinds of measures is a complex task. It is also
at least as important as restructuring Washington's bureaucracies.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge's
office is still working on a strategic plan for protecting the
homeland. That plan is due in July, though reports suggest that its
release will be postponed until the fall.</TE>
<TE>   The bad news is that Bush, by highlighting his reorganization plan
so prominently, could make us focus too much on government charts in
the coming months and not enough on protecting the country.</TE>

<HD>Ebony and Ivory Come Together in Eminem</HD>
<DH>The rapper tells us what it means to be white in this
culture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CRISPIN SARTWELL</AU>
<BD>Crispin Sartwell is the author of "Act Like You Know:
African-American Autobiography and White Identity" (University of
Chicago Press, 1998).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>African American music and its appropriation and commercial
exploitation by white folks is, to a remarkable extent, the history
of world popular music in the 20th and, so far, in the 21st
centuries.</LD>
<LD>   Consider the artists: Benny Goodman, Elvis Presley, the Beatles,
the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, the Eurythmics. And then there are
the mere exploiters: Pat Boone, Vanilla Ice, the Backstreet Boys.</LD>
<LD>   Each moment in the history of pop music has been a moment in the
history of race relations. But white culture has never been as
self-conscious, and white use of black vernacular has never been more
knowing than on "The Eminem Show"--which has dominated the market in
sales since its May 28 release.</LD>
<TE>   Presley never sang about his own status as a white person
performing black music, but Eminem tackles the question at the start
of the new album. On a song called "White America," Eminem attributes
his success to the color of his skin.</TE>
<TE>   This is not entirely fair to himself, because by any measure he is
one of the best rappers of any race that ever grabbed a microphone.
But he's got a point: "See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
who otherwise would of never knew these words exist ... till I
created so much [expletive] turbulence straight out the tube, right
into your living room I came, and kids flipped.... That's all it
took, and they were instantly right in, and they connected with me
too because I looked like them."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the obsession with Eminem, by his own account,
derives in part from the color of his skin, and the controversy that
swirls around him derives in turn from that obsession.</TE>
<TE>   As he says, suburban white kids (he calls them "Eric" and "Erica")
connect with his experience--his alienation.</TE>
<TE>   His excess and his success are inseparable from the color of his
skin.</TE>
<TE>   The mere existence of Eminem, as that of Elvis, constitutes a
self-critique of white America. In Eminem's reading, the pale 'burbs
constitute a regime of sheer appearance, in which the surface is
bland and perfect and the reality is a roiling whirlpool of pain and
disaffection.</TE>
<TE>   Elvis challenged white America to acknowledge its false exclusion
of pleasure: dance and sex.</TE>
<TE>   Eminem challenges us to acknowledge our equally false exclusion of
pain.</TE>
<TE>   Eminem has dedicated himself to embodying the repressed
strangeness of white-bread American life: its addictions, its
obsessions, its violence. Even in the cartoon scenarios that he
constructs, he speaks at the deepest levels of cultural truth. Hence,
he's the overwhelming figure of the moment.</TE>
<TE>   Eminem is our authority on what it means to be white in this
culture, a question that is difficult, central and dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   He gains his authority from his being white on the periphery of
white culture, or being white in black culture. His records are
produced by the great rap impresario Dr. Dre, and they speak from
outside and inside white culture simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   They speak with the authority of identity because Eminem is white.
But they speak at the same time with the authority of distance
because they express white culture in part from a black point of
view.</TE>
<TE>   That's a unique vantage, and Eminem's artistry is to be able to
express it with incomparable clarity and intensity. That's why, like
it or not, he's our Elvis.</TE>

<LD>When I lived in New Orleans, I was told about a trial before one of
our state judges in which a local madam appeared under a charge of
assaulting an officer. The bordello was periodically subject to
routine sweeps by the police to "keep up appearances." The madam,
however, was mistaken on the appointed time and, according to one
arresting officer, slammed a swinging door in his face.</LD>
<LD>   On cross-examination, the madam denied the allegation and insisted
that there was no swinging door in that room. When the prosecutor
expressed skepticism, the madam turned to the judge and said, "Judge,
you know ... there is no swinging door in that parlor."</LD>
<LD>   The story captured the attitude of local authorities toward
bordellos in Louisiana. In New Orleans, houses of ill-repute are some
of the oldest institutions in the French Quarter and are often cited
on tours as virtual cultural landmarks.</LD>
<TE>   Prostitution itself is a misdemeanor, a law universally honored in
the breach. This is a view not shared by Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's
Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the Justice Department announced the results of a long
investigation of a French Quarter bordello that serviced a virtual
who's who of New Orleans elite, including at least one judge.</TE>
<TE>   For more than 13 months, the Justice Department has conducted a
major investigation of this bordello, producing hundreds of pages of
surveillance transcripts and reports by 10 FBI agents. With
considerable fanfare, the Justice Department touted its "catch" in a
news conference: 12 prostitutes.</TE>
<TE>   Only the FBI could go to the French Quarter and find just a dozen
prostitutes after a year of investigation. Given the roughly
one-to-one ratio between agents and prostitutes, the FBI could have
produced a hundred times this number by having agents walk down
Bourbon Street.</TE>
<TE>   In some parts of New Orleans, a "sting operation" for prostitutes
requires the simple opening of a car door.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, when the Justice Department convinced an unwitting
judge to sign this surveillance order, it had promised something far
more alluring. It insisted that the bordello would reveal mob
dealings as well as criminal activities by an infamous gang. It
further assured the judge that the bordello was a hot spot for major
drug transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the surveillance failed to nail a single mobster or
gang member.</TE>
<TE>   As for the drugs, the FBI carefully made a case against a
62-year-old woman who sold small amounts of marijuana for personal
use at the location--often a joint at a time.</TE>
<TE>   When confronted by the ludicrous "haul" of 12 prostitutes, the
Justice Department was unapologetic and insisted that this was a
major law enforcement victory. Federal prosecutor Sal Perricone spoke
for the Justice Department when he pledged more of such enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   'We'll seek it out, we'll find it, we'll grab it by the scruff of
the neck, and we're going to prosecute it," Perricone said.</TE>
<TE>   That is certainly reassuring. While it was revealed this week that
the FBI largely ignored CIA identifications of known terrorists in
the U.S. before Sept. 11, it appears that it was able to find
prostitutes in New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   It simply boggles the mind how such an investigation could have
been approved, let alone continued after the September attacks.</TE>
<TE>   When these agents were carefully recording calls to a bordello,
hundreds of other agents were being shifted from major crimes to
homeland security. While Ashcroft was seeking expanded powers to
listen in on suspected terrorists, these agents were listening to the
descriptions of particular prostitutes and their special
"capabilities."</TE>
<TE>   Agents carefully recorded the strict rates of $200 to $300 an hour
and how the mother-daughter team that ran the bordello could barely
pay their bills on their 50% take. The mother and daughter are now
cooperating in the prosecution of their former "employees."</TE>
<TE>   None of the johns (including the judge, respected lawyers,
stockbrokers, bankers and civic leaders) have been charged.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Justice Department found federal crimes for the
prostitutes, they could not imagine a federal crime for the johns.</TE>
<TE>   Such matters, they explained, are strictly matters for local
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department is half-right. It was all a matter for
local concern.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department insists that it had jurisdiction in this
case because some of the prostitutes crossed state lines. However,
this merely explains that the government could investigate, not that
it should.</TE>
<TE>   Most any crime today has some element that crosses state lines,
but we expect the Justice Department to resist temptation.</TE>
<TE>   One can certainly appreciate that it is more interesting to listen
in on the supplying of sexual services than it is to eavesdrop on
that of banking services. However, the Justice Department is expected
to resist such calls of the erotic.</TE>
<TE>   Like many tourists on Bourbon Street, the Justice Department
simply stayed too long and paid too much in the Big Easy.</TE>

<HD>Wrong Time for New Prison</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Connect the dots. Last week, the Justice Department released a study
showing that the fanatical prison building boom in most U.S. states
in the 1980s and early '90s did not deter crime. In fact, the rate at
which inmates released from prison committed new crimes increased
from 1983 to 1994. The California Department of Corrections has
overspent its budget by $277 million and has a surplus of more than
10,000 costly prison beds since passage of Proposition 36, which
diverts some nonviolent drug offenders to treatment instead of
prison.</LD>
<LD>   Put it all together, and it is obvious that Gov. Gray Davis should
not spend $595 million building a new state prison in the Central
Valley town of Delano. Last month, a state Senate subcommittee
scratching for funds to restore some of the programs axed in the
governor's new austerity budget suggested that construction at Delano
at least be delayed.</LD>
<TE>   None of the state's top legislative leaders, however, has seconded
that recommendation. Legislators are clearly loath to antagonize
Davis on this. The governor has been Delano's most ardent supporter
since 1998, when the state was flush with cash and the California
Correctional Peace Officers Assn. donated $2 million to his campaign.
But in a year when his budget has come up $22 billion short, surely
Davis can recognize that building Delano now would be a boondoggle.
Facing similar fiscal crises, four Republican governors have recently
closed prisons to save money.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the prison building issue, Davis so far has refused to
consider even modest proposals to save money by handling nonviolent
offenders in different ways. Half a dozen states, for example, have
modified their sentencing laws in recent months to increase early
releases and ramp up supervision of newly released inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' new budget pares only $6million from the state's
$4.8-billion prison budget but slashes more than $900 million from
what was originally proposed for education and $200 million from
health and welfare.</TE>
<TE>   Davis had to make some hard choices in fashioning his revised
budget, and in large part he made sensible ones. But he has a blind
spot when it come to prisons and the guards' union. There comes a
time when a responsible governor says "no" to even the most
supportive and generous interest group.</TE>

<LD>It's a sure bet that the next time police officers are called to a
home with a swimming pool because a child has disappeared, they will
dredge the bottom of the pool. But unfortunately, even if Los Angeles
Police Department officers had not conducted such a bush league
investigation, it wouldn't have saved 7-year-old Paolo Ayala.</LD>
<LD>   The boy probably died in an instant, long before police arrived or
before anyone at the pool party to which he was invited noticed. Like
too many kids in too many pools, Paolo probably just slipped quietly
under the water, and away, in full view of adults and children.</LD>
<LD>   Police officers arrived at the Holmby Hills home late Sunday
afternoon after Paolo's parents came to pick up their son after a
classmate's birthday party and discovered he was missing. Officers
peered into the family pool and thought they saw a clear bottom. What
they saw, it turns out, was chalky water that obscured Ayala's body
until Tuesday morning, when a horrified housekeeper spotted it.</LD>
<TE>   But for those two days, police focused on the possibility that
Paolo might have wandered away and met with foul play in the park
next door. Once the body was discovered, LAPD Deputy Chief David
Kalish inadvertently added to the Ayala family's anguish by at first
insisting that someone must have dumped the body overnight, raising
fears of a grisly murder. On Wednesday, the county coroner confirmed
that the boy died Sunday as a result of an accidental drowning--he
didn't know how to swim--and that his body had been in the murky pool
all along.</TE>
<TE>   However, the real lesson of young Paolo's death, the one that
makes every parent shiver, is how instantly laughter can turn to
tragedy. Avert your eyes from the pool, just for a minute, to finish
a magazine article. Run for the telephone in the kitchen with a child
hanging from the backyard jungle gym. Leave a child in the grocery
cart in a crowded store while you grab a quart of milk on another
aisle.</TE>
<TE>   Tragic, avoidable accidents don't discriminate, every year
claiming rich and poor children alike, those whose parents are
distracted and exasperated and those who, like Franklin and Edwina
Ayala, loved their son to pieces, trusting his safety in others'
hands.</TE>
<TE>   Another Southern California summer upon us. May Paolo Ayala's
needless death teach, and spare others an unspeakable heartbreak.</TE>

<LD>President Bush's vow Thursday to carry out the most sweeping
restructuring of government since the beginning of the Cold War in
1947 comes at a similarly pivotal moment. For weeks, administration
officials have reminded us that the forces that brought down the
World Trade Center haven't evaporated, that someday a hatemonger with
a twisted vision of jihad or some new breed of terrorist could
detonate a weapon of mass destruction in Chicago, Omaha or Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Americans must fundamentally rethink how much power we give our
government to protect us from enemies abroad and at home. Speed is
essential. But people must not allow themselves to be panicked into
embracing measures that undermine the freedoms that make this country
worth defending.</LD>
<LD>   Critics say it's no coincidence that Bush's proposal to elevate
the Office of Homeland Security to Cabinet status and to broaden its
powers came as Congress opened hearings to grill the FBI and CIA on
the intelligence lapses that failed to prevent the 9/11 attacks. No
matter. Bush's plan, which Congress must approve, breaks the
intellectual and policy logjam that has left America vulnerable. As
the FBI and CIA dish dirt on each other's 9/11 failures, no one seems
to be doing much creative, strategic thinking about how to avoid a
repetition of that awful day.</LD>
<TE>   The president's plan seeks to end the confusing patchwork of
agencies responsible for security and place them under the umbrella
of a Department of Homeland Security. The new, permanent entity would
draw from eight Cabinet departments to create four divisions,
responsible for border and transportation; emergency preparedness and
response; chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear
countermeasures; and intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   The last division would probably prove most immediately valuable,
and its creation would need the most scrutiny. The refusal of the FBI
and CIA to cooperate in the months and years before last September
clearly crippled America's defenses. The proposed department, by
contrast, would be able to gather information from each area of
government--FBI, CIA, Customs Service, Coast Guard and Immigration
and Naturalization (or the proposed new agency that may replace the
INS).</TE>
<TE>   Precise and accurate intelligence that has been coordinated by a
single agency could disrupt or foil future attacks. But with such
power comes the danger of abuse, and Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, for
one, has already shown a disturbing disregard for civil liberties in
his treatment of detainees swept up after the September attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Governments are, by nature, power hungry. In a democracy, people
have the responsibility to keep the power for themselves--in this
case, to make sure fear of terrorism doesn't cause a slide toward
tyranny. Americans want protection, but on their own terms.</TE>
<TE>   The impassioned debate that will shape Bush's plan is a sign of
how robust this democracy remains. The discussion must grapple with
practical matters: How, for instance, can Congress keep the new
Cabinet post from becoming another paper-shuffling bureaucracy? But
the proposal also will force a wider reckoning with the philosophical
debate triggered by 9/11.</TE>
<TE>   Freedom and security need not be incompatible, even as the U.S. is
locked in what Bush called a "titanic struggle" against terrorists.
But figuring out how to strike the precise balance will require even
more determination than it took to clean up ground zero--which
remains the clearest possible reminder of the urgent need to make the
nation more secure.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Explanation for Fatal Chase Offered," June 5: The death of
4-year-old Evelyn Vargas, while extremely tragic, was not caused by
the act of a police officer pursuing a fleeing suspect. Make no
mistake about it; this was not a traffic accident. This was a
premeditated act by the driver of the stolen BMW who purposely chose
not to stop for the police. This suspect decided to hurtle down a
busy street in a 2,000-plus-pound "missile" without regard to
anyone's safety.</LD>
<LD>   Place the blame squarely where it belongs--on the driver of the
stolen car who failed to obey the law. If he had stopped, or better
yet, if he had never stolen the car, this incident would not have
happened.</LD>
<LD>   Sgt. Scott Anderson</LD>
<TE>   Maywood Police Department</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The chase was "well within policy," said a commander of the LAPD
(June 2), yet another parent lost a child. How many dead children,
spouses, brothers or sisters will it take for the LAPD to change its
policy on car pursuits? Why risk the death and injury of innocent
bystanders to catch a car thief?</TE>
<TE>   We have to trust our police officers to make on-the-spot
decisions, but I believe that we need to demand that the officers on
the street get better guidelines from their superiors on when the
risk of not apprehending a suspect outweighs the perils of a pursuit.
I think retrieving a stolen car is not worth the risk of any life.</TE>
<TE>   Gerlinde Gautrey</TE>
<TE>   Topanga</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD did not force anyone to steal a BMW from the Hollywood
area; the individual concerned chose to do that of his own free will.
When officers encountered the individual driving the stolen BMW, they
did not force him to speed away. And when the officers did their job
and pursued the stolen vehicle and a crime in progress, they did not
force the driver to run the red light at 6th and Spring streets. The
LAPD did not kill Evelyn Vargas; the person who stole the BMW, ran
from the LAPD and failed to stop at a red light is the one who killed
her.</TE>
<TE>   It could be argued that if the LAPD had not chased the stolen BMW
the driver may not have run the red light and the little girl would
still be alive today; but if the driver had not stolen the BMW, the
LAPD would have had no reason to chase him.</TE>
<TE>   If my 2-year-old son had been killed Saturday, I would be
grief-stricken, but I would not blame the LAPD; I would blame the
driver of the stolen BMW. It was his decisions--made with his own
free will--that directly caused the tragic death of Evelyn Vargas.</TE>

<LD>Re "Police May Have Missed Boy's Body," June 5: With great sadness I
read the story of the drowned 7-year-old boy. As a mother myself I
can only imagine the horrible grief the family of Paolo Ayala must be
feeling. I've been a house manager for a very wealthy family and have
organized many children's birthday parties. One was a pool party in
which I hired two certified lifeguards to work the duration of the
party.</LD>
<LD>   In my experience it is not enough to count on parents, who often
are taking care of their own children, or the house staff, as they
too have many commitments. The lifeguards were hired to stay by the
pool even when the children were off to another area. They left once
all the children left, period.</LD>
<LD>   Pool safety is nothing to be taken lightly. You can find certified
lifeguards through your local swim schools, parks and even children's
party agencies.</LD>

<LD>Re "From Africa, Milk of Human Kindness," June 3: The gift of 14 cows
by the impoverished African village has to be one of the most
significant events flowing from Sept. 11. I hope every American
ponders its meaning and experiences the humility that turns out to be
the gift behind the gift.</LD>
<LD>   It may never happen again, but the fact that people in this small,
poor village had it in their hearts to do this wonderful thing for us
speaks volumes about the human spirit and doing the right thing. May
we take care to do the right thing.</LD>

<TE>   A funny thing happened on my way to reading about the Lakers in
the sports pages. I stumbled on the first section, and was entranced
by articles about defections in the Bush administration, fruit fly
research and misinformation about bombing campaigns. In one hour I
was treated to quality investigative reporting, a lucid scientific
story and a tale of bombing politicization that was both strange and
ghoulish.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there was the story of the Masai and the cows. For the
first time in 45 years, a newspaper story made me burst into tears.
The Times is truly a beacon.</TE>

<LD>I read "Justice Is Blind to Scientific Evidence" (Commentary, June
3), wherein Bart Kosko says, in so many contemptuous words (seeming
to confuse opinion with science), that persons in disagreement with
his opinion that "humans developed from earlier species of animals"
essentially have oatmeal between their ears.</LD>
<LD>   Can he really be so self-deluded to think that people who refuse
to bow to his desperately held belief in evolution do so without
careful consideration of the facts? Can a USC professor who may
believe, ultimately, that the entire unimaginably massive universe
derived from absolutely nothing be a good judge of those with acumen
and those without? But, of course, just remind everyone that this
logical impossibility occurred over bazillions of years and somehow
that will sanitize the utter foolishness of it. We've lost our minds
... but worse yet, our souls.</LD>

<LD>   President Bush claims that he ended the Cold War, but his promise
(or threat) to retain 2,000 warheads--with the others in storage--for
the next decade is not an end to the Cold War. I define the end of
the Cold War as that time when there are no longer enough nuclear
weapons to destroy the world.</LD>

it or not, most terrorist acts over the last 30 years have been
perpetrated by male Muslim extremists. Common sense tells us that
future attacks are likely to come from the same source. But we must
not acknowledge that fact.</LD>

<HD>Connerly Plans to Take Race Out of the Record</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Connerly Initiative Promotes Racial Balkanization" (Commentary, June
4), the eloquent attack on UC Regent Ward Connerly's Racial Privacy
Initiative, does not go far enough. Connerly's colorblind approach
was tried in the 1940s and 1950s but failed, so why does he want to
foist a phony nostrum upon Californians?</LD>
<LD>   The Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires employers and public
agencies to compile data on race and sex. To have any integrity,
Connerly should first propose that California secede from the United
States before dismantling a commitment to racial justice for which so
many gave their lives. In Hawaii, where half the population is
racially mixed, overt racial identifications are a matter of pride
and thus of mutual respect and aloha (love). Instead of making a
self-contradictory assertion that intermarriage in California will
make his own proposition moot, Connerly should visit the Aloha State
and read about the history to learn what racial harmony is all about.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Haas</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'm confused. Connerly now wants any reference to race erased from
a great body of the public record (and so will eliminate its huge
value as a source of readily available statistical data). I'm
guessing that one-on-one racial awareness would continue, unless
offices are to be staffed and interviews conducted by the blind, in
bold support of the Americans With Disabilities Act. Oh, but then we
would need to be unaware of blindness.... I think I'm getting a
headache!</TE>
<TE>   And yet the UC regents won the right to set racial quotas for
research purposes at UCLA's University Elementary School in Hunter
vs. Regents. Is UC playing both ends against some kind of undefined
middle, or is it just mutual ignorance of the right hand and left
hand in tracking each other's activities? I'm very confused.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Playa Vista School Plan Is Up in the Air," May 30: The problems
at the Playa Vista site are not just methane or toxics from the
former Howard Hughes plant site. There are also problems with
hydrogen sulfide, a toxic oilfield gas that can cause permanent brain
damage. High amounts of H2S at the Playa Vista site were documented
in the Playa Vista archeology reports, as well as in L.A. city
records that showed workers getting sick from H2S on the site.</LD>
<LD>   Because building on this wetland requires thousands of
pilings--which act as conduits to bring the underground gases up to
the surface--it increases the risk of students and residents being
exposed to these toxins. In our opinion, it would be a much safer,
healthier alternative to leave this land open space and restore it as
a wetland/wildlife refuge.</LD>

<LD>I ride a sport bike. The two riders in "Filling the Need for Speed"
(June 5) are what we refer to in the sport bike community as
"squids." Totally irresponsible; in fact, they each seem to have a
death wish. The majority of us don't even come close to the antics
they display. The article sensationalizes the acts of a few at the
expense of many.</LD>
<LD>   Although the number from the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety may be correct, the rise in deaths may be attributed to a
trend by baby boomers to buy Harley Davidsons. I have a great respect
for true bikers and their Harleys. But the baby boomers are buying in
greater numbers and, having little experience, are crashing in
greater numbers. It was irresponsible for The Times to have printed
this article.</LD>

<LD>The Los Angeles Police Department's bike unit will once again be able
to train its officers in Griffith Park after a compromise pushed
through this week by city officials.</LD>
<LD>   The board of the Recreation and Park Department voted 5-0
Wednesday to allow LAPD bike training at the park's dormant Toyon
Canyon landfill, settling a dispute that had placed police between
bikers and residents worried about park paths.</LD>
<LD>   The LAPD's bike unit had used Griffith and Elysian parks since the
early 1980s, teaching about 100 officers a year how to navigate on
dirt paths, an element of bike officer education required by state
law enforcement regulations.</LD>
<TE>   But late last year, the LAPD was suddenly forced to stop training
in the parks after a vocal core of residents complained that the bike
riding was a safety and environmental menace. The city attorney's
office then reviewed the matter, finding an ordinance mandating that
no biking--even by police--should be allowed on any dirt trails in
any of the city's parks. Left without the ability to train on the
very dirt paths they could use if responding to an emergency, the
LAPD was forced to suspend its classes.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Tom LaBonge came up with a compromise, proposing
legislation allowing police to use the dirt-covered landfill up to 96
hours a year. The bill passed the council unanimously last month and
was rubber-stamped Wednesday by the park board.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Soter, a member of the Los Feliz Home Improvement Assn., a
community bordering Griffith Park, said the compromise sat well with
his neighbors: "We thought something could be worked out that was
fair to all."</TE>
<TE>   Lurking beneath the bike patrol issue are deep tensions between
those who want to ensure that bikes are never allowed on dirt paths
in city parks and members of the bike community who have been pushing
for more access.</TE>
<TE>   Staff at the park commission, which had studied opening some parks
to bikes in 2000, only to back down as the debate grew, is now
considering holding a public meeting to explore allowing local
residents more say in the issue on a park-by-park basis.</TE>

<HD>Officials Expect Dental Records to Identify Body as
Altadena Girl's</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Butte County authorities on Thursday were waiting for dental records
to positively identify a body they found Wednesday as that of missing
11-year-old Jeanene Bonner of Altadena.</LD>
<LD>   The body was found under a blanket less than a quarter of a mile
from the pickup truck where Bonner's father, Joaquin Garcia, 35, had
committed suicide.</LD>
<LD>   A sheriff's investigator in the Northern California county, Sgt.
Andy Duch, said the Downey truck driver is believed to have shot his
daughter in the head before killing himself. Her bloody clothes were
found in the pickup with Garcia's body last week.</LD>
<TE>   Bonner had been with her father for several days of visitation on
a trip starting May 21 that took them from Southern California to Las
Vegas and then, mysteriously, hundreds of miles to Northern
California. Her mother and father did not live together.</TE>
<TE>   Bonner's mother, Kim Almodovar, was not available for comment
Thursday, but Duch said she had been cooperating closely with the
search.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the Polly Klaas Foundation, the group founded
after the kidnap-murder of a 12-year-old girl in Petaluma, said
statistics show that children are killed more often by their parents
than by outsiders.</TE>
<TE>   The Klaas Foundation had offered its services to Bonner's family
after she disappeared. The spokeswoman, Jenni Thompson, said that
although it is natural for a child to trust in a parent, it is also
true that "people need to be aware that children are sometimes at
risk from parents."</TE>
<TE>   Almodovar said at a news conference Friday that Garcia had been
behaving strangely for about a year, cutting his ties with friends,
taking drugs and exhibiting streaks of bad temper with his daughter.
However, she said that he had returned her more or less on time from
other visitations.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson said, however, that "Jeanene's mother was at no fault
whatsoever in this tragedy. She did what she was supposed to
do--allow the father visitation--and it would have taken a long court
process to change the terms of that."</TE>
<TE>   Bonner was a sixth-grade honor student at Loma Alta Elementary
School in Altadena. School spokesman Erik Nasarenko said Thursday
that a team of counselors has been sent to the school to help any
students or teachers feeling stress as a result of what has happened.</TE>
<TE>   The parents, faculty and community supporters of Loma Alta school
will hold a memorial vigil tonight at 7:45 p.m. in Farnsworth Park,
near the school, at Lake and Mount Curve avenues.</TE>

<HD>Inquiry Into Fatal Shooting Clears Officer</HD>
<DH>Oxnard: District attorney concludes death of mentally ill
man in 2001 confrontation was justified, but criticizes police
training, tactics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County prosecutors Thursday cleared an Oxnard police officer
who fatally shot a distraught 23-year-old artist, but also found that
the high-profile shooting may have resulted from faulty tactics by
officers poorly trained in dealing with the mentally ill.</LD>
<LD>   Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury concluded that veteran Oxnard
Officer George Tamayo acted in self-defense when he killed Robert
Jones Jr. last summer, since the officer feared for his colleagues'
lives when Jones moved toward them from his bedroom closet with a
kitchen knife.</LD>
<LD>   "Officer Tamayo honestly and reasonably believed that Mr. Jones
was attacking Sgt. [Fred] Sedillos," Bradbury concluded in a 133-page
analysis.</LD>
<TE>   In a separate investigation, the state attorney general's office
reported this week that the Jones shooting "was a justifiable
homicide and not a criminal act."</TE>
<TE>   But Bradbury also suggested that Oxnard police unnecessarily
forced the life-and-death confrontation, and that officers could have
dealt better with a depressed young man who needed medical treatment
and was not a crime suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Jones was killed the morning of Aug. 24 after his mother --
concerned over her son's threat against her husband the night before
and worried that Jones might hurt himself -- called police in the
hope that they would take him to a hospital for treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Jones was shot when he refused to drop an 8-inch butcher knife,
retreated into a closet, then rose toward officers when they forced
him out.</TE>
<TE>   Tamayo shot Jones after a superior's plan to use a chemical spray
to flush Jones out of his closet did not unfold as expected, the
report said. "[The] plan seems to assume that Jones would come out of
the closet unarmed."</TE>
<TE>   "We're not saying that nothing was wrong," Chief Assistant Dist.
Atty. Greg Totten said in an interview. "We're just saying from a
purely legal standpoint, Tamayo's shooting was justified.</TE>
<TE>   "Police officers are trained to take control of a situation,"
Totten added. "And that doesn't always work with the mentally ill."</TE>
<TE>   In his report, Bradbury cites a separate analysis by consulting
psychologist Joel Dvoskin on how police tactics could have
contributed to the Jones shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "This does not appear to be a case of intentional police
misconduct," wrote Dvoskin, an expert in dealing with mentally ill
crime suspects. "The errors that were made resulted from inadequate
information, bad judgment, or inadequate training; more likely, the
cause of this tragedy was a combination of all three."</TE>
<TE>   Dvoskin was particularly critical of supervising officer Sedillos'
decision to use a beanbag shotgun and pepper spray to disarm Jones
even though he was not an apparent threat and the use of force likely
heightened Jones' sense of being under attack. The officers were not
aware of a warning from Jones' mother to a police dispatcher that her
son disliked and distrusted police.</TE>
<TE>   After sliding open a closet door with a gun barrel, Sedillos shot
the crouching Jones with a beanbag for the third time, the report
noted. That prompted Jones to rise and Tamayo to shoot Jones with his
handgun, striking the man in the chest.</TE>
<TE>   "Sgt. Sedillos erred badly in his decision to fire a 'beanbag
shotgun,' " Dvoskin said. And pepper spray "could only be expected to
increase the general sense of chaos, panic and fear."</TE>
<TE>   The preferred strategy with the mentally ill, Dvoskin said, is to
slow things down, not to escalate them.</TE>
<TE>   The Bradbury report upset Jones' family, while police generally
saw it as thorough and fair.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not surprised, I'm disappointed," said Gabriella Navaro
Busch, lawyer for Jones' mother, Ida Perkins. "The facts, as we see
them, are different."</TE>
<TE>   Based on Bradbury's history, she said, it was almost a foregone
conclusion that he would find the shooting justified.</TE>
<TE>   "This county's been consistent, so despite the apparent facts in
this case, the county still ruled the shooting justified," Busch
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Ida calls the police for help, and the police come and kill her
son," she said. "Why isn't it shoddy police work?"</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez said the report contains valuable
recommendations on improving officer training. Oxnard has already
implemented some of them since the Jones shooting, training 16
officers so far in special 40-hour classes on how to recognize
mentally ill people and deal with them.</TE>
<TE>   Additional training of supervising officers will come, Lopez said,
and he pledged to work with mental health officials to put mental
health workers and officers in the same patrol car.</TE>
<TE>   He would not comment on police tactics, citing two pending federal
lawsuits by Jones' parents. But he defended the actions of his
officers.</TE>
<TE>   "You can always look back and say things could have been done
better," he said. "Unfortunately, these officers don't have that
luxury."</TE>
<TE>   As things were, Bradbury found that Tamayo handled himself well.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to calm Jones, the officer called him "buddy" and "Rob."
He repeatedly offered to put his badge on the floor if Jones would
put his knife on top of it, according to a tape recording of the
incident.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you want to go get some help? I'll go with you. I'll help you
out," Tamayo said midway through their 20-minute exchange. "Give you
a ride up there and talk to somebody. Is that all right? Is that
cool? Talk to me, buddy, tell me how you feel."</TE>
<TE>   At one point Jones said: "What did I do? ... Make me a deal...."
At another, he said, "You shouldn't have to do this." And as officers
backed Jones into a corner, he said: "Everyone knows the
consequences, right?" a comment that officers considered a threat.</TE>
<TE>   After reviewing transcripts, officer and witness statements,
Dvoskin concluded that Tamayo's "actions, in every regard, appear to
have been beyond reproach."</TE>
<TE>   At the time, however, the shooting prompted an uproar partly
because it was the fifth homicide in the first eight months of 2001
by Oxnard police, more than peace officers in many U.S. states and
major American cities kill in an entire year.</TE>
<TE>   The Jones case also fueled claims of racial profiling by Oxnard
police, since a spokesman for the National Assn. for the Advancement
of Colored People claimed Jones had twice been arrested because of
racial bias in the months before his death, and was depressed because
of it.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and the state attorney general's office conducted civil
rights investigations. The federal inquiry is ongoing.</TE>
<TE>   All five of those killed in Oxnard police shootings last year were
Latino or black. Police have said four were mentally ill. Bradbury
has found each of the shootings justified.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1992, Bradbury has found 30 of 31 fatal police shootings to
be justified. In the other case, he found that one Oxnard officer
killed another in an accident during a 1996 drug raid.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, prosecutors have ruled that the 20 fatal
police shootings in 2001 for which investigations have been completed
so far were justified. In Orange County, prosecutors have found all
five fatal shootings by police last year justified.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, a police officer may use deadly force when
circumstances create a reasonable fear of death or serious bodily
injury in the mind of the officer.</TE>

<HD>Defense Targets Van Dam Lifestyle</HD>
<DH>Trial: Mother of slain girl spurns notion that couple's
social habits endangered daughter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A tearful Brenda van Dam sharply rejected defense suggestions
Thursday that her sexually permissive lifestyle exposed her daughter,
Danielle, to a deadly kidnapping.</LD>
<LD>   The suburban San Diego mother told a jury of her terror and
confusion the morning in early February when she discovered that her
7-year-old daughter was missing from her room.</LD>
<LD>   When defense attorney Steven Feldman probed about the customs in
her home, Van Dam responded icily: "There's never been a sex party at
my house."</LD>
<TE>   The 39-year-old mother weathered four hours on the stand, her
testimony clear but at times halting. At one point, Van Dam glared
directly at David Westerfield, who lived two doors away in the
upscale Sabre Springs neighborhood and is now accused of kidnapping
and murdering Danielle Van Dam. Westerfield returned her gaze and
remained impassive.</TE>
<TE>   The murder defendant's attorney asked repeatedly about the sex
habits of Van Dam and her husband, Damon, and whether they had sexual
relations with the two women who came to their home and smoked
marijuana and drank beer with them the night Danielle disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Brenda van Dam later went out with the two women to a neighborhood
bar for a night of drinking and dancing--leaving her husband to watch
Danielle and the couple's two sons. The next morning, Danielle was
gone.</TE>
<TE>   The defense has said the lifestyle issues are relevant because
those invited into the Van Dam home for sex and marijuana should have
been considered as suspects.</TE>
<TE>   During a break in her four hours of testimony, Van Dam began
sobbing and virtually collapsed into the arms of Deputy Dist. Atty.
Jeff Dusek. The prosecutor embraced her, spoke quietly in her ear,
and helped dry tears on her cheeks. The jury was not present.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman had protested to Superior Court Judge William Mudd on
Wednesday that jurors might be influenced by seeing Van Dam crying in
the courthouse hallway while waiting for her husband to finish
testifying.</TE>
<TE>   While Damon van Dam was largely stoic during his testi- mony --
which also dealt with marijuana use and sex habits--Brenda Van Dam
appeared on the verge of breaking down on the stand. She frequently
asked Feldman to repeat his questions and, at several points, looked
imploringly at Dusek.</TE>
<TE>   "He [Feldman] keeps confusing me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning by Feldman, she conceded that she and her
husband had had sex with another couple in their home in the months
before Danielle disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't consider that to be a sex party," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman asked a series of questions about Van Dam's purported
habits--suggestive dancing, risque Halloween parties and contact with
both men and women. Prosecutor Dusek objected to several of the
queries.</TE>
<TE>   After a strenuous objection, Mudd told Van Dam she did not have to
answer Feldman's question about whether she would "observe your
husband looking at naked 20-year-olds."</TE>
<TE>   Justin Brooks, executive director of the Institute for Criminal
Defense Advocacy at California Western School of Law, said that while
Feldman's questioning of the grieving Brenda van Dam may seem
"horrible," it is Feldman's job to determine "the level of control in
the house and who had access to the home."</TE>
<TE>   Noting that Feldman took a less assertive tone with Brenda van Dam
than with her husband, Brooks said: "I think Feldman did a good job
of covering the ground. If he had been sharper, she might have broken
down and been unable to testify at all."</TE>
<TE>   In his opening statement this week, Feldman suggested it made more
sense that someone familiar with the home, not Westerfield, committed
the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Those who had been inside the Van Dam home before would much more
likely have made a stealthy entrance and known which bedroom
contained the sleeping child, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors allege that neighbor Westerfield sneaked into the
home around midnight Feb. 1 and kidnapped Danielle, later suffocating
her and dumping her body in a rural area 40 miles from the Sabre
Springs neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Her body was too decomposed to determine the cause of death or
whether she had been molested, the county medical examiner testified
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Dusek alleges that Westerfield harbored fantasies about having sex
with underage girls and kept a voluminous collection of child
pornography at his home. The prosecutor said that Danielle's hair and
blood were found in Westerfield's recreational vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Before Brenda van Dam's emotional testimony, jurors heard the
mother's anguished 911 call. Judge Mudd overruled a defense objection
that the tape would prejudice the jury.</TE>
<TE>   "My daughter is not in her bed this morning. She's only 7.... Oh
my God! . . . Oh my God! . . . Oh my God!" says a panicky Van Dam as
she gasped for breath.</TE>
<TE>   "Take a deep breath, OK?" says the 911 operator. "Think confident
thoughts and everything will be OK."</TE>

<HD>Paul Gottlieb, 67; Art Publisher Made Catalogs Into
Bestsellers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Gottlieb, whose prescience about the expanding public appetite
for art led him to the top of the art publishing world, died of an
apparent heart attack Wednesday at his home in New York. He was 67.</LD>
<LD>   Gottlieb spent two decades at Harry N. Abrams, the largest
publisher of art and illustrated books in the country. He retired
last year as publisher, president and editor in chief but retained
his position as vice chairman of its parent company, La Martiniere
Groupe.</LD>
<LD>   He resigned the vice chairmanship in May when he became executive
director of the Aperture Foundation, which produces high-quality
photography books and a quarterly photographic magazine.</LD>
<TE>   Gottlieb left an impressive imprint on the field of art
publishing, notably by broadening the mainstream market for opulently
produced exhibition catalogs. One of the last of these he shepherded
was "Hidden Treasures Revealed," published by Abrams in 1995 to
accompany an exhibit of Impressionist and post-Impressionist art at
the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. It sold more
than 100,000 copies--at $49.50 each--at a time when sales of 40,000
in the art book world was considered unusually good.</TE>
<TE>   Another legendary publishing figure, Roger W. Straus Jr., told the
New York Times recently, "The best thing I can say for him is that
Paul is in a very difficult and interesting racket. The kind of books
he publishes are very expensive. Not an easy task, and I think there
are only two other publishers like him in America."</TE>
<TE>   Another Gottlieb coup involved a series of secret portraits by
Andrew Wyeth, which the publisher helped bring to the National
Gallery of Art in Washington in 1987. The Helga series, so called
because they concentrated on a blond, blue-eyed neighbor named Helga
Testorf who posed for Wyeth over a 15-year period, caused a sensation
when Wyeth's wife said she had not known of his obsession with the
woman and described the works with one word: "love."</TE>
<TE>   The accompanying Abrams book sold more than 500,000 copies and
became the first art book to appear as a main selection of the
Book-of-the-Month Club.</TE>
<TE>   "He had an impresario's flair," Eric Himmel, the current editor in
chief of Abrams, said of his predecessor, a towering (6 feet 5
inches) man known for his vast connections and infectious joie de
vivre.</TE>
<TE>   His arrival at Abrams in 1979 coincided with a decadelong
expansion in museum attendance in America. "Paul was able to see that
it was really museums who controlled an enormous amount of popular
content that a broad market would be hungry for .... He used his
enormous contacts to begin to change the perception of the museum
catalog into ... a popular book for an audience that appreciated
art," Himmel said.</TE>
<TE>   Gottlieb doubled the company's revenue and number of titles within
a decade of joining it. He expanded its textbook program, in
particular by rejuvenating H.W. Janson's "History of Art," the
best-known and best-selling art survey in the English language. He
also launched a children's book division, which has published a
number of bestsellers by author and illustrator Graeme Base.</TE>
<TE>   Born just a few blocks from the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
Gottlieb was the son of Russian emigres who exposed him to the
cultural riches of the city. His father, an accountant, knew the
comic actor Zero Mostel. His mother was a lover of classic Russian
literature who worked as a translator and spoke to her son only in
Russian, one of three languages he spoke fluently.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Liza, survives him along with his second wife,
Elisabeth Scharlatt; sons Nicholas of New York and Andrew of Los
Angeles; stepson Nicholas Scharlatt of New York; a sister, and two
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Gottlieb once described himself as a "wastrel" in his youth. He
was expelled from Swarthmore College for a semester after a
"paralyzingly good time" spent in pursuit of women and wine. The
college suggested that he join the Army; instead, he got a job in the
mailroom of the William Morris Agency. He later graduated from the
college with a degree in political science.</TE>
<TE>   He briefly considered a career in diplomacy and worked as a
Russian interpreter. He eventually abandoned the idea of a foreign
service career when he saw that being Jewish was an impediment.</TE>
<TE>   He landed in publishing in 1962 with a job at American Heritage
Publishing Co., where he became publisher of Horizon and American
Heritage magazines.</TE>
<TE>   He left the company in 1975 as president and publisher, and four
years later succeeded Harry Abrams as head of the Abrams publishing
house.</TE>
<TE>   One of his first major successes came in 1983 with the publication
of the catalog for "The Vatican Collections: The Papacy and Art" show
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. "The Treasures of the Vatican"
established the glossy art catalog as a new genre.</TE>
<TE>   He followed it a few years later with another bestseller, "The
National Geographic Society: 100 Years of Adventure and Discovery."
Published in 1987, it was the first illustrated main selection of the
Literary Guild and sold more than 1 million copies.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the books produced during his 23 years at Abrams were more
than 10 years in the making. But one of his greatest successes--the
lavish catalog of the Hermitage exhibit--was rushed into print in a
record six months.</TE>
<TE>   The project came about when he received a phone call in 1994 that
something was afoot at the St. Petersburg museum. A few months later
he was winding through endless corridors of the former home of
Russian czars to a room containing 74 paintings looted from a Berlin
bunker by Soviet authorities during World War II. Most of the
works--by artists including Monet, Renoir, Van Gogh, Gauguin,
Cezanne, Degas and Matisse--had never been seen by the public.
Gottlieb was the first person outside of the Hermitage staff to see
the paintings, worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "Hidden Treasures Revealed" became the second fine-art book to be
featured as a main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club.</TE>
<TE>   Gottlieb was known for his conviviality and great curiosity.
During his early years at Abrams, he moonlighted behind the counter
of a Madison Avenue bookstore.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to find out what people were buying,'' Himmel said,
"but he also did it because he enjoyed meeting people who were buying
his books.''</TE>

<HD>Man Arrested in Slayings of Jewelry Store Owners</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A longtime acquaintance of a Toluca Lake jewelry store owner was
arrested Thursday on suspicion of killing the jeweler and his wife
during a robbery last month, Los Angeles police said.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Fereydun Shahidzaeh, 55, was low on money and the car
he lived in had been impounded May 25, the day that jewelers Garbis
and Mayda Tarakjian were fatally shot in their store.</LD>
<LD>   Garbis Tarakjian, 52, and his wife, Mayda, 45, were found dead
beside the front door of their shop, Elegant Creations in Fine
Jewelry, at 4219 Lankershim Blvd.</LD>
<TE>   Using a police sketch drawn from witness reports and a
surveillance video from a nearby car dealership, Garbis Tarakjian's
sons identified a man seen on the video leaving the jewelry store and
carrying a white bag as an acquaintance of their father called Fred.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Fred is Shahidzaeh, who they said worked on and off in
hotel maintenance. Shahidzaeh and Garbis Tarakjian had lent each
other money over the years, Los Angeles Police Det. Mike Coffey said.</TE>
<TE>   "When one of them needed money, the other one would help out,"
Coffey said. But outstanding debts did not appear to be a motive in
the killings, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Shahidzaeh lived in his 1977 Pontiac Firebird, and patrol officers
remembered talking to him in the past, Coffey said.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday afternoon, two officers saw Shahidzaeh parked at
Beverly Garland's Holiday Inn in North Hollywood and arrested him,
police said. In his car they found jewelry and a 9-millimeter handgun
believed to be the weapon used in the killings.</TE>
<TE>   The store had been burglarized in February, and in the weeks
before the slayings its telephone wires had been repeatedly cut, but
the burglary and vandalism have not been connected to Shahidzaeh,
Coffey said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Shahidzaeh is expected to be charged and
arraigned Monday.</TE>

<LD>Freeman King, an actor and comedian best known for his appearances on
"The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour" in the 1970s, has died. He was 59.</LD>
<LD>   King, who fashioned a career as a character actor in films and
television, died of a heart attack in Los Angeles on his birthday,
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Born on a farm in Pelahatchie, Miss., King moved to California in
the early 1960s and graduated from Compton High School in 1962. He
studied drama at Los Angeles City College.</LD>
<TE>   While doing stand-up comedy at Redd Foxx's club in Los Angeles,
Foxx suggested that King team up with Canadian comedian Murray
Langston, who was also working there. This led to a role on the
weekly "The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour" from 1971 to 1974. He later
appeared as disc jockey "Dr. D" on the popular program "Dance Fever."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, King appeared in television shows such as
"Hunter," "Moonlighting," "Hill Street Blues," "The Incredible Hulk"
and "Starsky &amp; Hutch." He also showed up as a panelist on shows
including "The Match Game," "The Gong Show" and "The $1.98 Beauty
Show."</TE>
<TE>   King is survived by his wife, Fe King; a son from a previous
marriage, John Freeman King; two sisters and two brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial services will be held at 1 p.m. Saturday at
Utter-McKinley San Fernando Mission Mortuary, 11071 Columbus Avenue,
Mission Hills.</TE>

<HD>Sandor Konya, 78; Wagnerian Tenor at the Met 1961-74</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sandor Konya, a Hungarian-born tenor with a dramatic, powerful voice
who became a fixture at New York's Metropolitan Opera for 14 seasons,
has died. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Konya died May 20 at his home on the Spanish island of Ibiza,
local music critic Pedro Echarte said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Konya had a broad repertoire, including several major Verdi and
Puccini roles, but he was best known as a Wagnerian tenor. He was
part of the Met roster from 1961 to 1974.</LD>
<TE>   Born in 1923 in Sarkad, Hungary, Konya studied in Hungary, Italy
and Germany. In 1951, he made his professional debut as Turiddu in
Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana" at the Bielefeld Opera.</TE>
<TE>   He performed extensively in Germany before joining the roster of
the Deutsche Oper, then called the Stadtische Oper, Berlin, in 1955.</TE>
<TE>   In 1960, he made his American debut as Dick Johnson in Puccini's
"Fanciulla del West" at the San Francisco Opera, and his debut at
Milan's La Scala as Parsifal.</TE>
<TE>   In 1961, he made his debut in Los Angeles in Verdi's "Aida" and
Puccini's "Turandot."</TE>
<TE>   His success at the Richard Wagner festival in Bayreuth, Germany,
in the title role of "Lohengrin" led to an invitation to perform in
the same role at the Met in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   In his later years, Konya toured Europe, Japan and South America
and made several recordings.</TE>
<TE>   Retired Hungarian opera critic Laszlo Dalos said Konya didn't
become known in his native country until after the 1956 Hungarian
Revolution, when "we began to take notice of his Hungarian name on
the foreign opera circuits."</TE>
<TE>   Konya performed for the first time in Hungary in 1964, singing at
the State Opera House and at open-air festivals and returning every
three or four years, Dalos said.</TE>
<TE>   "We regarded him very much as a product of a German training," the
Hungarian critic added.</TE>
<TE>   Konya moved to Ibiza in the 1980s and started Pro Arte, a local
foundation to promote the operatic arts with productions throughout
the season patronized by the island's many foreign residents, said
Echarte, who is vice president of the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Konya's wife died last year. He is survived by a son and a
brother.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police said Thursday that they have arrested two young men who may be
connected to a string of robberies targeting downtown parking lot
attendants.</LD>
<LD>   The suspects were arrested about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday, shortly
after they allegedly confronted an attendant at 1355 S. Flower St.
and took his money and cell phone, police said.</LD>
<LD>   "Based on their overall appearance and MO, we feel we probably
have the right guys," said Lt. Andy Monsue of the Los Angeles Police
Department's Central Division.</LD>
<TE>   Monsue was referring to a series of similar robberies over the
last three weeks. In each incident attendants have been approached,
threatened and robbed of money and personal items by two men.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects, a 17-year-old and 18-year-old, were arrested after
patrol officers who had been alerted to the robberies saw them
leaving a parking structure.</TE>
<TE>   They each will be charged with one count of robbery, the
lieutenant said.</TE>
<TE>   "If they get identified by other victims, we'll ask [the district
attorney] to file additional counts," Monsue said.</TE>

<HD>Radioactive Waste Still Gets Dumped</HD>
<DH>Safety: Health officials cite U.S. law in allowing
disposal. Judge had set aside a similar state rule.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- State health officials said Thursday that they're
continuing to permit companies and researchers to dump low-level
radioactive waste at landfills, despite a judge's ruling last month
that seemed to prohibit such dumping.</LD>
<LD>   Department of Health Services Director Diana M. Bonta said that
although the state judge struck down a state regulation permitting
the dumping, federal law allows it as long as the waste has the
lowest "reasonably achievable" level of radiation, not to exceed 25
millirems a year, which is roughly equal to two and a half chest
X-rays.</LD>
<LD>   In November, acting without a public hearing, the health services
department adopted a regulation that followed the federal standard.</LD>
<TE>   But Superior Court Judge Gayle Ohanesian of Sacramento, ruling on
a lawsuit by the anti-nuclear group Committee to Bridge the Gap,
concluded that the state failed to properly follow the California
Environmental Quality Act and deemed the regulation invalid.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning Thursday by state senators, Bonta acknowledged
that despite the ruling, the state continues to permit operators to
abandon research sites with low-level radiation and dispose of waste
once they comply with what essentially is the same standard.</TE>
<TE>   "The vast majority are going to be extremely low-level," Bonta
said, adding that the radiation levels could be as low as the normal
background level of radiation in the environment, to 1 or 2 millirems
above normal background levels.</TE>
<TE>   She and other health department officials said that despite the
judge's ruling, industrial, medical and academic operators of such
facilities continue to seek permission to abandon their sites, and
the state must act on those requests.</TE>
<TE>   However, Sen. Gloria Romero (D-Los Angeles) said she was "shocked"
that the state continues to allow operators to decommission their
sites and dispose of their waste, given the judge's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "Essentially, what they're doing is the same thing the judge said
they should not be doing, but calling it a different name," Romero
said.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're not defying [the ruling], it is pretty close. I was
stunned. They're playing fast and loose with the facts."</TE>
<TE>   Romero accused the department of "deregulating" the dumping of
radioactive waste.</TE>
<TE>   She also criticized the state for adhering to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission standard of 25 millirems, when the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency has recommended tougher restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Romero said she fears such debris is being deposited in the Puente
Hills landfill, which is in her district and is the nation's largest
general dump.</TE>
<TE>   Romero and Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica) are carrying
legislation to restrict dumping and to track where such material is
deposited.</TE>
<TE>   Bonta said the Davis administration may agree to legislation that
would impose a stricter standard.</TE>
<TE>   Three states -- Massachusetts, Maine and New Jersey -- have a
stricter standard.</TE>
<TE>   By agreeing to add a standard by legislation rather than
regulation, the state could avoid having to comply with the judge's
order that it complete an environmental impact report, a process that
could take years.</TE>
<TE>   California has no licensed dump for low-level radioactive waste,
and must ship such material to one of the handful of dumps in other
states.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Hirsch, president of Bridge the Gap, said he is considering
returning to court to force the department to cease decommissioning
such facilities until it follows state law by properly adopting a
regulation.</TE>

<HD>A Production of 'Romeo and Juliet' Calls to Mind Another
Doomed Romance</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Iread where Shakespeare Festival/LA will stage "Romeo and Juliet" in
Pershing Square next month, but I'm not sure I'll attend. For me, the
tragedy would only stir depressing thoughts of another doomed
romance--the one between the San Fernando Valley and the rest of L.A.</LD>
<LD>   Like Romeo, I can only sigh and say: "But, soft! What light
through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Reseda is the sun!"</LD>
<LD>   Unreal estate: Today's showings (see accompanying) include:</LD>
<TE>   * A Newport Beach mansion that seems to refer to some
imperfections in its ad (found by Gerald Scidmore of Corona del Mar).</TE>
<TE>   * And, speaking of imperfections, a house in West Hills that seems
ready to collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Food for thought: The Japanese/English publication L.A. Auto Guide
offered some tips on how to navigate through a meal with chopsticks
(see accompanying)--hopefully not while driving.</TE>
<TE>   I might add I did receive one freeway sighting of a motorist
wielding chopsticks a while back. Wonder if he had a stick shift too.</TE>
<TE>   Annals of strange crimes: The police log of the Huntington Beach
Wave reported: "A resident complained that there were 'loud Foosball
players' in his neighbor's kitchen."</TE>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept: Louise Wilson of Claremont noted that a
new restaurant in her neighborhood advertises "vegetarian shrimp."</TE>
<TE>   Do they shoot from the hip? It's not like the new group, the
Surfing Lawyers Assn., would figure to be popular with the public to
begin with. But, as Paul Daniels of Huntington Beach observes, wait
until the group uses its initials--SLA.</TE>
<TE>   Incidentally, in his e-mail, Daniels said he was from "Huntington
Beach (Surf City--but keep lawyers away)."</TE>
<TE>   Plenty of tails: The Beachwood Canyon Voice, which may have a
shortage of stories to cover, has a feature titled "Doggie Crime
Blotter," with dates and addresses.</TE>
<TE>   I'd recount some of the offenses, but they're all pretty messy.
Suffice it to say: Bad dog, Winston!</TE>
<TE>   Too inspirational? I just got some thank-you notes from my son's
elementary school, where I recently spoke. Feedback is one of the
rewarding parts of such visits. Of course, sometimes the kids can be
unintentionally frank.</TE>
<TE>   I remember when one high school journalism class wrote stories
about my appearance. One student said of me: "For a man who is an
ordinary-looking person, he certainly has had a surprisingly
interesting life." Another noted that I wore a baseball cap "to hide
his bald head."</TE>
<TE>   And a third observed: "Though he's 48, the pressure of the job
makes him look much older." (And that was eight years ago!)</TE>
<TE>   As I read through the thank-you notes from my son's school, one
caught my eye. It came from Eneti Samantha Tagaloa, a fourth-grader.
She said she had "learned a lot from me." She added, "I want to be a
writer that makes people laugh. I'm interested in your job." Thanks
for the warning, Eneti.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: In the name-fits category, Richard Cook says that the
local sales rep for the Anchor Brewing Co. is Bob Brewer. Added Cook:
"In case you're wondering, my own occupation does not involve the
preparation of food." Thanks for cooking up this item, though.</TE>

<HD>Reviving Smallpox Vaccinations Is Opposed</HD>
<DH>Health: Citing risks for those with immune deficiencies,
experts resist a return to mass inoculations to respond to terrorism
potential.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Public health experts argued at a forum Thursday that a return to mass
smallpox vaccinations is ill-advised unless there is an outbreak of the
disease or a confirmed bioterrorism attack using the virus.</LD>
<LD>   A group of epidemiologists charged with helping the federal
government update its vaccination policies said the vaccine carries
so many risks it should be used with restraint.</LD>
<LD>   The comments came at one of four forums the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention is holding across the country to gain
recommendations from health officials and the public about possible
changes in vaccine policy.</LD>
<TE>   Although smallpox was eradicated worldwide in 1977, last year's
anthrax attacks have renewed concern about the virus' use in
bioterrorism. Officials are worried that vials of the virus kept in
storage in the former Soviet Union may have fallen into the hands of
Iraq or North Korea, although no evidence of this has emerged.</TE>
<TE>   Current recommendations call for vaccinating only lab workers and
scientists who work with viruses related to smallpox. Changes under
consideration include making the vaccine available to health care and
emergency workers who would be first to respond if there were an
outbreak, and extending vaccinations on a voluntary basis to the
public.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services expects to
stockpile 286 million doses, enough to protect each resident, by
early 2003. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the
National Vaccine Advisory Committee have been asked to provide an
updated set of smallpox vaccine recommendations to the federal
government by June 20.</TE>
<TE>   One concern among health officials is that the risks of
vaccination are greater than before. If routine vaccines were
reintroduced now, the number of resulting deaths could be as high as
5 for every million adults inoculated--five times the risk in the
1960s.</TE>
<TE>   That is because there are millions more people in the United
States with immune deficiencies than there were at the time mass
vaccinations were discontinued.</TE>
<TE>   Because the vaccine contains a live virus and creates a temporary
lesion on the skin where it is administered, people who receive the
vaccine are potentially able to transmit smallpox symptoms to other
parts of their own bodies and to other people for about 10 days after
receiving the vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   If the symptoms are passed on to people with immune deficiencies,
including those who are infected with the human immunodeficiency
virus and patients who have undergone chemotherapy or organ
transplants, that threat is particularly grave, health experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's just no way to guide us in terms of any previous
experience. Those are the dilemmas," said Dr. Hal Margolis, senior
advisor to the director for Smallpox Planning and Response at the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control.</TE>
<TE>   About 11,000 lab workers and scientists have been vaccinated in
the U.S. since 1983.</TE>
<TE>   The nation stopped vaccinating children for the disease in 1972
because the likelihood of complications, even death, from the vaccine
was considered a greater threat than the disease.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the primary strategy for containing smallpox is to
isolate those infected and selectively vaccinate those around them,
forming a protective "ring."</TE>
<TE>   The vaccine is considered effective in preventing and reducing the
severity of the disease, even if it is administered shortly after a
person is exposed to smallpox.</TE>
<TE>   "If we have the infrastructure in place, then we can measure the
risks" for each individual before administering the vaccine, said Dr.
Ann Margaret Arvin, a member of the immunization practices advisory
committee and professor of pediatrics and infectious disease at
Stanford University Medical School. "By and large, what I've heard
today is that people want to take a measured approach."</TE>
<TE>   Were it not for the potential of terrorist attack--which officials
consider low--the risks of the vaccine would continue to outweigh its
benefits, experts said.</TE>

<HD>Dee Dee Ramone, 49; One of Punk Rock's Pioneers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dee Dee Ramone, a founding member of the seminal punk rock band the
Ramones, was found dead at his Hollywood home late Wednesday. He was
49.</LD>
<LD>   Ramone was found on a couch by his wife when she returned home at
8:25 p.m., a spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner told
Associated Press. Paramedics were called and he was declared dead at
8:40 p.m. Investigators found drug paraphernalia at the scene.</LD>
<LD>   The coroner's spokesman told The Times that the preliminary
listing for the case was "apparent accidental overdose" of drugs, but
that an official determination of the cause of death would not be
made until toxicology tests were completed, which can take four to
six weeks.</LD>
<TE>   His death comes 14 months after the Ramones' most famous member,
singer Joey Ramone, died of cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Dee Dee Ramone was a key contributor to the band that is generally
acknowledged as the originator of punk rock. The fast-paced sound
brought energy and rawness to a mid-'70s pop music world dominated by
slick disco and faceless "corporate rock."</TE>
<TE>   Although punk began as an underground movement, it soon became a
staple of rock, spawning such bands as the Sex Pistols and the Clash.</TE>
<TE>   It remains a vital--and much more commercial--force today, with
such best-selling acts as Green Day, the Offspring and Blink-182
representing succeeding generations.</TE>
<TE>   The Ramones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in
March, and a tribute album of the group's songs recorded by such
artists as Eddie Vedder, Marilyn Manson and the Red Hot Chili Peppers
will be released by Columbia Records later this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Dee Dee was the epitome of what punk rock was all about," the
Ramones' longtime manager Gary Kurfirst said. "He lived it; he lived
dangerously."</TE>
<TE>   Born Douglas Colvin in Virginia, Dee Dee Ramone spent much of his
youth in West Germany, where his father was stationed in the Army.</TE>
<TE>   He was living in Queens, N.Y., when he formed a band with friends
Jeff Hyman, John Cummings and Tom Erdelyi. After some
instrument-switching and the adoption of a common surname, bassist
Dee Dee, singer Joey, guitarist Johnny and drummer Tommy Ramone
became a sensation on a burgeoning New York scene that also fostered
the Talking Heads, Patti Smith and Blondie.</TE>
<TE>   Dee Dee was a key contributor to the Ramones, co-writing the
satirical anthem "Teenage Lobotomy," the rousing "Rockaway Beach" and
the movie theme song "Pet Sematary," among his many credits. Every
number in the group's show began with his shout of 1-2-3-4.</TE>
<TE>   Dee Dee left the band, which continued until 1996, in 1989. He
recorded a rap album under the name Dee Dee King, then returned to
rock for three records. He toured with his wife, Barbara Zampini, and
two later Ramones members under the name the Remainz, mainly playing
the old band's songs.</TE>
<TE>   Dee Dee also turned to painting and writing, publishing an
autobiography, "Poison Heart: Surviving the Ramones," and a novel,
"Chelsea Horror Hotel." Another novel, "Legend of a Rock Star," is
scheduled to be published this month.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an amazing person," his book publisher Neil Ortenberg said
Thursday. "He could be so otherworldly that people would disregard
him, then he'd suddenly say something that would make you realize
what kind of genius he was."</TE>
<TE>   Ramone was a participant in The Times Book Festival in April, and
performed the following week at the Knitting Factory, a Hollywood
nightclub.</TE>
<TE>   In his first book and in interviews, the musician frequently spoke
about his struggles with drugs and other problems. He said that he
went broke, was jailed on assault charges and arrested for drugs. But
he professed to have kicked his habit in the early '90s.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really lucky I'm still around," he said in an interview in
late 2000. "Everybody expected me to die next.... It was sad when Sid
Vicious died.... I was freaked out when Phil Lynott died from Thin
Lizzy. I cried. It was too crazy. But it was always someone else
instead of me."</TE>
<TE>   Ramone is survived by his wife, his mother and a sister.</TE>

<HD>Ayn Rand Institute to Move to Orange County</HD>
<DH>Think tanks: The laissez-faire researchers seek more
room--and a friendlier philosophical environment--outside Marina del
Rey.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ayn Rand Institute, bastion of capitalist thinking and a champion
of individual rights, is moving to Orange County as it looks for a
more comfortable fit physically and philosophically.</LD>
<LD>   Its beachfront office in Marina del Rey has become too cramped for
its 29 staff members and proved too brutal a commute for its
president and executive director, Yaron Brook.</LD>
<LD>   So Brook will relocate the think tank to Irvine, which he believes
is better suited to Rand's objectivist philosophy that favors small
government and more private enterprise--and where there's room to
double the center's space and work on increasing its $3-million
budget.</LD>
<TE>   "My sense of Irvine is that it's a safe, clean-cut environment
where everything is new, ... the streets are wide open and clean, and
the neighborhoods are close to shopping centers. It's just a nice
place to live and raise my family," said Brook, who has commuted to
work for two years from Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   The move takes place June 30, when the institute's current lease
expires.</TE>
<TE>   The new two-story, 12,500-square-foot, glass building in a
business complex on Alton Parkway suits the institute and Brook
nicely.</TE>
<TE>   So does Orange County's reputation for being pro-business and
anti-big government, both espoused by novelist and philosopher Ayn
Rand.</TE>
<TE>   The institute, funded by private and corporate donations, conducts
social and political research and publishes papers promoting Rand's
theories.</TE>
<TE>   "We know Orange County is a little more politically conservative,"
Brook said. "But I don't think any geographic community is completely
in sync with the philosophy of the Rand Institute. But we're working
on it."</TE>
<TE>   Rand preached that individuals, rather than the government, are
fundamental to creating a well-functioning society.</TE>
<TE>   A fervent atheist and capitalist, Rand believed that the highest
goal for individuals is happiness and that the only way to attain it
is through the use of reason, not religion or emotion.</TE>
<TE>   In her books "The Fountainhead" and "Atlas Shrugged," she promoted
individual rights and laissez-faire capitalism.</TE>
<TE>   "We've managed to upset Democrats, Republicans, the Green Party,
liberals and conservatives. I mean, atheist capitalist--it doesn't
get more radical than that," Brook said.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think many in Orange County may share our economic ideas,
but on religion and social policy, many will challenge us."</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Peikoff, who founded the Rand Institute in 1985, has lived
in Irvine for 10 years and said he supports the move.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good intellectual environment; it's more congenial,"
Peikoff said. "It's more conducive to a pro-capitalist philosophy
down here in Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   Some say the move indicates Orange County's coming of age.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not surprising that we're headquarters to all manners of
enterprises, including think tanks," said Rep. Christopher Cox
(R-Newport Beach).</TE>
<TE>   The institute has often held opinions that run counter to popular
sentiment. During last year's energy crisis, Brook blasted the
state's call for energy conservation. The institute also lobbied in
favor of Microsoft and Bill Gates in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "They're an institute engaged in research and public education.
I'm happy they would find a home in Irvine," said Mayor Larry Agran.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that their philosophy is not my cup of tea isn't
important. Irvine is home to a wide range of intellectuals, and so
why shouldn't there be diversity of thought?"</TE>

<HD>Woman Charged in Park Assaults</HD>
<DH>Court: Mission Viejo 21-year-old faces 18 counts, including
attempted child abuse, in connection with planting sharp objects.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors on Thursday charged a 21-year-old Mission Viejo woman
with planting razor blades and nails at nine parks, saying the 10th
incident was probably the work of a copycat.</LD>
<LD>   Lori Elizabeth Fischer faces 18 counts of assault with a deadly
weapon and attempted child abuse for allegedly planting sharp objects
in slides and burying them in sand over the last two months. The
incidents prompted deputies to routinely search all south Orange
County parks with metal detectors.</LD>
<LD>   Fischer was arrested Tuesday at Vista del Lago Park in Mission
Viejo after police watched her enter the park and leave seven minutes
later. Police, who had searched the park two hours earlier,
discovered nails at the playground.</LD>
<TE>   Thursday authorities released a tape of her arrest that showed
that she kept holding the steering wheel and refused to come out of
her car after police pulled her over.</TE>
<TE>   After a 30-minute standoff, police with guns drawn smashed the
rear windows of her car and pulled her out.</TE>
<TE>   During her first court appearance in South Justice Center in
Laguna Niguel, Fischer replied softly to the judge in one-word
answers and kept her head bowed throughout the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Carl Biggs continued her arraignment until June 21 but kept
her bail at $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, Fischer faces up to 12 years in prison.</TE>

<HD>State Renews Energy Conservation Rebates</HD>

<LD>State regulators voted Thursday to renew a successful energy
conservation program that provides utility customers with a 20%
reduction in their electricity bills if they trim their consumption
by the same percentage.</LD>
<LD>   At the request of Gov. Gray Davis, the California Public Utilities
Commission unanimously adopted a new version of the 20/20 program,
which state officials credit with helping stave off rolling blackouts
last summer. This year's program will run from July through October
in the service territories of Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas
&amp; Electric Co. and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric.</LD>
<LD>   There are some changes in the new program. It will apply this year
only to residential customers, not commercial and industrial
customers.</LD>
<TE>   Monthly energy consumption will be compared with the same month in
2000, rather than 2001. By using consumption from 2000, officials
said, customers who reduced usage last year will not be penalized.
New customers and those who have moved will have their consumption
compared with the average in their area.</TE>
<TE>   Customers who reduce their consumption during a given month will
receive a credit on their next monthly bill. Utilities plan to start
notifying people about the program through bill inserts and
advertising this month.</TE>
<TE>   The program is financed by the state Department of Water
Resources, which began buying some power last year when utilities got
into financial trouble.</TE>
<TE>   About one-third of Edison's customers received rebates last summer
amounting to $62 million. Officials project that the program will
yield similar or greater electricity savings this year.</TE>
<TE>   Edison spokesman Gil Alexander said there is some concern that
consumers might relax their conservation efforts because of news
reports that the energy crisis has eased and the state projects
adequate electricity supplies this summer. But, he added, "We believe
they will continue to conserve."</TE>
<TE>   There will be automatic energy savings, Alexander said, because
many customers have improved the efficiency of their appliances,
heating and lighting.</TE>
<TE>   Last year the utility sent out more than 70,000 rebate checks
totaling $8.9 million to customers who replaced older, energy-wasting
refrigerators and made other energy improvements.</TE>

vote by residents in parts of Goleta, Isla Vista, the Santa Ynez
Valley and Vandenberg Village.</LD>
<LD>   The recall effort began last fall when Marshall's critics said she

<HD>Hahn Stumps for L.A. in Hollywood</HD>
<DH>Campaign: The mayor takes his anti-secession message to the
public, with an exuberant Councilman LaBonge cheering him on.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after Hollywood secession made the November ballot, Los Angeles
Mayor James K. Hahn embarked on an uncharacteristic morning of
hand-to-hand politicking Thursday, pressing the flesh in the
entertainment capital and making his case for keeping the city
together.</LD>
<LD>   Prodded by Councilman Tom LaBonge, an exuberant politician of the
old style, Hahn introduced himself to passersby, and even accepted a
lei from an actress dressed as a hula girl in front of the El Capitan
Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   The day started at the Hollywood Entertainment Museum as Hahn and
Councilman Eric Garcetti unveiled a brochure for a new walking tour
of Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   "Hollywood is a great community," Hahn said. "It's more than just
the home of the entertainment industry. It is home to great
neighborhoods and great businesses. On my way in, I saw throngs of
tourists coming to visit Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   As the mayor posed for pictures, LaBonge, who represents part of
Hollywood, bounded into the room wearing a bright yellow T-shirt
("They're just five bucks on the corner there") that he'd bought on
the way in.</TE>
<TE>   Out on the sidewalk on the way to Hahn's next event, the repair of
a Walk of Fame star honoring 94-year-old Penny Singleton, who played
the comics character Blondie in films from 1938 to 1950, it was
LaBonge who made sure that the mayor got noticed.</TE>
<TE>   "LADEEZ AND GENTLEMEN," the councilman boomed. "Let me introduce
you to the great mayor of Los Angeles! The great Mayor Jim Hahn!"</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge introduced himself to Ken Bedwell, who was visiting from
Yorkshire, England. "Would you like to meet the mayor of Los
Angeles?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn shook Bedwell's hand vigorously. "It's not every day you meet
a mayor," the Englishman said later.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn made his way down the street, shaking hands as LaBonge
funneled tourists and neighborhood activists toward him for pictures
and a greeting.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, the mayor climbed onto a sightseeing bus and
introduced himself to everyone on board.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm Jim Hahn," he told them. "I'm the mayor of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   David Hunt, who drives the bus for Starlight Tours, said he
understands the frustrations of people who favor breaking Hollywood
and the San Fernando Valley away from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "They pay their taxes and they're not getting their fair share of
services," he said. "But that should be worked out within the city."</TE>
<TE>   Back on the street, Hahn put his hand out to greet a passerby, but
his introduction was interrupted by a shout from LaBonge.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's hear it for the 217 bus!" the councilman cried. "On time!
Bringing people to Hollywood--in the great city of Los Angeles."</TE>

<HD>John Sinkankas, 87; Authority on Gems, Minerals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Sinkankas, an internationally renowned mineralogist, gemologist,
lapidary and author-illustrator whose books on gems and minerals are
considered classics in the field, has died. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Sinkankas, who had been in declining health due to heart, lung and
back problems, died May 17 at Scripps Green Hospital in La Jolla.</LD>
<LD>   "Since George F. Kunz of Tiffany fame at the turn of the last
century, he's probably the most renowned mineralogist, mineral author
and gemologist there is," said Bill Larson, owner of Pala
International, a Fallbrook company that mines and sells gems. "People
of their magnitude come along once in a hundred years."</LD>
<TE>   A 25-year Navy aviator, Sinkankas was already well known in the
field of mineral sciences when he retired from the military as a
captain in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   A self-trained lapidary who started cutting gems in 1947, he began
writing a lapidary column for Rocks and Minerals magazine in 1951.
Four years later, the first of his 15 books, "Gem Cutting: A
Lapidary's Manual," was published.</TE>
<TE>   The 1959 publication of his "Gemstones of North America"
established Sinkankas' reputation as a leading authority on gems. He
illustrated his books with watercolors of gem crystals, illustrations
that are known for their beauty and technical accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   "John was a true Renaissance man because of the way he could do an
exquisite watercolor and then write something as scientific and as
well researched as 'Emerald and Other Beryls,' one of his standards,"
said Larson, a longtime friend.</TE>
<TE>   As a gem cutter, Sinkankas excelled in faceting exceptionally
large gems. To do so, he designed a faceting machine that was twice
the size of a conventional machine.</TE>
<TE>   Three of his large faceted gemstones--a 7,000-carat rock crystal
egg, a 4,500-carat smoky quartz egg and a 2,054-carat golden
beryl--are on display in the Smithsonian Institution's Natural
History Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Sinkankas was also his field's best-known bibliophile.</TE>
<TE>   To write his columns on gem cutting, he amassed over 40 years what
is considered the leading gemological library in the world: About
10,000 books (the oldest dating to 1511) and 4,000 pamphlets,
newspaper and magazine clippings.</TE>
<TE>   A second-generation Lithuanian who spoke Lithuanian and German, he
also learned to read Italian, French and Russian so he could read
some of the foreign books he bought for his library. And faced with
defective bindings, he learned the art of bookbinding.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, Sinkankas sold his book collection to the Gemological
Institute of America in Carlsbad, where it forms the core of the
institute's rare book collection.</TE>
<TE>   As his personal library grew in the early 1970s, Sinkankas and his
wife, Marjorie, started Peri Lithon--the Greek translation of "about
stones"--a company that specializes in rare and antique earth science
books.</TE>
<TE>   Sinkankas' book collection also led him to write "Gemology: An
Annotated Bibliography," published in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the foremost work on gemology," said Dona Dirlam, director
of the Gemological Institute of America's Richard T. Liddicoat
Library and Information Center.</TE>
<TE>   Dirlam said Sinkankas' engaging personality and voice come through
even in the bibliography. "Many bibliographies are quite dry, but his
bibliography comes alive because of the stories he tells you about
the author or the information that's in the book and he didn't
hesitate to be critical when that was needed," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Paterson, N.J., in 1915, Sinkankas developed an interest
in minerals in grade school when he began exploring quarries and
collecting minerals near his home.</TE>
<TE>   A 1936 graduate of the New Jersey State Teachers College in
Paterson, where he met his wife, Sinkankas decided to pursue another
early interest after graduation: aviation. He joined the Navy and
graduated as a naval aviation cadet from the Naval Air Station in
Pensacola, Fla., in 1937.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, he served as a flight instructor and flew
reconnaissance missions in a seaplane patrol squadron.</TE>
<TE>   While stationed in San Diego in the 1950s, he began combining his
off-duty writing with mining gems in San Diego County as an amateur.</TE>
<TE>   Sinkankas, who wrote for most mineral and gem publications over
the years, continued a monthly column for Rock and Gem magazine until
his death.</TE>
<TE>   Among his many awards and honors: In 1984, a new phosphate mineral
was named sinkankasite in honor of his contributions to the field.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Marjorie, of Pacific Beach; daughters
Sharon Tooley of San Diego and Marjorie Coates of Troutville, Va.;
sons John, of Los Angeles, and George, of Knoxville, Tenn.; a
brother, William, of Oklahoma City; nine grandchildren; and six
great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held at 4 p.m. June 29 at the
Gemological Institute of America. The family asks that donations in
Sinkankas' memory be made to the Richard T. Liddicoat Gemological
Library at the gemological institute, attention Dona Dirlam, 5345
Armada Drive, Carlsbad, CA, 92008</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tibor Scitovsky, an economist who influenced global trade and
economic development policies and helped build Stanford University's
economics department, has died. He was 91.</LD>
<LD>   Scitovsky died Saturday at Stanford Hospital from complications
after surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Budapest, he was from a prominent Hungarian family. His
father was the president of one of Hungary's largest banks and later
served as foreign minister.</LD>
<TE>   Scitovsky earned degrees at the University of Budapest, Cambridge
University's Trinity College in England and the London School of
Economics before arriving in the United States in 1939.</TE>
<TE>   He served in the U.S. Army from 1943 to 1946, first driving a
truck in England, then working for the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey,
which studied the effects of bombing on Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Early in his academic career, Scitovsky focused on the theory of
international trade and welfare economics. He gained a reputation as
an unorthodox social critic in the 1970s, when he published "The
Joyless Economy: An Inquiry Into Human Satisfaction and Consumer
Dissatisfaction."</TE>
<TE>   He argued that the American economy overemphasized comfort and
safety and deprived consumers of the joys of challenging, unexpected
and even risky activities--a concept initially received with
skepticism by his colleagues. By 1995, however, the Times Literary
Supplement of London had rated the work among the 100 most
influential books of the post-World War II era.</TE>
<TE>   Scitovsky was recruited by Stanford after the war and remained
there until 1958, becoming one of the key figures in the university's
budding economics department, said professor emeritus Mel Reder, a
longtime colleague and friend.</TE>
<TE>   Scitovsky went on to teach at UC Berkeley, Harvard and Yale, then
returned to Stanford in 1970 and stayed there until his retirement in
1976. He later taught at UC Santa Cruz. Through the 1990s, he
continued to publish articles on economics.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 33 years, Elisabeth, and a daughter,
Catherine Eliaser, from his first marriage.</TE>

<HD>Man Is Shot at TRW</HD>
<DH>Violence: Police arrest employee at Redondo Beach site.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A man was shot in the face by a TRW employee Thursday morning in a
company parking lot in Redondo Beach, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Angel Colon, 39, of Torrance was arrested on suspicion of
attempted murder after allegedly shooting Jose Solis, 46, of
Hawthorne during an altercation. Colon is a programmer at the
aerospace and defense firm.</LD>
<LD>   Solis and Colon had had an ongoing argument over whether Colon was
having a relationship with Solis' wife, who also works at TRW,
officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Colon was returning from a meeting at 10:20 a.m. when Solis
surprised him in the parking lot, officials said. The men began to
argue and Colon pulled out a "large caliber" handgun and fired one
shot that hit Solis in the mouth, said Redondo Beach Det. Don Baird.</TE>
<TE>   TRW security guards detained Colon in the lot on the northeast
corner of the complex at 1 Space Park Drive until police arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Solis was taken to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center near Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   "He sustained serious injuries, but he's expected to recover,"
Baird said.</TE>
<TE>   Colon is being held at the Redondo Beach Police Department
awaiting arraignment.</TE>

<HD>Vegan Inmate Who Refused Meals Is Given Home Arrest</HD>
<DH>Jail: Vegetarian alleges mistreatment. Officials say only
that she qualified for switch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 26-year-old vegan who refused to eat jail meals while incarcerated
for her participation in a May Day clash with Long Beach police last
year has been released to home arrest.</LD>
<LD>   Sarah Roberts of Los Angeles said she subsisted mostly on fruit
and lettuce during her 10-day stay in the mental ward of Twin Towers
Correctional Facility in downtown Los Angeles and was "skeletal" by
the time jail officials released her May 31.</LD>
<LD>   Roberts, a model and aspiring actress, said she believes jail
officials let her go because they did not want to deal with her
dietary needs. Sheriff's officials said only that Roberts, who had
been sentenced to six months in jail, had qualified for release under
a home-arrest program that she had applied for.</LD>
<TE>   Roberts said she told Long Beach Superior Court Judge Bradford
Andrews at her sentencing last month that she would have trouble
serving a jail term because of her stance against eating meat and
animal byproducts, such as milk and cheese.</TE>
<TE>   "He suggested I stop eating vegan," Roberts said. "I explained to
him that ... to me, animals aren't food. They're dead bodies. My
ethics command me not to eat them."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts said she was vocal in jail about her dietary needs, but
was served bologna sandwiches and other meat products, as well as
cookies and fruit.</TE>
<TE>   She said she eventually got peanut butter, iceberg lettuce and,
occasionally, white rice to supplement her fruit diet, but jail staff
also continued to give her milk or oatmeal with butter.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't tell whether they were trying to torture me or if they
just couldn't grasp the concept" of veganism, Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Lt. Alma Espinoza, a watch commander at the jail, said
efforts were made to accommodate Roberts, who was housed in the
mental ward because of depression.</TE>
<TE>   "We just got a general understanding about what she could or
couldn't eat, and we went from there," Espinoza said, adding that the
jail serves special meals to inmates with health problems and a small
number of nonvegan vegetarians.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts was convicted by a jury May 21 of unlawful assembly and
wearing a mask while in commission of a public offense, her lawyer
said.</TE>
<TE>   She maintains she was merely a spectator at the demonstration in
Long Beach and put on a ski mask to protect her face from police tear
gas.</TE>
<TE>   More than 63 people pleaded guilty or were convicted of charges
stemming from the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts said she is considering suing the Sheriff's Department,
which runs the jail.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely don't want this to happen to someone else," she
said.</TE>

<LD>Archeologists have unearthed six 3,500-year-old tombs that they
believe reveal important details about the structure of government in
a period considered Egypt's golden age, said Zahi Hawass, the
nation's top archeologist.</LD>
<LD>   This week, archeologists working on a dig just outside Cairo found
the tombs at the foot of the third dynasty Step Pyramid.</LD>
<LD>   The tombs belonged to government officials who worked in northern
Egypt at the end of the 18th dynasty and early 19th dynasty
(1567-1200 BC), when the seat of power was in southern Egypt and not
near Cairo, which is in the north.</LD>

<LD>Incumbent Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern was reappointed as head
of the government and said securing lasting peace in neighboring
Northern Ireland was his top priority. He also pledged to keep the
economy booming.</LD>
<LD>   An election May 17 strengthened both Ahern's Fianna Fail party and
its smaller partner, the Progressive Democrats. His is the first
administration to retain power in Ireland in 33 years.</LD>
<LD>   The prime minister said keeping alive the Good Friday peace pact
in British-ruled Northern Ireland would be his "great political
goal." Ahern helped negotiate the 1998 accord.</LD>

<LD>   The Federal Shariat Court ordered Zafran Bibi, 28, released after
her husband, Niamat Khan, said a girl born to her was his child.</LD>
<LD>   A judge in the northwestern city of Kohat convicted Bibi of
adultery last month and sentenced her to death after the girl was
born to her while Khan, convicted in a murder case, was in jail.</LD>

<HD>India Seeks U.S. Check of Camps on Pakistani Soil</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Verification of suspect sites' closure is seen as
key to ending militants' infiltration.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>Insisting that separatist fighters continue to cross into Kashmir,
India has quietly asked the U.S. to help settle the debate by
inspecting suspected terrorist camps in Pakistani-held territory.</LD>
<LD>   "In a very informal sense, we have conveyed to the Americans that
if they verify the camps are closed, we are going to believe them," a
senior Indian intelligence officer said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistan insists that there are no terrorist camps in areas under
its control and that infiltrations into Jammu and Kashmir state, the
portion of Kashmir held by India, have stopped.</LD>
<TE>   The Pakistani government says it gives political and moral support
to a broad range of groups it considers home-grown freedom fighters
operating in the region.</TE>
<TE>   But India is equally adamant in its claim that Pakistan continues
to support "cross-border terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Deciding who is right and ensuring that Pakistan shuts down
suspected militant training camps and infiltration routes are key to
defusing the confrontation between the nuclear-armed neighbors, which
have deployed 1 million troops along their border.</TE>
<TE>   The intelligence official's comments Thursday reflect the Indian
government's frustration over what it sees as Washington's failure to
make Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf cooperate completely in the
war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   With FBI and CIA agents and U.S. Special Forces troops already
hunting for Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters in Pakistan, it would be
logical to visit training camps that Indian intelligence has
identified, the intelligence officer argued.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, this is terrorism. And there can never be half a campaign
against terrorism," he added. "It must be complete. Only then will it
be effective."</TE>
<TE>   New Delhi has long maintained that, because Pakistan was a close
U.S. ally, Washington failed to heed Indian warnings that previous
Pakistani governments were turning South Asia into a breeding ground
for international terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   India sees the same mistakes being repeated, with Musharraf aiding
the U.S. search for primarily foreign terrorism suspects while
Pakistani extremists are either released after brief detentions or
held in comfortable government rest houses.</TE>
<TE>   To support the claim of Pakistani duplicity in the war against
terrorism, a second Indian intelligence source provided detailed
descriptions of what he said are training camps run by three militant
groups.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage will receive
similar details, and a map locating the suspected camps, during his
talks in New Delhi today, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the camps that India believes is still operating belongs to
Jaish-e-Mohammed, a terrorist group accused of involvement in the
murder-kidnapping of American journalist Daniel Pearl in January. Its
leader, Maulana Masood Azhar, has suspected links with Al Qaeda
dating to the 1993 Mogadishu street war that drove U.S. troops from
Somalia.</TE>
<TE>   The main Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp was set up in June 2000
near the Pakistani town of Balakot, in the unruly Northwest Frontier
Province, according to the second source.</TE>
<TE>   When India and Pakistan were on the brink of war in January,
Musharraf banned the organization along with four others under
international pressure. India says Jaish-e-Mohammed was involved in
the December 2001 terrorist attack on its Parliament, in which 14
people were killed, including five attackers.</TE>
<TE>   Indian intelligence claims that the group's Balakot camp "has now
been transformed into a huge complex, comprising a number of concrete
buildings, which include a residential block, a kitchen, guest house,
medical dispensary and mosque. It is protected by 400 to 500 security
guards."</TE>
<TE>   The second intelligence source claimed that the camp is under the
command of a man named Yousuf, who married Azhar's sister.</TE>
<TE>   The source said 1,000 fighters are undergoing training at the
camp, and claimed that Jaish-e-Mohammed has at least two other
functioning camps in Sargodha, in northern Punjab province, and
Mansehra, in Northwest Frontier Province.</TE>
<TE>   India's civilian and military spy agencies have identified at
least 20 training camps, and an additional 11 camps that they say
guerrillas use as launching sites for attacks inside Jammu and
Kashmir state and elsewhere in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The camps have been pinpointed by various sources, including
captured fighters, satellite reconnaissance and radio intercepts, the
senior intelligence officer said.</TE>
<TE>   India believes that a second group with close ties to
Afghanistan's former Taliban regime has established training camps in
the approximately one-third of Kashmir under Pakistan's control.</TE>
<TE>   The extremist Islamic militia is called Harkat-ul-Jihad-i-Islami,
and its Pakistani leader, Qari Saifullah Akhtar, was an advisor to
Mullah Mohammed Omar, the Taliban's supreme leader.</TE>
<TE>   Akhtar's group has been named as a possible suspect in the May 8
suicide bombing that killed 11 Frenchmen outside the Sheraton Hotel
and Towers in Karachi, Pakistan's commercial hub.</TE>
<TE>   The Harkat-ul-Jihad-i-Islami has a jungle training camp near the
village of Phagosh, about 2.5 miles from Kotli on the road to
Khuiratta, in Pakistan-held Kashmir, according to Indian
intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   There are 15 tents in the camp, including two outside as
observation posts, claimed the second intelligence source, who said
each tent can hold 15 to 20 people.</TE>
<TE>   There is also a mosque in the center of the camp, six bathrooms, a
bunker and open areas for military training, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Al Badr, a third militia that also has suspected links to Al
Qaeda, provides one-month basic training to its fighters in at least
two camps at Mansehra, in the Ougee Hills, and Kotli, the Indian
intelligence official said.</TE>
<TE>   Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes also says militants
continue to cross into Indian-controlled areas from Pakistan, but the
two intelligence sources agreed that it will take several weeks to
determine whether Musharraf has stopped the infiltrations.</TE>
<TE>   That is because it usually takes a month for fighters operating in
groups of three or four to leave a training camp, wait at a much
smaller "launch site," and then try to cross into Indian territory,
the senior intelligence officer said.</TE>
<TE>   Once they reach the staging points, they are out of radio contact
to prevent detection through Indian eavesdropping, he added, so they
wouldn't be able to receive any new orders.</TE>
<TE>   But that wouldn't explain how anyone still crossing from
Pakistani-held territory can manage to get through heavily mined
areas, along what is now one of the world's most heavily fortified
front lines, without help from the Pakistan military.</TE>
<TE>   The senior Indian intelligence officer dismissed suggestions that
the U.S. might ease his government's fears of infiltrations by
providing high-tech monitoring gear.</TE>
<TE>   The mountainous routes are simply too forested and rugged for
electronic detectors to work well, he argued.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like wildlife photography, where you get everything you
want with a few cameras," he said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Envoy Upbeat After Talks</HD>
<DH>South Asia: Buoyed by Pakistan's assurance that it won't
initiate war, Richard Armitage says he'll be looking to India for a
similar promise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>After meeting with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf for nearly
two hours, a senior American envoy said Thursday that he was
heartened about the prospects for defusing the crisis that has
brought this nation and neighboring India to the verge of war.</LD>
<LD>   "President Musharraf has made it very clear he's searching for
peace, that he won't be the one to initiate war, and I'll be looking
hopefully for the same kind of assurances tomorrow in New Delhi,"
Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage told reporters here. "I
think that's a very good basis on which to proceed."</LD>
<LD>   A senior Pakistani official close to Musharraf also was upbeat,
describing the talks as "a very positive exchange of ideas."</LD>
<TE>   Armitage made his comments on the first day of a brief trip to
troubled South Asia. The visit is the latest in a series of
international diplomatic efforts aimed at heading off the possibility
of military conflict between two nuclear-armed nations that have
fought three wars during the last 55 years.</TE>
<TE>   Armitage is scheduled to fly early today to New Delhi to consult
with Indian leaders. On the eve of Armitage's mission, President Bush
urged Musharraf and Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee in
telephone calls to intensify efforts to find a peaceful way out of
the crisis over the disputed Kashmir region.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Bush
spoke by telephone for about 20 minutes Thursday with Russian
President Vladimir V. Putin about several issues, including the
India-Pakistan dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said the two agreed in their call "to continue mutual
efforts to de-escalate tensions between India and Pakistan."</TE>
<TE>   The United States has an important stake in reducing tensions. In
addition to the enormous dangers inherent in an armed conflict
between nuclear powers, a war on the subcontinent would be a serious
blow to the American-led struggle against international terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forces based in Pakistan provide crucial support for the
fight to crush the remnants of the Al Qaeda terrorist network,
believed to have taken sanctuary on both sides of the
Afghan-Pakistani border. In addition, Pakistan has pulled some troops
away from the search there for Al Qaeda units and redeployed them
along the eastern border with India.</TE>
<TE>   Armitage's visit came on a day when fighting on the tense frontier
in Kashmir reportedly claimed at least 13 lives--seven in armed
attacks on the Indian side and six on the Pakistani side, apparently
from Indian army artillery shelling. The British and U.S. governments
issued new warnings Wednesday urging their citizens to leave the
subcontinent.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani sources said Armitage presented no specific peace plan
to Musharraf and other senior officials here but was instead
searching for ways to coax the South Asian nations to step back from
the edge of open hostilities and to agree on confidence-building
measures that could reduce tensions.</TE>
<TE>   It is a politically delicate task.</TE>
<TE>   About 1 million Indian and Pakistani troops are massed along their
border amid tensions over Kashmir, a Muslim-majority territory
claimed by both nations and divided between them by the so-called
Line of Control. The current crisis was triggered by attacks in the
Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir that were carried out by Islamic
militant groups. New Delhi claims that the attackers trained in
Pakistan and then crossed over into Indian-held Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   India has refused to engage in direct talks with Pakistan to end
the crisis until it is satisfied that Musharraf has halted the
incursions of militants across the frontier. Pakistani officials
insist that the infiltration has stopped and that recent terrorist
acts in the Indian-controlled territory were carried out by groups
based there.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Armitage appeared to accept similar assurances given
by Musharraf.</TE>
<TE>   "The president of Pakistan has made it very clear that nothing is
happening across the Line of Control," he said. "We're looking for
that to hold over the longer run."</TE>
<TE>   Armitage is expected to try to use those assurances during
meetings in New Delhi to nudge India toward de-escalatory measures.</TE>
<TE>   Vajpayee appeared to be moving in that direction Wednesday when he
proposed joint Indian-Pakistani military patrols along the Line of
Control, but even that proposal quickly fizzled in both countries.</TE>
<TE>   First, Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmed Khan
dismissed the idea as unworkable in the current climate of mistrust.
Then Vajpayee's defense minister, George Fernandes, said Thursday
that he believed there was "no likelihood" of joint patrols.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said it was unclear how long Armitage will stay in
New Delhi, but it appeared likely that he will depart during the
weekend.</TE>

<HD>Arafat Surveys All That's Left of His Compound</HD>
<DH>West Bank: Residents of Ramallah crowd the site to view the
damage by Israeli forces, who also targeted the Palestinian leader's
private quarters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Once the explosions fell silent and the Israeli tanks crunched out of
his flattened compound Thursday morning, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat paced the rooms that remained. Pale dust coated his prayer rug
and coverlet; the mirror over his dresser was splintered; a crack ran
across a framed snapshot of his daughter.</LD>
<LD>   This broken island of rooms--two buildings precariously linked by
a cracked walkway--is all that remains of Arafat's vast, walled
headquarters compound here. Armed with tanks, dynamite and
bulldozers, Israeli soldiers retaliated for the latest Palestinian
suicide bombing by wasting his complex with stunning speed in the
small hours of the morning.</LD>
<LD>   Sunrise uncovered a landscape of cement skeletons: beams twisted
like paper; building facades shaved clean off.</LD>
<TE>   Two Palestinians died in the assault, medical officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "This aggression against the headquarters of the Palestinian
people, what is the meaning of it? They are trying to say they can
defeat us," Arafat told reporters. "No one can defeat the Palestinian
people. We are steadfast, steadfast, steadfast."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, the Palestinian Authority president's private
quarters were shelled. His bathroom tiles shattered when a shot from
an Israeli tank blasted through the wall a few feet from his double
bed. He was not in his quarters at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat said the shell was meant to kill him--a claim that Israeli
officials denied.</TE>
<TE>   The predawn onslaught came as a furious Israel prepared to bury 13
soldiers and four civilians killed Wednesday by a Palestinian suicide
bomber, identified by Islamic Jihad as Hamza Samudi, 17. In a land
where politics and warfare are played out with a heavy dash of
theater, the ruin at Arafat's doorstep was a reminder that the Jewish
state could strike at any time. It was a show of might, a strict
warning--and humiliating evidence of Arafat's vulnerability.</TE>
<TE>   "We are sending a very clear message that there will be no
impunity and no sanctuary," said Raanan Gissin, a spokesman for
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   The tanks and soldiers roared through the streets of Ramallah
about 2 a.m., battled their way past Arafat's guards and unleashed a
three-hour barrage of shells and heavy-caliber machine-gun fire.
Next, they blew up buildings with dynamite and plowed the rubble to
dust with armored bulldozers.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers rumbled off again after sunrise, leaving a smoking
landscape of wreckage. Buildings that dated to the pre-1948 British
mandate era were crushed. Mountains of crumbled stone and rivers of
white dust were the only remains of the presidential guard office,
the military intelligence headquarters and the jail. The Ramallah
governor's office, barracks and a garage were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said the demolition
was a reminder that the Jewish state holds the Palestinian Authority
president personally responsible for the continuing suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot turn a blind eye to these terror attacks," he said.
"The security forces and the [Israeli army] will take every step."</TE>
<TE>   As the day wore on, the turbulence continued across the region. In
the West Bank, a 20-year-old Israeli was shot to death near the
Jewish settlement of Ofra. In Israel, mournful music piped from
radios and television sets as townspeople in the quiet farmlands
northeast of Tel Aviv put on a somber string of nine funerals after
Wednesday's suicide bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the residents of Ramallah poured into Arafat's compound
to pick their way through the wreckage in dry-eyed disbelief. Few of
them had been able to sleep through the roar of bombs and gunfire,
and daylight lured them past the shattered gates.</TE>
<TE>   "We just wanted to see," said Patricia Kanaana, an
English-language teacher at a nearby university. When she and her
husband walked to the compound from their home in the morning, the
tang of gunpowder was still sharp in the air.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians snapped photographs, rolled video cameras and dug
through the mounds of debris for souvenirs--a soldier's cap, an
extension cord, a belt. They bought ice-cream sticks and carob juice
from peddlers. They stared at the acrid, smoking heap that used to be
the governor's office and took in the broken walkway where Arafat
usually prayed. Children raced their bicycles through the crowd, and
the entire scene was blotted monochromatic with the dust from the
vast, fallen buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "You hear the explosions, but you don't expect this much damage,"
said jeweler Samer Taha, 29. As the morning wore on, Arafat emerged
to greet the people. While the crowd chanted and cheered, he blew
kisses, waved a gnarled hand and flashed the victory sign. Television
crews in tow, he took a limping pass through his wrecked home,
footsteps crunching on broken glass. "Come see how they treat us," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   When he lifted his glance to his bombed prayer walkway, his jaw
trembled.</TE>
<TE>   A little more than a month has passed since Israeli forces pulled
out of the compound, ending a 34-day siege. Israel appears
disinclined to repeat the siege, which cast Arafat as a
long-suffering martyr and for a time fueled a surge in his flagging
popularity.</TE>
<TE>   During the spring siege, soldiers seized a few outer buildings,
hammered through walls and ransacked offices. Israeli troops kept
Arafat confined to his offices and carefully avoided striking his
private or work quarters.</TE>
<TE>   That damage was cosmetic compared with Thursday's destruction.
Mattresses, sheets and blankets protruded from the smashed layers of
a barracks. The ground was strewn with clothing, a shattered
satellite dish, loose documents and crushed cars. Entrepreneurial
children slung cables over their shoulders and slipped bolts into
their pockets.</TE>
<TE>   A young Palestinian soldier clambered high into a smashed bunker.
"Come down!" the crowd below shouted. "You're crazy!" But the soldier
ignored them and kept on pawing through mangled office chairs and
file cabinets. He was looking for his boots, it seemed, as he picked
up and inspected shoe after shoe, only to toss them to the ground and
keep sifting.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at this and think, 'OK, my taxes paid for this, and it's
gone,' " said Taha, the jeweler. "We'll build it again, and they'll
destroy it again. It goes round and round in a circle. It's not going
to end."</TE>

<HD>Suspect's Role in '95 Plot Detailed</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, alleged Sept. 11
mastermind, was a financial conduit in the plan to blow up U.S. jets,
Philippine official says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK and JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, identified as a pivotal figure in the Sept.
11 attacks, was a financial conduit in a foiled scheme to blow up 12
U.S. airliners in 1995, posing at times as a wealthy Saudi sheik and
holding meetings in luxury Manila hotels, the chief Philippines
police investigator of the plot said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Col. Rodolfo Mendoza said that after the plot was foiled, he
warned U.S. authorities that Mohammed and others who escaped also had
a plan to fly a plane into CIA headquarters in Langley, Va.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. authorities looked into his tip but did not sustain their
effort, Mendoza said. "It was not taken seriously."</LD>
<TE>   U.S. authorities would not specifically discuss Mendoza's claims
Thursday. But they said they had been aggressively searching for
Mohammed long before the September attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon, and that he managed to escape capture at least
once.</TE>
<TE>   They also confirmed that Mohammed attended a North Carolina
university in the mid-1980s, and that they were investigating whether
he had extensive movements in the United States since then. FBI
officials would not disclose the name of the college. Associated
Press reported that Mohammed had attended Chowan College in
Murfreesboro, N.C. Calls to the school were not returned.</TE>
<TE>   A former senior Justice Department official said U.S. authorities
have been searching for Mohammed since the late 1990s. In addition to
his alleged role in the airliner plot, for which he was indicted in
1996, he was also believed to be growing in importance in the Al
Qaeda terrorist network headed by Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   The former official said Mohammed was "serving in the government"
of an Arab nation in 1996 and that someone within that government
tipped the suspect off to a plan to seize him. Other officials
identified the country as Qatar.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents were near where they believed Mohammed was hiding. "We
were en route, but someone ratted us out and he went missing," the
former official said, adding that at least one other attempt to
locate and capture Mohammed failed.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI was working in tandem with Pakistani authorities to find
Mohammed, who is believed to be hiding in that country or neighboring
Afghanistan, an FBI official said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of things are going on in Pakistan," said the FBI official.
"We are working very closely with the authorities there."</TE>
<TE>   Much of Mohammed's background and activities remain a mystery, but
U.S. intelligence officials disclosed this week that they now believe
he played a key role in initiating and organizing the Sept. 11
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. intelligence official said Thursday that Mohammed made
numerous visits to Hamburg, Germany, in 1999 when the Sept. 11
hijackers were there. But he said the purpose of the trips remains
unclear and no conclusive evidence has surfaced showing Mohammed met
with Mohamed Atta, the apparent head of the hijacking teams. Other
U.S. officials had said Wednesday that Mohammed apparently met with
the hijackers in Hamburg in 1999 and had visited an apartment they
used.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza, the Philippines police official, said Mohammed appears to
have played a key role in the 1995 bomb plot known as Bojinka. The
plan was to place bombs simultaneously on 12 U.S. airliners flying
from Asia to the West Coast and to assassinate Pope John Paul II as a
distraction.</TE>
<TE>   The new information about Mohammed reinforces the view that the
Sept. 11 plot "is an old plot with some modifications," Mendoza said
in a telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   Convicted in the 1995 plot were Ramzi Yousef, later found guilty
in the 1993 truck bombing of the World Trade Center; Wali Khan Amin
Shah, an Afghan; and Abdul Hakim Murad, a Pakistani.</TE>
<TE>   The Bojinka plot was uncovered when the Manila apartment the cell
was using to make bombs caught fire. Mendoza said Mohammed was a
regular visitor to the apartment, and may also have been an occupant.
Plans were discovered in a laptop computer Yousef left behind when he
fled the fire.</TE>
<TE>   The computer contained files indicating that Mohammed was a
financial conduit for the plot. One file was a letter Yousef had
written to Mohammed asking for money. It also contained a letter
Mohammed wrote to a man prosecutors later described as a potential
financial backer of the plot.</TE>
<TE>   "To: Brother Mohammad Alsiddiqi," stated the letter, which was
introduced as evidence in the trial of Yousef and the two other
plotters. "We are facing a lot of problems because of you. Fear
Allah, Mr. Siddiqi, there is a day of judgment. You will be asked, if
you are very busy with something more important, don't give promises
to other people. See you on the day of judgment."</TE>
<TE>   "Still waiting," the letter ended. It was signed, "Khalid Shaikh,
and Bojenka."</TE>
<TE>   The plot to hijack a plane and crash it into CIA headquarters was
revealed separately by Murad during interrogation. He was reluctant
to divulge anything about Mohammed.</TE>
<TE>   Other witnesses said Mohammed met with Yousef and Khan at various
hotels in Manila. Playing the role of a Saudi Arabian sheik and
businessman, he always had money, Mendoza said. Philippine police
concluded at the time that the terrorists were linked to Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a collaboration between top Al Qaeda operatives and the
regional network of Al Qaeda from the 1995 event to the 9/11 attack,"
Mendoza said. "It is a continuing plan."</TE>
<TE>   After the plot was foiled and three of the conspirators were
arrested, intelligence agencies found indications that Mohammed was
still in the city. "My gut feeling is he didn't leave Manila during
this period," Mendoza said.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed probably used a passport with a different name when
traveling in and out of the country. A search of immigration records
turned up no record of a Khalid Shaikh Mohammed entering or leaving
the Philippines, Mendoza said.</TE>
<TE>   Police have said that the Bojinka plot was financed through a
Malaysia-based company whose directors included Khan and Riduan
Isamuddin, also known as Hambali. Hambali was never caught. Since
1995, he has allegedly organized a series of deadly bombings in the
Philippines and Indonesia and a plot to blow up embassies and
commercial buildings in Singapore.</TE>

<HD>Mubarak to Ask Bush for Peace Plan</HD>
<DH>Middle East: Egyptian leader says the U.S. should detail a
proposal for a final settlement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said Thursday that he
will ask President Bush in talks that begin today to detail a single
plan and timetable for a final peace between Israel and the
Palestinians that will end the half-century-old conflict in the next
two to three years.</LD>
<LD>   A U.S. plan is pivotal at this troubled juncture of the peace
process because Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon are so at odds that they are
unable to agree on either the process for starting negotiations or
the substance of talks, Mubarak said in an interview here with The
Times.</LD>
<LD>   "You can't leave Sharon and Arafat alone to solve the problem,"
said the Egyptian leader, who will meet with Bush at Camp David in
Maryland.</LD>
<TE>   The Bush administration has tried to broker peace negotiations by
pulling the two sides toward common ground without proposing its own
specific ideas on a political settlement. But Mubarak's message is
that this approach will no longer work.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials have stressed that ending suicide bombings by
Palestinian militants and assuring Israel's overall security should
be the first priorities of peace talks.</TE>
<TE>   But Mubarak said establishing a timetable for the creation of a
Palestinian state offers the only serious prospect for ending the
violence that has raged since September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Security alone will not put an end to the violence," he said.
"Establishing a [Palestinian] state is a must to give hope to the
people that they will have their land and their state. A Palestinian
state is the best guarantee for the security of the state of Israel."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has been prodding Arafat to move more
aggressively to stop suicide bombings. But Mubarak cautioned that
Arafat alone cannot end the spate of bombings and other attacks that
have killed more than 500 Israelis over the last 20 months,
especially given recent efforts by the Israeli military to isolate
the Palestinian leader.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot guarantee that Arafat can stop this violence," Mubarak
said. "Believe me, he can't control anything. What kind of tools does
he have? He has no tools. He can't move.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope [the violence] will stop, but as long as there are no
negotiations going on, people are desperate," he said. "You can
expect anything at any time."</TE>
<TE>   In terms of a timeline for a final settlement, Mubarak suggested
that there is some Arab flexibility on an exact date--and sensitivity
about the potential impact of American peace efforts on the 2004 U.S.
presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   He said a leading congressional figure told him recently that
negotiating a settlement, which is certain to be controversial in
some sectors of U.S. society, would be difficult during Bush's first
term.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe 2004, maybe 2005. But three years from now, I think we
should reach a solution," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak's blunt message contrasts sharply with the Israeli
position, which will be outlined again by Sharon on Monday here in
talks with Bush. The Israelis are pushing for a limited U.S. effort
in which peace negotiations focus on incremental steps, not one big
plan.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration faces the difficult task of bridging the
two opposing positions as it struggles to organize an international
conference on the Middle East this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak indicated that he is pessimistic about the prospects of
Sharon changing his position. "I don't know whether he will accept
anything," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Egyptian leader expressed disappointment at reports that
Israel is pressing the United States to drop plans to create a
political working group--which would include Israelis, Palestinians
and moderate Arab officials--to continue deliberations after the
international conference.</TE>
<TE>   One of the ideas being discussed in the Bush administration is to
create a handful of such working groups on political, security,
economic and other issues. But Mubarak, who met Thursday with Vice
President Dick Cheney, said he was told that Israel opposed the
political working group idea.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak also said that during his talks with Bush, he will warn
that any military operation aimed at toppling Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein would only unleash a "hellish" situation throughout the
Middle East, breeding more support for extremists and producing more
terrorism and violence.</TE>
<TE>   And the impact would be just as severe on American allies in the
Arab world as on the U.S., he predicted. "We are all going to suffer"
if the administration attacks Iraq, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The argument that Bush has offered to potentially justify such
action--that Iraq is a menace because of its weapons of mass
destruction--will not sell well in the Mideast, Mubarak said, because
Israel has weapons that are considered a threat to the Arab world.</TE>
<TE>   But Cheney continued to press the administration's case Thursday,
warning in a speech in Washington of a growing danger of terrorist
groups acquiring weapons of mass destruction from Iraq. "This
gathering danger requires the most careful, deliberate and decisive
response by Americans and our allies," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak said that trying to take on Hussein's regime before the
Mideast peace process is concluded could only backfire. The
administration has attempted to separate the two issues, but Mubarak
said the Arab world links them closely.</TE>
<TE>   Discussing the effort to eradicate the Al Qaeda terrorist network,
Mubarak said Egypt continues to share intelligence information with
Washington about extremist threats. He noted that there are still
"constant threats" to the U.S. and its Arab allies.</TE>
<TE>   On Libya, where Mubarak has been the chief interlocutor for the
West, the Egyptian president said Tripoli's ties to terrorism are now
"nearly zero." He described Col. Moammar Kadafi, the Libyan leader,
as "much more moderate."</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak and Bush will hold a dinner meeting today and more
detailed discussions Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Russia Welcomes Free-Market Status Recognition by the U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI and EVELYN IRITANI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Russia welcomed the news Thursday that the U.S. has designated it a
"market economy," a move that should help Russian exports and ease
the country's entry into the World Trade Organization.</LD>
<LD>   "This is of principal importance for moving Russian goods into
American markets," exulted German O. Gref, Russia's minister of
economic development and President Vladimir V. Putin's chief economic
advisor.</LD>
<LD>   "We will be getting the same possibilities to protect our rights
in the United States as any other U.S. trade partner," Gref told
Russian television.</LD>
<TE>   Putin learned of the decision from President Bush, who phoned him
Thursday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   According to Gref, the lack of free-market status had allowed U.S.
regulators to impose tariffs and other sanctions without Moscow being
fully able to defend itself because Russia was considered a
state-controlled economy. The change will especially affect the
nation's steel and chemical fertilizer industries, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Announcing the decision in Washington, Commerce Secretary Don
Evans said Russia met the necessary criteria and its new status shows
"the tremendous economic changes that Russia has made over the last
decade." The changed designation was backdated to April 1.</TE>
<TE>   Putin chided U.S. officials during a state visit by Bush here last
month for not offering free-market status earlier. At the time, Evans
explained that the Commerce Department committee in charge of the
matter had not completed the necessary reviews.</TE>
<TE>   That explanation did not sit well with many Russian commentators.
Some had complained that their nation's shift toward the West, its
newly forged political and military ties with the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and its support for the war against terrorism had
not been reciprocated with a big economic payoff.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, four days after Bush's departure from Russia, the
European Union surprised Putin and came through with its own
determination granting market status.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the American announcement, Gref said, he would not
be surprised if the United States eventually became Russia's largest
trading partner, replacing the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   Andrei V. Kortunov, a political analyst and president of the
Russian Science Foundation, a Moscow-based research organization,
told The Times in a telephone interview that the decision has three
advantages for Russia: It will revitalize foreign investment, spur
trade and raise the nation's standing with international economic
groups, especially the World Trade Organization, or WTO.</TE>
<TE>   "At the least, this decision can be presented as a sign of more
healthy and mutually beneficial relations between our countries," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   As a market economy, Russia gains some tariff benefits, but it
will also be subject to U.S. trade laws such as the countervailing
duty laws. This allows the Commerce Department to take action against
Russian companies accused of dumping subsidized goods into the U.S.
economy.</TE>
<TE>   But far more important, this brings Russia a key step closer to
joining the WTO, the powerful Geneva-based group that regulates
global commerce. To be eligible for membership, Russia has to be
recognized as a market economy by major trading partners.</TE>
<TE>   It still faces a tough road in that bid, however. Congress must
grant Russia permanent normal trade status, which is given to most
U.S. trading partners.</TE>
<TE>   To do that, Russia needs an exemption from the Jackson-Vanik
Amendment of 1974.</TE>
<TE>   The law, which tied access to U.S. trade privileges to the level
of Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union, still exists, though the
Soviet Union is gone and Jews now may freely leave Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Though Russia's support for the war on terrorism has boosted that
nation's popularity on Capitol Hill, its efforts to join the WTO
won't be smooth sailing. In May, congressional leaders from both
parties wrote Evans urging him not to grant Russia market economy
status, maintaining that Moscow has a poor record on human rights and
the rule of law. Some critics also are angry at what they see as
ongoing state dominance of business in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Rich Edlin, a New York attorney representing SPI Spirits Group,
which bought the rights to the Russian state brand Stolichnaya vodka
a decade ago and now faces a government effort to take back the name,
disagreed with giving the nation market status now.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact of the matter is, Russia has shown a complete lack of
respect for the rule of law and a complete disregard for private
property rights," the attorney said. "It would be a disaster to
essentially promote Russia when it hasn't demonstrated that it has
met the requirements that all of the countries have met."</TE>
<TE>   Russia's economic woes and political turmoil have kept it in the
minor leagues of global trade, accounting for just 1% of U.S. global
commerce. Last year, U.S.-Russia trade contracted by 8% to $8.8
billion, largely because of the slowdown in the U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   But Russia's size and rich natural resources make it one of the 10
fastest-growing markets for U.S. products, which is why many leading
American corporations support its bid to join the WTO. Poultry,
manufacturing equipment and high-technology products top the list of
U.S. exports to Russia, while the leading imports are mostly raw
materials such as platinum, oil and aluminum.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. firms argue that membership in the world's leading trade
group will force Russia to do away with protectionist trade barriers
such as steep tariffs and convoluted customs regulations. As a WTO
member, Russia would also be required to address the widespread
piracy and other intellectual property violations that have placed it
on the Commerce Department's "priority watch list."</TE>

<HD>Israel Steps Up Bid to Sideline Arafat</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Sharon and Bush will meet Monday, as U.S. tries to
craft plans for a peace conference.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>The Israeli attack on Yasser Arafat's West Bank headquarters Thursday
delivered a message not only to the Palestinian leader but also to
President Bush: This Israeli government will not bend in its refusal
to have anything to do with Arafat.</LD>
<LD>   With the rubble of Arafat's offices still smoking, Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon prepared to head to Washington for a Monday meeting with
Bush. The Israeli leader intends to make the case that convening an
international peace conference on the Middle East is impossible
unless Arafat is at least sidelined, if not expelled from Palestinian
territory.</LD>
<LD>   "The prime minister's message will be that Yasser Arafat must be
removed from power because he is an obstacle to reform," Sharon
spokesman Raanan Gissin said. "If there is a wish to move ahead with
a political process, a solution to Arafat must be found."</LD>
<TE>   Gissin insisted, however, that the government was not
contemplating Arafat's expulsion.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon requested the meeting with Bush as reports circulated here
that the U.S. administration might put forth a plan calling for a
Palestinian state to be established in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip
and parts of East Jerusalem within three years. The State Department
reportedly is arguing that the plan should be the basis for a peace
conference, which the administration hopes to convene next month.</TE>
<TE>   Arab leaders have told Bush that they and the Palestinians will
attend a conference only if the agenda includes a vision for ending
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a timetable for achieving it.</TE>
<TE>   However, any talk of an Israeli withdrawal to its pre-1967 borders
or a timetable for establishing a Palestinian state is anathema to
Sharon, a hawk who has vowed to preserve every Jewish settlement and
retain large areas of the West Bank as security buffers for Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The Sharon government's signal that it would not deal with Arafat
did not seem to immediately have the desired effect in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   One day after the White House questioned Arafat's trustworthiness,
U.S. officials insisted that they consider him the top Palestinian
leader and intend to continue to treat him as such.</TE>
<TE>   "Chairman Arafat is the leader of the Palestinian people," Richard
Boucher, the chief State Department spokesman, said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Sean McCormack, a White House spokesman, said exiling Arafat would
not solve anything. "The issue is building Palestinian institutions
and ... bringing the Palestinian people into the building of these
institutions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, U.S. leaders continued to try to prod Arafat to
do more to end terrorist attacks and bring peace.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Palestinian people expect Mr. Arafat to do more for
them, to perform," Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said in an
interview with PBS. "They have now been in the intifada for a year
and a half, and it hasn't brought them anything except grief."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has said that he is willing to negotiate only a "long-term
interim agreement" with the Palestinians. Such an arrangement would
give Palestinians control over many areas of their daily lives in
about 42% of the West Bank and much of Gaza, but it would leave
decisions about borders, sovereignty, the status of Palestinian
refugees and disputed Jerusalem unresolved for years.</TE>
<TE>   The resurgence of Palestinian suicide attacks on Israelis since
Sharon ended a large-scale military sweep through the West Bank last
month has only strengthened the prime minister's conviction that
diplomatic progress must be gradual, said Dore Gold, a foreign policy
advisor to Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, there has been a lot of talk about reform [in the
Palestinian Authority], but what we're seeing is more of the same
when it comes to how their security services are performing," Gold
said. "That really means we have not seen any change on the part of
Yasser Arafat in regards to stopping attacks on Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon and his aides have watched with consternation Bush's
consultations with Arab leaders on a framework for a conference. They
are pleased that the prime minister will have the final word before
the president decides on the U.S. position.</TE>
<TE>   "It is only proper and right that he hear firsthand from one of
the major actors: Israel," Gissin said. "It is not right that the one
actor most affected is not being consulted."</TE>
<TE>   But it is hard to see how the two leaders will be able to bridge
the chasm between Sharon's notions of the basis for a peace
conference and those of Arab leaders, analysts here said.</TE>
<TE>   "What sort of conference this will be and whether it can
conceivably be successful, given the gap between the parties and the
lack of concerted energy by the administration so far, I don't know,"
said Joseph Alpher, an independent Israeli analyst. "It will be quite
a feat of constructive ambiguity if the president succeeds in getting
both the Arabs and the Israelis there."</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Sharon might be able to avoid friction over the structure
and content of the proposed conference this time, said Itamar
Rabinovich, president of Tel Aviv University, because the U.S.
government has not yet taken a stand.</TE>
<TE>   "The potential for friction arises at the point at which the
administration fixes on a concrete idea for a [peace] settlement, or
reaches the conclusion that conditions are ripe for a settlement,"
said Rabinovich. "Then the divergence will appear."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon will travel to Washington armed with near consensus among
his generals and the Israeli public that Arafat should be expelled.
Despite the fact that Islamic Jihad, a militant group, claimed
responsibility for killing 17 Israelis in a suicide attack on a bus
Wednesday, many Israelis agree that Arafat is the inspiration, if not
the mastermind, of all attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "A terrorist infrastructure which was built over a period of seven
years does not crash in a single month," analyst Ron Leshem wrote
Thursday in the daily newspaper Yediot Aharonot. "But when the public
is crying out ... drastic moves are unavoidable."</TE>
<TE>   Sooner or later, Leshem wrote, Israel will be forced to reoccupy
the Palestinian cities it now raids almost daily and to expel Arafat.
The only question is whether these steps will occur "following a
two-digit [number of casualties] terror attack, an ultra-terror
attack or a mega-terror attack."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts here agree that the devastating assault on Arafat's
headquarters was meant to underscore to Palestinians that he is
powerless in the face of Israel's mounting anger, and to drive home
to Arafat how close he is to losing everything--perhaps even his
life.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon hopes that the shelling will also persuade the U.S.
administration that the Palestinian leader must now be pushed aside
if there is any hope of ending this conflict.</TE>

<HD>Israel Says Syria Partly to Blame for Bus Blast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Israel accused Syria on Thursday of indirect responsibility for this
week's suicide bombing of a bus in northern Israel and "brazen"
defiance of recent anti-terrorism resolutions of the Security
Council, where Syria's ambassador now sits as president.</LD>
<LD>   Islamic Jihad, a militant group that has its headquarters in
Damascus, the Syrian capital, claimed responsibility for the bus
bombing, which killed 17 Israelis on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Islamic Jihad, along with the Lebanon-based Hezbollah, are but
two of the numerous internationally recognized terrorist groups to
which the Syrian government has long provided safe haven and
financial and logistical support," the Israeli government said
Thursday in a letter to Mikhail Wehbe, Syria's ambassador to the
United Nations.</LD>
<TE>   The letter was signed by Yehuda Lancry, the Israeli ambassador,
and distributed to all 15 members of the Security Council. Wehbe is
the council president for June.</TE>
<TE>   "Yesterday's attack comes at the precise moment that Syria holds
the rotating presidency of the council, and at a time when the fight
against terrorism is at the top of the council's agenda," Lancry
wrote. "It is astounding that Syria is brazenly supporting attempts
to subvert the anti-terrorist objectives of an international body of
which it itself is president."</TE>
<TE>   The Syrian mission here did not respond Thursday to requests for
comment. But in remarks to reporters here this week, Wehbe defended
what he called his nation's "commitment" to the U.N. counter-
terrorism campaign, citing President Bashar Assad's swift public
condemnation of "the tragedy of the 11th of September."</TE>
<TE>   In a clear reference to Palestinian attacks against Israelis,
however, Wehbe said that Syria does not classify as terrorism those
acts of violence "by he who is defending his country, defending his
home."</TE>
<TE>   Security Council resolutions adopted after Sept. 11 require all
U.N. member states to ensure that their territories are not used to
provide political, financial or other support for terrorist
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.N. has failed to agree on a definition of terrorism, and
its sanctions against terrorist organizations are confined to groups
and individuals said to be linked to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
network.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Islamic Jihad nor Hezbollah is officially listed by the
U.N. as a terrorist organization, though both are designated as such
by the Bush administration.</TE>

<DL>TERD THAI, Thailand</DL>
<LD>Thai authorities evacuated about 1,000 villagers Thursday from areas
along its northern border with Myanmar, as heavy fighting raged on
the other side of the frontier.</LD>
<LD>   The latest skirmishes between Myanmar government troops and ethnic
Shan rebels began Monday.</LD>
<LD>   About 15 mortar shells fired in Myanmar landed on Thai soil but
caused no casualties or damage.</LD>
<TE>   Rebels belonging to Myanmar's Shan and Karen minorities have been
fighting for autonomy since Myanmar, formerly Burma, gained
independence from Britain in 1948. Myanmar claimed that Thai troops
fired artillery in support of Shan rebels, while Thailand said it
fired only warning shots after fighting spilled onto its soil.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,000 Thais were evacuated from Terd Thai, 470 miles north
of Bangkok, the capital, as machine-gun fire was heard and smoke rose
in the jungle. Five hundred residents of nearby Mae Mor had left
Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Reeled In by a Spoof, Chinese Daily Shrugs Off Its Capitol
Error</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>A gaffe by China's usually staid state-run media has left a popular
newspaper here with onion on its face.</LD>
<LD>   Readers of the Beijing Evening News, one of the capital's
largest-circulation newspapers, learned this week that the U.S.
Congress had threatened to move out of Washington unless a fancy new
Capitol was built.</LD>
<LD>   "Don't get us wrong. We actually love the dilapidated [old]
building," House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) was quoted as
saying. "But the cruel reality is, it's no longer suitable for use by
a world-class legislature. Its contours are ugly, there's no room to
maneuver, there aren't enough bathrooms, and let's not even talk
about the parking."</LD>
<TE>   If a new building wasn't erected, the article said, lawmakers were
prepared to pack up and move to Memphis, Tenn., or Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   The story seems newsworthy enough. Trouble is, it was lifted
straight from the Onion, a satirical "news" publication based in New
York that has caused countless American readers to double over with
laughter at its weekly spoofs on current events.</TE>
<TE>   Its story on the Capitol appeared in its May 29 edition, alongside
such headlines as "Sexual Tension Between Arafat, Sharon Reaches
Breaking Point" and "Man Blames Hangover on Everything But How Much
He Drank."</TE>
<TE>   A writer for the Beijing Evening News apparently picked up the
item from the Internet, reworked the opening paragraphs and submitted
it to his editors, who then published it Monday as a news story,
without citing a source.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody, perhaps not even the reporter, appeared to realize that it
was a joke.</TE>
<TE>   Yu Bin, the editor in charge of international news, acknowledged
Thursday that he had no idea where the writer, Huang Ke, originally
got the story. Yu said he would tell Huang to "be more careful next
time."</TE>
<TE>   But he adamantly ruled out a correction and grew slightly
obstreperous when pressed to comment on the article's total lack of
truth.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you know whether or not we checked the source before we
published the story?" Yu demanded in a phone interview. "How can you
prove it's not correct? Is it incorrect just because you say it is?"</TE>
<TE>   For the record, John Feehery, Hastert's spokesman, said the
congressman never made the remarks attributed to him.</TE>
<TE>   "He likes the Capitol just fine," Feehery said.</TE>
<TE>   However, the office of House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt
(D-Mo.) did not respond to a request Thursday for comment. Gephardt
was alleged to have said, "Look at the British Parliament. Look at
the Vatican.... Without modern facilities, they've been having big
problems attracting top talent."</TE>
<TE>   The Onion parody featured an architect's rendering of a proposed
futuristic Capitol complete with a retractable dome, a "Dancing
Waters fountain" and "55 more luxury boxes than the current
building." The Beijing paper reproduced the entire illustration
without crediting the Onion. There wasn't even a caption explaining
what the drawing was.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Siegel, editor in chief of the Onion, which prides itself
as "America's finest news source," said he was amazed at the Chinese
paper's gullibility.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow, even journalists now believe everything they read," Siegel
said from his home in New York. "If I were a reporter in Beijing and
found an item like that ... I might want to follow up and check my
sources. Readers fall for that kind of thing all the time, and maybe
I was naive, but I thought reporters would be smarter."</TE>
<TE>   That the Beijing Evening News cribbed the Onion article is
actually not so surprising in a land where movies, pop albums and
books are pirated and sold on the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Though still under the thumb of the government, the media in China
have become more freewheeling and more competitive, forced to duke it
out for market share and turn a profit.</TE>
<TE>   The Beijing Evening News, which boasts a circulation of about 1
million, is fighting off challenges from a raft of other newspapers
and magazines.</TE>
<TE>   Many papers now rely on contract freelancers to provide all sorts
of content. This has given rise to a slew of young, Internet-savvy,
English-speaking writers who freely lift stuff from the Web and
submit it to editors who adopt a "don't ask, don't tell" attitude
toward the material's origins.</TE>
<TE>   One man who used to contribute pieces to a financial
publication--he asked not to be identified--said he would simply take
copy from British and U.S. news services and translate it into
Chinese.</TE>
<TE>   Huang, the author of the Beijing Evening News article on the
unloved U.S. Capitol, couldn't be reached for comment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   He or she--the name is androgynous and very likely a
pseudonym--appears not to be one of the paper's longtime
contributors. An electronic archive search on the paper's Web site
yielded Huang's byline on only two stories in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Both appeared in Monday's edition. One was the Onion rip-off. The
other, on the same page, was an investigative piece about the lack of
security screening for most private charter flights in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   But a little checking showed that this story too was cribbed: It
was a direct translation of a front-page article from Sunday's
Washington Post.</TE>

<HD>Fatherhood Transcends Biology, High Court Says</HD>
<DH>Law: Man wins custody of a child he never adopted. Ruling
does not address gay parents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A man may win paternity and custody of a child he has cared for even
if he is not the biological father and the mother objects, the
California Supreme Court ruled unanimously Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The state high court held that biology does not necessarily
determine fatherhood, even if the man never married the biological
mother.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling is the first of its kind by a state Supreme Court,
legal experts said. It is based on a model law, the Uniform Parentage
Act, that is also on the books in about 18 other states and therefore
may have considerable influence nationwide, lawyers said.</LD>
<TE>   Thursday's case did not address gay parents or grandparents who
rear children, but it underscored the court's willingness to look to
the best interests of the child, regardless of biology.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling "clearly establishes that people who know from day one
that they aren't biological parents can through their conduct become
parents," said Deborah Wald, an attorney for the National Center for
Lesbian Rights. "And that is huge."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling came in the case of Nicholas H., now 6, who has lived
in Lakewood with Thomas G., 29, a salesman, while the case has been
pending before the state high court. A Court of Appeal had held that
Thomas had no paternity rights because he acknowledged he was not the
boy's biological father.</TE>
<TE>   The state high court, noting that its decision was "of the gravest
concern to the six-year-old boy involved in this case," disagreed,
saying it was enough that Thomas had taken on the role of father.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's mother, Kimberly H., began dating Thomas when she was
three months pregnant. They split up when Nicholas was 4, and Thomas
eventually gained custody. He charged that his former girlfriend was
using drugs and was homeless at times.</TE>
<TE>   The identity of the biological father has never been legally
determined, and no other man has ever come forward to claim
paternity.</TE>
<TE>   Sheri M. Cohen, a lawyer for Kimberly, complained that Thursday's
decision will encourage "former boyfriends, relatives and even foster
parents" to assert parental rights over biological mothers.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen noted that Thomas never attempted to adopt the boy or marry
his mother.</TE>
<TE>   "We fear this case is going to open the floodgates of litigation
for people who play parental roles to small children," Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   But Francia M. Welker, a court-appointed attorney for the child,
said the decision was "wonderful in terms of providing children with
fathers." She said the blond-haired Nicholas is bright and healthy
and loves both his parents, but prefers to live with Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas has taught his son to swim and play baseball and is active
in his school, lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   "He thinks his dad is Tom, and what do you know? He is right. This
is the dad he has always known," Welker said.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas decided he wanted to become the boy's father after dating
the pregnant Kimberly, Welker said.</TE>
<TE>   "The child was not going to have a father, and Kimberly really is
quite a beautiful woman," said Welker. "I guess it just touched
Thomas' heart. He was going to do the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas was present at the boy's birth and his name was listed on
the birth certificate.</TE>
<TE>   The couple split up at least once before separating for good, the
court said. Thomas gave Kimberly and Nicholas financial support--how
much is in debate--when they were not living together.</TE>
<TE>   Kimberly, because of drug abuse and mental instability, was unable
to provide a stable home for Nicholas, the court said.</TE>
<TE>   The mother "has been a frail reed for Nicholas to lean upon,"
Justice Janice Rogers Brown wrote for the court, while "Thomas has
been a constant in Nicholas's life."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas was the presumed father under the state's paternity laws
because he openly held Nicholas to be his son and cared for and
supported him.</TE>
<TE>   "A man does not lose his status as a presumed father by admitting
he is not the biological father," Brown wrote.</TE>
<TE>   If the court ruled otherwise, "this child will be rendered
fatherless and homeless," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Kimberly and Thomas charged each other with domestic abuse. Thomas
was once arrested for allegedly battering Kimberly and pleaded guilty
to a misdemeanor battery in Los Angeles in 1997, his lawyer said.
Kimberly also was arrested for battery for allegedly biting Thomas,
the court said.</TE>
<TE>   "Thomas was not a perfect candidate for fatherhood, if any such
there be," Brown conceded.</TE>
<TE>   But fatherhood, she continued, "does not depend on the presumed
father's being a paragon. What is dispositive is the presumed
father's relationship with and responsibility for the child."</TE>
<TE>   Kimberly's lawyer said the court's description of Kimberly was
based on old allegations and described Kimberly, who lives in the San
Francisco Bay Area, as hurt and disappointed by the portrayal.</TE>
<TE>   "She had custody for 4 1/2 years," Cohen said, and at the time the
court fight began, Nicholas was "considered to be a delightful,
healthy child."</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas is completely unaware of the court case, his lawyer said.
He has been visiting his mother in the Bay Area twice a month on
weekends while living with Thomas and Thomas' mother, Welker said.</TE>
<TE>   The boy wants his parents to reunite, his lawyer said, but "if he
can't have that, he would like to stay where he is and see his mom as
often as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Gay and lesbian rights groups have closely followed the case, In
re Nicholas S100490. Custody disputes often arise when same-sex
partners with children split up and the biological parent refuses to
let the former partner continue to be involved with the child. Courts
have generally sided with the biological parent in such cases.</TE>
<TE>   Wald, of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said Thursday's
ruling was the first in a case in which parental rights were granted
to a presumed parent who knew he or she was not the biological
parent, and was not married to the biological parent.</TE>
<TE>   "It is wonderful that courts are looking beyond strict, formulaic
definitions of what constitutes a parent and are looking instead at
who is important to the children," Wald said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Frank H. Free, who represented Thomas in the case,
praised the "recognition by the state Supreme Court that biology is
not the most important factor in determining paternity."</TE>
<TE>   The decision means not only that Thomas can have custody of the
boy and the right to guide his development and education, Free said.
It also ensures that Nicholas will share in Thomas' health care,
workers' compensation and Social Security benefits, and inherit
Thomas' property if Thomas dies without a will, the lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   The case began in Juvenile Court in Alameda County, where a judge
gave custody to Thomas. The county argued in the case that a ruling
for Thomas would force judges to make arbitrary decisions about
paternity based on their opinion of the would-be father.</TE>
<TE>   County Counsel Richard Winnie said Thursday that the decision will
place "a greater burden on the courts to decide who deserves ...
parenthood in the most sensitive situations."</TE>

<HD>New Life Vs. Old Murder</HD>
<DH>Emily Montague put her violent past as Emily Harris behind
her. To some it's unfathomable that she now faces trial in a 1975
bank killing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a young FBI agent in the mid-1970s, James Botting spent 18 months
looking for Emily Harris and her fugitive band of Symbionese
Liberation Army terrorists. Roaming the country, he kept her wanted
poster in his briefcase and her face--bright, blue-eyed,
imperious--ever present in his mind.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-five years later, when it no longer mattered, he found her.</LD>
<LD>   By that time, Botting had left the FBI and become head of security
for MGM Studios in Santa Monica. There, he was stunned to discover
Harris working for the studio under a new name as a highly paid,
highly respected computer programmer.</LD>
<TE>   The face hadn't changed, Botting noticed. But just about
everything else had.</TE>
<TE>   No longer a fugitive, no longer an avatar of armed revolution,
Emily Montague--the name she had taken after she was released from
prison in 1983--was now a quiet, middle-aged, middle-class computer
consultant with a six-figure salary and a comfortable home in
Altadena. She had paid a debt to the society she once battled: more
than seven years behind bars for kidnapping, robbery, auto theft and
other charges. Now she had a dog, a sensible wardrobe, a loving
family, a long list of charitable activities. Divorced from Bill
Harris, she had a long-term, committed relationship with another
woman.</TE>
<TE>   Once considered one of the country's most dangerous criminals, she
was now, by all outward appearances, a pillar of the community.</TE>
<TE>   Paralyzed by professional propriety, Botting couldn't bring
himself to approach her.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have loved to sit down and just talk to Emily off the
record, but neither one of us could do that," said Botting, who has
since left MGM and is chief of police for the Ventura Community
College District. "So I never did. We never talked; she probably
never knew I existed--and then this whole thing came down a few
months ago."</TE>
<TE>   In January, Harris was arrested on murder charges. She, her
ex-husband and three other people associated with the SLA are accused
of shooting to death a bystander during a 1975 bank robbery in
Carmichael, a Sacramento suburb. She is now free on $1-million bail
pending a trial next year.</TE>
<TE>   The case has brought on stage, for one more encore, the most
operatic and violent of the radical groups to emerge from the leftist
antiwar movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Melding black
ex-convicts with white, college-educated radicals, the SLA preached a
"symbiosis" of races that would throw off the "puritan capitalist
ethics of competition, individualism, fascism, racism, sexism and
imperialism."</TE>
<TE>   And so, out of the shadows has emerged Emily Harris, SLA code name
Yolanda, who at 55 might be settling into a comfortable middle age,
were she not accused of pulling the trigger on Myrna Lee Opsahl.</TE>
<TE>   It was a blast that did not echo loudly at the time. Initially, it
seemed another random act of violence, and wasn't publicly linked to
the SLA. Even after the group was blamed, the Opsahl murder never
achieved the Day-Glo celebrity of the SLA's signature acts of mayhem,
which included the assassination of Oakland schools chief Marcus
Foster, the kidnapping of publishing heiress Patricia Hearst, and an
apocalyptic shootout with Los Angeles police in which six SLA
"soldiers" died with their hide-out in flames.</TE>
<TE>   No one had ever been charged with the murder. Prosecutors at the
time said they simply lacked the evidence. One SLA associate, Steven
Soliah, was charged with the robbery, but he was acquitted, seemingly
ending any likelihood that anyone would be held accountable for
Opsahl's death.</TE>
<TE>   That seemed true even after Hearst wrote her 1982 memoir, "Every
Secret Thing." It dramatically described Hearst's kidnapping and
conversion to the SLA's cause, but also included a detailed
description of the Carmichael robbery.</TE>
<TE>   In a passage that came to haunt Myrna Opsahl's family, Hearst
wrote that after the holdup, Emily Harris admitted she had shot a
woman.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't really matter," Hearst quoted her as saying. "She was
a bourgeois pig anyway. Her husband is a doctor."</TE>
<TE>   Harris denies taking part in the robbery, much less killing
Opsahl, much less bragging about it. "Unequivocally, I was not
involved," she said in an interview in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Harris gave that interview not long after the arrest in Minnesota
of Steven Soliah's sister, Kathy Soliah, who had been living for
years as a fugitive under the name Sara Jane Olson. She was charged
with, and ultimately convicted of, trying to bomb two Los Angeles
Police Department squad cars for the SLA.</TE>
<TE>   Friends said Harris knew Olson's arrest could lead prosecutors to
reopen the Opsahl murder case. That Harris did not flee, despite
having the opportunity and means to do so, shows how much she has
changed, these supporters say.</TE>
<TE>   To take a measure of how far Emily Harris has traveled since her
days as an urban guerrilla, scurrying from one low-rent SLA safe
house to another, one need only drive by the home in Altadena that
she bought in 1995 and occupies with her partner, Noreen Baca.</TE>
<TE>   It is a well-tended, four-bedroom, Spanish-stucco house with a
chimney, a tidy cactus garden and a tall, overarching tree in front.
Attached to the tree is a wooden placard bearing the house address.
Attached to the placard is a small American flag.</TE>
<TE>   The surrounding neighborhood, overwhelmingly white and affluent,
shadowed by the San Gabriel Mountains and graced with Craftsman-style
homes dating to the early 20th century, has the sturdy Midwestern
feel of so many older Southern California neighborhoods that were
settled by newcomers from the heartland.</TE>
<TE>   It is, in many ways, the sort of neighborhood in which Emily
Montague Schwartz grew up in the 1950s and 1960s in the northern
suburbs of Chicago. Her parents and lifelong friends say she has
become again the person they knew as a child. Smart, sensible,
well-adjusted; nobody's rebel.</TE>
<TE>   Her lawyer, Stuart Hanlon, refers to her, with apologies, as "a
sorority girl," something she was when she attended the University of
Indiana. "Suzy Sorority" is the way one old friend remembers her, a
conservative girl who wore matching skirts and sweaters--cute, never
provocative.</TE>
<TE>   Hers is a variation on a theme. Kathleen Soliah remade her life as
a Minnesota soccer mom. Soliah's brother-in-law and co-defendant,
Michael Bortin, ran a hardwood flooring business in Portland, Ore.
Bill Harris remarried and found work as a criminal investigator in
San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Emily Harris found her own path back to the bourgeoisie.</TE>
<TE>   In August 1997, Joanie Lubrant hosted a reunion of high school
girlfriends at her home in Aspen, Colo. Three came, including Harris.
Those who were there recall a weekend of nonstop talking, broken only
by TV coverage of the death of Princess Diana of Britain. Harris'
wild years never came up, at least not directly.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Clay Benson, one of the classmates from Hinsdale Central
High School, recalled only one awkward moment, involving one of the
other women.</TE>
<TE>   "She had made a comment to Emily, something like, 'Gee, I need to
learn how to use a computer' and 'How did you get to be so good on
computers?' And Emily said, 'Seven years in prison.' "</TE>
<TE>   Few people, even among her closest friends, can answer the two
questions that seem central to understanding Emily Harris: What
turned an All-American sorority girl into a violent revolutionary?
And what turned her back into Emily Montague?</TE>
<TE>   Friends recall Harris as apolitical until midway through college,
around the time she met a garrulous, politically engaged Vietnam
veteran named Bill Harris,  moving with him from Indiana to Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   "They ... began feeling there was no way to change the world but
to get violent," said Hanlon.</TE>
<TE>   One key to understanding why they became violent, Hanlon and
others believe, is that the SLA was an underground organization cut
off from society and the rest of the radical left. "A group of people
get closed off from the world, believe only themselves, talk only to
themselves and start to believe it," Hanlon said.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Shoup, a novelist who has been friends with Harris since
college and wrote a book partially based on Harris' life, believes
the very strength of her personality made her susceptible to
political extremism. "When I run that all through my mind, the only
thing that makes sense to me is my knowledge of her as a person who
does everything she does 100%. So once she entered that world, she
would enter it fully."</TE>
<TE>   Harris was sentenced in 1976 and again in 1978 for crimes that
included the Hearst kidnapping. The woman who was sent to prison was
defiant, arrogant and very much a revolutionary. In an interview with
New Times magazine before her first trial in 1976, Harris justified
the use of violence as a revolutionary tool and predicted "the spirit
of the SLA will always be carried on, no matter what the name of the
group or organization."</TE>
<TE>   But something happened to Harris during her years at the
California Institute for Women in Corona.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she grew tremendously," Shoup said. "She thought about
all those things and reflected on them.... And the voice of her
letters changed. The earlier letters were more strident, they spoke
more about politics, and the later letters--I recognized her voice.
It was the voice of my friend.''</TE>
<TE>   "They kept on messing with her in prison because she was SLA,"
Hanlon said. "They kept on locking her up, they kept on taking away
privileges. And Emily reached this decision that we talked about,
that, 'If I don't want anything, they can't take anything away from
me.' So she stopped smoking, she stopped wanting the TV.... She never
fought. She just said, 'I don't need that.' She started living in her
mind, and exercising."</TE>
<TE>   She also discovered a profession.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1970s, Apple had just released the world's first true
personal computer. Harris' prison began offering word-processing
classes. She enrolled and became fluent in computer programming.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a very smart student," recalled Joanne Dubois, a prison
teaching assistant at the time. "She got to the point where she could
go out to the community and get a job with no problem."</TE>
<TE>   Harris was released at a perfect time to begin a career in
computers. She was hired by Unisys Corp. in Westwood, and after two
years moved to the Walt Disney Co. in Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   "She was wonderful," recalled Bill Clune, who--unaware of her
background--hired her for a contract job at Disney and then
recommended her for a full-time position. There,  Harris became an
expert in the highly complex use of computers to track film rights.</TE>
<TE>   "You're writing or designing computer systems that are really
capturing rules established by attorneys, and they change," Clune
said. "The hard part is understanding all the different rules, and
what rules were in place at what point in time, and dealing with a
lot of the personalities in the film business.... There's probably 50
to 100 people in the world who really specialize in that type of
thing. As I said, Emily is very good at it."</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Harris began her own consulting business. Her clients
have included Paramount Pictures, MGM Studios and Spelling
Productions. Since her arrest, Hanlon said, business has dried up.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time she was establishing her business, Harris was
making new friends. She had come out as a lesbian in prison, said
Hanlon, and her social life reflected that change. She rode a bicycle
from Los Angeles to San Francisco in a charity AIDS ride and also was
involved in Habitat for Humanity, the Revlon Breast Cancer Walk and
Living Free, an organization that rescues stray dogs and cats.</TE>
<TE>   She built, by many standards, an exemplary resume.</TE>
<TE>   "She is a kind and loving person and has many friends who love
her," wrote Carol Baca, the mother of Emily's partner, in a letter to
the court. "She is a wonderful asset to her friends, family,
community and neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   There are people who take strong exception to that. Bob Blackburn
was assistant superintendent of schools in Oakland when he and his
boss and best friend, Marcus Foster, were ambushed by the SLA. Foster
was killed, Blackburn seriously wounded. Harris was not among those
charged and has insisted she was only an SLA sympathizer at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Blackburn wonders if she didn't help plan the attack. He
said he believes she killed Opsahl and should be held to answer for
it.</TE>
<TE>   "How many years do you have to live as a good citizen before the
murder you committed is forgiven?" he said. "Let's see justice and
then we'll talk about reconciliation or whatever. It would go down a
lot better with me if, instead of putting up a lot of legal
pyrotechnics to get off, if Ms. Montague would come forth and say,
'You know what, you're perfectly right, this is what I did. And I am
haunted by it, and I throw myself on the mercy of the court and I beg
forgiveness from the family. I've dreaded this day, and it's here,
and it's time for me to come clean.'"</TE>
<TE>   Another doubter is Eleanor Hunter, one of two deputy district
attorneys in Los Angeles who looked into the Opsahl case while
prosecuting Kathy Soliah.</TE>
<TE>   "Up until this time she's been incredibly lucky," Hunter said.
"But she was able to shoot a woman and essentially just continue with
the robbery and show absolutely no remorse. You ask, has she changed?
She continues to show absolutely no remorse."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there is Dr. Jon Opsahl, who pushed authorities for years
to find and prosecute his mother's killer. "What purpose would it
serve for her to be convicted and put in prison?" Opsahl asked. "The
purpose is this little thing called justice. We have a moral
obligation to society to hold killers accountable. Even after 27
years."</TE>
<TE>   The case against her largely rests on whether a jury will believe
Hearst. Hanlon argues that the new evidence claimed by prosecutors is
neither new nor significant. The Sacramento district attorney's
office declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, some of Harris' closest friends acknowledge being
troubled by a thought: What if she did do it?</TE>
<TE>   "I've asked myself that question a lot," said Joanie Lubrant. "I
think, '27 years later, what's the point?' And yet, had it been my
mother that was killed and justice hadn't been done and the case was
still open, would I look at it differently? I go back and forth on
this."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real test to our belief system," said Margaret Conger, now
a high school counselor. On the one hand, she said, Harris has paid a
debt to society. On the other: "What debt can you pay for death? I
mean, there is no debt you can pay for that."</TE>
<TE>   Harris declined to be interviewed for this story. In an interview
with The Times in 1999, she discussed her past, but obliquely.</TE>
<TE>   "Any person's life is an evolution and growth path," she said. The
SLA "was one of the phases that my life went through. I made choices
and, looking back now, I think some of those choices were extremely
reckless and ill-conceived. But I paid the price. I've moved on."</TE>

<HD>Angry Residents Sink Police Chief's Surf Cam</HD>
<DH>Beaches: Images are taken off Web over fear of luring
crowds to Palos Verdes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For three months and 12 days, the video camera panned the waves that
peel across one of Palos Verdes' most popular surf spots, displaying
the images over the Internet and beckoning anyone who saw them to
visit the beach.</LD>
<LD>   The "surf cam" was the police chief's idea. He thought that if it
were trained on the beach it would help deter fights that had been
breaking out between local surfers fiercely protective of their turf
and outsiders brazen enough to crash the beach. The camera became a
public symbol of the chief's campaign to end the violence and
vandalism associated with the notorious locals and their credo: If
you don't live here, don't surf here.</LD>
<LD>   This week, the camera came down.</LD>
<TE>   City officials said it was a casualty of a well-orchestrated
campaign to scare residents into believing that the online images of
the gorgeous coastline and graceful waves would draw hordes of rowdy
surfers to this neighborhood of multimillion-dollar, bluff-top homes.</TE>
<TE>   Giving in to community pressure, the Palos Verdes Estates City
Council voted unanimously last month to take down the camera, which
had been provided free to the city by Surfline. com in Huntington
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the council decided to buy its own camera for $11,000. It
will do the same thing as the Surfline camera, monitoring activity on
the beach and in the water--only no one will be able to see what's
going on except the police.</TE>
<TE>   The decision came after raucous City Council meetings and a
door-to-door campaign by members of the Bay Boys, a multigenerational
surf gang that jealously guards the waves at Lunada Bay and other
prime surf breaks.</TE>
<TE>   The Bay Boys stirred up local concerns by leafleting neighborhoods
with warnings of an impending crush of surfers who would clog
residential streets, strip naked as they changed into wetsuits,
urinate in bushes and leave trash.</TE>
<TE>   At one meeting, Bruce R. Geernaert, a Palos Verdes resident and
retired Los Angeles Superior Court judge, grew so passionate as he
listed his objections to the commercial web camera that police had to
remove him from the council chambers, city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Another Palos Verdes resident, a surfer who lives near Lunada Bay,
joined with an attorney to sue the city over the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit charges that the city should have performed an
environmental impact review of the "potentially significant impact on
residential neighborhoods due to the traffic, noise and congestion
that will result from broadcasting coastal conditions on the
Internet."</TE>
<TE>   But for the three months the camera was operational, the hordes
never came, said Police Chief Timm Browne. "We never had any crowds
or any problems."</TE>
<TE>   Sean Collins, president of Surfline, said none of his nearly 100
surf cams posted in California and elsewhere has significantly
changed the crowds at a surf spot. Most of these cyber surfers watch
the streaming video of waves for entertainment, he said. It's done
during business hours. Mostly from work.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a full-on scare tactic," Collins said. "The bottom line is
that the locals don't want outsiders coming in. They put tremendous
pressure on elected officials to pull it [the camera] out. They won.
Localism works."</TE>
<TE>   The council's decision short-circuits plans to install another
Surfline camera overlooking Lunada Bay.</TE>
<TE>   The camera was going to be sponsored by the South Bay chapter of
Surfrider, a surfer lobbying group.</TE>
<TE>   Members from Torrance, Redondo and Hermosa beaches have complained
bitterly over the years of gang-style intimidation from rich surfers
on the hill in Palos Verdes to discourage surfers showing up from the
flatlands.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Rosemary Humphrey, the city's mayor, nor Fred Mackenbach,
mayor pro tem, returned calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   City Manager Jim Hendrickson said city leaders hope the new
closed-circuit camera will also act as a deterrent.</TE>
<TE>   City leaders were sorry to lose the free camera, but had little
choice after ceaseless concerns that it would "bring droves of people
during high surf, damage property and bring deleterious effects."</TE>
<TE>   "We did not detect any of that," Hendrickson said. "But perception
can become reality."</TE>
<TE>   City officials sought out Surfline in February after a beach brawl
brought public attention to the territorial tensions between groups
of surfers.</TE>
<TE>   The camera was installed on the police chief's house, one of
several city-owned homes perched on a bluff that overlooks two surf
spots called the Cove and Indicator.</TE>
<TE>   The camera panned the beach where a brawl had broken out involving
43-year-old Tim Banas, a surfer from Hermosa Beach and a local surfer
less than half his age. Although the facts are in dispute, the fight
ended when Banas' teenage son, Tommy, threw a rock that lacerated the
skull of a man grappling with his father, according to police
reports.</TE>
<TE>   The altercation resulted in criminal charges against Tommy Banas.</TE>
<TE>   It also prompted a lawsuit by Timothy Banas against the city of
Palos Verdes Estates, five identified local surfers and up to 50
other unidentified members of a clique known as the Dirty Underwear
Gang.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the lawsuit aims to designate the clique as a
criminal street gang under the state's Street Terrorism Enforcement
and Prevention Act, a law used to combat inner-city gangs.</TE>
<TE>   If that happens, attorney Michael F. Sisson said he will ask a
judge to ban members of the group from congregating or surfing at
Palos Verdes prime surf breaks known as Haggerty's, the Cove,
Indicator and Lunada Bay.</TE>

<HD>Now Comes Hard Part for Congress</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Members applaud Bush's move, even as it sets
up a complex debate over the details of establishing a new
department.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON and VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For months, lawmakers have clamored for President Bush to unify the
nation's defenses against terrorism in a single new agency with full
Cabinet status. On Thursday, Bush finally agreed.</LD>
<LD>   But don't expect Congress to set any speed records in passing the
legislation necessary to make the Department of Homeland Security a
reality.</LD>
<LD>   While congressional leaders from both major parties lauded the
Bush initiative, what lies ahead is a lengthy, complex debate over
the details of exactly how to do it. When it comes to specifics,
almost no one has more at stake than members of Congress themselves.
And since Sept. 11, many lawmakers have their own ideas about what
should be done.</LD>
<TE>   "The war on terrorism has expanded to the war on turf," said Rep.
Jane Harman (D-Venice), who called Bush's proposal "courageous."</TE>
<TE>   The task facing Congress is especially difficult because the Bush
plan calls for creating the department out of scores of agencies and
offices now lodged in eight Cabinet departments. Moving the pieces
around will be a complicated process. Designing an efficient new
organization that melds them will be even more challenging.</TE>
<TE>   And the changes will raise sticky questions of jurisdiction for
congressional committees that now oversee the existing organizations.
These committees wield enormous power over spending, policy and even
the daily operations of these agencies. Juggling the organizational
chart means juggling jurisdiction. Who will lose power and who will
win?</TE>
<TE>   To get his plan through Congress, experts say, Bush will have to
placate--or, if necessary, roll over--dozens of powerful committees
and subcommittees, many with a vested interest in preserving the
status quo.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) agreed that approving
the plan before Congress adjourns this fall will be a major
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a huge lift," Lott said, likening Congress to a
weightlifter. "But we should get it done."</TE>
<TE>   Many lawmakers approved of the president's plan in the abstract
but raised questions about key details. And criticism emerged from
some quarters.</TE>
<TE>   One senior congressional aide said he had heard many agencies
affected by the proposed overhaul were surprised by Thursday's
announcement.</TE>
<TE>   "These agencies did not know this is happening. What that tells me
is, the vetting that should have occurred did not take place," said
Scott Lilly, director of Democratic staff on the House Appropriations
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The White House, Lilly contended, is "making this decision by
executive fiat, and they're not talking to people involved at the
action level. I predict there will be large problems." However,
bipartisan support for a Cabinet-level homeland security post has
grown steadily in recent months. One bill similar to the president's
plan has cleared a Senate committee and is gaining support in the
House.</TE>
<TE>   That bill, sponsored by Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), is
likely to be melded with the president's plan through negotiations
with the administration. Other lawmakers may also propose amendments.</TE>
<TE>   "The president is doing the right thing," said Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison (R-Texas). But, she added, "we may have to look at it and
fine-tune it."</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Hutchison, a leading sponsor of last year's aviation
security bill, is likely to take a close look at Bush's proposal to
move the 41,000 employees in the new Transportation Security
Administration from the Transportation Department to the proposed
Homeland Security Department.</TE>
<TE>   Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), both
members of the Senate's intelligence committee, said they would
scrutinize proposals to include intelligence analysis in the new
department. And House Judiciary Committee Chairman F. James
Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.), author of a House-passed immigration
reform bill, is likely to look closely at the proposed transfer of
border security functions from the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman, who applauded Bush, was surprised to learn from a
reporter that the Secret Service would be moved from the Treasury
Department to the proposed department. "Really?" he asked. "I'll have
to think about that."</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, supporters of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
in California questioned the president's proposal to make it part of
the new department.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think this is going to go very far," a congressional
aide said, noting that the laboratory and the Department of Energy,
which oversees it, were caught off guard by the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   As Congress considers reorganizing the executive branch, some
lawmakers and analysts say it may need to consider reorganizing
itself. It is unclear what committee would oversee a Homeland
Security Department; many could stake a claim.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Harold Rogers (R-Ky.), chairman of the House Transportation
Appropriations subcommittee, said some lawmakers may lose
jurisdiction over agencies they now oversee.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a very difficult thing to achieve," he said, "but
it's worth looking at."</TE>

<CX>   New Cabinet department -- A graphic accompanying a story in Friday's
Section A on the proposal for a Cabinet-level department to oversee
homeland security included an incorrect figure. The total budget for
the four proposed agencies that would make up the department was
correct as $37.5 billion, but the budget for one of those agencies,
the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection office, is
$364 million, not $364 billion.</CX>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In creating a giant new Cabinet department to defend the nation from
terrorist attacks, President Bush is hoping to solve several problems
at once--some real, some bureaucratic, some merely political.</LD>
<LD>   The president's decision was a tacit admission that the
8-month-old experiment of coordinating homeland security from a small
office in the White House wasn't working. Former Pennsylvania Gov.
Tom Ridge, with only a few assistants and no authority over anyone
else's budget, found that existing federal agencies responded slowly,
if at all, to his commands.</LD>
<LD>   When anthrax spores turned up in the nation's mail system, Ridge
had a hard time getting health agencies to coordinate their actions.
When the Pentagon decided to cut back on patrol flights over the
nation's cities, Ridge didn't learn about it until after the planes
landed.</LD>
<TE>   "Ridge didn't have the authority to command action from anyone,"
said Paul C. Light of the nonpartisan Brookings Institution. "As a
Vietnam veteran, he must have felt as if they had given him another
war to fight without the tools to win it."</TE>
<TE>   But now, if Ridge becomes the first secretary of the Department of
Homeland Security, he'll have almost 170,000 people and more than $37
billion at his command.</TE>
<TE>   "Cabinet status is the coin of the realm in this town," Light
said. "It determines how you're treated. It determines the size of
your car and how quickly your phone calls are returned."</TE>
<TE>   There are political considerations too. White House aides have
openly worried that the public is no longer as focused on the danger
of terrorism as it was in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. They
have watched glumly as public confidence in the federal
anti-terrorism effort has sagged (although Bush's own popularity
rating has remained strong).</TE>
<TE>   "When we ask whether people believe the government is doing enough
to protect them against terrorism, we've seen a surge in the number
who don't know if anything real is being done," Republican pollster
Bill McInturff said. "There's a communications job to do, and it's
probably easier to do as a Cabinet secretary.</TE>
<TE>   "The first function of the homeland security job was reassurance,
but now it's partly to remind the country of the need to stay focused
and do more."</TE>
<TE>   The controversy over apparent missteps by the FBI and the CIA in
handling intelligence about terrorist threats wasn't helping. "If you
think the intelligence story didn't affect this decision, you're
kidding yourself," a GOP political advisor said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the president referred to the intelligence inquiries
during his brief television speech Thursday evening, asking FBI and
CIA officials to treat information about possible terrorist attacks
"with the seriousness it deserves" and telling the two agencies that
"they must think and act differently to defeat the enemy."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Republicans and Democrats, noting the unexpected sweep of
Bush's proposal, were inclined to give him credit for making this
decision largely on the basis of substance, not politics.</TE>
<TE>   The new Department of Homeland Security would be the third largest
in the Cabinet and would include some of the crown jewels of much
older agencies, like the Secret Service and the Customs Service (from
the Treasury Department) and the Coast Guard (from the Department of
Transportation).</TE>
<TE>   In that sense, it rang true when Bush declared he was proposing
the most significant reorganization of the federal government since
1947, when President Truman unified the Defense Department and
created the National Security Council and the CIA to fight the Cold
War.</TE>
<TE>   "When a society faces a fundamentally new mission, it makes sense
to create a new agency," says David Osborne, a Democrat who advised
then-President Clinton on ways to reorganize the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   "We did that with the Defense Department in 1947 and the
Environmental Protection Agency in 1970. Now the mission is
protecting the homeland, but Ridge had an impossible job: doing that
mission without any operational control.</TE>
<TE>   "By creating one agency with responsibility for an issue, you
heighten the issue's profile. You centralize your resources. So the
people in charge have more leverage and a better chance to carry out
your strategy effectively," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But some experts on the federal bureaucracy warned that creating a
Cabinet department brings problems too.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a public administration rule of thumb: When you're
creating a new agency, do something that's easy to undo," said
Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution, who advised Presidents
Eisenhower and Nixon. "A Cabinet department is pretty much forever.
But we don't know if this danger from terrorism will be a permanent
condition."</TE>
<TE>   Bush and his aides acknowledged that it came hard for
small-government Republicans to create a gigantic agency--in terms of
budget and staff size, it would rank behind only the Defense
Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs. But they promised
to try to use the consolidation of security functions to keep
spending under control.</TE>
<TE>   Hess and Light saw one more problem with the new department. "It's
a real smorgasbord," Hess said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be hard to make it work," Light warned. "You have
at least two cultures there. You have customer-oriented,
people-helping agencies like FEMA [the Federal Emergency Management
Agency] and the INS [Immigration and Naturalization Service]. And you
have law enforcement agencies like the Customs Service and the
Transportation Security Agency. It's going to be hard to get them
together."</TE>
<TE>   And consolidation doesn't always mean improvement, Light said.
"FEMA is one of the best-run agencies in the government. If it ain't
broke, don't move it."</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Homeland Security, if Congress creates it, would
be the government's 15th Cabinet department.</TE>
<TE>   George Washington had only five Cabinet members: secretaries of
State, War and Treasury, plus an attorney general and postmaster
general. (The post office was the 18th century's high-speed
communication infrastructure.)</TE>
<TE>   Abraham Lincoln had seven Cabinet secretaries; in addition to
Washington's five, he had a secretary of the Navy and, with the
opening of the West, a secretary of the Interior.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 20th century, more new departments reflected the
industrialization of the economy and the expansion of the federal
government's role in domestic affairs. Commerce and Labor was created
(as a single department) in 1903. Health, Education and Welfare
(later split) was formed in 1953.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Energy was created by President Carter in
response to an energy crisis in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   Other departments were created as political balm for constituent
groups. Carter created a separate Department of Education in 1980 at
the request of teachers. Reagan turned the Veterans Administration
into a Cabinet-level department in 1989 as a salute to veterans.</TE>
<TE>   But since 1789, only one president has stripped a department of
Cabinet status: In 1971, Richard Nixon turned the Post Office
Department into the U.S. Postal Service.</TE>

<LD>A recount in Kentucky's tight Democratic U.S. Senate primary race
produced an even narrower victory margin for the daughter of a former
governor of the state.</LD>
<LD>   The Kentucky secretary of state's canvass of votes tallied May 28
showed Lois Combs Weinberg beat former Rep. Tom Barlow by 958 votes
out of more than 460,000 cast--fewer than her election night margin
of 989 votes.</LD>
<LD>   Weinberg, the daughter of former Gov. Bert Combs, will face GOP
Sen. Mitch McConnell in November. McConnell, 60, was unopposed for
the GOP nomination.</LD>

<BD>From Times wire reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge fined 20 members of an Amish sect for refusing to put bright
orange reflective triangles on their horse-drawn buggies, saying
public safety overrides any religious objections.</LD>
<LD>   The Swartzentruber Amish had complained that the symbols violate
their beliefs.</LD>
<LD>   The sect was hit with 27 of the $95 fines for failing to use the
slow-moving vehicle symbol.</LD>
<TE>   Their lawyer, Donna Doblick, said she will appeal. The Amish, who
live near Nicktown, about 65 miles from Pittsburgh, have said they
will leave Pennsylvania if they lose the case.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of the triangles, the Swartzentruber use a gray reflective
tape and a lantern on the rear of their buggies. Gray or white tape
is legal for use on slow-moving vehicles in nine states, including
Ohio, where the sect had lived.</TE>
<TE>   The state Senate has approved a bill to let the Swartzentruber
substitute the gray reflective tape and a lantern.</TE>

<HD>Senate OKs $31.5-Billion Anti-Terrorism Package</HD>
<DH>Spending: Republicans hope to reduce the price tag during
negotiations with House members.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate gave strong approval early today to a counter-terrorism
bill costing more than $31.5 billion, ignoring a White House veto
threat and setting up a politically tinged showdown over the price
tag for domestic security.</LD>
<LD>   After four days of debate, senators approved the legislation by a
vote of 71 to 22, despite objections by the Bush administration and
many Republicans that it was too expensive. The post-midnight vote
followed a testy final flurry in which a few dozen amendments were
accepted but scores of others were dropped over the angry protests of
several senators.</LD>
<LD>   Passage came hours after President Bush announced his proposal to
merge federal anti-terrorism efforts into a Cabinet-level Department
of Homeland Security and declared that America was waging "a titanic
struggle against terror."</LD>
<TE>   With that backdrop, Senate Republican leaders decided against
dragging debate into next week on a package laden with funds for U.S.
troops, airport safety and other popular initiatives. Instead, they
will count on upcoming House-Senate negotiations on a final version
to pare it or produce a bill that Bush would veto--just as this
year's campaigns for congressional control are ramping up.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly the bill has gotten out of control," said Senate Minority
Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), but "to just drag this out into next
week would not be a positive thing."</TE>
<TE>   Bush proposed a $27.1-billion anti-terrorism package in March, and
the House approved a $29-billion bill in May. The spending is for the
remaining months of the federal budget year that ends Sept. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats chided GOP critics of the bill, which mostly contains
funds for the military, FBI, efforts to thwart cyber- and
bioterrorism, and other responses to the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell your people back home they don't need this protection," said
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va).
"Tell them, don't tell us."</TE>
<TE>   Sens. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) and John McCain (R-Ariz.)
unsuccessfully offered a series of amendments to underline their
point that piggybacked onto the bill were pet projects and other
items that were not dire emergencies. They also argued that the
appropriations panel included projects that were scheduled for next
year to ease a budget crunch expected then.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the Senate time and again refused to strip items from the
legislation, underlining the Appropriations Committee's power and
Congress' long tradition of attaching parochial items to must-pass
bills.</TE>
<TE>   By 65 to 31, the Senate refused to remove language providing $2.5
million for mapping Hawaiian coral reefs. Supporters of the funds
said the provision steered money approved last year to an effort to
protect endangered ocean life, but Gramm and McCain said the
provision showed how some lawmakers were misusing the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate also rebuffed by 66 to 30 an effort to remove $2
million to help the Smithsonian Institution plan a storage facility
for its animal specimens.</TE>
<TE>   Working through a stack of amendments, senators voted 75 to 19 to
forbid U.S. cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal, a
permanent court that starts operations next month and has been
opposed by the president. The House has approved a nearly identical
ban.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate boosted the bill's cost a bit by voting 79 to 14 for a
proposal by Sens. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) to
double to $200 million the bill's funds for fighting AIDS overseas. A
Democratic effort to boost the total to $500 million was rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Gramm also blocked inclusion of a bipartisan deal reached among
some top senators that would have set a cap on next year's spending
and set procedures for enforcing that limit. The figure--which
excludes benefits such as Social Security--was $768 billion, $9
billion more than Bush proposed and $29 billion higher than is to be
spent this year.</TE>
<TE>   Many lawmakers want such an agreement because bipartisan fights
have blocked passage of a congressional budget this year that would
limit spending. But Gramm and other conservatives want to hold out
for a lower figure.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-terrorism bill contains $5.5 billion to help New York's
recovery from the World Trade Center destruction, $200 million for
Israel, $50 million for humanitarian aid to Palestinians and $100
million to fight AIDS in poor nations.</TE>

<HD>Bush Proposes a Cabinet-Level Homeland Security Department</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: His reorganization would create a $37.4-billion
office to defend the nation against attack. It combines elements of
many agencies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Under strong pressure from Congress, President Bush on Thursday
proposed creating a Cabinet-level department to oversee homeland
defense, with sweeping authority to protect the nation's borders,
ensure airline security and respond to national emergencies.</LD>
<LD>   Bush unveiled his plan in a televised speech from the White House,
saying the new agency would make the nation safer by eliminating
security gaps and overlaps in the patchwork government system now
responsible for protecting against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   "Right now, as many as a hundred different government agencies
have some responsibilities for homeland security, and no one has
final accountability," he said.</LD>
<TE>   He asked Congress to pass legislation to "unite essential agencies
that must work more closely together."</TE>
<TE>   The president's proposal represents a sharp turn in policy
direction, coming only after Bush's creation of a homeland defense
office inside the White House staff--and outside of congressional
oversight--prompted a tense struggle with Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed Department of Homeland Security would annex agencies
within eight Cabinet departments, including the Border Patrol, Coast
Guard, Immigration and Naturalization Service and the newly created
Transportation Security Administration. Bush's top advisor on
homeland defense, former Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, is likely to
be nominated as the department's secretary.</TE>
<TE>   If approved by Congress, the overhaul of security responsibilities
would be the largest reorganization of the government since 1947,
when the Department of Defense was created. The agency would become
the third-largest Cabinet department--and the first new one since the
creation of the Department of Veterans Affairs in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "Our government must be reorganized to deal more effectively with
the new threats of the 21st century," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional leaders generally applauded the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), who chairs the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, said, "The sooner we can get this new
department created, and thereby raise our guard against terrorist
attacks, the better."</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman had been one of the most vocal in urging the
administration to create the department, and his support will be
important in pushing the Senate to approve the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as Tuesday, House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt
(D-Mo.) had also called for such action.</TE>
<TE>   But winning congressional approval by the end of the year may pose
a challenge to the administration.</TE>
<TE>   Each existing agency that it would incorporate has supporters in
Congress, as well as often-powerful interest groups that support it,
and the administration will have to consult with turf-conscious
leaders of several dozen committees and subcommittees from both
parties.</TE>
<TE>   Reference to Titanic</TE>
<TE>   After Bush's speech, Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) said he hopes
the measure "amounts to more than just reshuffling the deck chairs on
the Titanic."</TE>
<TE>   The goal of the reorganization is to give one agency full
responsibility for protecting the nation against attack, to avoid the
gaps in coordination and the lack of cooperation by government
offices that let crucial information fall through the cracks.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed department would have responsibility in four areas:</TE>
<TE>   * Protecting the nation's borders and the security of the
transportation network, primarily airplanes and ships.</TE>
<TE>   * Preparing the nation for emergencies and directing the responses
to them.</TE>
<TE>   * Providing medical measures and other steps to counter the
effects of attacks by chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   * Analyzing intelligence on potential threats and protecting vital
elements of American life, including food and water, health services,
transportation networks, communications, banking and energy.</TE>
<TE>   As the White House was putting the finishing touches on its plan
and notifying members of Congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee was
beginning a public inquiry into the government's failures to make
connections with intelligence reports that may have foretold the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's announcement was widely seen as an effort to shift the
public spotlight from those deficiencies to Bush's proposal to
correct them.</TE>
<TE>   Bush acknowledged in his speech that before Sept. 11, "the
suspicions and insights of some of our front-line agents did not get
enough attention."</TE>
<TE>   "I do not believe anyone could have prevented the horror of Sept.
11," he said. "Yet we now know that thousands of trained killers are
plotting to attack us, and this terrible knowledge requires us to act
differently."</TE>
<TE>   He went so far as to tell FBI and CIA agents that if something
raises their suspicions, "report it immediately." And in a clear
reference to the FBI's failures to coordinate disparate reports of
possible terrorist activity last summer, he told supervisors to treat
such information in the future "with the seriousness it deserves."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed office would reach into disparate areas--taking, for
example, the Secret Service from the Treasury Department, where it
has been since 1865, and the animal and plant inspection service from
the Agriculture Department--to create a single agency responsible for
the broad sweep of security functions performed by the federal
government.</TE>
<TE>   Included would be the Border Patrol, now an agency in the
Department of Justice, and the Coast Guard, from the Department of
Transportation. The immigration component would be taken from Justice
and also would assume some of the State Department's visa work.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Emergency Management Agency, now an independent body,
also would become part of the department.</TE>
<TE>   However, while the new department would depend heavily on
intelligence from the FBI and the CIA, those agencies would remain
largely untouched by the reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   "This new department will review intelligence and law enforcement
information from all agencies of government and produce a single
daily picture of threats against our homeland," Bush said in his
11-minute address. "Analysts will be responsible for imagining the
worst and planning to counter it."</TE>
<TE>   He likened the measures to the sweep of those initiated by
President Truman after World War II, when the focus was fighting the
Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we need similar dramatic reforms to secure our people at
home," Bush said. "We face an urgent need, and we must move quickly."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed department would have 169,000 employees--only the
departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs are larger--and would
have a budget of $37.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The White House argued that, because existing agencies were being
transferred to a new department but no new individual agencies were
being created, the changes were unlikely to raise the budget and
expand the government payroll.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not trying to uproot and destroy. We're trying to build a
new department to better protect the homeland," said Gordon Johndroe,
Ridge's spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   But Michael O'Hanlon, a scholar at the Brookings Institution, a
nonpartisan public policy center in Washington, questioned whether
simply shuffling agencies into one department would have any effect.</TE>
<TE>   'All About ... Money'</TE>
<TE>   "We need to remember that nobody in Washington is actually
protecting the country; this is all about making decisions and
allocating money," O'Hanlon said.</TE>
<TE>   In the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, the White
House said Bush opposed creating a separate department to handle such
defense issues.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 2, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was asked
whether Bush was open to discussing with Congress the possibility of
creating a department to handle homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   "No," he replied.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, he said the president had opposed such a move at the
time because the quickest way to meet the most pressing needs was to
create an Office of Homeland Security in the White House rather than
taking the time needed to win congressional approval to build a new
department.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>This is the text of President Bush's speech, as transcribed by
eMediaMillWorks Inc.:</LD>
<LD>   Good evening.</LD>
<LD>   During the next few minutes, I want to update you on the progress
we are making in our war against terror and to propose sweeping
changes that will strengthen our homeland against the ongoing threat
of terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly nine months have passed since the day that forever changed
our country. Debris from what was once the World Trade Center has
been cleared away in 100,000 truckloads. The west side of the
Pentagon looks almost as it did on Sept. 10. And as children finish
school and families prepare for summer vacations, for many, life
seems almost normal.</TE>
<TE>   Yet we are a different nation today--sadder and stronger, less
innocent and more courageous, more appreciative of life and, for many
who serve our country, more willing to risk life in a great cause.</TE>
<TE>   For those who have lost family and friends, the pain will never go
away, and neither will the responsibilities that day thrust upon all
of us. America is leading the civilized world in a titanic struggle
against terror. Freedom and fear are at war. And freedom is winning.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, over 60,000 American troops are deployed around the world
in the war against terror--more than 7,000 in Afghanistan, others in
the Philippines, Yemen and the Republic of Georgia to train local
forces.</TE>
<TE>   Next week, Afghanistan will begin selecting a representative
government, even as American troops, along with our allies, still
continuously raid remote Al Qaeda hiding places.</TE>
<TE>   Among those we have captured is a man named Abu Subaydah, Al
Qaeda's chief of operations. From him and from hundreds of others, we
are learning more about how the terrorists plan and operate,
information crucial in anticipating and preventing future attacks.</TE>
<TE>   When credible intelligence warrants, appropriate law enforcement
and local officials are alerted. These warnings are, unfortunately, a
new reality in American life and we have recently seen an increase in
the volume of general threats.</TE>
<TE>   Americans should continue to do what you're doing. Go about your
lives, but pay attention to your surroundings. Add your eyes and ears
to the protection of our homeland.</TE>
<TE>   In protecting our country, we depend on the skill of our people:
the troops we send to battle, intelligence operatives who risk their
lives for bits of information, law enforcement officers who sift for
clues and search for suspects. We are now learning that before Sept.
11, the suspicions and insights of some of our front-line agents did
not get enough attention.</TE>
<TE>   My administration supports the important work of the intelligence
committees in Congress, to review the activities of law enforcement
and intelligence agencies. We need to know when warnings were missed
or signs unheeded, not to point the finger of blame, but to make sure
we correct any problems and prevent them from happening again.</TE>
<TE>   Based on everything I've seen, I do not believe anyone could have
prevented the horror of Sept. 11. Yet we now know that thousands of
trained killers are plotting to attack us, and this terrible
knowledge requires us to act differently.</TE>
<TE>   If you're a front-line worker for the FBI, the CIA, some other law
enforcement or intelligence agency and you see something that raises
suspicions, I want you to report it immediately. I expect your
supervisors to treat it with the seriousness it deserves. Information
must be fully shared so we can follow every lead to find the one that
may prevent tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   I applaud the leaders and employees at the FBI and CIA for
beginning essential reforms. They must continue to think and act
differently to defeat the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   The first and best way to secure America's homeland is to attack
the enemy where he hides and plans, and we're doing just that.</TE>
<TE>   We're also taking significant steps to strengthen our homeland
protections: securing cockpits, tightening our borders, stockpiling
vaccines, increasing security at water treatment and nuclear power
plants.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, we needed to move quickly, and so I appointed Tom
Ridge as my homeland security advisor. As Gov. Ridge has worked with
all levels of government to prepare a national strategy, and as we
have learned more about the plans and capabilities of the terrorist
network, we have concluded that our government must be reorganized to
deal more effectively with the new threats of the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   So tonight, I ask the Congress to join me in creating a single,
permanent department with an overriding and urgent mission: securing
the homeland of America and protecting the American people.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, as many as 100 different government agencies have some
responsibilities for homeland security, and no one has final
accountability.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the Coast Guard has several missions, from search and
rescue to maritime treaty enforcement. It reports to the
Transportation Department, whose primary responsibilities are roads,
rails, bridges and the airways.</TE>
<TE>   The Customs Service, among other duties, collects tariffs and
prevents smuggling, and it is part of the Treasury Department, whose
primary responsibility is fiscal policy, not security.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, I propose a permanent Cabinet-level Department of
Homeland Security to unite essential agencies that must work more
closely together--among them, the Coast Guard, the Border Patrol, the
Customs Service, immigration officials, the Transportation Security
Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Employees of this new agency will come to work every morning
knowing their most important job is to protect their fellow citizens.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Homeland Security will be charged with four
primary tasks. This new agency will control our borders and prevent
terrorists and explosives from entering our country. It will work
with state and local authorities to respond quickly and effectively
to emergencies. It will bring together our best scientists to develop
technologies that detect biological, chemical and nuclear weapons,
and to discover the drugs and treatments to best protect our
citizens.</TE>
<TE>   And this new department will review intelligence and law
enforcement information from all agencies of government and produce a
single daily picture of threats against our homeland. Analysts will
be responsible for imagining the worst and planning to counter it.</TE>
<TE>   The reason to create this department is not to [increase] the size
of government, but to increase its focus and effectiveness. The staff
of this new department will be largely drawn from the agencies we are
combining. By ending duplication and overlap, we will spend less on
overhead and more on protecting America.</TE>
<TE>   This reorganization will give the good people of our government
their best opportunity to succeed by organizing our resources in a
way that is thorough and unified.</TE>
<TE>   What I'm proposing tonight is the most extensive reorganization of
the federal government since the 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   During his presidency, Harry Truman recognized that our nation's
fragmented defenses had to be reorganized to win the Cold War. He
proposed uniting our military forces under a single Department of
Defense, and creating the National Security Council to bring together
defense, intelligence and diplomacy.</TE>
<TE>   Truman's reforms are still helping us to fight terror abroad. And
now we need similar dramatic reforms to secure our people at home.</TE>
<TE>   Only the United States Congress can create a new department of
government. So tonight, I ask for your help in encouraging your
representatives to support my plan.</TE>
<TE>   We face an urgent need. And we must move quickly, this year,
before the end of the congressional session.</TE>
<TE>   All in our government have learned a great deal since Sept. 11,
and we must act on every lesson. We are stronger and better prepared
tonight than we were on that terrible morning.</TE>
<TE>   And with your help, and the support of the Congress, we will be
stronger still.</TE>
<TE>   History has called our nation into action. History has placed a
great challenge before us. Will America, with our unique position in
power, blink in the face of terror, or will we lead to a freer, more
civilized world?</TE>
<TE>   There's only one answer. This great country will lead the world to
safety, security, peace and freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Thank you for listening, good night, and may God bless America.</TE>

<HD>Backstreet Boy Goes Before Senate Panel</HD>
<DH>Environment: Kevin Richardson testifies on damage from
mining in his native Kentucky.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Kevin Richardson of the Backstreet Boys shared his
concerns about a coal mining practice with a Senate panel Thursday,
and one lawmaker said she would accept the singer's offer of an
aerial tour to see the environmental effects.</LD>
<LD>   "When I move back home to Kentucky to raise a family on my farm, I
want my kids to be able to fish and swim in the same places I grew
up," said Richardson, who is in an environmental group called Just
Within Reach.</LD>
<LD>   He testified about mountaintop mining, a practice in which the top
of a ridge or mountain is sheared off to expose a coal seam. Dirt and
rock waste then is pushed into nearby valleys and waterways. Critics
say the Bush administration is undercutting environmental laws with a
rule encouraging such mining.</LD>
<TE>   "I am not a scientist, but I know what I've seen in flights over
the coal fields," Richardson told the Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee.</TE>
<TE>   He invited members to join him on a flight to see the affected
areas, and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) said she would accept
his offer.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) defended his invitation to
Richardson, whose testimony was criticized by one committee member.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Richardson is here as more than a well-known celebrity,"
Lieberman said. "He is knowledgeable on this issue and has in fact
worked to protect the environment in his home state. I believe his
voice will add to our understanding of the issue."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. George Voinovich (R-Ohio) boycotted the hearing to protest
the recent parade of celebrities to Capitol Hill, which has included
Julia Roberts and Christie Brinkley.</TE>
<TE>   "I object to those that are brought in for show business,"
Voinovich said when contacted after the hearing. "This witness was
put in as an afterthought because someone thought it would add to the
glamour of the hearing and attract media attention."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Voinovich said it was a "joke" to think that Richardson
could provide senators with information on important geological and
water-quality issues.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate that he's not here. I could have taught him
something," Richardson said.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson said drawing the media was his intention.</TE>
<TE>   "That's entirely what I am here for. I am going to help
mountaintop mining to be stopped," he said. "But to say that I am not
educated on the issues and that I don't have anything to add to the
issue is wrong. I have every right to be here."</TE>

<HD>A Pragmatic Bush Claims Cause as His Own</HD>
<DH>Strategy: President's decision to reverse course on Cabinet
post catches many off guard. But keeping an open mind on issues has
paid off for him in the past.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN and JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush's decision to create a Department of
Homeland Security took much of Washington by surprise. It shouldn't
have.</LD>
<LD>   His move to preempt Congress and embrace as his own a cause that
he previously had resisted is a strategy that Bush used to good
advantage time and again while governor of Texas.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a well-established modus operandi," said Bruce Buchanan, a
University of Texas political scientist and longtime Bush watcher.</LD>
<TE>   More than that, White House opposition to a Cabinet department
visibly began to mellow in late April amid reports that the nation's
intelligence community may have missed vital clues before the Sept.
11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Yet until Thursday, most members of Congress had the impression
that the president remained dead set against the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "It came like a Nebraska spring thunderstorm--all of a sudden it
was there," Sen. Charles Hagel (R-Neb.) said of Bush's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   When Bush named Tom Ridge as his homeland security advisor last
fall, he steadfastly distanced himself from the bipartisan clamor in
Congress to create a domestic security agency to house all the parts
of the federal bureaucracy charged with protecting America and
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer provided an unequivocal
answer at his Oct. 2 news briefing when asked whether the president
was "open to a discussion" with Congress about legislation to make
Ridge's job a Cabinet post. Fleischer's reply: "No."</TE>
<TE>   A month later, White House officials circulated a flow chart
depicting a maze of lines and boxes to suggest that a major
reorganization would be too disruptive and politically difficult.</TE>
<TE>   But Fleischer on Thursday laid out a chronology that depicted the
administration as being open all along to a new Cabinet department.</TE>
<TE>   He quoted Ridge as telling lawmakers in late October that he "may
recommend down the road a realignment."</TE>
<TE>   Such words prompted lawmakers to delay acting on their proposals.
Among them were Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), Arlen Specter
(R-Pa.) and Bob Graham (D-Fla.) and Reps. Ellen O. Tauscher
(D-Alamo), Jane Harman (D-Venice) and William M. "Mac" Thornberry
(R-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   In the interim, the clamor for a Cabinet department escalated,
sparked by the White House's refusal to allow Ridge to testify before
Congress. As a Cabinet officer, Ridge would be obliged to testify,
but as an advisor to the president he was not.</TE>
<TE>   Ridge tried without much luck to appease his congressional critics
by submitting to questioning in informal settings short of an
official hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions mounted in the last few weeks as the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee approved a bipartisan bill to create a
Cabinet-level Homeland Security Department, and the Senate
Appropriations Committee included a proviso in an emergency spending
bill to make Ridge's job subject to Senate confirmation and to compel
him to testify.</TE>
<TE>   Within the last week, several lawmakers sponsoring legislation to
create the Cabinet department said the White House began to reach out
to them.</TE>
<TE>   But the enterprise remained low key and its details tightly held.
Republican leaders such as Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi and House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois were not
notified of Bush's announcement until Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Others were in the dark until Thursday morning, when the White
House and GOP leaders began circulating a blizzard of briefing papers
and talking points.</TE>
<TE>   But the signs of a White House change of heart had already been
apparent.</TE>
<TE>   On April 10, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., director of the Office of
Management and Budget, told the Senate governmental affairs panel
that "the structure for organizing and overseeing homeland security
may evolve over time" and that it ultimately might resemble
Lieberman's vision.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, Ridge and White House chief of staff Andrew H.
Card Jr. convened a meeting that launched the proposal of a
Cabinet-level position for homeland security chief that Bush unveiled
Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   "This was something that was discussed at length," Fleischer said,
with Ridge and Card briefing Bush throughout the decision-making
process.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer's public criticism of a Cabinet department began to
soften during this period. At his May 17 news briefing, he said:
"Congress has some different ideas about the possibility of creating
a Cabinet post, and we're looking at those ideas."</TE>
<TE>   A broader hint came earlier this week when the White House asked
Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) to delay until next week a hearing
on the subject by his subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   The effort grew out of a separate initiative to reorganize the
agencies that deal with border security. "That's when the president
... said we need to really take a look broadly at the total way we
protect our country," Fleischer recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Bush signed off on the final proposal in late May, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The White House initially had intended to have the reorganization
plan ready in time for the first anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.
But it was moved up in part to counter the congressional hearings now
underway, said one senior White House official who asked to remain
anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   "The pressure of the last three weeks of having to answer
increasingly embarrassing and tough questions about what the FBI
knew, what the CIA knew ... forced the issue," Tauscher said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure that's a part of it," Hagel added. "We all deal in a
real world here."</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time that Bush, either as president or as
governor, has demonstrated his pragmatic streak.</TE>
<TE>   As governor, for instance, he strenuously fought efforts to
require full parity for mental health in insurance coverage.</TE>
<TE>   But ultimately he signed a less-far-reaching bill that required
coverage parity only for serious mental illnesses, said Texas Rep.
Elliott Naishstat, a Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   As president, Bush claimed victory for education reform even
though it passed Congress only after he gave up vouchers--a
cornerstone of his agenda.</TE>
<TE>   In foreign affairs, Bush's most notable course reversal came on
the Middle East. Until spring, he steadfastly refused to intervene
diplomatically until the crisis reached a near-boiling point, leaving
him no choice but to get involved in peacemaking efforts there.</TE>

<HD>House OKs Estate Tax's Full Repeal</HD>
<DH>Congress: Levy was to be reinstated in 2011. Farm lobby had
backed the move, but opponents of the repeal insist that the U.S.
can't afford it.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Republican-led House on Thursday approved President Bush's
proposal to permanently repeal the estate tax, setting the stage for
a much tougher fight on the issue in the Democrat-controlled Senate.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, a top goal of the politically powerful farm lobby, would
extend the estate tax repeal that was approved last year as part of
Bush's sweeping $1.35-trillion, 10-year tax cut plan. Under that law,
the estate tax gradually decreases before ending in 2010. But on Jan.
1, 2011, the tax would return to its 2001 rates, under which the
largest estates would face a 55% levy.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Democratic leaders oppose the push to permanently repeal
the tax, saying the government cannot afford expanded tax cuts at a
time when budget deficits have returned and are growing.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the political momentum behind the bill is strong enough
that Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) has agreed to hold a
vote on it later this month.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle believes he has the votes to block the bill. But the issue
poses a tricky political choice for the many Democrats up for
reelection this year, especially those from the Farm Belt. Farm and
business groups plan a vigorous lobbying campaign on the bill's
behalf among senators, including running political advertisements in
states that have competitive Senate campaigns this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's House vote underscored the political crosscurrents: 41
Democrats broke ranks with party leaders and joined 214 Republicans
and one independent in approving the permanent repeal, 256 to 171.
Five California Democrats voted for the repeal, as did all of the
state's Republican House members.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is the inheritance tax paid by heirs. Any estate valued
at $1 million or less is exempt, so only a fraction of estates are
affected. In 1999, the most recent year for which figures are
available, 49,870 estates paid the tax. That included 7,445 in
California, more than in any other state.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the repeal bill stalls in the Senate, Republicans are
eager to spotlight it and other tax-cut initiatives as they fight to
hold on to their slim majority in the House and wrest control of the
Senate from Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "Time and time again we've shown tax relief is good policy and
good politics," House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas said in a
letter to GOP colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Next week, the House plans to take up permanent repeal of the
"marriage penalty," a quirk in law that often causes married couples
filing jointly to pay more taxes than if they filed as individuals.</TE>
<TE>   The tax cut law passed last year would reduce the marriage penalty
during the next decade. But as with the estate tax, these cuts expire
in 2011.</TE>
<TE>   "Republicans hope to use the [tax cut] issue to mobilize their
base, particularly in farm states," where they will focus on the
estate tax, said Marshall Wittmann, a political expert at the
conservative Hudson Institute think tank in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers and owners of small businesses particularly are strong
proponents of ending the estate tax because, in some instances, heirs
have had to liquidate family farms or businesses to pay the levies.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Hammonds, president and chief executive of the Food Marketing
Institute and chairman of a coalition called Americans Against Unfair
Family Taxation, said permanent repeal would free more than 5 million
family businesses and households "from the burden of spending
billions of dollars a year in estate planning and special life
insurance to avoid or cover the tax. And it frees those billions [of
dollars] to stimulate the economy at a time when we need it most."</TE>
<TE>   Unless Congress makes the repeal permanent, a GOP report on the
bill says, "those who are fortunate enough to die in the year 2010
will pay no estate tax, while the unfortunate individual who lives
one extra day and dies on Jan. 1, 2011, will face a devastating
estate tax of up to 55%."</TE>
<TE>   Government estimates show that permanently repealing the estate
tax would cost the U.S. Treasury about $25 billion in 2011,
increasing to $56 billion in 2012.</TE>
<TE>   The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities projects that
the government would lose about $740 billion in revenue from 2013 to
2022, but Republicans contend that economic growth from repeal would
make up for lost revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "Only in our government are you given a certificate at birth, a
license at marriage and a bill at death," Rep. Sam Johnson (R-Texas)
said in arguing for the repeal bill.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents included Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who said
the measure would primarily benefit a small, wealthy segment of the
population.</TE>
<TE>   "This bill is not about protecting family farms and small
businesses, it's about doing favors for well-connected campaign
contributors, like [former] Enron CEO Ken Lay," Waxman said.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) suggested it would be
unpatriotic to permanently repeal the estate tax. "It would seem to
me that, if we are going to ask for sacrifice, it should include
asking the wealthiest one-half of 1% of Americans to pay taxes as
they have even under Ronald Reagan."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats proposed an alternative that would have raised the
estate exemption to $3 million for individuals and $6 million for
couples by the beginning of next year. But that measure was rejected.</TE>
<TE>   The California Democrats who voted for the permanent repeal were
Lois Capps of Santa Barbara, Gary A. Condit of Ceres, Calvin M.
Dooley of Visalia, Jane Harman of Venice and Mike Thompson of St.
Helena.</TE>

<HD>Harvard Student Gives Protested 'Jihad' Talk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.</DL>
<LD>On a rain-drenched commencement day at Harvard Yard, a Muslim
American student Thursday urged his fellow graduates to shape "a more
just, peaceful and honorable global society"--and referred repeatedly
to "jihad" as he did so.</LD>
<LD>   Thus, Zayed Yasin, 22, a biomedical engineering student, delivered
the speech whose original title--"American Jihad"--ignited a
controversy that included a campus-wide debate over free speech, a
petition opposing his selection as one of three student speakers at
Harvard's 351st commencement and an e-mailed death threat against
him. Yasin changed his title to "Of Faith and Citizenship" and
heightened some references to the Sept. 11 attacks, but his text
remained largely intact.</LD>
<LD>   "I am one of you. But I am also one of 'them,' " he said, opening
his remarks by referring to his dual identities as a practicing
Muslim and American citizen and their perceived contradictions. He
said he chose the word "struggle" deliberately and went on to condemn
misuse of the Arabic term.</LD>
<TE>   Yasin's choice of the word, which also has been defined as "holy
war" and used by Muslim fundamentalists to justify terrorism, had led
some to denounce him as a terrorist sympathizer. But the former
Harvard Islamic Society president received the continued backing of
university President Lawrence Summers.</TE>
<TE>   As he finished his speech, Yasin, the son of a Bangladeshi father
and Irish American mother, looked relieved to have the dispute and
four years at Harvard behind him.</TE>
<TE>   A number of audience members, including an entire section of
students, rose to give him a standing ovation, while others whooped
in support. Scores of other students wore red, white and blue ribbons
to express their opposition to the speech.</TE>

<HD>Wrecked Helicopter Pulled Off Mt. Hood</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOOD RIVER, Ore.</DL>
<LD>HOOD RIVER, Ore. -- A wrecked helicopter was removed from Mt. Hood on
Thursday morning, a week after the Pave Hawk HH-60G crashed while a
crew aboard was attempting to airlift a survivor from a deadly
climbing accident.</LD>
<LD>   An Oregon Army National Guard CH-47 Chinook, a larger helicopter
with twin rotor blades, used a harness and a 200-foot cable to pluck
the Pave Hawk off the snowy slopes of the mountain and carry it away.</LD>
<LD>   The Pave Hawk, which weighs about 15,000 pounds, was set down
about 15 minutes later in the parking lot of the White River
Sno-Park.</LD>
<TE>   Air Force Master Sgt. Bud McKay said the removal went off without
a hitch.</TE>
<TE>   The battered fuselage will eventually be transported to the air
base at Portland International Airport, a spokesman for the Air
Force's 939th Rescue Wing said.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinook returned to the mountain to pick up other debris, and
returned to the parking lot with a large basket filled with
helicopter parts, including the rotors that sheared off when the
chopper crashed and rolled down the slope.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Col. Dan Grussick said no more debris would be brought down
Thursday. He said the parts were widely scattered over the mountain,
and that the Forest Service would do an environmental assessment to
determine the risks of retrieving more.</TE>
<TE>   Grussick said the most dangerous part of Thursday's operation was
hooking up slings to the upside-down helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   "It was unstable and resting on a steep slope," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nine climbers fell into a crevasse about 800 feet from the summit
of Mt. Hood on May 30. Three died in the accident.</TE>

<HD>Bureaucracy Is Hobbling the FBI, Rowley Testifies</HD>
<DH>Intelligence: Agent's letter put the bureau's Sept. 11
failures under a microscope. She tells senators 'roadblocks' stymie
terrorism fight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Coleen Rowley, the veteran Minneapolis FBI agent whose scathing
critique of her bosses has made her a hero, told rapt lawmakers
Thursday in her first public appearance that the FBI's "ever-growing
bureaucracy" has stymied the hunt for terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   "We need a way to get around the roadblocks," Rowley told members
of the Senate Judiciary Committee in a two-hour appearance that
ranged from folksy observations about a field agent's life to
condemnation of FBI headquarters in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Rowley, an Iowa native who speaks with a heartland twang,
acknowledged that she never imagined she would be thrust in the
middle of the national terrorism debate when she spent three
sleepless nights last month drafting a letter about missteps in the
FBI's handling of suspected "20th hijacker" Zacarias Moussaoui.</LD>
<TE>   But by Thursday, as she told her story publicly for the first time
after nearly two weeks in seclusion, she had become the darling of
FBI-bashers demanding top-to-bottom changes in the embattled bureau.</TE>
<TE>   Rowley, 47, has had private audiences this week with senators and
FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III. Justice Department investigators
probing intelligence failures surrounding Sept. 11 are waiting to
hear her allegations, and hundreds of current and former FBI agents
have e-mailed and called her with words of support for giving voice
to frustrations many said they shared.</TE>
<TE>   Rowley was mobbed by photographers as she took her seat at the
witness table in one of the Senate's ornate hearing rooms, where she
was fawned over by lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "Agent Rowley is a patriotic American who had the courage to put
truth first and raise critical but important questions about how the
FBI handled a terrorist case before the attacks, and about the FBI's
cultural problems," said Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa).</TE>
<TE>   During the hearing, senators wanted her input on everything from
"careerism" and computer woes at the FBI to President Bush's plans to
restructure homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   Rowley, a 21-year veteran agent who also serves as general counsel
in the FBI's Minneapolis field office, begged off commenting about
some of the bigger topics that went beyond her pay grade. But she was
anxious to lay the blame for investigative missteps on bureaucratic
ineptitude.</TE>
<TE>   A "don't-rock-the-boat" mentality has stifled aggressive police
work, she said, and a reorganization plan unveiled last week in
Washington to add still more levels of oversight to the FBI's
nine-layer counter-terrorism bureaucracy threatens more of the same.</TE>
<TE>   "Why create more [layers]? It's not going to be an answer," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   In her now-famous May 21 letter to Mueller, Rowley complained that
after Moussaoui was picked up on an immigration violation in August
because of his suspicious activities at a flight school, FBI agents
in Minneapolis strongly suspected that he was a terrorist. But their
efforts to get a secret intelligence warrant to search his belongings
and laptop computer were rebuffed by FBI supervisors in Washington
who did not think they had a strong enough case, she said.</TE>
<TE>   A later search of Moussaoui's computer and other items produced a
flight-simulation program, information about crop-dusters and other
suspicious material. Authorities now believe he was meant to be the
"20th hijacker" in the strikes against the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon, and he is facing the death penalty on conspiracy and
terrorism charges in connection with the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   A few hours before Rowley's testimony, Mueller sat at the same
hearing room table, but his appearance drew a much harsher welcome,
as members of the judiciary panel grilled him about allegations
contained in Rowley's letter and questioned his response to it.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller, who began his job at the FBI a week before the Sept. 11
attacks, said he did not want to second-guess the earlier decision by
FBI headquarters not to seek a warrant against Moussaoui.</TE>
<TE>   But Mueller acknowledged that mistakes were made in the
case--including the failure to consider it side-by-side with a
warning weeks earlier from a Phoenix agent about suspicious Middle
Eastern flight students.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller said he already has changed the system for reviews of such
warrants, and that an FBI lawyer believed that, had the Phoenix memo
been considered along with the Minneapolis case, "it would have made
a difference" in the decision on whether to seek a warrant against
Moussaoui.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, several senators said the FBI's performance last summer
may have been disastrous.</TE>
<TE>   "Had the FBI been totally alert and had the FBI used its current
capabilities to the best of its ability, there was at least a very
good chance that the terrorist plot could have been uncovered," said
Sen. Herbert Kohl (D-Wis.).</TE>
<TE>   Mueller--whom the Wall Street Journal said last week should
resign--received votes of confidence from several senators, and
Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) told the former San Francisco prosecutor
that she sympathized with him.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Mueller, I suspect there are times you wish you were on the
West Coast, as I do.... This is a hard place," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But several other lawmakers attacked Mueller for his refusal to
say whether Bush had consulted him about the White House plan to
restructure the homeland defense system.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller also faced criticism about the seeming indifference of his
boss, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, to consulting with Congress
concerning a recent series of counter-terrorism measures, including a
plan to register and fingerprint foreigners who may pose a national
security risk.</TE>
<TE>   That plan has stirred concerns from civil libertarians about
racial profiling of Muslims. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) asked
Mueller how the FBI could expect to recruit more Arab-speaking FBI
agents as it targets Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   "What impact do you think these policies will have on the Arab and
Muslim communities in the U.S. if you're holding job fairs in the
morning and fingerprinting them in the afternoon?" Kennedy asked.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller said the FBI will be careful not to trample on anyone's
constitutional rights.</TE>
<TE>   "I still believe that we have to protect the freedoms that we have
in this country that are guaranteed by the Constitution, or all the
work we do to protect it will be at naught," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller also assured members of the Senate Judiciary Committee
that he "will not tolerate" any attempts at the bureau to intimidate
or retaliate against Rowley for her outspoken comments.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents are exempted from the full safeguards of the
Whistleblower Protection Act, and some of Rowley's supporters were
concerned about her future because of a somewhat noncommittal
response Ashcroft gave last weekend when asked in a television
interview whether Rowley might be dismissed. The Justice Department
moved to "clarify" those remarks in a letter to Judiciary Committee
members, saying that Rowley would face "no retaliation" for her
letter.</TE>
<TE>   Rowley said she had good reason to worry about her job. "I know in
the FBI you don't venture close to criticizing a superior without
really running some risk. But in this case, actually, I was
pleasantly surprised that ... I've been promised repeatedly no
retaliation. And I want to hope that that kind of atmosphere now
starts to kind of take over and that people make decisions" without
fear of reprisal, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Rowley said she sympathizes with the "extremely difficult job"
Mueller faces. And she said that, while Mueller's plans to centralize
counter-terrorism operations in Washington may only compound some of
the bureaucratic problems, she believes he has made a sincere start
in changing a culture at the FBI that often discourages ingenuity.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what she would do to address the problems cited in her
letter, Rowley said: "You know, that is the $100-million
question--how to reduce bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   "Give me another week," she said, laughing. "I really can't
pretend to understand. I know Director Mueller is also very cognizant
of this problem. He iterated today that there are eight levels [of
supervisors] before you get to him. This is an unwieldy situation. If
there is a way to somehow reduce the level, I think that's the way we
need to go. Seven to nine levels is really ridiculous."</TE>

<HD>Possible Suspect in Utah Girl's Kidnap Pursued</HD>
<DH>Crime: Searchers in Salt Lake City spot someone fitting
description of the 14-year-old's abductor.</DH>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>After a day of frustrating dead ends, authorities late Thursday night
were tracking a possible suspect in the kidnapping of a 14-year-old
girl from her bedroom.</LD>
<LD>   Volunteer searchers deep in a canyon in the hills behind the
teen's home glimpsed a man who fit the description of the kidnapper
around 6 p.m. PDT. The man fled, searchers said, then soon after they
heard gunshots.</LD>
<LD>   The volunteers moved back down Emigration Canyon, and deputies
formed a human cordon around the area along with search dogs,
according to sheriff's spokeswoman Peggy Faulkner.</LD>
<TE>   With darkness deepening, a helicopter fitted with heat-sensing
infrared equipment was sent about 9 p.m. PDT.</TE>
<TE>   The searchers, many of them teenagers, remained at the bottom of
the popular recreational canyon, keeping vigil. Official vehicles
sped past them, carrying backcountry SWAT teams, trained to negotiate
difficult terrain in the dark.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, all we have is a suspicious person," Faulkner
said.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first break in the puzzling case. Earlier in the day
police said they had received thousands of telephone tips from
throughout the country, but none brought them closer to identifying a
suspect in the predawn kidnapping of Elizabeth Ann Smart on
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   No one, including the parents, has been ruled out as a suspect,
said Salt Lake City Police Chief Rick Dinse. "The family has been
very cooperative in just about every area you could imagine," he
added.</TE>
<TE>   More than a thousand volunteers fanned out Thursday in the upscale
neighborhood and in the foothills and canyons near the home where the
teen was kidnapped at gunpoint. Investigators sorted through possible
leads.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot more information--a lot of things that have not
panned out," Dinse said.</TE>
<TE>   There was no known motive for the kidnapping, he said, nor was it
known whether Elizabeth was targeted or randomly snatched from her
home.</TE>
<TE>   He said there was no indication that the abductor had previously
visited the house, which is for sale for $1.19 million. Interviews of
people who toured the house in recent weeks provided no clues, Dinse
said.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,300 volunteers, scores of journalists, and city and state
officials converged Thursday morning at Shriner's Hospital, just a
few blocks from the family home. The hospital lawns became a staging
area for the search.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers included teenagers on inline skates who taped orange
fliers on street posts, men in business suits who said they were too
distracted to work and housewives in hiking boots who combed through
vegetation for evidence.</TE>
<TE>   A young woman from Norway who had been in Salt Lake City since the
Winter Olympics said she was caught up in the community's response to
the kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have children, but I have sisters," Stine Hellerud said.
"Even though I don't live here, I felt like I had to help and maybe
make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   Kathie Curtis, a mother of five, joined the search in part because
a friend was kidnapped, sexually assaulted and killed 19 years ago in
the same area.</TE>
<TE>   "At that time, there was no mechanism for searching. There was
nothing we could do. I felt so helpless," Curtis said. "This
triggered all my memories of that."</TE>
<TE>   Searchers were instructed to place orange tape around anything
that looked suspicious in the hills, as they walked, red-faced, on
the hot afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Dunn said he caught his breath when he saw a white cap,
similar to what the kidnapper was said to be wearing. Looking closer,
he said, he realized it had been discarded months earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "I did a lot of bushwhacking and didn't find much except two big
rattlesnakes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth's parents, Edward and Lois Smart, appearing stressed and
exhausted, pleaded for their daughter's safe return.</TE>
<TE>   "We just can't even fathom who it is or why they took her," Edward
Smart, a real estate and mortgage broker, told CNN. "She's as near
perfect as a daughter can be. She plays the harp. She loved everyone.
I don't know of any enemies that she has, or any people who would
want to harm her."</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth was taken about 2 a.m. Wednesday after the abductor
apparently entered the three-story house through an unlocked window.
The parents and all six of their children were asleep in the home.</TE>
<TE>   The kidnapper entered the bedroom shared by Elizabeth and her
9-year-old sister and ordered the younger girl to remain quiet or
Elizabeth would be hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth was taken away wearing her red satin pajamas after she
was allowed to grab a pair of shoes.</TE>
<TE>   The younger girl ran and told her parents two hours later, and
they called police. She described the kidnapper as a soft-spoken
white man, 5 feet, 8 inches, with dark hair. She said the kidnapper
was wearing a light-colored denim-type jacket and a white baseball
cap.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned that police were slow to react, Ed Smart called church
friends Wednesday morning for help.</TE>
<TE>   "Ed said he felt the police weren't responding fast enough," said
David C. Hamblin, who leads the Arlington Hills ward of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. "He said they thought Elizabeth
was a runaway. He called three or four of us and got things started.
He said, 'We need some help here.' "</TE>
<TE>   Some church members who knew the family and who had connections
with the police department impressed upon detectives that the girl
was not likely to run away from home, Hamblin said.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the police for the first time used the Rachael Alert
system, named for a 3-year-old Utah girl who was kidnapped and found
dead in 1982. Under this new state policy, police investigating child
abductions notify local media, which then disseminate information
about the crime, including descriptions of the victim and the
abductor. Within 11 minutes, the information was broadcast on
television and radio during the morning rush hour.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Wednesday, forensics detectives searched the Smart
house for clues, including examining the family computer to see
whether the teenager had any online contact with strangers. More than
100 law enforcement officers fanned out across the nearby hills.
Tracking dogs were used, but they lost the girl's scent near the
home.</TE>
<TE>   An initial reward of $10,000 had swelled to $250,000 by Thursday.
"This is something that is affecting the entire community," Mayor
Rocky Anderson said. "This community is hurting."</TE>
<TE>   The abduction was similar to another recent kidnapping that
generated nationwide publicity.</TE>
<TE>   In February, 7-year-old Danielle van Dam was abducted from her San
Diego County home while her father was upstairs. Her body was found
three weeks later, and the suspect in her killing is now standing
trial.</TE>

<HD>Private Search Team Finds Bone in Park Believed to Be
Levy's</HD>
<DH>Crime: Part of a leg, covered by leaves, was near where
body was discovered. Official says it is 'consistent in every way'
with her remains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A pair of investigators working for Chandra Levy's family on Thursday
found a 12- to 14-inch bone near where the young woman's remains were
discovered in Rock Creek Park here, and the Washington medical
examiner said he believes it may be her missing tibia.</LD>
<LD>   Jonathan Arden, the medical examiner, said that the leg bone is
"consistent in every way" with the remains that were recovered two
weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   "It is in the same condition. And it is essentially the same size
as the right tibia, or shinbone, that we had," Arden said. "So my
working hypothesis is that it comes from Chandra."</LD>
<TE>   Arden has called the case a homicide, but said the new find shows
"no specific injury" that would lead him to change the cause of death
from "undetermined," the official conclusion he reached after
examining the skeletal remains and other evidence.</TE>
<TE>   The private investigators also found some twisted wire, possibly a
clothes hanger, not far from the bone. The wire was bent and had been
formed to resemble a figure eight, with two distinct loops.</TE>
<TE>   Police spent a week canvassing the area, a process that was
described as meticulous and was aimed at ensuring the recovery of as
much evidence as possible. The search continued day and night and at
various points involved police recruits, about 15 dogs, crime scene
technicians, anthropologists and an archeologist.</TE>
<TE>   But the possibility that a bone likely belonging to Levy was
somehow overlooked--and in proximity to where most of the remains
were found--raises questions about how thoroughly and systematically
the immediate scene was covered.</TE>
<TE>   Police initially downplayed the likelihood that the bone might be
Levy's, but Thursday night the department released a statement saying
the find was uncovered just 25 yards from where the young woman's
skull was found.</TE>
<TE>   The mobile crime unit was ordered back to the scene, and the area
was cordoned off and the search resumed.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unacceptable that these items were not located," Police
Chief Charles Ramsey said in the statement. "I have directed that
this matter be thoroughly reviewed to determine why these items were
not originally found."</TE>
<TE>   The two private detectives, who were hired by Levy family attorney
Billy Martin and were in the park Thursday accompanied by a reporter,
found the bone only about 50 feet from a cleared section of the park
where police looked for Levy's remains during a weeklong search of
the crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   The two former Washington homicide detectives, Joe McCann, 52, and
Duane Stanton, 43, were raking the area looking for evidence when
they found the bone and the wire. Both items were covered by leaves.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd think the cadaver dogs would have located it," Ramsey said
before Arden had identified the bone.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was a [body part], obviously we would have liked to have
found it. When we released the scene, we knew the left leg had not
been located. We were out there for a week. We did not find 100% of
the skeleton."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday morning, on WTOP radio's "Ask the Chief" program, Ramsey
said the mobile crime unit had done "an excellent, excellent job" of
investigating the area. "It's very difficult to search" the remote
thicket where the bones were found, he said. "That's why it took so
many days."</TE>
<TE>   Ramsey said that the wire found in the park may not be connected
to the crime scene, but instead might be wire used by the National
Park Service to support growing trees.</TE>

<HD>Imperiled Rio Grande Minnows Die</HD>
<DH>Resources: Hot weather is blamed as part of the river dries
up, killing about 24 endangered, tiny fish. Wildlife agency tries to
rescue others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALBUQUERQUE</DL>
<LD>A section of the Rio Grande went dry this week, killing about two
dozen endangered silvery minnows and prompting biologists to try to
rescue about 100 more of the tiny fish.</LD>
<LD>   Federal water managers and wildlife officials said that hot
weather was largely responsible for drying seven miles of the river
through the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge south of
Socorro.</LD>
<LD>   Biologists from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and other
agencies rescued minnows trapped in small, isolated pools of water
along the river Monday and Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   About 100 minnows were collected, but 15 of those died while being
moved, said Joy Nicholopoulos, field supervisor for the service in
New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to determine what impacts [the drying] had ... but
it seems pretty minimal at this point," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As temperatures increased late last week, more water was needed to
keep the river flowing, said Jim Wilber, a biologist at the U.S.
Bureau of Reclamation.</TE>
<TE>   Water managers began releasing extra water from upstream
reservoirs and adjusting irrigation releases, and the flow was
resuming, Wilber added.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Letty Belin of the Land and Water Fund of the Rockies
said it appears the federal government violated an Endangered Species
Act requirement for minimum flows in the river through June.</TE>
<TE>   Starting May 30, the flow in the Rio Grande at San Marcial fell
below 50 cubic feet per second, which is the benchmark in the plan,
according to the U.S. Geological Survey.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be watching to see what the agencies do about this," said
Belin, who represents several environmental groups that sued the
federal agencies over protections for the minnow.</TE>

<HD>Romney Responds to Mass. Residency Issue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Responding to questions about whether he meets requirements to run
for governor, Mitt Romney said Thursday that he filed state tax
returns as a part-time resident in 1999 and 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The state Constitution requires a candidate to live in
Massachusetts for seven consecutive years before running for
governor.</LD>
<LD>   Romney said Thursday he amended those tax filings from "part-time
resident" to "resident" in April, after he declared his candidacy and
opponents questioned whether he was qualified to run.</LD>
<TE>   The former Salt Lake City Olympics chief came under criticism
Wednesday after a report that he paid property taxes on a Utah home
as his "primary residence" from 1999 to 2001 and received a $54,600
tax discount as a result. Romney and the county assessor in Summit
County, Utah, blamed it on a clerical mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Romney said Thursday that where he filed his taxes should have no
bearing on his qualification to run because he and his family have
had a home in the Boston suburb of Belmont for nearly 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   "The key is this: Did you ever decide not to come back to
Massachusetts?" he said. "I never, ever decided not to come back to
Massachusetts."</TE>

<HD>Bloomberg Nears Control Over Schools</HD>
<DH>New York City: Mayor's 'understanding' would give him power
over chancellor and boards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In a major political victory, New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg
reached an agreement with state legislators Thursday that gives him
virtually complete control over the nation's largest public school
system.</LD>
<LD>   Bloomberg, a Republican who had made education reform the priority
of his first six months in office, announced that he and state
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver had reached an "understanding" that
must be approved by the Legislature and New York Gov. George Pataki
before taking effect.</LD>
<LD>   Under the plan, which has been the subject of intense
negotiations, the mayor would have full power to hire and fire the
school chancellor. The city's eight-member board of education would
be replaced with a 13-member advisory panel.</LD>
<TE>   Just as important, the sweeping revision would allow Bloomberg to
appoint the school system's 32 district superintendents and would
abolish New York's 32 community school boards by next June. In return
for these concessions, the mayor would agree to avoid making
crippling budget cuts in public schools unless the city were to face
an economic catastrophe.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an understanding between the mayor and myself, and we've
spoken to both the governor and [state Senate leader] Joseph Bruno
about that understanding," said Silver, a Democrat from Queens who
had the power to approve or scuttle the deal. "We believe we can move
forward to bring about a new era in education in the city of New York
by having a board of education that is controlled by the mayor."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed changes would put Bloomberg in control of a school
system with 1.1 million students, giving him powers that had been
sought unsuccessfully by his predecessors for 25 years. But the deal
also is fraught with peril for the mayor, who has said he wants to
eliminate inefficiencies and run the school system more like a
business.</TE>
<TE>   New Yorkers, who have indicated in polls they want the mayor to
have such powers, have said that school reform is their priority.
Expectations are running high, and Bloomberg faces huge obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   Although the recently approved New York state budget has earmarked
millions in new aid for city schools, the mayor is considering as
much as $1 billion in spending cuts as part of a "doomsday" budget
scenario. New York faces an unprecedented $5-billion deficit, and
Bloomberg has said that all city agencies must be prepared for more
cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the city's teachers have been working without a
contract for 18 months, and they recently took the first steps toward
authorizing a strike vote if they fail to reach a new contract
agreement.</TE>

<HD>Skakel Jury's Request Is Rejected</HD>
<DH>Trial: Judge won't let the panel rehear part of the closing
arguments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NORWALK, Conn.</DL>
<LD>NORWALK, Conn. -- The judge in the murder trial of Kennedy cousin
Michael Skakel rejected a request Thursday from jurors who wanted to
rehear part of the prosecution's closing arguments.</LD>
<LD>   Judge John F. Kavanewsky Jr. said he did not believe the request
could be granted under state law because closing arguments are not
evidence. Skakel's lawyer, Michael Sherman, objected to the request
on those grounds.</LD>
<LD>   The jury ended its third day of deliberations without reaching a
verdict.</LD>
<TE>   Skakel, 41, is accused of beating Martha Moxley to death with a
golf club in October 1975, when they were 15-year-old neighbors in a
wealthy gated community in Greenwich. He is a nephew of Ethel
Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   Susann Gill, a lawyer on the prosecution team, said a repeat of
the closing arguments might help the jury resolve whatever issue it
was considering.</TE>
<TE>   "The state can see no prejudice in having the jury hear again what
they already heard," Gill said.</TE>
<TE>   But Sherman said no authority exists in state law to permit the
rereading.</TE>
<TE>   Kavanewsky said he would tell the jury he couldn't honor that
request. But the judge agreed to reread his instructions on issues
such as reasonable doubt, motive and alibi.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors also reheard testimony of three witnesses, including
forensics expert Henry Lee and a former Skakel friend who said Skakel
had a crush on Moxley. Under cross-examination by Sherman, Lee said
he had no direct evidence to tie Skakel to the killing.</TE>

<HD>Lava Flood May Have Caused Extinction</HD>
<DH>Science: A study suggests molten rock wiped out about 90%
of all species 250 million years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The most extensive extinction in history, the dying-out of about 90%
of all species 250 million years ago, may have been caused by a
massive flow of molten rock that covered an area half the size of
Australia to a depth of more than a mile.</LD>
<LD>   A study appearing today in the journal Science suggests the flood
of molten rock that created a plateau known as the Siberian Traps in
Russia was almost twice as big as previously believed and could have
continued for thousands of years, changing the climate of the entire
planet.</LD>
<LD>   A group of United Kingdom and Russian scientists says in Science
that such an eruption of flood basalt would have filled the planet's
atmosphere with a choking concentration of sulfur dioxide, carbon
dioxide and other gases.</LD>
<TE>   Samples from the lava flow have been age-dated at about 250
million years. Other studies have shown that during this period the
Earth experienced its most extensive extinction crisis--which killed
at least 90% of ocean species and more than 70% of land creatures.</TE>
<TE>   Called the Permian-Triassic extinction, it is a key event in the
planet's history. It was followed by the rise of the dinosaurs, the
animal species that dominated the Earth until they too went extinct
about 65 million years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In the study, the researchers analyzed samples drilled from deep
below the floor of a basin next to the Siberian Traps. They found the
basin was underlain with the same type and age of lava that created
the Traps.</TE>
<TE>   This means the flood of lava that formed the Traps was at least
twice as massive and lasted perhaps twice as long as previously
believed, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Such a large volume of lava spewing to the Earth's surface over
hundreds of thousands of years would inject millions of tons of
chemicals into the atmosphere, causing long-lasting changes in the
climate and an ecological collapse, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence from the new study points toward a prolonged
extinction, stretching over hundreds of thousands of years.</TE>

<HD>Zito's Hot Streak Continues for A's</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With six consecutive victories, Barry Zito says he's only warming up.</LD>
<LD>   Zito overcame a first-pitch home run by Ichiro Suzuki and the
Oakland Athletics went on to defeat the Seattle Mariners, 10-4,
Thursday at Oakland.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't really feel locked in, per se, like I was last season.
I'm still trying to get a feel for the season," he said. "Once you
get 120-130 innings in, that's when things start clicking for me."</LD>
<TE>   Zito, who has a 13-game regular-season winning streak at the
Coliseum, went 11-1 in his last 13 starts last season, ending with a
nine-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Zito (7-2) gave up three runs and eight hits over 6
1/3 innings with one strikeout.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Tejada homered and drove in four runs and Eric Chavez drove
in three as Oakland split the four-game series. The Athletics have
won 10 of their last 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 4, Detroit 3--Rolando Arrojo pitched seven shutout innings
and the Red Sox finished a successful road trip with a victory at
Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   The AL East-leading Red Sox went 8-2 on their swing to Toronto,
New York and Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Nomar Garciaparra had three hits as the Red Sox sent the Tigers to
their third consecutive loss and seventh in eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 4, Chicago 3--Darrell May earned his first major
league victory in nearly five seasons, helping the Royals win at
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   May's last win came on Aug. 31, 1997, when he was pitching for the
Angels. He spent the last four seasons in Japan and began this year
on the disabled list because of a strained left groin.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 5, Tampa Bay 4--Pinch-hitter Eric Hinske hit an RBI single
in the bottom of the ninth inning and the Blue Jays won at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Travis Harper (2-3), who relieved in the seventh after Tampa Bay
starter Joe Kennedy was ejected for throwing behind Ken Huckaby,
walked Chris Woodward and Vernon Wells to start the Toronto ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 8, Cleveland 3--Torii Hunter hit a three-run homer in a
five-run fifth inning to help the Twins defeat Bartolo Colon and the
Indians at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore at New York, ppd.--Because of heavy rain in the
forecast, the Oriole-Yankee game was postponed. No makeup date was
announced.</TE>

<HD>Angels Can't Get Out of This Spot</HD>
<DH>Baseball: A night after rallying to beat Texas, they fall
behind, 7-0, and come up just short in 9-8 loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels spotted the Texas Rangers seven runs Thursday, almost for
the fun of it. The Angels, after all, spooked the Rangers Wednesday
by scoring twice in the ninth inning to tie and three times in the
10th to win.</LD>
<LD>   So, when Texas scored seven runs in the top of the third inning
Thursday and the Angels answered with four in the bottom of the
inning, another night o' thrills was on tap at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels didn't win this time, but they sure made the Rangers
sweat. The Angels scored twice in the eighth inning and twice more in
the ninth, when they got the tying run to third base, but a 9-8 loss
ended the Angels' latest winning streak at four games.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels wasted a chance to close within one game of the Seattle
Mariners in the American League West for the first time since the
first week of the season. Kevin Appier lost his third consecutive
start, though he said afterward arm fatigue might have been partially
responsible and a solution might have been found.</TE>
<TE>   Losses happen. But the Angels' hearts beat a bit faster in the
ninth inning, when slugger Troy Glaus--moved from third base to
shortstop for the final inning after the Angels used two
pinch-hitters--was upended by Calvin Murray as he turned a
double-play pivot.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for the Angels, Glaus was fine. Manager Mike Scioscia
insisted he was not worried about the possibility of losing his
All-Star third baseman to injury while playing him out of position.</TE>
<TE>   "No more so than when he dives headfirst stealing a base or dives
for a ball," said Scioscia, noting that Glaus played shortstop at
UCLA. "That's a play he's made 1,000 times in his life."</TE>
<TE>   Garret Anderson homered twice and drove in four runs for the
Angels. Juan Gonzalez homered and drove in four runs for Texas, which
avoided a four-game sweep. The Angels are 6-2 against Texas, 3-11
against the rest of the AL West.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels will play their next 15 games against National League
opponents, starting tonight against the first-place Cincinnati Reds,
but the schedule provides five more games against the Rangers at the
end of the month.</TE>
<TE>   If Appier's losing streak is still intact then, the Angels will be
worried. But they're not concerned about him right now, and Appier is
a little less concerned himself. After the game, he said that he has
been feeling a little fatigue in his pitching arm.</TE>
<TE>   After the Rangers knocked him out in the third inning Thursday,
Appier said, he mentioned the fatigue to Angel athletic trainer Ned
Bergert and medical director Lewis Yocum. Rather than order any
tests, the two men suggested a modification to Appier's delivery that
he believes can eliminate the fatigue and enhance his performance,
particularly his breaking ball.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels lost Appier's previous starts by scores of 4-2 and 5-2.
Hard to blame those on the starting pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   This one? Not hard at all.</TE>
<TE>   Appier did not survive a third inning that resembled batting
practice--seven runs, seven hits.</TE>
<TE>   With one out, Jason Romano doubled. Mike Lamb singled. Alex
Rodriguez singled--1-0, Texas. Gonzalez homered--4-0, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Rafael Palmeiro walked. Herbert Perry flied out, and Appier was
close to escaping. But Ryan Ludwick doubled. Bill Haselman grounded
to third baseman Glaus, who bobbled it for an error as Palmeiro
scored--5-0, Texas. Michael Young singled--6-0, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Appier left, but Romano greeted Lou Pote with another single for a
7-0 Texas lead.</TE>
<TE>   Texas starter Kenny Rogers got the victory because the rules say a
starter must if he pitches five innings and leaves with a lead that
his team never loses. But he needed an astounding 102 pitches to
endure five innings, giving up four runs and very nearly giving up
the lead.</TE>
<TE>   In the fifth, pitching with an 8-4 cushion, Rogers was so shaky he
walked Jose Nieves--the first walk for Nieves this season, in 74
plate appearances. With two out, following a single by Darin Erstad
and a walk to Anderson, the Angels had the bases loaded and the tying
run at the plate.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon worked the count full, then flied out to center field.
The inning was done, as was Rogers. Over the final five innings, the
Angels left seven men in scoring position.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the first week of the season, when his name appeared on the lineup
card at designated hitter on consecutive days, Tim Salmon wondered
aloud why fellow outfielders Garret Anderson and Darin Erstad did not
have to take their turns at DH. Salmon also said that Manager Mike
Scioscia had told him he would DH about 10 times this season.</LD>
<LD>   It's the first week of June, and Salmon already has been the
designated hitter 11 times. He is hitting .256 when he starts at DH
and .273 when he does not, but the Angels are 8-3 when he does.</LD>
<LD>   "Initially, it was a pride thing," Salmon said, "but my attitude
has changed. Right now, it's working for the team when I do it. When
you're winning, it's about whatever works. There's no reason to be
making waves about anything."</LD>
<TE>   Scioscia said Erstad would take a turn at DH this weekend.
Scioscia also acknowledged that Salmon's early-season defense did not
measure up to that of Anderson and Erstad.</TE>
<TE>   "They're both playing terrific defense, and that's an important
part of our club," Scioscia said. "Tim had some rough spots, but he's
gotten more confident and more comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baseball sources say the Angels appear to be more likely to
acquire a veteran reliever, particularly a left-hander, than a first
baseman before the July 31 trading deadline. Scott Spiezio has two
home runs, the fewest among American League first basemen with at
least 100 at-bats, but he hit 13 last year and 17 two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though you might perceive a shortage of power from our
everyday first baseman, we don't see that at all," Scioscia said.
"There's power there. It just hasn't manifested itself on a
consistent basis this season."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scouting director Donny Rowland heatedly denied that the Angels
selected their top draft pick primarily because they could sign him
cheaply. The Angels, picking 12th, selected Virginia Tech left-hander
Joe Saunders and signed him for $1.825 million; last year's No. 12
pick signed for $2.075 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels passed on left-hander Scott Kazmir, regarded as having
greater potential but, as a high school player, at greater risk. He
is believed to be seeking a bonus more than twice what the Angels
gave Saunders and a major league contract, which would require his
team to keep him in the majors after three years or risk losing him
on waivers. Kazmir, projected as a top-five pick, fell to the Mets at
No. 15.</TE>
<TE>   "It was more a matter of Kazmir pricing himself out of the top 14
than us thinking Joe was a cheap sign," Rowland said.</TE>

<KH>BELMONT STAKES</KH>
<HD>Not Their Favorite</HD>
<DH>Despite his success training horses, Baffert has had
strained relationships with some of their owners</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ELMONT, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Bob Baffert, three-time Eclipse Award winner, the No. 1 trainer on
the money list again this year and conditioner of War Emblem, a
possible Triple Crown champion, doesn't please all of his clients all
the time. In fact, Baffert at one time didn't even please Ahmed bin
Salman, the Saudi Arabian prince who owns War Emblem.</LD>
<LD>   "We weren't doing much good, and the prince took his horses away
from me," Baffert said.</LD>
<LD>   Then a few years later, in early 2000, the prince called Baffert
to renew their partnership.</LD>
<TE>   "He said that [Richard Mulhall, president of Bin Salman's
Thoroughbred Corp.] had gone too far, that all he was trying to do
was protect [the prince's] interests," Baffert said. "Then he asked
me to go out to the farm and pick out five or six horses."</TE>
<TE>   Having just been sacked by Aaron Jones, another well-heeled owner,
Baffert was very much in the market for new horseflesh. He accepted
the prince's offer, and one of the horses he selected at the farm in
Bradbury was Point Given, who won last year's Preakness and Belmont
Stakes and was voted the Eclipse Award for best 3-year-old colt.</TE>
<TE>   In tandem, Baffert and the prince are back at the Belmont, which
will be run Saturday. The difference this time is that their War
Emblem, whom Baffert green-lighted for the prince to buy for $900,000
in April, not only can win the Belmont but can collect a $5-million
bonus for sweeping the Triple Crown. He's the even-money favorite in
a field that was reduced to 11 horses Thursday with the scratch of
30-1 shot Puzzlement, who has a bruised foot.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to bet War Emblem so badly in the Kentucky Derby, but
because of Baffert I just couldn't do it," said Barbara Walter, an
owner who once employed Baffert but said she would never send horses
to him again. "I'm pulling for War Emblem to win the Belmont because
racing needs that, but not because of the trainer."</TE>
<TE>   Barbara and Bob Walter raced Charmonnier, whose victory in the
1991 California Cup Classic at Santa Anita encouraged Baffert to
permanently forsake the quarter horse business and concentrate on
thoroughbreds. The Walters also raced Cavonnier, who lost the closest
of photo finishes to Grindstone in the 1996 Kentucky Derby. That was
Baffert's first year at the Derby; since then he's won the race with
Silver Charm in 1997, Real Quiet in 1998 and War Emblem this year.</TE>
<TE>   The Walters, who live in Sebastopol in Northern California, have
fired Baffert twice, first in 1992 and then again a couple of years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't like the way he treated our horses and we thought he
exercised poor judgment," Barbara Walter said.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert's autobiography, "Dirt Road to the Derby," published in
1999, also incensed the Walters. Generally, they objected to its
smart-alecky tone and bathhouse humor.</TE>
<TE>   "In the beginning, Bob was Peck's bad boy and was so charming,"
Barbara Walter said. "Now he's snide, arrogant and dirty."</TE>
<TE>   Baffert said that he would train again for the Walters if given
the chance.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time I'd have trouble with [Bob Walter], his wife would
smooth things over," Baffert said. "She and I were born on the same
day [Jan. 13]. I had trouble communicating with [Bob Walter]. I
thought I did a good job for them. We still talk when we run into
each other. When I'm wrong, I can take it. But when I'm right, I
stick to my guns."</TE>
<TE>   In the book, Baffert said that when Grindstone and Cavonnier hit
the wire almost simultaneously in the Derby, Barbara Walter put up
two fingers, indicating that she thought Cavonnier had finished
second.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like cutting her fingers off," Baffert said in the book.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Walter said that she wrote the publisher, The Blood-Horse
Inc., complaining about the book.</TE>
<TE>   The Walters said that Baffert used their brilliant filly, Tout
Charmant, as a rabbit--a horse who sets the pace for another
horse--in the 1999 Matriarch at Hollywood Park. Baffert's other
horse, for a different owner, was Tuzla, who finished second. Tout
Charmant, who would win the Matriarch in 2000 for her new trainer,
Ron McAnally, finished eighth</TE>
<TE>   "Tout Charmant ran suicidal fractions," Barbara Walter said. "She
was dead after running that fast early. When Bob came to our table
after the race, he said that her jockey, Jerry Bailey, wasn't aware
how fast they were traveling. A jockey like Jerry Bailey not being
able to judge pace? Mr. W. [Bob Walter] had a fit. He said to
Baffert, 'I don't want you to ever use one of my horses as a rabbit.'
"</TE>
<TE>   When Tout Charmant was later sold to Bob and Janice McNair for
$1.1 million, a stipulation of the sale by the Walters was that the
horse be transferred from Baffert to McAnally.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing you have to admit about Bob Baffert is that he has a
hell of an eye for a horse," Barbara Walter said. "Look how he found
War Emblem just in time for the Derby. No matter how much you might
dislike him otherwise, he's really got that going for him."</TE>
<TE>   Jones, a lumber tycoon from Eugene, Ore., declines to be specific
about his problems with Baffert, whom he dropped as a trainer in
January 2000. What Jones will say is that Baffert was too hard on his
horses.</TE>
<TE>   After the breakup, there reportedly was a heated phone call
between Jones and Baffert about whether Baffert was owed a breeding
to Forestry, a horse Baffert bought for Jones at auction for $1.5
million in 1997. Baffert trained Prime Timber, the fourth-place
finisher in the 1999 Derby, for Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said in a recent interview that instead of assigning the
breeding to Baffert, he gave the proceeds of the breeding season to
Sherry Baffert, the trainer's former wife, for the college fund of
their four children. Baffert confirmed that account.</TE>
<TE>   "Aaron Jones is one owner--the only one--that I'd never go back
to," Baffert said last week at Churchill Downs, where War Emblem was
finishing up his heavy training for the Belmont. "He had a big bat [a
lot of money to spend] at the sales, and got me into a lot of action,
but I'd never work for him again."</TE>
<TE>   A day later, Baffert revised that.</TE>
<TE>   "Better say I'd probably train for him again," he said. "Time has
a way of healing things. Give anything enough time and things can
change."</TE>
<TE>   According to the owner, speculation about a Jones-Baffert truce is
pointless.</TE>
<TE>   "Hell, no, I wouldn't give him any of my horses again," Jones
said.</TE>

<HD>At 41, Kiraly Is Back for More</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Karch Kiraly was back on the beach, pink baseball cap and all,
playing as if time had slipped back a decade or so.</LD>
<LD>   He was reminded of his age by a group of hecklers--"Serve it to
the old man, he's weak, he can't hit"--but Kiraly, 41, simply smiled.
Three Olympic gold medals have a way of instilling a measure of
confidence.</LD>
<LD>   It had been a long two years for Kiraly, who practically
disappeared from the beach volleyball landscape amid a rash of
injuries--shoulder, groin, Achilles' heel--but bobbed up to the
surface two weeks ago at the Huntington Beach Open.</LD>
<TE>   Kiraly didn't win Huntington, but he and partner Brent Doble tied
for third, a championship of sorts for a guy who used to kick sand at
anything less than first.</TE>
<TE>   Beach volleyball's all-time leader with 142 tournament
championships, Kiraly hadn't come close to an Assn. of Volleyball
Professionals title in almost two years.</TE>
<TE>   He will get another chance at the Hermosa Beach Open, which starts
today with qualifying rounds and ends with the main draw Saturday and
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Kiraly and Doble were better than expected at Huntington,
advancing to the semifinals as the eighth-seeded team before getting
ousted by Canyon Ceman and Mike Whitmarsh in a tight match.</TE>
<TE>   "I think things were going quick and pretty well," Kiraly said.
"We had a lot of good wins against some higher-seeded teams. We were
right there almost ready to beat Whit and Canyon, we just needed a
couple more points. I was quite happy with the level I played
throughout the weekend, [being] the oldest guy out there."</TE>
<TE>   Whitmarsh, the second-oldest AVP player, turned 40 last month. He
has seen plenty of Kiraly over the years, losing to Kiraly and Kent
Steffes in the gold-medal match at the 1996 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing wrong with Karch," Whitmarsh said. "He may not be
jumping as high as he used to or hitting as hard, but he's smart. He
has so much experience and he knows tendencies so well. Players like
that are one step ahead of other players. I'd be surprised if he
doesn't win a tournament this year."</TE>
<TE>   Kiraly hadn't been close to winning anything since taking the
Virginia Beach Open with former partner Adam Johnson on July 30,
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Kiraly's troubles began barely a week later, when he dislocated
his right shoulder while trying to qualify for the Sydney Olympics at
a tournament in Belgium. He went through surgery, then shoulder
rehabilitation and was ready for the start of last AVP season ...
until he injured his Achilles' a few days before the first
tournament. He sat out all but the final two tournaments and finished
ninth with Scott Ayakatubby at both Santa Barbara and Manhattan
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Kiraly is now injury-free. He played well at Huntington. The next
AVP tournament has been good to him in the past. He has won Hermosa
six times, including three in a row from 1996-98. Any talk of

<LD>Dan Barreiro of the Minneapolis Star Tribune says there are a million
reasons to root against the Lakers in the NBA Finals:</LD>
<LD>   "Folks are tired of the Lakers hogging all the attention and the
rings. Folks are tired of the obligatory police-car torching outside
Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   "People are tired of Shaq. They've seen enough of Kobe. They've
seen way too much of Jack Nicholson and Dyan Cannon.</LD>
<TE>   "There is, on the other hand, one outstanding reason to cheer for
the Lakers to destroy the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   "It would further annoy Red Auerbach."</TE>
<TE>   More Barreiro: "Red has his nose out of joint. Phil Jackson is on
the brink of tying Red's record for most titles won by an NBA coach
[nine].</TE>
<TE>   "So, when interviewed about the prospect, has Auerbach taken the
high road and congratulated Jackson on approaching such a magnificent
milestone?</TE>
<TE>   "Of course not. Red has done everything he can to denigrate
Jackson's achievements.</TE>
<TE>   "The message to Red should be clear: Shut up."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: It's widely known that Jerry West's silhouette is on
the NBA logo. Whose silhouette is on the Major League Baseball logo?</TE>
<TE>   Night and day: Rick Telander of the Chicago Sun-Times says it
isn't difficult to tell the difference between heavyweight foes
Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson:</TE>
<TE>   "Born in England and raised in Canada, Lewis has a diffident,
no-nonsense demeanor, a quiet out-of-the-ring life (featuring a lot
of chess) and, of course, that lilting British accent.</TE>
<TE>   "Compared to Tyson's snarling Brooklynese, Lewis' diction sounds
like an Oxford professor's. And the tone of his voice makes us feel
that, yep, here's a basically normal guy."</TE>
<TE>   For the record: Tyson, taking offense to something former New York
Post columnist Wallace Matthews once wrote about him, said:</TE>
<TE>   "[He] called me a rapist and a recluse. I'm not a recluse."</TE>
<TE>   Earning his stripes: Tiger Woods says one of his most memorable
rounds came when he was allowed to play Navy Golf Course in Los
Alamitos on his 10th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "They wouldn't let anyone under 10 play," Woods said.</TE>
<TE>   But Woods' father, Earl, said his son actually began playing the
course when he was 3.</TE>
<TE>   "He did so well that they complained, and pulled out some Naval
regulation that said you had to be 10," Earl said.</TE>
<TE>   Crowded field: Even after the U.S. soccer team's upset of
Portugal, the World Cup probably will have trouble attracting an
American audience, says Linda Robertson of the Miami Herald:</TE>
<TE>   "It is competing with the NBA Finals, the Stanley Cup finals,
baseball, golf ... [and it's] just soccer's luck that this World Cup
coincides with a horse's run at the Triple Crown."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Former Minnesota Twin slugger Harmon Killebrew.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Like a lot of people, Chuck Culpepper of the
Oregonian was pulling for longtime underdogs Sacramento and New
Jersey to reach the NBA Finals:</TE>
<TE>   "Think of it, and it's sublime. It'd be sort of like looking out
the kitchen window and seeing a purple horse run across the yard.
Might startle you, might scare you, but eventually you'd come to
appreciate the sheer originality of it."</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAITAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>Cameroon scored its first victory in 12 years of World Cup play
Thursday when it beat Saudi Arabia, 1-0, to keep alive its hopes of
reaching the tournament's second round.</LD>
<LD>   Samuel Eto'o drove home a low shot from inside the area in the
65th minute to lift the struggling African side to victory against a
Saudi Arabia team that improved dramatically from an 8-0 loss to
Germany in its opening match.</LD>
<LD>   It marked the Indomitable Lions' first shutout in 12 World Cup
matches.</LD>
<TE>   "This was an important victory for us," Cameroon Coach Winfried
Schaefer said. "It's our first victory since 1990, which is important
for Cameroon's confidence and morale.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw my team really working and they really believed the goal
would come."</TE>
<TE>   The result leaves Cameroon, which tied Ireland, 1-1, in its opener
Saturday, in second place in Group E with four points, behind leader
Germany on goal difference. Ireland has two points and Saudi Arabia
none.</TE>
<TE>   However, with two teams qualifying from each group and with
Ireland strongly tipped to beat the Saudis in its last game, Cameroon
may have to beat Germany on Tuesday in order to advance to the second
round.</TE>
<TE>   Cameroon, which reached the quarterfinals in 1990, has struggled
since at the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   It failed to advance beyond the first round in 1994 and 1998.</TE>

<HD>Draft Disappoints Reyes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is a tale of two mysteries--one solved, the other unsolved.</LD>
<LD>   The one solved involves the right elbow of USC junior pitcher
Anthony Reyes. A shooting sensation suddenly became an obstacle at
the start of the season. That pain has long since disappeared without
surgery, and he has continued to be the ace of the Trojan staff.</LD>
<LD>   What hasn't been solved is why Reyes fell precipitously in
baseball's first-year player draft Tuesday. Once projected as a
first-round pick, the right-hander expected an early call even with
lingering questions about the elbow. Instead, he watched round after
round go by, finally becoming the 380th player taken, a 13th-round
selection by the Detroit Tigers.</LD>
<TE>   As he prepares for the most important start of the season tonight
against Stanford in a best-of-three super-regional series, Reyes has
a question of his own. What happened?</TE>
<TE>   "It's disappointing," he says quietly. "I'm just going to go out
there and keep proving that I'm healthy. That's all I can do."</TE>
<TE>   It hasn't been an easy season for the former Whittier California
High star. He has pitched well with a 4-1 record and a 3.26
earned-run average but hasn't reached the preseason All-American
expectations. He also carries the burden of extending USC's vaunted
pitching lineage that includes Mark Prior, Barry Zito, Seth Etherton,
Randy Flores and Brian Cooper, all of whom are or have appeared in
the major leagues.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was Tuesday. The disappointment was felt throughout
the coaching staff.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't certain that he'd go in the first round," USC Coach Mike
Gillespie said. "But I didn't think he'd last long. It can only be a
concern on the part of the pro people about his arm in spite of the
fact that he's not in pain and he hasn't pitched in pain."</TE>
<TE>   Reyes hasn't been dominant, but he has had a measurable impact
since rejoining the Trojan rotation in March.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's any secret that once he got into the mix, we
go 25-9 in our next 34 games because of the effect he has on who our
pitchers are the next two days," said assistant coach Dave Lawn, who
works with the pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   It figures that if USC (37-22) is to advance to its third
consecutive College World Series and 18th overall, the sturdy,
6-foot-2 right-hander needs a strong outing in tonight's start
against Stanford ace Jeremy Guthrie.</TE>
<TE>   Guthrie presents a major challenge for the Trojans. One of five
finalists for the Golden Spikes Award given to the nation's top
player, the Cardinal right-hander is 11-1 with a 2.34 earned-run
average and five complete games.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Guthrie was the Cleveland Indians' first-round pick
and the 22nd player taken overall.</TE>
<TE>   Reyes said he has nothing personal at stake other than to help USC
win.</TE>
<TE>   But Gillespie and Lawn figure that if Reyes performs well this
weekend and in the College World Series, he could raise his
bargaining power in negotiations with the Tigers. Reyes, who is only
three courses away from getting his bachelor's degree in sociology,
said he is considering a return to USC.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure it means a lot to him," Lawn said of tonight's start.
"If you think of yourself in a certain way and then you're drafted in
a certain round not according to what you thought and then you're
matched up against a guy who's the Pac-10 pitcher of the year, you've
got to love this game."</TE>
<TE>   Reyes would rather shift the focus to the Trojans, who won the
Pacific 10 Conference and are still considered an underdog against a
Stanford team that is traditionally tough at home.</TE>
<TE>   "This team has battled," he said. "It wasn't like last year where
we just kind of rolled along. Everyone started coming around. We just
took off."</TE>

<HD>Senegalese Tie One On With Danes, 1-1</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Senegal, which defeated defending champion France in the opening game
of the World Cup, almost earned another upset victory Thursday but in
the end had to settle for a 1-1 tie with Denmark in front of 43,500
in Daegu, South Korea.</LD>
<LD>   The result left both teams with a chance to advance to the final
16.</LD>
<LD>   The African team, playing in its first World Cup, once again
showed the ability and resolve to keep pace with top European
competition. In fact, by the time referee Carlos Batres of Guatemala
blew the final whistle, it was the Danes, semifinalists in 1998, who
breathed a sigh of relief.</LD>
<TE>   "I think we were lucky to get a point," Denmark Coach Morten Olsen
acknowledged after watching his players wilt in the heat late in the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "They are physical," Olsen said, "and playing in 30 degrees
[Celsius] is something for Africans but difficult for Europeans.
Senegal was the better team in the second half."</TE>
<TE>   Denmark took the lead when forward Jon Dahl Tomasson scored his
third goal of the tournament, netting a penalty kick in the 16th
minute after being knocked down by Senegal midfielder Salif Diao.</TE>
<TE>   Diao made up for that mistake seven minutes into the second half
when he scored to cap a fine counterattacking move by Senegal. But
Diao also earned a second yellow card later in the match and was
ejected.</TE>
<TE>   That blemish aside, Senegal Coach Bruno Metsu was pleased.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are 1-0 behind against a team like Denmark, it's not
easy to come back," he said.</TE>

<HD>Less Pain Means Some Gain for Brown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Pitcher Kevin Brown, suffering from a herniated disk in his lower
back, remained hospitalized for a fourth day Thursday, but his pain
had subsided and his mobility had improved to where he could begin
tests required to determine proper treatment.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors should have enough information later today to determine
whether Brown will begin a physical therapy program or undergo back
surgery. He already is on the disabled list because of inflammation
in his right elbow.</LD>
<LD>   A rehabilitation program, designed to strengthen the lower back
and reduce the bulging disk with medication, would probably sideline
Brown for up to a month.</LD>
<TE>   If the problem requires surgery, in which the protruding disk
would be either cut out or removed with a laser, Brown probably would
be sidelined for at least six weeks and perhaps the rest of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, 37, is in the fourth year of a seven-year, $106-million
contract and is owed $45 million from 2003 to 2005.</TE>
<TE>   He has been on the disabled list five times in the last two
seasons, twice this season after suffering setbacks related to last
September's surgery to repair a torn tendon in his right elbow.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy made a point of pacing Eric Karros during the
first quarter of the season, sitting him for six of the Dodgers'
first 39 games to ease the workload for a first baseman who suffered
chronic lower-back problems in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But as the Dodgers hit the backstretch of 2002, Tracy is going to
the whip. Karros has started the last 20 games, and he prefers that
pace.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been fine the whole year, and I've already had six games
off," Karros, 34, said. "I'm not averse to getting a day off here or
there, but people have to get over the fact that I'm not going
through what I went through last year."</TE>
<TE>   That's evident by Karros' production. Coming off his worst season,
in which he hit .235 with 15 homers and 63 runs batted in, Karros is
batting .310 with five homers and 31 runs batted in, 10 of those RBIs
in the last four games.</TE>
<TE>   He has shown no signs of wear and tear--his average has not fallen
below .290 since April 5, and his defense has been sound.</TE>
<TE>   "He's at the point where he doesn't need as many days off as we
thought he'd need," Tracy said. "As long as he seems strong and he's
not fighting himself [at the plate] we'll keep it this way.</TE>
<TE>   "I have one goal, and that's to have Eric Karros doing exactly
what he's doing now in August and September. If that means he needs a
day off here or there, that's fine."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It took 36 years, but the Dodgers will finally get a chance to
avenge their 1966 World Series loss to the Baltimore Orioles when
they open interleague play tonight with a three-game series in Camden
Yards.</TE>
<TE>   After playing American League West teams for the first five years
of interleague play, the Dodgers will play 12 games against AL teams
they've never faced in the regular season--Baltimore, Tampa Bay,
Toronto and Boston. They'll also have six games against the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting to see some different parks and play some different clubs
should be invigorating--I think playing the AL West got a little
stale," Tracy said. "Camden Yards is a great baseball venue, and the
fans love their Orioles. Playing there will be a unique experience."</TE>
<TE>   So will Tropicana Field, but not because of the atmosphere, fans
or franchise history. The Devil Rays' dome has funky turf and a
series of catwalks near the roof that often come into play.</TE>
<TE>   "The meeting at home plate usually starts around 6:40 [for a 7
p.m. game]," Tracy said. "They have four catwalks and a different
ground rule for each one."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers had a day off in Baltimore on Thursday, and several
players--but not catcher Paul Lo Duca--planned to tour Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "Some guys said they were going to check out the White House," Lo
Duca said. "I told them I'm going to wait until the end of the year
when we visit the president after winning the World Series."</TE>

<DH>England has painful memories from playing Argentina</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FUKUI, Japan</DL>
<LD>Once again, it is England against Argentina in the World Cup, four
years removed from the nervous breakdown at St. Etienne, where one
English icon was born, where another was nearly ruined, where two
controversial referee decisions threatened to undermine 120 minutes
of contents-under-pressure soccer, where one of the greatest World
Cup games played ended in limp predictability--England going out on
penalties.</LD>
<LD>   Has it already been four years? The English, who still haven't
fully recovered from their first World Cup loss to Argentina in 1986,
will argue that they need more time, because David Beckham's broken
foot might have healed, but what about those millions of broken
hearts?</LD>
<LD>   Once again, England appears to be up against it. Argentina looked
fast and formidable in its World Cup-opening victory over Nigeria
last weekend while England unraveled against Sweden just as quickly
as Beckham, making his first appearance since breaking his foot in
mid-April, ran out of gas somewhere around the 40-minute mark.</LD>
<TE>   England held on for a 1-1 tie, barely, saved twice in the second
half by its aging goalkeeper, David Seaman. Now, a point in the World
Cup is a point in the World Cup, unless you're England and your next
game is against Argentina and your best player might not have the
lungs to last much more than a half and your once-reliable defense is
now faced with questions it might not be able to answer.</TE>
<TE>   On the bright side, England has dealt with worse. Amid caldron
conditions on the night of June 30, 1998 in St. Etienne, France,
England and Argentina had their tense second-round struggle--tied at
2-2--interrupted in the 47th minute when the Argentines' cagey
captain, Diego Simeone, goaded Beckham into a retaliatory red card.</TE>
<TE>   After the teams had exchanged first-half penalty kicks, after
England's Michael Owen had scored the goal that changed his life,
after Argentina equalized just before the break on a slick bit of
free-kick trickery, after fans of both countries had settled in to
see if the second half could somehow maintain the pace of the first,
there came the halting thud.</TE>
<TE>   Simeone, sensing that World Cup rookie Beckham could be had,
hounded the young midfielder throughout the first half and opened the
second by fouling him from behind, knocking him to the ground and
appearing to step on Beckham as he walked away from the collision.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Simeone wanted, Beckham lost it. Sort of. Still on the
ground, Beckham flicked his foot at Simeone, knocking the back of
Simeone's leg. Not a smart maneuver, but not the kind of thing that
gets a key midfielder ejected from a round-of-16 game in the World
Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Danish referee Kim Milton Nielsen, hovering over Beckham,
disagreed. Out came the red card, out went Beckham.</TE>
<TE>   Down to 10 men against Gabriel Batistuta, Claudio Lopez and Co.,
England seemed destined to quickly follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, it was 1986 all over again. The England-Argentina soccer
rivalry, emerging from the emotional fallout of the Falklands War, is
really only a two-part drama--a World Cup quarterfinal in Mexico in
1986, followed by the rematch in France 12 years later. But about
that first act: It featured both the most famous goal in the history
of the World Cup--FIFA recently named it the tournament's greatest
goal--and the most infamous, both engineered by Argentina's
Machiavellian midfielder, Maradona.</TE>
<TE>   The match was scoreless in the 55th minute when Maradona and
English goalkeeper Peter Shilton went up for an aerial ball. Shilton
was taller and appeared to have a bead on the ball, but Maradona
succeeded in revolutionizing the sport, if only for a fleeting
moment: He punched the ball, spiking it like a volleyball, away from
Shilton and into the net.</TE>
<TE>   This is a violation of the soccer rule book, traditionally
speaking. Except Ali Ben Nasser, the Tunisian referee, did not have a
clear view of the play and did nothing to disallow it.</TE>
<TE>   The goal stood, despite England's vehement protestations.
Replays--and English fans have seen thousands of them since, mostly
in their nightmares--show Maradona indeed cheated to score. But after
the match, when asked about the goal, Maradona smirked and cheekily
attributed it to "the hand of God."</TE>
<TE>   There was nothing illegal about Maradona's second goal four
minutes later, a half-field dance-and-shimmy through four English
defenders and past Shilton for what proved to be the game-winner.</TE>
<TE>   In four minutes, 114,580 fans inside Azteca Stadium had seen
Maradona at his absolute worst and his absolute best.</TE>
<TE>   In four minutes, England was headed out the tournament, bound for
a galling 2-1 defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve years later, the English had come to St. Etienne intent on
revenge--and were angling in the right direction, following the
18-year-old Owen's dazzling burst through the Argentine defense and
full-sprint strike. Halftime accounting showed some kind of haul:
three halves of Argentina-England World Cup soccer, three of the most
memorable World Cup goals ever scored.</TE>
<TE>   But two minutes into the second half, England was down to 10 men.
Revenge quickly moved to the backburner. Inside Stade Geoffroy
Guichard, nine English defenders dug in their heels in front of
Seaman's net. Inside pubs across England, millions of English
supporters swallowed hard and covered their faces.</TE>
<TE>   For 73 minutes--the last 43 of regulation plus 30 in
overtime--England refused to yield. It was a remarkable display of
defense, England blunting attack after attack. England might have won
it too, in the 81st minute, but fullback Sol Campbell had his headed
goal disallowed when Nielsen cited English captain Alan Shearer for
pressing his elbow against the head of Argentina goalkeeper Carlos
Roa.</TE>
<TE>   It was still 2-2 when the overtime whistle blew. All of England
knew what that meant--penalty kicks--and winced. In 1990, in their
best showing since their lone World Cup championship in 1966, the
English were eliminated in the semifinals in a penalty-kick shootout
against West Germany.</TE>
<TE>   History would soon repeat, with Paul Ince and David Batty failing
in their attempts and Argentina winning the shootout, 4-3.</TE>
<TE>   That was four years ago. Since then, Owen ratcheted up his
reputation from promising fledgling to 2001 European player of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   Beckham, vilified in England for his red card, has steadily remade
his image through a series of championships with Manchester United
and game-saving free kicks for England. He is now England's captain
and undisputed on-the-field leader, which was the reason for the
national hysteria when Beckham had his foot broken during an April
club match against Deportivo La Coruna.</TE>
<TE>   The player whose two-footed tackle took down Beckham, Aldo
Duscher, is from Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   England meets Argentina again Friday in a Group F match in
Sapporo. The English lack a number of things--momentum, a fully fit
Beckham, a fully confident back line--but incentive isn't one of
them.</TE>

<TE>   No Love Lost</TE>
<TE>   The conflict between England and Argentina on the soccer field has
origins earlier than the Falklands War:</TE>
<TE>   1966--In a World Cup quarterfinal in England featuring a level of
brutality that was new to the sport, referee Rudolf Kreitlein tired
of the complaints of Antonio Rattin and sent off the Argentine
captain. After eight minutes of dissent, Rattin finally left the
field. England won, 1-0, and went on to win its only Cup. England
Coach Alf Ramsey later referred to the Argentine players as
"animals," an act still remembered in South America.</TE>
<TE>   1986--Again in a quarterfinal, Argentina prevailed, 2-1, on two
goals by Diego Maradona. The second is considered one of the finest
individual efforts in World Cup history, but the first is one of the
most infamous. Photographs clearly showed Maradona punching the ball
over goalkeeper Peter Shilton with his fist; later, he described the
goal as part Maradona, part "the hand of God."</TE>

<HD>Board to Meet Again on Fair Meet</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Horse Racing Board unanimously agreed Thursday to
schedule a rare single-issue board meeting to further discuss the
proposed move of the 17-day Los Angeles County Fair meet.</LD>
<LD>   The special meeting was required after the seven board members
failed to reach a majority decision about whether the fair meet
should end its 63-year run at Fairplex Park in Pomona and move to
Santa Anita in Arcadia.</LD>
<LD>   Chairman Alan Landsburg and members Sheryl Granzella and Roger
Licht voted for more discussion, but William Bianco, John Harris and
John Sperry voted to reject the move. Marie Moretti abstained.</LD>
<TE>   CHRB spokesman Mike Marten said the meeting will be conducted
later this month near Fairplex. The date will be determined Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt this was a good ruling for us in that the board is showing
continued interest in this subject and they want a full day to make
this decision after a thorough discussion," said James Henwood,
president/chief executive of the Los Angeles County Fair Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Board members noted they anticipated more input from owners and
trainers with horses stabled at Fairplex. Elio Amato, president of
the Fairplex Owners and Trainers Assn., said he would urge the board
to keep racing at Fairplex and approve funding for year-round
training at the facility.</TE>
<TE>   In the meeting that lasted nearly three hours, Henwood said he has
been pressured by the Southern California horse racing industry since
1996 to upgrade the fair meet--Fairplex Park is equipped with a
tight-turned, 5/8-mile dirt track and it lacks a turf course.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the uncertain financial impact, the agreement to add
races at Santa Anita has been opposed by the Oak Tree Racing Assn.,
Del Mar Thoroughbred Club and Hollywood Park along with the
Thoroughbred Owners of California and California Thoroughbred
Trainers.</TE>
<TE>   Said Sherwood Chillingworth, Oak Tree executive vice president: "I
was very surprised by the vote given that every entity objected to
it."</TE>

<HD>French Cup Still Empty</HD>
<DH>Group A: Defending champions on brink of elimination after
0-0 tie with Uruguay. France is scoreless in two games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defending champion France moved to the brink of World Cup elimination
Thursday night when it could manage no better than a 0-0 tie with
Uruguay in an ill-tempered and foul-ridden game in Pusan, South
Korea.</LD>
<LD>   The result means that Coach Roger Lemerre's team has to win its
final first-round match, against Denmark in Inchon, South Korea, on
Tuesday, or become the first reigning champion since Brazil in 1966
to be knocked out in the opening round.</LD>
<LD>   Denmark, meanwhile, needs only a tie to clinch a place in the
final 16.</LD>
<TE>   Making matters worse for the French is the fact that forward
Thierry Henry was red-carded against Uruguay and will be suspended
for the next game. Also missing will be defender Emmanuel Petit, who
picked up his second yellow card and also must sit out Tuesday's
game.</TE>
<TE>   Still to be decided is whether injured playmaker Zinedine Zidane,
who has yet to play in this tournament, will be able to return in
time to help out.</TE>
<TE>   Lemerre, who wore a haunted look on the sideline as France once
again struggled to rediscover its form in the absence of Zidane,
remained positive, although not upbeat.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have hope," he said. "We need a great match against
Denmark, but it is possible."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't possible against Uruguay, which was intent on playing a
hard, physical, oftentimes ugly game against the world champions as
it too struggled to stay alive in the competition.</TE>
<TE>   Uruguay needs to defeat Senegal in Suwon, South Korea, on Tuesday
or it will be ousted from the tournament. The Africans need a tie to
advance.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's game was the 20th of the World Cup but the first to end
scoreless. It was not for want of chances, however, and only some
agile goalkeeping by France's Fabien Barthez and Uruguay's Fabian
Carini kept the scoresheet blank.</TE>
<TE>   In a game that referee Felipe Ramos Rizo of Mexico failed to
adequately control, fouls were frequent and often brutal. Studs-up
challenges were the norm and left players from both sides writhing on
the ground in pain.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd of 38,289 was not amused by the tactics and booed both
teams for their cynical approach.</TE>
<TE>   Henry was ejected in the 26th minute for a rough, two-footed
tackle on Marcelo Romero and France had to play the remainder of the
match one man short.</TE>

<HD>No Delaying Agassi's Departure This Time</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Ferrero, upset at postponement, finishes four-set
quarterfinal victory over American.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>If, indeed, the Spaniard had been iced overnight--as it appeared for
the better part of two sets Thursday--evidence mounted that Juan
Carlos Ferrero was thawing by the fifth game of the fourth set.</LD>
<LD>   There was a loud scream from Andre Agassi when he knocked a
forehand long in that game. Two points later, Agassi missed a
backhand volley, and then, theatrically, mimicked a timid volley and
stuck out his tongue.</LD>
<LD>   For the fourth-seeded Agassi, it went from a whisper of a match
Wednesday to a scream Thursday afternoon, and he fell out of the
French Open in four sets against No. 11 Ferrero. Ferrero beat Agassi,
6-3, 5-7, 7-5, 6-3, in 2 hours 46 minutes. Amazingly, the weather
held and the remaining men's quarterfinals were completed.</LD>
<TE>   Alex Corretja of Spain, a two-time French Open finalist, finished
off a twice-delayed, 7-6 (5), 7-5, 7-5 victory over Romanian Andrei
Pavel and will play his close friend Albert Costa of Spain today in
the semifinals. The other semifinal will feature Ferrero against No.
2 Marat Safin of Russia. Safin had little trouble against 10th-seeded
Sebastien Grosjean of France, who was hobbled by a leg injury. Safin
won, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2, in 1 hour 44 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Pavel returned from Germany in the morning, having become a father
the previous evening. Physically and mentally exhausted from the
back-and-forth drive and joy of seeing his son, Marius, he played
three more games against Corretja. Their match had been stopped late
in the third set because of darkness Tuesday night and rain wiped out
most of the play on the main court Wednesday, enabling Pavel to go to
Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really tired," said Pavel, who had to persuade Roland Garros
security guards to let him on the grounds early in the morning. "I
had maybe an hour of sleep in the car and two hours sleeping on the
couch in the lounge. I've been drinking Coke and eating PowerBars all
night long. I have a cafe au lait."</TE>
<TE>   The day was remarkably free of controversy, unlike Wednesday, when
Ferrero felt that Agassi was allowed to call the shots in having the
match stopped with Ferrero leading, 6-3, 1-0. The day featured rain
delays of nearly 6 1/2 hours and, as it turned out, Agassi did not
want to resume play in the drizzle in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrero said in a television interview Thursday: "But [officials]
decided with Andre it was raining enough. They just decided to stop.
It was kind of strange, but not important."</TE>
<TE>   At first, the overnight break appeared to benefit Agassi, who was
able to work his way into the match.</TE>
<TE>   He broke Ferrero twice in the second set after the resumption, the
second time at love in the 11th game, and held his serve at 15,
taking the set, 7-5, when Ferrero hit a return long.</TE>
<TE>   The momentum shifted a couple of times in the third. Ferrero took
a 4-1 lead, but Agassi fought back to win four of the next five
games. At 5-5, Ferrero fought off three break points and then broke
Agassi in the next game, capturing the set, 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   "He stepped up his game more than me being deflated," Agassi said
of Ferrero's play after surviving the three break points. "I felt
like he kind of got out of jail there and let a few shots start to
fly. He plays a lot of matches, it seems, 6-7, 6-2, 6-7. All of a
sudden, he lets his game fly. He hits a big ball."</TE>
<TE>   Agassi, though disappointed, was not devastated or angered as he
was last year after losing to Grosjean in the quarters or to Karol
Kucera in the second round in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm certainly aware of the opportunities being fewer and fewer,"
he said. "I suppose for me this one has always been the most
difficult one to win, and I felt I was here giving myself a
chance.... But I still like my game in most scenarios out there and
like my chances if I keep working hard."</TE>

<HD>There's Sisterhood at the Top</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Venus, Serena Williams reach final at French Open
and will be 1-2 when rankings are released Monday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Inevitability was one thing.</LD>
<LD>   What made Thursday's tennis history lesson so compelling--for the
first time, sisters Venus and Serena Williams will be ranked No. 1
and No. 2--had more to do with location.</LD>
<LD>   In the beginning, location made it special. As has been often
recorded, they learned to play in Compton, and their quirky father
Richard predicted years ago that his daughters would become No. 1 and
No. 2. Everyone else could play for No. 3.</LD>
<TE>   In the end, location made it even better. Venus, 21, and Serena,
20, completed the ascent in Paris, on what was once arguably their
most troublesome court surface, red clay. The uncertain footing and
the slow surface, which blunted their power, once created nightmarish
results for them at the French Open.</TE>
<TE>   For Venus, there were losses to Barbara Schwartz and Barbara
Schett. For Serena, there were close calls, three-set defeats against
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario and Mary Joe Fernandez.</TE>
<TE>   Clay was tamed, finally and emphatically, in the semifinals
Thursday. First, third-seeded Serena defeated top-seeded defending
champion Jennifer Capriati, 3-6, 7-6 (2), 6-2, in 2 hours 16 minutes
for her first win against Capriati in a Grand Slam event, despite
committing 76 unforced errors. It was a hard-hitting, emotion-filled
contest, featuring tense baseline exchanges.</TE>
<TE>   The second act came from No. 2 Venus Williams, who beat newcomer
Clarisa Fernandez of Argentina, 6-1, 6-4, taking the first set in 19
minutes. Her only difficulty came in closing out the match against
the 20-year-old Fernandez, who at No. 87 was the second-lowest ranked
player to reach the semifinals at Roland Garros.</TE>
<TE>   It will be Williams versus Williams on Saturday in the French Open
final, a repeat of the U.S. Open in September. Venus won that match
in straight sets, and she leads the series, 5-2, but Serena won the
most recent meeting, 6-2, 6-2, in the semifinals at Key Biscayne,
Fla., this year.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're young, you always dream of winning Slams and being
No. 1. I never really dreamed of being No. 2," Serena said, smiling.
"This is the highest I've ever been, so obviously I'm very happy
right now."</TE>
<TE>   Said Venus: "We were just wanting to do so well for the French
Open because we hadn't always done our best here, done as well as we
thought we could do. But this makes it all the much more sweeter to
be No. 1 and No. 2 and also to be in the final."</TE>
<TE>   Venus and Capriati have spent 2002 trading places at No. 1, with
Williams first reaching the top spot in February, becoming the first
African American player to reach No. 1 since the tour established
computer rankings. Capriati will drop to No. 3 when the WTA rankings
are released Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to give them credit," Capriati said. "Inevitable?
There's a lot of things that have happened that made them in this
position, 1 and 2. They were pretty good with planning things. I
don't know if it was like that. They're just having a good year this
year, and we'll see if they stay on top."</TE>
<TE>   Capriati said she wasn't sure whether the Williams sisters would
have done this if Martina Hingis and Lindsay Davenport had remained
healthy. That logic appeared questionable in light of the Williamses'
dominance on the tour since the summer and their increased playing
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   It also could have been the frustration of someone who has lost
five consecutive times to Serena Williams. Capriati looked well on
her way to reversing the trend, taking the first set in 37 minutes.
One rally, the last point of the fourth game, had both players
practically gasping. Williams was down on one knee, and Capriati
rested, leaning on the net.</TE>
<TE>   The long rallies seemed to take more out of Williams early on. Yet
she was able to regroup--taking a 5-2 second-set lead--and regained
her composure after Capriati fought back to go ahead, 6-5. Williams
held her serve at love to make it 6-6, and her powerful serve helped
make the difference in the tiebreaker, as she hit an ace and a
service winner to go from 3-2 to 5-2. Two points later, Capriati
double faulted to lose the set.</TE>
<TE>   In the third, the fifth game was the key. Williams saved two break
points and then broke Capriati in the next game, opening a 4-2 lead,
and didn't lose another game. Williams hit a cross-court backhand
winner on her first match point, then threw her racket in the air and
thrust her arms to the sky. Later, she joined the crowd in saluting
Capriati's exit from the court, clapping for the former champion.</TE>
<TE>   The last word came not from Richard Williams, who made the
prediction long ago, but from Oracene Williams, the mother and coach
of Venus and Serena. (Richard has not been in Paris for the French
Open). Oracene always has shown an admirable sense of fairness--for
instance, clapping for Fernandez. She thought it might be time for
her younger daughter to win a Grand Slam event.</TE>
<TE>   "This time maybe I would like Serena to get one because she hasn't
got one since '99 [at the U.S. Open] and that's what she wants so
badly," Oracene said.</TE>

<LD>Galaxy rookie forward Carlos Ruiz, Major League Soccer's leading goal
scorer, was hit with a $500 fine and a one-game suspension Thursday
by the league's disciplinary committee for his actions late in the
Galaxy's 3-2 loss Saturday at Colorado.</LD>
<LD>   Ruiz, who has 10 goals in 10 games, will serve his suspension
Saturday when the Galaxy plays Chicago at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   During stoppage time last weekend, Ruiz struck Rapid midfielder
Wes Hart in the midsection. The Guatemalan striker was not called for
a foul at the time but replays showed the incident, prompting the
penalties.</LD>
<TE>   A $500 fine also was levied against Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid for
approaching referee Peter Kolkowski and his crew after the Galaxy's
third consecutive loss.</TE>

<DL>ELMONT, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>In a ceremony outside trainer D. Wayne Lukas' barn at Belmont Park on
Wednesday, the proud citizens who own Kentucky Derby runner-up Proud
Citizen unveiled a horse blanket emblazoned with the letters FDNY in
red and NYPD in blue. Two firefighters present obviously appreciated
the gesture, even if Proud Citizen didn't particularly relish sharing
attention with them. Before the ceremony ended, he had taken a bite
out of each blanket.</LD>
<LD>   More than a gesture was the announcement last week by Proud
Citizen's owners that they will donate at least $100,000, along with
any earnings from Saturday's Belmont Stakes beyond that, to the Twin
Towers Fund.</LD>
<LD>   Cynics, of course, are already questioning the motives for such a
public display of charity, wondering if perhaps the owners are
attempting to establish Proud Citizen as the hometown horse as
opposed to War Emblem.</LD>
<TE>   Under pre-9/11 circumstances, War Emblem undoubtedly would be the
crowd favorite of the 90,000 or so spectators expected Saturday at
Belmont Park. Having won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes,
he is attempting to become only the 12th horse to win the Triple
Crown and the first since 1978. People like to feel as if they are
part of history.</TE>
<TE>   But do people in this country want to share that feeling with an
Arab? It is a sad commentary on the time in which we are living that
such a question could be posed in connection with an event as benign
as a horse race. But the issue has been raised because War Emblem is
owned by a Saudi Arabian prince, Ahmed bin Salman, who, despite his
pro-American pronouncements, is not welcome by all at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   After War Emblem won the Kentucky Derby last month, Jimmy Breslin,
the famous columnist for Newsday on Long Island, wrote, "It is
understood that these Saudis won't have the class of a goat. If this
Bin Salman had any, he would stay away and not run his horse out of
respect.... A planned assembly of firefighters at Belmont Park might
send the prince away, and with the horse he rode in on."</TE>
<TE>   Proud Citizen's owners certainly did not endorse such inflammatory
commentary Wednesday. But, whether intended or not, there clearly was
an "us vs. them" tone to some of their remarks.</TE>
<TE>   Claiming that the Belmont will not be a typical horse race, David
Cornstein, who owns Proud Citizen with wealthy developers Bob Baker
and Bill Mack, said, "We're three regular guys from New York versus a
prince from Saudi Arabia."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Of course, this will not be a typical horse race.</TE>
<TE>   But the reasons this race is transcendent has nothing to do with
the owners or their nationalities and everything to do with the
horses they rode in on and their trainers.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Baffert, who trains War Emblem, and Lukas, who trains Proud
Citizen, are two of the most successful and compelling figures in
this or any other sport. Lukas shares the record for trainers with 13
victories in Triple Crown races, but Baffert is coming up fast on the
inside with eight. This is his third opportunity to sweep the Triple
Crown, having barely missed with losses by Silver Charm and Real
Quiet in the Belmont.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert and Lukas are better friends now than in the past,
probably because they wouldn't have any other trainers to talk to if
they didn't talk to each other. Both are resented for all the media
attention they receive.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Murray Johnson, who will saddle Perfect Drift on Saturday,
said he attended a birthday party recently in which Baffert's picture
was attached to the pinata. Johnson wouldn't say whose birthday it
was, but, among those who make their living in horse racing, it could
have been almost anybody's.</TE>
<TE>   Lukas, though, is too secure to belong to the Anybody But Baffert
club. That doesn't mean it will be fine with him if Baffert wins
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "People have asked me all week, 'Wouldn't it be great to see a
Triple Crown winner?' " Lukas said Wednesday. "My answer is, 'No, not
at my expense.' "</TE>
<TE>   Just as his chance to sweep the Triple Crown in 1999 with
Charismatic was spoiled in the Belmont, Lukas could play the spoiler
this time. Proud Citizen was second in the Derby and third in the
Preakness. He is the second favorite here at 5-1. War Emblem is even
money to win.</TE>
<TE>   "When we go over there at 5:30 [EDT] on Saturday, he'll look down
and know he has us to contend with," Lukas said of War Emblem. "And
we'll know we have to be concerned with him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   But for anyone to characterize this race as American vs. Arab is
un-American.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, the debate over racial profiling has become a
tug-of-war for the soul of the country. It is an important, even
necessary, debate, but not one that belongs on the playing fields or
racetracks of America.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Salman has not been drawn publicly into the discussion. A
nephew of Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, he has raced horses in the United
States for several years and has a residence in Bradbury, close to
Santa Anita. Loyalty oaths, we can only hope, will not be part of
homeland security, but there is no evidence to dispute his statement
that he is pro-American.</TE>
<TE>   Some have suggested that he could buy favor by matching the
donation of Proud Citizen's owners to the Twin Towers Fund. That is
his business. It should be pointed out, however, that their generous
contribution is hardly unprecedented for horse owners.</TE>
<TE>   A prominent family donating earnings from last year's Breeders'
Cup at Belmont, which was held six weeks after the terrorist attacks,
to 9/11 charities was the Maktoums of Dubai in the United Arab
Emirates.</TE>

<LD>Before they try to win Saturday's Belmont Stakes with Sunday Break,
jockey Gary Stevens and trainer Neil Drysdale will go for another
Grade I victory today at Belmont Park.</LD>
<LD>   Bella Bellucci, who has the reputation of being the country's top
3-year-old filly even though she has yet to face any of the top
members of her class in 2002, will face You and four others in the
$250,000 Acorn. Bella Bellucci will break from post five for the
one-mile Acorn.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Michael Tabor, the gray daughter of French Deputy has won
four of five. She missed the Kentucky Oaks due to a minor setback and
will be running in her first Grade I since she was third in the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Oct. 27.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Ed Gann and trained by Bobby Frankel, who will team in
the Belmont with the disappointing Medaglia d'Oro, You is far more
accomplished than the likely favorite. She has won five of nine and
has won three Grade I races--the Frizette at Belmont Park and the Las
Virgenes and Santa Anita Oaks at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   The other four entrants are Dust Me Off, Willa On The Move, Proper
Gamble and Nonsuch Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Stakes-winning mares Go Go and Kalookan Queen
will renew their rivalry in the $100,000 Desert Stormer Handicap at
Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Jerry Bailey. Almost annually the country's leading
rider, Bailey began the Belmont Park meet with 20 wins from his first
57 mounts.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: The field in tonight's fifth at Hollywood Park. The
nine original entrants in the $8,000 claimer are a combined three for
46 in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using GL's Gold Strike, Cat Blade
and Confess in the fifth; Pride Of Cats, Solar Way, Villa Amalfi and
Seeingisbelieving in the sixth; singling Go Go in the seventh and
using Call Me Again and Orange 'Em in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/84. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $3.20/$472.20. Total money bet: $566.</TE>

<LD>The news from Sacramento that consumer advocate Ralph Nader has taken
up for the local basketball club was met by smirks in Los Angeles,
especially because Nader can't shoot free throws, either.</LD>
<LD>   Sports fans in the state capital are particularly displeased with
the officiating in Game 6, and Nader has been quoted as suggesting
that the nation is on the verge of collapse as a result.</LD>
<LD>   Phil Jackson, of course, couldn't resist.</LD>
<TE>   "Sacramento is a political town, is it not?" he said. "They would
have some consumer advocate groups and Ralph Nader would be there. I
think that's typical. I think the norm, when you go through a course
of a year and you look at how many free throws a game Shaquille
[O'Neal] makes or takes, I think you'd find that somewhere in the
balance of a seven-game series against Sacramento that he shot about
the normal amount he would normally shoot.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's ridiculous that this was done. But, you know, I do
feel sorry for Sacramento. It's tough to be good losers. It is. It's
not an easy thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey forward Kenyon Martin  took exception Thursday to an
assertion by Jackson that the Lakers gave the Nets confidence with
three lackluster quarters in Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   "We had confidence before the game," he said. "They didn't give us
confidence. How they going to take something they didn't give us?
They didn't give us anything, so they can't take nothing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laker defenders played well off Martin in Game 1, often allowing
him to shoot at will from outside 16 feet or so.</TE>
<TE>   "You get Kenyon Martin a clear lane to the basket, you know what
he's going to do with it," Kobe Bryant said. "You're better off
backing up off of him.... If he takes a jump shot, put a hand in his
face and contest it."</TE>
<TE>   Martin shot seven for 22.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bryant drives a car--a black Ferrari--he calls "the Horse," and
the Belmont Stakes is being run Saturday, so it seemed a good time
for a question about thoroughbreds. Or something like that.</TE>
<TE>   "Do I think horses are athletes?" Bryant repeated to a man across
the room. "I would say so, yeah. Because they run around the track. I
don't know about the guys that are on their backs ... but the horses
are fine."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were reasonably satisfied with their defense on Jason
Kidd in Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   He scored 23 points, but needed 26 shots to get them. On the other
hand, Kidd had five rebounds and four assists in the fourth quarter
to get his triple-double.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to get his," Lindsey Hunter said. "He's going to score
and get his assists. As good as he is, it's hard to stop him, and I
don't think he really got into his game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Byron Scott told ESPN this week that Bryant's wife, Vanessa, was
pregnant. After Game 1, Scott said he'd been wrong, and publicly
apologized to the Bryants.... The Lakers hope to play an exhibition
series in Japan before the 2003-04 season, when they probably will
return to Hawaii for training camp.</TE>

<KH>NBA FINALS NEW JERSEY AT LAKERS</KH>
<HD>Shaq Dab in the Middle</HD>
<DH>Domination of Finals is nothing new to O'Neal, who seems to
save his best for last</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>That's 76 points and 65.1% shooting and 28 rebounds in two games
against the New Jersey Nets this season for the man from Newark, a
few tollbooths southwest of the Meadowlands.</LD>
<LD>   That's 134 points and 64.4% shooting and 51 rebounds in four games
over two seasons for Shaquille O'Neal against the Nets, who defend
him as if they were a man with his hand out, collecting quarters on
the turnpike as O'Neal whizzes past, bass thumping.</LD>
<LD>   So, while the Lakers try to get a handle on Jason Kidd and what he
does in tonight's Game 2 of the NBA Finals at Staples Center, the
Nets have the larger task in O'Neal, and what he does.</LD>
<TE>   Frankly, O'Neal couldn't care. Go straight up, double-team him,
zone him, bolo tie him with the Collins twins, dress out Willis Reed,
whatever.</TE>
<TE>   Not interested.</TE>
<TE>   "Been getting doubled all my life," he said Thursday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   He is twice the Finals MVP, even as news conferences and skull
sessions raged with debates on how to stop him, from L.A. to
Indianapolis to Philadelphia, and now New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   It is neither a new issue nor a new story: O'Neal grinds through
the regular season, gathers momentum in the early rounds, then thumps
some poor fellow from the Eastern Conference, be it Rik Smits,
Dikembe Mutombo or Todd MacCulloch.</TE>
<TE>   Since being outplayed by Houston's Hakeem Olajuwon in the 1995
Finals, an experience he occasionally trots out to prove his
humility, O'Neal has averaged 35.8 points and 16.3 rebounds in 12
Finals games.</TE>
<TE>   The popular theory is that by the time the Finals come around,
O'Neal is mulling his ultimate place in the game, and what another
banner or two would do for that. Even teammates, who would seem to
know him as well as anyone, concur, though O'Neal denies it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that I want it to be a part of my legacy," O'Neal said.
"When I was in Orlando, we got swept. I made a promise to myself and
my family that if we ever got back to the Finals I will make sure
that [doesn't] happen again. So every game on, I just have to make
myself known, make my presence known."</TE>
<TE>   He does leave an impression. Typically, it's in the face or neck
region.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of another enormous game by O'Neal--36 points and 16
rebounds in Game 1--a question being lobbed around the news
conferences Thursday afternoon was the basketball version of "Ginger
or Mary Ann?" That is, "Shaq or Michael?"</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, an otherwise intelligent man, last year was sucked into
the Shaq-or-Kobe query, chose Shaq, and suffered the consequences. A
year later, he grinned.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, sure," he said. "You want to stab me in the back now or
later?"</TE>
<TE>   He won six championships with Michael Jordan, and has two--in two
seasons--with O'Neal. Kobe Bryant, however, did not hesitate.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq," he said. "Because Shaq shoots such a high percentage. I
think everybody knows that. I mean, you give him the ball in the
paint, that's an automatic two. He's a modern Wilt Chamberlain. What
he does, you don't see anybody else doing in the history of the
game."</TE>
<TE>   So, he'd bypass Jordan, then?</TE>
<TE>   "I would have to, man," Bryant said. "I would have to take Shaq."</TE>
<TE>   Byron Scott?</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq," he said. "He's the most dominant player in the game. I
mean, finding guys like Shaq, they come around once in a lifetime.
I'm not saying you're going to find two or three Michael Jordans, but
you just don't find a Shaq."</TE>
<TE>   Not unless you look into the lane, beneath the bodies, come June.</TE>
<TE>   What looks OK to O'Neal in December, looks good to him in
February, and better to him in April. By June, the ring and the
championship are close enough, and he becomes a combination of all of
those old centers he idolized, from Ewing to Robinson, and
Chamberlain and Russell from further back.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, this has been the most trying season of his past three,
given the arthritic toe that probably will require postseason
surgery. There have been other injuries, but the big right toe has
been the constant ache in his life, from October in Hawaii to this
morning in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "I still feel pretty much the same, but I've been getting through
it all year," O'Neal said. "I don't think anybody can do what I do.
I've been playing through pain. I never really talk about the pain
unless you guys ask me. But I've just always been sucking it up."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if it were easier to play through now, with the end of the
season so clear, he shook his head and said, "No, it's not whether
it's easy, hard. When I go into the game, the adrenaline takes over.
Feel no pain."</TE>
<TE>   Particularly now, though, in Game 2 of the NBA Finals, versus
three months ago, when the only things ahead were trips and ice
buckets and little anti-inflammatory tablets and games whose meanings
were debatable.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, yeah, of course, of course," he said. "Definitely more now."</TE>

<LD>Royalclassic Express, perfect in two starts for owners Jerry and
Shannon Fizer and trainer John Cooper, will try to remain unbeaten
this evening.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the 2-year-old A Classic Dash filly will try to
qualify for the $350,000 Governor's Cup Futurity, part of California
Breeders Champions Night on June 22.</LD>
<LD>   Royalclassic Express, an Idaho-bred purchased for $6,500, will
break from the outside in the second of seven 350-yard trials for the
Governor's Cup. Fifty-six 2-year-olds are scheduled to compete with
the 10 fastest times moving to the Governor's Cup.</LD>
<TE>   In the sixth trial, which goes as the eighth on the 10-race card,
Doreme Fasolasi Win is the 6-5 morning-line choice. The Apollo colt,
fourth behind Morning Snow, Lonely Moon Sign and Suzy Cartel in the
Kindergarten Futurity on May 18, figures to relish the additional 50
yards he will have to work with tonight.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. A Red Hot Star. 2. Make A Rare Run. 3. Female
Friend. 4. Royalclassic Express. 5. Azyoucansee. 6. Special Queen SA.
7. Deefirst. 8. Doreme Fasolasi Win. 9. Flys R Streakin. 10. Mr
Vargas.</TE>
<TE>   Four! In the seventh, use Dashnlitia, Deefirst and First Rate
Choice, single Doreme Fasolasi Win in the eighth, use Flys R Streakin
and Ipomea in the ninth and Vallarta Royal, Mr Sunset Saint and Mr
Vargas in the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Nike Dash could improve for trainer Paul Jones
in the third. Cat Speed was game winning at 41-1 in her bow for
trainer Harry Nelson and could be a factor in the fourth.</TE>

<HD>Hernandez Says the Sub Way Is OK</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIKUNI, Japan</DL>
<LD>This wasn't the road Luis Hernandez imagined after scoring four goals
in the 1998 World Cup, leading Mexico to a berth in the second round
and a near-upset of Germany in the round of 16.</LD>
<LD>   Since France '98, Hernandez became Mexico's all-time leader in
goals scored for the national team, but also was a huge
disappointment with the Galaxy, where he never fulfilled the team's
wishful hopes that his presence would double home attendance and
deliver an MLS championship or two.</LD>
<LD>   Back in Mexico, Hernandez also lost his spot on the national team,
an apparent victim of Coach Javier Aguirre's purge of over-30
veterans last summer. With so much talk of Aguirre wanting players
willing to work hard and sacrifice personal objectives for the good
of the team, the implication was that Hernandez had become too old
and self-satisfied to earn a place in Aguirre's program.</LD>
<TE>   His recall to Mexico's World Cup team in April was considered a
surprise, even if the inclusion of a 33-year-old World Cup veteran
with a knack for finding the back of the net made practical sense.
Hernandez was Aguirre's first reserve off the bench in Mexico's World
Cup opener Monday, playing 23 minutes in the 1-0 victory over
Croatia.</TE>
<TE>   At the team's training site in Mikuni, reporters asked Hernandez
how he was handling his transition from World Cup star to substitute.</TE>
<TE>   "In the first one, I didn't set out to become a star. It just
happened and I'm glad it happened," Hernandez said. "I thank God that
that happened.</TE>
<TE>   "This time, I'm not worrying about things like that. I'm just
going to enjoy being here with the team. Just being here gives me
joy."</TE>
<TE>   Except when it's meet-the-press time after practice and Hernandez
keeps getting asked about what it's like to experience the World Cup
from "the outside" this time.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, it's different, but it's great," he replied. Then,
bristling, he added, "I'm in the World Cup. It's something you are
never going to experience."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez entered the Croatia game as a replacement for Cuauhtemoc
Blanco, his former club teammate at Necaxa. Hernandez said he hopes
to get some playing time alongside Blanco because "he knows me and
we've played together for a long time, with the national team and
with Necaxa.... In between good players and important players, it's
always easy to get along with them and understand them."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez acknowledged that his new role has been an adjustment.
As one of the team's reserves, he said, "We practice to play and to
be ready in case [Aguirre] calls us. And, God willing, he takes that
into account and puts us into the game.</TE>
<TE>   "And if not, it's important to just be ready for the appointed
time he wants us to play."</TE>
<TE>   Still, his chemistry with Blanco during training scrimmages has
Hernandez pining to try it while wearing the green of the national
team, not just yellow practice bibs.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, it's good," Hernandez said. "But I hope we don't just use it
in practice. I hope we can put it to use in a match."</TE>

<KH>MOTOR RACING MARTIN HENDERSON</KH>
<HD>Sponsors Now Racing to Ride With Barron</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He may wonder what might have been if yellow flags had not come out
at the end of the 86th Indianapolis 500, but Alex Barron is
reasonably content with the reality of his fourth-place finish in
"the greatest spectacle in racing."</LD>
<LD>   Since Barron was named co-rookie of the year with South African
Tomas Scheckter, who led the most laps, things have become
increasingly rosy for Barron. Or, perhaps, increasingly green.</LD>
<LD>   "We're [attracting] more sponsors for the [Blair Racing] team,"
Barron said. "I've been involved in a lot of PR stuff that's going
on--things that didn't come along until we went through the month of
May. We have a lot of momentum with the driver and the team, and when
that happens, you get a lot of exposure and a lot of things come to
you.</LD>
<TE>   "With a rookie team to come into the IRL and move from ninth to
fifth [in the standings] with five races gone and 10 to go, people
are seeing we're going to be a player throughout the season."</TE>
<TE>   Helio Castroneves won his second consecutive Indy 500--Paul
Tracy's Team Green has filed an appeal on that score--but Barron
might have shocked the racing world with a victory for team owner
Larry Blair had it not been for two late-race caution flags, on Lap
173, then again on Lap 198. Barron, who earlier had led twice, for a
lap each, pitted under green flag conditions on Lap 165.</TE>
<TE>   "We were the only ones who could finish the race on fuel prior to
that," said Barron, who started 26th in the 33-car field in
Dallara-Chevrolet. We would have won because everybody else had to
pit [for fuel]."</TE>
<TE>   Blair, who had run cars off and on in CART, decided in December to
field a car in the less expensive Indy Racing League and assembled
his team in January. That was a concern to Barron, 32, who knew this
was his best opportunity to stay in the big leagues of open wheel
auto racing.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little worried that the team got put together a little
late," he said. "[Blair] put together some key people in a short
amount of time, and we're competing [against] a lot of guys who have
been doing it quite a few years in the series."</TE>
<TE>   Barron, who lives in Menifee, in Riverside County, competed in the
World Shifter Kart Series in Europe in 1994 and '95, as well as in
America, winning 64 of 68 kart races. Moving to Formula Atlantic, a
CART development series, he won the title in 1997. He drove for CART
team owner Dan Gurney in 1998, and had stints with Roger Penske and
Dale Coyne before hooking up with Blair for the last two races of
last season in CART.</TE>
<TE>   In the two races since Ray-O-Vac came aboard as a sponsor, Barron
has finished sixth and fourth. Now, he says, the pressure is on to
follow it up with a terrific performance Saturday at the Boomtown 500
at Texas Motor Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   "More than anything, we need to stay consistent," Barron said.
"Realistically, we have a shot at trying to win the championship. The
most important thing is to finish the race. The more we race, the
more comfortable I feel. The chemistry has come a long way in the
last couple of months."</TE>
<TE>   With the Ray-O-Vac backing--and maybe the new money that could
come from his Indy performance--Barron is thinking about digging into
the lead of those drivers ahead of him in the standings, Penske
drivers Castroneves (195 points) and Gil de Ferran (169), last year's
champion Sam Hornish Jr., (159) and Felipe Giaffone (140). Barron has
109 points.</TE>
<TE>   "We're able to do more development, more testing," Barron said.
"We're able to buy more of the equipment that we need. [Sponsorship]
just helps the whole program. Before we got it, we were definitely
going to make sure we didn't overextend ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Realistically, to win the championship will be very tough, but
that's what you're always looking forward to trying to do, and that's
what we're going to go for."</TE>

<TE>   Gary Scelzi may have won three top-fuel championships in a
five-year span for Alan Johnson, but his seven-week tenure in the
first-year Toyota Celica funny car for Johnson's team was hardly the
success he hoped for.</TE>
<TE>   After failing to qualify in two consecutive events, Scelzi
voluntarily stepped aside for Bruce Sarver, for whom the Celica was
specifically built, to await a second car for Johnson's team. In the
three weeks after Scelzi stepped aside, Sarver finished second in his
debut in the Celica, and was the No. 1 qualifier in the next two
events.</TE>
<TE>   Scelzi and Johnson parted ways last week, before the Chicagoland
Dodge Dealers NHRA Nationals. Sarver lost in the second round to Gary
Densham, and Scelzi is looking for new opportunities. One of those
opportunities could come with 11-time funny car champion John Force,
who has a three-car team and is working on sponsorship for a fourth
car in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a good stable with three Mustangs, and we may put four
in, but we just don't know yet," Force said.</TE>
<TE>   But Force says he will not hire Scelzi at the expense of
Bellflower's Densham. That's a rumor Force heard after he had offered
Scelzi a chance to test recently, an offer Scelzi declined.</TE>
<TE>   Through 10 of 23 events, Team Force occupies the top three
positions in the funny car standings. Densham, 55, who had never had
a winning record in head-to-head competition until 2001, is leading
in points for the first time in his career. Force, 53, of Yorba
Linda, is second, and Tony Pedregon, 37, of Chino Hills, is third.
They are separated by 75 points.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no different than being Roger Penske or Jack Roush, you're
proud of your people," Force said. "I've done everything you can do.
I'll continue to set records, but I want to set records as a team.
Whether Tony or Densham gets a championship, it doesn't matter, as
long as we get it as a team.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very proud, very honored, to say I made the right choices
with the right people."</TE>

<TE>   The NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Series rolls into Irwindale
Speedway Saturday for the K&amp;N Filters 150, a 75-mile race on the
half-mile oval. It will be the season debut for 2001 champion Craig
Raudman of Bakersfield, who is driving for a new team, Performance
Engineering. Raudman will try to become the sixth winner in six races
this season.</TE>
<TE>   Only four points separate the top three drivers, Eddie McKean of
Jerome, Idaho, with 762 points, Sean Woodside of Saugus with 760, and
Burney Lamar of West Sacramento with 758. Parnelli Jones will drive
the pace car.</TE>

McConnell won his third consecutive main event, finishing the scratch
main ahead of season points leader Josh Larsen of Monrovia and
third-place Scott Brant of Costa Mesa.</TE>

<TE>   The 34th SCORE Tecate Baja 500, which began and ended in Ensenada,
Mexico, last weekend, was dominated by the Class 1 unlimited single-

Troy Herbst of Las Vegas and Larry Roeseler of Hesperia finished
first in 10 hours 24 minutes 56 seconds on the 473.2-mile course;
they were followed by second-place Gary Weyhrich of Troutdale, Ore.,
in 10:32:03, and third-place Andrew Myers of Newport Beach in
10:38:11. The Arizona duo of Mark Miller and Larry Ragland were
fourth overall, and first in the premier trophy truck division, in
10:48:42. American Honda team riders Steve Hengeveld of Oak Hills and
Johnny Campbell of San Clemente together won the overall motorcycle
title by 22 minutes with a time of 9:35:54. It was Campbell's third
victory in the Baja 500.</TE>

<LD>The NBA Finals are a lot bigger in Los Angeles than they are in New
York.</LD>
<LD>   While Game 1 got a 35.4 rating with a 53 share in L.A., New York
managed only a 14.4/23.</LD>
<LD>   Ten markets got a better rating than New York's 14.4. Second
behind L.A. was Memphis with a 17.2.</LD>
<TE>   Chicago, Indianapolis and New Orleans were among the other markets
that got a better rating than New York.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, interest in L.A. seems to be building. Game 1 of the
Western Conference finals against Sacramento got a 17.9/39 in L.A.,
while Game 7 got a 36.9/52.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's game did better in L.A. than Game 1 last year, when
Philadelphia handed the Lakers their only postseason loss. That game
drew a 32.9/51.</TE>
<TE>   However, nationally there was a drop-off. Wednesday's game got a
10.6 national rating with a 20 share, a 15% decrease from the 12.4/23
for Game 1 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Game 1 of the 2000 finals between the Lakers and Indiana drew a
10.5 national rating, the lowest for a Game 1 since 1986.</TE>
<TE>   A rating point represents the percentage of all TV households,
whether television is being watched or not. A share represents the
percentage of TV households where television is being watched.</TE>

<LD>Point guard Jason Kidd scored 23 points, took 10 rebounds and had 10
assists Wednesday against the Lakers in Game 1 of the NBA Finals. It
was a remarkable but fairly predictable performance from Kidd, the
runner-up to San Antonio's Tim Duncan for most-valuable-player honors
this season.</LD>
<LD>   After all, Kidd averaged a triple-double during the Nets' Eastern
Conference finals victory over the Boston Celtics. The Nets and
Lakers can almost count on a repeat showing tonight in Game 2 at
Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   However, the Nets need much more from their supporting cast if
they hope to even the series at a victory apiece before returning to
East Rutherford, N.J., for Game 3 on Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, it would help matters greatly if Kidd had a supporting
cast.</TE>
<TE>   Only power forward Kenyon Martin, who scored 21 points, seemed to
be on his game Wednesday. Small forward Keith Van Horn, shooting
guard Kerry Kittles and reserves Lucious Harris and Richard Jefferson
were all but invisible. The Nets relied on all of them, plus a few
others, to advance to their first NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   But in Game 1, Van Horn missed nine of 14 shots en route to 12
points. Kittles scored nine points, but didn't have much of an impact
on the game. Jefferson, who had four points, and Harris (five on
one-for-five shooting) certainly didn't have the Lakers quaking in
their high tops.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll adjust," Harris said. "Jason was doing what Jason does. We
didn't knock down our shots. We needed to help him out. He did his
job.... I don't think we played in the first quarter the way we've
played all year. Our offense was kind of stagnant. We can't do it
again in Game 2."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Van Horn had a few ideas on how to improve matters for Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, our biggest adjustment is just going to be our
mind-set going into the first quarter," he said, referring to the
29-14 drubbing the Nets took in the opening quarter of Game 1.
"Number two is rebounding the ball and getting it into Jason's hands
a little better. We're not going to underestimate them on the boards
for the rest of the series."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers outrebounded the Nets, 17-10, including by 6-3 on the
offensive end, during the first quarter. By game's end, the Lakers
had a 50-45 rebounding advantage, with center Shaquille O'Neal taking
16.</TE>
<TE>   Getting off to a better start also will be critical for the Nets,
according to Van Horn. Their solid play in the second, third and
fourth quarters could not help them rally from a 23-point deficit in
the first half.</TE>
<TE>   "I know we'll be much better in Game 2,'' Van Horn said. "I feel
confident."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Nets' free-throw shooting was another area they hoped to
improve upon tonight. They missed 11 of 26 from the free-throw line
(57.7%). The Lakers made 32 of 45 (71.1%), with O'Neal making 12 of
21 and Kobe Bryant making 10 of 11.</TE>
<TE>   "We missed a lot of free throws, but I don't think it was
jitters," Harris said. "I'm not concerned about free throws. We just
had a terrible first quarter."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Interrupting a European business trip to return a call, Tom Hicks
took stock of his Texas Rangers and confirmed that he will be
conducting domestic business differently.</LD>
<LD>   The Rangers, riddled by injuries and questionable roster
decisions, and occupying the cellar in the American League West, will
be living within their financial means from now on, Hicks said, and
will rebuild around the still-young Alex Rodriguez with even younger
players.</LD>
<LD>   "The plan was and is to build a championship team by 2004," Hicks
said.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, a cynic might suggest that the Rangers' owner wouldn't
now be talking about two years of losses that will reach $70 million
by the end of the season and cutting $25 million from a $103-million
payroll that is baseball's third highest if he hadn't bid against
himself in giving Rodriguez that 10-year, $252-million contract in
December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   There is no disputing the cynic, but it also can be said that in
the mysterious world of baseball economics, when even the sharpest
minds are confounded trying to justify and equate salary to
performance, Rodriguez might be a bargain.</TE>
<TE>   The one certainty is that A-Rod's production ledger is almost as
impressive as his bank account.</TE>
<TE>   If Cal Ripken Jr. redefined the shortstop position from a size
standpoint, Rodriguez has taken it to an unprecedented level on
offense.</TE>
<TE>   In what amounts to his seventh full season at a still-blossoming
26, Rodriguez continues to expand the position's parameters--and
more.</TE>
<TE>   "If he's not already one of the greatest shortstops ever, he's on
a short list with Ripken," Ranger Manager Jerry Narron said.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said:</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think you'll get much argument that he's the best player
in the game. He's probably the most complete player I've ever seen.
He can hurt you in so many ways.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time he's finished, his offensive numbers are going to fly
by guys who played what are considered to be the more traditional
power positions.</TE>
<TE>   "And what gets lost--because he's such a dominant force on
offense--is the way he plays shortstop, which is almost as incredible
as what he does at the plate."</TE>
<TE>   Before Thursday night's game at Edison Field, Rodriguez was
batting .317 with a league-leading 20 home runs and a major
league-leading 56 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   His home run total projected to 57 and his RBI total to 159.</TE>
<TE>   Both numbers would surpass last year's: 52 homers, the most by a
shortstop or any infielder other than a first baseman, and 135 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez also led the league in runs and total bases and joined
Babe Ruth, Hack Wilson and Jimmie Foxx as the only players with 50 or
more homers and 200 or more hits in a season. He had 201 hits while
becoming only the ninth player to have hit 40 or more homers in four
consecutive seasons.</TE>
<TE>   With 261 homers, eight years left on his contract and more years
likely to follow because he will be only 35 when it expires, the
imagination stretches to Henry Aaron's 755--unless Barry Bonds lifts
that record even higher.</TE>
<TE>   If Rodriguez allows his imagination to stretch that far, he won't
say.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the Seattle Mariners as the first player selected in the
1993 amateur draft, from Miami's Westminster Christian High, and was
tutored in media relations by specialist Andrea Kirby and agent Scott
Boras. No one is more cordial or savvy, but it is difficult
penetrating his PR-PC shield.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, for example, isn't going to say that he already can
spot Aaron on the horizon, or criticize Hicks for retreating
financially or say he made a mistake in leaving the Mariners, who
through Wednesday were 82 games over .500 in the 1 1/3 seasons since
Rodriguez left, whereas the Rangers were 27 games under.</TE>
<TE>   The Boras camp insists the Mariners simply failed to make a
competitive bid or show any real market interest in retaining
Rodriguez, and it's too late to do anything about it now anyway.</TE>
<TE>   If Rodriguez privately has second thoughts, they haven't
interfered with his play.</TE>
<TE>   Nor have the pressures of his contract, the demands of his
position and the heat he has encountered--in Texas and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Shadowing Ripken, Rodriguez was the only major leaguer to play all
162 games last year, and he has played every game this
year--striving, he said, to improve on the little things that are so
important and always working "to master a game that can't be
mastered."</TE>
<TE>   He said he is flattered if Scioscia and others consider him to be
baseball's best player and that his long-term hope--other than
winning a World Series and receiving a Gold Glove in recognition of
his defense--is to maintain the consistency and durability of "great
players and future Hall of Famers" such as Bonds, Roger Clemens,
Edgar Martinez and Rafael Palmeiro.</TE>
<TE>   The journey last year wasn't always easy.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurts when people want to equate me to what's wrong with a
game I love," Rodriguez said. "I put myself in position, through
dedication and hard work, to be rewarded, and suddenly I'm a villain.
A lot of skeptical people thought I'd fail. Last year wasn't easy,
but I'm proud of the way I handled it, being able to build on the
consistency I'd established over the previous years. Most people this
year seem more forgiving and understanding. There's a night-and-day
difference."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez credits fiancee Cynthia Scurtis with providing an
emotional outlet. She is an Ohio State psychology graduate whom he
will marry in November.</TE>
<TE>   Their long-range plan is to open an office where youngsters with
mental problems can receive free assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez also credits Ranger batting coach Rudy Jaramillo with
changing the "infrastructure" of his swing. Once a front-leg hitter,
he's now more balanced, able to wait longer on pitches, and respond
with more power.</TE>
<TE>   "The sky's the limit," Jaramillo said of Rodriguez. "At 26, he
hasn't reached his full development, but he has a desire to excel.
There's no doubt he'll be there with the guys whose numbers are among
the best of the past."</TE>
<TE>   A-Rod already has led the league in hitting once and compiled a
40-40 season of home runs and steals.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a superstar with a utility player's mentality," Narron said.
"He'll do anything to help his club and teammates. If he had zero
skills, you'd want him on your team because of his intangibles."</TE>
<TE>   From London, Hicks agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe the sticker price shocked people," the owner said, "but we
didn't want him for three years, we wanted him for 10. We wanted to
build around him. He's a great player, probably the best in baseball,
with great intangibles, as far as being a leader. He's been under a
lot of pressure, and he's obviously handled it well."</TE>
<TE>   If A-Rod's contributions justify the investment, the rest of the
Ranger portfolio isn't doing as well.</TE>
<TE>   Hicks had to pay a $550,000 tampering fine in the hiring of
General Manager John Hart and assistant Grady Fuson, and maybe that
should have been an omen.</TE>
<TE>   Injuries have played a major role, but the big-ticket acquisitions
of the winter--Chan Ho Park, Juan Gonzalez and Carl Everett--have yet
to pay dividends.</TE>
<TE>   Hicks suggested that in trying to "bridge the gap to our younger
players and [later compensate for the injury wave] we may have lost
sight in a couple cases" of the type character that had made "Alex so
attractive to us."</TE>
<TE>   Hicks definitely was referring to John Rocker, now in the minors,
and probably Everett, among others. Multiyear contracts with no-trade
provisions will make rebuilding difficult, but the housecleaning is
expected to include the free-agency-eligible Palmeiro and Ivan
Rodriguez, possibly as soon as the July trade deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he thought he had been lured to Texas under a false
commitment and promise, Rodriguez shook his head and said he
understood where Hicks was coming from.</TE>
<TE>   He said he believed the owner "has gone into his own pocket for an
incredible amount of money" and that what he is really saying when he
talks about withdrawing some financially is refocusing on players who
have a commitment to winning.</TE>
<TE>   "In this business, and you only have to look at what the Dodgers
are doing this year compared to last year, there's such a quick
turn-around ratio that if we can show him we can still change
directions and improve 10 or 12 games this year, I think that's what
he wants to see more than anything," Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed we haven't played better, but we've also had $50
million or $60 million in players on the disabled list. There's a lot
of baseball left."</TE>
<TE>   And there are areas in which baseball's best and highest-paid
player might get even better, a reassuring thought for Hicks as he
contemplates his Euros and U.S. dollars.</TE>

<HD>Webb Gives Sorenstam Early Challenge at LPGA</HD>

<LD>Ankle-deep rough and brick-hard greens might not be the stiffest
challenges facing Annika Sorenstam in her bid for the second leg of
the Grand Slam.</LD>
<LD>   The real threat Thursday was a familiar name on the leaderboard:
Karrie Webb.</LD>
<LD>   Webb, seemingly in hibernation the first part of the season,
combined power and putting to surge into the lead at the LPGA
Championship, at five under par through 15 holes when thunderstorms
suspended the first round at Wilmington, Del.</LD>
<TE>   "I felt good on the course," Webb said. "The rough is still up and
the greens are just as firm. I'm glad they kept it that way. There's
not one easy shot to play, so that keeps me focused."</TE>
<TE>   The clubhouse leader was Beth Daniel, whose four-under 67 was her
lowest opening round in a major championship in 20 years, dating to a
67 in the 1982 du Maurier Classic.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam, trying to become the first woman in 16 years to win the
first two legs of the Grand Slam, started missing greens on her back
nine and stumbled home to a one-under 70.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always good to be under par at a major," Sorenstam said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're not on your game, it's going to be tough to score out
here."</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, only six players among the early starters managed to
break par.</TE>
<TE>   Lorie Kane of Canada was at three under through 12 holes, and
Natascha Fink of Austria was at three under through 10.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former club pro Ted Goin birdied his last three holes for a
two-under 68 and shared the lead with Tom Kite and journeyman Mike
Smith after the opening round of the PGA Seniors Championship at
Akron, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Goin, a 52-year-old playing his second year on the Senior PGA
Tour, was two over par through seven holes but recovered down the
stretch to get into contention. A 15-year club pro at The Plantation
in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., Goin has made the cut in all 10 senior
tournaments he has played this year.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Tom Watson shot a 69, as did Fuzzy Zoeller, who
is seeking his first victory in his first year on the over-50 tour.
They were joined by Jim Thorpe and Wayne Levi.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Nelson, who won two PGA Championships and a U.S. Open during
the 1980s, was two under through 15 holes but found trouble on the
635-yard 16th. After driving into the right rough, he hit a recovery
shot into the fairway. His third shot rolled through the green before
he chipped to eight feet and missed the par putt. He bogeyed the
closing hole to finish at even-par.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Nicklaus rolled in a 40-foot putt on the 17th to get to
even-par, then three-putted from about the same distance on the last
hole and finished with a 71.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Loren Roberts shot a seven-under 64 and took a one-stroke lead in
the Buick Classic at Harrison, N.Y. Jerry Kelly, Michael Muehr and
Bob Heintz are tied for second.</TE>
<TE>   After playing the first four holes in one over par, Roberts had
nine birdies and a bogey in a 12-hole stretch. On the 17th, he holed
a 20-yard lob.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Smith and David Gossett shot 66s, and Retief Goosen,
preparing for his U.S. Open title defense next week, was three
strokes back at 67 along with Stewart Cink, Steve Elkington, Robert
Allenby, Jim Carter, Pat Perez, John Rollins and Craig Parry.</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Garcia and Ernie Els were in a group at 68.</TE>
<TE>   Pro Football</TE>
<TE>   Andy Katzenmoyer missed the start of the New England Patriots'
minicamp, raising concerns that he may not return after missing last
season because of neck problems.</TE>

<TE>   Linebacker Stephen Boyd, the Detroit Lions' third all-time leading
tackler, is retiring after seven years with the team.</TE>

points in the second half to lead the Seattle Storm to another
comeback win as it beat the Charlotte Sting, 65-59, before 3,927 at
Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Redd, who had been out with a knee injury, played 13 minutes as a
reserve in her first game of the season and helped Seattle to its
franchise-best winning streak of three games.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Bird had 17 points and seven assists for the Storm (3-1). She
made a three-pointer with 6:50 left that broke a 46-46 tie.</TE>

rebounds for the Sting (2-1).</TE>

assists and Sylvia Crawley scored 14 points to lead the Portland Fire
(1-4) past the Sacramento Monarchs, 86-73, before 6,441 at Portland,
Ore. Reserve Ruthie Bolton led the Monarchs (0-2) with 21 points....
Chasity Melvin scored 19 points to lead the Cleveland Rockers (1-1)
to a 72-55 victory over the Detroit Shock (0-5) before 5,957 at
Cleveland. Penny Taylor had 16 points and nine rebounds for the

<HD>Stadium Rival Irks Leiweke</HD>
<DH>Pro football: With Coliseum officials set to announce
$1-million campaign, he says AEG may step aside.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Coliseum officials voting to spend up to $1 million to promote
their venue as an NFL site, the leader of a group trying to bring a
stadium to downtown Los Angeles said Thursday he refuses to be drawn
into a bidding war and threatened to step aside.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the Coliseum Commission, locked in what they see as a
fight for their venue's survival, held a meeting Wednesday during
which they agreed to set aside the money to pay for the
architectural, legal and financial research needed to court an NFL
team.</LD>
<LD>   "This is an investment in our future," said Coliseum General
Manager Pat Lynch, who will hold a news conference today to announce
the expenditure. "We still believe and always will believe, that we
are the most viable site."</LD>
<TE>   The vote marked the latest complication for a plan to build a
privately financed football stadium adjacent to Staples Center that
would house a relocated team, possibly the San Diego Chargers. The
leader of that plan said late Thursday he remains skeptical about the
viability of the Coliseum as an option, but stressed he was
uninterested in a fractious fight.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way we can get the NFL back here is to speak with a
united voice," said Tim Leiweke, president of Anschutz Entertainment
Group. "If somebody has a better vision, we'll get out."</TE>
<TE>   The Coliseum news came a day after AEG received a letter from the
City of San Diego reminding Leiweke that the Chargers have a Qualcomm
Stadium lease, and hinting at legal action if the group tries to lure
the team to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the county Board of Supervisors voted to sue the city,
arguing that a redevelopment plan that would ease the way for stadium
construction ultimately strips tax revenue from the county. Although
county leaders have expressed support for bringing a pro team to the
Coliseum, they insist the legal action is not aimed at derailing the
downtown stadium proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke said Thursday that the group will continue to pursue a
stadium in South Park but the recent setbacks have been
disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   "Have we lost our gut, our vision, our enthusiasm? No," he added.
"But we are a little surprised that we have lawsuits being filed,
committees being formed, other sites being offered, and that is an
invitation for Los Angeles to be absolutely played. That makes a very
difficult process almost impossible. We went through that last time.
If I'm not mistaken, it's called the Houston Texans."</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke was referring to the complications that mired the last
efforts to bring a team to Los Angeles in 1999. Houston billionaire
Bob McNair offered $700 million for the league's 32nd franchise,
outbidding competing Los Angeles groups.</TE>
<TE>   Many people, including high-ranking NFL executives, have ruled out
the Coliseum as an option. Those critics cite, among other things,
insufficient parking, and the prohibitive cost and red tape involved
with remodeling a historic landmark.</TE>
<TE>   Some at the NFL have also dismissed the Coliseum's funding plan as
overly optimistic and impractical. By contrast, the group backing the
downtown proposal is made up of billionaires, including Denver-based
Philip Anschutz, who owns Staples Center. Coliseum backers say they
understand the shortcomings of their stadium proposal but don't see
them as insurmountable.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not believe for a host of reasons that anybody will be able
to build a stadium better, quicker and more cost effectively than the
Coliseum," said Los Angeles City councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, also
a member of the Coliseum Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch took issue with Leiweke's comments that public funds would
be used to research the viability of the Coliseum. The studies would
augment those done in the late 1990s, when Los Angeles was vying for
an expansion team.</TE>
<TE>   "They aren't tax dollars," Lynch said. "We are spending money we
have accumulated with our earnings."</TE>
<TE>   Coliseum backers insist they are determined to look deeper into
the issue, pointing to the fact that all eight Coliseum Commission
members in attendance voted in favor of allocating those funds.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the Coliseum Commission doesn't allocate $1 million
willy-nilly to projects," said County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, a
member of the Coliseum Commission. "This is a serious step."</TE>

<HD>Red Wings Strike Like a Hurricane</HD>
<DH>Stanley Cup finals: Detroit scores two goals 13 seconds
apart in third period to win, 3-1, and tie series with Carolina.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>It wasn't exactly panic time, but the Detroit Red Wings understood
that they would be in trouble if they lost to Carolina in Game 2 of
the Stanley Cup finals Thursday night at Joe Louis Arena.</LD>
<LD>   After losing Game 1 Tuesday in overtime, the last thing Detroit
wanted was another tight, low-scoring game against the Hurricanes.
But that's exactly what the Red Wings got, finding themselves tied
with Carolina late in the third period.</LD>
<LD>   Then, in a flash, Detroit broke the game open with goals from
Nicklas Lidstrom and Kris Draper 13 seconds apart to give the Red
Wings a 3-1 victory in front of a standing-room-only crowd of 20,058.</LD>
<TE>   "We knew coming in [that Carolina was going to be tough] with the
way they had played in the other series," said Detroit Coach Scotty
Bowman, whose team finished the regular season with 25 more points
than the Hurricanes. "They have been very stingy, especially all
through the playoffs. They haven't given up many goals, so this was a
typical game."</TE>
<TE>   After going scoreless on six power plays during the first two
periods, the Red Wings finally figured out how to break through
Carolina's smothering defense and goaltender Arturs Irbe with the man
advantage.</TE>
<TE>   With Carolina winger Martin Gelinas in the penalty box for
slashing, Lidstrom blasted home his fifth goal of the playoffs from
the right circle, giving Detroit a 2-1 lead at 14:52. Carolina, which
finished with 28 blocked shots compared to Detroit's five, gave
Lidstrom just enough room to sneak the puck past Irbe.</TE>
<TE>   "They're good at blocking shots and it is tough getting the puck
to the net," said Lidstrom, who played a game-high 34 minutes and 38
seconds. "Sergei [Fedorov] did a great job of getting the puck to me
and I shot it high and it went in."</TE>
<TE>   In Game 1, Detroit led by a goal twice, only to have Carolina
rally to tie. That didn't happen Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   On the shift after Lidstrom's goal, Draper sneaked behind the
Hurricane defense and ripped a shot past Irbe from the left wing,
giving the Red Wings a commanding two-goal lead with 4:45 left.</TE>
<TE>   "For 55 minutes, you didn't know how the game was going [to end],"
said Detroit goaltender Dominik Hasek, who didn't face a lot of shots
but made his 16 saves count. "It was big for us to score when we
did."</TE>
<TE>   Carolina, which will play host to Game 3 on Saturday, dominated
the first five minutes but was unable to capitalize on two early
power-play opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   With the game still scoreless, Detroit found the net first with a
short-handed goal. Kirk Maltby charged into Carolina's zone and
skated into the right circle, where he blasted a goal past Irbe to
give the Red Wings a 1-0 lead at 6:13.</TE>
<TE>   For the next several minutes, Detroit controlled the flow of the
game and came close to taking a two-goal lead. Boyd Devereaux, Brett
Hull, Steve Yzerman, Fedorov and Chris Chelios each had great scoring
chances but couldn't get the puck past Irbe.</TE>
<TE>   Then with the Red Wings on a power play, Carolina's Rod
Brind'Amour single-handedly tied the score with a brilliant steal and
goal. Detroit defenseman Fredrik Olausson had his pass picked off by
Brind'Amour outside the Red Wing blue line, and then the Hurricane
veteran beat Hasek with a nifty move to tie the score at 1-1 at
14:47.</TE>
<TE>   That's how the score remained until Lidstrom's winning goal in the
third period.</TE>
<TE>   "He just seems to have so much endurance with the way he plays,"
Bowman said about Lidstrom, who finished with 32 shifts and four
shots on goal. "We made a change on [the power play] by putting him
on the umbrella on the right side. He always had a good one-timer and
played a lot of right defenseman.</TE>
<TE>   "It was rewarding for him to score because of the way he played.
He killed penalties, played even strength and for the most part, he
was out against [Ron] Francis, [Jeff] O'Neill and [Sami] Kapanen most
of the night."</TE>

<HD>Trottier to Coach Rangers</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bryan Trottier has always had a knack for making headlines during the
Stanley Cup finals.</LD>
<LD>   The Hockey Hall of Famer is doing it again in New York.</LD>
<LD>   Trottier, one of the Islanders' greatest players and a seven-time
Stanley Cup winner, was hired Thursday to coach the archrival
Rangers.</LD>
<TE>   How he will be received by fans of both teams remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   "As of right now, my loyalty and my focus is with the New York
Rangers," he said. "I believe sports fans understand that both on
Long Island and New York."</TE>
<TE>   Trottier, 45, replaces Ron Low, fired after the regular season,
the fifth straight time the Rangers failed to make the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Trottier has been an assistant coach with the Colorado Avalanche
since 1998 and spent three seasons as an assistant with the
Pittsburgh Penguins. His only head coaching experience was with
Portland of the AHL in the 1997-98 season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The NHL is considering ways to make its 30 arenas safer for fans
following the death of a 13-year-old girl three months ago at a game
in Columbus, Ohio, Commissioner Gary Bettman said.</TE>
<TE>   The commissioner said a report prepared by engineers, architects
and safety inspectors would be discussed at a meeting of the league's
board of governors on June 20 in Toronto. Bettman wouldn't elaborate
on possible new or additional safety measures, which may include
netting or higher glass behind the nets at each end of the rink.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Mighty Ducks signed prospect Mark Popovic and unrestricted
free agent Kurt Sauer to three-year entry level contracts. Popovic, a
19-year-old defenseman, was a second-round pick in the 2001 draft.
Sauer, a 21-year-old defenseman, was a fifth-round selection by
Colorado in the 2000 draft and spent three seasons in the minor
leagues. The Avalanche did not re-sign Sauer, making him available.</TE>

<LD>Tom Glavine became the National League's second 10-game winner,
joining Arizona's Curt Schilling, by pitching seven strong innings as
the Atlanta Braves completed a sweep of the New York Mets with a 3-2
victory Thursday at Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   The Braves won for the ninth time in 11 games, including three in
a row over the Mets. The other game in the series was rained out.</LD>
<LD>   Glavine (10-2) won his fifth consecutive start, giving up seven
hits and both New York runs. He struggled in the early innings but
retired the last nine hitters he faced to reach 10 victories at the
earliest point of his career.</LD>
<TE>   Cincinnati 3, St. Louis 2--Ken Griffey Jr. homered for the first
time since his comeback from a serious knee injury, and Barry Larkin
drove in two runs as the Reds won at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Graves escaped a bases-loaded, one-out threat in the ninth
inning and Cincinnati won the last game of the rain-shortened series.</TE>

<HD>He Put New in Jersey</HD>
<DH>What's a little one-game deficit to Byron Scott after he
turned the Nets into winners?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You think this is tough?</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks ago, Byron Scott's New Jersey Nets blew a 21-point
fourth-quarter lead over the Celtics, setting a playoff record and
obliging them to sit around Boston for two miserable days, trying to
find something on TV that didn't show them gagging.</LD>
<LD>   Then in their next game, they blew a 15-point lead. But did they
run away or lose heart?</LD>
<TE>   N-o-o-o-o.</TE>
<TE>   So what if they're 0-1 in the NBA Finals? Nobody ever believed in
them, anyway ... they had nothing to lose and now they've got even
less ... it's early, etc., etc.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Scott hits the ground talking. That was the first
thing anyone noticed when he took over the Nets, a black hole for
dreams as well as coaches, five of them having passed through in
eight seasons. He announced the start of a new era, along with new
standards for his players, even the adored, feared and previously
inviolate Stephon Marbury.</TE>
<TE>   This was the same Byron Scott who'd had to be dragged to pep
rallies at Morningside High in Inglewood. His coach, Carl Franklin,
says he was too shy to get up and talk.</TE>
<TE>   Scott says he wasn't that shy, although everything else is true.</TE>
<TE>   "I was, you know, 17, 18, 16 years old," he says. "I didn't
particularly like ... having to talk to a bunch of people and having
everybody kind of look at me and figure out what I was trying to say,
what point I was trying to get across.</TE>
<TE>   "He was right about that, I didn't like it."</TE>
<TE>   Scott was 22 when he came back to town as a Laker, now brash
enough to have said something about wanting to be the next Magic
Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Because the original was here and already upset, because they had
traded his buddy, Norm Nixon, for the rookie Scott, this wasn't the
right thing to say.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson and Michael Cooper put Scott through a hell week that
lasted longer than a week. He bore it without complaint until one day
when he squared off on Cooper in practice and the veterans decided he
had passed the initiation.</TE>
<TE>   So began Scott's 10 Laker seasons, which yielded titles in three
of the first five. Viewed as Johnson's little brother, he was
actually a tough guy on the floor and brutally candid off it,
although he had little interest in the star/interview process. This
made him rare, indeed, a player with a showy game, which he kept
under tight rein, and a lot of personality, which remained submerged.</TE>
<TE>   Let go in 1993, he returned for a last Laker hurrah in 1996 as an
elder statesman with a new sense of purpose, having been encouraged
by Larry Brown in Indiana to go into coaching. The personality was
surfacing: The two Byrons, the brash one and the shy one, were
becoming one.</TE>
<TE>   Now he's back at 41 for the ultimate homeboy's triumph as a young
star of the profession, having actually turned the swamp things
around.</TE>
<TE>   He says he can't find the words to describe it. He hugs Johnson in
the hallway before Game 1, promotes former teammate James Worthy for
the Hall of Fame, exchanges compliments with his former pupil, Kobe
Bryant. He sneers at people who don't think his Nets have a
chance--basically everyone except the Nets--and says he's thrilled at
the chance to "match wits with Phil Jackson."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for Scott, he's matching players with Jackson, as
much as wits, and Jackson has the biggest one.</TE>
<TE>   But it isn't over yet ... they only need to steal one here ...
they hung in there against Shaquille O'Neal in Game 1, etc., etc..</TE>
<TE>   If you don't believe it, you know whom you can ask.</TE>
<TE>   The Un-haunting of the Nets</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if there was ever a franchise that needed a
tough-talking spokesman with more than a hint of swagger, this was
it.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets were the orphans of the New York metropolitan area, born
in Teaneck, N.J., having migrated to Long Island, then back to
Piscataway, N.J., to play in Rutgers' arena even if it was halfway to
Trenton, and finally to the Meadowlands.</TE>
<TE>   They won an ABA title before owner Roy Boe sold Julius Erving to
Philadelphia in 1977 just as they joined the NBA, launching a
rebuilding phase that lasted until now, featuring do-nothing owners
(the Secaucus Seven), miscast messiahs (Derrick Coleman, Marbury) and
luck so bad, they were said to be cursed.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Scott, arriving in the fall of 2000, was buying into that
curse stuff.</TE>
<TE>   However, by the spring of 2001, after injuries had wrecked his
rookie season as a coach, he was starting to wonder.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Van Horn, scorned by Marbury, had missed 33 games and
Marbury 15. Kendall Gill, counted on for veteran leadership, had
missed 51. Kerry Kittles had sat out the entire season. Kenyon
Martin, their promising No. 1 pick, had come in recovering from a leg
injury and got up to speed only at the end.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets had gone 26-56 and upper management reportedly had told
the basketball operation to dump some or all of the big salaries.</TE>
<TE>   Scott, who patterned himself after his taskmaster Laker coach, Pat
Riley, blames himself for the injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "I was Riley-esque in my training camp," he says. "I mean, our
practices were 2 1/2, three hours. We did a lot of running. You know,
I really kind of looked back at that and said that most of that, most
of our injuries occurred because of me....</TE>
<TE>   "That's what you do as a rookie coach. You try to put your stamp
on your team and I had to learn the hard way."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, just to be on the safe side, he asked his stepfather, a
lay minister, to come to New Jersey to say a blessing over the
Meadowlands.</TE>
<TE>   His stepfather couldn't make it out but did it over the phone.</TE>
<TE>   "He just told me over the phone that he was going to bless the
arena, the swamp, you know, just make sure we wouldn't have any
injuries," Scott said. "And, obviously, the man above blessed this
team tremendously and we didn't have those major injuries."</TE>
<TE>   How neat was that? Blessings over the phone, courtesy of AT&amp;T and
the man upstairs.</TE>
<TE>   The man in Phoenix, Sun owner Jerry Colangelo, also helped
immeasurably by sending them Jason Kidd for Marbury, changing their
chemistry overnight.</TE>
<TE>   They doubled their win total to 52, won the Atlantic Division
title, advanced past Indiana and Charlotte and split the first two
games with the Celtics in the East finals.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in the pivotal Game 3 in the FleetCenter, they took that
21-point lead into the fourth quarter....</TE>
<TE>   Deja Vu All Over Again</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Scott had had more than one misadventure in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   In his rookie season, the Lakers led the Celtics in the last
minute of each of the first four games. The Celtics stole two of
them, including Game 2 when Gerald Henderson intercepted Worthy's
in-bounds pass, and won the series, running their postseason record
against the Lakers to 7-0.</TE>
<TE>   The next spring, the Lakers, said to be cursed themselves, lost
the opener, 148-114, in what became known as "the Memorial Day
Massacre," after which Riley scorched them, they won Game 2 and went
on to take the series.</TE>
<TE>   Scott told his Nets that story, whereupon they lost that 15-point
lead, saw the Celtics tie them in the closing seconds, then gutted
out the win and took the series in six.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just one game," Scott says. "We lost the big lead and we
lost Game 3--we made history with the way we lost that game--but it
was just one loss....</TE>
<TE>   "Our objective when we started that round was to get one win and
we still had one game left to play. Our guys understood that and they
played the next game with a vengeance."</TE>
<TE>   It was a harrowing series, with emotions flowing in all directions
and the teams trading jibes.</TE>
<TE>   "Beat L.A." T-shirts were seen in Boston. Celtic fans sitting
courtside stomped after the referees, jeered their own players and
taunted Kidd's wife. The soft-spoken Kidd taunted them back from the
floor after Game 4, later noting, "Now, this is serious."</TE>
<TE>   Having survived, the Nets felt themselves to be a team of destiny,
although that theory is being put to an extreme test.</TE>
<TE>   It's a wild time. Team President Rod Thorn was named executive of
the year, but Kidd ran second in the MVP balloting and Scott third in
the coach-of-the-year race. (Being Scott, he didn't just admit he was
disappointed, he said he thought he should have won it.) Their future
looks sparkly, but Kidd, a free agent next summer, refuses to commit
to staying.</TE>
<TE>   There's even speculation in New Jersey that Scott could be the
Laker heir apparent in 2005, when Phil Jackson's contract runs out.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I have a dream job right now," Scott said Thursday. "I
think this job I have in New Jersey is one of the best jobs in the
NBA. I have the best point guard in Jason Kidd, I have a great staff,
owners, president....</TE>
<TE>   "The players are young and they're going to get better. So the job
I have right now is to me a dream job."</TE>
<TE>   Well, right now he actually has his hands full, but on the other
hand, 27 other coaches are sitting at home, envying him.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Ainge, Scott's old Celtic adversary, recently called him
"without question ... the best player never to make an All-Star
team." When the Bergen Record's Adrian Wojnarowski relayed the
compliment to Scott, his eyes welled up.</TE>
<TE>   It has been that kind of season and it isn't over yet, either. Ask
Scott, who has absolutely no problem getting his point across these
days.</TE>

<LD>Ottavio Cinquanta was elected to a third consecutive term as
president of the International Skating Union by acclamation Friday,
affirming his mandate to develop the reform project he backed during
the organization's biennial Congress.</LD>
<LD>   "We are not in the best moment, but we have given evidence we are
proactive and responsible," he said, referring to the Salt Lake City
Olympic judging scandal and the ISU's resulting decision to change
its judging process.</LD>
<LD>   David Dore of Canada upset Katsuichiro Hasanaga of Japan for
second vice president, figure skating. Gerhard Zimmermann of Germany
was reelected first vice president, speed skating.</LD>
<TE>   In the only significant victory for the U.S. Figure Skating Assn.
this week, its president, Phyllis Howard, was elected a member of the
ISU Council. Also elected as figure skating Council members were
Marie Lundmark of Finland, Tjasa Andree-Prosenc of Slovenia and
Courtney Jones of Great Britain.</TE>

<DH>Figure skating: ISU Congress votes to expand judging panels
to 14 and use only nine randomly selected scores.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KYOTO, Japan</DL>
<LD>Figure skating took its first meaningful step toward reform Thursday,
adopting a Canadian proposal to expand judging panels to 14 at
international events and program a computer to randomly select nine
scores that will determine competitors' results in each phase of
competitions.</LD>
<LD>   But after wading through two hours of rhetoric at the end of a
tedious day, few delegates at the International Skating Union
Congress fully understood what they had done--and none would predict
the long-term effects.</LD>
<LD>   "Have they got it?" one high-ranking official said as she
circulated among clusters of delegates.</LD>
<TE>   Probably not. At one point, undecided whether to rank skaters by
total points, average score or median mark, they considered reverting
to the scoring system used a decade ago, before the One by One system
was adopted to rank skaters in comparison to other skaters. After
much backtracking and posturing, that was rejected and Skate Canada's
proposal was approved, 39-8, with three abstentions.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Figure Skating Assn., whose proposal to rank skaters by a
median mark was rejected, 35-15, voted against Canada's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody agreed we should be doing something," said Israeli
delegate Judith Javor, "but at the same time, they were frightened of
change. There's no law that says change will be better."</TE>
<TE>   But change was inevitable, spurred by ISU President Ottavio
Cinquanta's declaration the sport is in crisis and must dispel the
perception--and too often the reality--that results are tainted by
bloc voting and deal making by judges.</TE>
<TE>   It was on his recommendation that the International Olympic
Committee awarded duplicate gold medals to pairs skaters Jamie Sale
and David Pelletier of Canada, after improprieties in the judging of
the event threatened to consume the Salt Lake City Games. And it was
because he insisted the Congress chart a new course before dissolving
today that debate raged through the dinner hour Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the IOC shall be satisfied, because within a few months
we acted," said Cinquanta, who today was elected to a third four-year
term in office. "Nobody can say the ISU under President Cinquanta has
done nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Three days after approving the study of an ISU project that would
overhaul the scoring and judging systems, the Congress created a
transitional shelter between the methods that gave them a black eye
at Salt Lake City and the ISU's radical plan. Cinquanta said his pet
project could be tested "in a very discreet manner" next February or
March and launched in two years, but nervous delegates weren't ready
for that leap.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, it's best to go step by step," said Sally Anne
Stapleford of Britain, chair of the influential figure skating
technical committee. "It wasn't how we calculated judges' marks that
was the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a mathematician, but if you have 14 judges and choose
nine, five make the decision [as a majority]. That's a concern. But
at least the judges won't know who's being used. At the end, we got a
result, and that was the main aim of the day, wasn't it?"</TE>
<TE>   That result was surprising, because Canada's proposal had been
overshadowed by bold initiatives from the U.S. and Australia.</TE>
<TE>   The USFSA median mark plan was soundly defeated despite vigorous
campaigning. Its early support vanished after Slovakia delegate
Felicitas Babusikova, projecting a table of theoretical results onto
a screen, claimed the method would produce unjust finishes.</TE>
<TE>   The table, which also poked holes in Australia's proposal, caught
USFSA officials unprepared. Not even their withdrawal of a provision
calling for the random selection of seven judges' scores from
10-judge panels could salvage their cause.</TE>
<TE>   "We would have preferred to see a more clear attempt at change,"
said USFSA President Phyllis Howard. "We do think we did provide some
real impetus for change. People heard our message."</TE>
<TE>   Australia's proposal was similar to Canada's, but its idea to drop
the two high and two low scores was shunned by delegates who believed
it left too much power in the hands of too few judges.</TE>

including me. I was one of many who considered O'Neal's free-throw
shooting as the Lakers' biggest weakness heading into the playoffs.
That's not true any more.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal has been making free throws with so much confidence, the
Lakers are assured points almost every time they get the ball into
him near the basket. O'Neal not only has improved his shooting from
the line, he also has developed a nice array of jump hooks, which
include bank shots.</LD>
<LD>   The New Jersey Nets know that in order to upset the Lakers in the
best-of-seven NBA Finals, they will have to do a better job slowing
O'Neal, who dominated Game 1 with 36 points, 16 rebounds and four
blocked shots</LD>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson's decision to have Robert Horry defend Kenyon
Martin and put Rick Fox on Keith Van Horn worked to perfection for
the Lakers in Game 1. Now it's up to Coach Byron Scott to make a few
changes for the Nets, who did not help themselves by shooting 39.4%
from the field and only 57.7% from the free-throw line Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   A breakdown of tonight's Game 2 at Staples Center:</TE>
<TE>   NETS' MOVE--New Jersey should use more pick-and-roll plays with
point guard Jason Kidd tonight, but operate them closer to the
basket. Kidd is a streak shooter at best from the three-point line,
but he's pretty accurate from the 12- to 15-foot range. The Nets have
to realize that O'Neal is just as inconsistent defending
pick-and-roll plays set at the free-throw line as he is when they are
run farther out.</TE>
<TE>   Center Todd MacCulloch may have looked bad at times in Game 1, but
he provided some good production with 10 points and eight rebounds,
including six offensive boards, in only 25 minutes. A bigger problem
for New Jersey was the inconsistent play of forwards Van Horn and
Martin, who combined to shoot 12 for 36 from the field.</TE>
<TE>   Van Horn made two three-pointers at the start of the second half,
but mostly Fox made his night miserable. Van Horn, taller and heavier
than Fox, has to play his game and use his size more.</TE>
<TE>   Martin had trouble early on but he was more effective in the
second half when he began taking the ball to the basket. If the
Lakers continue to assign Horry to defend Martin, the Net power
forward can't just stand on the perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   LAKERS' MOVE--Obviously, Los Angeles' biggest problem is staying
focused. The Lakers should know by now that they cannot afford to
fall in love with the three-point shot. They missed nine of 10
attempts Wednesday. Even with O'Neal in the middle, players such as
Fisher, Fox and Horry have to keep attacking and not settle for jump
shots.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers also have to remember to always get back on defense
against the Nets. The more outside shots they take means more long
rebounds, which often feed New Jersey fastbreaks. The Lakers are
two-time defending champions because they've been able to take away
the strengths of their opponents.</TE>
<TE>   After building a 23-point lead in the first half, the Lakers lost
their concentration. Jackson and his coaching staff have to stay on
their up-and-down players at all times against the Nets. The worst
thing the Lakers can do is make this a knock-down, drag-out type of
series.</TE>
<TE>   KEY POINT--Tempo is so important for both teams. If the flow is
fast, the advantage goes to the Nets. If the pace is more methodical,
the Lakers have the edge.</TE>
<TE>   In Game 1, New Jersey's defense was too soft. The Lakers were able
to move around their offensive sets without much resistance. Not only
did O'Neal get post position whenever he wanted, but so did the rest
of the Lakers. The Nets can't allow this to happen in Game 2. They
have to be more physical and move their feet to get into better
positions on defense.</TE>
<TE>   Based on how New Jersey played in the second half on Wednesday,
the Lakers should expect a better start from the Nets tonight. Scott
threw more players at O'Neal and had them clog up the paint, which is
something the Lakers should expect the remainder of the series.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It will be announced next week that Marv Albert will be TNT's lead
NBA play-by-play announcer next season, probably paired with Mike
Fratello. Albert will work one of TNT's Thursday night doubleheader
games each week, plus the All-Star game and the playoffs, including
the Western Conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   The conference finals will all be on cable next season, when the
NBA's new TV contract kicks in.</LD>
<LD>   Albert on Thursday said he couldn't offer any details about his
new deal but said he was thrilled with the prospect of remaining in
the Turner family.</LD>
<TE>   Bill Walton is likely headed for ABC-ESPN and is expected to be
paired with Brad Nessler or Brent Musburger on the No. 1 NBA
announcing team.</TE>
<TE>   Snapper Returns</TE>
<TE>   Steve "Snapper" Jones will rejoin Albert and Walton for Game 2 of
the NBA Finals after missing Game 1 because of his daughter's high
school graduation.</TE>
<TE>   As for Jones' future status, he said, "When we finish the season,
we'll go from there. It's week to week."</TE>
<TE>   Said Walton: "My contract is word to word."</TE>
<TE>   Retorted Bob Costas: "You must be the wealthiest guy this side of
Bill Gates."</TE>
<TE>   Amazing Weekend</TE>
<TE>   Just think what's on tab this weekend. The NBA Finals, War Emblem
going for a Triple Crown in Saturday's Belmont Stakes, the finals of
the French Open, and the Senior PGA Championship--all on NBC, plus
World Cup soccer, the Stanley Cup finals, the Buick Classic, the LPGA
McDonald's Championship, interleague baseball and more.</TE>
<TE>   Oh yes, there's also that pay-per-view fight in Memphis, Tenn.,
between Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   In case anyone is interested, the $54.95 telecast, a joint
production between HBO and Showtime, is available in 50 million homes
in the U.S., plus another 500 million in 130 other countries.</TE>
<TE>   HBO's Jim Lampley and Showtime's Bobby Czyz will call the fight.
HBO's James Brown is the host, Showtime's Jim Gray the reporter.</TE>
<TE>   This will be a particularly busy weekend for Gray, who will stop
off in Memphis after working tonight's Game 2 of the NBA Finals for
NBC and then head on to New Jersey for Game 3 Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Of the fight, Gray said: "You would have to say that on either
fighter's best day, Mike Tyson is the better fighter. However, we
have not seen Mike Tyson's best day for almost a decade."</TE>
<TE>   A Great Moment</TE>
<TE>   Tom Hammond, the host of NBC's coverage of the Belmont, said,
"This is the ultimate for thoroughbred racing. It's maybe one of the
most exciting moments that a sports fan can experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the last Triple Crown in 1978 when Affirmed beat Alydar
may be the greatest race of all time; certainly the greatest one I've
seen. The anticipation leading up to the race and then the moment
when they turn for home will be something special."</TE>
<TE>   ESPY Nominations</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson may not have received any votes for NBA coach of the
year, but when the ESPY nominations were announced in Hollywood this
week, Jackson was the only coach from the NBA in the coach of the
year category.</TE>
<TE>   And Shaquille O'Neal was the only NBA player in the best male
athlete category.</TE>
<TE>   The ESPY Awards will be televised live from the new Kodak Theater
in Hollywood on July 10.</TE>
<TE>   Another Sports Channel</TE>
<TE>   Plans have been in the works for some time now to launch the
Tennis Channel--the channel has already lined up seven women's
tournaments--and now comes word of a College Sports Network, expected
to go on the air sometime early next year.</TE>
<TE>   The channel is the brainchild of Brian Bedol and Steve Greenberg,
co-founders of the Classic Sports Network, which is now ESPN Classic.
Their new channel will focus on the more minor college sports.</TE>
<TE>   Eye Trouble</TE>
<TE>   ESPN's Stuart Scott is back to work and covering the NBA Finals
but says he is facing more eye surgery because of an injury suffered
April 3 while working out with the New York Jets.</TE>
<TE>   Scott, a high school football star, was preparing to do a
three-part series on what it's like to go through a mini-camp when he
was hit in his left eye by a football thrown by a high-powered
pass-throwing machine. It split the cornea and lens. What was
particularly scary was that Scott suffered a detached retina in his
right eye in 1989 after getting hit with a basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "I was using only my left eye," he said before Game 1 Wednesday.
Since the mishap, he has had to use his right.</TE>
<TE>   He said he now sees well enough out of his left eye to read a
teleprompter, but his vision in that eye is not what it used to be.
That's why he's facing more surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   The U.S.'s next World Cup game, against co-host South Korea, will
be televised live on ESPN2 at 11:30 p.m. Sunday. A replay of the
U.S.'s victory over Portugal will be shown by ESPN Classic Saturday
at 6 p.m.... ESPN got a 2.85 national rating for Game 1 of the
Stanley Cup finals Tuesday. The telecast was the network's
most-viewed and highest-rated NHL contest in nearly three years, and
its best finals' opener ever, but the L.A. rating was only a 0.7....
Good sign for baseball: Fox, which began its Saturday baseball
coverage last weekend , averaged a 2.7 national rating with a 9
share, a slight increase over last year's opening weekend average of
2.5/8.... NBC probably won't get much of a rating for the men's final
from the French Open on the West Coast. It's being shown here live at
6 a.m. Saturday's women's final will be on at a more respectable 8
a.m.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN recently fired Jason Jackson for violations of company
policy. Word is it was for sexual harassment. "I did not sexually
harass anyone," Jackson told the Miami Herald, although he admitted
he made "comments that had sexual overtones on occasion--me being my
colorful self at times. My wife said I should change that." Jackson,
who was on both TV and radio, had been at ESPN since 1995.... ESPN
has canceled "Unscripted With Chris Connelly." It will go off the air
June 28.... ESPN's "Mohr Sports" moves to a new time slot--Tuesdays
at 5 p.m.--next week.</TE>
<TE>   Aileen Eaton, the late legendary L.A. boxing promoter, will be the
topic of tonight's "Life and Times" show on Channel 28 at 7. Son Mike
LaBell and rival promoter Don Fraser will be the featured guests.
Eaton is being inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame
posthumously this weekend.... Harvey Schiller, former president of
Turner Sports and former executive director of the U.S. Olympic
Committee, has been named president and chief executive officer of
Assante's U.S. operations. Assante is a Canadian sports management
company.</TE>
<TE>   Radio Daze</TE>
<TE>   As one might expect, local sports-talk radio stations have been
giving blanket coverage to the Lakers.... Besides regular
contributors Alvin Gentry and Brian Scalabrine, Arnie Spanier's guest
on KXTA (1150) Thursday included Shaquille O'Neal, Elgin Baylor and
David Stern.... KXTA has been airing a "Laker Insider" show with Rich
Marotta and Marques Johnson from noon-3 p.m. for more than a week. It
sure beats the "Kiley and Booms" Fox network show.... On today's
"Laker Insider," Spanier will fill in for Marotta, who has a boxing
commitment. Tonight at 9, Marotta will do a special "Neutral Corner"
show previewing the Tyson-Lewis fight, and then he'll do a special
post-fight show Saturday night at Yankee Doodles in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Joe McDonnell and Doug Krikorian were planning to be back at the
Fox Sky Box restaurant at Staples Center today from 1-5 p.m., but
McDonnell said Clear Channel, which owns Laker flagship station KLAC
(570), claimed that was an infringement of its radio rights.</TE>

<HD>Tyson Has Been Behaving Like Southern Gentleman</HD>
<DH>Boxing: Memphis sees a different side of the controversial
former champion as he prepares for fight against Lewis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEMPHIS, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Here on the banks of the Mississippi River, far from his big-city
roots, in the town where the civil-rights movement underwent one of
its darkest moments 34 years ago, Mike Tyson has found what he claims
he has been looking for all his life: love, gratitude and support.</LD>
<LD>   Who knew?</LD>
<LD>   As Tyson entered the Cook Convention Center in downtown Memphis on
Thursday afternoon to weigh in for Saturday's heavyweight title match
against champion Lennox Lewis, marchers walked back and forth outside
with signs.</LD>
<TE>   Signs of appreciation for Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   One read, "Thanks Mike, For Saying It's OK To Be Gay."</TE>
<TE>   Another read, "Tyson Opposes Homophobia."</TE>
<TE>   The genesis of this sentiment came Sunday when Tyson stepped out
of a van in front of the Six50 Fit Club in suburban Cordova for a
workout. In his path was local resident Jim Maynard, who was holding
up a sign protesting Tyson's tendency to demean opponents by
referring to them as homosexuals.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson gave Maynard a smile, a hug and told him, "I'm not
homophobic. My remarks are not aimed at gay people."</TE>
<TE>   That's all it took, apparently, for Tyson to become a hero to the
local gay community.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an unlikely statement coming from Mike Tyson," said Beth
Good, who held up one of the signs of support Thursday. "It's a good
step, one more athletes need to take."</TE>
<TE>   Said Maynard: "He needs a positive reward for what he said. But he
still needs to address his views toward women. He needs to be
absolved of his sins."</TE>
<TE>   After a Wednesday workout, Tyson agreed to take questions from a
group of schoolchildren and answered in a friendly, accommodating
manner.</TE>
<TE>   When Tyson stepped on the scales to be weighed Thursday, a women
from the audience yelled, "I love you, Mike."</TE>
<TE>   A male voice chimed in, "I love you too."</TE>
<TE>   So too, apparently, do many of the local citizens, who flock
whenever there is a Tyson sighting. At least they love the potential
income and attention Tyson has brought to this city, whose biggest
tourist attractions have been the National Civil Rights Museum,
located on the site of the Lorraine Motel, where Martin Luther King
was assassinated in 1968, and Graceland, home of favorite son Elvis
Presley.</TE>
<TE>   But this week, the town is decorated in red, white and black, the
colors of the Lewis-Tyson signs that can be seen everywhere from
lampposts to store windows, from shirts and caps to buttons and bows.</TE>
<TE>   In welcoming the crowd to Thursday's weigh-in, Memphis Mayor
Willie Herenton said this would be the "greatest boxing event of all
time."</TE>
<TE>   The excitement has even spread to the neighboring state of
Mississippi, where news conferences for the two fighters were held at
casinos in Tunica County.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years ago, Tunica was the poorest county in the nation. The
Rev. Jesse Jackson labeled it "America's Ethiopia." But Tuesday and
Wednesday, the Tunica casinos, which have revived the local economy,
spared no expense or ingenuity in trying to impress the national
media.</TE>
<TE>   Lamp chops with mint jelly and veal scaloppine highlighted an
elaborate menu. Carlos Harbert, a 13-year-old chess whiz from
Oakhaven School, played a match against Lewis, a chess fanatic, with
the cameras clicking away. The match wasn't completed, but Harbert
was given the decision amid smiles and laughter.</TE>
<TE>   That has been the tone in these days leading up to the fight. The
majority of the boxing world may regard Tyson as a bully, an ogre,
mentally disturbed or all of the preceding. People may have trouble
forgetting that he bit off a piece of Evander Holyfield's right ear
in a bout five years ago. They may have been revolted when Tyson bit
into Lewis' upper left thigh during a brawl at a New York news
conference in January. They may cringe at Tyson's outrageous
outbursts, from declaring that he'd like to eat Lewis' children to
making lewd sexual references to reporters. They may have rejected
the fight from New York to Nevada</TE>
<TE>   But there have been few negative vibes visible in Memphis.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson's handlers have the former two-time heavyweight champion on
a tight leash. The first time he and Lewis come face to face will be
around 8:15 PDT Saturday night when they enter the ring. They held
separate news conferences and had separate weigh-ins.</TE>
<TE>   And Tyson has gone with the flow, putting on a happy face the
world rarely sees. He literally hopped on the scales Thursday, like a
kid joyously getting on a bike for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson has been accused of faking his outbursts, of creating a
monster to sell tickets.</TE>
<TE>   There was a fear his unstable image might work against him this
week, discouraging people from buying the fight because of the
possibility he would self-destruct before it happened. Perhaps the
kinder, gentler Tyson has been created to assure one and all that
there will indeed be a match Saturday night at the Pyramid.</TE>
<TE>   It seems to be working. Only 10,000 to 12,000 fans are expected in
the 18,000-seat arena, those empty seats being blamed on exorbitant
ticket prices, which range from $2,400 to $250. But the pay-per-view
buys, at $54.95, are on a record pace. There already have been
400,000 orders--which would be considered a successful total for most
fights--through midweek in a business where nearly all pay-per-views
come in the last 48 hours.</TE>
<TE>   But it wouldn't be a Tyson fight without some sort of controversy.
Sure enough, after the two fighters weighed in Thursday--Lewis at 249
1/4, Tyson at 234 1/2--Ronnie Shields, Tyson's trainer, claimed the
scale was five pounds off, that Tyson had weighed 229 in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   But nothing has seemed to bother Tyson this week.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never been to the South before," he said, "but I went to
the inner city of Memphis and everybody looked like me. Everybody had
gold teeth in their mouth."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Tyson, home at last.</TE>

<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The respect that American soccer long has been seeking in Europe
finally is arriving. This week's victory over Portugal has opened a
few blinkered eyes and the U.S. national team is now viewed
differently.</LD>
<LD>   Some measure of respect was accorded to the team even before
Wednesday's 3-2 victory in Suwon, South Korea. Eusebio, the legendary
player who led Portugal to the quarterfinals of the 1966 World Cup,
where he finished as the tournament's leading goal scorer, warned
last month that the Americans might be a handful.</LD>
<LD>   "It is worth remembering that our group is not as easy as it seems
at first sight," said the "Black Panther," as he was known in his
playing days. "I saw the United States play against Uruguay [a 2-0
U.S. victory in Washington D.C. on May 12] and I was impressed with
the players' physical fitness."</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, two Italian World Cup standouts praised the U.S.
performance in its upset of Portugal.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. has developed a lot and did excellent things [in a 1-0
loss to Italy on Feb. 13]," said defender Paolo Maldini, an AC Milan
teammate of Portuguese midfielder Rui Costa.</TE>
<TE>   "I spoke to Rui Costa before the World Cup and he was seriously
worried about playing the Americans."</TE>
<TE>   Italian forward Filippo Inzaghi also praised the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "Denmark was incredible and obviously Senegal impressed me when
they beat France," he said. "But there are two teams--Senegal and the
United States--who have impressed me with the quality of their play."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brian McBride's headed goal against the Portuguese on Wednesday
was not only the game-winner but it made him the first American
player in history to score in two World Cups. McBride also scored
against Iran in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   U.S. defender Jeff Agoos is laughing off the own goal he scored in
the Portugal game when he accidentally volleyed a cross by Portuguese
forward Pauleta into his own net.</TE>
<TE>   "I got an e-mail from a friend of mine before the game and he
said, 'I have a feeling you're going to get a goal,' " Agoos said
Thursday. "I'm going to tell him to be more specific [next time]."</TE>
<TE>   Agoos also took some ribbing from U.S. teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple of the forwards asked me in practice this morning if
they could help me in finishing off [scoring] chances," he said.</TE>

<LD>The Sultan of Sanctimony has officially cleared his throat and become
fully engaged in these NBA Finals. On Wednesday night, moments after
his Lakers had flicked away the Nets' fourth-quarter charge, Phil
Jackson had scrawled on a locker room grease board: "Gave them
confidence. Take it back."</LD>
<LD>   He smells blood sprinkled in the designer water at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   He realizes the NBA Finals could well be over tonight, that the
Nets sit one more hard lesson away from joining his signature
scrap-heap of bloodied finals refugees. Yes, the Sultan knows the
signs as well as any coach in history.</LD>
<TE>   He knows a vulnerable team when he sees one.</TE>
<TE>   And he will be seeing one tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Forget everything else you know about these Nets for a moment.</TE>
<TE>   Ignore all the times when they boomeranged back from the brink,
making stands, taking charges, winning games they had no business
winning. Leave all of that in the past for now.</TE>
<TE>   "None of that will help us tonight," Keith Van Horn said. "This is
a pretty special challenge against a pretty unique team. All of our
focus has to be on the business at hand."</TE>
<TE>   And that business, spoken quite simply, is this:</TE>
<TE>   After tonight, we'll know if the Nets intend to keep the
competitive phase of these NBA Finals alive, extended to the other
side of the weekend at least. The only way they do this is with a
victory tonight against a Laker team that spent much of its off-day
engaged in self-flagellation, angered that it allowed the Nets to
sneak back into Game 1 and keep daring to dream.</TE>
<TE>   Tie the series at 1-1, then Sunday night in Jersey might just be
the best basketball party the state has seen.</TE>
<TE>   Go down, 2-0?</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't thought about being down 2-0," Jason Kidd said.</TE>
<TE>   Hard to blame them for that. For three playoff series, the Nets
heard their coach, Byron Scott, spit out old Pat Riley platitudes
such as this one: A team with a 2-0 lead in a best-of-seven series is
a team enjoying total control of that series. But even Scott has to
know that in this case, that saying would have to be altered.</TE>
<TE>   These Lakers with a 2-0 lead would be a mortal lock.</TE>
<TE>   And as much as the Nets have enjoyed spitting in the eyes of those
who would doubt them, winning four out of five from the Lakers
crosses the line from improbable to impossible. And if they lose
tonight, that would be the task ahead of them.</TE>
<TE>   Meaning this:</TE>
<TE>   They cannot lose tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "If we do," Kenyon Martin said, "then it will be over quick."</TE>
<TE>   Martin, of course, famously surmised that the Nets had lost the
Eastern Conference finals after mounting that epic collapse in Game
3. The sky never did fall on the Nets in that series, as it turned
out. But he's right about this.</TE>
<TE>   In the same way the Sultan of Sanctimony is right to urge his team
to step on the Nets' necks tonight. If they do that--and let's be
honest, they should do that--then not only will they spare their boss
the ignominious chore of learning, late in his coaching life, the
horrors of losing well.</TE>
<TE>   They also will set the sky falling. All over the Nets' hopes.</TE>
